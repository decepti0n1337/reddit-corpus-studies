The death blossoms event has a bug so it does the same thing the feed the people event used to do, it provides corpse flower stamens to the whole server, kinda helpful if you make... I think super Stimpaks use them? Idk I might be wrong

No discounts just 1600 caps and exclusive items. Just like there have always been exclusive items in the Atom Shop that people who didn’t want to pay for them don’t get. 
---

---
Nothing to see here - still. Time to move on.
---
Thank you for adding discussion. And not voicing your concerns or issues and just calling me a shill :)

I was at 0 of 750 yesterday. Got bat skin day before played 2 matches with over 100xp in each and only had 375 of 750 showing.

As a former programmer reading through this gave me anxiety. How did they miss so many little things like not labeling things correctly?
---
I just need that 5th stand
---
It's worth it to me!
---
Right. So if you’re a melee build you stand there with your dong in your hand waiting for them to land.
---
Yeah but not worth 5 perk points for an extra 7% damage
---
Right. ToW is a 20-30 hour play through. I have 20 times that time spent in fo76.
---
Also, the dollar breakdown for only 10 hours of gameplay for a 60 dollar game is 6 dollars an hour. Almost nothing is that cheap.
---
I understand the frustration of that and I hope its something that's addressed in the future, having the ability to alter game characteristics.
---
Its an always multilayer game though.. I think home grown servers would be a bit of an issue? I'm not a server expert or anything. But from what I see it seems like something that should be implimented.
---
Dude...10hours.. really.... give the game a chance.  Even if it sucks huge ass... you have not even been around long enough to give an opinion. That is like a graduate student telling a doctor how to do his job..... and I truly say this in fun as I love the game and people get way to serious....it is a game....
---
I had invited a stranger to my team, and then to my camp. Boy did I later find some text on the wall I WOULD NOT want on my camp. RIGHT NEXT TO FRONT DOOR TOO

You can live alone like a serial killer in your own den of evil. So there's building your own fort in a dark place and going to events to kill zombies. It's a feeling. It can be something for you.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
There's entire skeleton set in Summersville laundromat~
---
Btw that is a pretty cool tool 👍
---
Omg you're THAT house on Halloween
---
Im the leave me tf alone house on Halloween.

It wasn't playable when I quit. Now it's a play to win game and not worth playing.
---
I still get a good laugh thinking about it. I kinda wonder if he knew it was me.
---
If you see someone at a missle silo, swap servers.
---
That's quite a bit of explosive dmg, not bad
---
^
---
Worked that time
---
I agree with everything that you said, Idk how much time it took you to write this, but thats pretty much the truth I think.
---
I'd pay out the ass for TOW DLC. I'll try FO76 again once Wastelanders is released if they fix they pla to win bullshit.
---
Legit just got booted at the final stage of the event
---
How on earth would you know that?
---
Oh wow someone actually told me they understood it haha, ye usually it's all I ever have to say to these people now.
---
Constructive criticism towards bethesda is better then just attacking people because of what they do.
---
Hey that's what every anti fallout 1st people do in this subreddit. No need to salt the wound corporate scum!
---
It’s always been playable you’re a clown
---
I always end up dropping the dang things.
---
Bring back the Feed the People bug though. That was pretty sweet.
---
Mischief night.
---
Complains about mischief.
---
I hear you. It really takes the significance of their lies to another level when you consider that they are doing all this to the fan base that they owe their livelihoods to. Bethesda would not exist without the players. Why would you be so obtuse as to insult them so much and so often? **In the end we can all vote with our wallets.** They will never see another any of my money until they prove themselves worthy of it.
---
They can roll out the paid content but nothing the community has been asking for
---
Totally thought the drum was a hamburger with chopsticks coming out of it though.
---
My thoughts exactly were
---
"That seems oddly specific. Like too much for a emoji"
---
Lol yeah I drop them unless I happen to have the other ingredients I need, and I agree lol
---
I love how nobody thought it was a bug, but now feed the people doesn't actually feed the people
---
In all fairness. Im really against the fallout 1st membership and all. I have no problem fighting with the people in my guild over them giving into the monetizations. But honestly everything isn't pay to win (it's not like you can buy the best weapons/armor or bonuses), however it is pay to advantage (making the game easier within situations that should've been implemented into the game for free)
---
Maybe, wait for the wastelanders DLC for the world to be more fleshed out. The only thing I would say is that, incase you may find that you enjoy the game. It would be good to play a little more, to the see the map/world before the DLC, so you appreciate the changes.
---
Whatever makes you happy, you do you.
---
Yeah.........
---
*Camo paints look dopey as fuck.*
---
FTFY
---
My luck hasnt been that bad but I too am crashing alot
---
My GF and I had this same issue but it would sit on the loading screen every time until the event was already over at one point I counted a 5 min load time on XB1x and SSD i
---
Well, I guess to deliver that right Bethesda got to finally ditch that whole "Queen of Lacklustre" act all together.
---
Phrases like "Thank you" "Here you go" "Gone to blah blah" and sign it from your username,  would be a neat idea for that
---
Exactly what I meant. Something that prevents swearing, but also leaving something for others in the world.
---
The problem is it's the actualization of an unattractive trend. We know the limit of Vanilla and know that quality of life features  will never be found in game. 
---
Most companies who have failing games will release the base vanilla product for free without additions. And it is reasonable in that instance to charge for new content.
---
But this is, buy a base game (preferably at full price) and pay on top of that to get what is essentially end game content and improvements.
---
It's sleazy, hands down.
---
Obviously you just have no brain or no couth. Byeeee 🤘
---
🤡
---
If you play this game and support trashthesda, you’re the biggest kind of asshole.
---
The first response was just to shame you and the second was to be constructive.  
---
You have a choice, being a non-afflicted person, and to treat all criticism as you did Amyjane’s isn’t going to make any headway with making your intent known.
---
So was your intent to be shitty to the autistic or to just conjure the image of a meltdown as a simile to what is happening when people experience things out of their control?
---
What a waste of the courts time.
---
Best of luck to you!
---
Guild Wars 2 sells its expansions, they aren't free
---
How do you set up the survival tent?
---
I have thousands of hours in FO3, FNV, FO4, Oblivion, and Skyrim. I pre-ordered FO76 and played as much as I could but it was broken at launch. By the time I was ready to try again, it was a total shitstorm. I was eager for the Wastelanders update and now Bethesda made it a pay to win game complete with griefers. Now you tell me, why should I deal with all the bullshit when I can just play TOW? Maybe I'll try it again over the summer and they'll have it sorted out. I certainly hope so. I am a huge fan of Bethesda. I bought eleven copies of FO4 alone over the years (for friends, family and each of my consoles and PC). I don't even know how many copies of Skyrim, Skyrim Special Edition, and Skyrim VR I bought for myself and my loved ones. I was genuinely looking forward to doing the same for FO76. Hell I bought my buddy Dave a copy before launch so he wouldn't miss out. They fucked up bad, man. If I - of all people - only bought two copies of a Bethesda RPG, they fucked up bad.
---
That being said, I'm still hopeful for Starfield and planning on taking two days off of work when it launches. I'm not throwing Bethesda to the curb, I'm just upset with what happened in this particular case.
---
That's what i was thinking as well
---
That tells me everything I need to know about Bethesda's priorities.
---
To add insult to injury, it was the Bethesda Game Studios account responding to all of these with a standard tech support message, not a single one of the community managers responded to anyone on this.
---
Probably the best step going forward maybe? If it’s possible then local hosting could be a base feature save from the tents and scrap box with a maximum of 6 players, and then they could up the incentive for F1st with a choice of free outfits equal to 800 Atoms every month and visible deals from the word “go” that rotate every week or unique skins like giving the .44 a sequoia skin I think they call that a colt peacekeeper in real life?
---
I second you I think there bugged. Yesterday I got the AR and the 10mm skin. Today and I know I’ve gotten at least 2k experience, and nothing so far.
---
I paid $30 for 76 on xbox gold sale. I get soo many hours of entertainment from this game. sure, I dont want to pay a lot of actual dollars to keep it fun, but have no problem earning and spending in game currancy ( atoms and caps ) and I have no issue with spending aittle real money on dlcs from time to time.
---
i have no issue with them adding new functionalities to keep the game interesting, and i do plan to try the subscription if for no other reason than to add the sick Mothman dance to my emotes, then cancel it most likely. just my opinion.
---
Yes, teams can see other mates camps. It is common practice for surivalists to not play with vendors, hence why you see non or few camps.
---
No doubt! Xmas sweaters, trees. Maybe a snowman. A door wreath for 500 atoms.
---
Ever heard of the Simulation Theory? ;)
---
You... Clearly didn't read. Read again, carefully this time.
---
This is going to get thrown out before Dec 1.
---
No, you're condoning picking on people who are enjoying the game.
---
You don't have to support the product but don't grief people who do.  Be an adult.
---
Dont know if it works the same as in the us. But if it does, then you probably wont get anywhere. The company as far as i know, never made this promise. And the only evidence I've seen of this promise was from a single person.
---
With the sub you receive an option to place down a survival camp. On xbox, open up the wheel options to swap and press Y
---
Your right about edging the blast zone, or respawn options, but I seldom see it mentioned - Thanks for stating it clearly.
---
For what I've seen, there's quite a few "experienced" players that still aren't very knowledgeable / skilled in the zone - I'm sure you'll recall your first nuke zones were somewhat chaotic and disorienting. I wouldn't call those people "delicate", but I suspect they'll just decide it's not worth the effort. 
---
And I'm thinking that most new / lower level players aren't really equipped to deal with level 68 Glowing Ones, a hostile Whitespring security force, AND the challenges of surviving in the blast zone. So they'll just leave, and that's problematic for an event that may have been running (relatively) smoothly otherwise. 
---
No reason for me to think you might condone this tactic, and like you, not a big deal for me. But even though I've played since Beta, I still try to think about  the impact some activities may have on less experienced players. 
---
Now, all the more so, since a microscopic portion of the playerbase has indicated that they'll do everything they can to sabotage Fo76 as retaliation for Bethesda's decisions so far.
---
Have a problem? Well fix yet! Now introducing: Customer Support! Exclusively for Fallout 1st members!
---
Come check the video evidence on my mixer.com/at0m_bomb_baby
---
That sucks. I've participated in 3 and never crashed.
---
Brave, but foolish.
---
Considering how big of a company Zenimax is, this case will likely be dismissed in their favor.
---
*Hoo boy, this is the worst time do add these.*
---
I'm gonna hazard a guess that maybe they'll be smart enough to cancel the lot of "Red Chinese" theme items.
---
I've only had it crash once in 6 times, and I made it back in time for rewards. I've been one of the lucky ones with this game.
---
I think it'd be best if fo1st cost atoms, that way you could earn your subscription in game or buy atoms.
---
I suggest redacting personal info from your letter my friend.
---
Sounds accurate Lol
---
I'll keep playing FO4 and Skyrim and TOW and save FO76 for later. I still love Bethesda and am looking forward to Starfield. I can't believe how a company that has had the Midas touch for so long could screw the pooch like they did. These guys are the best of the best. How did this happen on **their** watch?
---
That doesn't answer anything, if you did the first challenge the day before that was before the next challenge even unlocked so it wouldn't have carried over if it could.
---
[deleted]
---
They don't care about non fu1 customers, and tbh I don't think they care about them either
---
That sucks, thankfully no issues on PS4 yet
---
Edit: except frame rate drop but no DC's
---
I’ll start grinding atoms, that can be useful when trying to actually gift something
---
You. Clearly. Are. Kidding. Me. To. Be. So. Bothered. By. This. Right?
---
Hey don’t disagree that them turning this into a paid service is trash. But I told myself I’d do it for ONE month and see what the fuss is about. Might as well offer the same luxury to someone else wanting to do the same thing right?
---
Cute
---
Insert cutting reference to your maternal progenitor here.
---
I would definitely spend my atoms on that!
---
Because text chat would fucking blow up the 4 servers they use for this game.
---
I never ever use my perk gum, I always leave it as a little love and thankyou
---
Yup, that’s my assumption too.  Hopefully they are items I actually like!
---
I did and now it is working!
---
The only issue see with that is the fact you’d spend 1300 Atoms each month to get 1650 which could just be used over and over constantly to duplicate Atoms, or if they pre-empted that and blocked the ability to do so as a result of a current subscription there would need to be another incentive in place of the free Atoms you’d get otherwise
---
Yes, I am Mexican Joker. You found me. Don't tell ICE, okay?
---
Hmmm listen to others and complain or play the game and make your own decision. what to do. What to do. It's a tough choice.
---
Couple of hours while at work
---
Pretty sure adding 5 trees would do more then text chat
---
It could be tweaked I guess.
---
Oh I'm so shamed now 😂 do you all feel better about yourselves? Do you feel like you've accomplished something? If you all care soooo much about Autism, get off the internet and go volunteer, or take classes or get a job where you actually do something for people. Attempting to shame people on the internet does absolutely nothing to help anyone besides making yourself feel better. So Shame away I'll still Say Autistic Shit Fit when people are acting like it 👍 and you will have accomplished absolutely nothing except stressing yourself out over a stranger on the internet
---
I alway use a revolver for the crits on this
---
At least we can be hopeful
---
20 years later Australia no longer has video games since all are banned and there is a prevalent black market with smugglers bringing games as it is seen as worse than heroin.
---
K bye
---
I didn't mean to come off accross shortly there. I wasn't sure what you had meant.
---
Aaaaand here we are.  You chose....
---
poorly.
---
I was wondering when I picked those up.
---
"great deal" wow dude you must have sunk an incredible amount of money into the game already if you're calling First a good deal. keep shilling for shitty tactics, Bethesda loves you for it
---
I agree.   
---
If we are only talking about the concept of in-game purchases, the implementation of the Atom Store and it's management has been a disaster.   
---
Prices are way too high. They don't create a sense of rarity or specialness (like the super expensive WoW Mounts), but instead go past that and come across as foolishly greedy. And I think that that initial problem likely screwed with their data when analyzing the store.   
---
What players want is more content for an affordable price. And content that is actually useful.  
---
I know someone worked on it, but a hair style shouldn't cost more than $0.50. Same for an emote. A big flashy PA skin should cost maybe a few dollars, but that's ALL.
---
I know right... guess he was too excited to post and forgot...lol
---
pay to win?
---
nope pay to get support!
---
;-)
---
I don't really care about people having my email
---
Let’s be real here, anyone who doesn’t have a subscription yet is just extremely poor and jealous.
---
Great example of a terrible title and an idiotic analogy
---
Aaand here we are.  You chose...
---
So if anyone is having issues finding these in challenges in your menu, I have to be in AV mode not NW mode, they are under character challenges, mine are at the 2 st from the top. They do not seem to reset to 0 when done, but I could be wrong, will update post after I grab another if I am wrong.
---
Okie dokie, good luck with that
---
It's been pretty routine for me after each new update, namely with content updates such as events.
---
Yeah, this is a hell of a good way to get doxxed. Hopefully, that doesn't happen.
---
Fallout first is the best thing to come to Fallout 76. Private servers, Uncontested workshops, infinite scrape storage, 1650 Atoms a month. 
---
Why wait buy it now for a low low introductory price!!
---
Hmmm. You went from 7 votes to -2. Seems like the shills are out in full force. 
---
Thanks for the info. Anything that is downvotes that much must have some meaning.
---
He seems innocent enough but leaving his email and name in the letter wasn't smart. Then again it is his reddit user name smh.
---
that’s what you get for canceling
---
Trying to RP as a Firebreather but got it at lvl 10
---
I think that's the point really. What SmakzMS is saying is that THAT is how the company sees it because that is how companies see things.   
---
That doesn't make it right. It's just that, to them, you don't matter unless they can get more cash out of you. It shouldn't be that way, but that's how big AAA game studios tend to treat customers.
---
Never accept an invite from a random... lol
---
It'd be really nice! So many times I've left things at peoples camps and wanted to leave a note with "Here you go" if I've noticed they're missing teddy bears, or other display things
---
I give up with this game and I'm done with Bethesda for the most part (I may get the next doom as it may not be corrupted with this plauge) as they for one should never ever have implemented fallout 1st as fallout 76 had one foot in the grave the moment it was released and although it started to get out of that deep deep dark grave Bethesda decided to finally finda a way to kill off a lot of the love for them and the game from their most hardcore fans
---
You need to consider that the only community Bethesda cares about is the community that's buying things.  And those guys are buying utility items.
---
If you're not buying anything then the only use Bethesda has for you is basically as a free-to-them advanced bot for the paying players to interact with in order to improve their gameplay experience - and keep them buying.
---
Gawd, you’re dumb.
---
System?
---
Just looking out for you my friend honestly there's a lot of bored people out there who could do a lot of bad things with it. 
---
At the least you'll be subscribed to all kinds of horrible stuff. If it's linked to any accounts you may get hacked I hope your passwords are strong and 2-step verification is enabled on everything.
---
Xbox
---
Ope. You got me.
---
Why? What other recourse outside of complaining on Reddit do gamers have against the ever expanding avarice of video game publishers?
---
They lied, the protectron was in the game originally. They deliberately ignore any criticism of the microtransactions. They're unable to release new content without it being bugged. I gave them a grand of my money, including atoms and special editions, they lied in emails to me and this is the mechanism for dealing with consumer law in the state of Victoria. 
---
Save me your indignation
---
PlayStation here, sorry.
---
You already spent the money, just play the game
---
&gt;I never said you played 76
---
And I never said you did. I said you *assumed* it. Never said you said it. See how ridiculous this is getting?
---
There were however multiple times when you talked about me as if I was an active player. And yes, I can quote you, but I'm not going to because I want this conversation to end.
---
&gt;You, YOU went on about how is it fair that you were always ganked by higher level players.
---
And if you read the rest of my post and didn't just focus on the first two sentences you also saw that it ended with me saying: "But that's not the point. The point is that they weren't doing anything wrong according to the rules of the game."
---
&gt;Sure it's part of the game, but that ruins the experience for lower level people. Am I making my self clear?
---
No disagreement there. The only thing I disagree with is who's ultimately responsible for it. I've said right from the start that it's the developers.
---
&gt;Apparently you're smarter than Bethesda.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Maybe you should get a job with them and help guide them.
---
Maybe you should go to wikipedia and read about straw man argument. After you're done reading about ad hominem.
---
&gt;Insulting someone is not necessarily an instance of an ad hominem fallacy.
---
No that's just a personal attack, which is even dumber. But talking about them wanting to target players in Fallout as revenge for having been bullied is a perfect example of ad hominem. Instead of arguing against what I was actually saying you attacked me personally by arguing against my motive. A motive which I didn't even have. And thus you avoided genuine discussion of the subject. Ad hominem in a nutshell.
---
Are we done now? Like seriously dude.
---
You’re good
---
Yes you do.
---
You should or at least hear a ding if you’re in your pip or other screens, otherwise is says (gt) just purchase X
---
&gt;But delta doesn’t just ignore a regular passenger when they try to get your attention.
---
Welcome to 2019, time traveler from the 1980s! While I am sure you will enjoy many things about our miraculous modern era, I must caution you to **not** fly domestic with **any** US carrier. We're all accustomed to it, but judging by your post...they'd break your spirit (plus your luggage and, if United, your face).
---
Is there really any other thread they should be commenting?
---
Power it, add stuff to it, and wait. The caps for a sale are added directly to your inventory at a 10% loss, and you get a little notification with sound.
---
I imagine it's a combination of things.
---
* Needing an interim game that required little development costs but considerable revenue to help fund the gap/creating new technology for the future BGS games such as Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6
---
* Pressure from upper management/the parent company/the board of directors to push towards a more profitable business model of monetization and microtransactions to gain money even after the games release.
---
* Zenimax Studios looking to sell their stake in Bethesda so possibly trying to create a membership business model that is a more reliable revenue then sporadic atomic shop sales, which inturn is more enticing to investors.
---
Given human nature and how divided this subreddit is it seems like a really bad idea.
---
Lol even now they are so incompetent they can’t even get there subscriptions done right
---
Lol, you're welcome. Just playing the game and using the features available. If you don't like it, feel free to rub it on your chest.
---
Sadly, no. That's not correct.   
---
You purchased a license for temporary use of the game Fallout 76. That's what's in that end user agreement you sign when installing the game. You don't own that game and they can stop supporting it whenever they want.   
---
It is UTTER BULLSHIT, but legally that's the case. It's been that way for like 20 years now.   
---
Now, according to that contract (and it is a LEGAL contract you agreed to if you installed the game) you do have rights as a client who has purchased that license. But only those rights listed in the contract.  
---
So if Bethesda announced tomorrow that they were just shutting down the Fallout 76 servers. We'd all be SOL with no recourse.   
---
The only time you can really go after the company is like with Gearbox and Aliens Colonial Marines. Where you sue them for false advertisement. Basically that they sold the game with faked screenshots and videos that did NOT accurately depict gameplay. That's fraud and is actionable. But that's kinda it.   
---
Sucks massively.
---
Annnnnd you dont have a response  lol because you know I'm right and you dont actually do anything to help people you just "shame" people on the internet. Again what have you actually accomplished with this whole  attempt at shaming someone?
---
Won’t even make it in front of a judge. Complete waste of time for the courts.
---
Indeed. I've been on the net since 1997 and on dial up BBSs before that (fidonet was no better in some quarters). 
---
I'm not insulted nor stressed, but I have known families who have dealt with autism and using what they usually term as "melt downs" as a descriptor for the immature tantrums of so called "trolls" is only superficially applicable at best. 
---
But hey, you go ahead and tell us how you feel while caring not a wit about how someone else might. 
---
Shout at the darkness. 
---
Imma light a candle.
---
This is a colossal waste of time, you guys do this just for imaginary internet applause and karma? This is genuinely sad. I'm not even kidding I feel sad for you that you have nothing better or more significant to do in your life than be mad at a video game.
---
Also hide your info buddy.
---
You will .... you will ....
---
This could be why they suspended the service for everyone.
---
thanks, i dont think i added power. good to know
---
&gt;This sub's shills are getting ridiculous.
---
ftfy
---
Will there really be one tho, the community is still pretty salty from last week and there was none then
---
I haven't tested it yet, but I'm wondering if I can rinse and repeat for free monthly atoms? I guess we'll see

Then you are just a thief.
---
I replied to the wrong comment but this was a broad reply to a few people who leaned the other way.
---
Edit: also was trying to make funny
---
So basically you tried to cheat Bethesda and they ended up cheating you instead. Hahahaha!
---
It's like all the players who still play the game are nice to each other cus they all know deep down the game is shit, and they want to cheer each other up. Hang in there brother, maybe some day the game will be good.
---
Wow you really compared rape to a video game? 
---
Get a life you loser.
---
This is news and I've been on here for a minute now
---
I’m looking for the short suit, you willing to sell it?
---
Its tough when you have no friends and get a atom challenge requiring a group
---
Maybe it might not work and the scrap bot won’t work but the other items you will own them so yea hope it works out might try on pc
---
Did they ban you from the forums for criticizing their Fallout First subscription move? You wouldn't be the first.
---
You need to be a fallout first subscriber- peasants don’t get the tent
---
Imagine having this much free time to file frivolous lawsuits.
---
Bad idea anywhere but I agree with you about here more! (Nervous lol)
---
Because he’s a poor.
---
(a) I don't care about upvotes. There was a senate inquiry into video games in Australia. It's a multi billion dollar industry. It's actually something that took me less time than emailing back and forth for days with Bethesda support. It's possibly going to work, and get me my money back
---
[removed]
---
You're the unethical one, not Bethesda.
---
Again, these are great. The satellite array is very interesting. People may not know, but it is radio silence around the area. No. Cell. Phones. Can you imagine being a high school kid and using a land line to call your friends?  We skied at SnowShoe and you can go past this area to get there. Kids will go to the resort because AT&amp;T has a tower just for the resort. Otherwise, nothing.
---
True.Though in IT and most of the world there's a saying.  
---
Fast, Cheap or Good. You can get a job done with 2 of those but not all 3.  
---
You can get it cheap and fast, but it won't be "good", and you can get it cheap and good, but it won't be "fast", and so forth.
---
In a perfect world, Bethesda could do both. And they really SHOULD do both. However, in a perfect world, they would have delayed the game 6 months and released it in an actually functional state with NPCs and story content included (instead of promised someday in Wastelanders). But they didn't do that. Probably because someone up the corporate ladder said that it HAD TO LAUNCH ON TIME!!! And Bethesda Austin probably didn't have the staff or resources to do both.
---
My guess is that Bethesda Austin is running ragged right now. If they had the people and money to pull it off, they would have been able to launch BOTH the subscription service and Wastelanders at the same time. But they didn't, so we got the option that would benefit them the most in the short term.
---
Same deal's likley happening here sadly. Too many issues to fix and not enough staff. So likely someone uptop made the call to fix the subscription problems first.
---
Forgive him, he’s a poor.
---
Its not frivolous in countries with consumer rights
---
The ranger outfit works and I kept the atoms, scrap box I can't add to it but I can pull from it.
---
My apologies to you. I hope you have a rich and varied existence full of joy.
---
Also, did you spot any Yao Guai roaming in front of Dolly Sods?
---
No... It's not...
---
On Ps4 (PS4 PRO) I'm 4 for 4, no problems.
---
(Ps4  PRO, EU, fibre, no wifi).
---
*So now the degenerates have shown their faces. Caesar has a cross ready for them!*
---
Completely agree but there are a few great groups both here and on FB with the majority that enjoy and love the game. 
---
I’ve met a lot of great peeps in the wasteland, I’d look at a few groups on here for starters and there’s a ton on FB.
---
This might be a strange one; but I use both.
---
I'm running a mostly heavy weapons build, but since I'm a Charisma group-support build, the main reason I run around with PA is for the instant Stimpak usage. I don't take any of the normal armor perk cards (Can't really get anything out of them with my point spread while covering the utility cards I need to take; S9 P3 E6 C15 I15 A3 L5), so it kind of plays out that the PA is there for if I *really* need to stay alive/keep the team alive/put out a little bit of extra DPS.
---
Since I have *Empath*, any amount of extra armour is direly appreciated, especially when solo, ergo.. I'm quite fine and happy to run around in PA.
---
You already get legendary drops from some events so they only have to change it.
---
I mean, the low level effort posts on here that tries to "save" the image of the game. Like the "someone left candy and nuka cola on my bed, best moment ever in the game!" are laughable.
---
You show your name and email to reddit??
---
Hey thank you so much for posting this!  I got the pirate costume hoping for a hat to complete it!  I love it.
---
It’s not going to work- this is laughable.
---
Might be the most pathetic thing I've seen on the internet today.
---
Congrats.
---
I acted completely within Xbox policy, so no. If anything I was just forcing Bethesda to keep their promise of free content updates
---
Awesome
---
Build a camp in Fallout 4.
---
What consumer right was infracted on here?
---
Maybe, glad I got when the getting was good
---
I have that.
---
I get it, they just handled everything so poorly and that isn't like Bethesda. I don't think they'll repeat these mistakes in future games, however. Starfield is going to be awesome and so will Elder Scrolls VI. Fallout will benefit from the break. If they would just add a single player mode, I would be happy. The lack of human NPCs wasn't a big deal for me. It was having to deal with other players. I don't like people, I'm a retail manager. I play Bethesda RPGs so I don't have to deal with people. I feel like because it's a MMO (kinda), I shouldn't ignore all the bullshit. In a few months I'll try it again. A little bit of obscurity would do this game well right about now.
---
Thanks, done a ton of testing since then,  it boils down to this - When you load into the area the rules are - 1. Has SB been looted by someone already in the last X amount of time? If yes, then nothing spawns. If no, then 2. Has this stealthboy already being looted by the player within the last 180 items picked up? If yes, then wait until they've looted 180 items. If no, then roll with a 80% chance of none.   The X amount of time is unknown, somewhere between 30 minutes and a hour.  
---
 80% Chance of none was info from a data miner.
---
Cranberry relish or any recipes with cranberries will give you extra XP
---
Ok here is the link with all the info first comment of that discussion:

---
To your point of Hines saying the atomic shop to fund future content.  It could be, maybe, that plan didnt work as well as he originally though.  Maybe, there simply weren't enough players purchasing from it to fund future content.  That possibly could've led to the Fallout 1st sub.  We won't really know unless we see the projected cost to maintain FO76, the cost for upcoming DLC, and how much profit they actually made from atomic shop sales.
---
Fallout 4 doesn’t have the same principles as 76, though. And besides, not as many decoration options in 4.
---
This should be a thing available for everyone.
---
I like to build in areas with some structures already there. Sometimes you can find free workbenches at random places. Or shacks etc.
---
For the Pelvis there is two of them on the bass and the Whitespring Bunker entrance. Some other various Parts can be found at point pleasant.
---
That's a weak argument. That's like saying the steak at Golden Corral is better than Ruth's Chris because you can eat so much more steak at Golden Corral. 
---
The Outer Worlds is  20-40 hours a play through, and anybody who plays it once will want to play it again differently. It is so much better than FO76.
---
Wearing a confederate uniform with blackface... interesting....
---
I know you're right. Just wanted to bitch. I'll delete this post so I don't piss in anyone else's Cheerios. My bad.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
Nope. Do not like
---
Just some bodies...and plenty of springs!
---
Done about 12 at this point all over 4G and no crashes here (PC)
---
&gt;I think what you're hearing are fans of the game (because they enjoy either 76 or the franchise in general) and they are venting frustration because they are experiencing things beyond their control, and in feeling helpless
---
Yes, certainly that...and a whole bunch of trolls that don't  play the game, some of whom have never even tried it and have never posted in the sub before last week. Just look at the profiles of some of the most virulent...sure, some are regulars but a ton are not
---
"And I never said you did. I said you assumed it. Never said you said it." What? You talk like you actively play it. So you're just a phoney. Got it.  You dont actively play the game, you literally have no grounds of authority to discuss anything about it. Period.
---
What rules? Perhaps you can point out specifically in black and white those rules. I guarantee you cant.  I focused on your whole comment, I chose not to comment on the "But that's not the point. The point is that they weren't doing anything wrong according to the rules of the game" because I guarantee that's not in the rules. And I take the risk saying that having never read the rules, nor played WoW.
---
You might want to look up straw man yourself.  I've pointed out the errors in your logic and simply suggested you help out the company.  No straw man about it.  You've given enough indication that you believe the developers designed the game this way all the while knowing people were going to specifically target 1st Subscribers. That's just wrong.
---
The closest you can get to saying I'm attacking, insulting (insert what ever colourful word you decide) in this conversation, is that I lumped you in with the garbage players who want to go out of their way to make the game unplayable for others.
---
By this E with demo expert one is better DPS then FFR.
---
That's just as much of a gameplay advantage, and one that would piss off way more people than a stupid tent, and private instance that isn't private.
---
I'd say good luck, but they've probably done nothing wrong in the eyes of the law, and it'll be thrown out
---
not if your alone in a private server ;-)
---
What did I miss, since someone got it deleted?
---
Thank you for your kind words as a raider I'm allways happy to hear that my goodwork is noticed, best of luck with those costumes in the nuke zone. I'll be sitting on my deck with drink hopeing I get a few kills.
---
I never for a second thought it would be for everything 
---
I had assumed that there would be a few items up on the store for a bit less than the other stuff for the first members 
---
Be less salty, I haven’t complained
---
Australia may have a lot of consumer rights, yet this is a nothing case where it'll probably get thrown out
---
Thanks!  I think this area was one of my favorites. I had always wanted to see the big one in person. I'm gonna go back sometime when I can take the tour. And you're right about the cells. I didn't have service for a good part of the trip around there.
---
Agreed. Hair styles costing more than $1.00 is ridiculous.

Here you go buddy. Have fun.
---
Call me Robin Hood 😂
---
No you were not, you are not Robin Hood when you steal for your own pleasure.
---
I did make a post, but it wasn't about hating the subscription, just the scrapbox.
---
?
---
This seems really fake
---
Incivility is bannable on this sub btw.
---
I’m getting this a lot, especially when other events pop up, can’t seem to handle it plus another event
---
Dude, this isn't going to work. In fact I'm pretty sure your first "court date" will be the judge telling you not to waste the courts time.
---
I'm spreading the good word currently. Bethesda's pricing model, timing on releasing fallout first and their inclusion of exclusive outfits, emotes and content is predatory and has gone against their word. And yes I was acting within Xbox policy, because that policy is what allows me to get a refund lmao
---
It’s just a joke but I can add The /s to make it super clear
---
Bethesda's serving their true customers - money.
---
I'm sure the tempban will be just a joke too... Oh wait. It won't.
---
I also wish you luck. If you make any traction it can open the door to anyone in Australia doing the same. 
---
Game makers should be held to their word like any other service providers. They said cosmetic only, they've clearly gone past that. They said every other person you see will be a real person, we'll they're adding human NPCs in wastelanders.
---
This comment wins.
---
&gt;Amusei: 
---
&gt;For someone who hates the game you come onto the forum to comment. Curious.
---
Look at his post history...he's active on reddit for other games, just not FO76. So yet another troll here to fan the flames
---
Not overly worried. You are being a bit sensitive.
---
Most people can take a joke as it is, a joke.
---
Lol that's like saying you're not racist cause you know a black person. Congratulations you've met people with Autism so have I. Did I say something horrible about Autistic people or to an Autistic person? No I did not nor would i, I mocked whiny little fucks who are keyword here CHOOOSING to behave that way because they didnt get their way. Now you are all pretending to be victimized cause someone said something  you didnt like and all this fake outrage is laughable. I ask you all again what have you done to help people with Autism here? Pull your heads out of your asses and go Volunteer or Donate to a Charity if you're genuinely outraged and actually do something other than Virtue Signaling At me cause you will not accomplish anything.
---
The only reason to have sofas chairs and non display other furniture is to make it look like someone lives in your camp. Some people don't care about it, but if I have extra space may as well use it I guess
---
Probably run of the mill false advertising.
---
Sadly i don't live in aus so I'm not up too speed on their laws but aus has some of the more robust ones out there
---
I couldnt care less what you say. I was just tryinf to warn you that people have been banned for inciting class wars in comments sections. 
---
Be it a joke or not.
---
Ya that's the way to go. Also recommend building near something that has high radiation incase you want to radiate yourself for a bloodied build
---
He got a date in front of a tribunal. One would think it wouldn't get that far if it were to be thrown out
---
Seem to care a lot. Downvote and move on with your day maybe?  
---
Try to lighten up in the future :)
---
PC...  
---
Around Patch 9.5 a weird bug occured that is forcing '76 to run on the wrong GPU (lower performance one) and it's effectively rendering the game 3 times.. (GPU0--&gt;GPU1--&gt;GPU0 which has the monitor connected)
---
You bought a product with clear intended of obtaining it without paying for it, that’s like a definition of fraud. I’m guessing tomorrow is your usual routine with jumping in front of slowly moving cars in order to get insurance money as prices for car insurance are outrages.
---
I thought I ran into people killing the 3 stars in uranium fever. Turns out I chunked the moles fast and their loot just went away because that's what I get for trying to play the game
---
I didn't downvote you?
---
Yeahhhhhh, totes not going to believe anything coming out of your mouth. I also didnt spend 100 dollars. Also what fucking bugs are you even talking about???? I play on fucking satnet, I never crash and i dont experience half the bugs people talk about, so i honestly believe yall just got some defective ass consoles or pcs.
---
If you actually believe the words you're writing here then I don't know what to say...
---
Nah scratch that I do know what to say: Therapy. Seek it.
---
Cool
---
I think they settled for fast and cheep on many of these updates. Bugs being ported from FO4, reselling assets from FO4 in the atom shop, not playtesting patches, very little solo content added in the past year etc. they have had 3 major additions in the past year, survival-dead, Nuclear winter- collapsing under the weight of cheaters, raids- very poorly received and rarely used.
---
Keep your budget maxed with something cheap; like a Wooden Stash Box pyramid. Then people can't build in your Camp. As for this topic it's solved by Bethesda being willing to add report button and system if it really bothers people that much what's written in a note, or just turning the feature off with parental controls.. I'd like that feature personally with or without.
---
1. There are no private servers, paid or otherwise. Non-persistent private instances (to the extent that's even been provided, which is unclear) are not the same kind of expense.
---
2. There are already documented instances of a shift in resources away from non-premium customer service/support to premium customer service/support. You're pretending they just added more stuff/staff and haven't taken anything away from non-premium, but in fact they're simply redirecting a fixed pool of resources in a way that benefits new money at the expense of paid customers.
---
3. We all agree it's PTW; you don't mind it, others do.
---
4. Free DLC isn't a gift or a fucking favor to players - it was part of the sales pitch and the basis on which people bought the game in the first place.
---
IT's also the precise kind of toxic behavior that make a lot of us not want multiplayer.
---
Pretty sure a lot of people get that far
---
Bethesda's, or bethesda's community managers? The community managers are only really allowed to regurgitate pre-approved PR messages or tell people to file support tickets
---
I'm not a huge hater of 1st. I bought it because k wanted something from atom shop anyways. But the main gripe for me is lack of options for private server it's not really what ppl want out of it
---
Crashed 2 or 3 of 8 so far
---
yes but it only shows up for a few seconds
---
i wish the game would track what ppl bought from you
---
Congrats on wasting everyone's time!
---
Words aren't really binding
---
I'm not being victimized. In fact I haven't even downvoted any of your posts. I simply pointed something out, you supplied the angst. 
---
Throw all the buzz words at me you like. We're done here.
---
welcome to the wasteland
---
This is very long and should be emailed to bethesda asap
---
Look you can lick Bethesda's boots all you want, it won't make them stop milking you for all you have. My method is within policy so there is no crime or fraud committed, my conscious is completely clear
---
I went idle too long while camping the ammunition’s joint while working and when I relaunched a private session within a couple minutes my workshop was still there with ammo accumulated.  There’s some kind of grace period at least for idle kick off.
---
Awesome. Me and my gf have made a couple trips up and visted some locations. We just came back from the kenova pumpkin house festival and Camden Park. To be real the current Camden park looks like post apocalyptic Camden park.
---
Lawyer up? 
---
If they're really pulled into court I'm pretty sure they'll have a team of lawyers on retainer. 
---
IMO this is absolutely silly but if you feel that wronged by it by all means proceed. Part of me hopes it goes somewhere just for the viewing of it all go down.
---
Do you have to compete with other players to get to the resources that do spawn first? 
---
Did not think so...
---
Its not that i dont like fallout 1st, i actually think its resonably priced for everything you get with it. I also always knew that private servers were gonna be payed, and i wont be surprised if we have to pay for mods when they eventually add them.
---
The issue i have personally is they they have broken almost every promise they have made to us (they couldn't even get there preorder stuff right). All this on top of the subscription service makes me think that, it may not exactly be pay to win yet, but there going the right way to it, and its a slippery slope.
---
I also understand the frustration with people who have payed for it and they are helping lead Bethesda into thinking we want this, when all it takes is a look at this one Reddit community to see that a good portion of playerbase doesn't. In saying this, i don't condone ingame action against these players.
---
Whatever you posted simply says removed, so someone got it taken down. I'm curious as to what it was though. Mostly because I'm quite over this 1st bullshit, and I enjoy laughing at the things it broke, and asks us to still pay for.
---
I don’t like the idea as a mostly single player.  I wouldn’t care about shared loot though which is probably the bigger draw anyway.
---
It's more like private sessions are in fact a service provided. Would I have paid for the service if it came with just Atoms, the skin and emotes? Probably. I was willing to pay for just private sessions and that's it when it was announced at Gencon. Everyone should have gotten the scrap boxes and tents, that's the only thing I agree with.
---
Well if they're following ESO so much, respec will be a purchasable thing here in no time...?
---
another thing to consider is that hits with a legendary with explosive effect counts as 2 hits. This will trigger effects like "one gun army" more often but will also mean your weapon will break faster since durability decreases with every hit
---
with explosive you can get a bit more damage by using demolition expert (somewhere around 10%)
---
with FFR you get a 25% DPS increase without any additional perk investment
---
so if i were in your shoes it would boil down to: do i want to invest in another rank 5 perk or not.
---
Fallout ain't rust. And the game wasnt made for toxic and childish behavior. Like you wanna play rust, go play rust. Fallout isn't rust and rust ain't fallout and you shouldn't have ever compared them. Bothering people that have no interest in dealing with your dumb shit and make it obivious that they aren't, just goes to show you're a fucking manchild and have serious social issues.
---
Silly. Good luck with that.
---
you can almost completely negate that damage to yourself by using the fireproof perk, which has a few other benefits that come with it. such as immunity to scorchbeast sonic attacks
---
Thanks ;)
---
We have a hulk
---
Not on PC, sorry. Not like I don’t use Nexus, either, I just use it for New Vegas.
---
He was asked on Twitter if you could buy a legendary mini gun and his response was “no cosmetic only”. And you all think we should sue over that?
---
And we should sue for them adding content? You people are crazy.
---
Yeah, then you just payed 15 bucks a month to play an mmo by yourself.  Sounds pretty counterproductive to me.
---
On both my Xbox1X and OG Xbox1 zero issues. Either you are using an external drive and needs to be powered and/or better shorter usb cable or you have shitty internet that can not keep up with the packets.
---
I think the most valuable thing you can get from workshops is fusion cores, since they can be a pain to farm otherwise for gatling laser builds.
---
Anyone can get in front of a tribunal lol.
---
Thanks for the comment, any chance you could give me a couple pics?  
---
(BTW ask for a refund if it's that bad)
---
A grand? And people like you are calling me a whale for spending 100 bucks for a year of 1st. Thank you for giving me a good belly laugh tonight bud.
---
That's a great idea! When ever I find a camp where someone is just giving stuff away I always wondered how to find them and say thanks. This needs to become a thing.
---
As someone with a background in consumer rights law (NSW), I'm going to warn you that as much as you ***might*** (And I stress that heavily - **MIGHT**) have a valid statement in the matter, you aren't going to find a resolution at state level. You'll end up heading to a Supreme Court (Federal), and it's not going to be a one-and-done matter. You'll be going back. Repeatedly. And if you're a regular Joe, that's going to be an absolutely crippling endeavor. The costs are going to send you to the poor house, and finding representation (Solicitor/SC) willing to take the job and not just run things out to play games with you is going to be an even larger challenge than the cost of hiring them.
---
Video games are not seen with any sort of respect over here as they are in the US. Both in terms of black and white law and general public opinion. It's a struggling market over here. It's going to be an uphill battle, and you're going to need to bankroll it - and live with the domino-effect consequences if you *win* wherein things become more difficult/complicated for game developers to release titles over here.
---
I suppose, if you were covering what my fees used to be, I'd recommend you, "Just sit down and take a deep breath, old son. It ain't worth it."
---
or maybe fix the bugs faster ;)    
---
Joking aside, just hope it helps
---
You used the GTA example, not me. 
---
Yes it is. It is not free to download and therefore it is a charge to play online. Buying a game for money automatically means it is not free to play. 
---
I'm not moaning about anything except how your entire post is flawed objectively. I laid it out for you but you didn't have a response for any of it
---
Want to argue but...
---
Well after the issue with 1st memberships for a few hours today and not being recognized as one. I wasnt able to put my crap in my scrap box, however, I was able to use it. So it seems like it works out perfectly.
---
How exactly have you been harmed? It’s not against the law for software to have bugs lol. And they work to fix them.
---
it's either do this or quit....  
---
I guess I'm a masochist ;)
---
Howd you get so close to the smaller telescopes without being on the tour? Was this just some tactical camera stuff to get the fence out of the shot?
---
Well to be fair, id probably love the game too if i used my moms credit card to buy a better version of the game.
---
So THATS what they want us to do with all the tp they placed in bathrooms.
---
I was level 90 at a workshop and 3 level 20 guys came to to reclaim it(I took it earlier). They couldn't kill me so eventually the went to their camp not to far away. One of them in the group though accidentally tried to seek revenge, so I went to their house broke down their door and stabbed them all to death. Then I took a picture of the crime scene and sent it to one of them saying "Don't mess with raider territory".
---
$100.00 says the person putting the project together didn't have enough time and support, it's easy to make little mistakes when you're focused on making sure the larger project works.
---
Pennies from heaven, the gods have looked upon you friend. Thank eru illuvatar
---
Crashed 2 out of 3 events tonight. Def don't have time to babysit an hourly event on a work day if it's going to crash that much. Waste of time for me unfortunately. Disappointing for sure.
---
Since its pretty likely you'll want to move in the future, i recommend keeping things pretty modular. 
---
What I mean by that is have like, your house, a generator room, a workshop and a shop. Or some combination of those. That way you can blueprint them (and they won't overflow the budget) for placing them down again at the new location. 
---
The building system is finicky as hell when you want to place structures down, so the smaller the better IMO. A giant does-everything structure will very likely refuse to plop down.
---
Make sure to both put it behind a paywall and make only Fallout 1st subs be able to buy it. Based on Zenimax's data on how much we love spending money on features this is the only way something so useful will go over well
---
Ok lol I could care less about votes. Again none of you have answered the question of what have you actually done to help folks with Autism? And have a good day sir 👍 dont let the door hit you on the way out
---
I do agree that it would be much harder but honestly I solo nuke zones no problem and with a public event it is just that much easier. I wonder if anyone thought about the fact Bethesda certainly left WS nukable so people could do it and up the rewards. I mean meat week had build restrictions and plenty of places on the map you cant nuke so I'm sure it would not have been hard to stop this behavior but for my vote I say nuke it and I got your back.(I might need to bum some stims though.)
---
My understanding is they playtest, but on private servers missing out on the non-developer human at large element.
---
Yeah but lack of outcry leads to corporate acceptance which leads to normalization which leads to worse games for more money, which is what is happening in basically all games.
---
Regardless, I was just saying you quoting him as saying he hated it was wrong
---
Just wait until you see your own comment!
---
I’m the only one exited to this imagine creating our faction against the others
---
Nice!
---
IF I wanted that kind of bullshit in my RPG I'd renew my WoW subscription.
---
Snag a gamma gun from an enemy ;)
---
You'd have to think of an existing value that governments use to regulate business that Zenimax is breaking. Like lootboxes are being discussed in courts because they relate to gambling for minors. 
---
So what unlawful activity did they practice?  Where in our purchase contract did it say they would never shift what items were being sold?  Is anything they're doing harmful?  This is a tough one other than saying the lied. 
---
If its not a competitive game with winnings and official leagues involved, then pay to win doesn't matter.
---
Right now, no. Especially with all this Fallout 1st crap. I’d wait to see what the reception to Wastelanders is before you go out and buy it.
---
Should just repurpose harpoons for this purpose
---
Oh lmao. Well I got fallout 1st and xbox has a return policy on subscriptions that if you cancel within 1 month then you get a full refund. So I got my full refund but got to keep the atoms and the ranger armor. Completely within Xbox policy and the subreddit rules so I'm not sure what boot licker removed my post but that's the gist of it
---
Vcat decisions are binding, so it's a matter of federal and state law. I'm going pro se
---
It falls under dishonest conduct
---
I'm 28 and used my own. Congrats on the failed personal attack. I'm not sure how getting a private server gives me a better version of the game. I just dont have to deal with the lag of 23 other players actions and I can be left alone in peace in workshops and events.
---
Isnt ammo crafting cheaper? Plus the 40/80 perk card?

---
I just read your post saying you need to read my post.
---
Thank you as always..  
---
1) Documented, heard this a couple times.  
---
2) Same old Fast travel bug or?  
---
3) the event lag or more do you think?  
---
4) Crap, you just confirmed a bug that occurred today while on discord, player was stuck in a respawn loop for a few minutes.  
---
5) Hmmm
---
My game crashed at the very end of it
---
I m unsubscribing it for now. Luckily didnt take the 1 year package.
---
Rejoin someone that was on it no other way  unless u server hop
---
Why would anyone hire someone to shit on this game when it shits on itself? I think this is a little far fetched but to think that even most people liked fo76 you're delusional.
---
Nope. If you somone with the membership leaves for a few minutes they can get back in the same instance they were in before, but the game closing, IIRC means you lose that instance entirely.
---
I think the tent is more an issue than the scrap box because it gives you stash access virtually anywhere, making weight reduction perks mostly irrelevant. The tent needs to go away forever.
---
Ah damn. :(
---
On xbox, cancel within a month and get your money back. You keep the atoms, outfit and emotes
---
It’s easy to do solo with bloodied melee with a super fast swing weapon about half health, and a gun to blow up cars.  I use a shotty for that as shells are easy to stock up.  I do have a vampire mini gun that I tank the boss with which I am not spec’d for or I use it when I’m about to die.  Did it 4 times today with 4-6 minutes to spare. 
---
You can also keep trick or treating to build up the bar a lot faster.  I just walk up and down the pumpkins collecting on the 2nd and 3rd parts.
---
I do wear power armor to not die instantly in the last part though.
---
Good one...
---
Can you move it for free?
---
Aight so you dont get why people are complaining. Youre still a scab but as long as you get a mediocre Fallout game im sure you dont care. I dont see whats fun about a game completely devoid of NPC's just bots that attack on sight.  I dont know how that somehow becomes that shit to play but if you like it
---
Find a player in your recent list, and rejoin.
---
Yes.
---
Asshole if u killed the legendary before everyone else gets a shot. Period
---
Yes you do, it appears on the top left hand on the screen. It shows the persons gamertag and what they bought from your vendor, it appears for like a few seconds.
---
i find that the game has only gotten better with time, but the fanbase has clearly divided themselves.
---
what I will never understand is why people come here to post nothing but non-constructive BS and seemingly enjoy being miserable because they just keep coming here to post.
---
if I dont like a game, I stop playing and move on.  done it before, will do it again someday I am sure.  I certainly dont let it preoccupy me to the degree you seem to.  
---
so let me ask, why?  just move on if you hate it.
---
Wow, ok. I didn't realize, maybe that needs to be addressed too
---
A weird thing called being able to read, I imagine. It’s not private.
---
It was only just the two of us on his server. We took over 2 power plants, because I'm running power armor/heavy gun build, so I need a supply of fusion cores. Guess we'll have to retake the power plants.
---

---
So?
---
I'll try a reinstall.. Its just weird because rdo and bf5 are working no problem and it's the same account I brought fo76 on fml
---
I sell a couple a week. Of my standard apparel they are probably the best seller.
---
YES!  Man I've thought that same thing, seems so silly we can't do anything but look constipated.
---
You forgot Have a different opinion = asshole
---
If he restarts his fallout first sever within 20 minutes it should be the same one- I use this tactic to transfer stuff between characters. If you are Xbox I can load up my server for you if you need cores
---
When they add faction daily quests they should give double rewards if you wear the faction's uniform.
---
This. Can we collectively rename the company bEAthEAsdEA game studios? Its a bit of an eyesore, but really drives their new strategy home.
---
One thing I don’t get is as a blooded build I’m usually kinda low health with dips of almost dying during the event.  Last 4 times on same server I noticed as I’m getting hit I gain health like the vampire effect I have on my mini gun but I don’t use it as I need to preserve 5mm rounds as I don’t have many.  Not complaining but there where times I was almost dead with a sliver of health and I’m getting hit and I see my health climb with the hits lol.  I mainly notice it in the courtyard with all the robots shooting.
---
I missed the first day and when I finally played a round the xp counted for both the first and second unlocks.
---
For the Republic of China!!
---
The only thing the tent really lacks is the ability to scrap non-junk items. But otherwise you get access to your stash and the junk stash for free virtually anywhere. And because it is a free fast travel point too, the lack of other item scrapping is mostly null since you can slap it down, port back to your camp, then port back to the tent.
---
Considering our "private worlds" are just an instance on the normal servers, ya. There's already been cases of areas being cleaned out before a 1st player could get to it. It's not nearly as much privilege as it sounds like, first off. More importantly, it's only $13 a month. If your that envious, then buy it for yourself instead of whining about it.
---
Your logic is so  ass backwards it’s not even funny, this is single handedly the saddest shit I’ve ever read. Grow the fuck up you ass clown.
---
To increase performance all around, get a SSD. I bought a internal sandisk SSD from newegg for $99 and a encasement for it for a total of both at 109.99. Transferred the game to the SSD and its been pretty smooth playing. Loading doesn't take nearly as long now like for instance, if you fast traveled to a SBQ and the event was already mid fight, you'd have to load in then wait for all the enemies and players to load but with a SSD everything is already loaded in and you can see everything going on. This applies to all events and makes the game so much more manageable when things load in properly. I'm the first to move around in vault 51 when people are queuing up and I can get inside vault 94 so much faster than the HDD inside the xbo1x.
---
They truly are the scum of the industry, holy shit.
---
That's awesome! Yeah, time hasn't been very nice to Camden Park. The place seemed so much bigger and brighter when I went as a kid.  The pumpkin house is awesome, isn't it?
---
Don't worry, I'm sure that will get added as a new perk for Fallout 1st soon enough.
---
Thanks!
---
Thanks for the offer man - I'm on PC though!
---
Oh sorry, good luck then!
---
When you see the fallout first hate posters, please view their post history. The mentality is painfully obvious. 6 posts 3 years ago and then 400 plus posts in the last 12 months all bashing bes. That's borderline mental...
---
dont go into comedy for a living.. youll starve to death
---
Roota-toot-toot
---
BTW op, ty for the tips
---
Karma lol
---
What weapons are you using? I don't use damage perks and do a decent amount of damage. My AAE Prime Gatling Gun is my workhorse. Instigating Grognak's ax, AAE Prime LMG, and Executioners FFR Prime Plasma Gatling are in the rotation as well. The adrenaline perk card is great for when you are taking on mobs of enemies. I do use bobbleheads, magazines, food, and psychobuff to get damage bonuses.
---
Aha... So that's what happened to my post of bugs that I have found so far on the private servers eh? Ghosted?
---
Shall I post here also about being the only player on my server and lagging big time since the Halloween event went active? So much so that I won't even bother trying it again?
---
Found this [https://windowsreport.com/xbox-error-code-0x82d40003/](https://windowsreport.com/xbox-error-code-0x82d40003/)
---
The reinstall might fix it it looks like.
---
My wife and I both play and as of last night are at about a 50/50 success/crash ratio.   
---
I saw someone post earlier that changing the resolution may help - is there any truth to that? The event is a lot of fun up until the game just stops working.
---
Serums are absurdly common at this point as others have said.
---
It’s honestly really simple... the game obviously costs more to work on/maintain and make content for then  initially expected and if your not willing to support the game through elective funding (either through sub or atoms) so they can create and add new expansions and content... then fuck ya
---
&gt;I worked hard on this, please don't hate me.
---
There are more productive things you could have done with your time
---
No one cares. 
---
They just destroy the Sentry. One of the events, it didn't even have stars it was destroyed so fast. I've never seen it as a 3* in a public server, only private. I stand where it spawns, shaking my head no. It makes no difference. The event has been nuked 3 of the times I've ran it. Had to exit the zone, wait for the drop and go back in. One of those, time ran out. It's a super fun event, on a private server.
---
Noticed this too. Also if you go to ferment beer and your camp budget is maxed, it says workshop budget exceeded. You have to take something out like a magazine, then ferment. You can max out while the beer is in though.
---
I had never been there before, so I just kept driving down observatory road until I came to a small parking area. I couldn't drive past the gate, so I walked a little bit until I saw signs that said "no unauthorized equipment past this point." I took my pics from there. There were no fences. Some of the telescopes are not that far out. One of them is actually near the main building. I wish I could've gotten closer to the big one, though.
---
if i hated you i wouldnt be trying to give you potentially life saving advice..
---
also.. hating you and hating on you are not the same thing
---
This hurt my head.
---
&gt;So you're just a phoney. Got it. You dont actively play the game, you literally have no grounds of authority to discuss anything about it. Period.
---
If that's how you feel. Luckily for me, it's not up to you to decide that. lol
---
Also gotta love the irony of you talking about having authority as if *you* have any. Are you the opinion police or something?
---
&gt;What rules? Perhaps you can point out specifically in black and white those rules. I guarantee you cant.
---
No, I can't point to something that doesn't exist. There is no rule against attacking *anyone* at *any* time for *any* reason in the game. That's what I meant when I said rules of the game. If that wasn't clear earlier then it is clear now, so for the love of Todd don't start ANOTHER discussion about this now. I know you're tempted to, but don't. Give up.
---
&gt;because I guarantee that's not in the rules.
---
Like I said, there is nothing in the rules that say you can't gank low level players. Thus, it is in accordance to the rules of the game. And that is what I meant the whole time. If you honestly didn't understand that then I am truely worried about your comprehension skills. But I am 99.9% sure that you're only deliberately trying to misunderstand me now so you can continue arguing. So just stop. You can't win this argument.
---
&gt;And I take the risk saying that having never read the rules, nor played WoW.
---
Again, gotta love the irony here after having proclaimed authority on Fallout 76 a few sentences earlier.
---
Since I can't discuss anything about Fallout according to you, then maybe you should do the same and keep quiet about WoW? While you're at wikipedia, look up hypocrisy too.
---
&gt;You've given enough indication that you believe the developers designed the game this way all the while knowing people were going to specifically target 1st Subscribers.
---
No, that's not at all what I believe. There you go assuming things again.
---
&gt;The closest you can get to saying I'm attacking, insulting (insert what ever colourful word you decide) in this conversation, is that I lumped you in with the garbage players who want to go out of their way to make the game unplayable for others.
---
And talking about me wanting to target players in Fallout as revenge for having been bullied, which is a perfect example of ad hominem. Instead of arguing against what I was actually saying, you attacked me personally by arguing against my *motive*. A motive which I didn't even have. And thus you avoided genuine discussion of the subject by shifting the focus. Ad hominem in a nutshell.
---
Yes I copy pasted that last part from my previous post, since you ignored it completely. Think I'm just gonna start copy-pasting my text from now on as long as you keep going in circles, ignoring what I'm saying or deliberately misunderstanding it for the purpose of arguing.
---
Are we done?
---
Imagine shaming them for taking care of most paying customers. That's so fucking dumb dude.
---
Does making blueprints decrease CAMP budget?
---
But they can't, imagine them changing Fallout 1st, taking away the scrapbox or making the scrapbox available to anyone. There you go, another riot.
---
People who paid for this were promised that they paid for that tent, scrapbox, costume etc..
---
Making it available to all players in an upcoming patch would mean that they spent money for nothing. If bethesda adds new features to compensate, the community will demand those too.
---
The only way to avoid new outrage is to cancel Fallout 1st and refund all players, which will never happen, so don't expect anything to change.
---
Spontaneous jam sessions are one of my favorite things in this game.
---
I'm sorry you feel I wasted my time, but considering it's not your time I don't think you have the right to tell me what I could or couldn't have done with my time. seems rather hypocritical.
---
I'll let the 50 year old grandmothers who helped know they're the whitest of knights now lol
---
Ahh good. I was worried you did some off roading or walked off the paths. Be warned next time though they dont like you take pictures at the gate, they have a viewing platform a little ways past that they say is the limit for pictures. Unless your using a non digital camera, even taking a picture from the gate throws off there readings alot.
---
I don't know if it is always resources that draw people towards workshops. Some people like to build, and the workshops allow building outside of camp space limitations.   
---
I personally know two players who do that, and one of them has really enjoyed 1st for the privacy and peace it affords while building.
---
Adventure modes pvp is terrible cause of broken builds that kill any fun of a firefight
---
You can’t rejoin cause Bethesda sucks
---
Regardless, this post was satirical. Why would I go into comedy.
---
Bloodied FFR or Explosive Fixer
---
You too, fellow vault dweller!
---
So instead of uninstalling boycotting etc you are still supporting this company you say are fraudsters and ruining the game by continuing to play it and committing fraud yourself? You are also making it worse because guess what they will still count that as a Subscription and use those numbers to push more of this stuff.
---
"Someone told me to reread for better understanding.  Surely it couldn't be that I missed something obvious, no. I bet they're telling me this because they have a huge chip on their shoulder!"
---
Ladies and gentlemen, this is what we have to deal with today.
---
I am seriously loving these. I had zero desire to visit WV now I want to go!
---
Still tho there so many people complaining they keep getting attacked n stuff while i litreally never had anyone  tryna shot me or even claim my workshop do i have like a girl bonus or what xD
---
If Bethesda don't clean up their act *quick fast* I'm gonna boycott every future release of theirs.
---
I don't need TES 6 that badly, my hype for that ended ages ago, and they treat their player base like shit unless you give them more money.
---
I think that one of my friend just started doing NW challenges and he can see 3 challenges at 110xp. 1 sec let me ask him to take a screenshot.
---
Hey, so are you going to continue ignoring the 500 fucking posts about the Halloween event crashing?! This is your biggest problem you don't communicate for shit......
---
Maybe the mine dupe glitch. Someone probably littered the area with them cause they can.
---
I don't see the issue. Work benches are common.  Workshops can have benches and stash build. The only punishment for being over encumbered is to walk at normal speed.
---
Junk stash however is something that can not be replicated.  So an even limited version of it 100 to 150 lbs would be good.
---
I feel like people are actively looking for reasons to bash on Bethesda. I get that people hate the new subscription service but this is just nitpicking. What do you guys even want the Bethesda community managers to say?
---
That's awesome!!
---
Just go to every other one.
---
It only does this in your own camp. Someone visiting your camp or you visiting someone else's vendor will only see the items loaded into that particular machine.
---
Thank you
---
Good to know! I will keep that in mind because I definitely plan on going back for the tour someday. Thanks.
---
Thanks so much! Any positive interest that comes out of this for the state is worth it! More pics to come. :)
---
Robert Byrd can eat one but nice pics.
---
More likely is that they have no idea how to implement a decent anti-cheat in this engine and actually fixing it is a lot of time and resources for relatively little gain. And this is a game struggling to make money.
---
Their silence on the issue is pretty telling. They aren’t going to say they are “working on it” because they know it’s not going to get done.
---
If he can see three of them then that's already an upgrade over seeing one at a time for VTU, and if they all have exp then that's a confirmation.
---
Bruh, why?
---
Haha, thanks!
---
Hate the creator, love the art is an old saying that works here.
---
I bet they compensate us with 50-100 of each scrap and won’t give us any flux.
---
What a shit show
---
&gt;Let me tell you that my stash went from 800/800 to 320/800 lbs without the junk and i selled stuff that i was carrying in my mule and made 19k caps in less than 3hours selling crap weapons and armors that if wasnt the free space i got i wouldnt have space in my stash to sell it and it would be forgotten in my mule.
---
Congratulations. You understood what 99% of the morons defending this P2W crap have failed to grasp - the concept of having an *advantage* over other players by paying.
---
Yea it was pretty cool. It's beautiful there, especially this time of year.
---
Just don’t do it if you don’t enjoy it. 🤷‍♂️

I want that elite riot gear right now
---
Why would you have 400+ pounds of junk?
---
You aren’t acting in good faith. You are just as bad.
---
I just craft 5 of each, and drop them in the trunk.
---
I can argue against it because it's your opinion and it's not even a good one if you think Bethesda didn't work to improve the game. You're right though the game was launched in a state that it shouldn't have been but I don't agree with you that the game is not stable today because it most certainly is. The biggest issue now is them having to clean up the patches with hot fixes after release which is why a public test server is on the way. Sure they should have done this to begin with but they didn't however that won't take away from the fact that despite some of the flaws I've had a really good time playing the game and want it to continue to be developed. The facts being that online games cost money to maintain and since I don't want the game to fail because I enjoy it then I have to accept that's the nature of the beast. Trying to punish my favorite game company by allowing a game I enjoy to fail because a bunch of people on the internet thinks it will change the industry seems dilusional to me. 
---
All online games have subscription services like fallout 1! The model they are using is from ESO which doesn't have a bunch of trolls clogging up their subreddit complaining about it either. The only  difference being ESO started out as subscription only and then translated to this model while Fallout 76 added a subscription later.
---
 It's the hysteria of if all that annoys me. How this games has been flanked by trolls since before its release and still is. How the subreddit has thousands of people who only follow it so they can shit on the game and how people try to tell me I an destroying the industry because I pay money for a game I enjoy? That's capitalism in a nut shell isn't it? If you are so concerned about ethics of it all why not concentrate on something with a bit more purpose than shitting on a product that some people enjoy because there are certainly way better examples of people being ripped off than Bethesda's online game and the fantasy of Todd Howard being Satan himself.
---
 It's a video game that they are asking for 13 dollars a month for. It's not going to throw people out on the streets or put people in bankruptcy. If anything it's going to do the opposite. It's going to allow people to have a job developing a game I enjoy. If you don't enjoy it then fine don't buy it but can you please stop clogging up the forum and shitting on those who do? It's fucking 13 dollars!
---
Because you have to do every single one you can if you want a shred of hope of getting the 1 prize you really want.
---
With all the bitching that’s going on I don’t blame them for it
---
You're the fucking hypocrite you blind motherfucker.
---
Main issue is that most of the stuff is done client side and just tweaking some numbers allow you to do million damage per shot 5000 rounds per minute and all the horrible things. It ain't about anti cheats cause you can do all that with no cheat engine getting involved.
---
?????????????????? LOL REALLY?
---
Happened numerous times to me. Take the workshop at the abandoned munitions factory and see how long you last.
---
What difference does it make *why*?
---
Cause I don't have all the stuff
---
I wouldn’t wanna talk to you guys either tbh
---
It's upstairs in the science lab.
---
It does say in the fine print of the creation club that anything created in it belongs to Bethesda, basically.
---
Sell a AAA game and don't provide any support for your customers see what happens. Oh wait, I guess we know that now.
---
Yeah most of the pvp focused players are in nuclear winter so that’s probably why
---
If this is true this makes fo76 worth playing again by also subscribing to fo1st
---
Well that's not very nice. Why all the hostility? I didn't personally attack you, did I? If so you have my apologies.
---
Agree with all except nuclear winter is probably my fav thing to do in the game right now. It's good pvp
---
Ah im just an asshole, I'm sorry. That was uncalled for
---
Nah, just makes it so you can put them down quicker. Or duplicate structures if desired. Can also make setting up Workshops easier.

---
I found this by accident. Collect from a plant/fruit then scrap the plant/fruit. It adds a single copy of item into your scrapbox rather than stash.
---
Because why would you have such an hilariously unnecessary amount and then cry foul about other people have an advantage?
---
It messes up with things I want to add and what not. Since I have them all sorted out
---
No one says they didn't work to improve things. And no, it isn't an opinion. Factually speaking, it is unethical. I'm done with this discussion, you're clearly just biased for Bethesda. Meanwhile, I legitimately want to see them succeed. And I'm not shitting on those making the game at all. I'm shitting on the higher ups. The ones making the decisions. Which I made clear in my previous post.
---
Bethesda, as in the developers Bethesda, are likely just doing their jobs as they're told. ZeniMax on the other hand is pushing their agenda.
---
And never did I say I didn't enjoy the game either. I said, they are taking a very unethical business practice. Which, is 100% true. They are. They, being the ones who make these decisions. You're literally trying to defend the game, when the game isn't even what's under attack.
---
Actually read what you're responding against, before you respond. Hell, you're also trying to defend Fallout 1st. I said SEVERAL times, Fallout 1st isn't inherently an issue. It's the principle of the matter, and other underlying things. Solve those underlying issues? Fallout 1st becomes fine.
---
Yeah but why play that when I can play Hunt: Showdown, PUBG, or any of the other decent BR.  I honestly don't think the perk system, nor the guns are balanced well for NW.  That's just my opinion though.
---
As long as you're having fun with it though, don't let me stop you. :)
---
One small saving grace in quite a mess of a game.
---
You have been blessed by Todd
---
i did not run it tonight and probably wont, its  way past my bedtime and i have 2 more raids to run
---
They added filters. Hit triangle (or whatever the other system equivalent is) to cycle through them. One of them should just show what's in that machine.

Scrap food? Wut?

So you're saying you checked very Fallout post they replied to today and each and evey post the person claimed to be a Fallout 1st subscriber?
---
Depends on your perk set up. 
---
Choose BE if:
---
Don’t like farming ammo
---
If you use Demolition expert
---
Don’t mind that extra lag
---
Some mobs negate explosive damage 
---
Use less ammo but less DPS
---
Choose BFFR if:
---
You value damage over anything
---
Don’t mind farming ammo.
---
To be honest both will be fine, I have both and to buy it was a pain. it’s gonna game at least a legacy and around 10-15k or a few god weapons. You’re not going to get FR, sorry but unless you have top premium stuff. Good luck
---
I don't understand the question or its relevance. You don't think having the ability to store more items than other players is an advantage?
---
Why do you carry around so much junk? Is this why people are crying about more stash limits? Wtf?
---
This. While I think that should be the default view, this is another example of *‘not looking at the on-screen prompts that tell you what each button does in that particular contextual situation’.*
---
Not true:

Plus they've been very silent since the 1st launch. Other than to answer questions on Tuesday about when the event was going to start, there has been nothing else said by Bethesda on any of the forums. This was a severe issue for people who had paid at least $15 in the past week. Of course they are going to jump right on that as it is 100% preventing people from using any of what they purchased. All other bugs in the game are inconveniences (granted, some major) but are not preventing total usage of what was bought like today's issue did.

Lol this is just gonna make the krill army even more mad about FO1st (unless that’s what you meant anyway)😂

Sure, make it daily, because everyone in the world is on the same schedule and we all share the same time zone...
---
Btw this is just a suggestion. I’m level 53 so I guess I don’t see respecing the same a more experienced players
---
His point is all RNGs have a seed.  
---
The OPs point was poorly stated if you are looking at it from a technical perspective.  IF fo76 is seeding the RNG with an account number that's a bad choice.  There are better ways on modern CPUs (all the CPUs the game runs on) to give you a better seed.  That seed wouldn't be constant over time and would vary each time the game was (started)/(the RNG is called).  This would be a much more fair way to approach it, UNLESS, it was a design decision by Bethesda to have some characters be more lucky than others (which could be an interesting take, 'hey your character is just unlucky, we're sorry, but life has dealt you this hand'.)  But if they did that it would be nice for them to acknowledge it and then try to counter balance it in someway since (unlike previous fallouts) 76 has pvp.
---
That wouldn't be true though would it. Considering much poorer companies managed without micro transactions and a subscription. It just doesn't make any business sense to fix or create much content for if the player base is paying out already. There's no need. Zenimax most likely won't give them the funding due to that. So yea fuck ya
---
You paid for a game with 3 future dlc included in the price, and a road map of when to expect what you paid for. 
---
When your house was built, would you accept delays for the work you had already paid for because the construction company decided to spend their time on a more profitable project instead? That's what fallout first is.
---
Wahhh, someone launched a nuke in a game about launching nukes!?!
---
Just fucking server hop if you're that butthurt about it. Or launch your own. Either way, stop being a whiny bitch about it.
---
Cringe
---
I have fun playing fo76, but only when all my walls connect together properly~
---
Nah you’re right. He could’ve been doing anything else but instead probably spent 5-10 minutes concocting &amp; typing out this salt ridden message.. just trying to enjoy a sub without the krill army fighting their shrimp battles 😂
---
The problem is you seriously lack the ability to manage your stash. If you feel overburdened, don't pick the shit up
---
Whaaat?
---
That's all well and good, but I never would have thought to try that because A: That's not how it used to work, so it comes across like a bug and B: Because of this, I wouldn't think to try filtering it.
---
Wow, I finally was able to get on to try one of these and I got the Pirate Costume.  Any ideas of value atm?
---
Dailies are soloable in case you hadn't noticed
---
Stop warning them. I need my peons farming for me. Let them lose they shit.

Yeah I took them all for the atoms... But only ever took hemlock, and the dump until I'd unlocked all the plans.

That seems to be the one everyone wants the most. Until the event is over, you're not gonna be able to tell value. If everyone that wants it gets it, it will be worth a lot less and won't see a value increase until months from now.
---
I feel like someone else said it best last week, I don’t remember the user or exact quote. They basically said Bethesda didn’t make a great Fallout RPG, but they made a great Fallout MMO. I haven’t played since about six months after launch (we moved, and the only internet we can get is satellite, which doesn’t support online gaming), but when I did, it was fun. 
---
A good example: my buddy (level 60 something) and I (20 something) were in Whitesprings, and he got killed by a random level 80 something creature (can’t remember the name, looks like a scorpion/spider with crystals growing out the back)  and left me on top (not gonna lie, I was hiding like a little bitch lol) of a roof barely alive. Out of nowhere, a level 100ish player in power armor comes up, gets the creature’s health down to almost nil, then stops shooting it but stays close enough to keep its attention off of me, letting me get the kill. After I came down, he dropped a couple of weapons that were right at and above my level, and a bunch of health stuff. You can’t beat that feeling in a game when a random stranger shows up, saves your ass, and then helps even further. 
---
I get the hate, in a way. Bethesda is doing (almost) everything right, IF THIS WERE AN MMO. It is, but it was always advertised and expected to be an traditional RPG, except with friends. Plus, everyone knows that Bethesda games are buggy, it’s par for the course at this point. Let’s be fair to them, though. They’re a small (relative to the amount of gamers) team that is developing a huge world, story, and everything that goes with that. Sure, they could and should do better. But they do (at least the developers) deserve SOME leniency. 
---
TL;DR it’s a great (mostly) community; it’s a good MMO, but a poor Fallout with friends RPG; bugs are expected with Bethesda games; give the developers some leniency, because of the massive amount of work that goes into it along with the limited time/scope they have to test it.
---
Some of them are 1st members.  They are 1st class wasteland citizens.  They can do no wrong.
---
They should give the poor buggers who had their scrap deleted 500 of everything, that should cover it.
---
Go into your camp...floor decor. There are 2 places where you have pumpkins. One is the atom store ones that are lit up, the other are the Mischief Night rewards. You need to have pumpkins in your inventory or you won't be able to craft it and it will look like you haven't unlocked it. Also note that there's a bug where when you lean a jack o lantern plan, it will always say 'classic' in the pop up at the upper left. But they all still craft correctly.
---
Go to [nukesdragons.com](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) and you will see all the perks available to you. There are loads of example builds using this site, and you can compare them there without having to test them out for yourself. 
---
Having the right Perks to suit the armor and weapons you use is very important. Stick to one type of weapon, don't try to mix and match between different classes of weapon (eg. heavy weapons and rifles) as it will weaken the damage you can output. This is what I did at first, because of the weapon drops I got when I started farming Whitesprings. Bad idea.
---
Unless you want to go for a Power Armor and Heavy Guns, or Power Armor and Melee build, you can use Sneak to double the damage you do when hidden or in caution. All builds are fun to try but it's amazing how quick you can kill a bunch of enemies (eg. supermutants at West Tek or around Watoga) with a Sneak / VATS Commando build and an automatic rifle with a suppressor.
---
Using Unyielding armor you can boost your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats up *enough* to keep you from being seen/heard directly by nearby enemies, and to have the Action Points (which come from high *Agility*) needed to kill the enemy and line up the next one with plenty to spare, along with the Accuracy (which is dependant on *Perception*) needed to get a headshot at medium range (eg. 50-100ft). You'll need to have around or below 40% health to do this (so it can be risky) but most times nothing gets close enough to see you never mind kill you. 
---
Doing this in groups with players nearby to you using loud/heavy gunfire may cause problems with sneak though, but you can always back away and hope the Escape Artist perk kicks in quickly enough to keep you safe (ie. from *danger* back to *caution*). Most players also have the Marsupial mutation (and the Starched Genes Perk at 2) so you can also jump upwards to avoid getting hit, and then fire down below you if you have enough time. For a weapon you could use an automatic Combat Rifle (good), Handmade (best) or even Assault Rifle (ok) as your main weapon. A Bloodied 1\* version (or maybe even a 1\* Anti-Armor) would work well enough unless you get mobbed by multiple Mirelurk Kings, Radscorpians or Scorchbeasts (but not at the same time!) in the Cranberry Bog, and the better your weapon is the less bullets you use. You can use Psychostats too. If you're on PC I have some of each I could sell you for a decent low price ;)
---
The real arsehole is Bethesda not lifting a finger to prevent this. Of course people are going to nuke the event because they can and ruin the experience for those that just want to do the event.
---
We really should be pushing Bethesda to fix this, not shame the players for doing so. 
---
Or both but more of the pushing Bethesda to fix the issue.
---
u/meatgoat36
---
Ok boomer
---
I'll buy shit when there is shit worth buying &amp; at comfortable price. Not a cheapskate, but also not going to be an idiot with my dough.
---
I'm not talking about their expansions. They have regular content every year called the Living World, and it's all free.
---
Good job...  
---
I'm not happy with how silent they've been on a number of issues, but we have to be honest with ourselves if we expect them to be.
---
I mean...you basically covered a 40 year span in your demographics, so I’d hope that’s most of the people you hear lol
---
Agreed on the talking, though. Sure, in Fallout, there’s really no long distance communications, and you wouldn’t hear the guy on the other side of that wall normally. That’s so minor to me it has no effect on immersion. But, to each their own, ya know?
---
Fertilizer, toilet paper, "you have been insulted" note
---
Hahah I had that spawn glitch happen on sheep squat imposter, I died right before the other folks took the last sliver of health off it.  I missed out on the loot lol
---
Same here. I was wondering what happened to it.
---
My roommate plays destiny 2 and my jealousy of his emotes is intense
---
I’m pretty sure the +50% limb damage only goes towards crippling limbs. Not actually increased health damage when you hit a limb.
---
Embarrassing.
---

I am also on PS4 and had the same thing happening to me an hour or two ago.  I played it last night for a few hours and everything was working great.  Tried to load it up this evening and it crashed about 5-6 times right at the start screen (after hitting 'any' button - blue screen with same error as you) .  What sad is that I was only just getting into the game - I only have 24 hours of playtime into it, level 15 or 16 on my first character.  I guess that's all I get out of this game...  for now or maybe ever.  (Depends on if they fix whatever the bug is - my guess is that it's server related because that's the only thing that's changed since last night - no updates to PS4 or FO76 have been made).
---
Who has time to try to debug / troubleshoot this type of thing?  I had a horrible time getting it installed fresh out of the shrink-wrap but I gave it a shot and actually found it pretty fun and the world was great to explore.  I wonder if it will be fixed in a few months, or if this shiny new disc is just a coaster now.
---
Have fun on borderlands / outer worlds!  Life's too short to waste time on always crashing buggy games.
---
He’s landed quite a few headshots on me as I’ve been sprinting across the map. Hits it every time.
---
No we won't stop.
---
Oof... even worse. Not sure how I can make the best of this weapon then. Why couldn’t I just get blessed with a FFFR or a FE version😪
---
Jokes on you for expecting something to happen
---
What a guy. My entire squad in full marine lost to him before I posted this. Dudes practically a legend now.
---
So there’s stuff I want to stick up on for biv dailies or just making alcohol in general. Or other cooking. I’m gonna try this tonight. Can you imagine it it worked for meet? That would be bad.
---
Headshots with limb damage affect accuracy. Mutants yell out "my head!".
---
Sigh.
---
Smh
---
LOL, that’s cool. I wish it gave me headshot damage at least :-/ not sure I’ll be able to make due with this weapon. My first fixer is looking like more scrip😪
---
You sound like the type of person who actually believes Bethesda when they say they ran out of canvas.
---
Yeah I run that perk in my PvP build and it's amazing!
---
Ok Im going to test this out. If this is true, guess who is going to go farming for a few hours?
---
Yep. Better start collecting.
---
It is getting really bad . There used to be maybe 10 known cheaters but now its 4-6 per match . I really really loved this mode . It was balanced ,fun and exciting but now .... it is literally impossible to play .
---
Btw ,recently i am seeing 6-8 people grouping together until everyone else is dead and only then they start fighting each other... that is also not fair . 
---
This whole mode is out of hand at this point.
---
And delay their entire 2020 lineup. But they deserve it.
---
I like limb damage on rifles. Take out ghouls legs or other melee enemies and you are pretty safe. It's not useless imo
---
This is just flat out not true
---
Except your maths doesn't add up. You would have to assume that either nobody else other than these theoretical alts has voted a comment, or that for some inexplicable reason these alts are trying to maintain karma on these posts at an arbitrary value.
---
Basically, it's more likely that roughly the same number of other redditors went through voting up the comments of their side and downvoting the other.
---
*1st player problems*
---
&gt;Ok boomer
---
That's the best you can come up with? That's fucking sad.
---
&gt;A Vaul-Tek business suit that looks like it was worn by Matthew Lesko IV. 
---
It's perfect for my sleazy scrap dealer! Which is guess is proving your point since that's an edge case.
---
&gt;But a Brotherhood of Steel wall decal? An Enclave poster? 
---
I would be super irked about that - Just like I was about a lot of the Freestates/Raider stuff.
---
IMHO, because the atom store is so damn costly, I don't want to see anything for sale that my character can reasonably fine out in the world. Trying to sell me a freestates flag in the atom store when my character could have/should have been able to take one of the ones laying about in the world, just feels money-grabby to me.
---
I would argue a better approach is ruined/broken versions of almost anything found in the world, with pristine/new/improved ones in the atom shop.
---
I suppose. I’ll try it out i guess. I’ll just be locking in to legs in VATS instead of head! Furious should help pick up in damage I suppose with the more damage each consecutive shot even though I’ve tested it &amp; it feels sooo weak. Thanks for the info!
---
I don’t typically harass people on the internet so, sorry. Tried my best.
---
Also, what does being a boomer (which I'm not) have to do with you being a fucking whiny bitch?
---
You have them all fresh out of the vault.
---
You’re being a whiny asshole about an opinion I shared.
---
You can keep calling me a whiny bitch, it doesn’t make you look any better.
---
You are correct, but anyone mentioning mmogfails and those leaks got voted into oblivion. I wonder what that means....
---
It's good enough for me to just shoot him several times before getting 2nd lol
---
Take over workshops and mos definitely take advantage of the special events. Lots of xp to be handed  simply by tagging all the enemies
---
I have an anti armor/limb damage lever that is a lot of fun in vats. Not my strongest rifle but a good workhorse for run of the mill enemies.  Try a few leg shots to slow things down then snap back to the head. It should pair nicely with furious. I wouldn't scrip it if I owned it!
---
If you want you could buy a virtual canvas bag sorry I mean nylon
---
How many people who paid the $100 will even be playing in a year? Will the game even be getting content updates then? I highly doubt it. Monetization of games has gone way too fucking far.
---
I don't hate you. Still didn't stop me from downvoting though.
---
woosh
---
I still can't believe so many people are paying for this service. It really does break my heart. I've uninstalled the game yesterday and there is little chance of me coming back until wastelanders or this class war is resolved by Bethesda themselves. 
---
I'll still be on this sub though to check out the latest news, or new reasons to hate Bethesda since that seems to be the trend for most.
---
I bet you get downvoted hard. Anyone else mentioning that site does.
---
They fixed the old sound looping bug. This is a new sound looping bug introduced by the fix for the old sound looping bug.
---
Someone died during the event and everyone kept trying to revive them, which wasted everyone's stimpaks and alcohol. That was at the start of the event. I went back to the first bonfire and they were still there dead, waiting to be revived... 
---
My friend died shortly after this and couldn't respawn. Which was fine. We ended up logging off shortly afterwards anyway for something else. Still, if we wanted to play Fallout after that, we wouldn't be able to because she tried to restart the game first and that still didn't fix it. I hope she didn't lose her character.
---
I feel ya. I still try to hit square to get into the stash. Muscle memory is a hard thing to overcome.
---
Not till they have fixed all bugs gotten rid of fallout 1st and are offer 1k or more free atom to players.
---
Why repost. It didn't get traction then. Why are you expecting it would now?
---
I paid for a month of fallout 1st so I could get a break from the pvp, not necessarily escape it altogether. It just gets a little frustrating trying to complete quests or explore on my low level characters when all of the enemies I run into are 3x my level due to being placed on a server with players over level 300 
---
But that’s a problem in itself, I guess
---
It's because they are cowards.
---
No way man, the escalation of monetization is because zenimax’s creditors came knocking.
---
I explain that in a few different ways for my different characters. For example one character is "Carol". Carol thinks she's the best secretary in the world and that's what got her qualified for the vault, she's the best!
---
 In reality she's just the secretary of a corrupt VIP that used his influence to get her placed in the vault. One of my other characters is a war criminal, another is a trader that  paid for his spot, and my last character is an engineer that actually deserved to get in the vault
---
LOL
---
Well I don't even own or play the game, so I don't have any problem at all. It was OP who said they were stashing junk. Why don't you try direct your question at them instead? If you think it's relevant.
---
I’m really not surprised people believe this kind of bullshit post.   Sad.
---
The Fastnacht masks look good in power armor.
---
Who hurt you?
---
It's not because the foodbuilds in pacifist don't pvp lol
---
you right same with scrap kits kill someone take their stuff scrap kit it away and now killing you doesn't let them get their junk back.
---
They straight up bounced you back dawg 😂.
---
Yeah I can tell you don't play. You seem to have no idea about the game
---
Whitesprings
---
Join Public events
---
Take over workshops
---
Don't be shy, join a team and do team things.
---
I'm not expecting anything, in fact I feel like I have the most reasonable solution and I'm shouting into the abyss. It seems like no ones wants to discuss ways to fix the issues, they just want to talk about how bad they are.
---
It takes 5 minutes to do with a team 8-10 by yourself..
---
Shills are out in force I see.
---
The people who bought 1st got a box to store all of the " unnecessary" amount of junk the could ever imagine. So they still clearly have an advantage when it comes to maximizing vendorbots and regular stash.
---
So you're complaining about something in a game you haven't even played. Interesting.
---
The bugs come mostly because Obsidian isn't/wasn't a very good developer and they were trying to build a much larger game than they had time for, which is just poor planning on their part.
---
That same engine worked just fine for Fallout 3.
---
lol
---
The last challenge will be unlocked November 3rd and you have until November 12th to complete as many as you can.
---
"This game where you collect shit, have guns, build bases, and can compete over resources, or kill others for no reason, isn't the same as this other game exactly like that"
---
"People playing the game the way it was meant to be played, but I'm the one losing, means they are 'fucking manchildren and have serious social issues."
---
Rofl. Grow up. It's only childish or toxic because you're the one losing.
---
So why are you giving my advice on how to manage my stash? If you can tell I'm not playing?
---
Not really given the threshold of how many items are needed is far less then that.   It is a QoL update but not an advantage.  Because frankly you don't need 60% of your stash to be filled with junk. That is way way to much.
---
And either my net is messing up, psn is messing up or the Halloween even is straining the servers. But since the scrap stash I have noticed servers seem less responsive then before.
---
Not sure if they changed anything but I know that those large containers have been there since the beginning.
---
I've seen 880 on xbox. Of course that is not natural. Its like the difference between a person on steroids and not
---
Never said I haven't played it.
---
You can easily max out a vendor caps just by cooking and selling meat you pick up.
---
“We were wrong to release a much requested service behind a paywall, instead we’re re-tuning fallout 1st to only offer private servers, atoms monthly and exclusive atom shop discounts for 1st members, the scrap box/tent will be free for everyone as will all future DLC.”
---
^ This would be a great start.
---
Daily reminder that a 10 second delay between attacking a  claimed workshop and pvp engagement would be a massive quality of life improvement for everyone.
---
10 seconds won't stop anyone from claiming a workshop that they want to claim, it just prevents one-sided instant claim and shoot tactics. You should have time to exit the workbench you are using and fast travel away if you don't want to defend the workshop.
---
Currently, opening the build menu, using a workbench, or anything except actively keeping your gun pointed at the head of everyone near your workshop means you are just asking to get ganked.
---
Life in general. If you can't handle it, leave it be
---
Wow no kidding I lost my first game of NW to him.  I thought he was just good
---
I just want this event to be over so I can stop playing this piece of shit game for a long time even NW crashed on me today
---
There’s PvP in fallout? lol
---
Or you could just go to whitespring and shoot the sentry bots, they even drop 2 cores if you loot them before and after they explode.
---
The majority of players do not go to CAMPs for meat, they're buying equipment, ammo, plans. Equipment obviously taking up most space of the inventory space.
---
&gt;I'm not expecting anything
---
That's laughably false. 
---
You're expecting discussion of your idea. Maybe that it picks up some steam.
---
You're also expecting attention. Otherwise why even mention it feels like shouting into the abyss? 
---
You should try to be honest with yourself &amp; see the situation for what it is, not what you'd like it to be.
---
I guess I just never noticed them before. That's amazing, it's been a year lol. But something there feels totally different for some reason. Maybe it's just me?
---
I wouldn't say it's worse. I love my instigating hunting rifle with limb damage, can cripple most and least legs in the first shot.
---
Just to clarify you're on about base turrets?
---
If yes then yes they always have, I've come back from exploring and looted corpses that have been killed when I come back to base
---
Can confirm your assumption is correct. So does not accumulate towards challenges not yet unlocked but previous days challenges are not replaced. Live in same time zone as Bethesda and new challenges are released after 8pm est each day. So best to wait until all are unlocked and accumulate towards all challenges. As I unlocked two today before 8 and had to await next challenge. Previous xp did not count when new challenge was added so another 1500 is now required for 3rd challenge. Again best to wait until are are available and then begin work.
---
If you need fusion cores just kill the whitespring sentry bots
---
Many players are okay with it. It's just that someone against fallout 1st is incredibly loud especially in this subreddit. About half of them don't even play no shit
---
Because the tent has the junk stash. and it scraps the junk too, so like i said, it negates the point of most weight reduction perks. If they removed the junk stash from the tent, then sure, that would be much better.
---
U just noticed today.
---
This had been normal
---
Not really you say, followed by indirectly admitting that it depends on your playstyle. For example if two players were collecting junk and one of them has a Fallout 1st subscription, that player would obviously have an advantage over the other one.
---
Also, what about being able to stash your junk right before PVP? (with the tent). Meaning you won't drop the junk if you die. That's not an advantage either?
---
Cool, thanks for the info man! I’ll make a post on market to get someone to mod it out for me! Any suggestions on mods? If you know them I’ve never actually used a combat rifle so not sure what mods this gun even has... I need automatic though as I’m a commando build
---
My PC ran it fine. Frames dropped a little but were still good. FX 8350 @ 4.1ghz, 16GB RAM, GTX 1070ti and installed on a SSD
---
SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! &gt;!honestly don't know if there is a difference since I am a first player!&lt;  
---
Also in no way at all is there any abusable bugs that can net large returns and some interesting extras in a private world.
---
Really
---
Yeah someone else commented giving me the same tips. Nice I’m gonna get someone from market76 to mod it up for me &amp; test it out!
---
That is meshing
---
So you've either sold your copy or played a friend's copy?
---
people thinking wastelanders is going to cost money is really a thing?
---
You could just not PvP till you store it
---
That makes no sense at all but okay.
---
Yes, but I might be confused.  Workshop turrets definitely don't but I was sure base turrets didn't either.   Ok thanks.  All good.
---
Im just on my toes because of fallout 1st thats all
---
I used to have a chatpad on my 360 controller and the was fantastic for it. Made the controller nice and chunky too. It's been ages since I've seen one, though
---
limb damage is ok because headshots screw with ppl’s vision
---
Thanks bro !
---
So I understand.   Lol.  My confusion.
---
everybody does :D
---
I picked up tons of combat rifles for scrap so i learned most of them long before I got a fixer and before they got added to the legendary pool. Definitely want a suppressor to maximize sneak damage. Armor piercing mag is good too. Stay away from scopes for better vats.
---
Let's do coffee.  Lol
---
Gee what a surprise. Bethesda screwed something again.
---
Just noticed this tonight, it threw me off.  WTF is there armor in my weapons ve--  ohhhhhh.    
---
Not a fan at all.  Any idea why Beth did this?  Makes it a lot more difficult to sort stuff and know what's where in my vendors.
---
Nope. Had it refunded.
---
Yup.
---
Maybe  don’t do the event, if you don’t like it? It’s that simple tbh.
---
Couldn't have played for long then
---
You should take a look at that sad sacks other posts. It paints a sad picture.
---
We're doing copy pasta now?
---
some people temporarly lost access to their fallout 1st (1 hour or so) and we in our discord suspect that has been a DDos on Bethesda today
---
might have happened, might have had something to do with it. not sure i doubt we will ever know
---
because they dont tell us anything anywhere anymore /rant
---
I agree, some cats like playing multiplayer. Scrap box and tent should be for everyone. Or just cut the tent all together. Scrap box should be free. I bought month of first, don't use either of these. Just wanted the suit and atoms
---
Lul you'll thank me later
---
They said all dlc is free. We're good.
---
11th time.
---
Yeah but thay also said cosmetic only but look at the game now
---
Don't listen to that shill, yes it is p2w. I personally always place a tent when I see a mob and put my junk away. If I die? I pick my tent to respawn at so I dont waste caps and Im already at the enemy. Literally just canon fodder
---
It's good for roleplay or looking chill when you go afk
---
Honestly, the event imo is pretty mid and so are the rewards for completing it but yeah, it usually gets really laggy due to the amount of activity for me. Haven't had a disconnect though, at some moments it did seem like it would due to freezing up
---
[Hey Noobmaster, It’s Thor again,](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qcFipN1dhC4) You know, the god of thunder? Listen buddy, if you don’t log off this game immediately I will fly over to your house, and come down to that basement your hiding in and rip off your arms. Oh, that’s right, yea just go cry to your father you little weasel.
---
Long enough to make the conclusion that it was utter bollocks.

If they charge for dlc they are done for. They took the chance for cosmetics, but wastelands is their last hope. Trust me, we're good.
---
&gt;Please take a stand protest walk out, do something! 
---
That's very easy for you to say. You livelihood &amp; career in the gaming industry aren't on the line.
---
Maybe try and lead by example &amp; inspire others to do the same. Making a post here badgering other people who have more at stake to lose isn't it.
---
Yeah well, not every game is for everyone
---
I hope so
---
Honestly, That sounds like a bug
---
Actually I had already forgotten about it until you replied again now.
---
Hes the governments lead scientist on rejection and inferiority complexes.
---
My phone doesn't inject advertisements, only the aps that I chose to use for free under condition that I see ads do.
---
I don't think you're as smart as you think you are. Quit while you're only a little behind maybe?
---
They do listen to their fanbase. Just very selectively so.
---
I fear that the Bethesda you're hoping for just doesn't exist any more.
---
Happy for them to prove but they really haven't.
---
u/ladydevann
---
Yeah I hate scopes in this game (Nuclear Winter ruined them for me lol)
---
I've been playing since FO1 and the game has really helped me through some bad times.
---
It's now kinda like watching your loved one slowly waste away to a long term illness and you're just waiting on the inevitable end.
---
I'm sad now :(
---
sweet! thanks for heads up.
---
i'm looking forward to it. :}
---
This isn't worst as in mean but worst as in tasteless.
---
On the top floor of my base there is a lightpole with a chair in front of it and a sign "take a seat."
---
The stairs leading up to the top floor have a marquee arrow and in neon the words in neon "LIVE NUDES."
---
I showed a visitor to my camp the sign then got him upstairs sitting in the seat took off all my armor and clothing and made it look like I was poke dancing while wearing a fedora.
---
Why is this NSFW?

“M-Morty... we NEED that REDDIT KARMA Morty... We need as much of it as we can carry... We need that sweet sweet Reddit Gold...”
---
No problems at all. This bug i think is similar to the camp building one where for instance when Im in build mode only my 'right movement' key (H) works. Makes building slow. i.e. change your keys and the default unchangable ones break. Been this way aince launch and is also found in FO4.
---
Back to your original question- it comes from MMO play and Im way to used to it now. Its all about hand positioning, reaction time, and key availability.
---
In MMOs theres usually about 50+ hotkey buttons required. Having TFGH gives me alot more keys that are closer to my fingers as opposed to WASD. I.e. WASD stops past TAB, caps, shift, etc.
---
Also it places your hand closer to the other side of the KB, allowing easier and faster reach to these keys, and in the case of Fallout, places my hand in the middle of the hotkeys (from the wheel). 
---
All in all it saves time, which in PVP (pve less so but still obvs helps) can mean winning or losing concluded by micro seconds that you may have shaved.
---
Ok, now you are just being aloof. We all know that we paid for the game, I personally don't want anything extra,  I want a fixed game. The one I put in helped tickets for with the Beta, and still having issues with it. But yes, by all means, tell me why I need to pay for more of nothing when we were told we would never have to pay for anything other than cosmetics.They are using a F2P model on a game that we ALL paid for. And now you are asking for more without fixing the other issues?? That's why I'm heartbroken and yes I truly am heartbroken over this. 
---
And please, don't treat me like some bum who can't pay or doesn't know how a business works. Assume I know and assume I make enough to pay for it. It's not your issue, I realize that, just don't think that people are just upset about the cost or wanting more.
---
They did listen to their fan base....also known as shareholders.
---
Privately held companies don't have shareholders.
---
Why do you think so many people set up turret bases behind the golf club for all those months?  It's wasn't to deny people kills, it was to farm the ghouls.
---
Do u have fallout 1st?
---
No?
---
This.
---
Satire doesn't have to be funny.
---
With all the explosions and the frame rate of 1, I am lucky if I can manage to shoot anything at all.  I would have no way of knowing if I were in the right area or not.
---
You are a moron if you think ESO sub is fairer. Let me break it down to you because for some reasons you played that game for "1600" and are still absolutely clueless. 
---
ESo sub gives you infinite crafting mats space while without a sub, you start of with extremely limited inventory space -literally like a 100 items you can carry and the moment you loot crafting, it will be full almost instantly. Eso sub also gives you double bank space. 
---
But this doesnt end here, it gived you free cash shop currency which outright let you upgrade shits like mount speed/stam/INVENTORY. 
---
You also make outright 10% more GOLD and exp and your crafting levels up faster, which translates to leas grind.
---
You have DOUBLE transmutation which is the key ingredient for end-game BIS gear. 
---
But if that's not enough, literal DOZENS of dungeons/trials/maps are locked behind the same paywall. So..
---
r/quityourbullshit
---
What platform are you on? Not that it makes s difference in the quality of player but I know people on all three that are good decent folk who would never run by you. If you want, PM me your platform and IGN and I'll have someone contact you. We don't leave a man behind. Ever.
---
Yes but they have investors... which essentially serve the exact same purpose as shareholders. Dumbass
---
All right pal. Enjoy your goblin porn.
---
PC is master race
---
i think there's something a bit off ... I just ran the event again and killed a FOUR star wolf that gave me a one star weapon (Furious pistol I think) anyway  ...it was a 4 star! Pretty sure that doesn't exist
---
Lol. I was at 4 and now I'm at -3. So yeah. Seems that way. Oh well, if I get downvoted for speaking the truth, those that downvoted me can go f themselves.
---
they killed me three times today
---
And here we go with the "It's my money" excuse. Look, I'm sorry you're in this situation, you paid for something  and it clearly isn't working right. I will not be one of those people that says "serves you right" but you got to understand. 
---
Sure you can spend your money any way you like, nothing should stop you. but the problem is that you run the chance of ruining the experience for all of us if you buy 1st which is essentially a vote of support toward it (For Bethesda's eyes at least, I know many players are getting it for one month only and canceling because it's a crappy service and they just want the outfit or something).
---
This isn't relevant to your support at all but I hope the situation is resolved and you don't stay subbed for too long.
---
I noticed this today. Its if you scrap planted food from your workshop.
---
yeah at this point i’ve had enough too, if I was Bethesda I would just ignore all the haters, its only a small amount if their population and nothing they do will please these people, if they gave then the world they would chastise them and ask for the universe.  it’s also worth considering the majority of these negative posts are hired goons from competing gaming studios who can’t hold a candle the the fallout universe and have no other choice than to try and attack them on social media anyway possible
---
Remember the days of dying during events and losing all your junk? Those were the days. Seriously, they should bring that back. I played way differently then. Now I don't mind dying at all. I just consider it saving some bullets while I respawn.
---
Any pvper worth their salt doesnt carry junk or look for pvp when doing junk runs. When survival was around I didnt even carry any aid item worth anything. Have my dirty water and diluted stims heathen!
---
Good quote in silly context.
---
you’ve already had the game you paid for, its been out for nearly a year, anything that you pay for is new content, not part of the original game you bought
---
Vendor bots makes me think of selling to the robo vendors
---
I rate your attempt at recovery a 2 out of 19.
---
I constantly freeze up about halfway through this event. Have to exit the game and hope I can get back in before it ends. Only been able to do it 2-3 times straight through.
---
What console are you on? We can fix that for you.
---
I hate power armor because it's clunky, and I lose all my legendary effects and backpack when I wear it. 
---
I have an almost equal carry weight and DR in regular gear, plus unyielding/vanguard/cavalier effects + weight reduction and strength bonuses.
---
Not true
---
Call Thor.
---
Interesting that this is the second time someone on this subreddit has fished through my post history in an attempt to hit me with a spicy ad hominem and both times it was always an attempt to kink shame me. You're gonna have to try harder than that, bud.
---
For pvp I'd say forget about vanguard s and go for sentinel assassin's. But for pve (and pvp if you can't afford SA) vanguard sentinel is fine
---
Yes play styles do differ but you can not be a horder and then cry unfair advantages when you are taking up way more space then nessicacy. 
---
Also why would you engage in pvp if you didn't want to lose junk? Jump servers if nothing else. Keeps you safe and your junk in your inventory.
---
This, or take more than one and hang out standing up. Best if you are bulking things during a defend event.
---
If you don’t power at least one machine they still work but your camp won’t show up on the map so people won’t see it unless they stumble across it.
---
Still good information!!! Thank you good sir.
---
This is really interesting. Good job OP.
---
Do you have a link to part one and part two handy? I just realized I could’ve probably read the whole post and you might have already put them  there already but I already started the reply
---
I agree the lag is bad but it's not undoable by low levels. You can complete it without aggroing the robots and spam the trick or treat bowls to boost the bar. If they stay sneaking and just let everyone else blow up the cars and kill robots they'll live. If they get a few shots on a sneak on only the leg at the end when the event is over the robots aren't aggroed at all.
---
Other then that and cheese it and get up on the roof from the cars in the carpark and stay around the resort you can blow cars up and pick off robots and ghouls pretty safely, you just miss out on the bonfire section.
---
Tbh I could care less about the junk my victims drop (most of the people I run into stash there stuff anyway) I just pvp to pvp
---
&gt;And yes a scrap location can be found pretty easilly, but getting to your junk stash, outside of the tent, you have to go back to your camp.
---
Or a rail station or a workshop or another players camp or a red rocket stop. Or other locations that have stashes in them like Fort Defiance.
---
Welcome!
---
Yah. Yesterday thats wat happened... wasted my ammos
---
Even without that it's still pay2win. Pay2win is about paying for an advantage over those that don't pay. That advantage can be insignificant or game changing. Either way still pay2win.
---
You're right though. Loss of junk becomes less meaningful with Fallout 1st
---
But that’s the problem EVERYDAY
---
I dunno, seems kinda mischievous to me.
---
They're actually right. Zenimax is looking to sell their stake in the company. The sporadic revenue of the atomic shop isn't enough to truly interest investors, but a subscription service with constant, dependable income is.
---
Bethesda promised that all DLC and future content would be FREE and only cosmetics would appear in the atom store.
---
I am level 150+ on TWO account and have now deleted the game and plan to never return after giving the game more than a fair chance, the micro trans bull, TWO UNFINISHED game modes and now private servers and infinite stash among other things are introduced behind a monthly pay wall, that's not the open world sandbox with free DLC and extra content with a Side of COSMETIC micros trans that I paid $100 for.
---
This is just dishonest business and false advertising.
---
It’s not an excuse. I’m blatantly telling him as a person he has no business berating me about having an issue, nor does he have any business on how I spend my money. Do people bitch me out for paying for Runescape membership instead of just using my in game currency to pay? No because they don’t care. Do people care whether I pay for my WoW membership with gold or real currency? No they don’t care. Fallout 76 was going to get on the membership train sooner or later, and we’re lucky the entire upcoming DLC is still free. 
---
I don’t give two flips about my “vote” for Bethesda, or whatever you’re assuming I’m doing. I bought the Fallout 1st for MY experience, MY items, and MY enjoyment. I don’t care whether other people like it or not. Not only that, but the two major bugs this past week or so having to do with Fallout 1st have been fixed in record time, and that never happens with Bethesda. I say more content you have to pay for the quicker Bethesda is going to fix it chances are because you’re paying for it.
---
But the prices are the same on PC where Bethesda makes 100% of the money
---
Xbox one: 11 times. I’ve been replying to my own comment every time the game crashes, people don’t like that here.
---
Broken builds, 😂😂😂😂
---
They’re all from fallout 4 too. They’re trying to sell you shit you technically already owned
---
Not true at all
---
If you see the event octagon flash on the map you should be able to fast travel to join. I’ve used that to discover a few new areas. If you’re low level you might not survive a lot of events, but you’ll probably have a lot of fun running around trying to stay alive.
---
Yes. It can last for days. Open a ticket with Bethesda immediately
---
Don’t spout off like you know what you’re talking about when you clearly don’t lol. Read the news get out of the basement you redpill incel virgin
---
People hate clowns, man.
---
I see what you mean. CAMP Vendors might be a better term.
---
What he said was shareholders, though.  They do not have those.
---
I started doing that and thank you.
---
Both are great but imo the bffr 50cal is better
---
&gt; It's not the best choice... it's ~~Spacer's~~ Todd's Choice!
---
Hoe do i go about that?
---
Does it cost caps to fast travel to it like a normal location?
---
All you have to do is look at comment history, it isn’t really that hard. Sure it’s stupid because why the hell would they waste their time digging to bash Bethesda.
---
Only $4.99 per month or $40 for one year.
---
Fireproof and adenmantium skeleton are a pvp players best friend
---
I went up to WV last year with my family because we wanted to visit some of the places from the game IRL. We went to the Canaan Valley and based out of there. We're going back later in November again.
---
Thanks for this. It pretty much confirmed my findings after I looked in the usual spots for recurring charges.
---
Go to Bethesda.net and click on Support
---
No. Free to fast travel there. You wont lose items upon death during a public event either (events with exclamation points). I'd say go for it. You will probably die a lot but if you can tag some enemies you could get some decent exp from it.
---
Without a doubt, pretty big promises were broken.
---
I don't think they honestly stupid enough to block the DLC behind a paywall, but with the recent levels of excess greed, I wouldn't be surprised if we saw parts of it (such as access to certain factions, abilities) that should REALLY just be including for free considering that for a large majority of the fanbase, a selling point of the game was promise for added content (which the game lacked in the beginning and honestly still hasn't really delivered on with recent DLCs) rather than making it exclusive to subscription members
---
Context?
---
If I wasn't a pvp player I'd be in PA
---
Oh yeah, that's totally me.  You got me pegged correctly on that one.
---
What stat is sentinel?
---
gilpo1 totally doesn't sound like a throwaway PR account name...
---
Alright thanks
---
Cant please everyone haha. It's just a week, let us have our fun.
---
I and plenty of other people would disagree with you.
---
The handmade would be better for a bloodied commando. I'd say lever or guass
---
Yeah imo commando is just vastly superior to rifleman in this game
---
Well not for a rifleman build anyway
---
Well, I mean getting dirty water from a hand pump is laggy too... Even on a private server.  So very annoying.  So not surprised.
---
Fair enough.
---
Any other news about this? Because it's not the only bug.
---
I can't login with username&amp;password anymore with the exe directly. I have my login and portion of my password stored in the custom ini, then I manually type the rest. 
---
It no longer works. I suspect my it doesn't like my long password. I also tried to manually type the whole password few times, while always restarting the exe.
---
Wow Bethesda really out did themselves I’m going to purchase this great price for a great product
---
Bye
---
I’m not much of a PvP guy myself, but I think it’s totally cool to avoid tiny portions of the map and let the PvP folk have somewhere to do their thing.  PvE people still have plenty of space.
---
I’d really like to see dedicated PvP zones where that segment of the community can congregate and enjoy themselves.  Converting the galleria interior into a PvP zone would make for a nice battlefield.  Maybe after Wastelanders arrives, a slowly wandering raider lord with a PvP area around her, kinda like a small nuke zone, would also be fun. It would prevent players from getting bored of the same five hiding spots and sniping blinds.
---
Isn't the pointing of nuking to be an asshole?
---
Launching a nuke shouldn't ever be a "nice thing to do". I can launch them wherever the hell i like.
---
Nope, you're not alone buddy!! I'm a Fallout hardcover fan myself and I stop playing couple months ago since the disappointing first DLC. Not sure if I'll be playing 76 again, but at least Bethesda sent me the canvas bag (yes, I bought the Power Armor edition and just because of the T51 helmet... It was worthy!!)
---
Just uninstalled fo76 after installing the outer worlds. This game reminded me how that classic Bethesda formula feels and honestly I can’t support Bethesda and their bad business practices anymore. Shout out to the cool community though. And thank you for giving me good times in fo76
---
People don't bitch you out on Runescape because they didn't pay 60 dollars to get the game. Not to mention it is a polished experience decades in the making. Runescape was my childhood. Fallout 76 has artificial roadblocks that could've easily been free features, like the Backpack, a utility item. The scrapbox could've been free, the base camp, free. But no, they are putting down roadblocks to problems they created and are selling you the solution. I would've been okay with it just being exclusive cosmetics and icons on top of the 150 atoms (heck I definitely would've gotten it myself), but I am very disappointed in the fact that private worlds are paywalled as well on top of those massive game changing features stated before.  
---
And if paying for content will truly speed things up, why hasn't Bethesda been transparent about it? If they truly said in their words that they are in a tight spot or that this will fund the future of their roadmap quality then fine, but no. Unless you can link a source quote proving it, they are doing it for indefinite growth and profit, not to keep the players happy. It's yet another excuse made by the consumer to justify their purchase.
---
Honestly if I knew they were going this route I'd rather have Wastelanders and Wild Appalachia be paid dlc like an expansion pack. Look this isn't getting the situation resolved and we obviously aren't getting anywhere arguing. I'll stop here, you do you and I'm sorry if you take any offense to this, I just don't like the path this game is taking. Like you said it's your experience. We only have Bethesda to blame. Can't wait for lootboxes, calling it here.
---
Yeah I was dubious at first. Put it off for ages. Decided to use some of the 50+ levels I have saved up...should've done this sooner. 
---
Now carrying 2 1* Bloodied handmades, one with scope one with red dot. Just wreck shit. Its a bit too easy :p
---
You are now a moderator of /r/Sino .
---
What would you call a build that takes next to no damage yet can oneshot standard players
---
Raider life. Its just pure salt at the first announcement. Hell, we've had salt like this from peeps nuking faschnact
---
That's the honest advertisement we would like to hear from now on forward!! 😉
---
Had one where we got it with only 9 seconds to spare.  Each section took a full minute for JES-2R to catch up and allow us to proceed, on top of waiting for the progress bar to catch up.
---
Only had one crash so far though, which is kinda impressive considering just how taxing this event is on the server.
---
Join your friend. They were the smart one.
---
Co. E back for Wastelanders if you want but don't hang around now. No point.
---
Hold out on buying it if you're unsure - there's a good chance that each Collectron will be an individual unit rather than a skin as the vending machines were made available to everyone, and there are pictures of raider, responder, and liberator themed Collectrons in past datamines
---
Don't bring any junk to the event in case you die, but it's totally doable at any level
---
I’m hearing news that they are doing all this to look profitable to investors to initially sell itself and or its assets like Bethesda off to the highest bidder which in the end would mean the fate of the company becoming ea if true is very real
---
Dude ikr once i get a chance imma drop one while the scorchbeast queen is alive to reset it
---
How did you get a private world?
---
Nonono. I know people who are considered "whales", the people who sink loads of money into games. They don't care about how much something costs because they have a significant income, or can just afford to spend all of their disposable income on games. I'm sure you guys probably spend a lil bit of money or whatever, buy shit when they're on discounts, but these whales will buy whatever, no matter the cost. Those are the people these prices are designed for
---
I think anyone who paid $60 at launch deserves a copy of the game and the right to play, or not play, the game.
---
No time to read all the post because work and sleep... I'll read the rest later.  I am more of a builder who adventures some.  Not at all concerned about end game.  I LOVE engaging quests, but the direction of the quests in this game are confusing for the most part.  I love the idea of microtransactions to help generate cash for them, but the price are definitely way too high.  Almost everything in there is 500 points.  There has to be a sweet spot on pricing where demand will increase revenue when pricing is lowered.  Apparently either Bethesda has no clue what this is, or maybe it's more popular than I think.  I could spend hundreds of dollars buying stuff from the atom store, but hardly any of it is appealing, and the stuff that is is just stupidly priced.  I am not so ready to piss away money.
---
Lol it was being handed out like candy what are you talking about
---
raider bot procures chems
---
Well the problem isnt my 420 junk.
---
The problem is that for a month i just can catch every single item in the map , go to my camp and store it.
---
Iam pretty sure that i can make 1500 acid/balistic fiber / lead /springs and screws in one month.
---
I didnt take that much before cuz i havent space in my stash but for next 25 days i will rush farm and make a lot of 556 and .45
---
And will use all my stash to sell legendary stuff. Since people are paying 2k in some 1 star legendaries. Lol and over 20 in explosive sh*t weapons like ghoul slayer explosive pipe 90%rw revolver.
---
I heard that zenimax is buying the election off the backs of whales as well. This is true.  Don't worry about the sources,  there somewhere.
---
What an unfulfilling life that kid must have
---
I’m being serious
---
It is shorter than Kotor, but not incredibly short. I've played much shorter games. I was playing it in my free time for a couple days before I beat it. I took my time and didn't rush. And even then with the way the skill system is setup I wanted to play again as a different character build and make different choices.
---
To be fair, it was likely going to experience a good drop for Black Friday anyways. Get 'em out as stocking stuffers or whatever. 
---
But I won't disagree with you. I wasn't very pleased. Took it in stride. : /
---
I think you’re right. 
---
Last server crash of the night just happened.  Time for bed.
---
people buy it and play it for a year?
---
I agree on this. When you said “the atom shop isn’t meant for some other players”  I felt that because it’s built for people who enjoy buying cosmetics, but what about the other people? But good rant though👍 By the way I think you meant to say Ghost recon “Breakpoint” and not wildlands. Breakpoint is the current one where most of the good stuff is in a shop and has a ton of micro transactions
---
This Is HILARIOUS
---
Its funny when theres a patch and his cheats need updating. He or they have zero chance of killing you bwhahhahah.
---
seems like a good way to clear out the salty players and free up server space.
---
Unsubstantiated, off the wall claim by random person on the internet.
---
Must be true!
---
Bethesda decided to divide the community with this crap now there’s a civil war brewing in fallout 76 it’s chaos
---
Anyone else always being started in third person in N.W.? Not that it's a big deal, just that it hasn't happened to me before the latest patch. Simply curious.
---
I heard Zenimax is recreating skyrim irl off the backs of whales.
---
also you cause an epic level shitstorm damaging your company's reputation for years to come
---
On PS4 I am only getting through half the time without a server disconnect/issue - and to add insult to injury I definitely tag the legendaries (scorchbeast a couple of times and the final robot every tine) and only get loot half of those instances....
---
Says it can't find the image for me.
---
I’ve seen a video on it some investing firm I’ll try to find the source
---
Don’t you just love those times you are able to kill the cheaters though? That’s right, damn lagswitch couldn’t save you that time ya bastard!
---
&gt;Also why would you engage in pvp if you didn't want to lose junk? Jump servers if nothing else. Keeps you safe and your junk in your inventory.
---
Not what I asked but okay.
---
because you can just turn off PVP
---
Yes it is.
---
At this point them being EA would be an improvement. EA access is $30 for the year.
---
they already did that though. They dont have anything left to lose anymore
---
What about paintings on the wall in buildings?
---
Cause I took a workshop on private server, there were no paintings on wall like someone had scrapped them. Did some stuff and found the paintings had spawned in.
---
I had suggested some full PA suits should count(4 Horsemen) when the details were announced, but someone pointed out that would mean ONLY atom shop PA purchases applied for the event which could be construed as P2W. All the helmet skins are atom shop as well I believe(yes/no) that would put them in the same boat, where only those PA users that buy a skin are eligible for the extra rewards.
---
probably op himself after that sweet karma
---
The first hunters only go after things with valuable loot, clearly you have a lot of loot if you can spend prime level cash on not prime level rewards and benefits.
---
Going to add this to the official boards with link here for visibility.
---
First NW match I ever played I got 2nd because a guy on another team glitched under the map. Asshole.
---
Ha, that might have been me. PS4? If so your CAMP is pretty awesome. Happy to spread the Halloween cheer.
---
Priorities.
---
this game was, from the beginning, aimed to make max amount of cash with lowest amount of effort possible with reused assets, assigning a new team, rushed development cycyle etc as Beth doesn't really have any big hits until Starfield. 
---
no sale is worse than half price sale.
---
I know that. what I meant is that the rng in Fo76 is even "less" random than that because the seed might be predetermined when you create your character. or even your account.
---
Why would they need to do that? They own several huge title names and studios. They dont need micros to prove their value. The value is in franchise names.
---
Reason he is so well known is probably because nobody plays anymore since the game is at is lowest point ever. And since the player count is so low it's easy to see the same guy multiple times
---
I play on PS4. Always going up against the same names . We all know each other at this point, as best as enemies can. Sometimes even end up teaming up with one another. 
---
Reading this post made me wonder if every platform experiences the same thing? 
---
Have we all been fighting the same people? Ever since flatwoods...makes me wonder how many people actually play
---
ea just announced they are bringing their games to steam and have been doing decent job lately. ea is not worthy of the ea title anymore, bethesda is the new ea.
---
Dont play this game. They dont care about players anymore. They care about idiots willing to pay for anything, its pathetic.
---
Whale Armor for Skyrim?! Sign me up.
---
I didn’t say it was true I just said I saw some sources and also if it’s not true which I hope it isn’t then that’s great
---
The tables have turned “you were suppose to destroy the microtransactions, not join them. Bring balance to the gaming industry, not leave it in darkness”
---
not for big bidders. they want constant revenue, not million bursts every other year that may not justify the in-between. it's the reason why one of the major zenimax shareholders wants out.
---
They’re too neck deep in bugs to care about cheaters right now. If anything cheaters are inflating their player base.
---
fallout 76 is not a MMO its a single player game with multiplayer added 
---
granted the story part is a bit lacking. but you can explore/kill badguys stock up on stuff just like you can in fallout 4.   ;-)
---
oh and unlike in live servers when you log out while claiming a workshop and log back in it will still be claimed sweet.
---
you're probably thinking of the video juicehead put out a few days ago. people will just dismiss it because it's juicehead saying it, but it doesn't change the fact his logic is sound.

Scammed? They fixed the first issue within a day or so (can’t say that about other game breaking bugs in the game so good on Bethesda for fixing that so quickly) and they fixed this issue within a couple hours.
---
I'm pretty sure that if something rolls for no spawn, it doesn't get a second chance until you switch servers. They might have been temporarily bugged out or invisible for some reason.
---
He only posts and comments on fallout76 stuff too.
---
Where's your proof?
---
Everyone got scammed I'm afraid. Who knows when your ticket will get resolved? Just stop funding insanity.
---
Got a pic of it in your inventory? I only ask because I've had it stay with me for a while after doing Monster Mash.
---
You got your money back then?
---
That sounds like delayed loading of an archive.
---
I would like it if shared xp was area based and so was loot drops. All my characters run different builds but they can all one shot most mobs but i play alone, when i see another player i usually leave the area because one of two things happen.  
---
1. I one shot the enemies and feel guilty about it, Especially if its low level players because i want to help them but the game makes it so hard.  
---
2. They one shot the enemies and i miss out on loot and xp.
---
I don't know how it can be scaling to my lvl with all the low lvl enemies I get non stop I'm lvl 273 and my gf is 190+ so must be broke
---
Oh no not yet I’m waiting on an agent. I submitted the ticket a few hours ago, so I’m sure they’ve got a bunch of the tickets stacked up after today. But I wasn’t scammed. It was my fault for double buying the subscription I had barely woken up, and wasn’t thinking straight. Although it is kinda curious that I can buy multiple subscriptions on the same account🤔
---
regardless of what may be going in at zenimax, private companies can have shareholders; it's not something that's exclusive to public companies.
---
Welcome to the games of today. Every game I play online is like this. Makes perfect sense.
---
Wendigo cave is a good start
---
Yeah it was patched out because I remember being really annoyed they finally fixed it.
---
Because even they know that they will not get anyone new to buy their garbage. So instead they are offering a service at a premium to milk those that chose to stay. If not for those people, their income would drop to ZERO. They are just making sure that the cream of their crops, the Fallout First members get their issues resolved in a timely manner so that they keep subscribed to the service.
---
They will only cater to Fallout First member now. This is literally classism lmao, only those that pay the ransom fee for new features have a voice now. Regular players are literal dogshit.
---
It’s ok, it was a relatively recent change. Now no one can camp Encrypid to steal others hard-scavenged loot!
---
FYI, I don’t think this applies to all events, just the special ones that were renamed “Public Events”. These ones give you a server notification once active.
---
So they unlock one a day but you have all week to get them. You dont have 1 day to earn it. So best to just wait til all rewards are released.
---
That's interesting, I recently encountered a guy who one-shot me with a .50cal. I've gone from 0 to 108 with a heavy guns build and have never been able to one shot anyone, even with all the right cards and buffs.
---
This is disappointing, he seemed like a decent person.
---
It's Providence Equity Partners, and they own 30%+ of Zenimax, not all of Zenimax.
---
Not to be rude but being able to buy nonstacking subs on a single account...that is textbook definition of a scam. Hope you didn't lose $100 twice...
---
Same here friend. WAR never changes, but the game industry sure has. I recommend the outer worlds to fill the void. There are definitely ways to download it before buying it, and I know you love the writing and game mechanics!
---
The executives are wearing them all to work.
---
So if I get the first reward tomorrow, I don't have to wait a whole extra day to get the second reward, right? That was just me misreading the post? (We have currently unlocked the 3rd reward)
---
I wouldn’t say textbook definition, nor would I say scam, but it definitely is an oversight of their system for sure.. I only did the month to month to try it out.
---
And they want to use this engine on StarField...
---
This. They have to carefully figure out how to still meet the promises to their bosses and provide well thought out statements. Probably figuring out what to provide as compensation or how to handle the scrapbox and stuff being non 1st exclusive without making those who did pay for it feel taken advantage of.
---
Last i heard it was just about the Investment firm ;) But yeah, doubt that what's going on.
---
Right now most likely it's simply the decision to give away all future content\* for free plus awful launch driving players away (and less Atom sold) has left ZeniMax panicking and so the Dumb happens as they try to make 76 be producing all the caps like it's brother ESO.
---
Fuck oath
---
You can get full stealth with chameleon gear. It doesn't get much love because everyone is unyielding, which is good too. I think it's better than a vanguards set for pve, you only take damage when you want and can reset stealth by moving to a different spot unlike unyielding. Once you get around 350ish dr and er, there's nothing in the game that can one hit you with blocker. And you take so little damage, with a binded heal you shouldn't die.

---
Their support ticket system was 'broken' into a while ago, so what made you confident that they have their affairs in order when it comes to billing/account system?
---
I mean, on launch day people had to redownload the whole game. Too many strange oversights and I don't think you'll be getting thag money back, they'll just give you two months of which the first weeks is bugfixing the issues...
---
It’s incredibly difficult to do. You need more than the perk card, you need to also take chems as soon as you think you’re about to run in to people. Either that happens out of sheer dumb luck, or you planned to, by knowing you will always head-shot people with an aim-bot.
---
That’s the reason why aim bots use heavy weapons, so they can chem up and have a minute of no-reload headshots. 
---
So when you get one-shotted in full marine and 100% health by a heavy weapon, either that was crazy dumb luck, or they have there own little system going on behind the scenes.
---
No, mate. Just no.
---
1: I'm not doing anything. I don't play that piece of shit because I have more than a few brain cells to rub together.
---
2: I have just explain to you why people are doing that. If you lack the intelligence to understand, or you're too arrogant to be willing to accept that there is actual reason for the apparent "madness" - well that's on you.
---
3: Clearly, the biggest problem with your comment is the fact that you don't understand that when you support anti-consumerism... all you get is anti-consumerism. You also need to understandthat when people make the horrible decision of supporting the worst game that Bethesda has ever made, you are communicating to them that it is okay to continue to drastically degenerate in quality.
---
Do you not understand? Supporting 76 Bethesda it's okay to make shit games. So Fallout FU First subscribers are communicating to Bethesda: "we don't need your quality to improve".
---
It's like voting for the best party, because it's the only sane thing to do, but everybody else is voting for the party that promises to feed you nothing but shit for the next 5 years.
---
Speaking of shit, maybe it's time you pull your head out of your fucking arsehole.
---
Wait, you guys didn't buy the customer support DLC pack?
---
Wow good drop if it's real.
---
4 out of 4 successes (so far) for me (XB1X), although 1 time it got questionably laggy and unstable before stabilizing. I'm off the next 2 days, so I'll be hitting it up every hour \*fingers crossed\*.
---
Play the game if you want.  At the end of the day you don't have to spend money on anything except the base game to enjoy it.  Yes they are making cash grabs at the player base... but it's a business.  Just enjoy if you want, but don't tell others to not play.
---
Sounds like a good bunch of folks lol
---
My dreams of getting that cool goblin mask may not be completely dashed after all, lol.
---
Not a bad idea tbh, would be the first time they would have incentive to fix their game.
---
But they can't, they're still using the same engine that was on his deathbed 10 years ago. Todd Howard just put 16 times the makeup on the rotting corpse and hired a ventriloquist to shove an arm up its ass. 
---
But even Todd knows at some point the maggots will have feasted on the flesh the arm will be visible protruding through the pelvis of an skeleton. The undertaker Silas is getting impatient...
---
I decided to make my camp in such a way that i have a room full of levers and switches, all within "reach" of my chair in front of a window looking out at my camp. This lets me mess with people shopping while sitting, staring at them creepily. Some open doors to rooms with no exits, others open garage doors that i use as window shudders, while most turn on/off lights or other wired things in camp (jukebox, decon shower, traps). Its been a pretty good time, but i would still love using my pip-boy while sitting there.
---
No. It's a conspiracy theory. Latest info as far as I'm aware is from 2015/16 about Providence (investor) thinking about selling their stake or ipo. Nothing mosince then.
---
Right on man. Folks seem irrationally upset about this. Get over it. Bethesda doesn't owe you a god damned thing.
---
Yes 3 rewards are out. I got the first one first day and now have 2 showing in my challenges section.
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
F4&lt;F76&lt;F3&lt;FNV
---
Lower your graphic settings. I'm running low all except shadows medium. Everything is fine for me, tho I restart game client after 3 runs to clear the cache.
---
This is the regular Monster Mash Mask from the Watoga High school event. Source: I have one still from back in the day, and the Halloween rewards have been datamined. (no monster mask)
---
then don't use the icon/outfit?
---
Seconded! If you liked the classic Fallout games, you'll like OW: Obsidian rose out of the shattered remnants of Black Isle, and they know how to CRPG well.
---
I paid for it. I'll use it
---
Star wars makes me sad too. They bring back the emperor after killing snoke like he's the gerber baby. Lando flying around banging everything that moves. I gave up. C3PO looking like he's going to the scrap pile in 9. It's become a joke with some writers who think they're clever playing with the script.
---
It just keeps getting better and better.
---
I reinstalled 76 a while back to give it another go but it was just so boring. I got outer worlds yesterday and its awesome, i was up till 3 am playing it! It feel like when I played fallout 3 &amp; new vegas the first time.
---
That is unbelievably fucked on consoles, because doing a chargeback or disputing the charges can get your account and every purchase ever with it banned.
---
Nothing cause I forgot to pay on my credit card linked to my Xbox acc so the payment for my gamepass didn’t go through
---
It's the doom devs in the bathrooms.
---
TIL: the crashes are part of the event ;-)
---
then don't be surprised people are targeting you?
---
why
---
don't you have to hit them back to even take dmg?
---
It’s a necessity punishment you will for such a monstrous decision
---
"Because their parents wont pay for the sub".....rot in federal disposal field HZ-21 you filthy firster.
---
Just say you're a fallout 1st member to Bethesda and they'll listen
---
I fight back, two more appear
---
because it's obvious people are going to target you. you don't go for strolls in dangerous neighborhoods flaunting wads of cash and then act surprised when the obvious happens: you get mugged. do you?
---
The only time it would crash for me is with a TON of people + entering the level up menu.
---
I have worked in the airline industry for 8 years and currently on year 5 with delta. First class passengers don't board first, those needing special assistance travel first, such as those with who struggle to get around and have disabilities. You keep throwing this false analogy out there every time and it is quite annoying. Stick with facts, it will help your case better.
---
Never mind, seems the RNG is just incredibly bad sometimes. Finally had it show up.
---
I guess a patch qualifies as DLC then too, yes? Bug fixes too? I mean YoU dOwNl0Ad ThEm?!?!?
---
&gt; I can't go anywhere without getting attacked
---
Have you tried going to your private session?
---
"Holy shit they actually believed us, I can't fucking believe it. Pete, hand me another cold one."
---
~Todd Howard
---
Hi Grushnak, I’m an ironic furry!
---
Fuck Bethesda
---
Sometimes you get those 2. They show up at whitesprings outside the event too.
---
no
---
I see a ton of new faces on PC all the time + ofc there's the usual suspects :)
---
I... pressed the wrong thing I guess
---
Twice there were legendary scorchbeasts at the same time as the event - can’t say if they were related or random.  But they were starred and named “legendary”.  But no loot even though my weak level 25 ass hit it dozens of times.   Same with the final sentry - hit it many times then moved over to let everyone get a hit.... then no joy
---
&gt; I paid for it. I'll use it
---
But you won't use the private session?
---
I would if I could. Its just that no one that I know are much fallout fans as I am.
---
Well, you can always go in first person and look at the ground as you walk with jes 2r. It's not fun but it's the only foolproof way of not crashing. That's what ive been doing ever since I kept crashing all day yesterday
---
and you need other players to enjoy the game? plus you just said you fire back.
---
so far all I'm hearing are problems that you're causing yourself.
---
I don't know why this sub is so determined to downvote the obvious here. You're absolutely correct in pointing that out.
---
Damn man, I did see one awhile back before the event. I'd freak out lol
---
I'd like to know if the dmg bonus counts for non-vats hits as well.
---
Happens to me sometimes with them too, or the queen.
---
I missed the robot too, even from hitting it, still nothing.
---
Lmao, sorry to hear that man.
---
:/ isn't fighting back just exasperating your problem in the first place lol.  Could just bounce out.
---
They dropped it half price because of Black Friday.
---
My source is using xEdit to read the game files myself.  Here's some proof: https://i.imgur.com/yaU0u2U.png
---
My method is checking the reference in the "Chance None Global" (LVLG on left), which leads to the float value (FLTV on right side) of 80.  This means there's an 80% chance for none to spawn, so it's a 20% spawn chance. Repeat the process for 20 records or so, type it all out so it's plainly easy for everyone to read, then get trolled with paranoid accusations. Side note: tin foil hats can spawn in the boxes where Mischief Night starts.
---
Apparently he isn't...hmmmm

---
Why did you pay for the subscription if you weren't going use the private world?  Isn't that the point of the subscription?
---
Idk, but I have never encountered any hate towards ppl in costumes/with icon/doing dances.
---
I'm Fallout 2nd member myself (Kappa) and all I think about Fallout 1st is that robot dance looks cool.
---
It's why I am here.  I love a good gaming shitshow and Bethesda has truly outdone their previous stellar achievements of doing the bare minimum while fistfucking their fanbase.  I am in awe of their powers of incompetence and shamelessness.
---
Fallout 1st.
---
What bug?
---
A lot of people are assuming the salute is part of a new bundle. I have a personal theory. The game assets are full of things that were created but never implemented into the game, including several emotes. I think it is possible that originally, Bethesda planned to have a Communist faction as part of Appalachia, in opposition of the US Government, but for several reasons then chose to replace this with a faction of non-Communist seceders instead - the Free States. Note that the Free States was the first faction that gained a salute, some time before the Raider salute. In the emote files, the three salutes are lined up in the order Communist, Free States, Raider. The emote that showed up in the game without an icon might have been an accidental activation of some of the cut code.
---
I'm sure it's just glipo2 and glipo3 downvoting me anyway xD
---
Yes
---
While annoying, it was hilarious. The nuke hit Top of the World but had enough radiation to kill me, missed the event.
---
But the fact you pay for expansions means they aren't just using cosmetic mtx as a revenue stream as you are suggesting.
---
Shit like that is what makes this game so dope. Bethesda has been making great games that are buggy for the better part of 2 decades at this point but I still love them. I was hard on fallout 76 when it dropped because it wasnt what I expected but after I gave it a fair shake this game is actually a lot of fun
---
Likewise, you can do those things standing, so why sit to do them?
---
Oh look, the ignoramus who claims Bungie releases new playable Destiny expansions for $30 every two months is accusing me of making false claims. 
---
I didn't say they haven't improved it. I said they haven't resolved the issues that killed my enjoyment of the game and led me to quit.
---
To paraphrase one of your posts: it's incredibly annoying that some people can't accept there are others who have legitimate complaints about something they enjoy.
---
I'll disengage now and let you go back under your bridge now that I've given you a few snacks.
---
Oh ew lmao
---
im just being a dickhead its not that bad i just wish there was another way to get the skins cause i dont feel like playing battle royales right now.
---
Oh, the pirate hat actually drops? I thought it was an atom shop item
---
you dont even have to be good i played 2 games and got like 300 in one just afking behind a dumpster
---
Haven't been doing it too much (tho it is very fun). But I got the pumpkin pants suit and a bunch of camp stuff. I really want that grim reaper cutout!
---
Nuke the place if you want but you better be able to solo that event since no one else is gonna be able to
---
I’m at #11. Only out of 1 of those was I able to log back in to claim a reward. Disappointment 76
---
More like long term nickname and gilpo was already taken. I've never been clever enough to come up with something better.
---
Game constantly crashes while doing mischief night I get lucky if I manage to make it through one of them lol seems to be happening more on console than pc
---
Not really. I’m also on PS4 and, besides some lag and one time I froze whilst melee attacking a sentry bot, mischief night has been fine for me. And on top of that I’m from Australia where we have notoriously bad internet lol
---
Don’t listen to these people that don’t play this build lol. My bloodied unarmed has higher DR/ER than you can possibly achieve in any power armor. At 20% health I can take more than enough hits to heal and only ever go down at encryptid or scorched earth once or twice. 
---
You’re asking good questions, but the build doesn’t really work that way when you have it right. Barbarian, ironclad, and evasive plus scaly skin and grounded mutations give you the ridiculous armor rating (600+), but the really really ridiculous package is Serendipity, lone wanderer, nerd rage, and blocker. You’re basically invincible. 
---
Using adrenal reaction and talons mutations with iron fist, radicool (ridiculous for 1 point), incisor, martial artist, and adrenaline 1 give you that sweet sweet 1500+ melee damage.
---
The rest of my build lets me run semi auto rifles as well so there’s more than enough points to sub commando for auto rifles too. Here’s my build:
---
[bloodied unarmed rifleman](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fd64378&amp;d=la2l71lu2a71am2a30a00ir2c72ej4eu0p00pd2pk2pp2pl2s92sf2ss2sg2se2&amp;w=&amp;m=51c2fe8g&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
Only if the DLC somehow changes the meta of the game. It seems like replacing the bloodied build with something behind a paywall is the only thing they could do to get some folks around here to get upset.
---
if you have money, sure
---
What if you bought the game because it was nationally advertised as "All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76, all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, **the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff.". If you purchased it because of this promise that you wouldn't have to spend ANY more $ on content, and then they do the polar opposite of that promise; have you gotten what you paid for?**
---
Mainly because it's what I'm interested in at the moment and I feel like I have something to contribute to the community. I read a lot of posts elsewhere on reddit but I don't feel the need to comment just for the sake of commenting. Trust me, I would love to be paid to do this. Then I wouldn't have to work the 50-60 hour job that I'm currently stuck in.
---
I didn't think you could scrap items that were already in a workshop. Guess I haven't tried, but yeah. Doesn't sound right
---
Ah. I've done 5 today without an issue, but I'm on pc. Console is usually weird that way. Especially since Bethesda has their own launcher on PC but on console it has to go through Microsoft or Sony's stores.
---
Got off work early yesterday; off today.  20 attempts, 4 or 5 crashes; 2 of which I got nothing as I didn't reload in time.  Got 6/10 pumpkins, 2/4 racks and a bunch of doubles, short suit, pirate hat.  Bought the cut out and another pumpkin plan.  3 WS jumpsuits; but I already had it before the event.  
---
My kid got both pumpkin suits in his first 3 runs; lucky little punk.
---
Out of 4x runs, I had one crash on the PS4 just after I got there.  Otherwise the runs went fine.  
---
The biggest issue for most was that the legendary big bot at the end was killed too quickly.   Too many players with heavy hitting guns.  That being said, I have had more crashes than normal since the last patch.
---
I've always found the idea of ‘secret’ PR Accounts on subreddits interesting, so I spent some time looking into this.
---
https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#gilpo1
---
The account has spent over 78% of their time in a FO76 related subreddit, with 0 interactions on other subreddits. Interestingly, ole Gilpo has a history of 3d rendering?
---
Could just be a dude that REALLY likes the game, could be a PR account. Interesting that they've never had a bad thing to say about the game and was instead a pretty level headed person when dealing with some game hatred / discontent. Even games I've liked I've bitched about. I find it hard to believe that most of the current player base that has spent the last 12 months requesting certain QoL features to be included into the game (Stash size etc) are happy with paying more money for that to happen. Especially after Bethesda spent so long saying it was a technical restriction, then released it as a “Premium Paid” feature. It’s a disingenuous move by a game producer that I typically enjoy, however, moves like this concern the player base.
---
Little bit rambly, ut my point here is this: For someone who is traditionally level headed in this subreddit, what are your thoughts on the sub service Bethesda brought out for the game?
---
For the record I stopped playing the game some time ago, the game world just felt so... Empty. Also think the idea of a subscription service for this game with those benefits as ridiculous. But that feels in line with Todd Howards thinking regarding monetizing and extracting as much money as possible from their products (ala his comments regarding Skyrim).
---
They’re being responsive to their actual customer base
---
I have crashed during  40-45% of the seasonal events I've joined. 
---
Do you use a ps4 pro?
---
Did you buy the game just so you could come on and whine about it? 
---
You’re a bit special, aren’t you?
---
Not really.. I’m an average consumer that wanted to see what all the hate was about. I kept up to date with all the fallout 76 hate propaganda. But eventually I caved in. Purchased the game and learned the hard way that this game isn’t worth 59.99 a year later into the release..
---
Normal armor with the right perks and legendary effects can be way better than PA. I say PA for heavy gunner and non-pa for pretty much anything else
---
I think the quote was no season pass or dlc, but fallout 1st is neither of those
---
It's a PvP game and as such you have to deal with things like that.
---
The real issue is that \[arguably\] there should be separate PvP and PvE servers.. or mixed.
---
Have you met Activision?
---
No, regular 500 GB model
---
Yup, called pirate costume hat.
---
it adds up from when the challange is unlocked. once the final one is unlocked it will zero out and you'll have till the 12th? to get 14K of experience to unlock the final away....now thats going to be a fucking struggle. I'm half of the mind to just wait for the final one to unlock and play like mad till I unlock the last ones.
---
they've been seriously neglecting backpacks. specially for something they hyped so much.
---
1/3 of the original designs still isn't in the data files, like the mothman and hiker ones. the other third is in the data but was never released.
---
ok. you have offloaded your salt onto a thread of players who mostly like 76,(bugs and hiccups aside)  now kindly bugger off. what sort of loser hangs out in forums dedicated to games he doesn't like and complains about them? I was extremely dissappointed in starwars online ( the original first attempt they made) not once did I go onto a public forum filled with their players and bitch and moan about it. wtf is wrong with you?
---
Sweet, one more thing on my list to get!
---
i mean, why not just add a animation. like is your next to a bar or table eat and drink food.
---
I want to use one because they're useful, but none really stand out to me. I did see a nuka cola one that I wanted, but idk that it has ever been on the atomic shop (not the little cooler, a taller rectangle one). Backpacks definitely need a little more love
---
Some containers work the same way I believe? Hence empty containers in a fresh private world?
---
I’ve gotten plenty of camp shiz so far but my costume rewards have sucked and the legendary loot has only been one star.
---
Yeah, Bethesda is worse
---
PS
---
Some items at some workshops can be scrapped. Not all though I believe.
---
I use a pro. So it might just be the ps4 hardware in general then.
---
I have a right to complain when I purchased a digital copy (not worth 59.99) . Wouldn’t you complain about a product that ain’t worth its “salt”? What kinda of loser complains about terrible products? This is the internet, you probably live in a hob goblins basement to have never seen someone Btch or complain?.. what’s wrong with me is, I only tell the truth to stop people from buying these products.
---
Sad to read these post. Wtf is wrong with BGS? Why can't they do there job?
---
the only one in the shop other than the cooler was the oval, metallic one I think.
---
the rectangular one is a hiker backpack I guess. been wanting that one too. but it's not even the data.
---
I guess the fact it's so goddamn hard to get the mods turned a lot of people off.
---
I thought he was just good at first. I get quite a few kills in the occasional match, but game after game I've seen him wipe team after team.
---
Lmao.. this would require them to actually care about the community... you’re taking a about the people who know buying 1st is bad for the game and community but still do it anyways because “muh ranger outfit” or “muh atom shop skinzzzz.”
---
Well then. Good to know
---
And usually those 20$ skin bundles in Fortnite is actually more the just one skin. Its often bundles with several skins/tools/glider/bacpacks. 
---
Just with having a battlepass in Fortnite and play the game will net you several skins and other cosmetics.
---
right you have complained, people have read your complaint even though there are no specifics about your complaint and will take it under consideration. your work is done and you're a bloody hero now and can puff out your chest with pride. so there is no longer any need for you to post here now is there?
---
Yep, here's a list of records with "ChanceEmpty" in the ID: https://i.imgur.com/STzclK0.png
---
how about one of the more recent in the vaults where they announced that both text chat and perk loadouts would be coming? people just love to shit on bethesda for everything without checking out the facts
---
Maybe get fallout 1st and play on private??? 1st exists for a reason dude...
---
uhhhhh they take forever to fix bugs the hinder the player but quickly find ways to hot patch the good bugs like the power armour glitch tho aye there only here for the money everyone knows that
---
Honestly, I think it's a three way tie between Bethesda, EA, and Activision. Ubisoft is a close second.
---
I think Bethesda's has set a  new low with Fallout 1st.   People who don't understand why are part of the problem.

To be honest, if you can't kill Noob that's your own fault.  I met him by essentially killing him multiple times.  I am old and my aim is half ass at this point.  If I can kill him and you can't seems like a personal problem lmao.

I did the moth dance with another player after Mischief and someone, like a deadpan constantly out of breath man trying to remember his lines, said "first is gay, first is gay" and left immediately.
---
That's the extent of my personal run-ins as a dirty firstman.  And I use the 1st icon as a passive bait. Not sure what OP's doing. I'm sure he never instigates.
---
Fanny packs for all!
---
I’m hearing conflicting reports about that monster mask. It wasn’t on the datamined loot reward list as far as I know.
---
I got a top hat, witches dress/hat, and a few others...   I've coupled the top hat with the witches dress and my character now kinda looks like a costume from "The Matrix".   
---
For me it's more about the plans than the costumes, though.  I've gotten 3 different jack-o-lantern plans so far.
---
the latter.
---
On PS4 and haven’t had this issue
---
I checked several of them, and they all have a 10% Chance None value. So, a 90% chance for loot to spawn.
---
And Wastelanders will probably be a buggy mess at launch because they don't use test servers like Blizzard does with Overwatch and Behavior does with Dead by Daylight. I really want FO76 to get better, but I've been burned by different companies too often to trust them anymore.
---
You've got some shit luck, mate. I've yet to see anyone react poorly to firsties. It's either been good cheer, or the same non-interest you get from people whose only goal is to farm whitesprings \*again\*.
---
I do enjoy the game very much. Do I like the game? Eh, most days. Honestly, it scratches a couple itches. I have hoarding and collecting compulsions in real life and this allows me to indulge without spending as much money on real life things as I could potentially. And it keeps my house from filling up with crap I'll never use. But there are days I really hate the game. When it took almost an hour for me to sell a plan to a player because of glitches. I about threw my keyboard across the room. The repair kits made me mad as I saw the slippery slope coming and here it is. But yeah, I did sell out and get 1st. That scrap box is so dang nice for my play style. But keep reading for my other thoughts concerning that.
---
Not sure how you get that I've had 0 interactions outside 76 (that page isn't loading for me). I haven't made any posts elsewhere, but I replied to posts in other subs. I read /all and only comment when I have something I think adds to the conversation. I got on reddit over a year ago more to learn from others and not to talk, but I felt I could help the 76 community so I created an account this year and started posting. I'm not one for conflict so I'd rather just walk away than fight over something that doesn't matter. I left Facebook to get away from all that crap. I have to work hard to keep a level head as I don't need stuff like this to get my blood pressure up. My 3d background ended over 10 years ago and was focused on architectural rendering. I would have loved to get into motion pictures or games but there's not a lot of opportunities for that where I live. The events of 2008 caused a career change and now I'm in to e-commerce. I can't remember the last time I opened Max.
---
My thoughts on the service? It's absolutely pay to win. Or, as someone else said, pay to tolerate or pay for convenience. There's really no winning fallout as everyone would define that differently. But the scrap box was a huge game changer. I honestly felt like I was cheating the first night I tried it. Like I had installed a hack or a trainer. It drastically changed my gameplay and I really felt a little uneasy about it. I haven't gotten to the point where I'm really making use of the private servers as I'd rather play in an environment that's more alive. Private feels dead. But with being able to put my scrap all in that box, I have much more room to store legendaries in my stash and not have to make as many hard choices as well as am able to offer many more things for sale in my vending machines which gives me a much better caps cash flow. A definite advantage.
---
I understand business and businesses need to make money. Cash flow is what kills businesses. They need income they can count on. A subscription service gives that. I don't see 1st going away. But what I do see is them using it as a test bed for new things and then rolling those things out to everyone after a certain amount of time has passed. I would be absolutely shocked if everyone didn't get the tent and the scrap box at some point in the future as those 100% should have been in the game from day one. I made a comment to someone the other day that I can see myself giving this game maybe another year before I move on to something else. I have a tendency to give everything I've got to a game and then move on and never come back. Before this it was Breath of the Wild. So when that sequel comes out, I will probably be done with 76. 
---
Hope this answers your questions.
---
Shame, thanks.
---
Yeah, I haven’t seen that. I don’t do the emotes, but I do use the icon and the riot gear, and nobody attacks me. 
---
Now, if I see somebody else in the riot gear, you can bet that I’m switching to the gladiator outfit/red bandana/black rim sunglasses with a hunting knife and stabbing them. But I just do it out if fun, not to ruin a night.
---
&gt;All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76, all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That’s important. And to say,   
---
&gt;the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff."
---
 All the **CONTENT** we **EVER** put out for Fallout 76, all the DLC, **ALL THE POST LAUNCH STUFF**, is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, **the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff."**  
---
I would have to disagree and point out that fallout 1st qualifies as **both** content **and** post launch (which are clearly expressed as free being free in the quote).
---
He is also wrong about who boards first in the airline industry and especially Delta. I've been with Delta for 5 years and airline industry for 8. I know a lot and have done a lot. Don't listen to his analogy, let's just say it's a bad one.
---
What's the spawn rate for the Scout Armour gas mask?
---
I got one during one of my first enclave events, accidentally scrapped it, and haven't found one since.  I've been doing a bunch of Enclave events and checking the Enclave vendor and no luck \[PS4\].
---
Then there is the plasma grenade plan that hardly ever spawns...
---
Trolling.. It is kind of funny to think there's a group of salty girls running around.
---
Try again.

&gt;Buy a dishwasher that advertises a free X year warranty included.

---
Welcome to the future of "Games as a Service"
---
I mean congrats on being an entire week late with this, I guess.
---
 How do you use VATS to lock onto legs and switch to head?
---
can you source that quote? ive never seen it before
---
This game does not need text chat
---
The last thing we need, is people spamming lines of text.
---
There’s a perk card in perception called Concentrated Fire that allows you to target limbs! Very useful to lock onto the head &amp; get that headshot damage!
---
All these incels telling themselves 76 isn’t a hot pile of dog shit. OP is right. The vast majority of people on this thread think this game is awful. The outer worlds is way better. Fuck Bethesda.
---
Seen it low as $10 on cdkeys.
---
1. The game is dull and boring - I could watch paint dry and feel slightly better, I can’t play this game longer then an hour..
---
2. Pc keys layout is terrible
---
3. Other players carried me- went into the game with the mentality, that I was gonna earn most my gear and items! Little did I know, that higher players just dropped items on ground and simply ruined the game for me.
---
4. Didn’t have to ask for items (still got them)
---
I didn’t expect that I’d be getting such good loot when ever I killed something.. I had a full inventory of guns in a matter of minutes of killing mobs.. 
---
5. Atoms shops are complete sht
---
6. Not worth 59.99 - a year later into the release of this game, I still tried it out with that same price tag.. 
---
7.  Hardest learning curve - didn’t bother learning most of the game, wasn’t worth my time, the tutorials were just as fun to watch then watching dirt move.. 
---
8. Game just isn’t Bethesda quality...it’s EA if not worse..
---
I promise you, no one will play this game longer then when they first played fallout 3.. I spent hundreds of hours playing fallout 3.. I only played about an hour of this crap... comparing to what Bethesda gave us a long time ago, to this utter pile of crap game. It’s unacceptable and frankly terrible that people like you that support this game even exist.
---
10.
---
He’s good. But I killed him several times early game. Late game, never.. people exploit their builds and use meds, doesn’t mean their hacking...
---
I’ve had a few multiples. I’ve got four toons and weirdly I’m getting multiples on the same toons- like the cutout or the Whitesprings junpsuit.
---
And speaking of the jumpsuit I feel for anyone that bought one recently!
---
I'm actually very disappointed in Juicehead. He's normally better with his sources.
---
The original video he references holds no more weight than one of us making up a theory about because of all the greedy scummy tactics of late, Bethesda must be going bankrupt.
---
I'm surprised people apply so little critical thinking that this conspiracy theory has lasted so long.
---
Downvoted for being realist? Uh, in what world we are living?
---
There are not egouth people (atleast on PS4) to even start one game when americans sleep and europeans are in work.
---
It’s actually just Todd playing his god account
---
I seriously wonder if they've had an increase in visitor traffic from this game drawing attention to it. If things were different for me, I would have gone up there myself and played tourist.
---
I turned the first 60 seconds of this video into a clip for my soundboard and I blast it through area chat at anyone using the new emotes. https://youtu.be/WoACRHhbtvE
---
just subscribe to NW premium, they will actually ban bots then :)
---
Nobody deserves this.
---
16 Times the details...16 times the bugs
---
Here is one. I can find plenty more as this was a big selling point of fallout76 at first. 
---
Full quote = "“All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free”, Bethesda’s VP Pete Hines said back in October of last year. “That’s important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the RIGHT side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”

---
Because it just works!
---
They just add bunch of new Wastlanders related .. vault 79 .. reputation icon.. faction icon.. new notes.. so likely we can see something new in ITV soon about this DLC ( before Christmas )
---
Nice try Todd
---
Nice to know!
---
Because this is not a finished product.
---
This is my first fallout game, are all of them this boring?
---
i know right!
---
hell even if it was a fucking 1rst only feature lol lol
---
give us text chat dammit!
---
works fine for me so far
---
For a second I forgot I was on r/fo76 and thought you were asking that question in a general sense.
---
You forgot the /s tag after your comment.
---
Empty pumpkin rack is in the game, had been dropped as a reward, and has been built in a camp. If you’re on pc I can show you.
---
I've been doing the event by myself on a private server to avoid the lag.
---
I have 11 game crashes so far. I’m done playing for a while.
---
Oh now we're talkin!
---
Go pacifist if youre not already, make your camp private so they cant scout it.
---
Blame eveyone with explosive weapons. They need to be removed from the game. It screws performance for everyone in the area.
---
Few questions mate you got a mic?  Ill be on again soon but gotta finish gathering my xp in nw for todays skin.
---
There’s a lot of datamining for Wastlanders DLC
---
Yes I got a mic
---
Same tired comment, and same will be removed too...
---
I got the pirate hat, skele outfit, some pumpkin stuff. Some cut outs.  That mole head.  Im waiting for the pirate hat and cool suits.
---
Ok cool Ill hit you up shortly then.  Do you wanna do some nw with me.  I have about 600 xp left to build for the skin unlock.
---
I'm not the best nw player anymore
---
But yeah
---
Aim-botting doesn’t make you invincible. I’ve seen people take him down one or two times. He can still take damage like anyone else. But player after player note the same type of encounter with him, and we know how widespread it is to use third party software.
---
Experienced gamers can tell when they’re being screwed vs when they were outskilled or unlucky.  I could give you all my anecdotal accounts of him wiping out our team from a crazy distance, one-shotting all of us, while everyone was running and jumping. Maybe you could write that off as a randomly lucky incident. But dozens of people with the exact same issue with this specific player? All with identical stories of him making impossible kills? It’s crazy to shrug that off.
---
You were given every warning if you paid attention. Now you know. 
---
Caveat emptor.
---
Thank you for one of the only comments having to do with helping me rather than hazing me. I got it though I appreciate it a lot nonetheless.
---
You have to be delusional to believe it's just PR and poor marketing.
---
The whitesprings ghouls achieve flight through sheer willpower and severe genetic mutations. Truly a majestic creature
---
Yah your right, I’ll never purchase another product with terrible reviews..  I learned that the HARD way..
---
I would guess it will cost you about 5$ in atoms for that
---
Did you read that? Nothing there to say he isn't.
---
I was on a server with 3 queen nukes and the Mischief Event went just fine. Some servers are just shit and blaming players for playing isn't going to fix it.
---
there is a sullution to your problems, just buy some petrol for 12€ (that you been saving) pour over yourself and set on fire
---
On the plus side you posted this at 1AM so it probably won't get many eyes on it preventing it from really being noticed.
---
Oh I dont really enjoy it Im just working on getting to lvl 100 for all the unlocks and for the halloween skins of course.  I usually come in top 10 as I play by stealth.  I am not a pvper i suck lol.
---
They're cowards. Rather than talk to us like people and do their job, they'd rather hide behind carefully curated PR statements in their Inside the Vault articles or gaming news outlets.
---
Even with all the shit that Blizzard went through with their Hearthstone and China issues, they still had the decency to comment and update regarding an unrelated mobile app issue with Hearthstone.
---
I get that they're going to get flack. Some of it probably very unreasonable and mean-spirited. They can do their job and actually face the community and address the concerns and issues we have. 
---
Cowering behind PR walls isn't going to win over the community. This isn't some shit that'll just blow over.
---
Only if it's on sale
---
It was the same with Faschnaut.
---
This is just pumpkin faschnaut.
---
So you're openly saying you're going to attack fallout 1st users?
---
Tom Howard 🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
Yeah I guess the ws suit is common now.
---
I'll join
---
I mean people did warn you didn't they?
---
Dude, don't try and have your cake and eat it. This is literally what you pay for being an early adopter. Not a smart one either as the writing was on the wall during beta that there were issues.
---
Whole reason why I waited until prices were more reasonable before buying in.
---
Sure
---
Because on PC it's not true which is why they got downvoted, I think.
---
People talk shit on reddit but I've never experienced any hatred towards subscribed users. I really doubt people will follow through your crazed agitation
---
Have you not seen what is happening to this sub or in game? It has begun my brother, even if I wanted to, what is happening cannot be stopped. I’m merely a messenger
---
After playing fallout 4 it was hard playing new Vegas. The dated graphics and the game play felt dull compared to fo4 but fallout 4’s storyline sucked bad i am really trying to give new Vegas a try since I’ve heard great things about the rpg/story element of the game just hard with the out dated gameplay/visuals.
---
Look at the ratings for these games, then cross reference those ratings to sales and expected sales. More importantly look at how these are changing the way people are viewing the company as a whole. The financial choices,  the early unfinished products and re use of broke resources from old games all smooshed into a greed filled package that your only trying to sell more. The only poor people buying are diehards that love you guys and your doing them a greater disservice than any one else.
---
You really dont have to look very hard ffs.

Just rhymed off the top of my head in 30 seconds. Like i said. You do not need to look for reasons. You cant help tripping over the fuckers.
---
Additional feature to toggle on/off fallout 1st icon for $.99 everytime toggled.
---
Okay, but after you have everything actually paid for, does the bank then demand more money for you to use your closets and other rooms? Does the dealership demand more money so you can open the back doors/trunk?
---
Tell me, what perk card and weapons was I suppose to use against the player “fly-walking” 500 ft above the city, firing at everyone with an automatic, and staying up in the sky the rest of the match?
---
Sheeople.
---
.. and with that reply you moved up to class AAA idiot. You are now at Trump level idiocy. Impressive!
---
Openly a griefer and encouraging others to do so, blaming the "victim" (I use that term loosely) by ruining their gaming experience rather than addressing the problem with the source of the issue i.e. Bethesda and yet you say you love the community and the people within.
---
Interesting.
---
Also dodging the question about whether this is just an attempt to recruit for the Discord you're in.
---
How else would griefers get thier kicks .
---
Not at all, with the pace things have been going I haven’t had to ask anyone to join. I’m not about to start. 
---
I’m just getting the message out. Thank you for your time
---
Nope, it's a glitch. After you finish monster mash mask stays on your face until you log off. Also you can't take it off
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/J50Nqdd](https://imgur.com/a/J50Nqdd) This shows all the items leaked, but the liberator/communist themed stuff is all there.  I actually just noticed the image for the emote is the same as the outfit in the bundle.
---
lol, damn. yeah they def back peddled, I might have taken a different tone in some of my posts today. 
---
I still am happy with fallout-first and I’ve been loving my private server and actual stash space, but now at least I understand some peoples frustration.
---
Not at all. Fallout 3 will always hold a special place in my heart cause hype and all that, but objectively New Vegas is probably the most fleshed out of the series.
---
4 is OK, but they focus a lot on building and tbh I never enjoyed that. Different strokes for different folks I guess
---
they sure do, 2 years ago I would have preordered any fallout rpg, multi-player, single-player, bug-ridden who cares? still pre-ordering. Now that's out of the question. It's now buy it half price 6 months after release if I buy it at all. If even a quarter of the outrage around this game is real that's a lot of people that had a similar change of heart. That's a ton of money lost and it only gets worse and worse the longer they keep that shit up.
---
It is not the server it is your shitty hardware not being able to handle all the action. Yes, a game shouldn't be that demanding but people with decent PC with a reasonable setting are not having this issue. Your 5 year old ps4 with shit 8gb RAM is not getting you anywhere. Go to private server and solo the event. That's the only solution
---
Not at all. I would never recruit anybody, we haven’t had to.
---
We should post more stories and highlight from NoobMaster3000's exploits on here as a symbol of Bethesda's failing this game and this community. 
---
He can be the Vault Boy for Bethesda Game Studios.
---
God I have this one dude in every round I play on PC that headshots me out of nowhere, I keep seeing him all the damn time, and he always ends up killing me.  Wish they'd actually do something.
---
If you cancel after a month? Why would that get you banned??
---
I was in there for ages (20 minutes or more) and that painting didn't appear whole time. Computer loads things fast anyway.
---
Ty for the silver stranger - its my first ever! 
---
p.s. I never expected anything from my post - in fact I hesitated to post it - almost felt its a waste of my time. Then I thought, "no you wrote a mini essay, not posting it is a bigger waste of time."
---
The Elite riot gear is supposed to make your shoulders broad and look like a tank and add a ton more stuff to the face mask. It looks cool, but not like the original suit from LR
---
Exactly my thoughts. The elite set looks more like the advanced one to me.
---
Some Fallout 1st players could literally not log in to the game or play it all. That's a game breaking bug across the board for PC players and was some thing they could immediately address. 
---
The game being laggy or people getting disconnects is obviously more involved and not something they can immediately fix. It's a consequence of so many things happening simultaneously and the engine or hardware not being able to cope. What are they meant to say or do about that? Server stability has been an o going problem from the beta, if they had a simple solution to fix it they would have by now.
---
All this love for Noobmaster but nothing about Salty.Fry...dissapointing...
---
Do I need to buy fallout 1st to get a response from you guys?
---
Up there with Toyz7
---
Bethesda have drunk deep from the EA/Activision's cup of greed
---
&gt; I didn’t have to ask a single person.   
---
&gt;\[...\]  
---
&gt; Let’s get to 400 tonight. 
---
This speaks for itself. Again.
---
&gt; I have no interest in conversing with you if you aren’t willing to have a civil conversation. 
---
I've been civil throughout. No name calling. Made no assertions that were untrue (unless you'd like to correct me).
---
All I have been doing most of the time is pointing out faults in your comments and pointing out your hypocrisies by using your own words against you as evidence of it.
---
Not to mention the hypocrisy of someone who actively is looking to ruining the gaming experience by other players talking about civility. 
---
Also, let's not get too sanctimonious about all this griefing to send a message to Bethesda to get them to do the right thing. It's just an excuse for being an arsehole to other players. That's it.
---
Maybe you should be civil i.e. polite and courteous, towards other players irrespective of whether they have purchased Fallout 1st or not.
---
I'm aware of how seeds and pseuxorandomness works and how poor coding it is to pull a seed from something that is unchanging and controllable is.
---
Here is where I explain to someone else exactly what seeds are and how hard "randomness" is in computer code.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpalmb/my_time_in_appalachia_has_been_quite_a_mixed_bag/f5uig7w/

That is failure most abject.
---
Not sure if this outcome is a reflection of your and your team's competence or of that person's sheer and boundless incompetence.
---
Either way congratulations for ridding the skies of the flying vermin.
---
Someone else likened it to having an alcoholic friend.
---
At first, they're your friend, you go out for drinks and everything is good.
---
Later, you go out for drinks, your friend has more than they should and causes small problems, but, they're your pal, you remember the good times, so you cover for them.
---
After that....
---
Evertime you see your mate he's messed up. He drinks so much his health is suffering. He drinks so much he shits himself. You actively try to avoid him now. You tell him that he needs rehab or he'll die. Afterall you still care about him and want him to get better..
---
That, imo is where Beth are now. In a dive bar, at 10 am, covered in vomit.
---
The next big AAA release is rehab. They come out of it either better than they were or doomed to shit themselves in a corner untill none of their friends care and leave them to drink themselves to death.
---
we suggested this in like patch 2
---
Same, that post crash load screen only stops when leg sent bot is killed.. I got lucky once and spawned in just in time to get the reward, other times I crashed and got nothing..
---
yeah, we suggested that they add real action bar customization and fix repsonsiveness probs in like patch 2\~
---
Maybe Bolton greens golf course. Pretty sure there's a pelvis bone by one of the cannibal stations outside
---
Wearing only a power armor chassis will allow you to jump from any height and take no damage. For that reason alone it's worthwhile to carry a chassis... Though, in your inventory a chassis weighs the same as a fully kitted set of PA, so might as well carry a full set. The Excavator set has many benefits, and is the only set I carry. I also use it for nuked zones (saving 5lbs from not carrying hazmat suit), and the occasional overload condition. Otherwise I use regular armor.
---
I've been posting about this all over this subreddit. This is the way things are going to be from now on. The paid stuff will get some attention and might come out in an acceptable state but all the free stuff will be half assed.  
---
IMHO, due to their financial state, it will stay like this until the game is dead. They have utterly destroyed the reputation of the game and the company so almost nobody will buy the game. The only income is from the atom shop and subscribers, so that is getting priority. You can be mad about that but it serves no point, I do not think they have a choice if they want to keep their job and get paid. All their fuckups have brought them to this point of no return.   
---
Wastelanders MIGHT be the exception to this because they advertised it so much. For me that will be make or break. If it's free and it works (just), that will probably be the last free DLC that is worth anything. All the other free DLCs will be the same broken mess as the halloween event.
---
I might sound bitter but IMHO that is just the state the game is in. There is absolutely no point in yelling and crying. Especially not against FU1st members because they are keeping the game alive right now, financially. For that, I thank them.
---
Also.. Dead super mutants loot. Just kill a bunch of those and it will drop.
---
Bethesda is a shit gaming company. Why do you remain loyal to a company that could give a shit less about you.
---
It’s in the game already
---
It’s called an AAE LMG. Brings them right down with a crash
---
Well thought-out and written i wonder if it will reach the desired people.
---
Found one buggy side quest myself but it can be resolved by shooting someone in the head - not anywhere near as bad as some from recent Bethesda instalments - OW is brilliant.
---
No. She give level appropriate items. If you use a low level character you will get low level gear.
---
and what would that be friend?
---
I could literally pick sentence after sentence you wrote and refute it - but why bother..? You do you, mate.
---
I have 1\* conc fire, but could not work out how to toggle the limbs, but  just found it, I have to use the mouse wheel :P
---
Reason I ask is if I wanted to load up level 8 mules with scrip would I get max level weapons for its pinned to your character level.
---
The syringer method what is that?
---
Nope been whack this way since FO4. Guarantee theres an invisible wall there and the game is borked into thinking you cant put anything back.
---
It's fake news.
---
I've had people on console message my friends who are more open about owning private servers and they have been called whales and other more insulting names.
---
Nearly every camp i goto has the stash box. NW is rife with icons/ranger armor/helmet. I believe its made up.
---
You use a syringer with the bloatfly barrel. Find an enemy, shoot with syringe, kill them, spawn bloatfly, shoot with syringe etc etc.
---
Good ways to farm acid and glowing meat. The legendaries are just an added bonus
---
Haha, good job. Please also report him (though it sadly doesn't seem to matter anyway).
---
Give it a few, oceanic is about to gear up
---
Sometimes I find a place to put it, and it puts it on the upper floor and I can put other objects around the same area. And sometimes it says something like building restricted. I don’t remember it being this bad when I built the place. 
---
Maybe I should just tear it down and rebuild it
---
Good idea, I may try leaving brown bags with random stuff at other players CAMPs while they're away. I already drop stuff all the time while at my CAMP, because I always carry too much and end up being over encumbered. I drop realllyyy good items sometimes, having to make tough choices with limited space.
---
The only issue is I'm afraid people won't always notice the bags. These brown bags are easy to miss. Dropping them at a strategic place is important. So if their bed is NOT locked inside their CAMP, that may be a good strategic place to drop stuff. Good thinking by OP's reverse trick-or-treater :).
---
Downvote me all you want but it seems to me people are digging for controversies now, making up theories that *MIGHT* (not saying they aren't) be true
---
Nope.
---
While in game, go to challenges and it should be in character challenges
---
I was going to say, OP is naive buying it at that price
---
Standard PvP build vs standard PvE build. The difference is quite staggering, especially from the latter's viewpoint.
---
There was a canvas shortage so they can't lower prices. No worries though; the GameStop Nuka-Coka helmet is going up on discount for FO1st players next week.
---
Like almost everyone else who complains about it, no facts here or any justification or review but a salty infested salt-jerk.
---
Or, and stay with me here, Bethesda could make the game work on ALL of the platforms they released it on.  Strange idea I know, but maybe it'll catch on.
---
They're half the player base; kicking them would be the death of the game
---
Again some guy that doesn't play the game trying to comment, it's like teaching without qualifications, laughable and stupid.
---
Very descriptive.
---
Never once have i ever been targeted, nor have any of my  50+ friends that have brought it.
---
If anything it is just the same PvP bullshit, but it's the " I want private wurldz to avoid PvP" idiots playing on adventure mode because they need the fucking "freeloaders" help to complete events. If anything at all I've witnessed these fools try and trigger mutation PvP and take workshops from a level 7, shoot me while I'm shopping and spam dumbass dances in my face...at my camp, not just 'omg I'm triggered cuz were at the same event'. Evidently they're looking for a junk box or wtfever it's called. I'd be less pissy if your fucking fast travel tent didn't cause my only camp to not be available.
---
I got a halloween paint but idk where to see it. And i just earned somerhing new but it pops out too fast, i couldnt see it.
---
Fake
---
Oh I did, but as you said, Bethesda doesn't give a shit unless you're a fallout 1st member
---
Sometimes I can better place things when I first store, then place them. Instead of moving it from a position, where it was already placed.
---
Or you put a Capet underneath it, placing the item outside/somewhere it can be placed on the carpet. When you then move the carpet you can place the whole how you want.
---
Super_combat was the one that did the most damage, and the hackers focus was driven to me and axedass, so a mixture of both
---
And thank you
---
Thanks, I’ll try these when I get on next, hopefully I can get the workbenches back into position, I really like how I had them
---
Nah, that title goes to CDPR... Greedy monetization pales in comparison to constant employee abuse..
---
Yeah the game should run on my old pc with pentuim II with voodoo gpu. They released the game on PC so it should work right?
---
Considering that NW on PCs is infested with aimbotters well above lvl 100... Yeah, they really don't.
---
Yeah I'm used to that. I just didnt know if I was missing something. I have 4 peices of s/a gear and it doesnt seem to do much lol.
---
Especially if someone pays monthly for it though, right. Regardless what their shit machine is, they deserve precedence... Lol
---
if i go over the ammount of xp needed for a weapon skin before it comes out do i mess it up
---
It snowballed from a rumor into a myth.
---
Endless things to do is misleading
---
The same repeated fetch quests isn't fun
---
It's the same with elder scrolls once you finish the main story and all the side quests you just have the same repeated faction quests
---
No, it shouldn’t, it seems every item is set to 0 xp when it releases, though that could’ve been because I did the first one before the second released
---
Exactly. There's tons to be upset about Bethesda's greed... But for these folks it's not enough. If the narrative seems dying, they have to invent other reasons to bitch about... C'mon people, at least be fair and roast Bethesda for the actual issues, not your fantasies...
---
I'd give ya gold but I wasted $13 on Fallout First
---
This has been around for a while and it drives me insane
---
I got that and a Whitesprings jumpsuit.
---
Or a paid feature they won't bother 'fixing'
---
There's a sort option below
---
It genuinely makes me laugh that you think Bethesda cares about bad press.  Fallout 76 has gotten almost exclusively since launch, yet Bethesda continues to one up themselves on shitty decisions.
---
You're acting all smarmy and superior when you're wasting money on a shitty game and company, and your total lack of understanding just shows that you are mentally backwards and are in no position to insult me.
---
Long pants pumpkin suit.
---
Yep. The moment Bethesda rep steps into F1st discussion, the people will roast him alive. 
---
And what would he say? Any justification from their side would be dismissed as "PR speak" and "damage control". Any steps back or even cancelling of the whole service wouldn't lessen the uproar because people would still harass them for implementing it in the first place.
---
Silence is the best way to not pump oxygen into the fire. It has been proven times and times again that when an action causes such outrage, nothing can calm it down. Explanation, apology, rollbacks... Nothing works, people still remain angry because they want to be angry...
---
And I'm saying that as someone who got too tired of Bethesda's greedy schemes... But I want to be fair even to the bad guys. Sadly, most poeple don't...
---
That's cool, I get downvoted for pointing this out. Don't forget these "
---
It was the only one I liked. :(
---
As a 1st subscriber $9.99 a month or $60 a year for private WORLDS, 1500 atoms, cosmetics and scrapbox would be nice with the tent being made available for everyone. This would keep the scrapbox behind the paywall but any 76 player would kill for a free portable camp a would have been a nice gesture for those who won't/can't pay extra. Also Bethesda wouldn't be giving away the farm and the exposure of the locked scrapbox might entice players to subscribe once they figure out they can dump all the scrap they want for the month and draw out after the sub is over. 
---
But because they've chosen to ignore the non-payer Bethesda screwed themselves out of that chance. Also poured jet fuel on an inferno by not having that goodwill gift. Paying or not every player should have got the tent for free imo.
---
I will remind folks too that there is another Bethesda game (ESO) that costs $60, dlc's from $20-$60, a microtransaction shop, and a $15 subscription with an unlimited crafting materials bag included. Oh and if you want your own bank and merchant?? Well that's another $20 each. (Updated prices may vary but you get my point)
---
Yawn...either play the game or don't ..
---
Good points. Sorry was mostly thinking to myself all the main game's quests and nuka world, far harbor etc was all fun stuff for me. 
---
Didn't mention things like Preston and his settlements that need helping 800 times or nobody would play 4 😂
---
That's why the other sub came into existance... Any time Bethesda screws something over, we get an influx of outrage tourists who keep feeding oxygen into the flame. Just compare the number of active sub users before and after this announcement... I can guarantee you that many people don't are about the game. They just want to take a jab at Bethesda at any cost.
---
It's funny how they are constantly talking about paid Bethesda shills, when there are apparently as many paid anti-Bethesda shills... The large amount of Outer Worlds promotion here makes it quite easy to notice...
---
The Tesla reportedly ignores assassins sentinels after the bounce, taking around 11 hits to kill a player in assassins sentinels, but with full heavy leather and the energy resist backpack, you can survive closer to 25 hits. But mainly you need to keep jumping to avoid the bounce lightning.
---
That shit will be gone within a week lol
---
I’m a 1ster and I’ve had no griefers, what  am I doing wrong. These post were players are saying they’re being harassed for being FO1ST members      are just assuming that’s why they’re getting grief. Griefers just grief everyone and using you’re a 1ster as an excuse as to why. If you wasn’t there would be another reason that they were grieving you. Just ignore them, they’ll soon get bored.
---
It's not you believe me 😂😂
---
Just Todd Howard and more of his usual bullshit
---
Bethesda hasn't been very creative in the last few games
---
1 and 2 are amazing, looks like you're bombarded by the laggards of the fallout community suggesting non-rpg fallout titles
---
You sure do talk about beating a dead horse a lot for someone that keeps using the same joke...
---
People inventing reasons to attack Bethesda? Color me surprised... Or not. This sub gets ridiculous at times when Bethesda screws up. Even r/Games is more fair and objective, which is something I never expected to see. Many people want to take Bethesda down, no matter where the truth is. And they do so, because they know that many likeminded people came here to do the same...
---
I don't know if I'm more disappointed by Bethesda or this "community" on this sub. At least Bethesda prentends to care about the game and us players. The "community" would just label us players as criminals or something like that...
---
Seems to work alright to me, but I just got a set.
---
Does your cow have a name?
---
Take all Western workshops, do the retake events, not defend.... Retake. Otherwise kill things, as normal, in between.
---
Except there is something called system requirements for PCs that tell you what kind of hardware your system needs to run the game.  Consoles don't because all games released for them are supposed to run properly.  Nice try though kiddo ;)
---
I had that after Monster Mash and I hated it and couldn’t take it off. Only I could see it though.
---
What a dumb comment. Have a downvote
---
Another dumb comment...
---
I’m kidding come on man
---
Oh, sorry
---
Just saw another thread about this same sorta thing happening, with a few people saying they were also gonna be doing it. I'm 100% joining in, this shit is wholesome and adorable.
---
Even faster if you click on the moderator "bethesdareplied" to see all instances
---
People’s opinions on YouTube is not proof
---
I haven't seen any griefing. I've seen a lot of fallout 1st players running into each other on public worlds and using their emotes together. 
---
I think most people still playing the game aren't honestly that bothered by it.
---
No levels shouldn’t stay away, it’s an event for everyone. So they might die a lot but why should they miss out on getting some treats. There’s always plenty of high level players that can finish the event anyway.
---
I'm not having any lag at all. Is this just a "vocal minority" as they like to say on here, I really can't tell
---
I’m PS4 and I always crash if I try ft where everyone else is. I’ve started to ft to Watoga train station and running there.
---
I've gotten the skeleton suit and the fireman outfit. The one I *really* want is the pirate get up.
---
You literally said you are trying to scam them
---
Into giving you free atoms.
---
Yeah I don’t like it either.
---
Scrapbox works just fine. The players who tried reporting that showed they dumped items then forced quit to the desktop thus the game doesn't cloud save, thus no junk in the scrapbox. 
---
Civil war? *looks around* most players are at whitesprings doing the new halloween event and when not are doing other random events. Not much of a war if you ask me...
---
Atom shop prices were lowered. It's important to recognize positive change.
---
Enemy AI is the same as all other 1st/3rd person fallout games so....yeah. So are most of the bugs come to think of it.
---
Poor story? Unless you're next response to this is to enlighten us with your knowlage of the story of 76 thus far then you can't include this as valid criticism. If you don't know what the story if then how can you judge it for what it is. 
---
Canvas bag was a shit show I agree. 
---
Non-cosmetics in the atom shop are a non-issue some decided to inflate imo. A scrapbot cost 500 atom. Start a new character with 0 atoms and in a few short hours of gameplay you'll have enough to puchase it free of charge. I and many others keep out scrapbots unlocked for everyone to loot from too. 
---
No npc's is explained in the storyline in a really cool "ahh makes since" moment. And wastelanders was planned all along, just go ask our raider robot friend rose....
---
The worst I had in my playthrough was getting stuck in the weapon modding page once.
---
I was wondering if that is what happened also. It’s all speculation of course.
---
YES!  I've noticed that as well, Level 213 XB1 since beta.   Too much damage from low level ghouls or mole rats stood out to me. Sentinel looked like it had zero or the complete opposite effect...EXTRA damage.   This is just on top of the fact that the ghouls not only now skate forward faster than a olympic speed skater on meth but now also run BACKWARDS faster than a player with every speed perk, AP refresh, Ultralight and Speed Demon active.  It was so ridiculous last night that I just had to bust out laughing while playing.  Just never know what insanity you will log into each and every time.  Last week In Whitesprings, I log into the middle of an insane Assaultron war. 90% Assaultrons...mole rat appears, 5 Assaultrons fire at the same time and hit each other while liquifying the mole...then it was on!  red lasers against red lasers with robot explosions upon death. IT WAS AWESOME.  Sure it was a bug, but was actually the most entertaining bug I encountered in a long time...lol
---
I thought it was lame and may demand too much attention but it's a lot of fun. The trick is going to 19% health, not 20
---
Agreed, I've run it about 12 time now on Xbox one X, haven't crashed once. It's laggy as hell at points but it's never crashed.
---
I actually froze up after respawning during the fight with the sentry. I waited a few minutes before restarting. When I logged back it I still got rewards from completing the event!
---
Unless you do a 19% health junkies with adrenal reaction and nerd rage...?
---
Might I ask you why? I dont mean to offend, I am just curious why you would do that.
---
Except you didn't buy shit you moron. The EULA that you accepted when you installed the game basically says that they can do everything you are saying they can't.

Funny I tried outer worlds and found it boring. Made it to the groundbreaker and just couldn't bear to start another drawn out dialogue cycle. To each their own though hope you enjoy what I couldn't.
---
Yea xD im sitting on 3k atoms all earned in game and there is nothing i want to spend it on. Not because stuff isnt nice, its just not worth. Im waiting for the ultimate item
---
I made some 'carpet units' with everything on it I want for the bungalow and the greenhouse, then moved the units inside, building inside them is a pain without the carpet trick.
---
Why mention being at 20% health and using nerd rage. Are you one of his pals that don't play a bloodied build?
---
welcome to the new world :D
---
Lousy do you still happen to have this i could pay you for it
---
🤣
---
My understanding is you need to be wearing an outfit to get those rewards
---
Can confirm, am dead 👻
---
/r/shittynosleep
---
Fallout First has made you suicidal?
---
How pathetic are you?
---
Oh I’m not the one that’s gunna die!!!!!!!!
---
The rad storm gives them strength to take flight
---
Help Kits
---
Have you actually played the thing?
---
Fallout first makes puppy’s suicidal
---
So you played through the tutorial and decided you don’t like it? Lol. Why? I know it starts off slow but what exactly didn’t you like?
---
If the game loses too many *paying* supporters it'll stop being supported and die. 
---
Hosting costs money, developers cost money. They were never going to support the game long term without people paying money to keep it running, be that through new purchases of the game or spending in the atom shop. Obviously, the atom shop and the new purchasers wasn't enough so now they have to try more agressive monetization methods.
---
So yes, if people who aren't paying for fallout first or atom purchases want to leave, that's great.
---
I saw floating ghoul too last night.
---
Yup, EA is over here like, "Heres a shiney new Star Wars SP game with no microtransactions whatsoever".
---
Bethesda: "How much can we piss people off before its unprofitable?"
---
I posted something similar to this and got destroyed by a heap of pricks saying it's not an issue. It is an issue. Paying to pay for paying to play.
---
This. Low level players have nothing to lose from taking part, and plenty to gain.
---
Just like Faschnacht (spelling?), all they have to do is chuck a few molotovs or fire a few rounds off, and they get full credit.
---
Wait.....what idiots actually brought the pass anyway?
---
i got the jackO pants suit, pirate outfit, and pirate hat so far
---
“Game is dull and boring”. Yea the intro is slow. It picks up incredibly. Sorry your 1 hour experience running around flatwoods does not represent the rest of the game. You are really missing out. You came in expecting to see “how bad” it was. I know you won’t do this, but take a step back and actually play the game with a fresh perspective. By the time you are level 15-20 you’ll realize it’s the same fallout that you like.
---
psst it also works in Nuclear Winter, you get 5.56 ammo.
---
Says the people who are showing Bethesda they can get away with whatever they want 👀
---
Whoosh
---
Turn off team fill, half the wait time.
---
Oh interesting. I usually freeze at the cottages or the park. I'd hang around frozen if it was near the end of it but usually happens in the first half of the event..
---
People who are buying the subscription are enabling these scummy practices. I don’t see any reason why we should be thankful for that. Quite the opposite. They need to wake up and see they’re getting fucked over.
---
I don’t see why not. Didn’t post man outfit have this?
---
Exactly. They’ve paid for the game just like everyone else so why shouldn’t they be there.  Plus even a rubbish reward is like a rare reward to them.  The game needs new players to keep it alive and everyone was low level once.
---
FYI you need to earn a standard backpack through a quest in order to craft those skins.
---
500 atoms is extremely easy to get in game though...
---
Everyone?  I've had no bugs in mischief night.  I'm sure some people do, but to say "everyone" is just wrong.
---
As a revenge for us fucking up the oceans, right?
---
Every time i see a post like this i have to support it, for me, that i can't use mic for various reasons, that will be a game changer since actually i'm forced to play almost alone :(
---
&gt; Console is usually weird that way.
---
Nope, I (and others) have done it repeatedly on PS4.
---
I'm very tired now but I might come back later
---
Looks like that "wait and see" approach is working out great. The moneyflow must be that good even if it doesn't seem that way. 
---
How do the veterans still play this game when there hasn't ever been a truly meaningful content drop in a year, just atom store BS. Idek what to do when I log in since I cleared the map, I just lurk this sub hoping things turn around. Wastelanders release, good or not, will be stained by the Fallout 1st fiasco.
---
This is ”intellectualy disabled”.
---
You realise Bethesda themselves recomend 8GB of RAM right?
---
I think it's weird that everyone in this sub keeps acting like they lied about capping the scrap limit due to technical stuff.
---
I mean they added scrapboxes in and instantly there were problems including all the scrap just disappearing. So clearly there are technical issues that came with it even a year after the game released. It's doesn't seem like they just hid this feature. It clearly doesn't work great and I can't imagine it would have worked any better back in release.
---
Here I thought the butthurt crowd had finally shut up.
---
So buying multiple  fo76  games to run mules for larger stash is also pay to win,
---
The problem as I see it is that Fo76 only rewards group play within events (besides the small xp-gain from perks), and since we can't initiate the events anymore, a healer has become obsolete.
---
I've done mischief night six times so far, no problems at all.  PS4 PRO.
---
This guy made a post half an hour ago stating that we should shoot up Bethesda offices. OP is a fucking psycho. Check my comment history if you don't believe me.
---
The union outfit changes the backpack when you wear it
---
Sorry bub you must be at the wrong game...this one is dead
---
damn, someone with common sense, hard to find nowadays on this sub
---
Quite to the contrary! Healers aren't *needed*, but they're far from obsolete.
---
"Holy shit. That makes life so much easier.", is the usual statement I hear while I'm in groups, and post-runs it becomes, "Yeah, wow. That was fucking great. Uhh. Totally going to need to tell someone to run support now."
---
That I can't argue with, though it doesn't feel dead with all the people running around!
---
Can only hope that there's a stable group out there!
---
r/iamverybadass
---
what was the problem?
---
Isn't that what the game's about?  Nuke it up!
---
Jesus, it's a fucking game.
---
To be fair it's not like they're giving as any more communication that usual. Back in the day they'd respond to maybe one top post every 2 weeks but besides that only responded to urgent broken things. There's always this myth that Bethesda is super talkative to this reddit that I never understand. It's pretty much always been like this since beta.
---
Lag caused by high volume of explosions and players with heavy weapons is obvious. The problem is obvious, and it's only going to be fixed by them working on the servers after gaining the data on an event like this. They can't easily make the servers just handle the entire playerbase nuking the whitesprings.
---
The fallout 1st problem was that a service was down on their end and people were COMPLETELY in the dark. All they had to do was fix it so that it was back up. It's a lot easier to fix let alone address.
---
Well here’s the thing, that analogy is terrible because you should **never** pay someone to build a house up front. You either pay them for when it’s built or pay for it on stages, so you can ensure the house gets built. Paying for it upfront is a good way to loose your money and not have a house at all.
---
Hey if we naruto run they can’t stop all of us.
---
Without art what are we? Where are we, who are we? WHY are we.
---
THATS WHATBI BEEN ACREAMING.STOP BUYING THERE. SHYT ..EARN IT
---
It says "75% chance to reduce damage by 15% while standing still", it's not 100% chance. For this armor to be effective you need more than one piece with this effect.
---
At launch, Beth mocked our request for push to talk voice comms.  They really didn't seem to think why would anyone want PTT to the point that simply including the option was a foreign concept.  And the FoV slider! \*sigh\* I can't stand hot mics. 
---
My first experience with the game was some mouth breather deep throating his mic while I was getting fussy with the character creator.  When I realized what that weird static was, I immediately finished my character customization and ripped through the settings until I found the mute.  Then felt so horribly disconnected from the game, because my only way of communicating was through the fucking emotes.  And there aren't even that many of them! Still! 
---
I know I created my own little Hell, but i remembered thinking how deaf people were supposed to play.  I've played online games with deaf people before. Deaf gamers do exist, but fuck 'um, apparently.  Or even without getting dramatic, what about someone trying to be quiet as their spouse/child was sleeping nearby? Or the walls are super thin and they are self conscious about the noise carrying? They can wear headphones, sure, but they'd need to type to respond.
---
And consoles I know, I know.... well FFXIV mixes servers between console and PC gamers.  They use a keyboard attachment just fine.  And FFXI before that had some prescripted dialogue options you could choose from.  They were mostly for talking to the Japanese and vice versa (mixed US/JP servers... not as mixed as you'd think with the whole time zone thing, though) They ranged from common greetings to more game specific ones referencing in game locations/terms/skills/etc.  So I'd select \[Hello!\] and the Japanese person would see the equivalent in moon runes. But I digress, my point is that something similar can be added to be console friendly. Keep them simple like \[Want to party/trade?\] \[Follow me!\] \[Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries.\] and link them to another stupid wheel like the emotes.  It'd be *something* at least for when you can't talk.  
---
But considering they had to bet twisted into PTT, but there just doesn't seem to be much backlash for this? I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Didn’t they initially say it was free to players?
---
Well yes and no. The subrscribers are getting fucked over, yes. They're enabling these practices, yes. However, I really think this game has gotten beyond the point where the revenue from sales only can support the dev team. They could start fixing the game to improve its reputation and therefore increase game sales but that process is a slow one. Negative advertising usually outweighs and outlasts positive advertisement. It would just take too long for sales to pick up. So they NEED the subscribers. Because they have just a small developers team, they focus on that stuff. Free content is now very low on their priorities list.  
---
So yeah, IMHO the subscribers are paying their wages. yes they are enabling this scummy practices but I think there is no other way now to fund the game.
---
Yup, tried to eat some soup and froze instantly.
---
Yes, I know. I have a full set and has had that for a while. It somehow seems less effective now.
---
How do you heal? By eating stimpacks with appropriate perks, or by medics weapon?
---
Did you know you can mod certain automatic ballistic rifles to use 0 AP per VATS shot, provided that they have -25% VATS cost legendary mod, for an infinite spam of critical hits?
---
Fallout Techcare Subscription program is included in Fallout 1st
---
We had to beg for push to talk voice comms, and the official Beth response was *mocking*.  We had to twist their arms into simply adding the *option* for PTT.
---
So it feels more like some combination of incompetence or just being that out of touch.
---
That's all they ever do 😂 that's why there customer base is slowly going away
---
I completed it with 6 minutes still on the clock by my self.
---
I don’t know anyone who paid 100$, possibly some did but mostly everyone went with monthly to see how this will go
---
This is Bathesda PR account.
---
Any legendary item with a chance effect like "While incapacitated, gain a 50% chance to revive yourself with a Stimpack, once every minute", basically the game flips a coin so you have a chance to pick yourself up. The same goes for sentinel it won't protect you from every hit.
---
Is this constant, or only in the initial period after logging in?
---
I don't run sentinel yet I made very tanky toon. Ghouls don't hurt me, besides the rads they inflict.
---
I logged in recently and went for One Violent Night immediately. Since some people were in already, I took out Tesla so I could easily tag without oneshooting stuff - this didn't let me see there's something wrong with my character. It didn't load fully and I noticed something wrong when I let a ghoul nearby and he literally one-shot me from my 29% HP. I was like "wat?", and went there again to retest. Another ghoul, another one-shot death of mine. "wat" turned to "WAAT", and I went in for third time. This time I could easily tank lots of shots and 100% of the danger came out from rads, just as it was supposed to happen.
---
99.9% of companies dont give a shit about you.  They just give a shit about your money.
---
I've got the whitesprings jumpsuit and pirate costume. Finished the event maybe a dozen times. It's not like Fasnacht, the rare rewards aren't "almost unobtainable" rare.
---
So your saying we should have paid for fallout 76 in stages? If that was an option I certainly would have done so. Give them $30 at launch then $10 per dlc if it ever gets released.
---
But we don't make the rules or have the option to negotiate a better deal, do we? We are stuck with the lies Bethesda told us as they perpetually alter the deal because there is no binding contract of service, just the reputation of the company. Normally the reputation of the business is all you have to go on in the gaming industry and Bethesda has decided to take advantage of all their customers instead of delivering on what was paid for.
---
If they were a construction company, they would never get a new contract with these practices. In fact, they are behaving like a company that's going out of business that cares nothing for their brand.
---
So do you really think we all deserve to "lose our house" because we paid up front? I think not and you are a total clown to suggest that's how it should work for games.
---
Yeah give them the scrape box but unlink it from crafting tables and then provide that service as extra to fallout first members. Same goes for the survival tent. Everyone get one, but only fallout members don’t have to pay the hundred caps to move it.
---
Anyone else die towards the end and when you respawn the game crashes?
---
This was posted yesterday from someone appearing to be the actual user. Why have you reposted it with *less* information?
---
Pants suit, shorts suit, pirate hat, fireman helmet. I’ll be satisfied when I have the pirate and fireman outfits.
---
It can be one star it’s just not worth to go for 1 star. Plus from my experience chance of dropping the fixer seems lower then other guns, but it can be just that it seems lower when you really want one... anyway i have mutant slayer 3 star fixer for sale 😅
---
It’s more a circle around certain items like roof pieces, stairs, and foundations. For your stair problem you can make a new stair piece to support the floor, remove the original stair piece, place things under the original stairs location and the stairs will snap over. It’s pretty picky and will take some trial and error, you can also place things on rugs to make them stick to the floor better but I try to avoid rugs because it’s a budget waste. 
---
This games building is really frustrating at times but with a lot of practice it really is quite amazing! Good luck!
---
Too much clipping
---
Truthfully I just like it for the tan grip and stock. I just use an auto two shot  combat rifle a lot and wish it was a fixer. You Xbox or PS
---
Loot boxes are 1000000 times worse then subscription
---
"Am I the only one..." 
---
No, there have been dozens of posts like yours in the last week.
---
I’m on PC, I did get some fixer eventually but I’m trading scrip on 5 characters (all of them have learned the plan)
---
It’s attached to your level. I use it to get low level stuff for mules :) I’d say take the low level stuff and make an over powered level 10 haha
---
Except some consoles age horribly and cannot run games properly
---
You do realize that's the minimum requirement? You do realize RAM usage jumps up to 13gbs from time to time?
---
Which is an upgrade to the Gamebryo Engine, so technically you are right :-)
---
Would like to just point out that there is really no penalty for death in a public event since you don't lose junk.
---
They say 8gb recommend also.
---
Well personally it happened to me like 5 minutes into me buying Fallout 1st (well I got a free code for my first month just to try it out so I havent really spent my hard earned money on it I personally dont agree with Fallout 1st but nobody was giving it a fair chance so I figured if it's free I might as well) and after i bought it i went down to the Halloween event and before i knew it I had 5 people surrounding me with bats hitting me and doing the "trade" emote (the money one) and doing "thumbs down" emote so personally it's happened for me.
---
Tf does cod have to do with fo76
---
crashed 4 out of 6; not doing it any more.
---
Fallout 1st is soooooo good tho
---
Then let the game die. This has been the biggest disaster in Bethesda’s history and they have done irrepairable damage to their reputation already. Keeping this game alive will only dig their grave further. They have shown that they only care about money and their fanbase can go fuck itself.
---
I’d like to stop, but the pirate and fireman outfit call to me 😞
---
I don’t know how good I’m with RP, mostly i care too much about performance and vault raids, let me know if you will find more people i will be happy to join. I have couple characters main is heavy gunner, then unarmed junkies and stealth commando
---
I once shared an idea about healer build on another topic, but i'll repeat it here just to see if you're using it : 
---
To be sure you always have a way to heal others with your stims, staying hungry and losing hp's from it seems like a decent option to spam stimpackswithout waiting to get hit , and you eat soemthing like honey to fast travel.
---
Well if you report something as a bug then it goes into the trash bin. If you submit something that has to do with money you go to the bottom of the priority list.
---
The game was literally built for consoles and you have the audacity to blame the hardware.
---
but isn't he supposed to take sweets from you..? 
---
trick or treat right
---
Strength enough to type this,but not enough to deny I win. (In good fun lol)
---
You realize that entirely depends on your settings? The game barely takes 7 on low settings.
---
Fallout 1st guarantees no crashes... Yours for a low, low price!
---
You need multiple people with syringer
---
As I said, RAM usage jumps up to 13 GBs. That's when your console crash. Just because Bethesda said 8 gbs doesn't mean the game somehow magically adjust it's hardware demands
---
im also still hearing 9/11 was an inside job
---
It’s just kinda sad to see where Bethesda and the franchise has ended up. It’s a genuine shame. It weighs heavily. Recently played through F3 and FNV again. 
---
I’m fearful that they/we’ve fallen over a cliff we’ll never be able to re-climb. 
---
Sad times.
---
This is actually news to me, because I've read most of the Inside the Vaults and had to re-read a few to confirm what you said.  It turns out I missed this one because it was included on the basic announcement of the encore Meat Week, so you'll have to excuse a few others for missing it.
---
While I'm glad to be wrong that it hasn't been complete radio silence after all, the wording that text chat among a few other requested convenience features *"..are something we don’t currently have a timeline for but are looking into."* isn't exactly promising given the amount of time that has passed.
---
Hoe do you switch your settings to low on consoles?
---
Don't think so. I farm acid from flies all the time by myself
---
What kind of mods are you talking about ? i have a handmade having a criitcal hit every 2 shot if there's a way to reduce the AP cost of it i'd be impressed :D
---
"Bethesda recommends 8 gigs of ram" is not a reference to consoles. 
---
Swing and a miss there buddy
---
You can buy it from cap'n for like 30 caps
---
Maybe i have outdated informations plus i prefer to farm crickets in vault for acid just unlock reactor room and you have tons of acid
---
This game is not built for shiet consoles that can't even handle an event. People say their games crash 11 times out of 12. How the fuk is this game built for consoles?
---
Name one game on console that I can build and operate traps in (like Rust) I’ll try it! I’d include some video links but my post ratio can’t handle it haha 
---
Here a link to a polygon article about me with some video 
---
https://www.polygon.com/2019/10/7/20903297/fallout-76-love-hotel-trap-church-brahmin-death-bethesda
---
76 may be a mess but I’ve had a ton of fun and have an amazing group of people to play with. It offers a ton if you have a bit more imagination then looting and shooting. The Outer Worlds may be a great game but any world with no people in it sounds boring to me :)
---
Does it only jump in this event? I haven't played in a couple months and I never had a crashing issue back when I had 8GBs of RAM.
---
Sorry you're having issues with the event and it sounds like many others are as well. I've yet to crash during the event (knock on digital wood). XB1 (X model) here as well.
---
Exactly like the fridge.
---
These are facts
---
Crickets are good. I just perfer the sustainable income of acid. Everyone's got their own favorite acid grind tho.
---
It's your miss. Does consoles run the game on low settings? No. That's why I ask how the fuk do you switch to low settings
---
Bro the game was literally made for consoles then ported to pc. Did you seriously not know that? Haven't you wondered why the interface on pc is dogshit? It's a shoddy ported version. The consoles should have the best performance at default settings and have the biggest reason to complain when things go wrong.
---
Don’t hurt him he’s just vibin
---
I wish this was true, it would feed my traps really well haha
---
I’m saying you should on pay for what you can see at the time paying and make your judgments based on that fact, everything else is just hearsay.
---
It doesn’t matter if the developers say there will be 3 DLCs, all that matters is what you can see in front of you at time of release and every else that come true is just a bonus. If you don’t think the base game is worth $60 then don’t buy it silly.
---
yeah, I'm afraid that is what I'm telling. Let me be clear, I don't like any of those practices. But yes, I fear they have no financial choice but to continue this path.   
---
As for digging their grave further, that kinda feels like justice.
---
That's the point. The game needs to run perfectly by default on consoles because there is no customization. My pc runs the game just fine because I lowered the settings to match my hardware. Consoles can't do that so the game better run how it comes or they have every reason to complain.
---
Only some it 3x but I got the grim reaper cut out, the classic and vault boy cut out
---
Jumps up a bit on queen fights as well but whatever your experience is, 8gbs is nowhere near enough to run latest games
---
r/oddlyspecific but great description nonetheless
---
I have that mask. It's from the monster mash event at watoga highschool like others have said. I've had it in my inventory for months now. I believe it stayed in my inventory due to the game crashing while doing that event. It also auto equips when you load into a server but if you equip something else then it won't let you equip it again. The only way to equip it is to server hop
---
Fallout 5 Rehab Apocalypse
---
So basically aligned elements all reduce AP cost.
---
The equation is as follows: start with 100% AP cost on a balistic rifle that can be either auto or semi.
---
It has to be 3* with less VATS AP cost. That's 75% of base AP now.
---
Mod it to any automatic receiver: you're at 25%.
---
Dot sights, -10%, you're at 15%.
---
Aligned long barrel, swift magazine, forceful stock (3x -5%) and you're down to 0% of base cost per shot.
---
The only cost of using VATS will be first starting it with Q and then the time-related shrinking. You'll be able to shoot out dozens of magazines before you run out of AP.
---
Well whatever Bethesda planned for this game, it certainly doesn't look like consoles can take this game does it? I don't care what they said but games are crashing like hell for consoles now and you still say this game's built for consoles? You talking about next gen?
---
Loooool.  Please describe how you went about qualifying that and why you did it, while looking in the mirror.
---
You are backtracking hard now, how can you say "pay based on what you see" then say the dlc they promised was "just a bonus"? The advertised product needs to be delivered, they advertised 3 included dlc packs. A game with 3 included dlc packs is worth $60 to me so I paid. What's the excuse for cheating me?
---
Oh so you're saying the game must be toned down so that it can run on shit consoles? Just like they did with New vegas? where they had to butcher half the content so that console can run it? And you are demanding that on an online game that require constant update and more contents?
---
Ok i am impressed, i'll log in just to make test around this, thanks a lot :0
---
I know. Lot of the stuff is nice, but just cant get myself to pay with prices as they are now. Mostly buy when there are discounts.
---
Again man now I have a wear a shittier armor than you to carry my stuff around? Thats pay to win dude.
---
I logged on last night for the event, game froze a minute into it. Had to close the app. Relogged in and it froze again.  Another reboot. In the 1+ hour I spent online the game froze a total of 3 times. Completed the event 1 time and got a 1* piece of armor.
---
What is the most surprising to me is that people actually still defend them and these practices. I was so surprised when I found out people are actually buying the fucking subscription. I was absolutely sure people would have more awareness about the situation and would boycott the game immediately.
---
 There wasn’t even any statement from Bethesda trying to justify this blatant cash grab. Nope, they’re not even trying to hide it.
---
No.
---
Well what is it?
---
It was literally made for consoles. Why are you trying to argue that point?
---
Was with you til that last part. People are talking about outer worlds because it's the next closest thing to a Bethesda style rpg. It's fun and it's new and it's something to hold us over while Bethesda works on fixing this game.
---
If you meet an user by the name Giant_Key say him those thanks because he's the clever bastard that found this out
---
Free code? Where would someone find said code?
---
I get the feeling you have no idea how consoles work and how games get ported to different systems. Look it up.
---
It was working yesterday for me. I was getting wrecked by robots at mischief night and as soon as I stood still they were barely doing damage.
---
Throw a nade in the waterfall hole and it will jump down.
---
Same happens with mirelurk queens that refuse to emerge.
---
No it is not. Consoles can't run this game! It's like happy meal with sliced ghost pepper. It might be intended for children but no way a child's gonna be able to eat that thing
---
That's.. very interesting! I'll have to try and look into that!
---
The way I'm doing is eating stimpacks with the appropriate perks, though I *do* have a few Medic weapons as well that I rotate between depending on which ammo type I have available. But, I'd... totally have to look into doing that business with one of them!
---
Its one of the bugs that was neve solved? Seen that alot of times
---
As long as Zenimax's other studios are bringing in money, Bethesda won't fail.
---
Bethesda has a sponsor that lets them drink and gets them pills whenever they get too sick, and pays for more drinks.
---
I dont mind. Im happy.
---
Mayb they worry it become sex chat?
---
Hmm.. Interesting. I guess I will need to test this some more. What platform are you on?
---
Cheer!
---
Oh I do know how consoles work and I know they been out for 6 years and their specs weren't anything near decent even back then. And they are trying to run a poorly optimized game that was introduced in year 2018. I sure know how consoles work. It just doesn't work
---
PS4.
---
Yeah I'd love to help you get to the maximum efficiency of your niche and selfless playstyle
---
Yeah, for what possible reason could fans of the franchise who feel betrayed and robbed by 76 be excited for a release from a company who did a good job on new Vegas? 
---
Outer worlds is a relatively fast play through but it was actually fun, not a depressing junk grinding simulator that got old and started to feel tedious after level 50.
---
I’ve got 400+ “friends” on my list. Since Fallout 1st I’ve blocked 5 of them for verbal griefing. The practice has been that they join my server, ask me about F1 then go on a verbal tirade about me, my mom, my loved ones, etc. I simply unfriend and block them, go play on a public server for 30 minutes, then back to my private server. It’s nothing major, but there are players who enjoy over sharing their superiority complex.
---
I like idea! I don't think it's necessary or that I'll use it, but I like it!
---
There are a trillion and one different things that cause damage on-demand when you need it (Fire an Explosive weapon at the your feet being the most prominent when there's absolutely nothing else), but I do like that idea in theory and concept!
---
So all the console players deserve a refund?
---
Yeah. From Sony and Microsoft
---
It is on pc game pass (require win 10).
---
And often there are discounts for that.
---
Nope, those also crash. Joined a friends' private server, crashed also.
---
Hell yeah! Thank you for being one of the few people with a suggestion that isn't, "lolplaysomethingelsen00b"!
---
If you know of anybody that has a Medic's/VATS Cost weapon that'd be willing to sell it, I'd totally buy it in a heartbeat, and I'd be one of the few that would!
---
I havent had an issue with mischief nights (Pc) ran it 3 times yesterday
---
Switch 76 and NV, then put 3 at the back after the old ones as well, then you got mine
---
I hope Bethesda dies
---
Cheers to that 🍻
---
76 is gone its dead
---
A bug they fixed in 24 hours. How about the other 300+ days they lied about stash size being a server issue?
---
I must apologise, while I am not back tracking and was just trying to make my point heard. You were initially right, if a bit misguided and I didn’t pay attention.
---
You should either wait till it totally complete or pay for it in stage. In the case of fallout 76, that would be either to wait years from now till the point everything is released or to buy the base game and then pay the rest in instalments, like $13 a month. 
---
But if you don’t don’t like the base game, don’t buy it because that is the shape of the house the game is going to be and while it may look different in years to come it’s going to be the same.
---
Mind if i join you and praise your mom for raising a decent person? But seriously i need peeps to play with lol.
---
Me too! I use the gift emote to grab their attention to the bag and then I leave :)
---
Are you on pc?
---
Dude, why do you think we've got such shitty key bindings and stupid UI decisions? It was made for console controls, that's why the interface is so crap? A circle for weapon and actions? Yeah, that's the pc way....
---
Oof. Is the whitepowder jumpsuit still considered rare? I keep getting golf outfits and ranger hats... tf.
---
I think they bought it but since this sub is so toxic they are afraid to admit it. Evidenced by saying “after I bought it” right after explaining they didn’t.
---
Shill account ☝
---
I'm not seeing anything toxic going on on PS4, either.
---
If you two don't sort your shit out I'm going to turn this car around!
---
Or maybe it’s an indication that the only players left are the ones okay with the recent actions? I’m a day one player that put up with everything since launch and loved the game. Over 1300 hours put into the game. Hell, I’ve probably even bought more copies than anyone on this sub has bought of the game (5) and plenty of atoms. But 1st did make me break away entirely. I don’t blame the ones that are staying, it’s a fun game. But some of us just can’t anymore
---
Probably because a lot of issues posted here are just made up bullshit.
---
Do workshops force pacifist into pvp mode?
---
"The fixer" is available from 0 to 3 stars.
---
0 is either from a reward or crafted
---
1-3 from the purveyor, after you've learned the plan.
---
Well, yes. If everyone paid a subscription!
---
It just works!
---
I had a bug at the very beginning. I couldn't swap weapons in the weapon wheel or quick change weapons. I had to go into the inventory to swap the main weapon every time I wanted to change weapons. 
---
A quit and reloaded and everything started working. Hasn't happened since and haven't seen a bug yet.
---
I have it on two consoles on two accounts, the play through of the very first big mission had two very different outcomes. Holy shit, the dialog and actions you make playing the game can impact your story immensely.  Of all the criticism this game may have, they can't complain about the story.
---
Paid shill accounts made a couple of posts stating that they were getting attacked in game for being Fallout 1st members.
---
It's just a PR trick.
---
Yeah I did exactly the same thing, installed it to check it out, got bored after an hour so I packed it in and jumped on The Outer Worlds, glad I did, it's an awesome game.
---
Just uninstalled 76 for good this time, by the time wastelanders comes out it'll be a short wait for CP2077, I'm sure something will tide me over until then.
---
You say that as if there was anything else to do
---
true, i know how you feel
---
i once had a player dropping paper bags at my house and it was all legendaries 
---
fallout 76 community is so nice
---
Makes sense.
---
Just because the game's designed for consoles doesn't mean it's made to work on consoles
---
Ive noticed it only uses normal stims. So check and see if you have any left
---
Same, I have maybe crashed one time out of twenty times I've done the event on my base PS4. During the event; I've bluescreened an additional four or five times while fast traveling **away** after the credits rolled. No idea what's causing that, but it's only a minor inconvenience. I haven't lost any rewards or loot due to that.
---
Sure! Feel free to add me IGN: jims1973
---
Feel free to join my server whenever you see me on... though through this Halloween event week, I’ll primarily be doing said event.
---
So you don't support independent developers? Tell me do you work for a company? do you have a job at all? If you take a paycheck from a company right now then you're a huge hypocrite having this mentality. Of course they're going to take a fucking check. They deserve it too they're one of the few developers left actually give a fuck about their customers.
---
It doesn't have game breaking bugs fallout 76 is a way shity your game based on launch alone. Are you seriously saying here that people are favouring it just because? Grow up dude.
---
&gt; So buying multiple fo76 games to run mules for larger stash is also pay to win, 
---
The very definition of pay2win.
---
Also you're thinking far too small scale. It isn't just getting around stash limitations. It also gets around max cap limits, max vendor caps per day, max scrip per day, multiple active camps to farm resource nodes, multiple vendor camps or just a separate vendor camp and home camp if you're into such things.
---
Why do you think these people purchase a mule account? Why do you think some people even purchase more than one? They're paying for more advantage over a regular person who has only purchased one copy of the game.
---
Granted, it's not something Bethesda explicitly introduced as a pay2win thing. However, since it brings in the money and it's very hard to police anyhow, people get away with it.
---
Oh nifty!
---
I did not know this.
---
I couldnt rationalize subscribing to fo1st. Ive been playing since the beta and really want it to be a good game, but im not going to start paying for a private server (thats probally just the ones from survival) in hopes that the game will run the way its supposed to. Ive played on the private servers and the bugs and bs are still there. Except now you get to pay monthly for it. At least i wont feel bad about moving on to the next game.
---
After a quick nap at work I'm back so anyways,
---
Scrapboxes are very convenient, they're a good place to dump all your stuff in no doubt, I like them.
---
I just don't like how you have to pay for it, because it is an advantage over the player who doesn't splash the cash
---
I had a flicking regular ghoul walking straight up into the sky from where I killed him in the WS carpark.
---
Hey. I just made [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpkmz1/is_the_sentinel_effect_bugged/), as I am lately taking more damage than usual. Maybe its something else entirely.
---
I retreated back to fo4 after it got boring.
---
Yeah I still have it.
---
What were you expecting?
---
The best kind of correct
---
r/whooshed
---
If you have an audio recording app on your smartphone and if you have an iPhone, you do, record the music while you’re in the Atomic Shop, so when Bethesda removes it, you’ll have it saved on your phone 📲🎼🎧
---
Yeah perhaps. But if zenimax dosnt see it as profitable they're as liable to asset strip and prune the dead wood as any other holding company. We don't necessarily want/need to have Beth fail, but we need to stop enabling its success to effect any changes.
---
Rich parents who don't care?
---
Same here but being lvl 366 helps lol
---
Bethesda created Zenimax, so I doubt that will ever happen.
---
Keep praying...
---
Pay to win what?
---
Seems our opinions differ )
---
There are solutions even to extreme circumstances without situational convenience elements.  
---
Be well fellow Wastelander
---
The trip wire works fine for me, what isn’t it doing? I would really like to use the counter but it doesn’t work at all :(
---
That's easily remedied: they should make the nuka/quantum cola and the BOS PA paints count as well to make the 'P2W!' crybabies run out of steam.
---
Should have reported him, homophobic slurs are auto ban by Ms and BES. Not to mention it's 2019 and as a society we have moved beyond that bullshit.
---
Sell your account off to someone else perhaps. So others can use your account instead. Recycle the account and get some money back
---
He got me too, he posts on lfg and then camp kills anyone that buys from him with mines. I screen capped the name and go out of my way to nuke him everytime I can.
---
I've not played for few days, but now I played for some hours and ended up doing the event for few times, maybe 4-7. 
---
It seemed to work all times. One time I had difficulty getting the quest info to show up to know what to do next, but I kept selecting and unselecting the quest until the quest info on right side of HUD showed up.
---
Playing on PC. I did have one freeze at the start of my session but I put it off for installing many new mods.
---
No I didnt buy it at all, I'd never be "afriad" to admit anything theres nothing to be "afraid"of apart from a few 12 year olds, I had a free code for £10 from xbox rewards and £2 left over from years ago back when I used the Microsoft cards as a kid left over on my account since now I pay with my card, so I used that to get the code which is my eyes is free since I never worked for that money it was literally just handed to me from xbox.
---
I'm on Xbox One
---
Does the event start at the top of every hour like meat week?
---
I was targeted once and only once, I at first gotten a message from someone calling me a piece of a shit, he then tried to mini nuke my house, until I sniped him, told him to back off and let me enjoy the game he tried to do it again, and I left the server, other than that players have either been completely neutral or friendly any toxicity after was the same type you'd always find trying to cause as much harm as they could to everyone not just me because of my fallout 1st status
---
Have an upvote for bravery!
---
They don't care about non subcription members and more so for those who complain.
---
If you aint 1st you're last
---
About 180 !
---
:D people need to enjoy the holidays
---
&gt;To be fair it's not like they're giving us any more communication than usual.
---
The fallacy of relative privation. Just because the thing you're comparing to it is equally bad or worse, doesn't make the original thing any better by comparison. It's still bad.
---
&gt; There's always this myth that Bethesda is super talkative to this reddit that I never understand. 
---
That's just false. I've been around since the early days of this sub and this is the very first time I've ever seen make mention that Bethesda ever was super talkative. Much like the previous fallacy, they're communicating even less now but it doesn't make their lack of communication before any better.
---
The thing I don't understand is why are you trying to defend Bethesda for their lack of communication? It's objectively and provably clear that their communication has been severely lacking. Bethesda even made a post about it close to a year ago now addressing their own lack of communication and made a commitment to communicate more in future.
---
Come on dude, see the situation for what it is, not what you may like it to be. They're communication is very poor. Please don't make excuses for them.
---
Hey. It is not level locked and you can get the plasmas at any level
---
No Man's Sky recovered from Sean having a vacation with Elvis a Tupac, silence can a does work when people are outraged.
---
See its the total opposite for me.  Just changed my sneak rifleman into a power armored rifleman and I'm feeling like a god with the medic torso on. Haven't died since the switch
---
I’ve done it now a total of 6 times with 1 crash and disconnect.  On PS4.  
---
It was laggy but what else is new
---
Most veterans just stick to trading and farming queen, there is no other endgame.
---
Xbox pass for xbox or pc, first month 1$ (outer worlds is free with that pass)
---
I’m saying you aren’t that bright. All it takes is a quick look at the pr reps accounts or at the Bethesda replied tags. Are you new here?
---
The guys who created it don't appear to have controling interest in it any more, so they're at the mercy of the other stakeholders. unless it's like that bit in batman where Bruce Wayne secretly buys back his controlling majority....
---
But yeah, I guess your right. The two have been linked from the start and Beth's shittyness dosnt have any bearing on the other studios they own. Maybe that's why the games have been getting worse over time. Maybe Todd is secretly fighting crime at night?
---
You're not wrong about the fixer having a low drop rate. I haven't received one yet and I've had the plan for a long time.
---
Jet packs are still bugged 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Bethesda can’t account for your crappy internet if you live in middle of nowhere with old infrastructure (might not affect you but this is the case for some. Issue is out of anyone’s control)
---
You don’t have to go full auto on the handmade. Gives a larger ammo capacity than a lever
---
On reddit, yes. In game, not even close. Only griefing I've experienced were two random assholes at Whitespring station just throwing nuke mines everywhere, one of them followed me until I left cause I told them both to screw off and leave the level 25 alone.
---
Regarding reactions to Fallout 1st members...Whitespring station is now a hot spot for people to gather and do the dance emote, and others stand and watch or crouch up and down to dance along. Yesterday, I went to someone's camp who had a whole ass Mothman church, and they were home. Went up front, started doing the Mothman dance, and was spammed with heart emotes. Best reaction I've gotten so far haha
---
so the state of gaming has gone from "dont preorder" to "dont trust a goddam word any company says about what the game includes and just wait a couple years to see how it plays out". I take that to mean you never order anything current? you only play vetted games that have been out for a few years? I think you are the misguided one, and incredibly condescending with your 20/20 hindsight advice.
---
Next shift should be coming in soon. Lol
---
While I don't agree with current monetization scheme, events described by you seem like a gross over-exaggeration. Been PvP-ing daily, have all those AoE mutatios; never seen a single person trying to trigger it and maybe once in last 6 months seen someone shooting random dudes at station. Maybe I'm just lucky (or unlucky, fot that matter). Oh, and playing on PC.
---
He's only showing the chainsaw and not using it in whitesprings, using it would be suicide, that thing can't kill a rad rat let alone ghouls in there.
---
2 measly damage and the mods don't work for it, seriously the chainsaw needs some care and consideration Bethesda.
---
It sounds and looks bad ass but the dmg credentials don't match
---
Thats not why I bought it. Havnt used my private server once yet.
---
Yeah I doubt this happens no one cares if you use FO1st nice try.
---
Raids and daily scrip. Queen is not as good since they removed mutation recipes. At least we get repair kits lol
---
The fact of the matter is people are using this as ammo to say that there is only attention to fallout 1st subscribers. A completely false narrative, and though yes. Communication is very minimal they are still doing vastly better than at the beginning when they only put out patch notes. 
---
They started the inside the vault newsletter and put explanations in their patch notes, and they're pretty good at responding to the high, game breaking issues in the game. Even if they don't talk as much as everyone would like, but to be fair their development is pretty singular with how long updates and new content comes out so there's not so much to talk about.
---
All of that isn't even the point because again the point of my comment is to dismiss the false equivalency of them "only being concerned with fallout 1st" when literally nothing has changed.
---
👀
---
Yeah those we’re the ones i mostly do and forgot raids since i never do it. xd
---
Crashed 1 event on private server. Done a lot of events 2-3/h
---
No. I've seen people who just hang out in their camp behind locked doors roleplaying a  wasteland homeowner. They're the only ones getting into heaven.
---
I LIKE SCRAP BOXES. MAKE ME GOOD AND STRONG. MANY 5.56. CHANGE MY MIND
---
Ye, same tbh lol
---
All but the pirate costume have dropped for me so far, though I do have a pirate costume cause I bought it off someone last night
---
Gotta hope that big wendigo from wastelanders is another ”end game” boss or there will still be nothing more to do.
---
And people still bought it though
---
yes. you dont even have to be the one who claimed the workshop.
---
A player with pacifist on could be walking past a workshop thats unclaimed, and another character can start claiming the workshop then turn and shoot the other player in the borders of the workshop and take all their dropped junk. Literally all it takes is putting one foot into a workshop zone and you are a potential target.
---
Yep. It's not the communtiy reps fault that Fallout 1st exists so why take it out on them?
---
I was referring to him posting a picture wearing a mask that came with a purchased atoms bundle, considering the hysteria regarding perceived support of Bethesda by paying ‘extra’.
---
I used to be in a cancerous fb group, got banned for opposing the overmonetization, but before I got banned lol i saw a ton of people say they got the year. Maybe the people on this sub are smarter than the morons and shills in that group were.
---
There are isolated moments of great storytelling in FO4. In fact, there are probably hundreds of small moments that make the game worth playing. Just don't go into it expecting the main quest to make sense or even be "gud." For that you will need mods.
---
Well I thought it was the ”Interloper” first time I saw it... So got a but disappointed.
---
They didn't "lie". They're still a company. What they did was absolutely awful with paying for space, but it makes sense from a greedy corporation and in no way means they lied.
---
If the server is overloaded, and they made the server like 2% more efficient. Great everyone can have 8 extra carry weight. OR we can sell it and only 1% of the people will get it so they can get EIGHTHUNDRED carry weight!
---
It's dumb, it's ridiculous, but as a developer I do believe they have server issues regarding more space.
---
Urban is grey and forest is green.
---
I think assassin and sentinel sets works together, if you have a complete set, or work  the 10 damage reducción offert or Nothing works any. 
---
75 posibility effect work, you Can think if you have a complete set about 7 effect works pero hits, but not, if you recibe 4 hit, in 3 works the 10 effect and in one o
---
Sorry for my inglish
---
Green? Is there green mask rly?
---
Is there a link to what these outfits look like
---
and LCK didnt affect drop rate?

They are basically copy and pasting ESO's subscription system with a few changes so at least a few deals will probably come.
---
"Shareholders" obviously came out before "Wastelanders".
---
How you explain this then.
---

---
It does not... Of course very hard to prove that for sure as we don't know what happens server side. But there is nothing in the datamine about it
---
I hope this thread doesn't turn into Evey other one I just wanted to say happy Halloween and enjoy :)
---
Since they are copying ESO's subscription model hopefully they also copy the amount of content ESO produces and their no pay2win store.
---
Your support, time, and money allows them to continue giving you broken shit that they dont care frustrates you
---
Little griefing because all the trolls quit because of the lack of updates/content.
---
This is a good time to leave the game if you’re not planning on getting ripped off a second time after purchasing beta at full price...  and yeah, paying for beta WAS a complete ripoff compared to playable hours (not days) and progress in achievements NOT counting after launch - what a great way to thank  PAYING beta testing customers... 
---
they have not been able to correct gamebreaking bugs since release, even reintroduced quite a few, never really took care of the duping until it was way too late and game economy was broken... and now the limited bugfixing will be focused on FO1st. Any hope for improvement has been shot down on several occasions from Bethesda - so if you’re unhappy now, it will never improve...
---
Only need to press uninstall for my excorcism to be complete... and I’ll be free from this evil and wrongdoing
---
My routine: get daily and weekly free atoms, do daily quests (usually to try and level up for the daily level up atom challenge), craft a fuckton of ammo, restock vendors (+ mutation serums if running low).
---
I remake my camp every couple of weeks max.
---
So yeah it's light on end game.
---
What? I’m curious now
---
You can mod them in the armor workbench to have the opposite color.
---
I can it about I times over a couple of days. One time it was so slow it timed out and failed while everybody had been sitting in the courtyard for 8 minutes. We were all pissed but I jumped to a different server the next time.
---
Maybe is connected to the bug that bethesda introduced with the last update? Forest armor in pip boy is visually showing as urban, although when you wear it is forest camo...
---
Stash is not the same as the scrap box *at all*, I can't believe people still don't get this. Scrap and junk are set items with the same property every time, but the stash contain items that have several different independent values, each. Like, 1 weapon has a condition, a full set of specific mods, with up to three or more legendary prefixes, which all contributes to stat changes on the weapon. This also probably a calculation the game has to pull out every time you decide to look at the stats for a weapon (because the 250DR bug would probably not exist if the weapon had "static" stats). Like, how much does your game lag when scrolling through weapon stash compared to when scrolling through junk? Now, imagine multiplying that by a 100. It *is* server related issues which caps our stash space. I guess they could give unlimited scrap to everyone, but to me it feels fair to pay a price to boost your character if you play the game *a lot*
---
I wonder if the option to remove paint still shows when you attempt to mod the mask at a bench. Used to change the color but name stayed the same.
---
Urban lets your wear a helmet with it, Forest doesn't. Because reasons.
---
Weird, maybe try asking support
---
A register can have a value of 20 or a value of 400, the processing power and written storage size to handle that register doesn't change.
---
It just works
---
*shrug* 
---
Urban is meant to be grey, and forest green. I don't have to explain  anything.
---
I think that's only the preview that's bugged since patch #14 (also applies to some other scout armor pieces, IIRC). When you actually equip them, they should be the right color.
---
This game tears my heart to pieces with the little things, the mechanics, the community. Then destroys my soul with the bugs, glitches and Subscription rape.
---
drinking some water, then a nuka cola seems to crash mine

---
More details if they matter. I don't know this is intended behavior, but the previous NW xp challenge was cumulative, following the 250/500/1500/2500 format. When you completed the "earn 500 xp" challenge, you'd start the next challenge "earn 1500 xp" at 500 out of 1500 xp earned. So, to get the next reward, you had to earn 1000 xp. The current set of challenges are completely resetting between challenges. I just started the "earn 1500 xp challenge at 0, instead of 500.
---
You're right, that is what I meant
---
This is something on server side, i had 8-9 crashes today and only 1-2 yesterday
---
Only reason I can see is ppl doing queen for repair kits. But thats just part of my playstyle so cant say how it is for other ppl. Scrap kit makes no sense since most ppl are struggling with inventory space already.
---
Because I wanted to buy 1650 atoms... Since they are valued at 16,5 euros and I paied 15 euros I got a private server and infinite stash a tent and a costume... And I just wanted the atoms.... sooo will buy again when I need more atoms.
---
Aaa, two nukes?
---
Came here to say this just about word for word. I used to play on Xbox but I quit because it’s so damn framey I cant aim at all
---
It sort of does, the implication is that these people can't control themselves somehow. That's always been my interpretation anyway.
---
have to try this one out, haven't heard that before :D
---
I haven't experienced any retaliation at all.  Thought I would, so I stayed on my toes just in case, but nothing - not even any nasty comments.
---
Mischief Night had 0 crashes during event and run 2 within 15mins usually, and Fallout 1st came out earlier then Halloween event so those players with those issues waited longer then people saying they are crashing during events.
---
If you get staggered, it counts as moving. Then takes a second of being still to re-register as still.
---
Dang that sucks, assuming regular Xbox One? Using Xbox X and had 0 crashes and been running event sometimes twice within 15mins.
---
Good for you no one cares and you will be back
---
exactly.  wtf kind of hyperbole is calling it "class war" over a measly 10 bucks a month?
---
You can blueprint the workshop so that it can be easily placed next time
---
Okay so this is the difference, not the color.
---
Maybe OP is referring to the nukes?
---
I have seen explosive ultracide laser rifles, so it may be possible they exist but have never been duped like the more popular versions because they aren't as good.
---
&gt;DONT MAKE WASTELANDERS PAY TO PLAY,
---
Lmfao, shit posting keeps getting shittier on here
---
They are.
---
If you cry loud enough that you are a victim?  There simply is no need for proof or evidence...any attempts to question or request proof are met with outlandish emotional outbursts, accusatory fraudulent statements, flat out lies and subterfuge.  Its embarrassingly sad and hilarious at the same time.
---
I've ran it 15-20 times now. There are some servers that are much slower than others for things like the fires lighting. It's not common though. I've maybe run into it 2 times.
---
But knowing this, I've come up with a little strategy that helps me dbl dip a bit. If I'm in a particularly fast group, at the end of the event, directly after receiving the awards, I'll jump servers.
---
I've hit the event in progress twice now, but only just started trying that last night.
---
Only issue with this though is that people need to play tough love and stop supporting said friend. In this case people need to boycott the game, or at least any more purchases.
---
But I have friends who are "Proud Fallout 1st Members", so I don't think that'll change. People will still buy the pass and encourage the behavior, just like someone buying that friend drinks.
---
It's not just PR and marketing. 
---
The whole software is inadequate. The Servers can't handle when "too much" is going on.
---
The Sandbox gameplay is too limited, the software and the fact that public servers can't handle are one reason.
---
The Game lacks interesting late game content.
---
The game lacks obligatory features for a MMO like text chat.
---
Do you know who sells plans / mods for urban scout masks to make color different? because i cannot change it without them.
---
Buh-bye
---
“Shitty” is a relative term. You just lost.
---
I've been on the server when WS was nuked and we tried to finish the event - we failed, since all were in PAs or Hazmat suits and none wears costume and masks, so the progress was too slow. I didn't even know you can fail at this event...
---
"but Bethesda please stop thinking only about money"  
---
Haha.
---
Agreed they need to stop going overkill in building restrictions as they only hurt us and especially with restrictions around stairs.
---
Try a variation on the 'rug glitch'. Put down a foundation (for a flat surface), build a stash box on the foundation, build a small rug close to the box, blueprint the rug and box (not the foundation), build the blueprint near where you want to place the box, then use the rug to 'slide' the box into place.
---
1 is still blue (forest color) and 1 is still urban when i wear them.
---
That's funny... A lot people said same to me. I still didn't came back. This game is just dull even for survival game. Not even saying what bethesda is doing right now.
---
I dont see how you can grief anyone when you can literally turn PvP off and they can't hurt you at all
---
yep, its usually eating or drinking more than two of the same item consecutively.
---
Your on pc right?
---
Well, did this a couple of times. Then I found a better way, give players an ultimatum, swap server or rebuild your camp 😁
---
Only trolls?
---
It seems like only troll would continue to play since trolling is "emergent content"
---
Yeah i thought the same, but it's not like that.
---
Yet you can't let go enough to leave the subreddit eh?
---
Yeah no, how about we just add instant respecing for a fee either caps or scrip. If it was just for FO1st that'd be wrong.
---
Their goons will downvote any criticism under their comments anyways
---
I can’t imagine what their internal dialogue on this subject must be like. They’re ignoring all of the backlash entirely. That can’t sit right with the developers, unless none of them give a single shit anymore and just see this as a job. I’m sure management has put a complete gag order on everyone there when it comes to answering the community on why they’re going back on everything and just focusing on the money grab.
---
r/Im14andthisiswoosh
---
I’ve also noticed this increase in damage. High level enemies, especially Warlords and gutsys, have been tearing through my health lately, never really had a problem with them before.
---
I nuke the event with my premium icon, making sure they know the war is on 😂
---
Im just sitting here for 2 reasons.
---
1. I like watch shitstorm that happens every time that bethesta announces another *features*
---
2. I simply forgot to leave this sub but after some time i decided to go to 1st point.
---
Interesting. Do you use sentinel armors?
---
Also I beleive they are too lazy to get on here and respond. Much like any other job in america I beleive work demands have increased and Bethesda is riding on the success of skyrim still. I don't want to hear this shot about the dev's working long hours. Do your fucking job and stop fucking the community that got you your success in the first place
---
So your idea is to just piss everyone off? Bravo
---
Unsure, but you can wear the uniform and a mask or hat and it'll count as you wearing a costume! Like the skeleton mask, any Fasnacht mask, witch hat, clown hat, and apparently the tinfoil hat
---
Yeah. It’s just happening in last few days
---
Bye!
---
Honestly, I more blame zenimax than I do bethesda, cause yes bethesda is the one promising us this stuff but zenimax (as far as I know) is in charge of financials and shit
---
So they might have pushed for more microtransactions and other ways to make revenue
---
Agreed we need Team Exp gain, tired of having tag everything instead of fighting as a team.
---
You're right, I had a complete brain fart about the weapon and food condition stuff.
---
Seems they don’t care about playerbase. Players would like BoS things or original costumes and they would pay for them? 
---
Nah, just add some s****y weapons skin and an orange t-shirt with nuka cola logo
---
&gt;The fact of the matter is people are using this as ammo to say that there is only attention to fallout 1st subscribers.  
---
&gt; All of that isn't even the point because again the point of my comment is to dismiss the false equivalency of them "only being concerned with fallout 1st" when literally nothing has changed. There's no bias. 
---
It's actually compelling though. One of the posts about today's issue got the first response I've seen from Bethesda since the whole Fallout 1st thing dropped. It was two comments. One to say that they're looking into it and another saying that the problem resolved. 
---
It's an issue in of itself because it's the first thing that Bethesda has responded to since Fallout 1st dropped (no pun intended). What is worse though, the time difference between the two comments was 30 minutes.
---
Check it out yourself - [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpclks/fallout\_1st\_broke/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpclks/fallout_1st_broke/)
---
How many problems do you know were resolved by Bethesda that quickly? To be fair to Bethesda it might have been a real small thing but it's terrible optics all round.
---
&gt; they're pretty good at responding to the high, game breaking issues in the game 
---
That's also provably false. There are numerous examples but one that comes to mind is the Power Armour freezing bug. The real kicker is this came from a rework of the power armour system, something that no one had an issue with prior, no one had requested and added no additional functionality. Rather than roll back the patch and return us back to what was perfectly functional, we had to live with that issue for months before it was resolved.
---
Some things have generally had a full day turnaround for a hotfix. Very few if any within the same day, let alone 30 mins.
---
These situations are not ammunition. They're evidence of failure. I'm not using this as ammo to attack Bethesda for the sake of it. I just see the evidence for what it is.
---
Because The Outer Worlds does things better than what Bethesda offers currently.
---
I thought by buying FO76 I was getting FO4 game I could play with my brother and son, getting to experience it together at the same time.
---
What we got was something much different, not even a GTA5 Online experience, which by the way is better. Graphics were shit, bugs fucking everywhere, no story, no where to call home, nothing of what I was expecting.
---
The Outer Worlds is very story driven, and while it doesn't offer this huge world to explore and do things off to the side, you get a great story that you have control over. This is no longer the core of Bethesda games, the stories seem like they are tacked on and lack any weight and no cohesion.
---
I have fallen out of love for all things Fallout and TES to a lesser degree. Its a shell of its former self and Bethesda has gone the way of EA and Activision and when Cyberpunk 2077 releases, I think people will have a harder time buying into the next TES or FO game especially how Bethesda has been doing business lately.
---
With Todd Howard at the helm, I don't think we will ever get a game on par with New Vegas as far as story is concerned as MTX will be their driving motivation as they will want to monetize every aspect of their games.
---
So I will watch this dumpster fire as long as Bethesda keeps fucking up because it is entertaining because instead of putting the fire out, they keep feeding it and the people that keep defending and buying into it are just as responsible.
---
If you go on the market sub there's plenty of people selling them, with pictures!
---
It's not for you to decide what games other people like.  Clearly, some people like the game enough to pay a subscription.  People like you are dicks.  You're ruining these other people's experiences.
---
I agree that the prices of atomic shop items skew their data if they're trying to use that data to determine what people want more of.
---
I disagree that prices are too high in general, which is what people tend to latch on to. People complain about prices being too high because it's something they want but they don't want to pay that much for it. That's economics! You may value an item, but it's price may be higher than the value you hold it to - that simply means you don't buy it. There are always so many comments like "oh, they'd make sooo much more money if they just cut the prices in half, so many more people would buy it!" The fuck they would! If they would make more money at a different price point, you bet your ass it would be sold at that price point instead lol. Bethesda has the data, these people who seem to struggle to cope with the value they attach to their own money and purchases do not. Prices are set to make money.
---
How much are they going for atm🤔?
---
Ill just stick with my pirate costume them dont wanna miss out in special items!
---
It is but you have to be in the Event area when it goes off or you don't get credit. Go on now try it.
---
You can buy the plans for the scout armour and mods in the Enclave bunker near whitesprings
---
&gt; Their goons will downvote any criticism under their comments anyways 
---
Awfully prescient given the amount of downvoting already occurring.
---
It's not an unreasonable request to have them talk to us like people. Let's see if it has any traction.
---
Unsure of the current value, as the event is still ongoing, but I paid 20k cause I don't like being close to max caps, and I just wanted to go ahead and complete my set of outfits from the event
---
I love how every person who quits any game pretends they want to "watch the shitstorm" instead of admitting they still care enough to have hope for the game.
---
You're all the same lol.
---
Nobody buys that crap.
---
Never really had a problem with anything like this. You sure it’s not anything on your end?
---
I feel that! Just bought the pirate costume last night, it looks so badass 😩
---
exactly, thank you!  also daily reminder that hunter/hunted is a thing.
---
Yeah but havent seen plans / mods there which paints those
---
I do first event 00 on adventure then 2 events on private (solo)
---
I agree very nice drawings loved the vids in Fallout 4 explaining the special stats
---
 Tramell Ray Isaac was the artist that was originally responsible for drawing the first Vault Boys. IIRC, someone else gave him some concept art for it and he just finalized it.
---
Hello, 
---
I can confirm, this was me. X 
---
I have video evidence mixer.com/at0m_bomb_baby
---
Get a mic
---
I’ve only got two pieces but even so, definitely feels like there’s been a damage buff.
---
I'm also on ps4 but I've had no issues. I know you probably already checked but how is your internet connection?
---
According to the list I found, it counts.
---
NW was never going to be hacker free, Fortnite has hackers and they have to go hard after them while harder with patches all costing money and Fallout 76 is so small in terms of player bases it would never be able to compete with hackers let alone with the team in charge of it now as seen by many bugs we have in game on day one.
---
fyi, u dont have to listen to the hunter/hunted station!  if u turn it on, wait for the mission prompt to flash on screen, then u can turn  off radio station.  (just make sure the mission is marked in ur pip boy) and voila!
---
You can stash junk before PvP right now. You are literally asking a stupid question because anyone can stash junk before PVP. And they can avoid PVP without a subscription.
---
Not at all. If I would see a chance that the game could live on without being shady like with the atomic stuff or Fo1st i wouldnt even think about subs. I would be happy that the game is progressing forward but this picture looks further away with every patch.
---
I wouldn't be totally surprised if there were some kind of seeded RNG for this as well. Seems like the people getting any of the 4 rare outfits continue to get those more often. I only had about 4 pumpkin plans before I started getting repeats for the next 3 times after that. Only decent reward I got so far was the fireman costume but that was from the good reward list and not the actual rare costumes list.
---
I love fallout 76 and in my honest opinion, I would happily pay for a full subscription service if they fixed the game, I mean all the monstrosities that they have left un fixed. I really want this game to last and it’s actually really depressing it’s being left in the dirt as a cash grab. I believe it could get better because nothing is impossible, they need to get their shit together and stop making horrible decisions. 
---
Fallout 76 is loved by so many of the community, I’m literally begging Bethesda just to come out and explain what the hell is going on. There have been many games that have had a shitty first year like sea of thieves, no mans sky to name a couple, that have made unexpected comebacks. 
---
Obviously I’m probably wasting my time imagining a Fallout 76 comeback but dam, it’s good to dream a little.
---
I quit the game, but I have decided to lurk in the hopes of seeing some good news. Also I occasionally see a few new players questions I can help answer.
---
I don't know why, but "pumpkin Fasnacht" has me cracking up
---
Besides the color, one can be worn with a helmet, the other can't. Don't remember which is which, sorry.
---
I've been playing it on PS4. Had enemies straight up vanish during a fight - not killed, just gone - and corpses despawn before being looted. I also fairly regularly get what I'd call a bug where I get the sound effect for the loot window opening, but I never actually get to *see* the loot window. And the corpse becomes unlootable immediately after.
---
They're certainly not game breaking bugs, but they are bugs and they do exist.
---
xp &amp; plans compadre!
---
I think the drop rate is the same as any other weapon.  I’ve received several, including a J25.
---
You can wear helmet with urban one for sure. Just tested it out.
---
Take off the helmets and wear masks. We did a nuked mischief night yesterday afternoon and knocked it out with like 5 minutes to spare.
---
But yeah, thank you for answering. This is the difference between those.
---
Other people deserve to know how bad it is.
---
I was pretty careful with my math, but I could be wrong.  The quests in the first image were closer to a 0.025% chance for a scout mask, but at this level of magnitude, it's kind of just splitting hairs, honestly.
---
The Veil of Secrets is a guaranteed drop from the quest, but you also get a "grab bag" that picks from an *enormous* list of possible items, including the scout masks.
---
Also, I didn't notice that you asked about the plasma grenade plan. That one has a 0.058 to drop in ash heap events only. The rumor that it can drop from explosive boxes is 100% false, based on a miscommunication about the ***pulse*** grenade planplan.
---
😴
---
It's cliche but user name checks out
---
It's tough to believe that u/literally_the_satan isn't trying to piss people off and cause general chaos.
---
Hi 14, and hello woosh. I'm dad.
---
Come on dude, that's not helpful. I get where you're coming from but it's exactly this kind of comment that would put someone off from talking to us.
---
War never changes.

I'll never pay for subscription for any game - no matter how good it is. It's not that I cannot afford it - I paid for the game when I bought it, they've taken my money in advance and gave me a game, that even after whole year on the market, is still a bug fest. Why should I believe that another money from me will make any difference? It'll only show this greedy company that no matter how shitty game become, they still can count on players to give them more money...
---
Classy playlist for a spooky day!
---
If this is your first FO game, I would recommend trying some of the older games before making a judgment. FO76 is fundamentally different how it's balanced because it's supposed to be a multiplayer version of FO4. Be aware though that FO1 &amp; 2 are top down isometric games with turn based combat and not first person on the fly combat, so the play style is different. Tatics is also top-down isometric and more of a party-based tactical game and, well, we just don't talk about Brotherhood. FO3 &amp; 4 are more first-person-shooter-y, with 4 being more of that than 3.
---
What happens to the stuff in your stash when first runs out?
---
I'm just missing the long suit. Still need 3 or 4 of the pumpkin plans.
---
Because people had the ability to stash their junk even before the scrap boxes??? You're just reaching at this point, honestly
---
It'd be nice if an actual show comes out of this.
---
No, it's like finding out your loved one only pretended to like you for the last 30 years but they were really just in it for the money, and now I can't find my sweetroll.
---
I'm not dumb, I understand how a for-profit company operates, but this is almost epically bad customer service (pun intended).
---
So true my friend.
---
Thank you! :)
---
Its not a purse, its a satchel.  Indiana Jones had one.
---
Its a PURSE, OKAYYYYYY?!
---
Anyway, a side bag is probly not in the cards.  The regular backpack clips and that just sort of floats behind you.  Imagine if they had to make something that meshed with the torso and arm?  Thats probly a little too advanced for the Austin team.
---
This is what most won't admit to for some reason.  That they still care enough to have hope.
---
Why would you buy it?  Its a random drop for the event!  Im just waiting for the hat to drop.  I do love it!
---
Outer worlds is actually fun... Unlike some other poorly managed games.
---
Basically, the Parent Company perk card. It's like chem resistant and party boy/girl, all in one.
---
Oh there is a list?  Do you by chance have a link?
---
I love how redit thinks it's Bethesda's entire fan base. All these topics crying out listen to us, we're being ignored, yet every camp I go to has a Scrap Box. Seems to me they are listening to their fans, just not redit rage.
---
Crashing peoples game with strangler armor, a be Gatling plasma and a wire base all at once.
---
Stays there, just cant add more, but can use it
---
Let's be honest, FO4's story is absolute crap for an open world game like FO4 wants to be.
---
Cause I was almost max caps and I'm impatient 😅 already had all the other outfits, just needed the pirate costume to complete everything! If you're on Xbox and you don't get the hat while the event is going on for the next few days, I got an extra hat!
---
You're thinking too much like a role player. Just buy the subscription for that full satisfied feeling of giving other people your money.
---
Private servers are not a DLC and were never stated to be free.
---
Here's what to do: buy Fallout 1st then complain watch it get patched in 2 days
---
Here it is (not my fault it is formatted so poorly):

EDIT: Formatted a bit better, highly recommend just Ctrl+Fing through this to see if what you want is there. Also note, some of these might not be in the game, like the Piper/Cait outfits.”
---
Congratulations, you have ascended.
---
I've only played it twice worked fine 1st time aside from lag but then I got the bug that won't respawn you
---
I had been wondering what the refund policy would be if they kill the game in June and people have paid for 12 months of FU1st.
---
Done 11 times, no issues for me on PC. But I have seen many of friends having some/a lot
---
You cant oneshot anybody above like lvl 25. The 110 dmg is in adventure mode
---
Has never crashed for me, not once.
---
Wait, need to dust off my crystal ball...
---
Name something that people are making up, I haven't seen anything that doesn't warrant complaint....
---
Oh I definitely care. I rarely get invested in things enough to get angry unless I care about it. I'm a bit worn out of 76 and i am disappointed in some of the recent decisions but I still want to have access to a fun, stable and successful multi player fallout game. I have always wanted 76 to be a big living world, where things matter and the world changes depending on player interaction. For example I was hyped for clean Appalachia, I love the idea that we as players have pa ed the way for a new world state where the scorched were driven back and a new big bad could step up (Cough-Modus-Cough).
---
Ah okay. That works, then. I just imagined all the excess things just evaporating.
---
As a Fallout 1st member, I 100% do not like this suggestion. That would just be too much. They ought to just make the scrap box and survival tent free in the atom shop, in my opinion. Take those two and make them free, leave everything else. But *do not let us have the ability to respec oh my God*
---
I certainly have may own opinion on those things, which i didn't want to take in the header. So i love Fallout and i am disgusted by bethesdas behavior since serveral months. My guess is:
---
\-2020.02 free-to-play
---
\-2020.04 wastelanders arrives and flops
---
2020.06 Starfield will be announced to release end of 2020
---
\-developement silently ceases to an absolute minimum. The servers will be held open but at some point no new subs will be accepted. If Bethesda has a little decency left the will let the game run until the last subscriptions run out before they shut it down. My guess is, that this game will more or less live until the end of 2020 or beginning of 2021 at most.
---
&gt; I mean you vote with the money you give to Bethesda. 
---
I don't feel like you understand what 'voting with your money' means in the slightest. You're the problem with gaming in 2020, please shut up.
---
I'm personally not confident they will but in my mind it all rides on Wastelanders. If it's a success, then likely. If it's luke warm or flops, very unlikely.
---
No crash for me as well.
---
Happened to me last night. What kind of logic is that?
---
Me to :-)
---
Agreed cheaters are inflating their player base so unlikely they would do anything soon about them and same situation with Pokemon Go, nothing but cheaters and they haven't had a major ban wave since early 2018 during release of Mew. Most speculate why they don't do any more ban waves was the massive drop in the app store after banning spoofers.
---
Whitespring jumpsuit value just took a shit bc they’re now a reward for the Mischief event. But I’ve seen the red asylum outfit going for around 15k.
---
Well, I've checked my router and service provider out. Cleared plenty of space on my ps4, and got a fresh install. What else can I check on?
---
That is odd, but I really wouldn't take it as evidence of another player touching it.
---
I fucked up severely on the first mission that led to a catastrophic event....my son playing the same mission in the other room made the "right" decision that worked out for everyone, now I get a load screen reminding me of my fuck up...its fucking awesome!!!!
---
&gt;survivalists
---
Do you mean the now-removed game mode?
---
Whitespring jumpsuit can drop from the Halloween event, I got three yesterday alone.
---
The red asylum uniform? Assuming you got it as a drop or found it in Fort Defiance, I'd be getting a lottery ticket 😂
---
Get used to it. If you think Fallout class warfare is hard, wait until it starts happening in RL. 
---
This is just the masses getting in the mood.
---
Only 15k?? Bruh it's worth way more than that
---
No
---
Stable. I haven't had this problem before with 76, been playing off and on since launch and nothing from my service to my router has changed.
---
Here is how you fix it:   Cancel sub, uninstall game and report charges from Bethesda as fraud... because that's clearly what it is.
---
No one cares
---
It's click bait bullshit as usual.
---
If your declaring class war on someone who can afford $10 more than you a month, you have far more immediate concerns than being a video game justice warrior.
---
One rack, four pumpkins, the grim reaper cutout, skeleton mask, witch hat, and all of the 40mm in appalachia.
---
MooMoo
---
I understand your point, but surely the effect of anyone else who reads and votes the comments would skew the figures in one direction or another?
---
As far as the chance goes, I totally agree with you.
---
I'm just wondering if u/valseek's "report" to the dev team had effected some increase in drop chance.
---
My understanding is the Gatling legacy version never existed, while the pistol/rifle does.
---
A relaxig rocking animation would be so awesome!
---
I’ll give you a furious explosive gat plasma if you’re on xbox.
---
For the red asylum only trade.... no caps👍
---
Yes I found it Fort defiance.
---
Whitespring jumpsuit was very rare don't know the % halloween event.
---
Lol thats fair enough!  Ah ty so much but Im a psr person.  Appreciate it regardless.
---
This has been my experience as well
---
Cheers mate appreciate it!
---
I like these rewards much more than meat week. I can’t really use the Tenderizer or the cleavers and the flag... ho hum. But a Whitespring Jumpsuit? New pirate, fireman and orange suits? I can even see using the various pumpkin decorations again this time next year (though it’s always appropriate with the game’s “permanently frozen” Halloween setting).
---
I’ve lagged out twice in 15 events, fortunately I was able to get back in before the event ended.
---
I know I wouldn't buy a game with a subscription service, BUT if they had said the first year would be free and then it'd be 8.99 a month I probably would have paid it happily.
---
Whitespring jumpsuit isn't rare anymore, like I said I got it three times yesterday from the event. The value of it might go back up after the event ends, but I'm not sure what that will look like.
---
As for the red asylum, those go for *way* more than 15k. Like, more than 30k.
---
Asylum 25k+ super rare
---
Ehitespring jumpsuit 500 caps if lucky
---
I got the fireman outfit and hat, grim reaper cutout, and a few other odds and ends in the 6 times I’ve run it so far.
---
It's only a relative term in this case if you're backwards.
---
Ah gotcha, no problem! Good luck 😁
---
Hey atom here  
---
Yes it's a new account no its not fake. If you would like some prove as that's the day in age we live in come pop to my mixer.com/At0m_Bomb_Baby and look at my previous streams you'll see myself and son and the low level in questions.
---
Thanks friend!
---
Funny, but claiming I'm not very bright when your comeback is literally what I claimed you'd have to do is not very bright.
---
Plus yes I am new to reddit, what of it?
---
Also it appears people have checked and the op is lying.
---
Fair enough, I've not been on here long I didn't know that
---
But if you are able to enjoy the view, are you not also able to enoy the aesthetics of a good looking camp? If so, I would say the other camp items are not pointless
---
Happy Halloween! May the RNG Gods smile upon you 👏🏻
---
Crashing to the Desktop "Buzz Crashing" is an Xbox issue, not the game.
---
I have experienced some Terrible Lag on Public Servers, and even a bit on Private worlds, but have not crashed, and only DC'd once while FT to the event, out of 10  events so far.
---
Some friends who are crashing frequently seem to be the ones running older machines, I'm running on a newer One X with nothing but FO76 installed, and I can count the times I've "Buzz Crashed" on one hand, but I also have an old Xbox One Elite that crashes frequently regardless of what I'm doing.
---
The event runs much smoother on Private worlds, but I recommend a group of at least 5, it seems to spawn a lot more robots on Private worlds.
---
I had this problem in 4 and honestly the only thing that saved me was mods. The "place anywhere" mod has been a godsend. I think I'd have probably rage quit by now in 76
---
Nope PC.
---
Neither have I.
---
Granted, I'm not doing these with the frequency that I have events in the past.  But I haven't had any problems other than *really* slow loading if I zone in when the event is in progress.
---
I even managed to complete one, and log in to another server to complete a second.  With the lag though, I don't expect that to be a common occurrence.
---
Wouldn't you still need to check that in each tread they replied in is one created by a fallout 1st subscriber
---
Really three times! So no more rare 😢
---
I purchased Outer Worlds and didn't purchase FO76.
---
Oh, weird. I didn't know that it changed at all. I thought it was a bug at first
---
The problem is you shouldn't have to pay extra just to enjoy the game. It's a lame concept.
---
Not very, not right now anyways. It might go back up after the event ends! I sold the three of them yesterday for a total of 8.5k, if that gives you an idea
---
I've been waiting a long time to get this game because it's never really been what was promised or what I was looking forward to in a Fallout game.  The thing that would have caused me to buy it is *private servers* and I've been keeping up with the news about the game waiting for when that would be implemented.
---
Then they lock it behind a paywall.  The literal thing that would convince me to finally buy the game.  I'm beyond disappointed (and still not buying it).
---
I'm sorry everyone who loves this game... they aren't treating their players right at all. :(
---
I’m aware of what the definition of “solely” is. My post was referencing what I see as the “problem” or reason for all the backlash this game was getting. Every Bethesda game has been buggy as hell at release, New Vegas was almost unplayable on consoles and would crash/freeze just as often, but said games did not receive this kind of hate. Therefore what I see as the “problem” lies solely with the PR and Marketing of the game. At no point in my post did I ever say that there were not bugs and technical issues with the game.
---
I don't know but for what it's worth, Bethesda hasn't dealt with Nuclear Winter hackers that have multiple people report them with video evidence.
---
No lag on my end, and I was doing it with my level 25 noob.  The only issue is if you die after the final boss and drop your bag.  It can be tricky for a low level to recover their loot with robot respawns.  So, that the only caveat for low levels, try to escape the area as quickly as possible after event completion.
---
Upvoting s intent was to upvote articles post on topic in subs and downvote could be used if a post was off topic. 
---
Say a post about Outer Worlds on a Fallout 76 sub... or someone talking about how cool a certain food is... 
---
Here is a link but there are numerous posts and websites about Reddit voting. 
---

Aren’t most hacks PC based?

Fake news

 People who pay the $100 membership should be targeted. They are partly responsible for this mess by making it financially possible and therefore a viable business practice.

More fake news

If you pay them more money, you can have a server that works.
---
1970s telnet technology is super-hard, man. You have to give the development team time to master the complex code required to put 27 letters and 4 forms of punctuation on the screen!
---
Yeah I can agree. I’m level 55 so I guess I don’t understand the power of instant respecing. Yeah because if you could respec on the fly you basically have every single build in the game behind a pay wall.
---
It has been that way from the beginning, simply use your sort feature.
---
Cool, thanks for the suggestion. I am going to be buying one soon. Checked around and it looks like they make a noticeable difference.
---
Same
---
One person kept doing the angry emote when I did the robot, thats it.
---
Nope, as of the current version, they have not changed it.
---
Wait, so support for a new feature is priority? What a weird concept.
---
I have nothing to add here, but wanted to thank you for having an intelligent dialogue about the issue instead of hurling insults.  It's downright refreshing.  Carry on, wastelander.
---
Its an astroturfing campaign, nothing more.
---
Three.
---
Three nukes.
---
Ah. Ah. Ah.
---
I didnt ever learn any plans i guess its just bugged.
---
on PC, adding and inviting friends has been (was?) completely broken for months...
---
also, the Atom shop skins are generally of very low resolution, in fact all game textures are on the low and missing-pixels side of the scale. PC needs HD textures badly. lol, who's going to buy a pixelated skin?
---
Honestly you deserve it lmao
---
When its bugged, it has to be good (i mean valuable) ;)
---
More like bethesdas incompetence with ps stuff. Every game they have released on ps is filled with bugs.
---
You've made over 20 threads bitching about Fallout 1st, seriously.
---
It means it's directly against the sub rules on leaks and rumors. That's literally how down voting is actually supposed to be used.
---
Holy shit, that is ridiculous! I'm uninstalling immediately!
---
So far, have gotten the pirate costume,  Fireman suit, and fireman helmet.
---
Guys. Customer support can be purchased from the atomic shop for 2800 atoms. It's on the last page
---
"one shot, one kill" - random dude I randomly teamed up with in the earlier days of 76... 
---
I already have nostalgia of early 76, ffs Bethesda y u do this
---
"press X to skip"
---
Of course.  How about three nukes and 1000 mini nukes
---
Yah, happens in multiple events, queen and encryptid are 2 that come to mind
---
Mine only crashes after the event, and I keep my stuff. Honestly I'm happy with that.
---
I only ever buy stuff that's on sale, so your post is almost entirely on point for me.
---
&gt;  At no point in my post did I ever say that there were not bugs and technical issues with the game.
---
Correct. But you did say that these bugs are a non issue with your title. Which is what everyone in this thread is trying to tell you.
---
Yea, it really makes the game a chore to play most days.
---
PS4 here. I've done the event over a dozen times and never crashed.
---
 It is a really fun event and I enjoy it.  Sorry you are having terrible luck with it.
---
Hope you're not on xbox 😰
---
Destiny 2 is a great way to block FO76 from your mind. 
---
What the fam and I do is, log into fallout76 every hour to try(pray first) to do the event without crashing, If it crash or we succeed, we close game and back to destiny2.
---
Many users here have said that 1st is P2W and flat out against it so lowering the price should have 0 effect on their statement. 
---
If the argument is cost then the person doesn’t care about anyone calling it P2W since if it was lower they’d buy it. 
---
Compare and contrast Fallout 1st to ESO plus what you get and so on. 
---
Look at costs for other subscriptions for other games. 
---
Cost wise it looks to be on point compared to others. 
---
Much like other premium subscriptions, I don’t think it’s for everyone. I bought a year since I had a MS credit so it was like $45... so why not. 
---
I haven’t placed my scrap box sine most my junk is bulk and my stash is less than 700. I haven’t placed the rent yet either. 
---
I have been using the private server testing it out with friends and my son and that’s been pretty awesome! 
---
I had 7 people with me and no one hopped worlds, no one duped or glitched anything and it was a solid experience. 
---
I think world hopping on a constant level degrades that world overall so far. The number of players in any world I think are about another factor. 
---
Keep in mind cost also is a factor server wise, it does produce a cost to have numerous virtual private worlds
---
As far as I know, this is a known bug that could happen in any event if you time your death at the same time the event completes.  It's just that you are more likely to see it at events like Encryptid, Scorched Earth, Mischief Night, and AWOL Armaments, because dying in those is not unusual.
---
Known, but not high enough for them to have fixed it in Patch 14. :\\
---
It will, but will anyone be there to care?
---
This is a known bug.  If you die while an event ends you get stuck.  Happened to me atbthe queen once and again last night during One Violent Night.  I think I missed out on 3-4 legendaries that dropped.  Im guessing because of the different state you're in during a serverwide event; No loot drop, automatic respawn into the event etc, the game bricks if youre only meant to respawn into an event that is no longer active.
---
Haven't seen this on xbox... it's fake news
---
Fun fact, if you hop to people on your friendslist in private servers you can enjoy a smooth-running one and then hop to another. I have been doing 3-4 an hour just hopping to those with private on my friendslist.
---
Same here. Ran it multiple times, the only time I experienced lag was when my game defaulted to high quality settings (but that's my fault because I did some tinkering in the Ini files). Then again I've never experienced much of the long standing bugs people seem to report all the time. I'm not trying to say there aren't issues with the game but the degree to which everything varies from user to user is a little strange.
---
The only situation I encountered this problem was during Encryptid when I was shooting Imposter with exploding laser and... ash-piled myself. I couldn't do anything, just Alt-Tab and force-close the app...
---
Same, around 15 events completed, zero crashes. Xbox One X.
---
Yup! I carry a shotgun on my melee build just for scorched beasts,  make em land and then finish them.
---
Interesting logic you have there. Stephen Hawking was an expert on space, but I don't believe he actually went there himself. Some astronauts did. See what I mean? If not, I'll let you think about it.
---
2 cents per character  
---
10 cents per 6 characters if you bought Fallout 1st
---
I'm on Xbox so I can't help, what you can always leave the vault and randomly invite people to your team from the map, you'd be surprised how many people are willing to help.note: some people like myself took a while to figure out how to respond to the invite
---
Loads here. Thanks 👍
---
&lt;3!!
---
Get outer worlds. Problem solved.
---
That's where I am as well. But I don't bother to rebuild my camp.
---
Yeah, Charred Ferals are no joke with rads.
---
I realized doing Mischief Night that I had this horrible combination of Rad Worms and Charred Ferals.  Getting hit for like +114 rads/sec.  It's a wonder I was able to pop a RadAway in time.
---
If Zenimax was in charge, the game would be stable, and they would be pumping out content. Zenimax runs ESO, and they know what pays, and what doesn't.
---
Gotten the pirate costume and both parts of the fireman outfit.  
---
vampire cutout 2x
---
Multiple pumpkin plans (all different)
---
Multiple vases, walking cane 2x.
---
2 of the resort plans, but not the clock.
---
1* legendaries from the boss.
---
Except they aren't private, or servers.
---
Aaaand I'm afraid of clowns again. Thanks. I guess...
---
I believe there is something harder about the game, but it's difficult for me to put my finger on what.  I'm pretty sure that the Assault Rifle-toting Super Mutants now have projectiles similar to the Colonel Gutsy, because they blaze through armor like it's not even there.
---
Also, Legendary Scorchbeasts are just a pain because they are such ammo sponges.
---
When the legendary vendor was new and every character got max lvl weapons regardless their own lvl, i saw a guy transferring items to scrap to a mule on the roof of whitespring station. The moment he tabbed to the other fo76 instance i stopped crouching, ran towards him and got myself around 10 3* crap weapons/gear. Never laughed so hard and never felt so guilty 😅 But i hope he learned the lesson.
---
Fallout1 is in a way not a bad price compared to older battlefield games. 25$ to rent a server monthly, paid dlc or a 60$ premium. Plus it was a 60$ game
---
I saw 1 camp with a fu*k 1st written on the door. And about 50 scrap boxes in the same time frame. So 1/50.
---
Have you ever breathed through your nose before?
---
So this happened to me last night, but I laid there watching the event until completion and then closed the game and logged back in. And lo and behold, I had some new items, like pumpkin grenade, witch costume, etc. I know those must have come with that event because after each Mischief Night, I unload those things into my stash. So...I didn't get the legendary item from the sentry bot of course but still seemed to get the completion reward.  
---
But it's still a completely annoying bug!!! 🤬
---
Yup
---
Ticket it.
---
Unfortunately, there are ways involving Nuke Mines.
---
Complain to support and they will refund you. They are pretty good and it's a fairly easy process.
---
The sex addict CEO that lied on video about the game's license and issue. Don't forget that part.
---
I wonder if there is a damage threshold?
---
Haha, I can see how much it pains you having to admit that I am right.
---
You shouldn't have bought it a second time and reached the official support first :/ I hope for you they have acces to a kind of log for your atoms and refound you the amount, but still thry're the only one that can help you.
---
It has something to do with the explosions... it's happened 3 times right as I'm near a car that blows up. And I'm on a recently purchased xbox one s. So It shouldn't* be a hardware issue..?
---
Finding the red uni at Fort defiance.... It's a rare drop from a legendary, or is it just randomly located in the building?
---
It's important to know that Reddit is not the bulk of the community. A good 6th - 4th of the people I saw online last night had ranger armor, emotes, or the icon.
---
Ok juicehead explained it far better than I could so imma just put a link to what he said (hope this doesnt violate guidelines or whatever)
---
Yep. And the Fortnite skins are actually cool and feature unique animations. Here we just get a skin for one item and it costs the same, while not really being anything other than a color or pallet swap.
---
Hmm, I’ve waited for almost 10 mins and didn’t think I got anything. I will try and make sure i unload every costume and plan to my stash to make sure. Thanks for the tip.
---
So when do Support Kits start going on sale in the Atom shop?
---
Check your perk cards. 
---
I use the blocker perk card. If you do as well, unequip that card and then put it back on. 
---
Sometimes I'll notice I start taking large amounts of  melee damage and I swap that card off and then back on and it seems to go back to "normal".
---
It seems like perk cards have a way of turning themselves off in a way and you have to unequip them and then re-equip them to get them to take affect again.
---
I'm not going to wear a pumpkin suit after this week really.. I like the meat week flag a lot though
---
Pretty much.
---
I'm sure there were isolated instances of it happening originally, but now, they are just playing a role.  It's basically turned into the latest excuse to grief someone for any reason from our so-called "Raiders."
---
Because, let's face it, the whole Raider thing didn't really work out.  No one accepted that because most Raiders in Fallout games end up with a hole in their head.  These people just wanted to troll and steamroll others.  Now, they have a new excuse, and they probably assume they have some kind of self-righteous high ground.  Very toxic combination.
---
Same here.  I was playing on XBone last night, ran the event 4 times, once with a good dozen people showing up.  I mean it was chaotic as fuck, with explosions every which way thanks to some people using a fat man and missile launchers, but there were no crashes, no delay in defacing the buildings or anything.  At worst, there was a second of reduced frame rate when the big booms went off, but that's it.
---
I crash or freeze almost everytime too. Unplayable in the evening. (xbox)
---
By making a statement of what you perceive as a PR disaster would be the same as admitting they did something wrong.
---
 Which they did not. 
---
I and many, many, many more people purchased the 1st subscription which means it was a success to Bethesda.
---
 I am completely happy with my subscription and I will probly keep paying for it month after month.
---
 You're acting as if Bethesda should pay more attention to the people who don't pay money as opposed to the people who do pay money. That just doesn't make any sense in any logical explanation.
---
You lose caps equal to your lvl. if yiu die in pvp, no?  Cant hide those in your 1st bucket.  Paying the 8/12 mo also wont make you any better at pvp.  This is a weak argument.
---
Agreed there, the pumpkin suits are my least favorite rewards. Consider also when comparing the to meat week that there’s also a guaranteed legendary via the Sentry Bot at the end of mischief.
---
Yeah, I might try that. Though I haven't even opened the game yet. I kinda hate playing games by myself, and my friends refuse to play it. Me, I just like to give games a chance. Is it similar to any other survival games?
---
Happens also if you die shortly after killing him.  Happened to me and a few friends on private just after we managed to loot him but got overwhelmed by robots.
---
You forgot a piece of corn.
---
You could say the same for having to purchase new players over and over for every single FIFA game as well
---
And this guy is waiting to see if Bethesda pushes that “update” back another year with the NPC’s.
---
I don't get how so many people crash on the event. I'm on ps4 and I never experienced something more that fps drop in the event (easy to spot when your lax fps is 30 :trollface: ).
---
I got the Whitesprings Jumpsuit a couple times on the first day, but nothing that rare since.
---
I got the Fireman Uniform a couple times (note: this is the beige one - it's not the Fire Breathers or Responders one, it's unique to this event), Fireman Helmet, Jack O' Pant Suit, Pirate Costume (but not the hat, so far), and a few worthless generic costumes like the Witch Hat.
---
Pc or ps4?
---
Equip a the tin foil hat or even a skull mask, when you're in PA it removes your clothing.
---
Haha,. That's where we draw the line.
---
Need to take off helmet and wear mask/ costume hat
---
Seems you have to take off the helmet at wear a mask or hat if you’re using power armor. The game will remind you if you don’t have a costume during the event.
---
Right about what? You can quit the game world and server hop if someone attacks you. Everyone with a brain will deposit junk before willingly engaged in Pvp. They have been doing this since the game was released.
---
Yeah thats propably what will happen.
---
ESO plus is another Bethesda subscription and its $14.99 a month, which you get unlimited crafting space, crowns (instead of atoms) and access to all DLC’s which cost everyone money if you don’t have subscription.
---
I got a year 50% off of ESO as a gift and comparing the 2 it’s about the same type deal and many users have it. 
---
1st is cheaper more so if you buy the year which I did with a credit I had. Value for what you get it seems high HOWEVER... due to certain issues going on overall... yeah it’s worth it fully.
---
Who would pay for it and then cancel? It's already paid for, might as well use it
---
1. So the xp you got to do the first one doesn't count for the 2nd and 3rd now?
---
2. This doesnt exactly answer my question, but thank you very much for replying anyways. It looks like due to your situation you dont have the information to answer it. I'll get the 1st reward really quick tomorrow and see what happens.
---
I see that. In my case I already loved and enjoyed it. It’s the only game I play and I play every week. I was genuinely surprised at how much more I enjoyed it using the tent.
---
Fallout 76 is getting worse, No mans sky is now an Awesome multiplayer game!
---
It’s just as easy on a private server, just takes longer for one or two people.
---
Return to cosmetic only isn't going to happen, and it was unrealistic for them to promise that, or for players to expect it.
---
Fixing and expanding the social menu features is one of the best things they can do.
---
Are we really still bitching because this isn't a single player game? Get a grip, jesus christ...
---
I’ll keep saying this, go to Borderlands 3. They dropped a Halloween event that lasts till Dec 5 for free and so far I’ve had no issues whilst playing it, even when playing with friends. 
---
You’ll thank me later. 
---
EXPLOSIONS!!!!
---
Go rifleman if you want a challenge.
---
Stop saying stuff is easy otherwise they're gonna make another insanely difficult event!!!!!!
---
You can do a speed run then jump to a private server and try to complete with your friend in the remaining time.
---
Coffee cup?
---
This approach worked for him because he was using this time to not justify his issues or justify them but to resolve them. He went back and told them he would make it right and did. He didn't steal ideas and then sell them back to the same community that was trying to support them.
---
Short answer: No (at least it shouldn't).
---
Lmao
---
Actually by definition they can't. They aren't being publicly traded, so there aren't any shares to hold.
---
I don’t see them as the issue with the backlash, if anything they are the straw breaking the camel’s back, not the anvil. I totally understand what you’re saying and don’t disagree with the interpretation but it just seems very knit picky and salty to crap on a post over title wording and interpretation rather than the content of what someone is saying. If someone thinks that the bugs are the bigger problem and are more responsible for the backlash I can certainly respect that as everyone’s views are different and things bother people in different ways. If I went through this sub though and just attacked based upon the titles of posts (especially when there is no way to edit titles) and didn’t read anything (as several people have done) it just seems like misdirected anger. If I had worded the title as “I think the main problem with the backlash against this game is Bethesda’s PR and Marketing strategy” maybe it would have been better but in the heat of the moment, being upset with the company’s practices I didn’t do that. I can’t change it, so now I’m getting all the toxicity from people who are just as upset as I am thinking I’m defending the game, when I’m not without reading the post.
---
Lol, buggy events doesn't make them more money. If you haven't noticed already. Anything that that can make them more $$$ takes priority over any bug. Not even if the bug has been around since day one.
---
You do realise that this isn't directly related to Fallout 1st only? It's a general issue of communication.
---
Look at the mood of the subreddit. Do they seem happy to you?
---
Good for you if you're happy spending money on Fallout 1st. It's immaterial of what was being requested in the post.
---
Which is completely irrelevant and not what I asked about. Do you know what a "straw man" is? If not look it up.
---
I'll be there. Maybe alone, but I'll be there
---
i have been in three mischief nights that were kicked off before rewards.  everyone standing around wondering what happened .
---
Because buying a single month signs you up for a recurring monthly membership.
---
its actually a brand new pirate hat, it looks better too, kinda bigger
---
&gt;I don’t see them as the issue with the backlash
---
Then you are blind.
---
The ‘rug glitch’ is very handy for getting items to fit snuggly together. I also highly recommend blueprints for items that otherwise jump to roofs or refuse placement due to intersecting assets. Just build the item, blueprint it, store it, and use the blueprint to place the item where you want it to go.
---
With them, I’ve been able to fill pre-existing structures with camp objects that otherwise refuse placement due to intersections.
---
Ouch, did it work out&gt;?  
---
Wonder if it's related to the respawn loop?
---
Go into shop and make sure it’s enabled. Try restarting game.
---
Name checks out. You should be concerned.
---
I wanna know where all these people complaining are getting private server rentals for free, hell I'd love it for 7 Days To Die, hook me up  XD I don't even play but this is a silly thing to complain about.
---
I love the outer worlds! It’s pretty impressive!
---
Photos please!  
---
There is a half empty one on the tables, but the fully empty one is not linked to the leveled list
---
Honestly, some kind of feature settings to capitlize on players taking the role of raiders and make it an ingame thing, then just rp would be great. I'm reminded of that guy who played the role of a Raider Lord and stuck a cap bounty on himself to people could raid his compound for it
---
Endless AP drain and the engaging with a jump?
---
Btw, can any1 confirm if fasnacht mask + bloody chef outfit counts as full costume?
---
Your example is pretty wrong, before anything, Hawking is an expert in physics, and you, I am sorry, are nothing.
---
Now that you mention it....
---
Look your clearly upset and you are clearly avoiding responding to my statement. Have a good day.
---
Yes but its been iut for like a week or two? Use it until it's the day before you resubcribe
---
Yep, all free!
---
I don’t disagree with any of that. My point is that Bethesda titles are always a buggy mess at release with a lot of problems. New Vegas was almost unplayable on consoles at release, which is just as unacceptable. However there has never been this much hate and backlash before and the company was still largely loved despite those things. Therefore the problem with the hate and backlash are the shady marketing and PR practices with this game. The bugs are the straw that broke the camel’s back not the anvil in my opinion.
---
In that case idk man. I’ve had problems with my ps4s connection before but that was just because the console couldn’t get a strong connection to the router.
---
I think the nice:asshole ratio has severely skewed in the last few weeks, between nice flight to Outer Worlds and formerly nice going rogue and becoming assholes. Plus the actual assholes must feel very empowered right now, what with all the anger over Bethesda's latest money grab.
---
I think it usually comes out in about 2-3 hours from now
---
you probably don't care, but as long as the game doesn't need to update you can just run it through the exe without having the launcher running
---
No crashes for me and I’ve done at least a dozen or so run throughs.
---
I’ve got a better idea... Joe could nuke it 6 times
---
Go back out andere rejoin
---
The server
---
Were you at Monster Mash? Because if it was that one, it wasn't griefing related to Fallout 1st
---
Bethesda announced two single player games the same day they announced 76. Starfield and ES6.
---
Been playing since launch, I'm not suffering at all. I throughly enjoy my private server.
---
Im on ps4
---
Yea would not likely spend money on outfits just because the prices are crazy bad, 8 dollars for basic colors on Power Armor that should be in the game and around 20 dollars for paint jobs for armor just don't make sense to buy instead just to grind atoms and only buy the must have items.
---
1 for me.  I never raid.  I was very excited when raids came into the game.  But the game was too unstable and it just ruined the experience for me.
---
&gt;rebalancing
---
how would it be rebalanced? its all balanced around 4 person teams. DITW is easy with a 4 person team, meltdown is ok with 4 people, only trouble one really is washout.
---
&gt;due to how unplayable the raid is
---
unplayable how? we have a few door bugs happen pre raid start but otherwise its been fine as long as you jump into a relatively ok server (squading up before joining a server gives the best odds)
---
&gt;lack of people to help me
---
yeah this part here i could agree with, some form of lfg or more natural way to find groups to run with would be useful.  (xbox has a lfg fortunately, i feel bad for the other systems)
---
That’s it?
---
Pople forget that Doom and Doom Eternal, Starfield, TES6, Wolfenstein, The Evil Within, Ghostpunk Tokyo are ALL SINGLEPLAYER GAMES.
---
I'm on a Xbox One X as well as two friends of mine and we've done the event about 10 times over the last two days together. The only crash we've had was Minecraft last night about two minutes afterwards while I tried to walk over to White Springs station to get away from the robots with my overencumbered ass.
---
I should mention they are both on Xbox One X's as well.
---
Ok.
---
Worked for me
---
Eventually the 20 or so of you that are mad over nothing will move on (I hope), and stop shot posting. They never said everything would be free. They said all the DLCs would be. They have been, and will be. They never said there wouldn't be a subscription for QoL features.
---
Get over yourself. You are entitled to nothing.
---
This is insane. You shouldn’t have to defend yourself like this.
---
You on xbox? Me and my friends typically run them everyday on all three difficulties. We do it on private servers, so theres no lag.
---
 Sentinel appears to be all or nothing vs x5 15% rolls but many people have been reporting an increase in damage taken
---
Nope I was at the Mischief Night event, as I said people was doing the cash emote and the thumbs down so it was definitely related to me having Fallout 1st, I didnt mind personally I knew it was just for a laugh so I went along with it.
---
I can see you didn't understand the point of what I was saying.
---
Anyway, I'm clearly wasting my time here so good bye. Have a nice day.
---
Myself and two others I regularly play with in this about 10 times together over the past two days. No crashes between the three of us on Xbox One X's.
---
Mine crashed once last night about 3 minutes after the event was over as I was limping over to White Springs station.
---
I’ve only ever seen one and that was in a vendor going for 15k
---
Seeing how Wastelanders has been delayed several times, I doubt it'll flop, they wouldn't delay something unless they TRULY fucking want it to be good.
---
When you buy a month of something, you expect to get full use of it for a month, regardless of whether you want another month of it. It's not like they don't charge you the full amount upfront.
---
it doesn't have to be, but it's an option
---
I mean its just a personal fear but each to their own i guess
---
People have been butthurt about this not being singleplayer since it's initial announcement. Get over it and move it people...
---
Say that to yourself, loser. Crawl back to whatever you came from.
---
3, because they can be fun at points.  But the quest design is way too much busy work and gradually reduces the fun factor over time.  It literally made one of my friends rage quit the game because of the lag and tedious nature.
---
Thank you.
---
though afaik that's a standard cut for just about anything digital
---
Same to you buddy.
---
Also you might wanna read rule #4 of this forum.
---
I didn't know that at all, ive never once sorted it. Must have just activated somehow
---
They have been fixing the game. Going so far to delay wastelanders to 2020, causing a unneeded CONTENT DROUGHT to fix the game.
---
I played raids few times, but only to do challenges related to it. Usually few runs are enough to complete the challenge. I think it's 5/10 for me  - I really enjoy the interiors, but don't like quests and lack of lore. Lags and disconnects only lowers the final rating.
---
I had that experience as well.
---
atoms must be leaking through packet loss
---
Why are you posting cringe dude?
---
I thought you said you are done, you are even a worse liar than Bethesda lol
---
DeathofDNA i might not be on tonight, but ill be on friday for sure
---
I've been wanting to try some Enclave RP, and I'm working on a power armor trooper-esque build. I'm fairly new (only level 18 as of this posting) but if be willing to try something if you are.
---
To be fair dialogue is a huge part of that game. I guess I’m a huge fan of fallout 3 and fallout nv so I love the dialogue. But I will say the game really picks up once you get to terra 1 monarch
---
Normally between 11am - Noon Est.
---
Like the one where you gather 50 key cards then defend a geck that's frail as all hell.  Who thought this was good quest design?
---
Not to mention, it's really stupid and in 2019 most gamers are more educated in fighting the company not the people supporting said company.
---
I know but you are handing them money and then are like, nevermind. That's what they want. You give them money and then dont use the service. Bow they have the money and the servers are more stable for other users because there are less people on them.
---
Thanks captain karma🙂
---
It's fine. English is a bitch of a language anyway. Most of us Americans barely speak it properly.
---
Absolutely! Sounds like it could be a blast! DM me your In-Game name and I'll add you! :D
---
bethesda even foresaw that and despite TES6 and Starfield not having much development DONE, they announced both of them after 76 to assure people that "Yeah, we're sticking to RPGS after this."
---
My friend quit after the 3rd crash.
---
It doesn't show up in your subscriptions because it isn't a subscription on Ps4. Meaning no auto renewal
---
Have been playing the game since Beta and have never done the raids. The bug problems, resource expenditure, and lack of worthwhile rewards just don’t seem worth it. I’ve watched play-throughs etc and honestly they just don’t seem fun to me either. I can accomplish more for less faster grinding without being bound to the instance or letting a team down if I have to leave.
---
You do realize that just cause they are giving the game, doesn't mean they don't have faith?
---
Not one crash for me. There is lag on stage transitions but granted there is 20+ people all in the area.
---
i thought it was triggered every hour, so how is it still available on other servers after you complete one?
---
Alright Ill add you, and yeah I work a lot of hours during the day and we are undermanned today so I may or may not be on today as well. My psn is DillusionalProxy
---
Just pointing out the Cops, Cop.
---
Yep. They also never said that Private worlds would be free, everyone EXPECTED them to be, but I doubt bethesda would kill their own game by giving people FREE private servers.  
---
They said DLC (Wild Appalachia, NW, Wastelanders, future DLCs) would be free, as they are but that means there needs to be some money coming in thus the updates to the atom shop and Fallout First.
---
It was delayed only once. 
---
It was a good delay. To make sure they have it all set and ready.
---
Dailies aren't massive instanced events for specific prizes, they're just collect, kill or craft missions for atoms in case you hadn't noticed.  How would that make Mischief night stand out enough to get large  groups to play together? 
---
Personally I think events like this are just so the devs can stress test the servers disguised as holiday events to attract players. That's why they're having tons of people in one spot and tons of explosions.
---
I have a Xbox one s too and I made a post about this earlier with over a 100 comments and it seemed like ps4 and pc weren’t having any problems so maybe it is just Xbox haha
---
Why would they? That’s “sleepy time” for all of the Americas, and working hours (8am - 5pm) for pretty much everywhere else in the world that isn’t Australia.
---
Yes, people work different shifts, but the delta of “people working off hours + people who play FO76 + people who play the NW game mode” would definitely be ridiculously small.
---
7 and 8
---
Theyre awesome
---
Shared loot hasn’t been rolled out yet afaik that was a 2020 thing.
---
Sometimes this works. I've done several nukes on my private server. 
---
Sometimes leaving and coming back in did nothing. 
---
Sometimes closing the game app and relaunching it does the trick. Be warned though I have had it put me in a totally new server though and have lost my last zone doing this.
---
Thanks.
---
If the game was free I would not mind paying some money. However, after already paying full price and being asked to spend more money for stuff? Why?
---
r/itswooooshwith4os
---
So much this.
---
I honestly don't know how you could get bored with New Vegas. I this is coming from me, who's first Fallout game was 4! I played hours upon hours of it. I liked and decided to try New Vegas and Three. I've now beaten New Vegas three times and absolutely love the DLC. I went back to play 4 and it was still fun. I then went back to 3 and New Vegas and enjoyed them even more.
---
Mind sharing what you like about them? What draws you in?
---
I wouldn’t say they’ve given up - vault 79 just got added last patch secretly - still can not access it yet tho
---
Perhaps the title shouldn't contain the word "solely" then.
---
Also nice way to say fanboys abandoned bethesda when some of us still like Bethesda and are just bored of 76 and waiting for Wastelanders
---
Have you a friend to come in? Nuke it and get someone to spawn in at the train station everything should freshly respawn.
---
Damn, I paid like $10 for mine. Shoulda waited.
---
If you’re not coughing up at least $13 a month, then you’re beneath Bethesda. You’re not important enough. You don’t matter to them. This is Bethesda now...
---
I definitely read “esp your toilet paper” as if you actually used it and thought, “well, that’s rude. Shitting on their gift to you. Wait, you can shit in Fallout?” Then I remembered scrapping exists. 
---
TL;DR, I’m an idiot.
---
The issue is this sub is not Bethesda owned. It’s not even an official sub. It was created by fans. BGS CMs where only granted a special watch role. 
---
The only real official forums is their own.
---
Oh by we have a disrespected customer that keeps coming back over here!! Dude, or Dudette, stop playing. There’s only one way for them to hear you. They certainly don’t read the shit on here.
---
Reminds me of that video by a certain youtuber upset that Bethesda cited some fans as why the fridge, robot, scrap kits and repair kits were added to the atom shop, when he saw no one tolerant of it, more not really wanting it.  
---
Reddit isn't the WHOLE beth fanbase.
---
There are far less angry people than you think. They just happen to be very vocal.
---
And, to be honest, I actually prefer New Vegas' crafting and gunplay. I lot of people complain about them and say how much better these mechanics are in F4, I don't know, maybe it's because F4 was my first entry in the series.
---
I have a Xbox one s too and I made a post about this earlier with over a 100 comments and it seemed like ps4 and pc weren’t having any problems so maybe it is just Xbox haha for me i hang back and wait while everyone destroys everything and crouching and looking at the ground helps a lot too
---
I'm sorry. Was there a question somewhere in your statement? You asked me why would anyone carry that much junk? I believe I already answered that yesterday. What other questions did you ask that I "avoided"?
---
It's hard to say, I've loved the Fallout brand forever.  But the damage to the name is undeniable.  Also after playing Outer Worlds, I'm starting to question Bethesda's ability to evolve their own games and not be stuck in place creatively.
---
&gt;  the chainsaw needs some care and consideration Bethesda.
---
This so much. 
---
I'd love to see it get a buff and Beth add some legendary variants: Anti-Armor, Bloody, Junkies, etc. 
---
It has the potential to be a fun weapon, but Beth has let it become a meme item.
---
Same. Also Project Paradise.
---
Im a plan collector, so the prospect of cool new plans was what drew me in.
---
But the challenges for emotes and icons, as well as the grind to craft the good armor is a nice challenge.
---
Also, i run melee, so i never use ammo. That means that i have a huge ratio of materials expended/materials earned, making vault raids surprisingly profitable.
---
Man I wish Bethesda payed me for liking their game.
---
Didn't they say it'd come out Fall 2019 then delayed it then delay it again to 2020?
---
We're actively investigating reports of the Halloween event crashing.
---
PR people aren't sayign the game is good. You're just saying that defenders of this game are hired by bethesda.
---
Folks want something to rage about on the game.  Unconfirmed FUD threads have been spread from 76 to kotaku several times I can recall since game released.
---
Exactly this.  Beyond - while not perfect - definitely moved No Man’s Sky to a playable, enjoyable state.  That said, I really wish HG would fix base building.
---
No. All I've got is plans I already know, like Vault-tec jumpsuit. Nothing. Nada.
---
If you manage to finish one real quick, you can try your luck on another server and hope it hadn't concluded on that one yet.  The last one I tried last night dragged on because there were only 3 participants, and one was a level 22 that kept getting killed.
---
My point is that it’s not a bug free game but yes of course the game has improved and yeah I wonder if maybe we get some new content to help us get through to wastelanders, even if fashgduvvduaut came back for a week I would be content (because I missed the event)
---
No. Just OP so far. Hopefully he doesn't start a panic. Some people will believe anything.
---
It'll probably change for Wastelanders.
---
When did I say I was done? Also, can you tell me what this current discussion is about?
---
I'm not apart of the PR team. I think the game is great and this community is toxic and blows everything out of proportion.
---

I’ve never done the raid after all of the controversy surrounding lose of characters and gear out of fear that it’ll happen to me.
---
It’s a great sign when you put out a piece of content and people don’t want to play it out of fear their characters will get wiped for no reason.
---
This is Fall 2019 time table. November was still in the Fall market. 
---
At least that was the info I had. Their wasn’t an official release month until QuakeCon. If I remember the first announcement just said Fall 19.
---
3 and 2. The second one has totally killed my will to do them one more time. Worst raid ive done
---
WHAT ?! You are saying Bethesda is not doing the best for the players ?? Wow...shocked here.
---
In the words of Mindless Self Indulgence:  "You want your money back? yo - listen up. No fucking refunds!".  You either buy in or bust out in the wasteland.
---
Unlike to common belief, Vanguard is the games worst type of armor, together with Bolstering.
---
Why is that so? For PvP, it's a waste of prefix that could be spent for something truly useful, like assassin, unyielding or chameleon. If you're not full of stealthboys you're gonna get VATSed and DR is useless for VATS Crit protection, and if you are full of stealthboys assassin is still better.
---
For PvE, if you'd compare the difference in damage that results from 175 DR (full Vang set bonus), then you'd notice 175DR translates to less than 10% damage reduction. What does it mean? It means that single ghoul Slayer piece is more efficient at protecting you from ghouls than full set of vanguard armor is. If you want to go PvE, then mix of ghoul Slayer, mutant Slayer, zealots and exterminators will provide you higher overall PvE protection that vanguard.
---
There is also no such thing as all-around best armor type. Depends on the playstyle and the distances you prefer to fight on. While there's no single best armor type nor single best playstyle, there is one that is the most universal one, and it is the bloodied commando sneaker. 1x chameleon, 2x assassin, 2x unyielding.
---
Not to mention, it's very argueable how the survival camp is p2w whereas a Junkbox is p2w, and I agree on that.
---
Wtf? Did I time travel back to september 2018?!? o\_O
---
Well you can relax it won't happen. 76 will shut down before then.
---
I've only seen 1 star bots... but then again I've only actually made it to the and of the event a handful of times... is it always a 1 star? Or is os more sometimes?
---
ESO was made by Zenimax Online Studios, but yeah most subs are standardized now.
---
Bad publicity can be just as good if not better than bad publicity.
---
That's what PR teams do. Comment using guidelines as if they were another player to influence the general opinion.
---
It would just be nice if Beth, Zenimax or whoever put thought and care into how they treated their community so people wouldn't have a reason to think things like this.
---
You're open to not paying and just playing like I did.
---
:P
---
No. They said that DLC would be free. Wild Appalachia, Nuclear Winter, Wastelanders. It has been and will be. They did say the Atome Shop would be cosmetic only, but Atoms just weren't selling. Now we have a subscription. They never said they wouldn't do that.
---
I have the XB1-X, and all my runs were smooth, with no crashes, but the one time we had about a dozen or so players, with one group using fat man and missile launchers, then that time the explosions became a little too much, but it was only a one second max lag.
---
You keep giving them ideas, all they want is your money.
---
Exactly
---
You sound like a conspiracy theorist.
---
OP if you don't actually play the game then you're probably another astroturfer
---
Ah.
---
I hope it can be made to run smoothly! It's definitely one of my favorite events so far!
---
Ditto, they focused strongly on dialog and made the action side pretty lackluster.  
---
Not saying it's a bad game, I do kinda regret not just renting it though.
---
Vault armour cannot roll unyielding.
---
For me personally, now that I have completed the PA, that makes the raid pretty pointless.
---
It's unfounded. There's no reason to think that suddenly the DLCs will cost money.
---
I'm sure Bethesda right now is focused on fixing the game, then adding the content, then fixing the game, then adding more content.
---
Right but the model side by side if you compare and contrast have numerous similarities. 
---
I mentioned this here in this sub 200+ days ago... wasn’t exactly well received...lol

But that’s kinda far and this music is gonna drive me insane
---
Honestly Bethesda’s Rap for taking out hackers is terrible and the basically don’t have a cheating detection system in place.. as long as your aren’t using it to dupe Weapons or break into many unintended locations, I’m sure you’ll get away with doing anything in this game..
---
Amen, brother!
---
Dude it’s a multiplayer spinoff relax. It’s not fallout 5
---
You do release this isn’t an official Bethesda forum right? The CM’s are always active on the actual Bethesda forums, they just come here now and again because this is a pretty vocal portion of the player base (although half the people here are just here to complain)
---
He's saying half of the 20 angry people shitposting about the subscription don't play. He's right.
---
I left and went back in and there was hordes...
---
You sound like that kind of people who attack the messenger to devalue the argument
---
For a lowlevel guy like me it’s hell. Died a couple of times, burned through stimpacks and ammo, failed. Wish Bethesda would synchronise servers with player-levels.
---
If only that were an option for us console plebs. I've had a crash and a failure to respawn after death in only 5 attempts at the event on ps4.
---
Oh no, I agree. And I haven't seen people pissed. I think people were getting more mad cause all the clickbait like  
---

BETHESDA ADDED AN ANNUAL 100$ SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE HAHA!\*  
---
\*13$ a month my guy.
---
Your more the welcome to join us if you want, were a player or two short most of the time since some of my friends have school and other responsibilities. Our ages range from 38 to 16, me being 28. Were all pretty mature, except for the odd fart or poop joke from time to time. Lol
---
Well I’m doing something wrong. I couldn’t complete the event with 2 people on our server.  Those assaultrons kicked my butt. 8 coming out of no where and ganging up on you seems like an unfair fight.
---
Like other events I wish players would read up or try and find out how to complete the event instead of doing things that don’t help or make it fail.
---
Think im lucky. Out of about 10 I've lagged out on one, so we failed (despite about 10 people standing around waiting in the courtyard).
---
Lmao, I still don't understand how this is an insult. 😉 
---
Police Officers make more than I do. As they should given the amount of disrespect they get. I couldn't deal with thier line of work you have to deal with the worst of society.
---
Smh, Seems everyone hates the Police until they need them. You need to grow up.
---
Mistakes were made, uninstalling!
---
The toilet paper is rare. I’ve never acquire one since, so i decided to keep it.
---
The Free People just want freedom, the 1st Placers also want freedom and fancy fixins. Everyone can get along and agree that in this situation you have to make your own fun unless you want to pay for it.
---
It is better during less busy hours aye? I noticed that too.
---
You're sitting here using string theory to connect PR PEOPLE who have ACTUAL roles noting they are PR people to players.
---
Thank you. Glad to hear you enjoy them.
---
Are those always full cores?
---
Now that I think of it, sentries always seem to drop full cores but I'm not sure. There's definitely value in full cores over lots of partials for weight.
---
but thats a fair criticism, granted on solar it would be useless but thorns unyielding would be pretty great imo.  and a great example of a needed change.
---
but to call for rebalancing and tweaks with absolutely no info outside of "plz change" doesn't help or add discussion about it, its part of why i asked in my main comment.
---
No they dont.
---
In a publicly traded company, shareholders don't really have much of a say in what goes on. Private investors only have as much power as is written into their contract.
---
That said, I wouldn't be surprised to see Zenimax go public in the ntdf. Or sellout completely (here's hoping Activision doesn't buy them out)
---
Except that you are dismissing the fact that ALL of us are paying customers as we ALL gave then money for this game. If I could get my money back I would as they totally misrepresented what this was. I am shocked that someone hasn't begun a class action law suit over this yet.
---
Seriously.  
---
At least wait for the event to start before you launch.  That way, you can guarantee that it will be DURING the event.  If you wait until the middle, there is the slight chance that it will be over before the nuke hits.
---
Yes, besthesda is in its best shape, they couldn't be more involved in the best interest for the game and its players, the community is the problem, if a player find a bug and DARE TO COMMENT about it, what a filthy asshole, if a player comlains about having to pay a subscription in a paid game that had a disastrous launch in order to have some of what was promised and quality of life added, he is a hateful and waste of human being that breaths toxicity, you are correct sir, I honestly hope all game developers start acting exactly like Bethesda ! I'm so thrilled that I finally see the truth, thanks to you pal.
---
Username checks out.
---
/s
---
Probably so, but is it really worth knit-picking a title (that I can’t change) written in the heat of the moment over the content of a post? What’s the point of that?
---
We will have to wait, the roller coaster doesn’t but I personally love the game
---
Curious if this bug still exists.
---
The Free People want to be free. If you can't enjoy freedom get the fuck out of public. Pay for your privacy rich man! lol
---
They are working on fixing the game for everyone.  
---
AWS isn't something Bethesda controls.
---
There used to be a chemistry station, it's now a brewing station.
---
You cant get unyeilding raid armor? I didnt know this. Is that the only effect or are there others?
---
Yeah I am actually, I'd love to join you!
---
Tin foil hat theories intensifies.
---
Also you should try FO1st it's fantastic. Private servers, portable camps, 1650 atoms, a pretty sweet infinite junk stash and don't forget it's the only way to get the ranger outfit!
---
All for a low low introductory price!!! Hurry up and buy now supplies are limited.
---
I thought that was some preparation for wastelanders?
---
You're right that they don't necessarily owe the subreddit much directly but they owe us as customers, irrespective of where we are. 
---
The request is being made here but the issue is universal. From what I've seen, they're mostly radio silent in their official forums too, not to mention other major but equally not "official" platforms like Twitter.
---
People gonna people.
---
Maybe because sometimes events that seem buggy for you aren't buggy for others out there because maybe your server just doesn't handle everything alright.
---
I wouldn't mind joining a group for the Raids, if that's okay obviously. Rifle/Shotgun cripple build, can hold my own and learn the mechanics pretty fast!
---
Am I? I would say you're account proves my point.
---
Sweet. Whats your time zone and the hours you typically play? Most of us are EST and play around 9pm to 12pm
---
Wow Bethesda is my younger brother, apparently.
---
Never knew that. It would make sense, lore-wise, why it would be. 
---
Thanks for dropping the knowledge.
---
Lmao that one of the main points of the game is to get nuke codes and use them, it’s just a shit game with shit servers.
---
Chat box would be a good start. That's been a sore spot for a long time. Revamping how grouping up works would also help. RIght now, I have zero incentive to play with anyone else. As you said, they will only slow me down. The core mechanics of needing to tag enemies, enemies dying ludicrously fast, and how respawns in the game work, leads to me feeling like every other player around me is my enemy. They're either killing nuked mobs that I spawned in by leaving / rejoining the server (using 2 accounts and leaving one in game to rejoin it and respawn enemies), or I feel obligated to wait for them to tag (and when I do, half the time they instantly kill the mobs instead of letting me finish them off). Even with the SBQ, because her health scales up with the number of player, and other players on average contribute only about 10-15% of the damage that I am (and that number is probably generous to them), them being there means that the boss is just straight up harder.
---
Honestly, if I still played, I'd remove everyone from my friends list and play by myself with FO1st. Being able to easily have full control over my nuked zones, easy SBQ kills, less lag - that all sounds great. Infinite scrap is huge too. I'm part of that "Adventurer" group and I'm one of the die hard min/maxers.
---
But the issue is, as you've said, lack of content. Yes, I could do those things now and not have to deal with anyone else. I'd probably have paid $8 per month for that at the height of my FO76 addiction. I would have taken issue with it costing so much, but I would have paid it. But what is there to do? I've already min/maxed my way into an unstoppable level 400 killing machine. Hell, I have a level 120 verion too on my 2nd account. I have 6 mules at level 50+ purely to hold all the excess crap that I've found because "it's worth something to somebody (I'm looking at your Junkies 25% FFR Gatling Plasma)". Vault "raids" i guess? I can invite my friends to my FO1st server and we can do vault raids I suppose, except, apparenlty that doesn't help with lag at all. Oh and let's not forget that the poison damage power armor is still bugged and causes horrendous lag and FPS issues. 
---
Some ideas that would bring me back:
---
* Seasonal "ladders". Start from scratch in a much more difficult game mode, with far less food / water (enemies drop less too). This could last 2-3 months, maybe more, and have seasonal rewards (unique legendaries with unique looks / effects, emotes, camp items, outfits, PA skins, etc.). After 2-3 months your character goes back to adventure mode, and a new season starts. This will bring players back to the game every few months and they can play as much or as little as they like. Have seasonal exclusive events.
---
* Bring back survival mode in a seasonal format. This is how it should have been from the start IMO. 
---
* Have multiple Leaderboards for both season types, but these need to be platform wide. Getting on the top 10 or even top 100 would have real meaning. 
---
Things that could be interesting to track on the leaderboard:
---
* Caps Earned
---
* NPC kills
---
* SBQ kills
---
* Player kills
---
* longest survived time in game (for survival)
---
* damage done
---
* legendaries looted
---
* legendaries scrapped
---
...use your imagination! And GIVE REWARDS for all of these things to the top 10 players at the end of the season. Exclusive titles, skins, etc. Give me a reason to flex my power gaming muscles! This is really just the tip of the iceberg for fun ideas that could be added. I am neck deep in Classic WoW right now, but if you gave me the things mentioned above, I'd be back in FO76 and I'd even buy a FO1st subscription the moment those things were added. 
---
The best part of all of this? It's mostly RECYCLED content. You don't need to add much in terms of new things. That means low cost to implement.
---
I guess you didn't see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dostdt/i_was_a_pr_shill_account_poster_and_can_give_some/) yesterday.

I have a pirate outfit you can have if you're ps4
---
13$ a month is on par with most sub services. XBLG was 10 a month  
---
Pandora Premium was 5$ a month  
---
Spotify is 10 a month.  
---
ESO Plus is around 10 a month.
---
You really took that an ran with it. None of that really applies to what I said.   
---
If you don't enjoy the game don't play it. Know what I'm tired of coming to this sub-reddit and seeing? Stupid posts complaining about Bethesda. If you don't enjoy the game don't play it. Your not being pro-active by making a reddit post.
---
Well, the point is that it gives people a wrong impression about the state of the game. The game is fundamentally flawed and good PR and marketing wouldn't fix that.
---
I thought some of the issues I've called out were pretty obvious considering how little people actually care about the raid. The few times I've done it with other players, our run as been ruined by doors and slow terminals.
---
When I say rebalancing, I mean the rewards and maybe the timer. A lot of people don't think the rewards are worth it. And with how unstable the servers can be, a timer is not a good mechanic.
---
It gets laggy as hell due to all the explosions but not had it crash on me on pS4.
---
I mean, why would they? The ones they responded to paid extra for the game! Obviously they should be catered to first!
---
Not entirely sure, not willing to risk finding out though
---
Yeah, I don't like players being targeted because they spent money, but just cause you spent money doesn't mean you get higher class either.
---
I just got basically identical rewards in back to back events, just seems to be a bad dice roll.
---
Sometime if your settings are too low, your cpu will start driving the game rather then you gpu.  This cause the performance the suffer.  The better your gpu, the more likely the CPU will take over in low settings.
---
They only replied to 1 person on reddit. So only takes 2 seconds by clicking "show thread".

Mostly I believe this is another reddit myth like the trade-steal  exploit myth.

Yes, really low quality actually, the stripe is like tape, and the logo is crooked.

That would explain it for me, the 6600k is getting old.

Well when you have people paying one hundred bucks a year to play a game with features that should be in the base game. You cant blame them for wanting to help those that are their cash cows
---
Bethesda is great bro, I'm not a stupid useless that have money throwed at me, FO76 could not be better and what bethesda is doing just improves the franchise and is best for every player in the world!

So he should change his Nvidia settings.

I'm also EST. 9-12 works great for me. Might not always be on due to responsibilities. GT is ShadowCore67
---
Yeah, my performance (XBox) on the event is terrible.  I started just jumping on top of the Whitespring and waiting for everyone else to finish the event.  Haven't crashed since doing that.
---
Seriously I don't know why this game is so hardware demanded when something like Metro series looks waaaaay better.
---
First day, out of the 8 times I played, 4 of them were crashes either near the end of the event or when I got downed and someone was reviving me
---
Bethesda is not being proactive when they released Fallout 1st or when they added P2W elements in the atomic shop. 
---
Please please teach us how to be proactive.
---
I think it's pretty obvious I didn't pay. That being said I have a very suspicious feeling the game as is now is what you and I will get forever, and any future updates will be just for fo1st players. Regardless of the fact that I've already spent money in the atomic shop on good faith thats what would help pay for updates.
---
Server crashed.
---
Just stand in the courtyard and wait for the legendary.
---
Fuck, if people actually paid me to defend bethesda, I'd be rich.
---
Reddit actually actively prevents that type of practice from going on. They have tools in place just for detecting it and moderating it. So. No. You're just outraged, and maybe 2 dozen other people. Because you don't know what you're talking about.
---
You weren't lied to. They aren't doing anything wrong. Get over yourself.
---
Oh no, I think the color is the difference. 
---
The not-working-with-hats/helmets is yet another example of shoddy attention to detail. It should be the same for both masks.
---
So quit supporting companies that have terrible policies, microtrans, and greedy predatory subscriptions. They will go away if people stop choosing dumb shit.

So one guy telling you he went to a class and did a thing on reddit....

Exactly. Wish I had so few issues that a piece of entertainment not being entertaining was enraging. Worse yet, getting mad at other people enjoying it. It's entertainment, if you don't like it, then it has no value to you and you have no reason to engage with it.
---
UK here (so +5 hours?) I'm usually on around 9pm - 3am, and anytime over the weekend.
---
Like you don't know. The answer is to stop playing the game. Submit Feedback through official channels (there forums or tickets).
---
Yes, this. I miss the old one with the plane. One of the first few places I found when I stayed playing was that blue and yellow plane. I felt so accomplished that day.
---
Didn't say that.
---
All I'm witnessing is the same slow evolution that ESO had when it started.  It will fill out over this year and become more stable.  Fans will come back, haters will hate etc.  five years down the road it will be a classic and nobody will remember the B's we dealt with.  Just like eso.  
---
Or I'm bass ackwards🤷
---
In subnautica, sitting pauses any hunger or thirst meters.
---
I haven't crashed during this event yet, but twice this week I was in the middle of a SBQ battle, almost ready to finisher her off and BOOM, crash. I have not been more angry at a game that I want to like so badly. 
---
It's like every other patch fucks the game to the point of constant crashing. The worst is not being able to quickly reconnect to the same god damn server you were on. I would have had enough time to get back tot he fight. Seriously, what kind of idiot company makes that option not available? Bethesda does, they are that idiot company.
---
What platform are you playing on? I’ve done the event a bunch of time with no game breaking bugs. The only issue was sometimes the forks done appear.
---
There is 2 color types of urban masks. Which i have screenshots upper there in comments so i believe color is not the difference? Or the another mask i have is bugged?
---
I didn’t want to say their lying as maybe they do believe that’s the reason. But all the players that hate FO1ST have according to the 100s of post have left and uninstalled the game. The people left playing who don’t have FO1ST obviously don’t care about it.
---
Yeah,. I am still holding to my 7700k because I don't want to drop cash on anew Mobo for next gen CPU,s.
---
Ive been doing it 2-3 times each hour. It is laggy af on public server tho. lol something players know about explosions which devs seems to have missed.
---
we want a weekly series
---
The reason is the money spent on this game. Maybe you don't care about that but most times people do.
---
What bugs me is how in a lot of recent fallout promotionial material it seems like they just reused a lot of simple templates of vault boy in photoshop instead of getting someone to actually draw it. Look at the Nuclear Winter poster for example, it looks cheap.
---
So now that one youtuber is sitting there telling you shit with the disclaimer that he's only a business STUDENT, everyone throws this out there...  
---
Ugh.
---
Nope. There's two guys now.
---
Yea. That we'll have to have you come join us sometime soon. This current vault raid kind of blows, so a lot of us wont be playing it. Lol. Whats your GT, ill send you a message when i get home and add you.
---
Ehhh, I'm not upset about it. It's a different experience than a couple of days into the first Meat Week where no one really knew what they were supposed to do and the event failed more often than not. The instructions are clear and it's leveled so that everyone can participate.
---
I don’t think anyone who read my post got the wrong impression of the state of the game, had the PR and Marketing been better and honest the backlash over these issues would not be nearly as severe. I understand that people are angry about the game, I am too, but it’s not a reason to randomly attack each other over petty stuff like that.
---
I think this was a response to the VTU rewards being so easy. That said, if they're hard, they shouldn't be so heavily constricted on time to complete them.
---
Are u me?
---
Soooo.... Just like the game's engine?
---
Yep. Same. I need that 5 scrip from the 1*  lol

I got called a shill in a thread where people were accusing players of being PR shills because of a thread of a guy saying he was paid to be a PR shill with multiple accounts

it's not an insult I'm just trying to have some fun, my brother is a cop and makes a good living. also police are not as psycho gun happy as the media makes them out to be but it's just fun to call people a cop. or a mark ass trick or a trick ass mark. or my favorite, a buster.

Yea. That we'll have to have you come join us sometime soon. This current vault raid kind of blows, so a lot of us wont be playing it. Lol. ill send you a message when i get home and add you. And thats fine, we all understand and are with you on having other responsibilities taking priority first.
---
Yeah, and it's still severely broken, even by Bethesda standards
---
side note, I've been having a good laugh at all your comments today.  Your a funny dude, keep that shiz up and good hunting
---
2 people saying somethign on reddit...
---
Its crashed for me about 50% of the time, but I justed logged back in and have been able to finish all but one time out of maybe 15 attempts.
---
Me and my team all have strangler heart power armor and all the plans we mastered the 1and 3 raid the 2 is really bad.
---
I’ve got the first 3 now, it took 8 games, one of which was a win. This is gonna be a long few days between university and trying to get this armour 😂
---
Yeah. For me, I'm in the middle of not caring and not having the money to pay fot. All I'd like from it is the monthly atom drop and the ranger outfit.
---
Awesome thanks
---
I am not part of the pr team, in fact I had a post ranting with 500+ upvotes, but seriously things are blown out of proportion and the idiots yelling P2W pains me.
---
thank you for being real
---
I've wanted an upgrade for a while too, but the gain was just not worth the cost. Very seldom is 4 cores at 4.6 not enough for 4k gaming. A few more fps, a small percentage of times, is just not justifiable to the $1000.
---
RNG is a bitch, ain't it? i remember getting like 15 of the meat week flag plans.
---
I feel like a combo of sprinting, jumping, and exploding cars is what causes it on Xbox. If you just walk and shoot the cars it hasn't crashed for me. As soon as I add jumping or sprinting it's game over.
---
Bethesda is not going to make updates to the game Fallout first only, that's a shit storm no one would like to see.
---
Fallout first people might get other forms of new things in the future, such as a leaked ranger outfit skin.
---
Weird, I thought I read it was only available til the 5th... god at this point it wouldn’t surprise me if it just disappeared tomorrow and Bethesda told us we read it wrong lol
---
Girl, you's a buster. Y'all out here taking people's info for improving your game and then making them pay for it why should we trust anything you say? Next thing you know you'll be having us put bills on it to get it fixed. The Free People wanna be free!

remember eso wasn't stable for a long time.

It does. Any outfit you get from Mschief Night counts as a costume. Even the suits.

Wife stealing all your exp? Sounds like a pro gamer. You picked a good one sir.

I've tried the nit running tactic and I still crash. This last event I crashed while picking from a trick or treat bowl.

I always love seeing positive stuff on this subreddit, makes me have hope for the fan base
---
was fine for me
---
That’s odd... I won 1 round and played 8 rounds (all keeping within the top 4) and got the first 3 skins 🤔
---
exactly, it wasn't good for awhile.  however in time, just like nms it will become great.
---
For #2, you likely to still have placement problems if you moving camp. Just build a blueprint specifically for your extractor area and worse case is you break down the blueprint and just rebuild it using the pieces it will put in storage. Same goes with your house etc, it is unlikely to place in a new area and you going to have to break it down and just replace it.
---
Just remember to always put everything on a foundation as much as possible, especially things like generators. Crops and purifiers can't, so you risk losing these still. Everything else should be placed on a foundation if possible.
---
You may or may not get lucky with placement, it's dependent on your build
---
"BUT THEN ITS TOO EASY TO LEVEL FOR NEW PLAYERS" - all the crybabies. I'm level 400. I don't care. I just want to be able to farm and not have to wait for the low levels to tag everything before killing stuff.

Holy cow, that's a steal
---
I thought it was just my Xbox yesterday
---
Fair enough
---
Oh that's great!  I just got the suit the full one it's really nice.  Cheers for the reply.
---
i think they added something in the settings that lets you turn it down/off. not really the same as changing it but. if you prefer silence over the NW theme, it's great.
---
Notice how they magically showed up and started responding to others after the post pointing that out?
---
Didn't that happen already?
---
I've only had one repeat pumpkin drop in 15 events
---
So far I gotten everything except the pirate hat
---
I'am not familliar with the ESO History and i know compared to ESO the pricing is about the same. But as a Fallout fan who bought this under false promises of bethesda i'am not going to forgive or forget that. I don't even know if i would buy Starfield given the total loss in Thrust to this company.

What's so hard to believe about companies using social media and viral marketing to advertise their products? This is the internet in 2019. Are you honestly surprised?
---
Oh please, not everything is a conspiracy
---
Crashed on me last night. It was a server crash because I was still alive and had my loot 10 minutes later after rebooting
---
Right but they got you locked in once you start abusing your stash limit. Good luck going back!
---
And to think we all were duped into believing it would lag the server. This was the plan all along.
---
Huh, I wish I had only 2 extra people. Seems like whole server converges on it.
---
Have gotten over 130 3 star ranged since I got the fixer plan....no fixer from purveyor yet.
---
I’m my own thing!
---
I’m making assumptions here, but I’m pretty sure a community manager ain’t making any decisions about monetization. I bet they just tossed her the keys to the flaming limo they just made and said “deal with it.”
---
if you want them to focus on fixing, how can they also focus on talking with us.  one or the other
---
At the Halloween event, theres a trunk that give you a tinfoil hat, I think the lizard people at Bethesda may have fought through the brainwave distortion on yours, best get another for save measure. Damn globalists
---
Damn. So far I'm about 6/15 completion rate on public servers. Did it a few times with my friend on his private one and it did run so much smoother. I'm still not gonna pay for it tho
---
I’ll buy one! It’s the last I need. I have other plans for trade too
---
nuke the crash
---
Nah, I wouldn't be so sure about that. I saw a guy yesterday lugging around a Ultracite Gatling during Mischief Night, and his bullets (er, *lasers*) were exploding. So I guess they exist in *some* capacity
---
Didn't say anything was a conspiracy, just pointing out they went radio silent for over a week and only responded to fo1st users having log on issues when that post was posted. You can easily check the "bethesda replied" bot to verify it yourself.
---
EA killed studios, Bethesda hasn't.
---
I did it once by myself on my server but i went through a lot of aid supplies doing it solo.
---
Oh absolutely I mean it took me a few hours to get up to 1500 xp to get todays unlock.  I don't even feel like I'll get half way to the 14k xp.  It's not really my thing in the first place I just want to get the sweet unlocks then just have my usual fun in adventure.  I don't like pvping as I'm not really good as I don't really care for it.
---
I was bummed to see 14k xp for the last item that is upsetting for sure.
---
*buy an absolutely terribly valued $12.99 a month subscription to one of the buggiest games on the market that has content that should’ve been in the game day one*
---
Oh gee I can’t believe the subscription is buggy!
---
Hearing your kids screaming in the background / your spouse screaming back at them, dogs barking, police sirens going off, or just some rando typing hard on a mechanical keyboard or munching on doritios while mouth breathing ruins my immersion in the game and bothers me more than words can express. Voice comms with friends - that's fine. Voice comms with randos - no thanks. 
---
Not to mention defa people.
---
Seriously why is that still up  what are we even paying the mods for err I mean
---
There's no actual proof and that post that is a PR shill. In fact anyone could easily create that.
---
J/K but seriously anyone could've created that post and most likely it was someone farming Karma and making it up. 
---
Why would I come to that conclusion? Three letters NDA. Or non-disclosure agreement.
---
Anyone who Bethesda actually pays to do this (they exist every company has them I'm not disputing that.) Would sign an NDA. I've signed a few myself (trade secrets for the companies I've worked for) 
---
The penalties for violating a NDA is usually pretty severe. A violation of a NDA would be pursued by Bethesda and thier lawyers. 
---
I wouldn't risk being on the receiving end of that.
---
Now I don't see how every positive post is a Shill (some probably are IDK for sure) How is it not possible for players to enjoy the game or not be bothered by FO1st one way or the other?
---
It's more likely a 50/50 split or you know obviously PR Shills.
---
I don’t doubt that you’re correct. But I do doubt the motivations you put forward
---
nice! i’ll be on around 4ish est
---
They should have released them in the oposite order, you will have until Nov 12th to do the challanges... infact, if you wait for all of them to be released and only start playing when the last has dropped you will actually be saving time... Ill only play when the last is released.
---
Bethesda hasn't killed studios under their banner like EA.  
---
EA also has Star Wars Battlefront 2, they were starting to get mad when Anthem wasn't hitting deadlines and want Anthem to last 10 years, bioware might close down due to Anthem's failures.
---
Just keep griefing and murdering every subscriber you see.
---
I run them a couple of times a week on the second and third weeks. So maybe a 6/10? Mainly to farm acid from the bugs then get killed and leave it. 
---
Week 1 isn't that fun, maybe a 4, week 2 isn't very fun, maybe a 3, and week 3 I found to be pretty much an 8, I really enjoy it. 
---
Never had any trouble except the lag in week 2. The only bugs I've ever encountered are the ones that spawn indefinitely
---
1, 3  
---
Tried it originally - hampered by me not really playing with a steady group of people or teaming at all on the regular. The experience was overshadowed by huge delays when anything needed activating.
---
I also immensely dislike any game modes that just spawn in more and more enemies. I prefer to clear out and proceed.
---
And dealing with bullet sponge enemies has never been appealing at all, either. If i have to empty a whole clip into a bloodbug to kill it, something's wonky.
---
It starts, but due to the countdown (it stays until proced for about 30 min) an untouched private server will still allow the event to run up until about 30 mins past. We clear the event in about 8 min so we have time to proc 2-3 on private servers after starting it on a public.
---
Nuke Todd :)
---
All for this
---
Fun fact, having to pay $100 more for this game to have it work smoothly is complete bullshit. Just saying, but glad it works for you.
---
My tag is prophesied_kyros, id have no problem helping
---
I mean, we gloss over the fact that “give the players what they want” would be met with a stream of applause and upvotes. That’s the only acceptable answer for your already pissed off and slighted fan base.
---
I've completed 7 and only experienced slight lag twice. (XB1)
---
You can turn it off in the settigs.
---
Holy crap i didn't even think about the pip boy. Text chat would EVEN BE LORE FRIENDLY!
---
I like that aspect of it.
---
You must have never worked in customer service, if you think major companies don't pay attention to what is being said about them. Which means they are going to try to minimize blow back after they already made a very unpopular decision.
---
That’s not true! They replied to an issue with the item shop, so they defined care about their F2P community!
---
Gumdrops
---
Lots of Gumdrops
---
Oh, and Cotton Candy Bites
---
I feel like doing the rewards one day at a time was one of the worst decisions they could have done. Why make it so we can't unlock the skeleton costume the first day of the Halloween event? Who's going to wear it once all the spooky stuff is over? I agree the XP is too high, but at least give us more time to unlock it if it is going to be that much
---
Not noticed anything.
---
Keep in mind that Reddit is just a tiny tiny peortion of the players. Even tho Reddit belives its "everyone".
---
Never managed to complete one... time races are stupid and no checkpoint are worse... I dont do them mainly for this... no checkpoints and race againts the clock... but mostly for checkpoints. And no rejoin
---
If you talking about the basic training at Camp McClintoc , you need to complete all the training missions else it will restart from the beginning.
---
Yeah but I also want the old music back
---
Definitely for sure.
---
thanks for the link!
---
Yeah, locations you have to travel to... The tent can be dropped right outside almost any location negating most all required travel.
---
You don't have to pay if you have friends with private servers, just communicate and figure out a rotation. We do public, my server, player 2's server, player 3's server, and an attempt on player 4's. In our group we have 7-8 people in each private instance with only about half having fo1st.
---
I know they pay attention. I just think it’s coincidence. I may be wrong. But I have no concrete evidence to the contrary
---
Yeah, it's a private server instance those aren't free in anything.  Folks keep getting confused between peer-to-peer and server based.
---
PS4 Pro and I get crashed approximately 50% of the time in the event,   Less so in general gameplay - about every two hours
---
Okay, it just bugged me I have friends who are police and firemen. I'm happy your Brother serves his community. It's a tough job.
---
Yes the media make all Police look like racist monsters. It's quite awful.
---
TBH I'd rather have been called a "mark ass trick" I like that one and would've laughed.
---
I pre-ordered one, but when delivered it was a paper cup.....
---
Same for me
---
just a fyi in case you weren't aware.  Sentinel doesn't work if you're crouched.  hope it helps
---
I'm griefing as much as possible
---
ah nice tip, thanks
---
Better then staring at a pipe in Tea time... waiting for another bug to pop up... some events are so stupid... like Death Blossoms.
---
the only issue i really see mentioned in the OP is lack of people.
---
as far as rewards go, i can gaurentee if we had 96 with the datamined frost armor everyone would be running the raids to get the freeze effect, and rewards would be a non issue.  
---
imo the 94 rewards would be fine if you could get unyield on the thorn set. (solar unyield would be useless lol) most of the people i see who hate the rewards are people running bloodied with mixed/full unyield/bolstering.
---
right now for PA users the difference in defence is next to nothing, but you get a dps boost from the set.  a solar/vanguard(and sent) is stupidly strong for full hp builds, you can pretty much ignore most damage sources.
---
Nice profile
---
Oh my God YES. They also missed out on letting us plant pumpkins at our camps :(
---
Add me.  iheartexo
---
This happened to me and I literally just got the game  what a waste of money tbh spent a whole day downloading it and now I cant even play it
---
Their actions show it is more than likely. As as soon as that post got traction they then start responding to others. After the days and days of radio slence for them to start responding to everyone a couple hours after that post shows more than mere coincidence.
---
Look up occams razor.
---
Yes sometimes located in the building.
---
That's extremely irresponsible on the companies part then.
---
Other than color they *SHOULD* be identical.
---
In reality the forest does not mix with helmets while the urban does. I chose to believe it's an oversight in part of whoever worked on them, missed a tickbox or something minor like that.
---
I myself use the welders helmet with the urban. I was looking forever for the forest version because the colors match better. I was really disappointed to learn i can't wear it and the helmet. Put in a ticket for it, but who knows if that ever gets any attention..
---
I haven't gotten the same thing yet plan wise. Not sure what I've got so far but it's always a new plan. I just learn them as I get them.
---
Looks better on a black guy.
---
All I buy are 3☆ ranged I have no idea how many I've bought.I turn in max scrip daily so it's a lot. 
---
I want a legendary fixer badly. But I'm not paying the market prices.
---
So that's why all of mine were empty :)
---
I really wanted to make a pumpkin patch camp with all these new plans.. but I found out the other day you can’t plant pumpkins! Sucks :(
---
It's not limited to just dying to the Sentrybot

---
Good
---
It sucks :( I've been wanting to be able to plant pumpkins since BETA! Pumpkin soup FTW ✊🏻
---
it’s so damn baller!
---
Someone pays. So your advice is to mooch. Obviously I'm an asshole and have no friends. (For real no F76 friends that have 1st)
---
Would love some pumpkin plans to buy if you're sharing.  I'm on ps4.
---
I’m well aware of Occam’s razor. I disagree however that the simplest solution is that they are begrudgingly addressing the event issues (which some people have had, I haven’t experienced them). I reckon they just hadn’t gotten to it till now.
---
I would have thought it would be the canvas that they didn't use on the bags ;)
---
Is that the only reply you can come up with when someone disagrees with you?
---
Fantastic! Completely enables both my procrastination *and* laziness!
---
Tbh, I'd say FO4 is probably my least favorite of all of them from an RPG standpoint. It really felt like it was making the hard turn into the FPS looter-shooter lane away from the RPG lane. To me at least. Loosing both karma *and* reputation as well as skills? Big ouch to the RPG department.
---
Now, don't get me wrong, I enjoy FO4. But it's not my favorite just because it felt like a lot of what I loved about the series got ditched in favor of lowest-common-denominator FPS looter shooter mashed up with a (very limited) town builder/city manager game.
---
What if the game was free, would you pay then ?
---
Open world vs linear levels. It makes perfect sense.
---
Linear levels are small so they can put more detail into each one. Better lighting, more objects, higher quality textures.
---
Well you're not everyone. It happened to people and just because you people didn't see it doesn't mean it didn't happen to others. I've had my workshops taken and forced pvp, had desocrated camps, grief attempts and verbal insults
---
Except they have reals before feels.
---
God if that happened to me it would actually make my day. All people leave in my camp are spoiled food, like PUT IT OUTSIDE lol 😂
---
doesn't need to be an enemy.  had some awesome player spawn on my camp and shot my Brahmin with it and after a few respawns of said Brahmin we got a legendary to spawn.  I was blown away that I didn't know it was possible.
---
I stopped even considering giving them money for atoms as soon as they introduced repair kits. So they won't be getting a dime from me on principle already. I've stopped playing when Fallout first was introduced. To be fair, I may come back if wastelanders is good but I'm pissed off that they keep adding pay stuff but nothing to the game that you actually play for (or multiplayer stuff which I'm totally not interested in). I mean I know they got to make money but we still have the same plans and stuff to play for since spring which means for those of us who have been playing a while, there's nothing new to play for even (if you don't want to do the multiplayer stuff).    
---
They want me to pay even if they hadn't broken promises and made me decide not to pay on principle, they have to add to the game... not just add stuff for me to buy. I got my 60 bux out of it. But they want more money, they need to add more content that I want to play. It's offensive they think I should pay to keep playing the same game I already played for 100's of hours. There's only so much of doing the same thing I can do before I move on.
---
When it comes to why players are getting duplicates of a specific plan from Mischief Night, it comes down to RNG and the fact that each reward drawing is independent of each other so it is possible to get a specific plan or item often within x number of completions. Explaining it in more detail:
---
The 10 jack-o-lantern and 5 pumpkin rack plans are in one of three reward pools that are for a successful completion of Mischief Night when wearing a costume item. That pool has an 80% chance of getting a plan from with each plan having an equal chance of being given. 80% divided by 15 is about 5.333% (five and one-third). The other two item pools are a grim reaper vault boy cardboard cutout plan that has a 10% of being awarded while the final 10% probability goes to 2 pumpkin suits, the pirate hat, and pirate costume which have only a 2.5% chance of getting a specific costume item.
---
While there are 20 rewards, the odds imply that it takes an average of 40 completions to obtain every exclusive plan and item at least once with 20 completions being the best case situation though it is possible to complete the event 80+ times and still not get an item or two due to how RNG works.
---
From my 25 completions of the event, I've obtain 4 pumpkin rack plans, 7 jack-o-lantern plans, the cardboard cutout plan, and both of the pirate costume items with my duplicate plans as follows:
---
* 5 alien jack-o-lantern plans
---
* 3 cardboard cutout plans
---
* 1 classic jack-o-lantern plan
---
* 1 Vault-tec jack-o-lantern plan
---
* 1 vault boy jack-o-lantern plan
---
Rest assured that you are not the only person getting a high number of duplicates of a specific jack-o-lantern plan. There is always the options to trade with other players that are missing plans you have in exchange for plans that you do not have and sell the duplicate plans once the event is over with.
---
Yep, it's says a lot of bad things about the human mind that it's common for folks to enjoy watching darker emotions flare-up.  Guess I'm old enough that it's still weird seeing entertainment news, reality tv, or these social media hate storms.
---
Agreed, especially when the subscription costs more for much less. We got an entire game for less .. not sure if. I am comparing apples to apples which it is not, but sure seems more expensive. For me would be $129 a year CDN or $17.50 a month, it's hard to justify for me.
---
That is truly the equivalent 😂
---
They've missed so many opportunities in the atomic shop at this point, it's not surprising in the slightest.
---
Well maybe my example is wrong, take Warframe as an example then.
---
I have a 162 member Discord so we have a bunch of people on at any given time. We cooperate and coordinate a lot of events (SBQ, Arktos, Faschnacht, Meat Week, etc) we found out that we can run the event 3-4 times and I just wanted to share.
---
I'm waiting for it to come to switch. Sure, it will be a downgrade, but as long is it is graphics only I'm fine with that in trade for being able to take it with me on vacations and such.
---
It is very weird how there's still a large selection of plants you can't grow crops for.
---
Same thing.
---
I feel like this can be the Joker suit.
---
Or kill the game entirely as there simply wouldn't be enough subs to sustain the game long term.
---
No, Waframe does have open world maps.
---
It removes the army clothes from your inventory too?
---
Thar ya Go!!
---
Atom Bomb Baby herself,so anyone sayin the OP was a Beth shill or whatever...
---
There’s yer proof otherwise.
---
Beautiful story
---
Happy Halloween
---
Stay Blessed
---
hasn't crashed for me once. I'm on PC.
---
Nah I don't think it is, just an idea from his perspective .. he could be trolling, but I don't he is ..
---
Yeah this is a likely outcome.
---
I've tried 3 discords and noting really happened, but ty for tip. Probably would work out if I put more effort in. Still, making friends just so I can get on their server for a smoother game play is wack.
---
Then they just a bunch of mark ass tricks.
---
Of course not, they were too busy replying to fo1st members to reply to lowly free event issues. It is far too coincidental for them to start responding to others only directly after that post. You'd have a point if this didn't happen literally more than half way through the work week. If it was on a Monday or Tuesday I'd agree with you. But, they went 4 days into this work week and only replied to non 1st issues after that post. But were replying to 1st members nearly 36 hours before.
---
It shouldn't take more than 10 seconds to copy and paste their normal reply of "the devs are aware of the issue and looking for a fix" they copy and paste. So them only now having time is just a silly excuse and doesn't really work when they just copy canned responses.
---
You are being risky there as gamers love CDPR for the things they represent to them, but I am glad you are willing to see beyond how they treat customers to how they treat employees. Honestly, I'll admit I like some of CDPR's policies but I also realize they do it for the good PR and there is the niche for the "good guy developer" that will make them money just from the good will built. It's sad that they are not so easy on their employees :(.
---
from myth into legend XD
---
good to know you mark ass trick lol
---
3x3 km map. That is smaller than Fallout 3, by like 4 times.
---
Small map, more detail allowed.
---
Did you complete all 4 missions ? If not it will reset and yes I believe it removes the clothes as well as if you never did the mission. You need to complete it in one sitting .. happened to me a few times on my various characters ..
---
Lol
---
It's not bullying, if you cannot do PvP, don't touch them.
---
Alright, I'll take your word for it. I'd feel better if you called someone stupid, on r/worldnews or something though.
---
I stopped playing because a really high level guy built his camp right above mine (like up on a cliff) and every time I logged in he would blast me and my camp with rocket launchers over and over and over again. It sucked.
---
"Everyone who doesn't share my opinion is a paid shill"
---
Fuck outta here Lorax
---
How large it is doesn't matter after a certain size, because the load distance will not cover it all.
---
People I respect on YT, mostly Bethesda vlogs, etc. Are now openly saying that Bethesda are dead to them, that Obsidian have made RPG's relevent again. A few are even calling Bethesda overtly "evil" which is long way to fall, when even your own fanbase is against you, you have a lot to prove. 
---
Still, there will be content and new lands and adventure for years to come with Skyrim, and A Tale of Two Wastelands once I get bored of high fantasy. Not to mention Witcher 3, Red Dead 2, Skywind, Skyblivion, and Oblivion's latest to play should I need diversion.
---
Mods don't have paying customers, only patreons in a few cases.
---
Honestly those people don't frustrate me as much as they, "you're just jealous I have the money and that's the only reason it is offensive" and refuse to see why this stuff is a bad thing. At least the ones who see the problem have a chance to eventually realize enough is enough (or only cave when it's something they really really want).... it's the ones I talk about that are the ones that throw the most money at these things as they see no problem and feel they don't need to watch what they spend.
---
You's a trick ass mark. Real recognize real and you ain't it buster.
---
omg i can't... breathe.... this is so good.  state of the world today buy a game and if it doesn't have safe spaces included call it online bullying... lmao.     i can't wait to see this on the call of duty forums 'this guy shot me... i'm bullied' lmao omg.
---
Having to load more models and higher res textures does matter.
---
Vote with your wallet, the only way to get better games is to stop buying them and make them earn your money.
---
No didn’t complete it all. Well that explains it. I’ll remember to complete areas in one sitting then. Thank you very much!
---
No, the earlier games, especially Fallout: New Vegas, (built by Obsidian) are very good.
---
how the turn tables
---
upvote for use of "Delta"
---
You know they're gonna charge money for this right?
---
Seems like a legit lie
---
i got the pirate costume, not sure if that's a rare one.
---
I think we’re just seeing things differently on this one. And honestly I don’t think either of us are going to sway the other. Cheers mate! Have good morning/evening wherever you are!
---
that's my issue too.  GD twitchy finger
---
So people who bought the game aren’t paying customers anymore? Lmao. I bought the $120 version of this piece of shit game the tricentennial version, because I have a love for fallout. But it was just an empty game, full of empty promises. Go play outer worlds it’s 100 times better
---
2/10 About as believable as the op!
---
And the literal extra minute of travel is an unfair advantage? What about the mods that PC has that console do not?
---
don't worry, they didn't send them anything.
---
On average YOU get 140 xp per match lol. I’m around 450. Not great but damn 150? Lol
---
I bought FO 1st. Mainly for the stash.. Actually the only reason at first. Then i figured "Hmm, but now i can farm all that stuff i want on private server with no \*\*\*-hole being there cleaning it out before me". Then i found the atoms.. I've bought 2 items so far, i got 1900 atoms left. And honestly, even if I have the atoms, I refuse to spend it on non-sale items. I just won't. And I hate it, that even if I *can* buy it, I don't feel it's worth it. Sad.  
---
And one more thing. I read through your whole post, and It's good. Didn't even think of it this way.
---
Yeah on public server you are MUCH more likely to crash from my and my friends exprience. One of my friends has crashed 4 out of the 7 times he's done the event.
---
As others have said in here, this is a known bug we are investigating.
---
Cheers for the info, thanks! Yeah I'm planning to re-build in the same spot. I'll prob make several blueprints, with and without the Extractor, and go from there! See what works. Thanks again!
---
&gt;Three letters NDA. Or non-disclosure agreement.
---
&gt;I wouldn't risk being on the receiving end of that.
---
And at the same time you're criticising them for posting anonymously on reddit. What a genius.
---
&gt;Now, before anybody gives me the totally BS argument that "you take the workshop, you agreed to PvP," let me just lead with your argument is completely flawed, sorry. That argument is comparable to saying if you buy a car, and it gets stolen, then it's your fault because you know cars can get stolen, so don't blame the thief. WTF? NO. Make that argument and you get downvoted. It's not fooling anybody.
---
Not a bullshit arguement. And completely different from getting a car stolen. 
---
When you buy a car does a pop up tell you this will "initialize car theft". 
---
Isn't it also against the law to steal a car?
---
Work shop PvP is clearly stated and is well within the rules of 76's game play. They're not a safe space and they don't need to be one.
---
Explosions never used to be a problem in the early days.
---
really? i literally just joined today because i bought fo76 last week a day before the fallout 1st announcement. the price also dropped 10 dollars but here i am telling you about it. why is the sub so ridiculous? i suppose ill need all the help i can get since i am yet to even start the game
---
Can't believe its not butter.
---
No for 2 reasons: first, the game isn't free and changing it now would be another shot to the knee by BGS (I think they're already out of knees to shoot) - I would demand compensation, not in useless atoms for sure. Second, I usually buy games after some time, when they cost ~50% of premiere price, so I did with F76. I hate all the pseudo-free sale models where you either have to pay for subscription or progress is almost impossible without paying with real money. Maybe it's old-school thinking, but I buy games that I can resell later or at least spend so much time in it, it's worth the money spend. That's why I don't use steam and similar shops where you "borrow" games (they're never yours, you can't do anything with it, you just have access to it). I played Diablo 3 for 3 years and after I quit I sold the account for ~$450. If I won't be able to sell the F76 account when I decide to quit, I'll make huge giveaway ;)

---
 &gt; As others have said in here, this is a known bug we are investigating.
---
Yeah that's the only mission I know of that you have to complete it fully, didn't have any issues with other missions like Roses for example, so don't worry about doing it for all the quests, it's only this one for some reason by design.
---
Ur pc is wooden
---
I'm going to toss my hat into this mix now, a lot of the complaints in this thread are just silly. Bethesda said they wouldn't make you pay for DLC or extra content, etc. But what they don't mention is Bethesda has released Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter then there is Wastelanders coming. So, Bethesda has tried to fix their mistakes they are adding more content which in previous games would be DLC that you would pay for. 
---
From a business side Fallout, 76 has been a flop. Most customers I would imagine have gotten the game for far less than $60. GameStop Germany was giving it away for free with a used controller purchase. You can easily get the game for $10-$20.

Not only that but I found in many stores a Fallout 76 bundled Xbox Console was cheaper than the standard console. I personally got my copy for $20. 
---
Not only that but Bethesda isn't exactly a master of the Game as a service market so them selling it or practically giving it away damaged them financially. I would argue Fallout 1st isn't content per se. It's annoying that certain features notably the unlimited scrap box is locked behind a paywall but I wouldn't say it was content. If they said Wasterlanders could only be accessible to Fallout 1st subscribers that would be an issue. 
---
I think Fallout 76 sucked at launch, Bethesda is trying to fix it which btw they haven't made an online persistent world type game before there is a big learning curve. They also aren't well experienced at games as a service but the game is still playable and for $20 that I paid for it I have gotten a substantial amount of playtime out of the game so it was well worth the $20.
---
It is a game. This isn't bullying. No one was forcing the kid to keep going back to the workshop. The solution is to leave. The point of the workshops was to be fought over, and if you cant defend it, you lose it.
---
Dont be a snowflake.
---
This literally *cannot* happen. 
---
Stop making shit up.
---
Well it isn't. I had already beaten most of the main story and was just playing because I love fallout and for 2 days this guy bullied me out of wanting to play.
---
Oh alright, that’s not so bad then!

And if you're dead and respawning , nobody is in the area!

Considering I work for my money, I earn anything I spend it on.

Stop over reacting. You're literally being a tool right now.

Damn... looks like they will have to use the servers they paid for what a shame..
---
This is what's wrong with the world reeeee I need ma safe space. Fuck out of here with that bullshit
---
I sued you, like you instructed
---
Seems kind of crazyl to waste your time on something as stupid as this.
---
1 and 2. 
---
Bugs and resources aren’t worth it, especially for a melee build. My friends expended tons of bullets trying to clear it, and 2/3 crashed.
---
How do u know it's not just a trap for hapless do gooders and why don't u put some blame on a kids parents who listen to that nonsense and do nothing assuming it wasn't just bait in the first place.
---
I've done it about as many times as you and have had zero crashes as well, and I'm also on the One X.
---
I hope that’s the case, I just wanted to give a bare minimum suggestion considering suggestions as of late have been barely even looked at lol
---
for real.  talk about choosingbeggars
---
Yeah I am with you, I can easily afford stuff, but with anything I prefer to buy things outright and own them and I absolutely hate subscriptions for anything, it's good for companies and making money and sustaining their business model, but it is not good for my business (my bank account). It's obviously cheaper for me to buy it once and own it .. but even with digital now, I don't really own it and can't resell it unless as you said an account but likely will never sell it but at least I think in the most part I own the games at least the right to play.
---
I also have the old school thinking and I also only play very few games, my gaming costs are generally less then $100-$200 for the last 5 years .. I really don't buy many games at all. I know people who literally spend 1000's on games, content, cosmetics, I just can't do it, it's just a game and should be included with the freaking game instead of these greedy cash grabs. I have always said I will quit and change games if I am forced to pay more than my entry ticket.
---
;-;
---
how did you get it free?
---
Oh ffs, just find a YouTube video that plays the old music and have it on constant rewind. The music on a menu isn’t THAT big of a problem.
---
As you said, the game has to load on the go, so while in the same spot, or when moving just for a short distance, the performance shouldn't be affected by map size that much. 
---
Maybe Fallout 76 has more destails and stuff, but it doesn't look that much better, considering the hardware requirement difference.
---
My fiancé would definitely be a lot happier if she was able to get something as well so fingers crossed, but at this point I’m just hoping something is done at all
---
Nice one, thanks very much! I'm also a crafter and can always help out with any Power Armor and other things/mods, ammo etc. And I have F1st if that's handy for the Private World. GT JaggersLips13

some forbes writer just so happened to be watching a stream of a fallout first player who was mentioning this rivalry between players. and then they proceeded to write an article on it. i completely made this all up but honestly this is how most gaming news happens
---
Lmao I god damn let that fly over my own head 😂
---
It's not like the OP hasn't hinted towards shill accounts in the past.

Also has lots of pics and vids of thier dog on reddit. I'm certain they've never showed those to a co-worker. There's more info as well if I had time I could probably find OP's gamer tag.
---
If it was a shill I doubt they would've used thier personal reddit account. It would've been a throw away which as a shill myself I know are easy to create
---
Some of the pumpkin plans are not working as well. I've crashed several times causing a loss of reward, and the times I've gotten rewards it seems I've leaned some of the plans 2-3x and they still show up as if I don't know them.
---
Honestly I subbed to this sub in the hope for memes. But then just started reading everyone's post and how much fun they're having and it truly made me want to give fallout 76 another try seeing as I havent tried it since launch. But after they released this fallout 1st thing that I know nothing about because I literally haven't been keeping up with the game until now, I think I might just unsub. This is not a fun subreddit.
---
Whataboutism. Irrelevant point.
---
Having access to your stash literally outside most any location IS an advantage. As I said it makes most weight reduction perks irrelevant because you are never more than a few steps from your stash. And it is an advantage because you have to pay a monthly fee to access it.
---
If you cant see this, then you need to get checked.
---
You as well for having an adult conversation that we disagree on yet remained civil. That didn't result in calls of "hater/troll" or "shill/bootlicker".  Not something that happens enough on this sub.
---
Indeed.  Money better put towards a RTX 2080
---
r/whoooosh
---
Why are you spending so much time at the title screen?
---
If you don’t mind me asking, disregarding all the Bethesda stuff going on how is the outer worlds? I’ve had to push back getting it till tomorrow but am a lil concerned about the length. Plus I’d like someone’s opinion other than “I bought it to say fuck bethesda”
---
joke's on you, it's a cosmetic
---
All the Kilpsch stuff can by you a waaaaay better computer though.
---
I'm sorry to hear this. I sincerely hope he gets better.
---
Yeah the other thing I did, not sure it is possible anymore, but I would build my house with nothing inside, no furniture, no machines, just the bare bones building. Make a blue print of an empty house, and then make one with a full house. But my last check is blueprints are too small to hold even a building anymore because it runs out of space, but you can try. I found I Have better luck placing down empty buildings, than buildings with electronics inside of them with generators etc. Even then it's a 50/50 you will ever place it again. I have better luck if you build it on a 1x1 foundation or even a 1x2, but anything more than that, forget it.
---
Go away!
---
1080ti=2080 with rtx off. Not an upgrade.
---
Not a waste if it makes people who buy into Bethesdas PREMIUM service think about what they have done. Guess it is a waste given how thick these people probably are 😂
---
Anyone else think he's full of shit?
---
1) If he was on the same team as the person getting attacked, it would initialize PvP for him too. Passivist mode is bypassed by team aggro.
---
2) Same line of thought, the person would have attacked him too.
---
3) It's more likely, based on the long winded, irrational, irate nature of the post, that he was the one who took a workshop, in passivist mode most likely, and got angry when it didn't protect him from getting his ads handed to him.
---
Moral of the story? Don't take workshops and stick around if you don't want to get ganked.
---
You should definitely be able to play your holotape games while you sit in a chair or on a couch.
---
Events sometimes award legendary loot or give legendary enemies. Look for the event: leader of the pack (3 guaranteed lvl 10 legendaries) and campfire tales (1 level 20 legendary)
---
and posting on the actual forum would work out better for result vs dramatic effect
---
ahhh i see, thanks for this reply!
---
I'm also on PS4 but I have definitely noticed taking more damage than before whilst wearing my full sentinel set.
---
I think Tools come in all flavors of purchasing power...

normally between 11-12 sometimes even a little later

Hopefully Wastlanders Preview at least :/
---
Ill add you when I get home
---
You do realize that the day is still quite young, right?
---
Just waiting on it to be a decent upgrade, very seldom is a 4 core @ 4.6ghz not enough for 4k. I cant justify the 9600k, not enough gains for the cost.
---
Alright sounds good, Ill add you tonight after I get off
---
Get the fuck out of here.
---
 By owning a workshop you agree (by pressing a button mind you) that you are now eligible to engage in PVP.
---
 I do not feel bad for you or the kid since by participating in a workshop you agreed to engage in PVP. It's that freakin simple.
---
 If you don't want anything to do with PVP then stay the hell away from workshops.
---
 I hate PVP myself but I'm smart enough to realize that.
---
Nothing real exciting has been discovered in the game files as of current. What was found has already been posted, but if anything, I'd guess maybe a free icon or something is about as good as we might get. This is just speculation though.
---
ive had it crash several times, and my teammate also had it way worse, she is using PS4 pro so i figured hers would be better but i guess not
---
I literally spend the whole event crouching and staying back until the phase is done because anything else I do it crashes but then again it still crashes even when I do that !
---
if I could craft and gift you the outfit I would
---
They replied to a more recent post on the subject saying they are looking into it
---
Yeah I buy atoms quite a lot so that was a huge bonus. I only want a private server to play with my daughter so it’s hassle free and that’s only every now and again we’ll play. The people that hate it that much aren’t playing, not going out of their way to grief 1sters.
---
Gunplay is solid, story and quests are well written.  I will say it's not quite as open as a Fallout or Elder Scrolls game, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  In about 10-12 hours I've encountered zero bugs ( on ps4 ).  While it doesn't compare to something like Fallout 76, it does compare to Bethesda's single player games.  Peoples biggest complaint will probably be world size ( when comparing to say New Vegas ), but it's really a solid rpg experience overall.
---
For me it's mostly time - I have full-time job, 2 children in school and managing to get enough time to spend in Wasteland is challenge on it's own. When I buy game and pay for it I want it to be mine - I trusted developer and gave him money in advance. Changing model "in the middle of agreement" is unacceptable. Especially when they count on the fact, that people spend so much time in Appalachia and it'll be difficult for them to quit just like that. In that they're actually right - I'm closing to 2k hours of play and it'll be difficult for me to quit right away - I met many nice people there and have some fun. But I've already paid for it - it's like with buying cars - you pay the price, use car and after a year producer asks you for more money to drive it...
---
The explicit purpose of a car is for travel.  Theft of the car is not an expected outcome. 
---
The explicit purpose of workshops is to create a PVP scenario.  PVP is an expected outcome.
---
If you remove PVP, then you will have people just take workshops and then it's NEVER available for someone else until they leave the server.  People will log onto a server and be forced to hop until they found that wasn't taken.  That's a bad idea. 
---
Giving more time to the owner of the workshop gives them an edge because they can then build additional defenses or call allies to help before the PVP begins.  This is also a bad idea.
---
Workshops are fine as they are, it's one of the few places where people interested in PVP could. Of course people take the workshops without the PVP - it's incredibly easy access to resources, in some cases unique things you can't get elsewhere - like rad-free food with no timer, fusion cores, easy access to titanium, or ammo.  That's why PVP is enabled for them.
---
If you want to take away the PVP, then you have to take away the resources.
---
Look for any horde events. There is always a 3 star enemy boss.
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals is what you want. They've got a rule specifically banning this kind of salt, which is refreshing.
---
Tool for who?
---
Maybe a 2080?
---
but the song gets stuck in your head.  I still don't know what the robot says but it sounds like TURTLE POWER from TMNT and I like it.

I was dissapointed Jes-2r was not painted like an eye, or pumpkin, or you know a jester... Paint the eyebot!

All this did was make me wish I hadn't gotten the membership yet so I could get it now out of spite and pettiness. Congrats on the stupid post
---
Wow thank you so much!
---
So we're pissed that they introduce "pay to win" elements, but are equally pissed when they fix "Cheat to win".
---
Truth ^ filthy casuals is awesome. Also happy cake day!
---
So I crashed just chillin on the porch at the resort entrance in the last phase of the event. I was just sitting the crouched waiting for the legendary to spawn. All events so far today I have crashed while in the event.
---
I would love a new trailer since it's being delayed
---
Sad.
---
Without rtx, a 1080ti=2080, so not really an upgrade other than rtx titles, none of which I play.  Trust me as soon as it's worth it, I'll spend again.
---
4k ultra, you're doing good. Interesting, I run ultra too but 1080. You running gsync? That could be why it looks like 60.
---
Not had any problems really, except last night! Loaded in at the Golf Club a little early. Made my way to the Pavilion. Boom, 3 Scorchbeasts (2 Legendary) and an army of Scorched taking on a herd of Ghouls, was an epic battle, before the event even started!
---
-
---
I think I got 5-6 Legendary's in the space of 5mins! Wow!! Still didn't crash haha. I wonder if a player had kite'd them over! HaHa
---
Anything related to Wastlanders is welcome:-)
---
I've crashed in over 10 events.  They next to fix this game ASAP
---
I'm on PS4 slim and I've had it crash twice on me. But even when it is working, the framerate drops make it really hard to do effectively. I love the event, it's quick, it's fun and has some fun rewards, but having the event at Whitesprings, maybe wasn't the best idea with how that location often lags already.
---
Yourself, because literally no one cares.
---
That's the last one I want/need!
---
cop the agility perk that doesn't trigger traps/mines while crouched.  then lay your own mines at their camp.
---
"Fallout 76. Quilite is our Goal."
---
Oh dang, it is. Thanks!
---
When it is too laggy I just hop up on the balcony above the legendary and face the wall. I figure not even looking at the explosions will reduce the need to render them on my end. Feels like a great event sitting in the corner wearing a dunce cap like this just to avoid crashes.
---
When compared to the other problems, I would agree, the music isn’t a big deal. I do agree with the OP though.
---
I dont get it
---
&gt;Not a waste if it makes people who buy into Bethesdas PREMIUM service think about what they have done.
---
I think about what I did and I'm happy I bought it. Guess what? I will buy it next month and probly the next few months after that.
---
 Only "thick" people I see around here are the ones making these dumb-ass posts.
---
It's not the best choice, it's Bethesda's choice!
---
I've crashed during 3 events in a row now.
---
Yeah so dish out another 100 bucks so you can be a premium crasher!!
---
Agreed
---
Not gonna even read the post after seeing the title. It's a workshop, you're warned beforehand that you are opening yourself up to PVP. If you don't want to deal with PVP, either don't take a workshop or just don't stay there the whole time. And if you're there, just crouch so you don't appear on the map
---
Patience, cave cricket.
---
Everything is a problem these days. I do agree the old music was better but I’m not actually on the screen that long anyway.
---
No g-sync, and I use the nvidia frame rate counter. Ultra runs 60 locked with very few very short dips. Medium is almost never locked, and dips bad.
---
It runs smooth as glass in a private server actually.
---
It's mainly xbonex that are crashing. Something like 50%  crash chance for them.
---
Got ya! I'm thinking about doing multiple small blueprints and piecing it back together that way. It's currently 3 levels, so I can (hopefully) just snap them together via the stairs. As long as I can get the foundations placed exactly the same around the Extractor first, it'll be easy from there.
---
Quit being a trick ass mark and maybe they'll lay off rich boy.
---
It's a valid fear no one can be that happy and not be sinister you will thank me later in life !
---
Don't bother legendary hunting yet - anything you get that you can use now, you won't want to use within another day of playing because you're leveling up too fast early on.  Weapons have a required level, that goes up in jumps of five at a time, until a max weapon level of 50 (many weapon types have a max of 45).  Once you're at 50, you'll be getting the same value from a weapon from that point onward (depending on your card loadout of course) so that's when you want to start caring about legendaries.
---
Hope this makes sense - just grind out levels until 50, then worry about a more permanent build.
---
And by the way. You can buy it by the month. I don't know why everyone is so fucking hung up on the $100 price tag. Jesus christ.
---
No it isn't an advantage. I literally lose nothing and gain nothing from having it. 
---
But why don't you list the specific weight reduction perks and why they are rendered irrelevant.
---
In Addition, every player gets a big fat warning box punched into their faces xD before taking a workshop so...
---
Que?
---
true.. why would you wanna discus a great game on a shitty ass games reddit pag? ohh, to meme
---
..good for a chuckle :)
---
I paid $30 for the game, put in my hours, made it past level 100, did a solo silo and killed a queen. It all felt fun and worth it.
---
There's no more content, so I'm no longer playing. I have other games. The Outer World's is a blast.
---
But I still browse this sub for the entertainment value. It's kinda like a DLC that keeps getting updated ;)
---
So people who spend 60 need to wait around endlessly still for the game to work huh? The people who's dish the money can actually play? Sounds Pretty fucking awful
---
What am I supposed to be looking at??
---
Your ideas are intriguing to me, and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter.
---
Buy it again for Todd.
---
It's an issue with people playing on xbonex they are crashing nearly 50% of the time.
---
If i can add context, last night I kept encountering a bug where I would "fall through" the ground and die when ever i stepped on a foot path.
---
You gain access to your stash from virtually ANYWHERE. Weight reduction perks are mostly rendered useless because you are never more than a few steps from your stash, so there is very little downside to loading up on everything that isnt bolted down.
---
How is that not an advantage?
---
I played consistently up until recently. I love the lore of fallout, but I've never actually enjoyed this game so much as put up with it. The events are always bugged. Real content delayed again. My biggest complaint today is the same I had a year ago, it's clunky. It's so poorly done that I get a headache if I spend more than an hour in game. The other game I play most often is rdr2.... and opening 76 after playing rdr2 is like going back in time 15 of gaming tech.
---
Xbox?
---
That's your opinion. My opinion is YOU'RE pretty fucking awful.
---
I cant your inability to get poked fun at and not get pissy is making my day.
---
You do know that that claim was already proven wrong and is now even marked as incorrect by the sub's moderators?
---
The console having the issue is the Xbox 1x the literal most powerful console currently on the market.
---
I've run it about 10 times on Xbox One with no crashes.
---
Yeah and that's over 100 for the year, 150 something ya whack job. Don't defend. It's a shitty move and shitty people like you defending it is why the companies get away with doing this in the first place. Be part of the solution kid, not the problem.
---
Back in my day I blew up cars barefoot while walking to school both ways up a hill!
---
thats how it is now. people are pathetic af.
---
Nope. I'm running it on an OneX in the living room and a OG One in the back room (son is visiting), no crashes so far at all.
---
Maybe it's too subtle.
---
No issues here.
---
I think you got the wrong pic? Otherwise I don't understand
---
Yes be happy, Todd has happiness if you have coin.
---
Hasn’t crashed once for me on PC. Sorry it’s been crashing on you, that sucks. I actually love this event. Way more fun than Meat Week and I think the rewards are cool. Just missing that Pirate Costume!
---
Are you on PC or console?
---
I've crashed zero times on PC but the end boss has spawned in dead a few times (probably lag).
---
I think its "low power" and he shuts down :)
---
&gt;  Then again I've never experienced much of the long standing bugs people seem to report all the time.
---
That's been my experience with FO76 from the start.
---
Some people get frequent crashes/disconnects, some don't.  Both groups have difficulty believing the experience of the others.  Leads to conflict sometimes.
---
4-5 events and one crash on xbox1.   I also don’t remember crashing before this believe it or not so new for me
---
Ps4
---
Nope, that was the only one omitted.
---
You're lucky then, if you check the other posts about these crashes they are almost all running xbonex. Wondering if it is has something to do with firmware or old installations of fo76 having lingering files.
---
Point number 1: The game is 18+ there should not be any children playing it. I understand bullying is a terrible thing but there is a reason the game is rated 18+ he is clearly not emotionally ready to be playing in such an environment that is at times hostile.
---
Point number 2: The workshop zones are a pvp zone if you claim a workshop you agree to its terms you agree to be attacked it's not a stupid arguement to agree with this prospect. There are some that take advantage of this and do go overboard but still you take a workshop you accept the responsibility.
---
 
---
Point number 3: I applaud your service in assisting that kid very noble thing to do but its not  bethesda at fault here its the parents who allow their child who is clearly underage and should not be playing the game in the first place. There are some things that could be added to the pvp workshop element to assist but to blame the situation entirely on bethesda is ludicrous.
---
No, youra tool.
---
They messed up this clearance tag and didn't care enough to fix it.
---
For the pumpkins at least, it's probably because of the daily quest. They don't want you farming a bunch of pumpkins at your house to just turn them in. Of course, it's pretty silly, considering there are enough pumpkins behind the pumpkin house with green thumbs to complete the quest, but that's likely the rationale.
---
shit, I *had* a 4770k. shits almost 6 years old now. But last week, got a Ryzen 7 3800X now. Man, it made a BIG ass difference on Fallout 76. I went from 50-60 frames to 80-110 frames. The only time ive seen slow downs is when i did the halloween event with like a shit load of other people there where it dropped down to the 30s.
---
It’s probably cause there playing on console
---
I see, you are one of those delusional people that think BGS has anything to do with the way they handle marketing.
---
Just tag  Nate on twitter- he responds pretty regularly throughout the day. He is the lead artist for Fallout 76 as well as the last 5? BGS games.

You went full carebear.  Never go full carebear.
---
It's better for these to be easy, Would you want insanely difficult limited time events? Grinding those would be a nightmare.
---
It must have something to do when the PS4 was made. I know some people with PS4 who haven't crashed at all and then there are a lot I know that crash 50% of the time. 
---
I read once that they changed the internal guts of the ps4 through its life. I thought the article I read that in said older ones actually have better performing hardware. 
---
No idea how true this is though.
---

---
Comedy 100
---
How is adding a sub a shitty move? So you expect them to add content forever for free?
---
I agree with all you said, except isnt weapon steps (and armor) in 10 level increments?
---
I'm on xbox, done it at least 20 times and haven't crashed yet
---
There have been comments that the OneX uses the MS Enhanced graphics on Fallout 76 *if your TV supports it*. And some people have stated setting their OneX to 1080 or 720 reduces their lag and crashing. But since I have it hooked up to an old Roku TV I am only running at 1080 anyway.
---
I've had the same one for 7 years. Never replaced anything so you could be on to something there
---
It seems the chronic crashing is more console based than PC. Hardware limitations I would guess?
---
I've been eyeballing ryzen3, but I have a vive, and ryzen 2 had issues, so I've been hesitant.
---
Tricentennial owner here and yeah, that would be cool but I get the feeling they’re viewing us early supporters as a closed transaction.
---
Doesnt he wear purple?
---
Same here. I accidentally sent someone a team invite that they accepted one time, and did the event 2 times. My game froze up both times.. but  it remembered that I was on a team after ibrestarted! so twice I was able to rejoin and actually finish the event twice! 😁
---
Yeah, yours is an older one. Mine is newer because my original one died.
---
Is this a special type of toilet paper that's rare?
---
Same, laggy and a pause here and there but no crashes on PS4.  I've done the event around ten times.  Personally, I like the rewards but I like Halloween deco.  Got the jack o lantern suit and am pleased with that!
---
Havent had a single crash on ps4?
---
Can’t we already do this?
---
You'll get it!  Still need the lirate hat, short suit, and witch outfit then i might have it all soon!  Hope you get yours soon!

That's no good

Ah, a fellow tricentennial owner ✊

This is awesome I love feeing fallout locations in real life. I got to go to DC a few years back and see things there. Next is Vegas!

Lol .. 20 minutes:-/
---
No... for me its rare... caz i cant effort to find one by myself. ☝️🧐
---
its just so hard to believe that, Im on xbox and havent had a crash in 20 runs..
---
That will be where I'll keep my power armour :)
---
what's up with all the posts about talking points from last year?
---
Now?
---
1-Never
---
6-  Meh, they are okay
---
Then:
---
1-10
---
6- 3 I really hate them at first
---
I'd run them again if we were able to roll unyielding on the Scout Armors, but without having Uny, there is literally no point to the raid.
---
Why do you care about a game you don't play? Maybe stop listening to the YouTube incel mafia who've had a hate boner for this game since day one (for the clickbait) and try it for yourself. It's amazing.
---
I will polietly disagree with you but you are entitle to your preferences.  My man is a sexy beast in this suit.
---
Two weeks ago I would expect some interesting freebies and maybe a thank-you free cosmetics for day -1-buyers. Now? I expect a collection of anniversary-themed skins for 1500 Atoms and little-to-no free items. Yes, I've grown cynical when it comes to Bethesda and their monetisation.
---
On the other hand, I guess that most of the people there are not onboard with Fallout 1st so they could try to fight the fire with some possitive PR. Maybe a special article where they focus on what they've managed to implement in the past year (and I can't lie, there are quite a lot of tiny improvements that make the game play so much better) and give a closer look on upcomming content - with several reassurements that the content will be free. They must be aware that they NEED some positive PR...
---
They might not be in charge of marketing but they sure don't say anything about it. Guess camp guards at certain WW2 holding facilities had nothing to do with what actually went on there too.
---
Yeah, I would like more difficult event. Looks like it's just me, though.
---
Btw, gotta ask, how did you get the mothman label on here?
---
There is always an enemy boss*
---
Fixed it for you.  Can even be just a crowned enemy, doesn't even have to be a legendary.
---
Pretty sure this has been a bug in the unreal engine since 3.
---
Todd "It Just Works" Howard
---
It's called dlc kid. I'm not one that won't spend nothing on a good game. But a game that has continuously been broken for the last year? A game where modding and private world's were promised from the start and now are more expensive then the broken game itself? Not to mention the pr nightmare this game has been. Charge a couple bucks for it man, not 100 bucks. Don't act like this game hasn't been a dumpster fire from the start.
---
Crashes on my Xbox at least half the time
---
Yeah rdr2 is my favourite game so I can imagine. I love the universe of fallout a lot too but its potential is wasted. New vegas is the only game I find to be exceptionally good
---
Gunna? Its already driven me insane xD
---
And don't act ignorant bro. Your asking me how it's a bad move like 80 percent of the player base isn't pissed off at this. Piss off.
---
Don't worry bro, you have from the 3rd to the 12th to get the 14,000 xp
---
That is true. Thank you for the correction.
---
I lost hope when they announced the first kits
---
Not guaranteed legendaries.  I have gotten crowned bosses instead for all 4.
---
It has a monthly sub fee like most games.
---
I have a PS4 Pro and I'm crashing a lot. If it wasn't for the awesome outfits and plans I wouldn't even do it all honestly. Because the 1* Suppressors Pipe Wrench definitely isn't worth it. Lol
---
That seriously made me laugh out loud. So many subs are just dumpster fires. I like my nice little bubble of /all. There are very few others that I have committed to following everything posted. I think I've subbed to like 10 outside of the fallout subs.
---
How long did it take you to come up with this cringe?
---
I deleted it when the pass came out and ruined it for me. So I did play ya twat. You have no idea what you're saying. I have 2 level 139 something's and a 87
---
It's never a wise business decision to call out your parent company for wrongdoings.  As far as I'm concerned premium 1st membership was a success so really they didn't do anything wrong.
---
I cannot believe You even hinted that this was anything like the holocaust of World War II.
---
 I'd stop talking now if I were you.
---
I have PS4 and my husband is on PS4 Pro.  He's always crashed more than I have, since launch.  There's been tremendous improvement in stability compared to launch, but he does still crash more.  We haven't been able to complete Vault 94 yet because of it.
---
I do agree that updates would be better at 2am
---
that is 10-level-increments, just that some cap out at 45 and not 50 :-)
---
Bingo
---
I have more than once fast traveled the entire span of the map to get a forest treasure map and a few bullets.  Sucks lol
---
I didn't realize it was that long - thank you
---
At this point can you blame them for not answering all the haters and shills from other studios? If Bethesda gave these people the world, they would complain and ask for the universe. At a certain point when people are impossible to please, what else can you do? This subreddit is only a small amount of the player base.. it’s best to let them throw their tantrums until they tire themselves out.
---
I'm on PC, unfortunately!
---
*ubisoft would like to know your location*
---
You too! Good luck!
---
its not even noon yet (they normally come out around 11-12EST or a little later)
---
Option 4.... must be ;)
---
I hate to be that guy, but if someone paid money for a subscription, shouldn't they be able to use it?
---
I understand that they should answer everyone equally, but that's not how business works. They want more subscribers, so those people will be their priority
---
Personally, I'm currently playing all three (add Outer Worlds in there) and i'm enjoying them all.
---
I've been talking to a few other Xbox console players and it looks to be limited to the older/original Xbox ones. My friend's who have new Xbox ones get some lag but that's about it.
---
but "every reputable company in the world"?  weird how eso,wow,dnd,etc. all do the same thing.
---
I stopped hoping right after annoucing fallout 1st and seing that people want to pay for that crap. Now im just looking for every even smaller drama around this game. If i see a lot good about this game maybe i start get hopes again.
---
It was just like the cost and you know exactly how much.
---
5/10 ign bruh. 52 percent metacritic. The game is far from amazing.
---
Bethesda please ban hackers like Noobmaster3000. This mode could be so good!
---
It’s been consistent for 11am EST, i read them every week on my way to lecture
---
I said I was being conservative but I'm also not great at BR so yeah a bad match will have me there lol.
---
I’m still highly interested in getting the Outer Worlds. It’s on my list along with Pokémon Sw/Sh to play with my kids
---
If you want I can make a post complaining about the buggy Halloween event, im a FO F\*\*ed 1st member. They might respond me :D
---
It hasn’t
---
Xbox and at least 10 times with zero crashes. Does get lag but that’s about it.
---
Well, you see, the initial purchase of the game is not good enough to entitle you to support. You'll have to download the patch, wait a month for the install. Then you have to draw a pentagram on the floor, place a copy of new Vegas in the center. Invoke the name of Todd Howard. Remove the vowels. Chant it while burning 20 dollar bills. If you're doing everything right, customer support will be with you as soon as you spend an extra 13 dollars every month.
---
No crashes here
---
I thought it was a well known fact at this point that only a black man make an orange suit look cool. Your character looks like a metrosexual hipster - not that there’s anything wrong with that!
---
no, but you are a week late to the karma hate train.
---
If you don't attack the robots for the first couple mins while your lighting the bonfires then they won't attack unless they get hit from one of the cars exploding.
---
Agreed. I don't like this. Why was it changed?
---
Yeah like cod and destiny and Halo and fallout 3, nv, 4 and 2k and Madden and gears and oooh, wait..
---
Its frustrated me some too. I've crashed out of probably 30% of the events. But Being as how I have about 4 hours a night somenights and the event is every hour its a real bummer to drop.  
---
I really am enjoying the event though. I'm not really into collecting outfits but am really enjoying it this week for some reason.
---
If there was other stuff built there left over.. but just missing paintings doesn't seem like sign that a person was there. Unless it was a Jag driver.
---
It's even better than ever for me, but I haven't rage-hated it like you and so many others, so my perspective probably won't change your mind.
---
Yeah i did the quest 3 times total and got cheesy rewards and 1 time i did it solo drowing like a good 500 50cal rounds
---
I’ve crashed at 50% of the Halloween events I’ve participated in. On Xbox One I just end up staring at the ground when the Event gets laggy and that seems to save me from a crash most of the time. 
---
All of Whitesprings is now a lag zone for me. I’ve crashed just running and jumping around the the place since this latest update.
---
Seasonal ladders have caused too much toxicity in other games for me to trust it. Too heavily monetized and too under designed, and it fermented awful communities. But I agree on most of these ideas.
---
Fair point - not saying I like it but I get that.
---
I would say it's better. Servers are more stable (still not enough imo), some bugs were fixed, and they added a few quests. It's still not a good game when it comes to technical stuff, but it's playable and enjoyable for me.
---
In before Bethesda announces a new feature for First Members - for a mere $12.99 a month, your game will only crash 25% of the time!
---
Booooooooooooooooo
---
I want to believe you but I just don’t see how that’s possible. Even my pals with fresh One Xs have significant lag in this event.
---
I haven't seen a single one of these "quitters" actually do that though.  If I were to stop playing I would def try to recoup some of the money spent.  more money for the next game and such.
---
Can you file a ticket for that for me, please? If you can recall the location on the footpaths that would help as well.  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Yeah thats where I'm at now. Just waiting till the final release day then I'll start again.
---
Do you play often?
---
Kids need to learn to understand the written words and the consequences of their actions. It's called growing up.
---
It's crashed my XB1 to the start menu; 5/5 times at this point.
---
Thank you for telling me, I'll raise that as well!
---
Same, done like 30.
---
Which is a problem, because if it was at least consistent then the fix would be relatively easy to find, yet with a bunch of people crashing and a bunch not, fuck knows what's up.
---
Leader of the Pack, 3 1-stars every time at your level
---
Well done post, completely agree! Take an upvote!
---
ok so some kind of rifle.  I'd avoid bolt action 50 calibers because there is a significant cycle time before you can get the next shot unless you are sure that one shot will do it.  If so, the quad black powder rifles are awesome.  Otherwise an assault, combat, or handmade? Gauss for energy?  Remember that scorched beasts have very high energy resistance so you want to concentrate on ballistic damage, but otherwise it is the effective DPS that matters.  I really like the recon scope to track my opponents, so it also depends on what you can craft.  Fiber Optic bundles are one of the rarest non-nuke zone materials to find.
---
Did the event 5 times yesterday without issues.
---
I've had this bug randomly since day 1 of release.... not sure what causes it but always chopped it up to a bug. I played with a guy a while back that said he had a bug that he'd randomly hear a mine start beeping for a second.  I totally believed him because.... well... look at all the bugs and glitches. A couple weeks later it happened to me.
---
When it does come out it isn't going to kiss this subreddit's ass about its fallout 1st tantrum anyway so....
---
Yeah they did a horrible job of explaining the NW Halloween stuff.
---
I had to have someone explain it to me, so now I tell others, it's until the 12th
---
Nah, to really pull of a orange suit you have to be a 73 year old fat white guy.  We should be getting a demonstration of that in a year or so.
---
It's so fun.  Borderlands is training me on fps, I'm coming from a long history of turn based RPGs going back to the early Final Fantasy games.  The Fallout series eased me into it and Boderlands is my advanced training, lol.  I find accuracy is easier in Outer Worlds so that probably means it's an easier game.  But the story is immersive and I'm loving it.
---
They will probably reward you. If you pay them enough
---
It seems to be hit and miss for people. I just know I am on the miss side.
---
If it doesn't come out it's just a sign that we need to put more wood on the fire until they take notice.
---
Honestly great read and very true.
---
As far as stimpaks go, you should get the Pharma farma perk in your Luck skill. It gives you more of a chance to find more aid in first aid boxes.
---
Soon we'll all pay with more than just money. And the people that subscribe will thrive.
---
I didn’t know that, as FO76 is almost all of what I’ve played recently.  My experience is more from the corporate world supporting enterprise apps, but just because all game studios release in the middle of the day doesn’t mean they should.  IMO.  Also, I’d be pretty ticked if I were spending $13/mo and 3-6 hours a day 1-2 times a  month were completely down.  End of the world, no.  But if people are paying a premium, may not be unreasonable to be upset at that.
---
And they learned that lesson. No one pays for unstable bullshit, so if Zeni was running this shit, they would prioritize both stability, and bug fixes before really anything. I actually WANT them to take over running the game, because they don't lie about their gameplan. If they plan to add shit to the shop, they won't pretend otherwise, and private servers would be both PRIVATE, and SERVERS instead of the joke Bethesda released. The Atom shop would be VERY different.
---
Busy segregating the rest of us with fallout 1st
---
The clocks changed last week in some locations, but not yet in the US.
---
You can trigger them on private servers, several times untill 30 min after. Dont know what the trigger is seems to trigger better when solo
---
It's there, just not ALL the time
---
I really only had a chance to do 4 so far and it’s only crashed once, on my first run. It crashed all the time on me during the meat week events though and it crashes all the time for me during Uranian fever.
---
If you run into a douche, just swap worlds. It's that easy.
---
I doubt the subscription makes as many people leave as some think, what really does is the lack of new content for a long time. We will see if Wastelanders manages to reverse the trend.
---
You are gonna pay besthedia regardless, so why give you anything for the money? You are already the perfect mark.
---
Straight up! I really want to enjoy it fully. Crashes are stressing me out.
---
yep. my dream is for the franchise to get sold off to another developer that could actually do it justice. but that'll never happen.
---
I did it twice last night. No crashes on ps4 but got didilly squat for rewards. I got a golf skirt.
---
I always just pretend it's a stray bullet from some far off fight. Never know, some bullets travel very far if they miss their target.
---
I’m doing something that triggers them. During lightning the fires in the park they will attack. I must be hitting them somehow.
---
Great, thanks!
---
The psycho recipe was pretty common during Meat Week. See if you can just get the recipe from someone
---
I don't think it's crashed on my PS4 once. Yes I want a cookie.
---
I hope so, also been playing since beta and pre-ordered because I believed in the game. To this day I still play. It would be nice if they considered doing something for players who stuck through all the issues and price changes. I won't hold my breath though.
---
Look in every mirror. I can usually walk out with a handful of chems just from running white springs.  There is a perk card that helps to find more chems also.
---
“Pete has wares, *if vault dweller has coin*”
---
I read it online. Don’t know where I’d get the goo from.
---
I just wanna do the syringer mod quest dammit!
---
I bet you we will see some fo1st exclusive areas in the future. Everyone said there's no way they'd do a lot of things, and they've done all of the.
---
Game crashes, game freezes, game disconnects....shall I go on? Lol
---
Spoken like a true incel . I applaud you , diarrhea person.
---
May have been level.  I didn't see any griefing until rolling a new char.  It tapered off and finally stopped by time I hit around level 30.  Granted that was back in early summer.so may have changed.
---
You're attacking everyone who is enjoying the game and saying that they are nothing more than a corporate drone.
---
Those few times I've played this event, the legendary has been killed before I even noticed it has spawned.
---
" **the silence is deafening** "
---
You should try to be a little more dramatic.
---
I have had thos thought too
---
Just taking notes from youtubers
---
If you're on ps4 I'll give you 100 stimpaks
---
Make sure they are actually firing on you, because they will still attack the ghouls or anything else they see as a threat. They may have got hit by an explosion or another player may have attacked one.
---
How to monetize it?
---
I’ve been stubbing my toe since the beta.
---
Is it weird i wanna play this game just because of how big a clusterfuck it is?
---
Are you on a console or PC?  I am on PC and while I have seen random client crashes from time to time I have not seen it during the event. However, there is tons of lag from the explosions.
---
seems like everybody gets 1 and 2. Invisible sniper ? actually yes. I've taken hits from this. single hits and near misses, visible rounds hitting the ground around me. Hide behind tree, till I can get a direction - has to be above on the cliff - move up tight to the cliff face - eh, not possible, I'm still taking fire - from inside the cliff ???????. one of 4 instances.
---
Ah, that is probably the difference causing some major issues and others none.
---
If all we get is a damn icon, I swear to god... 
---
I think what would be more annoying for me, is if they offered something free that people already owned. Initially I was going to write that “I” owned, but I can’t imagine it happening to anyone, I would be beyond angry. 
---
Even if they just gave us like 5000 caps lmao.
---
From the gameplay I've seen it seems kind of dull, more 'The Talking Heads' than 'The Outer Worlds'. But I suppose it's different if you're playing it and not just watching as a bystander. I'll wait for a price drop though.
---
So you don't actually play 76, but you're here to call people that say positive things about the game "PR accounts."
---
You say that and I agree, no way the hit mess that is 76 is related to Outer Worlds. Though New Vegas just might be...
---
#🎇🎃👻
---
LIke?
---
Crashed for me 3 out of the 4 times I tried it
---
Awesome thanks.
---
Hate to be that guy but if it comes today it will be a big fluff piece full of vague teases.
---
Someone else explained it why some xbonex are having issues and others aren't. Here is their explanation:
---
&gt;There have been comments that the OneX uses the MS Enhanced graphics on Fallout 76 if your TV supports it. And some people have stated setting their OneX to 1080 or 720 reduces their lag and crashing.
---
you would think so...
---
Completed the event 11 times now. The only crashes I've ever had is when I try to server hop after my server crushes the event in 7 minutes and I try to double up like was suggested that I do on YouTube. I tried 3 times, crashed every time. 
---
I play on Xbox One S, not even the fancy one.
---
I think it would be too much orange, with the face and all.
---
Are you mad that it's text post only? Because I'm pretty it was done intentionally to keep the sub from divulging into the crap most subs are of "Here's my character", "here's some fan art I TOTALLY did", "Here's a meme that loosly relates to the topic"
---
will we get a free thing? probably. is it going to be good? idunno. will it be exclusive to people who have been playing since day 1? definitely not.
---
Trekking around the hills of WV with 400# of crap is tiring, you're feet get too heavy to pick up and you stub your toe!
---
Best answer I got for ya
---
That's a discussion for /r/fnv then
---
No shit?? Absolutely man, my PSN name is MrZika.
---
yeah
---
I doubt Bethesda is one of those companies.
---
I'll stand with you. Two against the Wasteland!
---
11 completions on Xbox, no crashes due to the event or lag... but crashes when trying to server hop at the end of the event to cheese some more rewards from another server that did theirs slower than mine.
---
The xp gain from perks is decent.
---
Try train stations for purchase or go to other camps vending machine
---
They are still super light on the weapon skins, id think that would be one of the more purchased items
---
Very strict rules for sure.
---
Thanks. I’ll pay attention.
---
A lot of settings seem to get changed every time there is an update, it can get annoying specially when it's something like Pacifist mode being turned off without your knowledge.
---
I was super surprised last night when I got a Whitespring jumpsuit. Currently rocking the pirate costume.
---
Rough go of things. Thanks.
---
I wouldn't really call that a problem though. 
---
The only problem I've had was a little bit of lag. It took a bit to register lighting the bonfires, putting graffiti on the walls, and the sentry bot loaded in very slowly on one run, but the rest were pretty smooth, especially in the private worlds.
---
Same here. Normally the event would still be going on as soon as I reconnected. I left the world and jumped into a new one after a couple quick runs and was able to double the event twice. I got the JackOLantern pant suit last night doing that.
---
If only.
---
Bethesda: “we’re pushing wastelanders back so we don’t release something that breaks the game like everything else we’ve added”
---
Also Bethesda: “here’s an event that auto-crashes the server 80% of the time”
---
So, what do you plan to do with this data?
---
Console. I think it is more prevalent there
---
Lol what you get for playing fo76
---
The brotherhood of steel mission where you have to go to the glass caverns is like this also. One sitting for the entire mission and no deaths or you will have to restart from the beginning.
---
Seems lots of people never do them.
---
And your tv is newer and supports Xbox ms enhanced gfx?
---
There have been comments that the OneX uses the MS Enhanced graphics on Fallout 76 if your TV supports it. And some people have stated setting their OneX to 1080 or 720 reduces their lag and crashing.
---
As i run with T51b nuka cola with the pipboy helmet as my PA set, i endorse this message :)  
---
That said i've been lucky that no one's nuked any of the events i've been in
---
Yeah good points for sure. My cheating wife left me because of it .. lol I can laugh about it now as I got my life back in order, so I am more sensitive to it .. I love the game and enjoy playing it and finally have gotten back to playing it more. I had many good times and will continue and don't want to be blackmailed because I was addicted for sure ..  yeah it is just a cash grab ... only advice is make sure you put your family first and don't be stupid like me .. I have a new girl, new house etc and my life is back on track. I now know he dangers and can stop at any point and appreciate life more now.
---
Let's just all hope they don't make another online FO game. Co-op sure, or like minecraft with the option to go online. Either of those would have been awesome and probably more stable and less broken. But who knows, we'll all pay one way or another.
---
Thank you so much for the advice man. However, I'm gonna do my best not to rush through things too quickly if I can avoid it. I'm trying to level in tandem with my friend as much as possible.
---
Only Destiny is similar. It's more like WoW and ESO.
---
Because its server based instances, not locally hosted.  They would need to change the architecture to do so, would undermine cash shop as well so not likely to happen.
---
On XB1 - 20 events so far, 20 rewards
---
0 Mischief night crashes to dashboard
---
3 mischief night permanent freezes - once from final boss exploding - twice from the cars near the first checkpoint bonfire exploding (if your game freezes near the end and you can still hear audio, stay logged in until rewards are given out and you will get them)
---
2 Nuclear Winter Crashes while being placed in lobby
---
I have found logging out, then back in to a fresh server right before the event starts helps keep you from freezing.  Every time I have frozen, I was playing for an extended time before joining the event.
---
I honestly hope it’s for everyone, I’m just trying to put out the bare minimum because I know suggestions like these are barely considered as is, so if I start with a little, and someone does somehow respond, we have something to work with. I just hope it’s something worthwhile honestly.
---
I assure you it's real, it's just that targets are few and far in between. Either not that many subscribing scum or they aren't showing it off much.
---
Awesome, thank you for the suggestion man.
---
Mind if I add you too? I have a few legendaries that will help getting to lvl 50 a bit easier
---
I’ll do some averages and post the results. I just want to add to the conversation with data rather than opinion.
---
No, sorry, it was not me--and it did happen.  But, believe what you want, if it helps you feel better.
---
“But I think we still have to go on the trip”
---
Indeed.
---
I think the sad part is, in order to make as much new content as they are, they need to pay alot of people to do it. this could potentially mean that if they actually stuck to that statement, they might not create new content at all. id rather pay a bit for new content then have the game stagnate just to uphold that quote.. they are kinda between a rock and a hard place, even if they put themselves there
---
Did you enjoy them or just grind for the plans.
---
They propbably made it text only to stop the massive "HERE'S MY FALLOUT CHARACTER" posts
---
u/Chubbypachyderm  , u/lausee and all you others.
---
The fact that the Lvl 167 didn't PvP the OP is a clear indication that all they were interested in was shitting on the new player, clear bullying.
---
But that's not the explicit purpose of workshops.  The purpose of workshops is in the name.  They just also have this secondary (conflicting) use that MAY happen.  The wording doesn't say: By claiming this workshop you will get ganked by a douche who is 100+ levels above you because they have a small ego and need to feel better about themselves.
---
Do you play it?
---
I pretend I twisted an ankle.
---
&gt;I'm way too tired of coming to this subreddit after Bethesda has done it again and everyone is mad 
---
I'm tired of this "everyone is mad shit" - no, not EVERYONE is mad.  Since the day the last patch was released there were people on both sides.  It reached a climax when you had various youtubers making their videos - and the non-players came to troll... they left since there's new news about other companies.  
---
Believe it or not, some people are fine with the game such as myself. Go back to some posts I made 9 months ago when I had server issues.  Those have been resolved.  I don't have any issues any longer.
---
Doesn't matter when it would have come out.
---
There would still be a shitstorm of people bitching about it.
---
We enjoyed the first one and three only .
---
YES. I loved the first theme!
---
That emote is pretty cute :)
---
I played for 5 hours first day it was out with zero crashes
---
🤔
---
I really enjoy 76 and have even given a little hard cash to the Atom store, but I would resent any kind of enforced subscription just to be able to play the basic game.
---
Online bullying... Jesus Christ...
---
You are still not mentioning the specific weight reduction perks and why.
---
Dirt cheap? Overpriced lies is more accurate.
---
Thanks for letting us know. I'll make a note.
---
&gt; -2020.02 free-to-play
---
Very doubtful, at most it could happen after (and if) Wasterlanders flops, but why just before releasing an expansion that could sell some more copies of the game? But I think it is more likely the game will be made only temporarily free at the launch of Wastelanders, like for a weekend, enough for anyone to try it for free, but still have to pay to see the entire content.
---
&gt; -2020.04 wastelanders arrives and flops
---
Hard to predict that, the expansion may or may not be good, although I would not be too surprised if it was negatively received regardless.
---
&gt; 2020.06 Starfield will be announced to release end of 2020
---
Doubtful only 2 years after FO76, my bet would be on 2021 at the earliest, and probably no release on the current generation consoles.
---
Nice!!
---
That was the original intention, but Wastelanders got delayed and the topcats told them to go ahead and launch F1st anyways since it had already been ready for some time.
---
Well, believe what you want. I can't prove anything and neither can you. I just find it hilarious that you would instantly dismiss it as "tin foil hat theories".
---
Cambridge Analytica recently used Facebook to influence and/or potentially rig a US presidential election. Yet you find the idea of a video game company using forums and social media in 2019 to post positive comments about their own game to be on the level of UFO conspiracies.
---
Yea got the candy bucket last night, and you can set it for Death, or Dropped, or both.  Thanks for letting me know - been dropping lots of small things all over the event and love seeing players rush to the candy bucket for a full size golf club I shoved in there.
---
Cool thanks.
---
Yep, thus why passives, like me, avoid workshops despite that some quests want you to take a workshop.
---
*How’s that Bethesda launcher working for ya*
---
Nothing is gonna get done before it's over.
---
The new film dude, Joaquin is doing a great job.
---
I buy a skin or some items once a month to support the game cause I love it. And the pass  gives you atoms PLUS all this other stuff. Sorry you quit the game but I don't see how this pass 'ruined' it for you.
---
Wow, aren't you a ray of sunshine. Who hurt you?
---
It seems like most of the reports of crashing are console. Primarily Xbox. Must be a hardware thing or something in that specific fork of the game
---
tbh i feel limiting something to only day 1 players to be more work for them because i seriously doubt they bothered to keep track of how early people started playing. so giving it to everyone if they log in and redeem it from the shop would probably be the "bare minimum" for them.
---
My guild has been doing it on private servers and its been a blast. Little bit of lag here and there but not bad. Also if you finish fast enough you can hop to a second private server and get a second event in each hour!
---
Let's not forget that with the removal of Survival mode, Nuclear Winter, the workshops, and camp/player raids are the only PVP sources out there now.
---
Not tried it on private yet, might give that a go tonight!
---
Tried 2 train stations they didn’t have it
---
is there even going to be one?
---
That's right, good catch, I vaguely remember that one, I have only done it a few times ..
---
You know whats cool? Doing the event quickly and then server hopping to complete it again.
---
even that suit is more of a red. only his vest is orange.
---
I can't imagine young people going to the arcades and being beaten by someone at Street Fighter 2. What a soft mess...
---
Like what. Things they've done they said they wouldn't? Or are you asking me to speculate on content that they may not have created yet?
---
Yes, That is the point of workshops.  A contested area of the map where instead of facing off with enemies and going out scavinging supplies, you instead can get a source of supplies being fed to you (for free usually, since the workshop has supplies you can use) but the danger comes from players.  
---
If you take a workshop and no one bothers you, great, but it's designed to encourage the PVP.  The fact people don't always engage in PVP for it does not change what it's role was intended to be.
---
Stairs are special, try connect another stair so you can remove the other one just to place down the stuff close to it. Placing stuff on rug also work then move the rug
---
That's what it looks like. I'm on PS4 and am having a hell of a time with frequent crashes.
---
Bethesda 🤗🤗🤗
---
Yeah, there was a good group of people doing them at first, but a lot were just going for the power armor, and once you get it ... there isn't much incentive to keep doing it, esp since its crashes people. 
---
So a combo of that, and the rest of us non-PA plebs finding out about the Uny thing is a recipe for everyone to stop raiding.
---
i got the short suit one and i am so upset because i wanted the pantsuit. i don't wanna show my knees and elbows to people! i have standards!
---
Cheaters in any PC game is inevitable, you can't get rid of all of them.
---
I assume so.     
---
Because there's people with enough time on their hands to check stuff like that.
---
I'm curious as well.
---
the way they priced it....it'd be hard for them not to see it as profitable. only their most loyal base will sign up for the 100 bucks. but i imagine the one month even did pretty well for them. it is futile in that is just bethesda's model now. nevermind how much you may have paid in the past. everything going forward is going to cost money.
---
go see  JuiceHead's latest video, he has a lot of cool info in it :)
---
Not just those, the coffins, and the pyres and the table with the pentacle on it and every single other cool thing they added to the whitespring including the corpses.  Instead I get a friggen vase I'm just going to accidentally scrap cause it's not an actual placable object. Tf?
---
Yes but in fallout 4 there’s exploits for all this stuff rug glitch,pillar glitch,invisible wires etc. Not letting us exploit the game and putting more restrictions made the building inconsistent and frustrating.
---
Bethesda has already addressed this issue. Just get Fallout 1st and your lag and dc will be fixed.
---
I saw it
---
It's literally the easiest quest in the game, and the rewards are pretty lame grenades. Seems silly to hold back based on that, instead of reworking the quest.
---
Think it has to do with the location. Iirc they did a patch in dec or jan where they did something (reduce amount of robots??) to reduce the server instability.
---
Now they added a big ol event that has e1 show up creating more instability.
---
Yeah you doubt. They probably only advertise their games in the local newspaper, amirite?
---
If it helps I was crashing a lot on the porches of the cottages, especially the section where the porch steps change in elevation, or in the courtyard at the boss phase of the event.
---
Yeah, and Nuclear Winter (which can be fun) is very different than the rest of the game play, and if you aren't a fan Battle Royale, that pretty much leaves you with Workshops and Camp Raids.  Players can pretty easily stay out of Camp Raids...So that leaves Workshops as the only consistent form of PVP.
---
The Fallout player base is used to a single player game with free mods. This isn't that kind of game.
---
Im not mad when ppl one shot mobs unless we're farming legendaries.   Just starred bosses, thats discourteous.
---
Mischeif night gets slighty laggy, rarely moderately laggy for me when things get wild but never causes a dc.  You sure its not on your end?
---
It’s been pretty crashy for me on PS4 also, but seems to get worse during peak time for some reason. I’ve had a few days off so I’ve played all day for two or so days. Managed to do the event a bunch with only a few crashes during the day, but later at night I crash much more. And even when I don’t crash, it’s often laggy enough to make interaction with objects break, so have a hard time trying to light bonfires/spray tags/fork the lawn.
---
Definitely gets worse when people nuke Whitesprings, but half the time those events fail anyway because people are too busy ghoul killing to do the objectives.
---
👳‍♂️
---
Makes sense, thank you!

I've done the event maybe 30 times no issues, it might be a hardware or connections issue.
---
I get the feeling they're reaching the point where the game can't run in a stable manner on minimum spec machines anymore, including some of the lower spec consoles. Hopefully some serious engine optimization is coming with or before wastelanders.
---
This smacks of boomer retardation.  
---
Devs are not CMs, Bethesda's CMs are often talking on the official BethNet forums, a famous fallout youtuber is a fucking Bethesda Community Manager, don't say they don't care about the community when a member of the community has been a community manager for months now. This subreddit is a fanmade forum, and sometimes CMs do come onto here to talk and reply to comments or questions made DIRECTED to them.
---
And I'd be all for it if Workshops had the option to either craft and not PvP, or craft and also allow PvP.
---
If this was allowed, do you think a majority of players would choose the PvP option?
---
The answer to that probably also tells you everything else you need to know about if /both/ players want to PvP.
---
It literally would have been applauded if they didn't put the tent, and stash box along with it. It would have been a cheaper way to get atoms, along with some exclusive outfits and emotes. No one would have batted a damn eye but they had to put things in there that would piss people off. I don't think this company can help itself anymore.
---
That ^^
---
You're telling me. I know that we seem to be on a "Fuck Bethesda" kick right now, so anything that isn't overwhelming criticism seems to get downvoted and equally people who are enjoying the game downvote anything that's to the contrary. 
---
The game has always run fine for me. At launch I had the same problems other users had with enemies in a constant T-pose but that seemed to be fixed pretty early on. Truth be told 76 has consistently ran better for me than Fallout 4 ever did even to this day. 
---
It's hard here especially with everything recently to talk about anything without it turning into an argument and petty name-calling. Whilst I think it would be much better for Bethesda to actually speak to users here about their own problems, I can certainly understand any unwillingness to do so.
---
Oh so it might be connected to the TV? And i'm on a original xbox one but my friend that was crashing a ton is on one so that is probably it. Thanks!
---
Seems like they aren’t releasing one this week, same as last week
---
If you don't ping the CMs, they won't respond to you. Also note that this reddit is a fanmade forum and isn't even half the Bethesda community. The Bethnet forums are offical forums where the CMs are more frequent because people frequently are posting on it.
---
Some of the community managers have been silent for over a month tbh
---
I gave up on raids day 1 so did Bethesda it seems
---
Theres no way of checking that nor how many people are playing the game unfortunately.
---
Junk reduction, chem reduction, etc. Why? Because, as I said before, you can plop dowen your tent virtually anywhere and unload, so being overweight is mostly a non issue.
---
This isnt rocket science...
---
Shows how much you really understand
---
Specially *not* in Halloween.
---
Youre a very sad human being.
---
"smoother"? probably. but not by much. i have the utmost belief in humanity to be angry no matter what happens.
---
Idk what to tell you. It's the truth and I'm obviously an outlier.
---
&gt;"Todd's meaty man meat in your mouth on/on", that sort of thing.
---
So, they'll be allowing mods from that other site? Oh my.
---
10 and 10
---
Pharmacy in Harper's Ferry usually has a couple... Also, one of the early-game churches has a lot of them. Flatwoods or Helvetia, I think... I'll update the comment when I get on later.
---
Oh yea I got that one, usually about twice a play session I hear a mine start going off (but never explode) it always is cut off either mid trigger or just before it would explode
---
Agreed. I have issues placing floors in random tiles that are literslly empty
---
Buggy is one thing, I could deal with buggy if the game was of a good quality that would be fine with me. My problem is the game’s quality itself and the very anti-consumer decision after decision made by bethesda with this game for about a year now. You’re entitled to your opinion I respect that. But to me fallout 1st was the final straw
---
Sounds like this is only a problem for the older Xboxes?
---
You're acting like they're gonna make DLC exclusive when its not. Future items like the ranger outfit skin that got leaked maybe locked behind Fallout First but not DLC or future quest-related content.
---
Same as any other battle pass or Season pass, like destiny 2
---
Anything they’d release today would be wildly inflated. There are tons of people to subbed for one month just to get the Ranger Armor, Atoms and to fill a Scrapbox. The really interesting thing would be to see how many are left after 2-3 months.
---
1) Hop camps for player vending machines
---
2) Buy psycho from machines for a few caps
---
3) ?
---
4) Profit
---
I really want the Pumpkin Combat Armor paint, but I fucking suck at NW. 
---
The entire NW reward system needs a revamp. Kill 5 players before you die? 200xp. Hide in a bush the entire time like a coward? ~1000xp
---
It's not the tv its the Xbox using the enhanced gfx setting. It will only do that if the tv supports it. You can still turn it down to 1080p tonhave it crash less.
---
Of course they wouldn't take the PVP option because then they could hold the workshop forever and produce things like endless supplies of Fusion Cores to sell at their home base.  All the while preventing people from taking that workshop to make the Fusion Cores themselves.  
---
To be honest, I'm starting to think you're entire thread is some form of "gotcha" on Fallout 1st, since you can go in there and take workshops without PVP.
---
It's not 100 bucks! It's a monthly sub, just like WoW has (a game where have to buy the base game, expansions, in-game store, etc.).
---
Except I’m running old tech and it doesn’t crash at all for me
---
Try borderless. This works best with a multiple monitor setup
---
Just got the Jack O Lantern pant suit...it's fucking glorious! :-)
---
They ahve said the perk overhaul stuff was for everyone. It is as much as gameplay advantage as the junkboxes, and you already have portable CAMPs.
---
Do you even know what an incel is? Cause in no way does it apply there haha. Nice try though 👍. Being an asshole  applys though. Besides what do you think furiously tapping your keyboard at me is gonna do? Im Guessing you're one of those folks who thinks yelling at people on Twitter means you accomplished something. Get off your fat ass and go volunteer or donate to charity or get a job where you actually help folks instead of crying at me 😂😂
---
I would suggest that too
---
People would have been more forgiving of all the bugs and problems if the game had more interesting content.
---
thanks for the info
---
Yeah, I was mainly speaking overall that ALL reps went silent, and only started responding again yesterday.
---
She replied to 4 posts. 3 were by fallout 1st members. None of them were fallout 1st related.
---
It crashed each time I did it on the PS4 Pro.
---
You can’t get unyielding in the vault?
---
I get what you’re saying to an extent. My best guess is because they’ve were big fans of Bethesda’s work and with fallout 76, whether you like the game or not, we’ve been lied to. And I can tell you as a big fallout fan this game really did piss me off when it came out, as a fan. And the fallout 1st thing was the last straw to me. But I see what you’re saying it should be more constructive.
---
Bethesda has said the subscription is subject to change when they want it.  
---
They have said Private worlds will evolve.  
---
Yes, I think bethesda can change Fallout first when feedback asks for a change.  
---
However it will not be canceled and the instant respec would be something alotted to everyone.
---
Your argument only makes sense in a world where Workshops are actually battle arenas and don't have any world-building / crafting capability.
---
But, that's not what they are.  So stop fluffing up arguments to try to make it sound like you are right.  Workshops are dual purpose.  I've personally stopped using them for crafting, because of this behavior, and I was trying to explain the same to the other player last night -- don't stick around and actually USE the workshop, just leave after claiming it, because the gameplay behavior is broken.
---
I've played them 3 times. The first two, demolished immediately in the first swarm. Third time completed it with the help of a veteran. It was a fun experience, and not just a 'go here and kill this' type quest, which was great.
---
0 XP though, and complete garbage rewards? Lame.
---
Awesome, what about the experience makes it the best ever for you? What are your favorite mechanics/ elements of the raid?
---
You can walk to WS station, sell the vase, then turn around and pick up more to sell.
---
Have I taken a time machine to 1993?
---
I wonder why they didn't do a halloween opening while the event is up.  Could have used the Atomic store track and a scrolling picture of the updated white springs.
---
Never claimed op was correct. Just that the info was easy to find &amp; that you’re incredulousness at the claim was unreasonable.
---
Solution, make default screen into Atomic Shop thus giving us new music. Can confirm has at least 3 different times music for Atomic Shop has been changed.
---
What games specifically? They are the only reason I still play Diablo 3 or Path of Exile.
---
What can they actually do for the event bugs? Honestly, you people bash on the community managers for it, but there is nothing they can do about it. Login issues, they can help with.
---
I get being mad at Bethesda, but that doesn't mean shit all over people for not doing something outside of their specific jobs. Community managers aren't developers, they ca't fix game problems.
---
How about the holotape games? I've got 2 characters over level 100. 
---
Both of them have only ever found 2 holotape games.
---
Lol I tried like 3 machines and none have psycho..
---
Morgantown - hope
---
Sutton - nope
---
Whitesprings - nope
---
Tried all of them, none had it.
---
First off, who would be compliling all the numbers just so you can have your fucking moment?  
---
Second of all, they aren't going to release a Inside the Vault just to be like "Here's how many Fallout First Members there are."  
---
You're a troll.
---
Hi. I'm on PC and I've learned 3 different pumpkin plans but can only make the basic one.
---
How did they screw "us" over?
---
I joined for the first time in over a week so I could get those cool looking suits, but idek how to do half of the tasks required to pass the event. There isn’t much guidance
---
You're a towel!
---
 Need to be more like actual raids oof. Clear story progression with bosses and stuff that have mechanics.
---
I am one of those people. Comparatively the armor and atoms were worth the cost. Wont be renewing for the next month.
---
Player vending machines my dood.  I see psycho in Players machines for less than 15 caps constantly.  The robots have always been shite for things you actually need.
---
Not terribly surprising given the radio-silence since "1st" was released, but terribly disappointing.
---
Unnecessary and Toxic Post.
---
I shouldn’t have to pay $100 a year to play a full priced game
---
Yes, do you always answer questions with non-sequitors? Because it only highlights your stupidity
---
I've done it a bunch now does get laggy but never crashed for me, in on Pc
---
👍🏻👍🏻
---
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
---
It's like comparing apples to oranges. One is an online mmorpg the other a single player rpg. Naturally they both have their strengths. Personally outer worlds will entertain me for a while but at the end of the day I'll still be logging in to play nuclear winter and kill some scorchbeasts.
---
Only time it crashed for me was when 12 dudes showed up with their TSE gatling plasmas.
---
Careful what you say or you'll be paying for time machines in the atom shop lol
---
Went to whitesprings and got jumped by level 60 ghouls (I’m level 30) and when I tried to run they didn’t stop following me haha.
---
It just isn’t my lucky day on this game..
---
Wha
---
Obviosuly there's lore since Oxhorn records his livestreams of 76 for more lore videos.
---
Nice dude thanks for this! I’ve got no qualms about picking this up now.
---
Inside the vault...Huge pile of money fleeced from ultra loyal fan base...It just works..,For the Todd Howard retirement fund
---
The best mission is dead in the water, second washout kind ok and the worst meltdown, because forced to wear PA or hazmat suit. The raid it self was fun we did all the missions on all difficulties. I liked the mechanics of the first mission, how the strangler heart open up when you get close and not on a timer.
---
Its because no one is special...no matter what parents or Spongebob said.  You are no different than anyone else that paid for the game,  so you have no right to expect others to bow down to your own private personal standards, rules or weaknesses.   This adult game has ADVERTISED PVP elements with options YOU CONTROL to ELIMINATE the PVP altogether. So you see its not Monopoly, Candyland, Jenga or Super Mario.  It is based on nuclear war, mass murder, disease and mutations....not ponies, puppies and lil kitty cats. You grow your character for strength through abilities and perks through leveling.  The goal is to survive the G-D M-F'N Wasteland, build your camp for defense and choose your perk loadout for effectiveness. So its not Bethesda encouraging bullying... it seems to be possibly REAL life that encourages personal weakness, quitting when it gets to hard, giving up trying to get better and instead demand others who have earned their spot, paid their dues and physically grinded to reach their level to STOP playing the game as it was meant to be played and follow your own personal rules.  This is like an OUTRAGE fetishist protesting a school and contacting TV news stations for media coverage because the final exam is "too hard" for them to pass...when every other person who took the test passed, most after working hard and studying.
---
All those "people running around" are the reason Bethesda knows they can get away with whatever they want now...shout out to everyone that pays $13 a month for a an unfinished game 😂

Again: relativity. 
---
You’re not terribly good at this, comrade.
---
I mean, its probably about par for the course for the typical griefing and whatnot that is ingame. I know for a stretch of at least a few months that I couldn't take any workshops, regardless how inconsequential, without getting hunted down by at least one person wanting to shoot people who were in adventure mode. Chances are they'll see the Fallout 1st outfit/icon and chuckle, go mess with the person, and then that's all. I've seen no indications of any sort of civil war though. At least, as some have said, ingame. On reddit here? Sure. Plenty of people spewing hate back and forth from both sides. I just try to keep my posts civil and focus on facts and comparisons from my own experiences.
---
I agree, everyone who paid for 1st should stay and absolutely everyone else should leave for pastures new. No point being nostalgic for the past, live in the now. Leave those who want to pay Bethesda to Bethesda and the rest can all observe and see how that works out for them.

Soooooo... I take it you work for Bethesda?

Also, everything thinking it's going to be BGS kissing this subreddit's ass over the fo1st tantrum is going to be mistaken
---
You should not have to pay for something that should have been in place to begin with. The monetization of virtually every aspect is what has caused Bethesda to catch so much flak. Look at GTA. You have a massive game with no subscription. You have no paywall. Only shark cards. And they have made a huge amount of money doing just that. No locked cosmetics.  Nothing is locked behind a paywall. If you want it you simply work for it and it is not a massive grind to do it.
---
I’m not sure why your life is so miserable you have to nitpick someone’s comment when it’s blatantly obvious that you’re health is not precisely 20% at all time no matter what. I don’t take a bullet then use 1 bullets equivalent of healing. 
---
You roll with ~20% health, you get mobbed, your nerd rage kicks on at 15%, you fight your way out, you heal at ~10% and repeat this process indefinitely. 
---
If I had any suspicion that you’re actually stupid enough to need this explained to you and not that your comment was purely dickish for the sake of being dickish I wouldn’t have given you a dickish response.
---
Nah. I will continue to play and not pay for 1st.
---
Only time I ever have issues is at the queen when people are running Strangler PA and using explosive plasmas. The acid cloud will bog down performance but I've never crashed.
---
So I bought the game, but I have no right to speak of it, unless I pay?
---
And I thought it should be what was meant to be on launch not one year later.

---
Life lessons in the Wasteland
---
&gt;If you ignore the warning when taking the workshop, then maybe you should learn the hard way, get rekt again and again so you don't comeback unprepared.
---
Missed the point (Unsurprising), You'll notice that I didn't "defend" the low level player, they claimed a workshop and got the warning. IF the bully actually WANTED PvP he would of attempted it with the OP, but they didn't did they? When they actually had a the potential of getting their ass handed to them, they jumped world, thus all they wanted to do was shit on the low level player. AKA Bully.
---
This game just boils my piss with how stupid it is sometimes.
---
I mean, even before Fallout 1st, I couldn't take a workshop because people would just hunt me down and force PvP as much as they could. Only thing that's changed with Fallout 1st is that I can now hop on my own server and grab workshops without having to worry about that crap.
---
Bethesda says it doesnt and that it only occured during very specific times. I guess you had to repeatedly crash your game to desktop/dashboard at a certain point in the raid
---
Definitely not P2W.
---
Are you on PC?

---
What platform are you on?
---
Vampire and ghost hunting are permitted but witches are endangered and are on a no-hunt list.
---
First week I did it everyday. Second week, if I remember correct, talk about loosing everything bug started and ppl lost interest. The timers was horrible triggers because of the server lagg other than that they were pretty straight forward.
---
I hope they create mechanics as triggers and remove the awful timers. Expert run being ruined because of server side lagg is bs.
---
I played the event a few hours straight the day of and didnt crash once!
---
You don't have to?
---
I only run 1 monitor but I tab out of fullscreen all the time with no issues. (Sometimes I play with just speakers and come across a situation where I want my mic so I tab out and switch audio to my headset)
---
The goo comes from the Venus plants in the cranberry bog. Doesn’t spoil but be careful it breaks down when you scrap all junk. 
---
All without knowing the recipe you can’t craft it.
---
It'd be really nice to have an option somewhere to select which main menu music you want playing. Its not like it'd be hard, that's a client based thing.
---
GTA gets shit for it's LARGE grindwall, which people (Whales) bypass through the sharkcards...
---
Probably the best way to get legendary weapons at low level is to go to Whitesprings when it nuked and find a place to hide (try on a building roof). From there shoot at any and all ghouls, all you have to do is inflict some damage and leave the actual killing to someone else. Once dead, go to the ghoul's body and retrieve the loot. As long as you "helped" in killing it you will receive loot from the slain.
---
I agree fantastic event
---
Window Boarderless? That is what I not ally run. The game is laggy an I get a lot of micro stutters.
---
I’m running a I7 7700k with a MSI Gaming 1080, 16gigs of 3200mhz ram. I have the game installed on my SSD as well.

How so?  
---
I like what they're offering, just haven't the money for it.

You may need to redownloaded Fallout 76 to fix the constant crashing? If all else fails, those PS are smooth. Find a friend to join up on!
---
Yes the timers are pure frustation when server lagg and response time is 2+ min lol
---
True fans? More like true morons.
---
The true fans of Fallout haven't even touched the games since Fallout New Vegas.
---
You can get "goo" from West Tek. There are a few around the lav area, one in the green tank area, at the end of the walkway.
---
I told someone this before but subscription services are everywhere and will be the future of the industry without lootboxes.
---
From how many scrap boxes I see in PC servers, I'd say it's futile.
---
They didn’t even bring the orange pip boy back.
---
I've had it fail to complete twice already. No rewards, nothing.
---
Yeah, they were waiting for the shitstorm to blow over a little
---
 Patrick!!!!!!!
---
I feel like the excessive grind needs to be lessened off by adding more points for doing things in-match.
---
IMHO it incentivizes the rampant hacking because the goal post is too far so people would rather spend the 10$ *(or whatever it is I don't actually know for this game)* a month on hacking tool subscriptions.
---
Which is a little rich if you think of the latest controversy - I guarantee that *some* people who take an issue with F1st have spent equal amount or more on these tools.
---
We played 5 of us last night and played 4 rounds and either one or two if us got DC’d at the end part whilst fighting in the courtyard... I’m on XB if that makes any difference....
---
right.  it kills the other side of the workshop play: being a crafting location
---
Strange, I thought your company’s latest statement before releasing this event was about how you’re not going to release buggy content anymore
---
At least you can sell them for a few caps after the event is over.
---
Yeah, Ive been seeing that a lot. I think most crash issues might have just been on console. I get DC'd sometimes but thats usually when my internet is deciding to drop to 5kbps
---
Glad to see you triggered on this.
---
That argument works if they were called "PvP Battle Arenas," but they are not.
---
LOL. Legitly funny.
---
Wish I had money to give you gold for the comment, but I spent it on Fallout 1st.
---
I think you're confusing Tuesday and Thursday. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ikCA2Cdhfl09FNTxXFOAE/atomic-shop-update-14-items-and-sales-october-29
---
That's good, but it's still a nuisance lol
---
But that is coming next decade..
---
🦹‍♀️
---
Probably because it would age badly.  I'm sure they'd want something that would prevent them from having to redo it in a week or two.
---
But seeing that Wastelanders is now several months away, I would love for either a new intro or a return to the old one.  The Nuclear Winter one never sat right with me.  If that's the first thing you saw playing 76, I think you'd get the wrong idea of what the game is about.
---
Yeah, really wish they imported some of the fo4 wasteland workshop devices.  What there is seems to be an illogical grab bag.
---
Kill and/or get rid of nvidia-experience?
---
I'm running fo76 on the same cpu/ram/drive, but with a 1060 on 2\*32" and 1\*19" and in Borderless. Sure I get a few less fps (10-15) than with fullscreen, but no flicker or CTD because of switching to another prog on another display.
---
Oh, and I got rid of all the grass...
---
Lol I know right, people upset cuase they're not getting generic responses from the Beth bot, 
---
Let me help, she will pass it on to the team, and they're looking into it, they are aware
---
I've only had one crash on xbox one. Very leggy at the end. But it's been grand otherwise.
---
I found psychotats. Can that be broke down into psycho?
---
That's the patch update... OP's asking where the Inside the Vault article is. That's a Thursday thing.
---
You can get an in-game plan for the vases fwiw. 
---
Now that they've done it with the pumpkins shelves - I think they should go all in make the vase scrap object a requirement for the CAMP vase placement.
---
It may be annoying at first but I think long-term it gives meaning to stuff like that.
---
Same here on PC, i have been on a couple laggy servers but thankfully not crashed.
---
It was more of a warning that there's alot of high level enemies, I know they paid for the game, they can join in. Like I said, it was more of a warning.
---
That would make things so much better. I'd like to see them go to a MMORPG style XP system for it really. Make it so that anyone in the party within a certain range will still get XP, but have it be like 70% if you have 2 players, 60% with 3, and 50% with 4 players. That way you can have the team going through and killing things and while you may get less XP per kill, you earn it faster because the whole time doesn't have to focus on the same stuff, they can spread out the kills easier.
---
They really should have just given owner an opt in popup with a countdown.  All they did was make workshops useless for pve folks.
---
I pulled out about 80 stim packs from my stash and my stash lost about 80 pounds of weight. With the maxed out weight reduction perk a single stimpack weights about 0.1. Without said perks it weights 1 pound each.  Throwing chems into your stash takes up more weight then keeping them in your inventory. The same thing with ammo. I had over 1k .45 and .50 ammo in my stash and pulling it all out increased my weight by like 1.5 pounds but opened up about 90 pounds of weight.  
---
You really have no idea what you are talking about do you?
---
Plus I didn't know you don't lose junk from the event.
---
Right, so you made up all kinds of things about me and responded like a moron. It makes more sense to manage your hp and stay just below 20% so it's always on, not wait til you're getting beat on to benefit from it. But you play how you like man
---
Hi, i am very interested in this method of yours. Can you pay me too? I will give you some thumpy ups and likeylikes for it. I promise you with this subscription you will never see negative posts of yours. Believe me if i say that 19,99 per month is worth that! :) Sounds nice right? \*Cough\*
---
You wired or wireless?
---
That, I cannot answer. Sorry.
---
It is good. I've enjoyed every one so far. Well, I've enjoyed the ones I managed to do without crashing, although i seem to crash constantly just at the start of the second section so i usually can reload and catch the finale.
---
Are you on console? Cause that seems to be a common thread
---
By
---
* using a mod manager if this exists on xbox
---
* asking in the fallout4 sub
---
* getting  cheap second xbox
---
My bad.
---
Yup xbox1.
---
Leader of the Pack and Horde events in the forest are you best bet at level 15.
---
I wish we could’ve gotten some better rewards, the costumes and jack-o-lantern are ok but I want some kind of high tier weapon reward that’ll keep me wanting to do the event again.
---
Borderless is a display setting... you might wanna start a post with the correct problems and your specs  to get help for that problem
---
Today is thursday, why today and last week there aren't????
---
 Still radio silence at BGS! lets be honest we probably ain’t getting another one or any more information about fallout first until the 2nd month subscription starts, if we do get anything at all..
---
Sorry, this is not the Fallout 4 sub, you should check out r/Fallout
---
Easy, get as many as you can and sell them 😎
---
Overwatch and Fortnight are the ones that come to mind.
---
what?
---
They are outstanding ways to experiment with modular base BP's.  Not having to waste resources experimenting is quite nice.
---
Destiny has some really Hard ráids and they implement Check points before any New segments... There is nothing more frustating then being in a Raid for an hour and Go back to the begening
---
I did the math, I should be able to run the event about 40 times if I make sure to log on for all that I can, but if the game crashes every time it lowers my chances of getting everything
---
Yep.
---
Because it caused a lot of controversy and if they aren't careful interacting with the players when making public statements they could stir up a lot of angry posts. Whether you like it or not its clearly a big issue for the community right now.
---
The point is to give an area to play with resources, and people MAY challenge you (the wording of the dialog) to try to take the space for themselves.
---
What it is now is better worded as, "Claim this workshop, and other players WILL come and fight you, even though usually it's not because they want the workshop, but rather they just like the psychological outlet they need because of their frail egos.  The good news is, usually these players only do it to low levels who are easily dominated, so if you are a high level, it's less common."
---
Bethesda, in their infinite wisdom and copious online gaming experience, didn't recognize how badly their game is imbalanced for PvP, and didn't realize that this workshop mechanic would result in a broken worshop in general, which facilitates small-ego'd players a method to help salve their small ego by griefing other players.
---
Faschnat is still my favorite!  But this is definitely second!
---
CAMPs are crafting locations, Flatwoods has crafting benches, the train stations have crafting benches.  
---
Workshops are the only places to get a larger amount of a certain resource.
---
This game is not made with the Unreal Engine lol
---
There's a costume trunk in the spring house for you to grab from
---
God help us if they remaster Fallout 3 then
---
Do not worry! They will be sure to let you do it next year......After you pay for it!
---
This. Only Carebears carry junk around.
---
You could try disabling dwm. This is so simple in win 7 on the older chipsets. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/6ranln/is\_it\_worth\_disabling\_dwm\_desktop\_composition\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/6ranln/is_it_worth_disabling_dwm_desktop_composition_for/)
---
You chose to be a prick so that’s what you get. Glad I have your blessing to play how I want to now. Sorry my 5% extra health than you wanted me to have triggered you so hard lol
---
Not sure if there is a mod manager.
---
Depending on how many mods you have, and want to use on the other account, you could install the mods you want for the second. Then on your main just disable what you dont want to use, enable the ones you do. Of course this will all depend on size due to limitations on console but if you only have a few then may work. Just remember to switch back around when you go on main account.
---
Buying another xbox is also a solution, but may not be practical!
---
If I remember correctly, they spawn as magazines with the holotape attached. I'll look into the exact spawn chance sometime this evening.
---
There’s a clip on youtube when it gets triggered. If I remember correct its if group leader quits the server and you stay in the raid untill kicked.
---
Thank you 😊
---
That's toxic goo
---
Gotta admit their social media team is better at their job than EA's though. Even just looking at the replies to OP you can see anything negative about the game (even just mentioning issues with no opinion on the company) immidiatly get a downvote wave while anything positive and telling us to suck it up and just play or even that we should be giving them more money gets a wave of upvotes very quickly.
---
Hunter/Killer radio is there.
---
Let's not forget that the PvP options all suck, and that's why only a minority of players like them because this game isn't really built for PvP.
---
I'd love it if they just had a battle arena -- A workshop on the board that is literally meant to be a battle arena, with some crafting.  Let all players who join the combat also have the crafting capabilities.
---
Where’s that? I do know of a few costumes already. Im just curious if anyone knows all the ones that count.
---
Get a mic 🥴
---
Yep, not sure how long your flagged even if you don't contest the changeover.  Long enough I got killed when I went there later for a critter attack event.  Better to just swap servers if you have a dedicated pvp person capping.
---
You have a strange definition of ultra loyal

meanwhile im just doing my own thing in my private sever alone.
---
i hear distant gunfire from live servers in the distance......
---
oh theres a war?
---
Dude, I know right  
---
/s  
---
Also this is the third damn time Ive replied to you, i'm following you now
---
Oh I very much doubt they'll even address the '1st' controversy in the *ITV*.
---
I've experienced crashes about 10% of the time on PS4. 50% seems exaggerated. In either case it sucks. Luckily when playing with a team it will help get you back in the action in time to complete the event if the crash happens while still in the "park" area of the event. If it crashes in the cottages or later, yet pretty much screwed.
---
They usally come around 5pm London time... Last week was no ITV because they released 4 arthicles in wednesday... Today I think they will release one... I just have no ideia what they are gonna talk about... they have nothing planned... Maybe statistics on Fallout 1st? To piss people off...
---
No problem, enjoy acting like you have the competence to comment about playing a bloodied character LOL...
---
Yeah man I have close to 1k of them so tossing you 100 won't set me back any lol. I'm working for the next few hours but I'll send you a request when I get online. My PSN is damian_13_666
---
exactly
---
Dinner!
---
You don’t clear it, you run past everything that doesnt block your way. Kill kings and hunters if needed other then that just run.
---
Enjoy dying a virgin
---
Hey, it got you to post.  Click-bait or not, it's a real issue, and workshops are broken.
---
Only problem.i had with it was not being able to opt out if it was contested.  I used to claim them for plans, base tinkering, or just to get more level appropriate pve events to spawn.
---
So annoying. The one time I need something I can’t find it anywhere.
---
Tried both couldn’t find it.
---
That was me!  I usually 90% of the time use Bolton Greens.  What i have been doing lately is video my games.  When i run into hackers, i upload the videos to youtube under private viewing and submit my links to Bethesda to review.  I have got 3 people kicked off or banned in some way already.  I would hope other people start recording their games and report.
---
It had to be a mask and a costume. I tried it with my which dress and which hat, but that didn’t count. So I paired it with a Fasnacht mask and it has counted since then.
---
Are you silly why do you want less things?! Only if they dropped the price... to like two thirds
---
So you want Nuclear Winter in Adventure mode instead of just doing Nuclear Winter, except it has crafting.
---
The game is built for PVP, seeing as how HKRadio was around when THE BETA launched, the community is more used to NPC/PVE combat but there are those who wanna PVP, let em. You're being a baby.
---
It's funny that the community managers finally crawled out of their holes for this but not during the Fallout 1st bullshit.
---
Is that the place that has the disease healing water fountain?
---
More assumptions, I'm sure you're a blast in real life
---
No, it's not. Workshops = consenting to PVP, regardless of whether or not the user is paying attention. Get over it.
---
Who else would a, stick around to play and b, pay a fortune(comparatively) to play an MMO where other players are supposed to populate the world and drive the adventures, privately(but not really) and tacitly accept being charged a subscription for a full price game to access paywalled content.
---
I meant clear the raid. Not the enemies. Don’t play it anyway, so it doesn’t matter to me.
---
I did try playing the rocking chair but it made no sounds whatsoever :(
---
I deleted the game and threw away my computer, phone and iPad, I now just use the internet with a pen, no risk of viruses or ransomware.
---
Fallout 4, even the kids smoked O.o
---
They spawn level appropriate defense events.  At least that's a big reason I used to snag them.
---
Booo hoooo
---
Or this sub reddit for that matter, lol
---
Everything about this made me laugh.
---
The title, the comment and of course the user name.
---
Please never change, and continue to do you!
---
I think you know the answer to this.
---
Yea. Sounds good. Ill send you a message and add you when i get home
---
Ye ok. Thing is I see a lot of ppl complain about this, lol so sorry my bad
---
I once claimed a workshop for the 'Claim different  workshops' quest when I was around lv 70. A lv 180 guy with 5 other workshops on the map comes ( I figured I no longer needed the workshop) and I wave at him. I didn't have time to leave and he kills me once. I wasn't gonna give him any more caps and just didn't come back. End results are the same, but that guy just showed that he was a douche and I was 50 caps poorer.
---
Absolute swing and a miss. Actually quit playing after the second week of raids and try to check forums now and then for improvements. However fallout 1st has pretty much killed any desire to return.
---
I haven't crashed once on Xbox One X. I only had a delayed respawn, during one event. The event is horribly laggy for sure. Runs like Vault 94 on benzos.
---
We got about 20 assaultrons at once last night. That was fun.
---
Just costume works. I wear my mantaman suit.
---
Nah, I get it. Wording was unclear. Rewards just aren’t that good for a melee build, and I’ve heard that some of them have tons of rads... And I don’t wear PA. 
---
So risk and rewards just aren’t worth it.
---
You just like being mean to people don't you :P look I didn't know that and of checking was that easy then you'd knew I was new on the platform.
---
Also I don't think it was very unreasonable, it's not like everyone is going to know what the Bethesda account names are
---
Hasn't crashed once on me 🤔
---
It should’ve been two tiers: 
---
1. Private Worlds only, $6.99/mo or $59.99/yr
---
2. Private Worlds, 1650 Atoms, free monthly exclusive cosmetics (Ranger Armor), Atom shop discount, $12.99/mo or $99.99/yr
---
And a third option: 
---
3. One-Time Bundle: Ranger Armor, 1650 Atoms, $12.99
---
Scrapbox and Tent free for everybody—or at the very least, free for existing players. Hell, they could’ve even gotten away with the Tent in the sub if it only worked on Private Worlds. 
---
If they had done this, there still would’ve been some outrage from the “Everything should be free all the time everywhere” crowd, but it wouldn’t be viewed with this much hostility, wouldn’t have pushed people away, wouldn’t have divided the community and wouldn’t have broken their initial cosmetics only promise. 
---
In turn, they’d probably have generated the same or more revenue, gotten better data (nobody subbing just to cancel right away for the outfit), and not suffered yet another PR shitstorm that will lead to lower game sales and damage to the company’s reputation. 
---
Whoever approved the plan they ran with should be fired for gross incompetence. This game needed this controversy like a hole in the head. 
---
With all that said, separating it from Wastelanders was a good move. When that launches it needs a controversy free window. All positive reviews, no “Wastelanders is great, but we need to discuss this terrible subscription”. It still should’ve been what I listed, but the separation is smart.
---
You know what I'm talking about. Workshops give you much more terrain and budget to play around with building things.  Not "crafting" in the exact sense, I'm sorry I wasn't precise enough for you.
---
I would love to see this. This sounds awesome 😂
---
Hmm interesting, thanks guys! At least I’ll know about this ahead of time and not be frustrated with it.
---
Because they could have included the scrapbox and tent into normal gameplay via quest or something for everyone. Price is debatable, but not extreme.
---
For a short period some months ago the restrictions were loosened and a few things were possible. Chairs pushed in under tables, tool boxes in the cubbie below the weapon bench, etc.  Then they patched and removed these abilities again, but if you had it you were allowed to keep it.  I had a dozen things in my camp I was scared to move because I know they don't work anymore. 
---
I have some friends whose camps still have these features and I've warned them not to move them.
---
So yes, it's gotten worse, again.
---
Damn, didn’t know this was a feature that was added then removed
---
Youre still asking for them to remove PVP just cause you don't like it, you snowflake.
---
I've definitely been crashing on PC. A \*lot\* more frequently after the last update.
---

---
According to  u/Frank__Lloyd__Wrong  
---
Lady Devann said it's coming, just later then normal.
---
Speechless
---
Probably stats about the event and to hype it up more.
---
love it but it feels incomplete still. Im geeked to see how this shit looks after a year
---
I'm not sure, I don't play any other games. I've been playing solo since I started but people are always willing to help with quests or specific items you're looking to buy, and the events are always interesting
---
Had 2 crashes the first evening after that not anymore with over 15 runs
---
every news time!! of the ???? week? the are It's Where second
---
Oh so did you not see the big text telling you you might be PvP eligible when you take the workshop?
---
She gave birth to a baby that would go on to subscribe to Fallout First, I don't think much can be said for her decency.
---
Yep, no crashes. Just the usual molasses feeling around The Whitesprings in general.
---
Unfortunately not exaggerated... I I've froze out of the game more times than I've completed it. 😪
---
If they had made the monthly price $9.99 USD per month, or the $99.99 USD for a whole year, and just had the servers, atoms, and special cosmetics that you can only get through the membership, there would have likely been far less criticism. People would have been *thrilled* to have that option for so cheap, and to get the scrap box and survival tent for free in the atom shop. Or even make a side quest for the tent and just put the scrap box in the atom shop for free. While I have the membership, I do wish they had done it that way
---
Last time I was checking his channel he made lore video for V51, not 94
---
The Tesla rifle is a good way to encourage a lot of PvP at one time. I only use it as a way to tag as many bots as possible though since I play with Pacifist on.
---
Cheers!
---
No one is stopping you from building/crafting... 
---
Just expect to be attacked while doing so. 
---
 If you take PVP away from workshops who's to stop you from taking over all of the workshops and never giving them up because there's no way for you to lose them.
---
 That would be a terribly stupid system.
---
Same in Xbox for me.
---
Quite frankly if you told me that the robot and fridge should be quest rewards and they sold skins I would agree. Tent and limitless scrap is other level advantage... I think it suits the paid model! My problem with this is that they release features in atom Shop and not in quest...
---
At least I have a real life 😂
---
#4- why i bought the game. thought it would be like GTA content wise. buy once and that's it. nope.
---
Only a Jedi is foolish enough to think that good will will persevere.
---
The workshops aren't broken, i've taken them multiple times, many times I go uncontested my entire playthrough.  I have yet to have people come and just hunt me down and not actually be trying to take the workshop. They are working as intended.  
---
They've made so many changes to other aspects of the game: taking away ability to damage player camps, removed slap damage, you have pacifist mode - there are so many options to stay out of PVP.  
---
Workshops are the PVP content. You are trying to change it to non-pvp content. 
---
calm down Joe Rogan
---
In the snow. Freezie-pop
---
Wanna get high?
---
Tried it both ways, blue screens each time I do the event. I haven't had many issues doing everything else but this event crashes my game hard.
---
\&gt;insert Shen comic here
---
It's nothing personal, it's just that what you described isn't how the game works. So either you told your story in the third person to seem less like you were whining, or you completely made it up.
---
Thanks I was wondering the same thing that explains why didn't get a bonus, I wonder if my owl head would do
---
They didn't advertise it, so if you weren't building frequently you might not have noticed. And then it was reverted so may have been a mistake to add it in the first place.  
---
It's less noticeable, but at the same time they loosened and then re-tightened the collisions with existing terrain. I lost a wall and roof not knowing I wouldn't be able to re-place it. I have a few now that I refuse to move; I'm sure I won't be able to get them back in.
---
take it you know that this can be picked up just about anywhere. Just depends on the rng, and you might not find it in h/ferry. but its on the side with the train wreck.
---
Everything, the tent, fridge, scrapbox and the scavenger bot should have been quest integrated rewards. The atom shop should only sell cosmetics. That's the line and they crossed it.
---
what am i looking at?
---
I'm certain that there has been trolling toward 1st subscribers in-game, like with anyone else, but it's hardly a "war".
---
At the bottom of list UI is a message stating whether the currently selected item is in the current vending machine or a different one.

---
There is a road with a piano sitting in the middle of it. I believe the ruined pharmacy building is on that road.
---
To prevent freezing, I now follow the bot and don't shoot anything move to the final boss area and tag it while hiding.
---
I'm getting some rewards and a 1\*, before if I really joined in I froze or crashed when robots attacked and never got a tag on the boss? It's leaching off of others but my tato PC can't cope it seems.

I didn't say you defended the low level player, but the low level player knew there is going to be PvP, and this sort of thing happens PvP.

It’s your own fucking fault for playing this trash game.

I got the pirate hat from the event

If FO1st also included a way to transfer items between your characters, I'd be willing to shell out and give it a try

Same, except levels 91, 57, and 41. 2 games each, including the one from vault 76.

How exactly would it be "shilling" to release loot spawn chances?

Nice. :D
---
I’m confused? In the build menu there’s 5 pumpkin rack variants but there’s only showing 4 rewards?? I want the completely empty one!
---
Nice! I always scrap them when I get them. I’ll hold on to the next one I get. Had a nice executioners explosive one before. I’m sure an instigating explosive one with reload speed would be awesome.

I'm a troll? You're a fuckin dick, actually. They released a statement and said "You guys said you want more utilities! And based on our numbers of sales here they are!"

Take all costumes off, you should get a misc objective when the event is active telling you to put a costume on to earn extra rewards. This way you can test which pieces of clothing complete the objective. I learned this way that you can get away with just wearing the fireman uniform and no helmet, or just the helmet and no uniform.
---
No. Fake news! 
---
Fallout has used the Creation engine fir tue last few games.
---
You got problems
---
Its is good, but like the rest, xbox1...crashes all the time.
---
I also can rarely find the event. With Fashnat all i had to do was server hop once or twice amd id find another one.  I jumped servers over 10 times last night and couldnt find another one, same thing the day before. Idk how people are doing this event on repeat.
---
Really really odd.
---
Same. The game runs like shit during the event around Whitesprings
---
Haven’t really experienced any lag or crashes on xbox during the event.
---
Boi here I am.
---
1 outfit is not enough for an entire circus :D
---
Oh wow. Your actually attempting to re-label bully as “cleaver tactics” seriously?!
---
Remind me, in the OP, was the low level player running away or actually trying to engage our wannabe Sun Tzu?
---
You'll see. Get back at me when the special area with more legendary monsters for FO1st players is released. Or the special faction vendors for 1st players. You're in denial bud.
---
Haven't crashed once i must be lucky,  it is kinda laggy though.
---
The game is widely known to be plagued by glitches and stability issues.  At no point is this more apparent than when there’s a lot of shit going on such as a large fight with many enemies.
---
So what does Bethesda do? Release an even that involves blowing up cars while being attacked by robots, some of which explode after dying. Oh and there’s also ghouls. 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Do they WANT people to hate this game and stop playing? I’m so confused.  Why do they keep shooting themselves in the foot? For each of these poor choices that they’ve made, is it always just a different individual on the dev team that has a bright idea and then they all jump on board? Or do many people there actually think that some of the decisions they make are reasonable?
---
There is no one inside the vault, or Bethesda higher-ups' brains.
---
I haven't really seen any myself.. just hear about them here
---
I was asking myself why I didn't found these 2 events together yet...
---
... I still hope to get into a server someone Nukes Whitespring during the Mischief event.
---
I just cant.. stop.. looking.. 🤤🥴 it's a bit stressful seeing this though... I want wastelanders to work well SO BADLY...
---
Bethesda said if you cancel the subscription you keep the atoms
---
Finally found it! But I wasted over 100 coins on fast travels :(((
---
... People are actually still playing this game?
---
This will be a really bad week for them to skip  ITV.  i enjoy the fallout 1st service, but I can see that many in the community want answers.  The ducking, hiding, ignoring approach is a bad look.
---
it has crashed on me on the PS4 a couple times.
---
It is usually when I am fast traveling to the location, then by the time I get back in the event is over and I have to wait an hour.
---
The other times it has crashed was when the event ends and it is giving the rewards. When I get back in my rewards have been in my inventory each time though, so I'm not as concerned about that.
---
Angry raiders vs Insecure Whales, what a classical conflict
---
The event happens every hour, in the hour
---
And you're insane.
---
I’ve heard some people have had this problem but I have had no problem with it I’ve gotten all the rewards. I hope your able to get a few rewards  between the crashes.
---
Only issue I've had is it has never given me the "Event completed" pop up with the rewards list. And it crashes 20% of the time. And wouldn't let me respawn once, stuck in dead mode. That's a new one. Other than those issues, fine...
---
I have data that shows the community wants to give me money and be punched in the balls. You can't see the data, but I have it. 
---
See how easy that is? They are just putting their greedy bullshit lying excuse on "the community" instead of just telling us they want to milk our wallets for every cent
---
I haven't crashed during the event once on PC..
---
also got the complete pirate suit and hat on back to back runs
---
So a troll tells a internet user not to be a dick while being a troll... okay.
---
The newbie took a workshop and by taking one he agreed to do PvP with whoever wants it, simple as that. How he performed does not matter. The newbie even tried to get help to take revenge lol.
---
Huh....guess ill keep looking..or waiting
---
&gt; I think that you can get raw data to say whatever you want it to.
---
&gt;You can also inflate that number quite a bit with
---
You can also just lie, we don't see any of their data
---
Blow up a car near a ghoul poking the floor, it loses one arm and leg, i turn my back cause it's no problem without the leg, and in the same poking the floor position comes at its normal speed, does a 0,1 second T pose, and proceeds to slap me with its missing arm, killing me on 1 slap because of the poison some of them have.
---
It had me on the first half, not gonna lie
---
We have an older Xbox One as well as a One S. Both will lag. Both will screen freeze and crash. I get the most lag around multiple explosions happening at once. I’ve had screen freezes and crashes at load-in to the event, right in front of the cottages, and in the courtyard. Today I attempted three events at 9, 10 and 11 eastern; I was booted/froze up the first two and was only able to complete the third one with a fresh machine reboot before playing because I could not even get the game to load at that point.
---
It starts at the top of the hour, every hour.  So, it doesn't matter what server you're on.
---
Dude, you are a dick. You're literally being a dick to me on 2 different threads and don't even notice it.
---
So in layman’s terms it’s an impossible plan to get this event...?
---
My store would never give it away for free :( They've been on clearance for a month, and at this point have been input as "salvage" into the system (hence the $0.00). Technically they're not supposed to sell it to you. I got one when they went to 50% off, and I got another yesterday too. Because it still had the sticker for 70% off, they manually put in that price.
---
I will never understand why people don't just stop playing and play something better. Makes no sense to read the wall of "omg my event keeps crashing" and not just shake my head. Plenty of other games, quit supporting trash, you continuing to log in and play just tells them what they are doing is ok.
---
So everone has to wait an hour before doing it again?? Thanks tho, that helps
---
Yeah I’ve been trying to grind out this event for the costumes but I’ve had it crash on me far too many times and it’s so off putting when it happens.
---
Let me preface this with: I'm strictly a PvE player. I also take workshops occasionally to collect resources, acquire plans, or test CAMP builds. I very, very rarely get attacked, but it has happened.
---
The workshop system is working as intended. Your complaint is not valid when game is working as it is designed to around the workshop. Workshops are designed to be contested, and you are clearly warned that another player may decide PvP to to contest your ownership of it. Workshops offer the benefits of easy resource farming, bigger build budgets, and their own stockpile of junk to build with but you pay for those benefits by having to defend it against waves of mobs and other players. This is a fair trade in my eyes.
---
Perhaps your issue is the disparity between the workshop holder (lvl. 12) and the workshop "contester" (lvl. 167)? Yeah, that's unsportsmanlike of the higher level character, but that is how the game works and the workshop holder signed up for this when he/she claimed the workshop. After getting killed, the low-level character could have opted to simply respawn instead of returning to the workshop a few more times to get ambushed and lose caps. Basically, this event happened because the players involved made conscious choices in the game. Are you proposing that choice should be taken away from the players?
---
Ehhhhhh, I'm conflicted!
---
I love the game, me and my family play it when I travel for work. I am starting to think the whole game is a vault experiment itself 🤣
---
Yeah, I've noticed some small changes here and there to settings. I didn't even know the filter was a option, seems like it should be the only option to keep venders separate. I need to check if I have pacifist still on
---
Enjoy the pay2win
---
Any fallen tree should give you the option to gather wood. If you wander around your camp I’m sure you’ll gather a bunch!
---
Really odd the wide variations of experiences.
---
I'm not on atm but Picketts Fort... all the way north east in the toxic valley is a great source of wood.  Use the woodchucker perk in the Luck tree to maximize results. 
---
With that perk on you will get well over 100 wood in the 1 spot.
---
Yes. It was probably forgotten. Given that it's a week long event, I don't think it will get fixed.
---
I dont have the newest console, but I did just buy my one S -new a couple months ago.. I really hope that's not the case... I still know people using the original xbox one.. I'd feel sorry for them..
---
that has been most of my crashes. When I am looting the legendary robot, luckily the legendary loot item is first on the list so I can grab it, then when the robot explodes it crashes my game, but when I get back in I have my event rewards in my inventory as well.
---
Just like all the glitches
---
I think the people who paid for 1st have the problems. Deep psychological issues.
---
You know as customers you should not care about these things, or rather you don't have to consider these things.
---
You paid, they took the payment, and they must deliver what's paid for.
---
LOL beats my blue screen I got after killing the legendary robot
---
All the makings of a a masterpiece.
---
Boo
---
No. You, have legit mental problems.
---
Why?
---
Yes, that is correct.  I think it makes it easier to plan for at least.  I can only play a couple hours or so each night so its nice to know exactly when its going to run and how many times I'll be able to run it.
---
The floor slider ghouls were out in force in one of the few I was able to complete without disconnecting.  Nothing like being chased by a sleeping ghoul
---
You gotta buy a subscription for that.
---
Full Subscription for games usually means buying the full price game and all the expansions with it...
---
That would spell the death of 76.
---
I know exactly what you mean. When this whole shot show started someone called me a broke peasant for not buying this garbage subscription. Regardless if it’s a lot of money for someone or not it’s a terrible value for $100. Also just out of principal alone I wouldn’t buy it either.
---
Reddit is our dialogue tree
---
Thats exactly it
---
The lumber mill right by vault 76 is where I get all of my wood from. If you have the woodchucker perk it makes it a lot easier.
---
You are not running the company, you have no responsibility to care. That's why I also added "you don't have to".
---
Ye ofc, they try to force ppl in to play it and that can only be for one reason 😄
---
Good job and thanks!
---
I've failed it once. but even that was still super fun! For some reason TONS of colonial gutsies spawned and wiped out all but 2 or 3 people immediately!
---
I think this would make a needless distinction. There is an excitement and thrill to the game when taking a workshop, knowing that you're open to random PvP attacks. You play the game differently (stash things immediately, hide all the time, etc.) that contribute to the fun and tension. Why take that away to define select safe zones? After level 75, a lot of the game gets easier. The workshops balance that out.
---
If they were priced better, sure.  Case in point: the pump action shotgun has a Responders skin for 500 *.  I'm not spending 2-3 weeks of grinding or $5 in atoms for a single skin for a single gun. Same for power armor paints: 1800 *: $18 or about 2 months of playing for me.
---
There's loads of skins I'd love to buy, even for real money. Just not at current prices.
---
After perusing the comments,  it seems to be predominantly an Xbox issue.
---
I dunno, pray?
---
even without green thumb, I did a loop around all the houses in the area and I had 29 pumpkins by the time I made it back to the pumpkin house. I was mostly getting pumpkins for the new camp items I have, but had enough pumpkins to do the quest as well.
---
You can't always trust the pop up. I've seen it glitch out a couple times. If you get one of the following: a jack o lantern plan, a pumpkin rack plan, the vault boy cutout, short pumpkin suit, pumpkin pantsuit, pirate hat, or pirate costume, then you got all 5 rewards. That group of rewards will only drop if you are wearing a costume.
---
Nice idea, but until Survival mode is brought back, PVP'ers are gonna PVP, and Raiders are gonna Raid...
---
Lower your graphics settings
---
Best one yet was when the legendary sentry came out, and I emptied a clip into him from about 10-15m away and no hit markers came up.
---
They killed it in under 10 seconds and I got no loot. Big mad.
---
most of them would remain in this mode, with this suggestion
---
I as well am crashing 1 in 4 times on xb1, usually at the sentry fight.
---
(PS4) I had it crash once so far out of maybe 5 or 6 play-through.
---
If you do it the way the quest markers tell you, it's not necessarily easy because it takes you over to the fissure and the inevitable scorchbeast battle. But yeah, with the pumpkins around the house, it takes like five seconds, and the grenades aren't that useful either.
---
I'm a rare player who ran the raids multiple times per day in the beginning.  So at one point I was a 10 on that first one, though I've crafted the armors I wanted so I'm no longer running it regularly.
---
As for fun factor, in the beginning it was either a 6-10 depending on the mission.  So the "collect 50 keycards" mission I always felt was a 6 - kind of fun but a missed opportunity salveaged mostly by the somewhat interesting end fight.  Dead in the water I liked the most and it was a 10 on a good day, and washout was a solid 8.
---
The first time I completed expert mode was an awesome and rewarding experience that required dedication (multiple failed attempts learning from each), strategy, and teamwork.
---
But to qualify all of that - the missions are only fun when you have a stable and relatively lag free server to play them on.  When you have a laggy server the fun factor is 0 as the missions can literally be unplayable.
---
Now that I know the missions inside and out, it's still a reasonably fun time with friends who know what they are doing and it's a great source of resources.  People who deride vault 94 because "the expense isn't worth it" are batshit crazy as I come out of there with vastly more ammo (in the form of bulk ammo thingies), stims, disease cures, and whatever junk I want than I went in there with.  Especially now that they've boosted the rewards massively.  I never had to worry about gathering mats to craft ammo while raiding.
---
It's a shame that the servers are so laggy and the instancing tech is so shoddy.  I feel like the missions would have been much better received if they run like they do on a private server.  A lot of people missed out on a good and fun challenge.
---
The WV Lumber Co. in the northwest corner also has a ton of wood to collect, plus super mutants (my favored foe)!
---
Consider getting the Contractor perk in the INT tree to reduce your building cost.
---
They drinking 1950's nuka-cola.
---
Picket fort- wood perk from luck =&gt; 800 wood per run (piles of chopped wood)
---
I have attempted to join the event twice. Walking straight into the event from the Whitesprings fast travel spawn point, it crashed both times within a minute of joining the event.
---
The trunk has only ever had two hats in it for me, clown hat and tinfoil cap
---
the other thing that has happened a lot recently is when I am loading into the world for the first time. It will just hang on the loading screen. I can sometimes hear things, but I can't see anything and the only way I have found to fix it is to force close the game.
---
I've been crouching and moving very slowly, also staying as far away as possible from everyone else and all the exploding cars, dying robots, and automatic laser rifles. Haven't crashed since I started doing that
---
Ive seen a lot of people crashing, I havent crashed myself yet, and Ive done it like, 7 times
---
Lol i crash at about the time that leg. enemy spawns in so instead of getting a hit on it i just hide by jes2r an look at the ground ... Sweet more ranger outfit clean
---
 xoxo Todd
---
I've noticed a lot more delay in loading. My only thought is now the the first subscription has had time to sell people have bought it and all that extra scrap is causing the same loading problems that we had months ago.
---
The AAA "Masterpiece"
---
I got the shark ghouls too.
---
It's a PS4 issue too. My wife and I both have trouble with Mischief Night on our PS4s. Usually in the evening, too, when both of us are actually home to play.
---
I find Psycho frequently in the Raider camps
---
I get horrible performance doing that event the engine is clearly not made for multiplayer.
---
It's not just crashes.   
---
For me it lags so horribly I can't move for a few minutes; I've yet to be able to do the whole thing even when I get there early. Once it starts I can't move for a bit and then I'm stuck playing the slowest game of catch-up ever. I get to see the event start and sometimes if I'm very good and cross my fingers I get to the legendary at the end just in time to shoot at it a couple of times.  
---
No crashes, but it's still not playable.
---
My muchine gun broke while reloading, game switch to my dragon with 250 ammo and the animation for muchine gun fire
---
Bethesda will read this response as "increase volume and awareness of emotes" lol
---
Thank you Doctor, could you explain your diagnosis? If I may make a rejoinder to your opening argument of ‘no you’ I would respond’ No, YOU’ I can see even by this opening exchange of verbal sparring why only the elite level of humanity, the very zenith of evolution defend Fallout 1st.
---
They had one job and they let them down man, they paid money for perks and pc players like one of my close friends did and he’s confused why he has nothing. This is why you watch what happens on errors and bugs THEN proceed to purchase. Then again this game is a buggy mess...
---
Zeni didn't exactly borrow money, but they took investor's money to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars (for a % stake in the company, though the exact % isn't known).
---
So now the investors are 'steering' Zeni to provide a good return on that investment.  That return is *likely* a company that has a relatively steady income stream, as opposed to huge revenue spikes when a new game is released.  One way to provide a more steady income stream is...you guessed it...monthly subscriptions.
---
Once the income is steadied, the valuation of the company shifts a bit, making it more appealing to other people who might want to buy out the investors' shares, or to make an IPO more viable (at least on paper).
---
So...who to blame?  The investors, for wanting a different profit profile in the game they invested in?  Zeni, or selling out in the first place?  BGS, for doing what Zeni/investors are telling them to do?
---
Honestly, if the music stopped when I stopped dancing, it would probably resolve on its own.
---
This is actually a better post than your previous one.
---
But no, having workshops PvE only would make the whole thing "first come first served", considering the amount of server one have access to and how unique workshops are, it will be inconvenient for other players.
---
If you think about it, it's more fair if the strong gets the workshops because no one actually owns them.
---
This too, It's the little things that make a big difference.
---
They've boosted the rewards twice.  The missions are a challenge for a team of 4 and balanced just fine for that goal, only people who complain are those trying to solo it or people who just don't bother to learn the missions well enough to complete them on a timer.
---
But yeah, lag is what ruins them.  I have a couple buddies that bought fallout 1st and the missions are smooth as silk on a private server but it's bullshit that you need to pay for a stable enough server to run it :(
---
I like picking up loot from fallen players
---
I just bought an anti-armor ecplosive/ extra dmg while aiming black powder pistol, yesterday! Instigating or quad explosive the dragon would be pretty rad!
---
Mischief Night is fun, a good second favorite. Only downside is all the chaotic objectives cause lag. Fasnacht Day is my #1. The best feature that doesn't make it to any other event is there are cool robots that walk around showing off potential rewards on their heads. I think more events should showcase rewards like this.
---
I get this quite often and I chalk it up to lag from a previous shootout. I don't get it if I've never engaged with any enemy during my play session. It's always after I've been in a fight. I think the server just gets laggy and doesn't always apply the damage on-time and then catches up later. The thing that made me start noticing this is that one time I was attacked by ghouls and didn't take hardly any damage. Beat them all off and then about 10 minutes later, halfway across the map, my character grunted about 5 times, lost almost all my health and suddenly got rad worms.
---
But what does it cost to put a new game on the market or maintain a competitive approach in the gaming industry?  If they didn’t take that money would they be able to put out a game on the next series of consoles?
---
Should? Who am I to say what someone ‘should’ or ‘shouldn’t’ do or think?
---
Well I also don't agree things are P2W.
---
But Bethesda surely did not deliver lol.
---
Never had it crash on me, but it is pretty slow (PC here)...sorry to hear about it crashing :(
---
Typical Bethesda..
---
Read carefully.
---
When you log in select Private Server instead of Adventure.
---
Can you win without the fridge or basic repair kits?
---
Saw another player shark it out for a few feet. Except their legs were in the crouched position above their head so looked kinda like a crab lol
---
God they should hire you, I’d grind to be my soul, a witch with a shot gun running into raider camps
---
I see what you did there. 😂
---
Would you even believe what they said?? That's the problem with liars......
---
Ah, never played those. But yes, they are kids games (thought I know a lot of adults play them too), i'd expect a lot of toxicity. Ironically I view FO76 as being much closer to D3 or PoE than I do Fortnight or Overwatch, despite the first two being ARPGs and the 2nd two being shooters.
---
o0o nice! 
---
A quad Dragon sounds awesome. 
---
The purveyor just hooked me up with an AA/E/250 Harpoon Gun. First great drop in a long while. That would go pretty good with a pirate outfit.
---
Read carefully...
---
Not sure if its related to mischief night, but my map went nuts last night.  Everytime I moved the cursor it was like a prism exploded and the whole screen turned into this spastic color wheel.   This was on xbox.
---
If you could I would visit and have a group trip for pumpkin craving if they allowed it in...
---
That was my first drop, I learned it too, it it a rarer one?
---
Can you win without the store?
---
Hop player vendors that have a high number of meds in them. You'll probably find someone with a stack.
---
it’s not rarer then the others. i just keep getting it
---
Played it 10 times, no crashes (PC)
---
I said read carefully, because I said I don't agree with them saying there is P2W.
---
That makes absolutely no sense. If it WAS true that cosmetics were the biggest bought items, it doesn't track that they would pivot AWAY from what they know is profitable; if anything they'd double down on it. They'd make it more accessible and with a larger catalog.
---
Think about what you've said: They're going to manipulate their data, which helps guide their business and design decisions, to look a way other than what has been proven to be profitable, so that they can justify changing the game to a model that hasn't. Like they're bending over backwards to push some sinister microtransaction hell despite how the cosmetic-focus store has been profitable.
---
Or, maybe, their data is telling them that utility items sell better, not realizing that it's saying that because of fundamental design decisions that push players towards making those purchases.
---
One of those is lack of insight into the function of their product, which they've been guilty of before ("It's an undocumented feature, not a bug.") The other is a conspiracy theory.
---
Oh, I misread it, I thought you put that you didnt have it drop
---
Why is it no one ever initiates PvP with me?
---
My point.
---
I could sit here and come up with so many little ideas they should add, even ones they could monetise.. pls give me job Bethesda I hate my day life😂😂
---
Yeah I'm playing on a potato pc and I don't crash with the settings moved to low
---
it should of been like Meat Week but instead of running around getting prime cuts we could of went to different towns trick or treating to get Halloween candy between the main event.
---
 **Players are having trouble placing the Vintage Halloween Cat Decor** 
---
u/Aten_ra i'm not sure if its appropriate or necessary to append to this but personally i've been unable to place it on Metal, Brick and Concrete Foundation pieces also. It just disappears into the structure.
---
This would’ve been awesome!
---
Hey Netflix, get Todd on the phone I found a Saturday cartoon I’d watch and eat cereal to like when I was a kid!
---
Very true, I'm just use to other games I play (like bl3) having event screens.  Since the halloween event ends on the 12th for the nuclear winter bonuses, its only 2 weeks long while compared to BL3 being 6 weeks long.  
---
That being said they could also do another nuclear winter opening for the new map, with a different theme song (emphasis on new theme song).  Or like op said just go back to the original classic.
---
As fun as ultra settings is even the best of us suffer
---
I’d say the people upset someone spent their own 12$ are the insecure people.
---
Actually no this is one of the data miners. You can check my past posts and see that on the ama they are pare of the group
---
Just a theory.
---
Zenimax gave Bethesda several hundred million dollars as an investment expecting a return.  Bethesda spent that money on a passion project instead of a guaranteed money maker hoping to monetize afterwards when/if it became popular.  Game came out to mixed and poor reviews which had its retail price down to a fraction of what it should be in a few weeks.  Fast forward to a game that is still dragging its knuckles trying to get the ball rolling and an impatient Zenimax is saying where is mine Todd? While also possibly looking for an exit strategy on a bad investment in their eyes.  So they force Bethesda to add the monthly sub and yearly option which makes them money in the short term and also makes their investment look better if they are indeed planning an exit strategy aka selling their stake in Beth.
---
Only 5 times? It freezes up on me at least 30-50 percent of the time. Really frustrating. At least Fasnacht was always running somewhere...
---
Thanks!!
---
It’s happening on social media, so far in game I haven’t noticed a bit of it... maybe 2 times I’ve seen people riot outside the 76 vault and it’s pretty impressive.
---
I'm on a mountain not much I'll see what I can do 😅
---
Same for me.
---
Or I just continue wiping any excavator boi dumb enough to take a workshop off the map 💁
---
PS4
---
That could be a small part but the investors are bigger than Zeni.
---
*aggressively praises Moth*
---
I’m also on xbox.. even going slow I’m crashing 1 out of 3 times.. tricks being played on us by bethesda for sure 👎
---
THIS community- no one outside of here cares.
---
You're thinking of astroturfers. Which all of the people who don't play the game are. The large majority of people making post and complaining didn't play the game you know, they'll freely admit it. They were attempting to make it seem like the playerbase was more upset than they were, which is really disingenuous. Do you play the game OP?
---
Private worlds kinda ARE persistent, at least for 20 mins. What if they just boost that timer? And what if the camp budget is increased but not the circumference, that wouldn’t affect the map or other player boundaries. As for mods, no idea how they’re going to approach that. Maybe submitted mods have to pass a Bethesda certification?
---
It currently does (i.e. if I update my camp in private it carries over to public) but right now there is no expanded camp budget.  
---
There are a few ways they could do this: 
---
* Different camps for Public vs. Private
---
* Lock characters to Private (least likely)
---
* Tell the player that their camp cannot be placed because it exceeds public camp budget
---
* Allow the player to bring their massive camp over.
---
My best guess on the mods is it will work like the creation club does today, I would not be surprised if the mods had a cost assoicated with them. But we don't know, they say they want mods sometime in the future, and I agree they don't want people to make the atom shop redundant, but at the same time I don't think they want the backlash again of paid mods (though they kinda do that with Creation Club today)
---
I don't really like the legendary loot cycle. I think Legendaries, if they exist in game at all, should be craftable, forcing people to trade. Also when you think about it, it's a loot box system.
---
Mr. T cereal? 😂
---
Haha
---
Thankfully you are not a pysch professional eh? Would be horrible at your job.
---
&gt;But what does it cost to put a new game on the market 
---
For a AAA game, commonly $50-$150 million.  Can be less or more, but that's a decent estimate.  That's an easy question.  Though, I can't imagine 76 took nearly that much, since it was built on an existing platform, but that's a different question.  Fallout 5 would likely be in that range, assuming they use a new engine to start.
---
&gt;or maintain a competitive approach in the gaming industry
---
Very little to infinity.  Reputation is a key here.  For some games, they sell themselves, and as long as the game works well, it can take very little to maintain.
---
For 76, since it's reputation is rather tarnished, it takes more.  If it had released well, and been done right up front, it would be a lot cheaper.
---
&gt;If they didn’t take that money would they be able to put out a game on the next series of consoles
---
If they sell well in previous games, sure.  If they bomb continually, not so much.  Unfortunately that's not a simple question to answer, not knowing the accounting of BGS or Zeni at all.
---
All of that is, of course, not terribly relevant to the discussion, since the issue is how they're screwing up 76.  The old model seemed to be working, though it's working less well these days.  Someone is trying to adapt to a newer kind of market (not saying they *need* to, but that's what they're doing).  
---
Who made that decision, and who is responsible for trying to make it work, are two different questions that certainly apply here, and we don't really know the answers to that (though it's easy to come up with a reasonable guess).
---
I thought unreal was listed in the opening screen....is it havok then?
---
They took the money pre-buyers game them too. They had sold thousands of units before launch. 
---
I love all things Fallout, but I did my part. I bought a copy. Now it's their turn, because the game still has bugs and feels unfinished.
---
They should extend halloween week for another 7 days or give us Double XP weekend
---
So what you're saying is you want them to work on more convenience items but only if those are going to be free? You obviously do not understand how anything works. All the things they charge for, all the atom shop stuff, the fallout 1st subscription. Those all go to paying for everyone to continue having free dlc after wastelanders. They actually said this before launch but no one paid any sort of attention to it and people are now raging about shit like this. Do you really think the game won't be even worse with everyone having a second tent preventing other people's camps from spawning in and having an extra scrap box to pull inventory from? You're asking for the servers to work harder than they already do and idk if you've noticed but during big events like now the servers already have a hard time.
---
no thats why these are used in pvp fireproof and dense armor mod barely reduces the damage
---
why...are you people still playing this fucking game. Stop acting like this was going to be some sort of surprise
---
the did twice on bulk ammo and meds, iirc they were gonna continue to watch em
---
That it is. Luckily with sneak you can manage to do well but sooner than later something will find you.
---
Making the best items stupidly rare is basically their way of not having to make an end game. 1 in a million chance of a drop means you'll be playing for a long time right? I much prefer the system classic wow has, where you do a tier of content, get all your gear, then help your friends get theirs until the next tier of content comes out. It's more about clearing the content and having fun with friends. What we have is a Diablo 2 esque loot system though, where the best items are stupidly rare, and collecting "wealth" in terms of gear that can be traded is more important. Unfortunately we lack a solid currency system, as it's too easy to farm caps.
---
All workshops present different terrain that can make for varied PvP battles, and thus all are good for PvP.  
---
The only metric I use for deciding whether or not to contest a workshop is the level of the player that owns it.  Over 60 or so and it's game on.
---
Well, from what I see, they might be trying to totally cut off private world and public world experiences, so all private world only changes will not carry on to public worlds.
---
For camp budgets, they might split the camps into 2 camps, 1 in private and 1 in public. 
---
Workshops data can be saved on characters, just like camps.
---
Mods I don't really know, maybe there will be a creation club for fallout 76 as well, but it'd be pretty fuck up if they ask for money for mods when players already paid for private worlds.
---
Just turn ot down like I did. Its in options audio its a slider labeled menu music.
---
I dunno what you're talking about, works fine on my private server.

You got your xbonex connected to a 4k tv don't you? Or at least one that supports the "enhanced graphics" setting in the xbonex, turn it down to output only 1080p. Seems the xbox crash is due to the enhanced graphics setting some tvs allow.
---
Ooh. Nice photo!  Happy Halloween!

Good idea with the rate my luck goes, it's a guaranteed loser!

It got a build planner and show you the food buffs and what you need. You need to learn the recipes for most tho. The build planner is good since this game punish new players if you choose to wide with the special points. Focus on one weapon or atleast one special. Strenght got unarmed, one hand, two hand, shotgun and heavy gunner.
---
Vendor hold 1,4k caps and reset (every 20? hours) so try to get as much as possible.

Go to any trainstation use the pins on the map at the trainstation to mark all trainstations on your map (grey cant travel to them before you get to them).

You only need to ”tag” enemies to get exp and loot (hit them one time, except for queen and maybe other bosses)
---
Quest at the Ferris wheel (North west from Vault 76) called ”Leader of the pack” spawn 3 wolf packs level 10 with one 1 star legendary in each group. Good for first legendary weapon farm. 
---
The place in top North West corner is a super mutant spawn lvl 5 - 10 area bos think its lvl 15.
---
Good exp untill level 15 - 20.
---
Then Grafton Steel lvl 20/25 to maybe 30.
---
Level 25 do event ”Uranium Fever” - blackwater mine East of whitesprings trainstation.
---
No water or food - Reduced Action points (games  stamina) wont kill you only take you down to 1 hp.
---
Getting high levels of radiation can grant you a mutation. (Can only get one mutation on each server) mutations is meta. (All mutations might be good at low level, just skip Empath (take more dmg and teammates take less)
---
Using Radaway &amp;/or Radaway: Diluted remove radiation and have a chance to remove random mutation.
---
Rad-x &amp;/or Rad-x: Diluted suppress mutations.
---
This is some info I just can figure out right now. Feel free to ask questions.
---
I play on PC but have the game on ps4 aswell, but not even installed there atm lol
---
Maybe with mods you're already giving Bethesda money for the server so they don't need you to spend in the atom shop. At least, I hope that's the case.
---
I’m surprised how much traction this troll post got. 
---
FYI, never played 76.
---
Just make some.  Buffout + Digested Goo + Toxic Soot Flower.  If I remember right...
---
Only place that comes to mind for a consistent Psycho spawn is next to the skeleton in the lower level shower room of whitespring golf club.
---
Is the game any better than 6 months ago?
---
thanks
---
i figured it wasnt working. I can literally shoot a 1000 rounds with my handmade and not take any damage at close range, two shots with the laser and im dead
---
Good point. What is a "PvE" workshop is taken, and then the owner goes AFK? Without the PvP aspect, there would be no way to free up this workshop.
---
I’m at max budget in adventure and can’t place anything in private either so I’d say there is no budget increase.
---
Seriously? 
---
Your last post didn't get good reception so you make another one, and once again want to remove more of the PVP options from players? 
---
No.  95% of the game is great for completely pacifist play.  The 5% (maybe not even that much) for the workshops is PVP.  I don't even like PVP, but I don't want to take way the one element that some players like just because you think that there's some huge issue with PVP in this game - which is something you opt into. 
---
You're still going to make workshops first come first serve, and worse, you think that the people who'd be taking them are going to be low level?  No.  
---
And further, you want them to redesign these entire things, that really are working properly, when the easy, and correct answer is - if you don't want to PvP, don't engage in PVP actions.  You don't see games like world of warcraft changing the way their battlegrounds work so that pacifist players can jump into them and do what they want.
---
This game is nothing like WoW or ESO, there is more content in one of the starter zones in WoW than this entire game will have even after wastlander drops. ESO has more content in just the esylwere dlc than this entire game.
---
Not to mention those are MMO's with thousands on a single server playing together, not 8. You could say it is closer to borderlands 3 multiplayer, or even minecraft. Neither of which charge.
---
It’s out but you gotta pay $49.99 to see it, 9.99 to read it... words cost money.
---
Nah I’d tell you to end it and save us all your pathetic whining
---
You should send in bug reports with the fixes attached, or with half the fix attached, for each bug. Tell them you'll work on the bugs, and keep bothering them til they let you xD I see you (I'm guessing it's you) posting bugs with the fixes every once and a while and since you already figured out the bugs, it seems like you're a worthy candidate for employment. You're doing a good job man
---
You are literally the only one whining here.
---
Man I thought it was bad crashing on me as it started and had to load back in but I always made it before time ended
---
You do understand that wastelanders and fallout 1st were going to be launched at the same time but because wastelanders had to be delayed and all the fallout 1st stuff was done they gave that to us early. People would have been less pissed about the whole thing had they launched at the same time but then we would have been waiting till Feb at least for private worlds. None of the stuff in the pack was ever going to be free at all
---
I am a professional data analyst and the two things that are probably most relevant to this are how the numbers are arrived at and then how management will interpret  or use them. In my experience, in analytics work the numbers you provide are typically accurate and truthful in the contexts under which they are calculated. I say this because there are lot of truthful ways to represent data but how they are used and interpreted is often subjective. If they don't like a certain number, they may seek a "reinterpretation" based on additional parameters that can make that data more appealing by being more or less specific. They may have been provided data that was very broad and didn't contain granularity about the conditions under which utility items are purchased. They may arrive at a number of conclusions as to why a number is a certain way and consider that number accurate but have an artistic interpretation of the user processes that created it, ex:
---
Their data may show that a majority of people who buy cheap utility items are also newer players using them to field repairs when they don't have the junk for it. It may be found that a majority of utility purchases are mostly with free atoms. It could also be a majority of players who don't have a long term investment in the game and so have no reason to own permanent cosmetics. I would actually expect that a sizeable portion (if not a majority) of repair/scrap purchases are likely initiated from a crafting bench UI of someone who currently has a broken weapon and no ability to repair it. Having a lot of in-game currency and needing an instant solution that allows you to keep playing uninterrupted is a common trope in a lot of microtransaction games. There are a lot of variables at play.
---
Ultimately, as interesting as it would be to see how they arrived at these conclusions, since we can't see the data and Reddit is a small vocal sliver of the user base (by being posters and commentators here we are already a different and likely more invested demographic since we engage with the game outside the game) we can only speculate. What they said about utility items being the #1 purchased item is likely true but anybody that does data analysis would tell you graphing 2 lines of utility vs. cosmetic is not necessarily an accurate representation of who is actually paying money or why and there's all kinds of ways to produce numbers that are both different yet accurate.
---
Well, their treatment by Bethesda is like an abusive relationship at least to them.
---
&gt;Incorrect, but good discussion
---
Hillarious. [And true, it's an incorrect assumption.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpn0fj/way_to_go_bethesda_create_a_limited_time_event)
---
No one “one shotting” the legendary yet... lol
---
Digested Goo comes from the Pitcher plants in the cranberry bog.  There’s like 8-10 around/in the sundew forest nearest the big bend tunnel east entrance.
---
On PS4 and I've had it crash/stall on me multiple times. I'd guess 50% sounds pretty close.  Most easily repeatable crash: dying just before the end-boss sentry gets killed. If I'm on the respawn timer when it does I cannnnnnot respawn. There's the hit X to respawn, but does not respond...just circles around my dead body mockingly. No rewards, no legendary, I get nothing but an other hour to wait to retry.
---
Why are you guys still playing this game?
---
This game is nothing like WoW there is more content in the goblin starter zone than this entire game has twice over, and that is only 1 of the 10 starting zones. Comparing this game to WoW is like comparing checkers to chess.
---
in the wastelanders trailer near the end the vault has 79 on it in one of the stills, add that in with the one npc wearing a vault jumpsuit.  its not exactly a official confirmation, but enough to speculate and assume its related.
---
im also hoping for a new raid set before end of year, really hoping its that datamined freezing armor
---
Killed a guy last night that had 600lb of junk with junk weight perks on.
---
My mate dropped his tent on the spot and we had it stored in an infinite container in under 10 seconds.
---
You’re blind if you don’t see the advantage we had on that guy, he had absolutely zero chance thanks to blatant Pay to win tactics.
---
Right, it's fun, but I'd still like to earn the rewards... especially when some items have a 10% drop rate or less.
---
The only closest solution I can think of is that Bethesda adding a feature to let players buy off workshops for a limited time, say 2 hours, for more caps. And of course, we should not be able to buy them all off or do it continuously. This could be a cap sink i if the workshops can be made worth the caps.
---
I was realy hopping for them and the tomb stones 😔
---
Still not pay to win, that guy was just an idiot. You guys rushing to stash all the junk is nothing new. Still not pay to win
---
The pay 2 win items you get from the subscription, like indestrucable tent you can drop anywhere for free cover where ever. Unlimited scrap storage...
---
Wow, no wonder.
---
Explosive Energy weapons pretty much ignore fireproof and like effects due to the way the explosive stacks with the regular damage, its broken, has always been broken, and this is one of the reasons they removed these from the game.
---
If it has beam splitter, it will be indeed dangerous even to you. Same thing with explo GPs.
---
&gt;they might be trying to totally cut off private world and public world experiences, so all private world only changes will not carry on to public worlds.
---
Hell, I figured it'd be this way right out of the gate.  That's what all the uproar is about.
---
I tried once and it crashed so I just gave up
---
For crashes I don't know but the reasons for lags can also lie somewhere else as in the game itself. A bad internet connection for example. 
---
I have a really good wifi connection and the event never crashed or even laged more then once for a second or two during the whole event (PS4).
---
I was hoping it would change with Wastelanders but now that that's been delayed they need to change this to literally anything else. The Nuclear Winter screen gives me anxiety.
---
Unfortunately, Bethesda doesn't release info on this kind of stuff until a maximum of 1 week before it drops. Often times, it's same day.
---
I sat almost all day logged in doing mischief night and only crashed once. We even had Scorched Earth happen and went right into Mischief Night. I crashed on the 10th go around of the event. PS4 500 gig.
---
For the data collection
---
Buy more fallout first subscriptions so they have enough funding to get wastelanders finished sometime in the next 10 years
---
Thank you for this non-bitching content.
---
Tell me what is then? Is your definition of pay to win literally paying a set amount for a prompt to come up on screen saying “winner”.
---
That’s not just a jab, tell me your definition of what it is since you say mine is wrong. Offer an alternative, be constructive to the conversation.
---
Had a lamppost in the courtyard start spinning like a helicopter about 10 ft off the ground.
---
now that makes sense, i've  always wondered why they took then out of the game
---
Do you have the damage numbers setting on? I find that gives a bit of lag
---
&gt;Haven't even acknowledged the buggy Halloween event
---
[Incorrect.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dpn0fj/way_to_go_bethesda_create_a_limited_time_event)
---
Not really, people mostly yell about the junk stash. Junk or the junk stash is not unique to private worlds, and I don't think the stash should be private worlds only.
---
I’ve been told by people smarter than me that they don’t exist.  The explosive laser Gatling does exist though. I actually have a legacy laser Gatling
---
Muting emotes only available to 1st subscribers. Someone was gonna say it anyway lol
---
You're happy that the game crashes?
---
Nobody will do them because there too hard and resource consuming so I guess a waste of time.
---
Though because no one will do them I have very little experience with them
---
Haha, I was about to write almost the same thing. Except my threshold is around 80, + - .
---
All you have to do is look at the implantation of fallout 1st now to see how it’s going to play out. You will get an increase in camp budget that will carry over into adventure. Same as the tent, and the scrap box carry over now. Mods will likely have a limitation where you can’t boost your xp, overpower your weapons so that you can continue to transition back and forth from private to adventure. I think one of the main perks of the fallout 1st system that gets overshadowed is the ability to hop back and forth. I don’t think they’re going to change it. The system is designed for the convenience of the subscribers and not the community as a whole
---
Look for someone to to shit with, they can share the Inspirational perk and give you 15% more xp gain. Then run events, roam the wastes killing shit etc.
---
Do every quest, explore everywhere, kill everything.
---
You have to find and make all those things, or get saddled in with someone established who can help you out with that
---
Bless you for this wholesome non-bitching post.
---
well no player responds in game and all my friends dont play anymore
---
Pay to win, in my opinion, would be if they decided to add special, OP weapons or armor that you can only get by being a 1st member, or purchase with atoms. That is pay to win. You've always been able to kill someone who was carrying 600 lbs of junk and go off to stash it, that's not some new thing they added into the game. Being able to stash junk quicker isn't pay to win
---
Probably not happening. They're trying to figure out a way to make people pay to see it lol
---
Good job, sorry it took so long though lol
---
I’m on my knees from your unrelenting intellectual dissecting of me, please stop
---
Btw mate, you "chalked" it up to a bug, not "chopped" it up.  :)
---
First off yes that was originally the plan but with wastelanders being delayed and the subscription stuff already ready they decided to release it on its own.
---
Second all the stuff that those of us who spend money in the game buy, that money goes towards funding the free dlc for the future after wastelanders. I mean I'm totally okay with having to buy dlc down the road, but if you (not you specifically op just anyone reading this) aren't then stop bashing the things that end up costing money because they take money to make in the first place.
---
What's the point? They got your money and they'll get more at some point. one way or another it's happening.
---
I could see private locked characters if mods are adding extremely OP things like auto leveling or scrap or something to make that select character unbalanced. 
---
Different camps could be cool. Just slap a 1st stamp on a blueprint or two and make sure it only works in private and your golden. 
---
Honestly BGSA could make this game a solid gold brick and bug and people would still complain that the brick is too heavy.
---
At $8 per month, I don't think they're making much money on the private games (since they have to pay AWS for the space), so I don't think that's going to be the case at this point.
---
Now, if they decide that *only* 1sters can access private worlds, that might be more relevant.  But I'm not seeing that yet.
---
Additionally, 'mod support' is something you *really* need to parse carefully.  I don't recall exactly what they've said in the past about that (not that it matters much), but I don't recall having heard the word 'free' in association with that subject.
---
My assumptions or guesses...1sters will have access to private worlds.  Private *servers* will cost another $x per month, and depending on what x is, mod support (or a myriad of other things) could be a charge on top of that.  So say...$13 (8 in bulk) per month for 1st, $20 on top of that for a persistent, private server (or less if it's a 'world' and not actual hardware), $5 per month for mod support, $5 per month for expanded base capabilities.  Hell, add $5 per month for up to 12 players, or $10 for 24 players.
---
Countless ways you can monetize this stuff.
---
Get us Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles, and we will talk about Witch Hunting.
---
Not to mention it’s a way more stable area of the map
---
Keep in mind when making and placing such blueprints that you'll need to place the stairs before you can place the 2nd floor.
---
Gilded clock, fireman helmet, ranger hats, clean space helmets x2, vamp vault-boy x2, and a bleep-load of pumpkin/rack plans and resort lamp plans.
---
Ha
---
This is why I can't sell any salt on my vendor, you're giving it away for free on Reddit!
---
You gotta find resources OP. Find a low level town to clear out enemies in and then loot the place. Should find some canned food easily, maybe switch to melee to conserve ammo.
---
 For food you can take out critters to cook the meat, collect water from ponds to boil, meds etc. Pick up junk to fill up your stash box while you're at it, you'll need junk later. 
---
If you go to Flatwoods and explore, you should find some armor around the town, or you can craft your own weapons and armor. Also follow the quests, they'll also provide rewards, and events give good loot for early game too
---
Nobody else wanted a mug with the logo for this shitty game on it
---
Hope it gets better for you bud. This is a really odd sword to jump on.
---
I want the coffins!
---
I never knew Todd Howard has a cousin.
---
I believe it's related to chems and food wearing off after giving you a boost to max HP. If you're at max health when such an effect wears off, the game has to reduce your hp when the max is reduced. I think it does so by assessing just enough damage to lower your hp to the new maximum. You wouldn't notice the hit becausr your health is still maxed out, but you still get the noise and visual effects from the damage.
---
Lol people still play this game?!
---
Technically nuking the event while it's going is actually against the code of conduct that you agree to when playing the game. It actually stated that anything that disturbs another's enjoyment of the game brought on purposefully by another player isn't allowed
---
Does it get tiring pretending to me a victim every day?
---
Guarantee there are some people under NDA for something’s. Unlikely that BGSA/BGS doesn’t have them out and on people.
---
I don't think this is going to happen. Same thing happened with liberty prime, people wanted to mute it but ofcourse that didn't happen.
---
Considering how many people affected; it's the servers. All the friends I play with on 76 DC from a good 20% of the events.
---
Running an xbonex with enhanced graphics enabled right? Turn enhanced gfx off and run it at 1080p or 720p.
---
Halloween is their only true safe time when they can walk among the people and collect potion ingredients without risk of being burned alive
---
Nah NAH, that’s not pay to win! You see anyone can farm for a full set of combat armor with unyielding, action point refresh speed, and sentinel and anyone can farm for a Bloodied explosive fixer. So it’s not pay to win for fallout first members to get that stuff free right??
---
Do you get my point man? That’s your logic right there.
---
The literal definition of pay to win by Wikipedia is “when a player can gain any gameplay advantage over his non-paying peers”
---
Being able to store infinite resources over other players is by definition pay to win. It just is. That’s the definition of it, the literal definition. What more do you need to get it? Read the definition yourself! Don’t just downvote everyone you disagree with, don’t just feel bad about shitty things you do, BE BETTER THAN THAT. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play#Pay-to-win
---
Most of the people angry aren't even a part of the f76 community lol
---
Should have been $5/month, $40/year.
---
That $5 should have included:
---
- The forward camp.
---
- $5 worth of Atoms. ($60 worth of atoms for the $40/year option.)
---
- Exclusive cosmetics.
---
- Discounts in the Atom shop.
---
Unlimited scrap storage should have been added to the base game.  'Private' servers should have been added to the base game.  The refrigerator and scrap bot should also have been added to the base game.
---
Literally no one would have complained.
---
...yeah we're gonna agree to disagree cause you're making no sense and just sound fuckin stupid. It's not pay to win, y'all can stop crying about it now
---
I know you're trying to be compassionate, but these posts don't help. Honestly people, regardless if its true, will accuse you of being a shill account, and nothing will be gained.
---
Dude, nice.
---
It's an unconfirmed Reddit post that, through the media's game of Chinese Whispers, has snowballed into us allegedly being in the middle of the Bolshevik uprising.
---
In reality, the post was just a guy talking about how he griefed people he saw with the Fallout 1st player icon.
---
Shill is the new Synth, I guess?
---
What if I'm a Syn.. Shill, how would I ever know the difference?
---
Am I just a fan, or am I getting paid to do PR?
---
Maybe, just maybe, they performed a mind wipe on us, so they don't have to pay us, and we don't remember anything about being a shill?
---
What platform do you play on
---
It's reported to have been fixed in the hot fix that was performed.
---
We had to walk because someone blew up our cars!
---
The Fallout map is HUGE and densely packed. You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Nuke Todd 😤
---
How do you generally play any Fallout game? Explore, loot, craft. Git Gud. Become strong. Learn the meta builds and why they are powerful. Follow one or make your own based on what is strong.
---
Try playing early in the morning.  I haven't crashed once in the early AM.  LOL.  Seriously, when I play prime time 6 pm to 9 pm I've crashed 50% of the time.
---
You have to pay extra if you don't want your game to crash.
---
only if the buttons can be programmed with Ra-Fi technology, allowing you to connect the devices through walls and without wires.
---
I wish it was just about the scrap box and maybe the survival tent. There's also an uproar because of the subscription itself.
---
If you see something that looks like it doesn’t want to cuddle, kill it. Loot it and repeat. Loot houses and building for general supplies. If you low level hang in the greenlands to get your bearings. 
---
Scrap your junk you find and use that to make weapons and armour until you find better gear. 
---
Wood and water will be your best source of survival. 
---
If nothing else look up a recent starter guide on YouTube for a crash course. 
---
Check out Nukes and dragons to plan out a build or ask for  suggestions for one.
---
And?
---
ROFL, Have you even played the goblin starting zone in WoW? You think this map is densely packed? That is adorable: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWg-JPI57PA
---
What platform?
---
You responded 8 seconds after I sent that. I counted, I actually counted. You didn’t have time to read it and you had to have had that typed up and ready. You are either a bot or you are so in denial that you push everyone away. 
---
Congratulations either way friend, I really hope you are a bot, because anyone with your argumentative mentality is going to have serious relationship problems.
---
Yep exactly
---
Which platform? Public or private server?
---
I’ve noticed that public (adventure) do have several minute of server lagg or heavy rubber banding. I can really feel the frustation, I went tru the same at the release of raids. It’s bs that they keep releasing stuff with no standard. 
---
"We are actively engaging in several measures to make sure that the builds that are delivered to you are the highest quality" -Jeff Gardiner
---
It's not a game you -win-, tho. Unless you mean the raid, but the tent doesn't help you with that. And carrying capacity is something most games make you pay extra for, like Freemium MMOs like SWTOR.
---
Psh, do I mind?? Of course man, id greatly appreciate it.
---
Easiest answer is to play Fallout 4, the game is way more stable and the story is more interesting.
---
Meh. Hike your own hike and allow others to do the same.
---
Dude asked a question and I provided an answer.
---
And what? I'm suggesting you not make posts like this because you're hurting your own cause.
---
You can win in PvP encounters and having an indestrucible cover you can drop anywhere like it is NW is a major advantage.
---
Name checks out
---
I'm done with this game.  I tried to enjoy it, but since Borderlands 3 came out, I haven't even played it once.  Now with this subscription, I'm out.  Glad I only wasted 15 bucks on the game.
---
How do you figure?
---
How did you get the weapon?
---
The answers you seek can be found. For 13.99/month or 99.99/year depending on your geographical region.
---
Better in some areas. 
---
Worse in others.
---
6 crashes in 2 events. Total of 5 attempts, 1 completion. Not fucking cool
---
Same here man, I'll be on at about 6PM Eastern. No rush though, I appreciate the help.
---
Well, the subscription really should not exist until the game is fixed, but now here it is and the scrap  stash is the thing people hate the most.
---
Waving Santa and Vault Bunyan statue
---
Yeah, yeah, whatever asshat
---
I’d delete that character and start over.
---
That depends, how much money ya got?
---
I've done the event 10-12 times and only lagged out once, and was able to immediately get back in. I'm also on onex- just corroborating what you're saying. Also, I only have lag when all the cars are exploding. I'm sad to see folks are having problems cause  I think the event is awesome and the cosmetic awards are just the kinda stuff I like.
---
Something similar happened to me 2 days ago while using the hazmat suit. I lost my weightless left arm and leg pieces. Didnt access my pip boy in between equipping and unequipping the suit, but when I went to put my armor back on both left pieces were gone. Since I changed in the exact same spot both times, and I walked a total of 10 feet, and I didnt see a paper bag anywhere, I'm pretty certain they weren't dropped. That bug cost me 6k caps this time. This was not the first time I've had items disappear from my inventory.
---
I don't work for a company. I work for an individual. I especially support independent developers if they make games I play. I bought Pillars of Eternity and enjoyed the story a lot. But you have to understand that Obsidian was bought out by Microsoft now. Have you ever heard of Microsoft "giving a fuck" about their customers? In fact if you Google "Microsoft doesn't give a fuck about its customers, you get a lot of links describing just that
---
This game is shit right now. I am 0/3 today. I keep crashing out, not being able to return in time. It is so fucking frustrating. 1/3 today, 4/8 yesterday. 
---
I've got no advice on how not to crash. I'm on xb1, btw.
---
Or you're just a stupid asshole, there's that, too. Anyways. Agree to disagree, cause I'm gonna forever call y'all idiots wrong. Still not pay to win so cut the crying about it
---
I can guarantee you that there was no 'solution' for the inventory/scrap space.  It was simply an artificial limit on our accounts that was set.  The paywall simply grants a P2W feature and removes that limit by giving the subscribers a specific container to use.
---
Nice Bethesda, nice.
---
I was really looking forward to trying it tonight (first break from the outer worlds!) But explosions always make it crash for me so now idk if it's even worth trying. I'm giving this game so many chances and trying so hard to enjoy it!
---
Wait, the xp resets each day
---
Fair enough, I was wrong. Didn’t mean to insult you, more of a comment on the state of this sub rather than you.
---
Ah that’s what I was hoping! Thanks for the tip, is that definite?
---
Public on Xbox. I have looked past all the previous bugs, but for some reason this one sent me over the edge.
---
Because right now, its a popular argument that Bethesda are using PR accounts to make posts exactly like this, sympathizing with Bethesda/zenimax.  The reality is that Reddit has a very small, specific part of the player base, who tend to be more interested in being angry at the game rather than actually play it.  
---
Honestly I don't really agree with your post at all, but the sentiment behind it (Fallout 1st not being the end of the goddamn world) I do. So from that stance, I'm saying its probably better just to let all this blow over rather than trying to tell a bunch of angry keyboard warriors that maybe their righteous anger might not be entirely justified.   
---
Tl;Dnr: Same team, lets not feed the trolls.
---
I normally don't get mad over this game because it's just a game and I don't care that much but when it takes for fucking ever to load into the damn thing and then you crash just before you get your rewards or before you can pick up the legendary, it's fucking bullshit.
---
And the rewards aren't even fucking worth it.
---
Do they stress test shit before they put it out or do they just say here you go! And hope for the best? Like goddamn.
---
I only get a black screen when I try to load in at whitespring around full hour aka when the event starts. Really freaking annoying
---
Candidates as well!
---
I'm here for that but the downvote crew is not
---
Whatever.
---
I did not know that thank you
---
I was thinking the same thing. If my house wasn’t so small I’d set up a nice table and give out nuka cola, grenades and candy.
---
You are right though, this is a missed opportunity.
---
Don't shoot the robots or the cars if robots are nearby. Robots only aggro on the person/people damaging them. The last 2 events I've managed to actually complete, I've only shot ghouls (except end boss). Robots just skip me completely.  :)
---
wastelanders isn't coming. Not the game 2.0 this sub is building it up as. It's gonna be it's own PR disaster when it's a 45 minute questline and some noninteractable human models and like, one repeatable choose your own adventure dialog tree with a 17 cap reward or something.
---
They just need to make workshops worth battling over and controlling.  Honestly none of them are really worth the effort of fighting over.....unless you like pvp.  
---
They need to make the workshop pvp more organic by having them produce useful items or more items.  I think a little cool down in between "battles" would be fine so the winner can actually harvest the materials earned rather than battling continuously.
---
There are tons of things you could get from workshops that would be worth fighting over including:
---
\-ballistic fiber
---
\-screws, springs, gears
---
\-silver, gold (devs need to boost the value on these two items)
---
\-finished weapons (for scrapping)
---
\-chems
---
\-canned food/dog food
---
\-nuka cola
---
\-ammo (ammo factory needs boosted production)
---
The other thing they need to do is boost production on the other materials gathered at workshops.  Whether it's wood, lead, acid, etc.  It needs to be a lot more than you currently get.   Right now you can scavenge all of these items faster than the time it takes to mess with a workshop.
---
Yeah I play on Xbox so for me it’s just the right analog stick. Glad you were able to find out!
---
It isn’t real. As far as I know someone posted the idea here and then some clickbait websites blew it out of proportion.
---
Appreciate the vote of confidence
---
Did it quite a few times last night, no real lag or crashes. Must depend how many turn up maybe but was 10 or so.
---
I hide at the last spot down the stairs. works flawlessly. Sorry i had to do this cause i crash 7/10 times.
---
Done the event a dozen times, not 1 crash... Clean the vents and heatsinks on your consoles/pc's, maybe replace thermal paste if needed.
---
Around the pumpkin house top right of the map there's loads.
---
Do you know the Pumpkin House
---
The Pumpkin House
---
In the Savage Divide?
---
The 3 to 5 minute reload is unusual also. I think there is something odd going on at the event. Likely the huge amount of information the game needs to reload before logging you back in. Most times when I get back in,  players and enemies are invisible and half the world hasn't rendered
---
Oh your enclave as well lol. Whats ur ign? I'll come hunting
---
Astroturfers have a vested interest in making things appear worse than they are, OP. And what I mean by astroturfer is people who don't play the game and want to turn this into a controversy to "make a statement" to the gaming community that "we don't want microtransactions" lol
---
My house is too big saddly. I don't even like the pumpkins we got because they don't light up :( I've been doing door to door where people are at and dropping some candy and what not and going to the next house. Some people just stared at it and left. Guess they didn't get the spirit of Halloween
---
There's a trailer camp to the west of the pumpkin house. They're next to the white fences over there
---
Sweeeet 🤩
---
Yep....havnt played 76 since aug... I dont miss it.
---
Ive only attempted it three times and it crashed on me twice.  Each time trying to respawn after dying. 
---
PSA: And please for the love of the lord, it’s a public event, don’t kill the legendary boss in 2 seconds before anyone else gets a shot in!!!!!
---
This could fundamentally change camp building for the better.  Great idea, earned the upvote.  This idea needs more visibility.
---
There are plenty of accounts that do the same thing but in a negative light. Trying to determine the validity of a post results in no valuable result. Might as well just shut down the subbreddit to quiet the useless noise.
---
I have no interest in your pork sword
---
I haven’t played since January. But getting rid of the toxic players that won’t buy anything anyway and feeing up server space isn’t going to hurt their cost to operate any
---
Doesn't matter cause you're on PC and I'm on Xbox. Wouldn't give it to you anyways 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
A player had a floating base on one of the cliffs near WSprings, with hidden missing floor tiles. A player had been following me around trying to initiate PVP for awhile, so I fast traveled to the trap base, went to the top and stood on the other side of a missing piece (owner was using plants and different tiles to camo the gap). PVPer followed, dropped through the gap and splatted about 500 ft down.  :)
---
Yeah I get you no worries didnt mean to make it seem that way, the sub is very toxic atm so I get it.
---
that's going to be a tight fit in an outhouse...
---
Okay cheers. What if the blueprint for the 2nd floor includes the stairs? I'm pretty sure I did it this way when trying out builds for NW. And just snapped the stairs onto the first floor.
---
If you dont have frog legs then your chances of winning are like 1%
---
No surprise there, my advise. Shut up about subjects u know nothing about.
---
You’d really hate me lobbing nuke grenades everywhere and firing off my missile launcher.
---
Probably not. I’ve been a fallout fan since the first one came out and never bought a Bethesda one for more than $20GOTY version before this one. I preordered this one and learned my lesson, back to patient gamer mode on fallouts
---
I haven’t even messed with the jack o lanterns yet. A lot of people are nervous lately with the attacks on 1st members. (Not that they are harmful) 
---
I use the follow me and gift emotes until they get the hint. Or even just msg them I have stuff.
---
Cursing, belittling and getting mad isn’t winning the argument, most people like you curse and get mad more when they know they’re losing the argument. 
---
If Reddit had a pay to win an argument feature we both know you’d of used it already, cause you’ve yet to even make your first point. When you’re done with your tantrum I’m ready to have a real argument with valid points and criticisms from BOTH sides.  
---
Yelling👏cursing👏and👏belittling👏isn’t👏an👏argument
---
Try and get decent but less popular starting points (ye this can vary for each run). Stay at the edge of the circle, try to move so you get inside the new just in time. This is tips for you, which I assume, are going solo. Don’t enter combat unless you got no choice, try and kill npcs with melee weapon so you dont let everybody know your position. If your team rush to their deaths, fuck em. 😄
---
Most fun is ofc with a team with mics. This method I’m telling you is boring but should help you get a bit further. I won like this and often ends at top 5. Guess next worse thing to hackers are organized teams.
---
It's a masochistic experiment. I'm about to log on and keep trying.. lol 🥴
---
find a nice hole. 
---
Hide.
---
Win.
---
I’ve noticed this. I equipped grenadier hoping to spam them down for a moment. Works kinda at least for me. I’m 8/10 in tickets to get it.
---
People wouldn't have cared that much if the game had more content, and content that worked correctly.  I love Fallout 76 but I just don't really see the point of Fallout 1st right now.  I enjoy the player interaction so the private server thing the way it is right now seems awfully lonely.  Most of the atom shop stuff isn't very appealing to me either.  I just don't see the point right now.
---
 Both run beautifully on my nice private server
---
you can try switching display setting to 720p, i heard that helps
---
yeah you can

---
I think that's also when I've been freezing up. I'm pretty sure it's when like 4 or more cars blow up at the same time.
---
Bethesda knew that... they are giving the poor people a reason to waste more money on the game.... keep falling for it.
---
You can win without it, and you can win with it.... Hell you can beat Fallout 76 with nothing but a rad suit and a flamethrower. Will it take a long time to do it? yes, but it can be done. Pay 2 win in this case is called time saving, they bog down game mechanics so  that it's frustrating enough to consider buying them.....  
---
The issue is, in order to **force consumers to buy non-cosmetic dlc**.... They nerfed the perk cards that compete with the kits and firdge. Lets not forget **Pete Hines** said there would be no paid non-cosmetic DLC, that was a factor when I bought this game. So now **All quality of life DLC** will be behind a paywall. It means they will not give us **ANY or VERY LITTLE** quality of life content for the people who bought the game believing his words.  
---
As consumers we are not responsible for poor budget planning, poor marketing or Bad PR on behalf of the company. If they want me to be concerned about their profits..... it's simple, produce a product that's worth buying and being excited about. It be done while maintaining their word on the product.
---
If you're on xbox I've got a camp right next to it and can show you where they all grow!

Hope so

South of Pumpkin House near the Fissure site. There's a couple of patches around what looks like a little Halloween festival.
---
Could you have at least posted a picture with the coffee cup not in the package
---
I agree, being a dick is not excuse. But criticise something is not being a dick (if you have respect). Influencing on this criticism for financial purposes apart from being deplorable is illegal. You just have to check the profiles of some of the redditors of this thread yo realize how fucked up Bethesda is and how the fallout community is going to sink because all of this bullsh*t.
---
 Make sure you have food, meds, ammo, guns and armour. Its kinda what the game is about really. Housekeeping. ;)
---
This is the difference between thinking and reacting.
---
No, he says read carefully because he's trying to continue a conversation on whether or not they delivered out of you. Your original statement was that "whether you like it or not they delivered," while his closing statement was "they did not deliver."
---
The customers at the burger joint I'm in are now looking at me quizzically as I'm spewing tea across my table. :)
---
I know the safest routes to get you in and out! Green thumb perk works as well. There is also a backwoodsman that increases your harvest yield!
---
It's really dumb that we can't get most rewards until after Halloween
---
Dont wanna be that guy but if you have 1st membership you can play on private world which is stable and serverchop that world to farm that event
---
If it’s that hard for you to play this game without basic repair kits, then maybe it’s time to find a new hobby...
---
Yeah have fun with that. I killed myself 2 out of the first 3 shots I fired out if my BE laser rifle. Lol. Even my VE Gatling Plasma I kill myself more often than I kill any enemies.
---
Just try not to use them on any enemy that tries to move closer to you at all and you should be fine. Haha.
---
wait until the next reward unlocks at 8pm EST(ish) the exp should carry over, dont complete the most current reward until skeleton is open.
---
someone on my bl said exp will carry over, im gonna confirm for myself tonight
---
its cause suddenly people everywhere got a voice and think cause they have one and its online they can say anything without it snapping back horribly on them
---
I have a camp set up nearby with a spike trap launchpad for my jetpack PA, that's pointed right at the pavilion!  And I'm using bird bones. It's SO fun to drop in from super high up and jetpack back down the last 20 feet or so!  I WISH space-x landing leg mods were a real thing...!
---
This is the best answer.
---
Suprising
---
Ahh I see.... you either didn't read the reply.... or you are trying to deflect the points made..... very suspicious. Hail Bethesda.
---
Thanks I’ll be sure to message you on here tomorrow to see if you were right if that’s ok
---
make each other's houses hackable
---
Paranoid much?
---

build a CAMP, plant stuff, sell stuff visit other CAMPs
---
Bethesda- playing solo in private servers can help alleviate that.
---
I team for the most part only once or twice have I solo ran. I will forsake my team if their combined IQ and perception is lower than Moon temp. 
---
My biggest problem is aiming. I can but I just can never get hits to land. Even on stationary people. For some reason I can aim good with auto weapons but semi auto I can’t even hit the side of a house from nose distance.
---
I'd put it at a good 5 not quite a 6. The vault raids could be better the spawn rate was consistent. 
---
When 4 Manning a raid not enough enemies and when 2 Manning never ending spawns? 
---
Rewards are not bad but nothing you desperately need either. I'm use to wow where raids offered top tier rewards for players. And inorder to even try a top tier raid you need the top tier rewards from it or other raids.
---
no happy that they still received the rewards despite the crash. If it crashed at the beginning then by the time you get back in the event is over and you don't get any reward.
---
i should be able to update in a few hours when i get home, i didnt finish yesterdays 10mm yet (im at like 450/750) so i should trigger the minigun paints)
---
Ooooo you are getting defensive. Normal people would have just brushed my comment aside or addressed the point of Pete Hines. Not you.... you're trying to discredit my point by trying to say it's a conspiracy....hmmm. how is the zenimax offices? I hear it's very scenic.
---
Because half of a shill’s posts are going to be on NSFW porn Reddits...
---
Nuke mines. Is that glitch still around?
---
Dude, face it, you suck as a gamer.
---
Thanks for the info dude!
---
Feeling 'disrespected' would indicate you are owed something in the first place.
---
Literally 5 minutes into church and chill
---
That doesn't mean anything. A shill account is designed to look normal while boosting the PR of said company. the fact you had to point out your post history is alarming.
---
maybe just maybe they’re doing some hold on releasing items to cut back on people buying it getting the goods then canceling right after... i’ve heard a few people did it just to get the outfit
---
Good, you deserve it.
---
They’re trying to see if we’re cycloptaths I guess
---
Died getting a handjob in church.
---
Unsure what glitch you're referring to, but people can toss out nuke mines and still "kill" other players with the radiation
---
Ye you want auto weapons for dps and also bigger hit chance. Im not good at this but when Ive played most of the time (depending on the spawn point 😄) Ive done decent. I just focus on staying alive and go all in at the end.
---
I’ve had to many a time. Sadly it doesn’t work that. More often I’ve had to landmine the bush or location in hopes to run.
---
I hope this helps you. What i do is I hide down the stairs at the last spot of the event. 
---
Seems to work great cause im bit far out from all the action. I have no choice cause I crash all the time with all those explosions.
---
Gotta be one of the only people still playing man hahahaha
---
The best part is that by the time they fix it the event will be over.
---
Damn, caught me!  But really, you suck suck as a gamer.
---
My winning weapons seem to be the sub machine and assault rifle. Everything else is just shooting blanks.
---
How many who have had trouble with it crashing repeatedly are on a console and how many are running the stock 5400rpm internal HDD? The game seems to run a lot better on our one xbox that has the game on a USB SSD. Same was true with FO4.
---
Thank you for your report about this! We've looked into it and found that some of these reward plan names are incorrect in languages other than English and we are investigating a fix for a future update.

I don't think you should share your ticket number publicly. But you should make a new one and pester Bethesda again. Also message their ad up port team on Twitter. And someone could tg the community managers in this Reddit.
---
Gatling gun was nice aswell unless they nerfed it?
---
Reported for shilling. Reported for harassment. Reported for NSFW history.

You cannot grasp the truth behind the actual conspiracy, shill. Rest assured, the powers-that-be will not stand for this.

Yeah, you can do the event twice per hour if you can complete it fast enough in adventure mode then switch over tongue private world. I'm crossing my fingers for that pirate outfit.
---
Genuine question, are you braindead?
---
Personal attack with no basis.... cool. btw My youtube video tutorials have been popular... sooooo you're just stabbing at the wind. It's okay I'm sure you'll get a raise for this.
---
No, since 90% of the rewards it gives you are broken it really wouldn't be worth wasting money
---
Thank you team :)
---
That's a trip, seems like everyone has a similar story lol
---
So am I going to jail or something?
---
That's what im saying!!
---
That would be utterly ridiculous. "hey sign up, pay us but haha you can now randomly wait for your stuff."  I wanted the private server so I could grind my character up. I haven't played for months.
---
The sub is split.  I have first and I enjoy it, I got it primarily for the private world that was announced as a service last October. Everything else was just a bonus.  
---
You'll have a lot of people just saying no or telling you your enabling Bethesda.  
---
Long story short, the answer given won't be objective, it's subjective.  So really, if you're hesitant, I'd say don't get it unless you feel confident you'll enjoy the perks.  You could, if you really wanted, try one month and see if you enjoy it enough.  If nothing else you get to try the service and you get atoms and an outfit to try it out. 
---
But really I don't see you getting much help since you'll get answers on both side.
---
Why such low rewards for kills? Just up that number and it would be more reasonable to lock things behind a higher tier. As is, you really do gain from not engaging with people, IMHO that is bass-ackwards for a BR.
---
There should be about 10-12 pumpkins next to the Morgantown train station towards the airport. I always pick those up and go straight to Pumpkin House for the basic Daily mission.
---
Ah, thanks man!
---
Wait, My mistake.  I thought that Redditors could handle counter points.  Stupid me, thinking logically...
---
Not even gonna down vote you for that because I actually do feel like a fool.
---
I guess if it doesn't do alot of harm its something that can be ignored
---
I don't think it's worth supporting at this price. It's not really providing much content compared to services with similar price like PS now or xbox gamepass
---
I bought a month. It's worth it for the outfit, emotes and atoms. 
---
I already turned off the auto-renew, though, and don't plan on continuing after this month. We'll see how much I miss it.
---
In the mean time it is nice to be able to grab all the lead in my private world and dump it into the junk stash, though.
---
I don’t care who buys it and who doesn’t. I got the game for a single figure sum in the hopes it may get better. I would say that anyone who does subscribe has to shoulder some of the responsibility for any future consequences of supporting this experimental method of  game monetisation.
---

Worse. You're going to BlizzCon.
---
Dude, you said that you needed repair kits to win, so you can’t be THAT good.

do what makes you happy, and f@#$ the rest. if you can comfortably afford the cash lay out, why wouldn't you buy it. it's just a game.
---

---
I had to find a super mutant cauldron for my witch photo shoot.
---
it has pvp in the title, therefor people r going to mass down vote it. love this community
---
I'm not even paying mind to them. I, personally, haven't seen any class warfare. The ones with fallout first have actually been nice to me, and I haven't seen anyone chasing them and all. I think it was just a small case of it happening. If it ever happens, just block for a session. But the ones from the event don't light up or anything. I was excited to get them, as I've seen the atom shop ones around and liked them, and just.. my area is a dark cultist area with a band stage, so it's pretty dark. And you just cant see them. I feel like a third world country getting the crappy stuff.
---
That's up to you OP. No one is gonna convince you to get it, only try to convince you *not* to get it. Those who have it don't care, but those who don't have it do care. Personally I found it worth it just for the atoms and dance emotes. I don't wear the NCR duster, don't stay on my private server for long, and don't put down the tent *or* farm junk enough to put in my box

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!  Those fans are REALLY creepy!

It's Reddit. The only "points" that matter are Karma points. All hail Karma, Karma is God.

So you didn't read the post. This is why you are called a shill.   
---
Please quote me where I said I used repair kits.
---
Stubbing your toe is still painful lol let's hope the moth man isn't stalking
---
Man I wish I had waited a bit more for the x. I've been sneaking alongside jes3r while looking at the ground to not crash
---
It was Bethesda officially responding, though right? Not just the community managers.
---
People have been saying that there are people on the Fallout 76 sub reddit, specifically employed by Bethesda to promote Fallout 76. I doubt it on the whole, but I really think someone's paying you because no one is as stupid as you on their own. If you actually have Fallout First then some guy at Bethesda must be telling you what the words Lumpenproletariat, Bourgeoisie and Comrade mean.
---
So I was on a dead world last night. Almost like my own private server without paying haha! Got on to try the event and what not. Only other person in my world was my fiancé. I crashed twice straight back to Xbox dashboard in the span of three hours. One of the times was during an event I was trying to solo but I have no actual proof why I crashed.
---
Dude, it’s okay.  I’ve watched plenty of YouTube videos made by people who suck.
---
Neither. Its Bethesda's own "Creation engine" which was used for fo4, skyrim and 76. The engine is based on the Gamebyro engine that was used for morrowind, fo3, oblivion and fo nv, as well as several other non bethesda titles
---
Having read it, you're not far off.

"Work well"
---
Heh.

No crashes on PS4 for me done it about 5 times

I did hit them up on Twitter. They said my ticket was in the right place and waiting for the next agent. I also heard making new ticket's or adding to the current ticket puts you at the bottom of the Que. Probably will start another one later if I don't hear back and I removed my ticket from above. Thanks for the advise though.
---
If you just want the rewards then Netflix is your best option. Find a nice bush to hide in and take off all your clothes for nude camo. Wait for your death and do it all again. AFK while watching TV is my tactic for these Halloween reward set. If you want to reach level 100 or something you will probably need more advanced advice than this.
---
Please quote me where I said I use repair kits.
---
Evidence for this happening? Deleted from where? Here or their own forums?
---
I have to ask...how? I’m honestly not trying to trash talk I just don’t understand the logistics of having three high level characters. I’ve been playing the same character since day 1 and I’m level 141. Of course, I spend a lot of time just messing around accomplishing nothing. Do you spend most of your time grinding for max XP? High intelligence characters?
---
Three days in, I still haven't managed to finish it. Either I lag out while loading, or the game crashes hard enough to need a full reboot. Boo.
---
Yeah, I've completed it 8 times so far on PS4 (standard) and zero crashes. Laggy as fuck, but I can live with that
---
This could explain several lost peices of armor for my toons. I am in and out of PA alot(lucky hole, nuke zones, ect.)  So hurtful to lose those hard to get peices( for me anything I want in a right arm or leg is super rare, grrr)
---
You do realize that instead of making a post whining about how you can't place things under stairs... you could have just asked how to place things under stairs...
---
Making a shit post like this is just going to attract more people whining about how much the game sucks and lower the odds of someone actually helping you with what you're trying to do.
---
She's a witch!
---
Honestly, if the event spawned like the Faschnaut  Parade did then it wouldn't  be nearly as irritating. This once an hour crap is what annoys me the most, let me actually play the new content Bethesda.
---
Go for it. It’s worth it in the long haul. The private/solo farming doesn’t make that much of a difference. Aure you get to do events and at your pace but you can do that in public in the right set up. 
---
The scrap box is ok. You still need to find stuff to fill it. Imo I moved all my scrap into it and saved 200? Pounds. Still need to replace my used scrap. And yes the collectron helps add into it but it’s nowhere near enough. 
---
The ranger out is cool but doesn’t do anything but make you 1% cooler. 
---
The tent nice. But doesn’t replace the need to deal camps. Still need to repair and whatnot. 
---
And the attacks on first members is pointless. Their words aren’t going to make you quit or chargeback. It’s your money do with it what you please. 
---
As for the atoms you get. It’s nice. But you’ll either pop them at once or save them. 
---
I’d say get a month and try and if you don’t like it don’t re-up again or keep buying it. In the end of you love playing 76 it’s worth it. If not you aren’t hurting yourself if you don’t.
---
You straight up said that they nerfed the game to make it only winnable with repair kits.  I haven’t had a problem without them and I totally suck, so that must mean that you suck worse than me.
---
Ye
---
But it’s an Xbox account
---
 Quote me where I said they made it only winnable with repair kits.
---
A microtransaction shop should only contain cosmetics. Even more so if you paid $60.
---
Wow, took them this long to essentially same the same thing as last week?
---
I try not to use it. It’s cool but with all the bunny hoppers it’s just dead weight to me.
---
I'm n PV
---
Right?
---
If you are on console have you tried safe mode system file restore? it doesn't fix everything but seems to help with crashes to a degree
---
Ye that might be, just heard about the jumpers. Havnt played in a long time.
---
Xbox sadly. But yeah just check for recent starter guide on YouTube for basics.
---
Knowing Bethesda, it's likely water-soluble and made out of asbestos....
---
I run the SBQ religiously and farm legendaries. The highest level character collected most early running endless Whitespring nukes when the xp was ridiculous
---
Can't you add Moldy Food or Toxic Goo to the bowl?
---
Haven't placed it yet, so don't know what it can hold.
---
:(
---
No thanks, I'm in recovery :D
---
hahahaha shut up loser
---
Aye I assume it'll still be ticking down to be activated at the pavilion yeah?
---
Too boring. If I wanted to play afk arena I’d load it up on my phone. I need to at least try.
---
Cheesy rewards? I’m with you brotha. Last night I had two disconnects and the two times I was able to make it to the rewards phase I received pastor vestments. Both outfits were pastor vestments...
---
I think they forgot to mention everyone's favorite part of patch 14.
---
Nice, you get upvotes and i get downvoted for agreeing....
---
Lol, yup
---
Too crowded and certainly laggy.
---
I always play as a Sith lol
---
Fine with that.  I'm playing the Outerworlds on game pass and since I'm a first time sub I only paid $1.
---
2 and 7.  
---
I barely touch'em anymore, but I did by and large enjoy them. At this point, I'm just doing other things/trying to find things like good Exterminator weapons and such to take the edge off.  
---
That I'm also doing the raids alone doesn't make things any easier for me.
---
Ah.. just late.
---
So, just recapping the latest patch and Mischief Week, pretty lackluster. It would be nice to get more clarification on the NW rewards from the horses-mouth. You can't unlock everything at once, in fact players are better to wait until the end to unlock that one thing they're aiming for.
---
“Pay 2 win in this case is called time saving, they bog down game mechanics so  that it's frustrating enough to consider buying them....”
---
“They nerfed the perk cards that compete with the kits and firdge. Lets not forget Pete Hines said there would be no paid non-cosmetic DLC, that was a factor when I bought this game.“
---
See, you actually as a gamer.
---
A majority of the replies have been people agreeing with the point I made and offering possible solutions. And my post isn’t whining, it states a fact, “building is worse”, and then gave evidence to support it as personal experience 
---
You are one of the few replies not offering a possible solutions and whining, albeit not about how “the game sucks”
---
Yeah play fo76 on ps4 lol, I've done loads of mischief nights and not once has it crashed
---
It’s a buzz kill. I’m sure there is way to hard counter them but I’m not going to devote time to that.
---
That makes sense. I’ve launched only one nuke and very seldom go into Nuke zones.
---
So to get some clarification, we have several days after the final unlock to earn 140000 XP?
---
You forgot the link

---
It says on the atom shop review you can put food in it . At first we thought you could add food , but only the candy pops up if you wanna transfer .  
---
Gonna have a look at it again this evening
---
Hard to find nowadays anywhere...
---
Your money and no one should tell you what you can and can’t do regardless of any controversial issues they think is going on. 
---
I have it and I play with my son and friends. It was nice having a group that didn’t one shot a legendary... or after we launched a nuke before Halloween event at WS when someone saw a legendary we all got a shot on it most the time. 
---
No worries if players going in and out of world which honestly that alone I think makes the server stressed and no issues with 8 players. 
---
I haven’t placed the scrap box or tent... not exactly a priority for me or need.
---
What a great recap of the patch notes. This is pretty close to the least they could do
---
:((
---
You got it! What build are you planning? That way I can sort out some decent weapons and maybe armor for you
---
Well that's totally useless :(
---
Thanks for posting it at least.
---
Havent had it crash on a gen 1 xbox 1, slow as all hell, but no crashing
---
And Ive done it more than 10 times
---
Yeah, I’m real disappointed
---
lol, remember when I first went there. Was checking if something were running in the background then I just dismissed it as a bug. (Didnt see the doors or turning pictures)
---
paid experience doublers coming 100%, that is bad free to play 101
---
Bethesda sucks at a lot of things, but the customer support for the atomic shop is actually pretty good. 
---
I fat fingered the 4th of july backpack skin by accident and I asked nicely for a refund, a few days later I had my atoms back AND I got to keep the ugly backpack. Was a  simple process, I just submitted a ticket explaining what happened and that was it
---
lol, man they are grasping at straws for things to talk about.  
---
This entire ITV was just a recap of older ITV's.
---
It's been a bug for MONTHS. How much investigating is actually happening? Same with the daily challenges being marked completed at login with no Atoms. That's been "investigated" since fucking March!
---
Tbh I'm not too bothered by the lack of decent rewards, I'm loving the absolute carnage this event is bringing.
---
Destroying anything and everything, were even forking this place up.
---
Still haven't quoted me where I said it's only winnable with repair kits.  
---
You quoted me explaining what pay 2 win is..... you quoted me explaining how they implemented their pay 2 win system..... but nothing about me saying it's only winnable if you buy kits.   
---
So how much do you get paid per hour?
---
Timezon? 😄
---
Oh yeah it is definitely boring. Won't lie to you there. It's just the path of least resistance for me to get some free weapon skins. I'm only level 13 in it because I had already given up on getting all the rewards about 3 days into playing NW. I'll continue to take the limited time rewards as long as they make them AFK friendly.
---
I did manage to reach the top 10 in one match yesterday. I must have picked a really good bush that time. Lol.
---
im guessing that you don't believe me. here:

I hate these "sum everything up they already know" ItVs. Feels like they don't have any info. They know we know they have info, so why not trickle something
---
Literally every last thing in this weeks ITV was already discussed in prior ITV's/news releases.  
---
Bethesda, you can do better.
---
But what does pay to win mean?
---
Current workaround is to friend someone on the map and respawn on them.
---
Pretty damn good idea tbh. 
---
I get far less “activity points” for trying to play the BR mode like a BR mode then being incentivized to either win at all costs (hack) or spend the match  hiding in a bush which isn’t really exciting.
---
Idk but I think private worlds are regardless more stable cause I havent crashed once when doing the event( makes me more pissed that they are able to keep private worlds stable but not public worlds)
---
Dude this is literally a post about the rampant cheating in nuclear winter.
---
&gt;:(
---
I haven't had a crash on Xbox so far, but it's laggy as hell. It sometimes takes a long time to get the torches lit. Like up to 30 seconds on some of them which takes up way too much time in a timed event. One time the eyebot got stuck inside a car and couldn't progress to lead us to the next spot. Blowing up the vehicle helped him get back on track though. I've done the event 7 times so far because I'm just trying to get the orange pumpkin suit, but I haven't gotten any costumes yet.
---
Yes. Real men pay for good time and a happy ending!
---
I did, if only she cared about my character level!
---
I like this idea!
---
I make $1000 an hour!
---
You can't make angery frownies on Reddit &gt;:(
---
I fell ya. I love orginally just wanted the laser rifle skins but since got hooked. 
---
I’ve found that being stupid but Forrest Gump stupid seems to mind game people.
---
No kidding.
---
At this point, I don’t know if they can.
---
Get there before the event starts, like before it even pops up on the map.  I'm on pc but since I started doing that I've not crashed once.
---
If you play a lot and plan on continuing to do so I recommend it.
---
Got my full support here mate.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pumpkin_(Fallout_76)
---
Horrible bug. Two ways to get around this I know of is the rug glitch or moving the floor or foundation peice to an open area and placing your items on that. Then put the floor piece back where you want them.
---
Yea, if you paid for them. You are trying to get atoms without paying.
---
That's what the atom shop was supposed to do.  Also compared to other passes in other games it's way overpriced.  I could buy 2-3 passes with the money Bethesda is asking for.
---
Grahm, some train stations
---
Is the expansion DLC free? Asking for a friend..
---
I mostly agree with you, but do understand that those of us who've been in since the BETA feel justifiably burned, and Beth had done nothing to remedy this.
---
That’s a weak itv
---
They just want it all to blow over, so that they can introduce another wave of P2W features.
---
Thanks
---
When my group and I play, at least one of us blue screen every single time we do mischievous night. If not several times. One of us died, and was kicked from event. Couldn't do damage or collect anything off the robots. It's getting really annoying.
---
I would pay for 1st if it included some sort of character inventory transfer containter or something. I cant justify the price yet.. it's almost the exact same as the game I already have. And plus, I like selling stuff to people..
---
Maybe they'll offer different menu music in the atom shop 🤞
---
it's sort of rare at train station vendors. not whitespring tho, I got mine at sunnytop station
---
You can only add sweets like gun drops, candy cotton and Halloween candy.
---
UPDATE: for $9.99 you can do it every 30 min.
---
It’s going to cost $150 plus a DNA and a tissue sample.
---
yeah, i am only using this at distance now. I'll keep my handmade on me for the up in your face enemies
---
My bugs haven't been super crazy, but last night the game froze except for audio. I could see another player a few feet away. I just gave up and put the controller down and checked email. About four minutes later the game actually started working again, and that same player near me was still there and doing his thing. It's like the game just paused, then picked up where it left off.  
---
Then a few minutes later it froze again and never recovered.  
---
Besides that, the three minute loads to get into worlds or fast travel are pretty spooky.
---
I tried to put mutation serum in it... lol
---
I disagree that paying for a service like this is "ruining games" or anything similar.  The amount of entertainment compared to the cost for games in general I find to be a great value at this stage in my life.  
---
That said, I haven't bought 1st and don't plan to.  I earn enough atoms to buy the few items that appeal to me in the atom store as it is and I don't think I need any of the perks 1st offers.    
---
But if I was inclined to buy atoms, I'd just buy 1 month of this service instead.  Load up the scrap box with as much junk as I can gather while I have the sub active and call it good.
---
And people actually paid for F1st LMAO!
---
🤑
---
Ohhh :( I was optimistic Beth was doing hot fixes on the Survival servers.
---
Boooo you suck almost as hard as FO76!
---
&gt;I just don't see the point right now.
---
It's called whaling.
---
I’ll try the foundation thing, rug thing didn’t seem to work for me. And even though I stored the entire upper floor I cannot store the stairs, though I can move them. It makes no sense
---
I am on ps4, i havnt had any crashes or blue screens only crappy rewards. But I have only done the event 3 times. I gave up with the event.
---
Camps do transfer over. I’m a member testing it out. The mod part sounds like an add or just to make people pay up. They wont give modders free hands, for what you mentioned about the atom store. They might add stuff to the store (seems more realistic, even if its actually absurd).
---
Any guess as long as it means more money seems realistic at this point.
---
(Yes, I play this game and I’m critic, who aint at this point?)
---
If you want it, get it. Who  really cares what rando's on reddit think?
---
I was waiting for the next Atom bundle to drop anyway. I would have spent $9.99 for 1500 Atoms and a unique outfit, so for $3 more, I got 1600 Atoms and a bunch of other stuff.
---
Do you have a good way of finding Grahm?
---
I'll explain it another way in the off chance you are serious.  
---
Time saving items is Pay to win.   
---
Warframe uses this model as a free to play game, it's wildly successful because they add new content for free but give you the ability to earn the content if you wish to grind. The grind is long sometimes being a week or more. You can "speed" up that process with **buying** the "Crafting time"  
---
Using a repair kit will save you the following:  
---
You will save on resources.  
---
you will save on caps for travel expenses  
---
you will not have to risk venturing around the landscape for scrap and worry about dying to lose all scrap.  
---
it saves you a perk slot because now you no longer need the repair perk card because it's inferior to the repair kit.  
---
if you were in a survival server every second counts, repair kits are very advantageous in that situation.  
---
By buying the repair kits you are saving the time and energy you would normally spend playing by the game mechanics. That is why it's called Pay 2 Win.   
---
It's not literal... it's basically saying anyone who has it will always have an advantage against someone who doesn't. if you don't care about game balance then it's fine. however the real problem is the fact Fallout 76 was promised not to have this since BETA.   
---
That's why people are angry with it.
---
Is it just a bug or intended? I couldnt imagine theyd just remove that one only. Its kind of weird
---
Go for it if you like it get it. At the end of the day it's your money spend it where you like.
---
So you’re whining?
---
you must be the popular kid at school.
---
Went perfectly smooth for me when I freed up that 400lbs of junk that was chilling in my stash
---
No, I’m the no-nonsense military NCO.
---
i agree but they way the handle things i wouldn’t put it pass them
---
Yeah asbestos lining with fireproof doesnt even stop you from burning. There is no defence to an explosive splitter laser rifle other than knowing how to use one better than the opponent
---
You’re making a lot of assumptions, I have purchased mtx to support Beth because I want this game to succeed, but this subscription costs way too much for the one feature (scrap box) any of us gives a damn about and I refuse to support blatantly greedy business practices.
---
I work in enterprise networking so my job requires that I be very familiar with networks, databases and all elements in between which the scrap boxes are entirely based off of; I can make a very informed opinion of how this was implemented and designed from both a customer and operational perspective, and have implemented and maintained systems that work in a very similar manner.
---
Convenience items available to everyone aren’t convenience; they’re features of your offering to enhance your customer experience and drive more sales to your primary revenue stream (MTX) example: the punch bowl or message terminal or the vendor.
---
What they’re doing here is opening a new revenue stream and paywalling requested features to force people to buy it.
---
I hope this helps you make an informed decision on my opinion.
---
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatecompany.asp
---
100% this. This is the most valid complaint and so very politely posted. Please do not ignore this one.
---
Nope. Just wander around. During meat week he was easy to find but that has passed
---
What is really happening is that a ton of shitty YouTube personalities want to farm people for views.
---
We really should be doing an exposure piece on how youtubers are manipulating the gaming world and not for the better.
---
when you think of this as a pass then you are thinking of it wrong. this is a private server rental fee that comes with other perks.
---
Redundant update is redundant
---
its xp farm rewards 250 xp is a bat skin for assault rifle
---
etc
---
Complete walkthrough:
---
* Head to event zone.
---
* Try to participate 
---
* Buzzcrash to system dash.
---
* Log back in to find event is over.
---
* Listen to the last handful of diehard fans in Facebook fan groups saying the fix is to pay $99us a year for a private server that only crashes some of the time, like that's an acceptable idea.
---
* Go back to Outer Worlds 
---
Hope that helps!
---
Yeah the subtitles and text is hard to read in general , in this game. I cant stand trying to read what the rewards list says when i complete a quest or event.....having to move around so i can see it against the background.
---
But without a doubt they sould add something to make things easier for you. I would expect that much by todays standards , really.
---
Makes you wonder why what's essentially a copy / paste article took longer than usual.
---
I like how you asked me a question, then called it whining when I answered you.
---
I have been in the event 4 times now today al of which I froze half way through and never got to finish. This is ridiculous!
---
I actually have an old version of the video, i have a version of 76 i havent updated in forever, i can get it to you if you want.
---
Wait, what does the Bunyan statue do??
---
There's no actual negative to text chat, so idk why it's not implemented.
---
Brahmin blows steam from all 4 nostrils and it plays a chime.  Slight arm / head movements as well.
---
I'm American and haven't heard of it either.
---
No idea, UK person here n was wondering the same lol
---
I've been taking it as we are literally forking the place up
---
CET
---
Thats what happens when you play a broken mess made by a broken mess. Good luck with all that
---
Yeah it’s a thing in certain parts of the country. 
---
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=forked&amp;amp=true&amp;defid=852212
---
They should remove the timer on this event and let you server hop it to your heart's content.
---
Would have been better than Whitesprings for sure! That way low level players could join and not have to worry about a nuke too. They honestly should have done a couple places on the map for different difficulty levels!
---
I don't mind paying for a private server I just like how it's tied to a service that I don't want.
---
Absolutely - you do you and enjoy the game.  There are definitely ways to get legendaries at your level that other folks covered so if you're going slow and steady definitely read over those suggestions and good luck!
---
My bad - yes, you're correct that each individual item jumps in blocks of 10.  Every 5 levels from 5 to 50 you have access to new things is what I meant, but I could have said it better for sure
---
Wow, that seems so fake, yet it's in urban dictionary....
---
Thank u
---
It's a thing. You stick a bunch of plastic forks into someone's yard and it's a pain to clean up. Same thing with the idea of TPing - it's easy to get and real hard to clean up.
---
Find a group you like playing with, that is number 1 on the list for me. Ammo/med sharing, callouts, and focus fire are serious advantages to teams over P/U's or solo players.
---
I personally prefer automatics for the DPS, lighter weights, and availability. They also fit nicely into an aggressive "run&amp;gun" playstyle.
---
Perks:
---
Ground Pounder
---
Master Commando
---
Tank Killer
---
Tenderizer / Long Shot / Demolition Expert (interchangeably, depending on what I feel like doing)
---
Frog Legs
---
Pharma Farma
---
Bloody Mess
---
**Use chems**, Pharma is mostly for Med-X, I keep one active at all times for the +50DR, psycho, fury,bufftats all give either dmg boosts, or dmg mitigation for gunfights.
---
Follow-up response -  While the "can't sell one item for less than one cap" thing is potentially annoying, I suggest the path of charity, as you ARE allowed to "Vend" items for ZERO caps in any quantity. (and now off to implement this myself...)
---
Yikes, such a way to waste plastic...:(
---
Text chat will be $9.99+ tax per month, or $100 for a year....what a deal! /s
---
My tactic is similar to prevent my rising anxiety and blood pressure that leads to rage quitting. I simply find the last spot of the event before it crashes, turn off my console and never play Fo76 again. It feels amazing.
---
Never heard of it.
---
Super laggy on PS4. No crashes out of my 4 times through, yet. Twice I can hear the event for a bit while on the losing screen. One of THOSE times, the event actually ended as gameplay opened, but it gave me the awards, so I wasn't as miffed... 
---
Lots of lags while running along the cottages. AND it's lag in PLAY AND SOUND. Usually I notice the lag is in play only. Like, I can hear the ghouls killing me, buuuuuuuuuttt play lags so I can't kill them first and I die. 
---
Anyone else noticing that it's both?
---
if you would be paying the same amount for the private server then whats the problem? thats actually a lower price than a majority of hosted private server offerings
---
Shit I live in the ghetto. We would either leave them or lawnmower it and keep it pushin
---
pm my ign
---
On xbox a lot, on PS4 a lot more, on PC I have no clue since I don't have it on PC. Simple judge of it is do a dance then watch how many other do it also to assist in being annoying then take note if others are wearing ranger or have 1st icon.    
---
On xbox with server hopping for 12 hours for the event it seemed close to 50%, on PS4 with my son doing it for 4 hours and having 3 servers filled with 1st players I would wager closer to 60% just playing the odds as I doubt it is higher than that.   
---
This is all anecdotal since I have no real raw numbers and just a general opinion from looking at players.
---
Well I mean I dont understand your argument against it but I dont promote the service either so either way
---
I've never actually seen it done but I've heard of it happening. Its' one of those things that happen on TV but not in real life. Same thing with TPing
---
As opposed to sticking in the lawn in the first place.....
---
it's just as big a PITA to put them in and you also have to buy them.. so it's kinda a derp thing to do..
---
Last night i had a lag so bad it froze my game on ps4 and the same with my team mate...hers didnt completly freeze up to the point of having to close out like how i had to....still got the rewards tho...lol. But I did it about 5 times before that happened to me.
---
\[pauses in mid-stride as I put the duck on the scale again... \] wait WHAT? Awwwwww.
---
See, I might have actually gotten it if I had known that. Much like the satellite dish. Someone needs to tell Bethesda that people might buy things if they knew what it was and how it worked!
---
Dude, you’re crying about a video game.   I’m just trolling you because it beats cleaning out my storage locker.  Truth be told, I honestly don’t care.  I’ve watched bodies get loaded onto planes and I dealt with enough mortar and IED attacks to tune the stupid “OMG!!! They want $13 a month” crap out.  You sound like a super entitled high school cheerleader. It’s like you want a participation trophy just for playing.  If you liked this game before the sub, then simply grind a few atoms every now and again to compensate.  Otherwise, move on!
---
What? Thats what I meant
---
Thanks.

I’m normally support minded. Tank and spank but that doesn’t really work in NW. but since I’m pretty stealth minded in 76 that’s where my thought is. Sadly I personally can’t do that. So I try and just be a demo expert. With limited success.
---
$4.99 a month or $49.99 a year and you can have the “FO76 SuperPatch” edition that will not crash. It might still crash though because it’s a buggy mess.
---
Yeah, the Atomic shop is just a big bag of missed opportunities.
---
🤦🏻‍♀️ Would you like some 🧀 with that 🍷? It’s crashed like once on me and I have done it a crap ton.
---
Unlikely. I've done the event at least 16 times with the same outfit and weapon with varied results. RNG can be a cruel mistress though.
---
You mean you don't want Pastor's Vestments every time you complete the event? Yeah me either. I like the pirate hat I got though. I lag something fierce during the event though. It seems fun.
---
Ps4?  Or xbox?
---
nope I'm convinced you are just responding to your own arguments in your head at this point.   
---
none of your replies have made sense.
---
The issue is that you have to put the forks in by hand yourself. It takes nothing to TP a house. That's a much heavier workload cleaning up vs pranking
---
It only shows up in the ITV for 1st subscribers.
---
Reminds me of a thing in folklore, about witches being compelled to count.
---
You'd chuck nails or needles or whatever on your lawn, and the witch would be too busy counting to actually curse you or something.
---
Well shit, lemme tell you as a 1st member, I didnt see shit loooool
---
I've crashed once. It seems to not crash as much if I stay in first person.
---
On PC.  I played it 5 times on Tuesday, no crashes. I played it 5 times last night, 4 crashes. So I'm running a 40% crash rate. Not good.
---
I got the full outfit in a row on my first night! I’ve been running round with a Broadsider all Halloween now😂
---
&gt;very politely posted
---
Very rare in here.
---
Lol love it
---
It's the new subscription service where you pay $5 a month to get further updates about updates.
---
Why are you dropping plans? Just trade em.
---
Fine on xbox.  Been swapping since onset.  Did have a fall thru world event that i recorded though.
---
Shietttt
---
Try dropping something like dirty water to make a bag appear, the put plans inside...magic!
---
it might be because it makes an annoying sound, and not because you pay real money for it.
---
If you're just looking for something to allow you to write in camp, the atoms shop has a neon / light blub letter set that goes for 500 atoms, I think. The plan you're looking for is definitely snazzier, but harder to find and costs a ton of caps, IIRC.
---
Then continue to cry in the corner due to the evils of Bethesda.  Because they’re definitely the most evil people in the world today.  I mean, they seemed to have made a game where you need repair kits to succeed.  Though I kinda wonder, what’s the drop rate for the upgraded kits?
---
The costume type has no bearing on rewards.
---
Carrots.
---
Probably not at all, but your version of reality is interesting
---
Can't say I'd personally recommend it, but there are lots of players ~~exploiting~~, ahem, *utilizing* the combination of Grenadier/Frog Legs/Demo Expert. Toss in a secondary weapon type of choice to supplement. Grenade launchers are common enough in yellow crates, you can find one easily enough.
---
And Sugar Bombs! They count for some reason even though they’re cereal
---
why would you quit a fun game over some internet drama when you could just ignore the drama and still have the same fun playing the game as you did last week?
---
Oh man the timer... I have lvl 2 of the fireproof perk and I can stand on top of exploding robots and barely take any damage! Now all I have to watch out for is mobs of robots
---
It’s mentioned... did you read it?
---
Ah I didn’t have none of those. I thought you could loads of Halloween candy in but no just 10.
---
Empath serum is the ultimate trick
---
This x2
---
Best return, easy event, provides low levels with access to legendary weapons.
---
It's got a pretty decent runtime if you stop to smell the roses here and there. Character builds aren't crazy but there is room for multiple playthroughs. Started with a slow time sniper crit build which is going to play super different than a melee build, but other than those two there isnt much variety IMO. Excellent style and writing though so I will undoubtedly run through twice with those builds
---
Doing what now?  I try and stay away from cheat if able.
---
He keep popping up at the Poseidon Energy Plant area a lot.
---
I have them. But i prefer the neon neon ones
---
Blessed Samhain and Happy Halloween to you, too!
---
I've upvoted this for visibility. I think I saw a similar post not too long ago. Perhaps it was also you on another sub? Absolutely the best of luck with this!!
---
Enjoy your new keyboard (because rainbow LEDs are the best ever), and Blessed Be!
---
I had to look it up.  Fallout 3, NV, Oblivion, Skyrim, and tso all use the havok physics engine.  Thats what I was thinking of.  I always attributed that random ouch it .  Not sure what the issue is with the newer fallouts, as I assumed it was the same.  Its been that way for a long time.  Tripping on a skeleton always used to trigger it too.
---
0% are broken
---
Bruh, it's literally like one fucking sentence with the phrase fallout 1st in towards patch 14 updates review. Literally that's it.
---
Youd think if you just brought out a Subscription service, youd actually wanna talk about it in the next indept news article you release.
---
They could've saved themselves time and just not brought out an ITV at all
---
Chief they mean stuff like griefing, nuking the whitesprings is part of the game.... and besides that applies to you not letting him have his fun with the nuke. If your particular server wants the whitesprings nuked you preventing that stops their enjoyment and normal flow of gameplay. 
---
Its the fallout universe, nukes happen.
---
They didn't. First was mentioned very briefly in passing, as a 'On top of first and Halloween, this is what else you should pat our backs for.'
---
Did they "fix" them?
---
Still preferable to the FO4 version of this bug, in which you trip on a car... and DIE INSTANTLY.
---
I want raiders v.s. settlers faction war with wastelanders. every hour the system would mark a random battle area. Players would have to talk to a faction npc to join the war, then tune into faction war radio station to find out where the current objective is, and then rewards would go to whatever faction takes it over.
---
You think a private server that only holds 8 people, is non persistent, server shuts down if no one is a fallout 1st member, with no privacy settings or admin tools, and no mod support is worth $13 a month or $100 dollars a year?
---
Except for that one guy who had never played Fallout (any of them!) before who came in here to tell us why everyone was mad. Argh.
---
Also, some delusional soul downvoted you... so have an upvote. :)
---
IMHO if you are going to buy atoms, might as well get the sub for the month. The tent is nice from fast travel perspective. The private world is boring but it is nice if you have to claim a workshop for a challenge or to farm mats. The scrap box is killer and does provide an advantage. I have been farming lead, steel, acid, and antiseptic for future use. I also pulled my flux from my flux storage toon and stuck it in the scrapbox to free up it up so I can level it. I bought it for the atoms, and the next day turned off the auto renewal. If I want atoms again I will probably sub for a month again and drop. It is a good deal for atoms but I only would buy them at most every few months.
---
I can't blame you - I definitely agree.
---
Yeah well that’s bullshit.  I am burning through ammo and taking more damage than necessary because people aren’t helping.  Fuck that.  I see you pull that shit you will be on the receiving end of my AAE FFR handmade.
---
time for me to finally visit Point Pleasant in the game lol
---
What, were they supposed to kiss this pathetic subreddit's ass over the tantrum?
---
What do you want? They just went into a ton of detail last week.
---
I’ve never seen anyone do this. Why would you? It’s too much effort for a prank
---
Sorry about your stroke
---
For me it's like a bruise. It hurt once so now I've got to keep messing with it
---
turn the game up
---
I see it up quite often. I didn't know it was a good xp place, but maybe il farm it more. The sounds are just annoying as fuck durning it
---
Why release ES6 when we can just release Skyrim... again?
---
Are you on console? I'm on PC ..one crash out of 10+ completions.
---
Quick question, no hate or anything, just curious, why are you still playing that game? I mean it is garbage, there is letteraly close to nothing to do, and the few things present seems to crash regularly... Why? Why are you inflicting that to yourself?
---
$60 a year would be way more in line for all features, but I still believe the scrap box and tent should be features of the game and not paywalled.
---
The subscription should be solely for discounts, special subscriber content and monthly atoms.
---
Personally, the tent is useless to me, but stash space is the most requested feature aside from in game chat and it is downright scummy to open a introduce a new revenue stream and force people to purchase a new game feature they’ve wanted since beta.
---
It actually would have went over a lot better if they charged 2k atoms for a one time purchase for the scrap box, but it’s way too late now.
---
**Not** a cheat, just a cheese, lol.
---
You can pretty easily wipe a team with those three perks and a grenade launcher. Frog jump up, shoot at their feet, and perked out, you do 200+ dmg per shot, so 1-2 shots to down someone. Rinse/repeat. 
---
Find an explosive bobblehead for 30% more damage, and you can do 280 dmg per shot, which can insta lightly armored players.
---
Regardless of my thoughts, it's a valid playstyle that can be a *highly* effective alternative, if you aren't as steady with gunning.
---
more like they were reading reddit and saw a thread and  proceeded to write an article on it.
---
Excuse me?
---
Let's compare the past two ITV :P  
---
https://imgur.com/a/Hz9U7sv
---
did you really expect anything different?
---
Ive TPed and forked a house before. So its not a TV thing.
---
Hey I am lagging and sometimes my screen freezes so I won't be much help as well.
---
Are you guys by any chance wearing the High Capacity Backpack? The one that reduces your rad resistance by 60?   
---
I also think they buffed the amount of damage done by ghouls/poisonous creatures (Mirelurk Kings, for example, are now VERY nasty).
---
I nuke it anyways to make it even more frustrating because fuck this community
---
Just a one s. But messing with those settings is a good idea!
---
nuking the whitesprings while the event is going on specifically to fuck with the people at the event falls under this. the fact that his action violates the rule does not actually mean that me telling him about it makes my action against the rule.
---
I want communication. The ITV is about the closest we get to see how communicating with Beth actually works. 
---
All they proven with this ITV is they can't deal with PR issues what so ever. Loool
---
Buy it, get annoyed by it and buy something else. Why fix it.
---
is this event on specific timer?
---
How will that help? 🤣
---
Not trying to be a dick, but did you try turning off and back on your pc?
---
Has solved many a problems for me.
---
sounds about right. my philosophy with this gun is going to be stand back and shoot..wayyyyy back
---
Definitely not.
---
They also didnt mentiong how the botched the new event either lmao
---
Not expecting them to kiss anyones ass. But you know talking about why they brought it out and ideas for it would be great, especially since that Subscription was one of the biggest games changes to this game since perhaps the TSE Nerf
---
Right, because its not like the first thing I have to do in NW now is run to a dark corner of the vault because the sound of punching has been replaced with the sound of 20 people playing cheasy breakdance music at different times so it blends into a horrendous cacophony or anything.
---
What I noticed as odd and has to be a bug is if you get say the fireman outfit about 30 minutes later the fireman hate shows up, same with pirate outfit ranger clean halloween witch and so on. But if you get the hat in the rewards list you do not get the outfit.   
---
I am just now getting doubles and I have changed my outfit 3 times. But really it is just RNG sometimes you got luck sometimes you don't.
---
Haha thanks. 
---
What gives me a chuckle is all the people making “I quit posts” and still comment months later
---
Yeah, the timer ticks down until you light the fire. I normally go into adventure mode at the beginning of the hour and once we complete the event I hop right into a private server to complete the next event on my own. I normally have 6-7 minutes to light the fire but sometimes I cut it close with only only 1-2 minutes left. I've only missed it once but that was because the event in adventure mode was super laggy. 
---
You can actually do it three times in a row, but I play it safe and only try to do it two times, once in adventure and again in private.
---
You’d be telling them milking you for pennies is ok
---
Yeah I have experienced this on several occasions, sometimes its multiple disconnections or blue screen crashes. The newest one for me is freezing in menus ie moving stuff from stash or eating, drinking. It results in me having to restart the entire game. It really is a buggy piece of shit , I like it though but the bugs are getting old and it's causing me to have less interest in the game. I'm on the ps4 pro if that matters. Just want to let you know that it's happening to others. as all the responses here can't really understand as they all report  no issues.
---
I NEED the fusion cores from the sentry bots! But I got the pirate outfit and an AA/ E black powder pistol, so I've missed out on several cores that way..
---
cherry on top would be locking wastelander content behind fallout 1st. that would drive sales up so much faster.
---
Well I expected that not to show, they're horrible about talking in game issues. Guess I should've expected this.
---
It was hardly one of the biggest changes to the game, it barely changed a god damn thing besides private servers.
---
Gameplay is still fundamentally the same as it was two weeks ago
---
I got killed twice during the Halloween event by Gutsys.  Never happened to me before.
---
Shared loot for "all players in the event" has not been implemented.   
---
But players on same team can loot mobs they did not personally hit. (mostly).   
---
(tested at One Violent Night, a few other events).
---
I picked mine up in Harpers.
---
Ive seen it at Watoga. Sunnytop, and R&amp;G too.
---
It is the new TP'ing for tricksters.
---
What kind of communication do you want? I am genuinely curious? What do you want them to say?
---
You paid for that. Please remember it.
---
No, adding a Subscription into a game a year after launch, is a huge game changer in how a game is viewed.
---
I need the pain. It hurts so good 🤕🥴
---
And then someone ELSE downvoted. Apparently people don't like hearing that no one cares outside of an immediate group of people. MY OPINION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN ANYONE ELSE'S, YOU KNOW!! Riiiight.
---
There are so many of those! But I figure if you quit, then you at least know what you left behind. This guy seemed so confused that BOTH sides of the argument turned on him. lol
---
turning up the volume would do no good for someone that lacks the ability to hear.
---
I'm on ps4 pro and it's crashed about 4 out of the 10 attempts that I've been around for. I had two crashes happen back to back and on my first two attempts I was pissed lol. 
---
I've noticed staying behind the pack killing mobs and letting everyone else trigger the car explosions helped with the stability. 
---
Or a least I think it's helping lol....
---
It’s kinda silly when you think about it- I got your back with another upvote haha
---
LSD man.  Tripping brah!
---
No idea. I’ve gotten a different pumpkin plan each of the 7 times that I’ve done it
---
For the last 3 months I have been set up in savage divide on the path the brahmin take, and I have never had any problems. Unless this is a recent bug that's been implemented.
---
I got fireman hat, no outfit
---
I want to give more indept patch notes, on par with most other games that list every single change they make. I want narrative on future upcoming changes. I want narrative on the Subscription and not just the marketing page they put out. Almost every other game I enjoy and follow give out huge patches listing every change and reasoning for these changes, it gives the community that play and follow it a feeling openness. Bethesda doesnt supply this what so ever.
---
Yes, that would be sweet. I can prob make a mod to change the menu back to the original then.
---
Unfortunately, that’s something I’m reminded of everyday, when I browse my game library.
---
Hopefully with the success it’s had we’ll get a new, even better Outer Worlds title in a couple years! It’s such an awesome game and has scratched the itch I’ve had for a good single player RPG I’ve had for years now.
---
You can also get it from some Workshop defense events
---
I feel they could have skipped this edition.
---
I just find this funny as "There’s plenty of XP and themed rewards to go around, so be sure to take part in the Mischief Night celebration for some tricks and treats before the festivities conclude at 12:00 p.m. ET on November 5.". More like " see how many times you can crash before Nov 5th, if you dont want to crash, buy fallout 1st"
---
You don’t think we got that last week? What don’t you feel like you understand? Their patch notes always seem pretty hefty to me.
---
They’re all called that in the build screen. But scroll thru them and you’ll see your evil pumpkin is unlocked. The same sort of thing happens with many many plans, like tables, chairs, shelves, etc.
---
Yeah I may or may have not TPd a few houses on Halloween in my time :P
---
Well it's obvious it's a prototype considering the name. You want Jes-3r for the finished look.
---
Ngl man you kinda sound like a fun sponge
---
If wastelanders is given to fallout 1st members early I’m uninstalling the game and never playing it again lol
---
Bought mine from the vendorbot in the Watoga Super Duper Mart.
---
I have the same issue. 
---
When I leave the trade after they request the legacy gat plas, I also get followed around, shot at and harassed. 
---
If you initiate a trade with me, I will assume you are trying to sell something.  I put my for sale stuff up in a vendor like everyone else.  
---
I do not accept the trade to sell you something, I assume you are the trader.
---
It’s a membership, not a season pass. 
---
However, it’s an interesting question.
---
Oh
---
Has crashed every time I’ve done it
---
Yes. Several Vault Boys, one mobster after some 20 runs.
---
I should have explained my comment better but that would mean writing a lot more. So, 1st didn’t make me quit. None of the sensationalized negativity ever made me stray from 76. It is legitimately a fun game for me. I like games where I can just ‘live’ in another world with no real consequences or goals. I’ve played GTAV for years just riding the BMX around and improving my skills for no real reasons. 
---
I played 76 mainly just to Sherpa people through quests, help with building camps, improve on my own crazy designs, and try to get “all the plans”. I played every single day from release until end of August. I went on a cruise back then and when I got back I strangely had no desire to play 76 again. Right when I got back from vacation, I bought a gaming PC because I’ve wanted one for a while now. I game steam a try, got some free stuff on the epic store, and bought 76 for the 5th time. I played for a few hours and marveled at how much better it looks on ultra settings on pc than it does on a PS4 pro. I couldn’t port my profile which was a bummer given how many hours I’ve sunk into the game and how much money in atoms. No matter, it’s still the 76 I can casually enjoy. 
---
Since the PC is still new, I’ve been playing a wide mix of games. The smoothness of other titles alone made it hard to go back to 76, I love it but it’s glitchy as hell. I love bugs and glitches, that’s originally why I stuck with 76 for so long. I made videos showing some of those off including my personal favorite, the camera launch glitch. I can still build floating structures (UFO’s and airships) using camp glitches and see into the unknown with a camera glitch that still works. So the more glitches the better, that’s not why I’m done either. 
---
When they announced the fallout 1st thing, I guess the big blow to me, as a long time fan, was that it includes so many things we’ve been trying to bring to Bethesda’s attention for a year now, and they don’t respect the player base that’s left. They took our suggestions and are monetizing them. I’ve wanted more camp budget for a while, now it’s gonna be locked behind yet another paywall eventually. I wanted test servers (not for us, for the dev team) so they could test updates before releasing them in a buggy state. I wanted more stash space, but not to pay for it. And before I start getting replies like “you can’t expect it all to be free”, that’s Stockholm syndrome. They can certainly make those changes without charging but they didn’t. They could do so much positive stuff with it, but they just aren’t. And I’m one of the ones that defended (and still would defend) the scrap kits and repair kits because those honestly aren’t bad. But 1st is a big middle finger to those that want the game to be better imo. You don’t have to agree, and I’m certainly not taking a massive stand or anything. I logged on yesterday to check out what’s new and I might log on again today. But I’m done giving them any more money. 
---
To those that still play, don’t let anyone tell you you shouldn’t enjoy 76, it’s fun to just stumble upon others and see where the adventure takes you. Most fun I’ve had with a game in a long time. But just cause I like it doesn’t mean I have to agree with their business decisions, those are atrocious.
---
make  it louder
---
Well, given the circumstances of raiders, supermutants, radiation sickness, getting eaten by mole rats, or being beat to death by ghouls, I guess cancer is on the bottom of the list.
---
Shouldn’t everyone get the tent, so they can enjoy it with you?
---
there was a very small percent of people that had issues at launch, but those issues have been resolved. 
---
Most of us have not had any issues.
---
I’ve done the event once, every time I try to log in to play I can’t even get passed the loading screen. Not even going to bother trying anymore.
---
Everything about this response makes me pity you.
---
Yeah I've had those. I think the only camp item I haven't seen is the empty pumpkin rack.
---
which does not help someone who cannot hear to begin with.
---
People were dup'n them, so there is a surplus. 
---
I rarely find them in-game and they are pricey but for awhile every vendor had a bunch of them from this.
---
It'll come with 1500 free atom, an exclusive skin worth another 800 Atom, and two utilities you can't get by any other means though, so I'll probably pay for that too. God help me.
---
their problem
---
Yes that's probably best...
---
Same here!
---
You can msg ppl on the playstation phone app not what your asking for I know but it saves having to leave game screen to write msg on ps just same as texting
---
They got this out of the new Recapbox.
---
I had one person hit my premium box with a sledge for a minute, then start hitting me. I just behaved as if he/she didn’t exist and they went away after a few minutes.
---
Thanks Bethesda, very cool!
---
They are all just variants of the classic pumpkin.
---
I would love for you to have this.  There are zero negatives to this and it would benefit you immensely.
---
They going to refund my day-1 collector's edition? Then sure, full subscription go!
---
Just make it louder, not that hard
---
They do run smoother.  
---
Thats why we all jump to private when our crew gets on.  So we have a better server with less lag.
---
This is more condusive to raid events like V94 and Queenie which can be lag fests with a high server population. 
---
This is the same reason people used to go to survival mode for V94.
---
Not crashing for me :)
---
You can thank Salem for that.
---
The only ‘glitch’ that affected a small percentage of users was with the scrap box. That was fixed within 48 hours of the first report, I believe.
---
I have no problem with first. I just want narrative. Like I want patch notes like pubg or diablo 3 or Dbd or path of exiles or most other games these days. Stealth nerfs or changes are not really reviewed positively
---
Appreciate the response
---
Because they haven’t had a way to monetize it, it’ll come to fallout 1st members.
---
you sound like the person that parks in handicapped spaces without a permit. 
---
Society hates your kind.
---
&gt;If you don't ping the CMs, they won't respond to you.
---
This is the exact reason for this post.
---
Forking let's you design something. Did it a few times in high school, until we got caught and had to clean them. I think it is mostly because they are cheap or free, and you can't mow the lawn until they are picked out.
---
what about "DEAF" do you not understand.
---
The OP cannot hear,  Volume is not going to fix it, he cant hear.
---
It's crazy how much the servers run better. Everything loads faster as there is less lag. Raids, terminals, looting crate/boxes etc my friend who is melee also tells me that the melee damage bug is practically non existent.
---
I'm Canadian, also never heard of it
---
The damage is completely glitched on explosive laser weapons.  Add in a beam splitter and it’s a complete cheese cannon just like the auto Tesla. 
---
The part I don’t understand is it’s not just overall damage but distance and accuracy.
---
Little things like this is the thing that annoys me most about this game. Such an easy thing to implement but it would take months worth of posts for them to add it
---
Don't forget you have the block option. 
---
It won't help during the trade but when they pester. Blocking hides your blip from them (and theirs from you)  fast travel away and they should never be able to find you on the server. 
---
But I agree. There should be an option that only allows items your interested in before you begin to trade.
---
~~Building in~~ this game somehow got worse 
---
Ftfy
---
No one knows, but even if there was to be some kind of "Wastelanders B.E.T.A." exclusive to subscribers, you can wait until (and if at all) such thing is introduced, which I guess would be at most a month before the official launch, so not this year.
---
You’re not wrong
---
Yes I did. I tried everything.
---
I thought they used havok for the graphics/sound and gamebryo for the actual gameplay and physics. Iirc havok is considered middleware and not considered its own full game engine. Idk though. I just looked it up and it mentions both on the wiki pages for those beth games
---
The event hasn't crashed or lagged for me at all, one of the times i logged into the middle of the event and was fine... It's your hardware not the game
---
Sure, if you pay up...
---
Try posting this on 76Market.
---
I don't think we are allowed to trade in this sub.
---
Also you may need a lot more caps for what you are after.
---
I started another ticket, they canceled it as a duplicate within 10 minutes lol yet my original ticket is going on 22 hours without a reply.
---
You can activate the red rocket sign with a switch. Kinda... Hook a switch up to a flamethrower and place the flamethrower near the sign so the end of the flame hits the sign. Don’t place it too close, if it’s too close the flamethrower will blow up when the rocket launches. 
---
You can even put the switch pretty far away from the rocket to get a better view. You know the sign/rug glitch when wiring up your camp? If so, use that to get the switch far away from the flamethrower.
---
Exactly. It’s so annoying... same thing after the first mischief event where I got the pantsuit first try, so many wanted to trade with me (obviously for the pantsuit) and some followed me around. Didn’t wear it for the next event because of this. Why should I sell a fresh new rare outfit I got a minute ago for caps?
---
Imagine even playing fallout 76
---
I have a bloodied two shot explosive drill....
---
Yeah sorry, it's early and I misread the reply as being to mowing over them instead of picking them up.
---
That's my bad and I unreservedly apologise.
---
Go to the main 76 page, tap top right 3 dots and change user flair
---
Thanks you for the info😁
---
&gt; Also there's been several times now where there's no chance in hell he/they could know where I am on the map. I know where all the consoles are and they were not near any of them. So when I move one direction on the map, and watch them follow me, then change to some other whack direction for simply seeing what they do -they follow me, isnt that a coincidence?
---
How do you know where he is, when he has no way to see where you are?
---
Almost questionable
---
The same as any other event, when the completed popup shows it should show a list under the event icon. But gl completing it
---
Ya and they still made your scrap take up weight. Purposefully.
---
Add my Nametag
---
If you are someone that regularly buys atoms to purchase things like scrap kits (or gear) then it probably makes sense as you get 1600 atoms a month. 
---
I like the idea of a portable camp but other than atoms not much else would benefit me personally.  Having a stash limit of 800 helps my game as I don’t get lost for hours farming - which is easy to do.
---
The progress bar fills quicker during the event if you wear costume pieces, no points to be had.
---
&gt; such a way to waste plastic
---
...if only we could pick all that up! plastic scrap + 500
---
A more general question is whether the previously announced PTS system, that is expected to come in early 2020, would be subscription exclusive?
---
My God. They're not going to even acknowledge the numerous issues since the patch went live.
---
They really are ignoring us. I don't mean just on reddit but all customers.
---
76's dev team isn't that nuanced with their event rewards. It's just RNG, with no way (usually) to affect the outcome.
---
I was pleasantly surprised they added conditional rewards for wearing costumes at the event.
---
I'm loving the event aside from the lag spikes.  Last night, somebody got downed by the Sentry Bot, so I revived them... Only for them to be mowed down by the Sentry Bot again.  Revive again.  Killed by an Assaultron.  Revive again.  Assaultron just happened to be firing its laser at that point.  Fifth time was the charm, though.
---
I'm not a specifically tanky build, but at that moment I reveled in the fact that through all that, by health didn't even drop by a quarter.
---
Being hearing impaired myself (Deaf in one ear), I applaud your tenacity to play games like this, and hope they consider this for a much needed future update.
---
Depends if hes looking for be or tse then yes he needs to up the cap offer by about 40k. If hes just looking for b, e or ts then 10k is more than enuf.
---
after reading this, its way to much effort.  jesus id rather just TP houses.  lower odds of getting caught as well
---
That's right, it's my problem and I am sorry that I burdened you with it.
---
Plenty of plan , no mobster costume yet
---
It's what they're not talking about that really stands out.
---
That makes sense. For some reason I thought maybe it was like the high school event with candy or something.
---
Bro hes messing with you
---
Yeah, throw it in the fucking trash.
---
Hahaha ,the good o'l days
---
It won't blow over. It would have by now if it would.
---
Haha no problem. I know the feeling of still trying to enjoy 76 with the hate-train out in full force. Just ignore the controversy and do whatever you want. I moved on to the outer worlds and honestly do not like it at all. I thought I wanted a new fallout type game, but I kinda just wanna go back to building in Appalachia. We’ll see.
---
That makes perfect sense, cheers I'll give it a shot.
---
I just wear the clown hat in my power armor, have most of the costumes, not mobster yet tho.
---
Thankyou for the thought out reply, I'll give it a try.
---
😂😅
---
Aaand we're back! I don't have an opinion on this one, but I'll pick one, just for you!
---
Scrap boxes are the BEST. EVAR. You'll never convince me otherwise! I double dog dare you to try!
---
Thanks for posting about this, we'll raise this with the devs.
---
Oh I didn’t know that
---
The Nailer is a Cultist Blade.
---
It sounds like you're buying the cake for the frosting. All controversy aside, it doesn't sound like a good enough deal for you judging by what you said. If you were my friend I'd advise against it

 &gt; Thanks for posting about this, we'll raise this with the devs.
---
hook line and sinker.
---
Happy Halloween trick.
---
Looks the same as completing any other event in that you'll see a completion notice and items received on the screen after the final Legendary Sentry Bot is destroyed.
---
Some of the rewards are common, like golf outfits, pastor's vestments and such. Check your weapon inventory, should get at least one pumpkin grenade in addition to possible other weapons. Also check for new clothing and plans. You can get more than one plan per event depending on RNG for that round. Pumpkin plans, cardboard cutout, weapon plans (cultist blade, etc.)
---
There is a full list of things in this sub if you search for it
---
Hey I did last night.  Had some slappy try to gank me with a meat hook and I dropped him like a bad habit.  Killed another guy then his teammates came in and worked me over. 
---
4 v 1 is always fun lol
---
Scariest part of today is Beth's future tbh. This has been a shit show for a full year now, peppered with the good times. Stopped playing a little over a month ago just occasionally checking in on my ex-fellow dwellers.
---
You on PS4?
---
You like pay to win.
---
Getting a one-star rolling pin from a three-star enemy provides a sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
You have many things to raise with them.
---
To be fair, emptying an entire clip on any weapon against an event legendary that's just spawned is an entirely douchey move.
---
Not that it sounds like others at the same event were any more considerate...
---
It takes soooooo long to get the event to start, I hate it.
---
I didn’t know what deaf meant
---
I think you mean forklore
---
...both on the same house? What did that horrible person do to you? lol
---
Once during a Prime Meat event, I had that happen when switching from my minigun to my Exploding Handmade.  That was a fun day.
---
Do the Halloween event you will get all the fusion cores you can handle off the sentry bots
---
Like your console decided, “Fuck it! Recording.”
---
I can partially emphasize. I am deaf in my right ear, and my left ear is failing (otosclerosis). I can no longer tell the direction sounds are coming from, which is frustrating enough. I can't imagine having no hearing, but that's my eventual fate if the surgery fails.
---
I've never heard of this before, but I had never heard of this forking thing, either. But with what you say, it seems seasonally appropriate!
---
If I were lower level, not my 257, I would pay for FO1 for sure because you could farm and level up so much more quicker without having to deal with other players tagging enemies or loot.
---
Bruh
---
Me, too! On both counts! But someone else had said that we're "forking the place up", and that works for me.
---
I think that’s why it’s considered the least useful of mischief night pranks.
---
Man, I really hope you’re right.
---
So far it’s the assault rifle, 10mm, and the minigun paint.
---
This.  Even if Bethesda does nothing about vanishing items and lost characters, they're pretty generous when refunding Atom Shop purchases.  I've never heard anything other than them just refunding the Atoms and letting people keep even mistaken purchases.
---
of all the reasons to add the text chat and update the UI text, this is by far the most important of them. 
---
 at a minimum they need to update the subtitles somehow to give you a clue for noise cues that dont even have subtitles for them.
---
I stand corrected lol
---
Yeah just don't bother trying to use it. My wife got me that one for Christmas last year when gamestop was clearing them out cheap and it looks cool but there's a weird recess in the bottom of the mug that holds a few sips of coffee and when you tilt the mug far enough to get that bit out it dumps it all over your face. I used it once and now it's a pencil holder.
---
You’re not even moderately creative in your ad hominem strategy.
---
What
---
I got the S and it lags out and I just did the event and it freaking didn’t give me nothing at all the event finished but it didn’t say it did, like I wasn’t even in the event
---
This has been asked since Beta. Don’t hold your breath. But hey, here’s a new outfit you can buy in the atom store.
---
Or atleast 3* event bosses should givhave guaranteed 3* items
---
No need to hope. It's on us to not let it blow over.
---
Conclusion: don't give Bethesda any more money
---
Now if you can just raise a few other issues the sub seems to be talking about, that would be great.
---
If they were to do this, they would need to lower the chances of legendaries spawning. They know their fanbase well enough that farmers and grinders like me would abuse this so hard.
---
People really like to give up, though
---
You got that right.
---
Yeah I'm fine with random world spawns giving me a random number of stars, but the Queen, the Imposter, the Alpha and others should give guaranteed 3*...
---
Not in the drop pool. Doesn’t exist in the game.
---
I've ran it 5 plus times not one crash on PC
---
I'm not sure how that's "pay to win."
---
What do you mean abuse this??? Even if it was guaranteed 3* item, the chances of it being good are still low.
---
This seems more like a personal problem than actual criticism of Bethesda.
---
I could be mistaken but I don't think it was on the list of rewards.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm6iyp/full\_list\_of\_mischief\_night\_rewards\_odds\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm6iyp/full_list_of_mischief_night_rewards_odds_of/)
---
I'm on PC, I'm really new to owning a PC so if there's any special fix I definitely haven't done it
---
I regularly accumulated 30 to 40 legendaries per session.
---
Maybe it was just a fluke on my end? It sure looked like my turrets were doing it, but I've been wrong before.
---
Hence my comment it’s just not fun
---
I just have the regular xbone and I only got booted once and still made it back to the server in time for rewards. Your experience isn't everyone's experience.
---
you dont need to appologize to him.  
---
Most of us are behind you on this one my friend. 
---
Even people like me that most of this community hates.
---
# Mischief Night is pay to win
---
For Xbox users, if you don't have the Xbox One X you're lagging out the event half of the time. Paying for a better console=WIN.
---
Appreciate the advice - I'd be lying if I said I haven't set that up myself before - but it's that kind of workaround that is at-issue here. 
---
What if instead of having to use that many different scripted objects *(each on of those imposes it's own technical cost)* it was as simple as one lever and one red rocket sign?
---
Seems like that would reduce the necessary server impact needed to launch the Rocket - EG no more activating the flamethrower, calculating the damage to the sign, and then destroying the sign - it would *"just work".*
---
Because you win when you pay for a better console.
---
Shots fired.
---
Not really. Was a blatant tactic to drain your atoms and force you to buy more because they dumped better Halloween gear later on. Not getting my money if you do people dirty like that.
---
Also tired of people defending their practices.
---
So in a week I could accumulate hundreds of three stars and 2 stars. It would decrease the value and rarity of items unless they again lowered the chances of God rolls and no one wants it lowered even more than it already is.
---
I’ll have you know I have never shit myself when drinking.
---
I have to pay for PS+... I'm paying to PLAY.
---
167 and I’ve been oneshot by another player a few times and so has my squad
---
so is there a reason i can't repair it is my question
---
Same thing happened to me OP but what's different is I'm just gonna farm the atoms I'm missing to get the stuff from that set that I actually want (just the candy bowl)
---
On xbox for me at least it crashes 50 % of the time and every plan I read it still shows as if I hadn't, I can't craft any of the halloween rewards from mischief night .
---
That happens to me half of the time too.
---
I feel like Fallout 1st would have gone over smoother with the community if it wasn't a blatant shitty cash-grab from the company who hides basic features behind a paywall.
---
Yeah I can’t farm 700 atoms in 4 days though, whole thing is to pressure sell. It’s scummy.
---
Dude no. It isn't Bethesda's fault you're using an out classed rig. Advance with gaming or dont, gaming is a constant up hill grind with certain games only being able to run best on optimal rigs. I'm sorry you're experiencing issues, but perhaps it's time to upgrade.
---
Oh I totally agree. The workarounds are silly if we’re worried about server impact.
---
"100 atoms have been deposited into your account."
---
It hasn't crashed for me on PC, plenty of lag and stuttering though. My friend plays on a laptop and it hasn't crashed for her, either.
---
&gt;I bought the $120 version of this piece of shit game the tricentennial version, because I have a love for fallout. But it was just an empty game, full of empty promises. Go play outer worlds it’s 100 times better
---
Wow, I wonder why they wouldn't reply to you. You seem like such a pleasant, levelheaded person when you're upset about a video game.
---
Make a complaint ticket and ask for a refund
---
If theres no mods for a weapon and it has at least 100% condition health, it wont appear in your workbench. Like a grognaks axe. Are you trying to repair it to 200%?
---
Yea we have till the 12th
---
And every single one you kill should match the stars of said legendary.  You deserve the fruit of your labor, taking the time to do that.
---
Even being guaranteed a 3* drop every time, you’d have a low chance of getting the right rolls on the right weapon due to the sheer number of possible combinations that are possible.  I’ve used the purveyor &gt;100x for the 3* ranged weapon, for example, and I’ve gotten 2 good items only. One or two here and there worth 5k or so, but only 2 items worth &gt;40k.
---
Sure, there would be slightly more “god roll” weapons in circulation, but they would still be extremely valuable/rare.
---
I'll look into it more and get back to you. First thing that comes to mind is maybe having to have the Makeshift Warrior perk of a certain level equipped.
---
LMFAO okay dude. “You pay to win by purchasing a better console” that’s not pay to win, that’s owning something with more processing power. Gamers really are the most oppressed minority eh?
---
Don't think "I'm an idiot" is a valid complaint
---
I just don't like having the event nuked while I'm in it as a majority of people don't. Since only one happens per hour you are fucking over everyone on that server the second you do that and that's a shitty thing to do regardless of whether you're roleplaying a raider or not. (psst raiders wouldn't have access to the nuke silos jsyk)
---
Nah I’m just done. Got my moneys worth out of it. Favourite franchise but they’ve taken the piss with this installation to the series. Royally taken the piss.
---
You gonna really quit the game over a candy bowl?
---
I think it should have happened at night, every (in game) hour
---
The real slutty move is the socks
---
Again, sounds like a case of impulsiveness. I can almost guarantee you Bethesda devs weren't in their offices scheming of ways to trick the players into spending all their hard earned or bought atom points at once and then releasing cooler content. I never just spend atom points. I see something I want, and I save up for it. One thing at a time. I see something else I like? Time to save up again. I'm not defending whatever actions you say they are doing, just pointing out that your argument is illogical. You feel cheated by them, but they weren't out to cheat you in the first place.
---
People get refunds for accidentally buying something all the time, they're basically using the "I'm an idiot" excuse
---
No, over the fact they exploit every single thing they can. It’s just tedious at this point.
---
Just imagine how crazy people would have reacted if this came out while survival was still around. That extra fast travel point would have really made a difference in pvp
---
Actually this is how I got my grim reaper standee. Someone dropped a loot bag with several plans after the event.
---
I'll do the same thing I do for real world Halloween decorations. I will wait until a few days after it ends and buy them at clearance blowout prices hopefully at least 75-90% off. If that clearance sale never materializes then no purchase from me.
---
I don’t understand. I’m on Xbox One S. I’ve crashed three times in 20 or so runs. Is it that much better on One X?
---
Lol, no.  It's called "considering the other perspective."
---
I thought this is a good way of meeting in the middle.  But, you are likely right, those players who like PvP as it is aren't really caring what others think.
---
Seriously, it's crazy how easy it is to trigger those who want to support PvP.  You go right into "don't change it, it's fine as is, etc" and you assume others agree with you.
---
The reality is, most players I know and bump into HATE the workshops as they are now.  Few dare speak up about it, however, because of vitriolic minority responses like you've seen today. I would put the defenders of PvP in the same camp as SJW's. Just because I am happy to wear asbestos and deal with it only means I'm willing to take the crap and still try to get a voice out there.
---
Please tell me a suggestion that has been offered by those who like PvP that addresses the problems so there can be a PvE build area while keeping PvP?  Because so far all I've seen is "Don't change it!"
---
So yeah, I can insult those players who like to have a mechanic that utterly destroys one facet of the game that a /majority/ of the players want to use without the PVP.  It's toxic behavior right now, sorry.  And many people believe the same.
---
Try to suggest something else, instead of just arguing that it should stay.  I'd love to build in the workshops with extra budget.  So would a /lot/ of other people.  But the general consensus is DONT EVEN DO IT, because it's stupidly hosed with PvP.
---
I like that, like at 8:00 PM in game. It's a shame they won't be implementing this idea.
---
You bet they do!  Big time difference!
---
If you think the atom shop isn’t designed to pressure sell and incentive purchases your just flat out naive. 
---
I get you guys like the series. So do I. I fucking love Fallout. Always have and always will. Bethesda is bastardising it. Shill for them
---
All you want to. I’ve looked up your guys comments history. Really seems like you’re on Bethesda defence payroll.
---
Lol right
---
First World problems.
---
Wow you are so awesome. The gift that keeps on giving. You took a shitty situation and chose to make it even worse. You sure are the biggest shithawk in the shit zoo. Wow what a man. Spectral solid shit for days WHOO!
---
turn off the enhanced graphics, it bugs out with fo76 and causes crashes. Turn the gfx down to 1080p or 720p instead of trying to push 4k.
---
Yeah but these items are timed. To force sales. FOMO. Manipulative marketing strategies aren’t cool or clever.
---
What about those perks that locate by chirping sound? I think about it every time I use it.
---
Same.
---
thänks.
---
It kind of is bethesda's fault, because the issue is a bug with fo76 crashing when using the "enhanced graphics" setting on the xbone s and x. If you turn it off, or don't have  a tv that supports it you won't crash.
---
Oh snap, that's right! Yeah that was a big part of it. That was the part that hammered that last nail into the coffin. The community managers admitted to keeping it a secret too, so they could keep the license. Those same guys like Doomsaw who banned anyone for being critical or fighting back against the fanboys, was also protecting a sex predator in charge of the whole shabang. When Disney found out, they pulled support completely and Gazillion was finished. They were already running out of money. But Disney pulling the plug finished them off.
---
The funniest part is that David Von Dorman, the CEO's, Twitter still has a link to Gazillion in the bio, but it leads to a different Gazillion company.
---
Myself and anybody else can never be sure. I've had situations where the turrets on my base have turned on me before lol! I'd suggest waiting and seeing if this occurs again. If it does, submit a ticket and try and get a video of the incident happening.
---
Npcs are really immersion killing for me. I was kind of sad when I heard they were bringing them to 76. But I'll still play because in an addict at this point haha
---
I don't even bother with them, and the first time I saw them was really bummed out about them. Yet again something I cannot use
---
Theyve done this since launch......and im not a complainer, i have fallout 1st etc.... But things like the raider skull mask coming out, then the one with the helmet 2 days later is an obvious ploy to get you to spen atoms and then buy more.  
---
  Im aware thats pretty simple marketing, but it does suck on our end
---
If you don't defend a workshop, it goes away from your claim. For entertainment's purposes, go try to claim every workshop on the board.  Even with a team of people it becomes untenable after a handfull or so, because of all the existing events that kick in and bring in attackers.
---
I think it balances out fine, but they could also add something to help take out those who squat if they wanted.
---
What about ante'ing up on the claim amount?  if you want to claim a workshop, you have to pay whatever was last paid, plus an amount to raise it (perhaps double).
---
Then the owner can do the same, and back and forth until one person cedes to the other.  The caps go to the loser (or just disappear).
---
Haha so funny you're a God damn genius dude.
---
*I would pay for a private world if it worked like fo4, and would keep my world progress when I log in/ out. And/ or if the service included a way to transfer my weapons &amp; armor between my characters, I'd be more likely to pay for it
---
What’s truly baffling is that the SB queen doesn’t give a 3 star every time. It’s the endgame boss.
---
from what i understand its when a buff expires (eg food).  it's like u "take damage" when u get back to regular hp
---
Well that can't be good for long term player attraction, if the public servers are buggy crash prone and slow how will new players be enticed to play?. There options being pay 20, or 30 dollars for the game and another 100 a year depending on where you live? As players drift away they need to attract new players or eventually only the die hard fans remain which won't likely cover costs and those die hards will be expected to pay more and more to maintain profitability for Bethesda
---
Bugs included no extra charge
---
It seams as annoying as Flamingo Flocking a house where you have to pay a fee to remove them. You guys want them back you’ll have to pay me or the flock gets the shotgun.
---
u/uwuwizard
---
Just wish people could detach their own personal enjoyment of something from criticism of it. A lot of these guys are defending the game like I’m offending them personally for having issues. 
---
It’s clear what Beth are doing. And it’s not cool to the few thousand people left playing this fucked game.
---
\*Thumbs Up Emoji\* ... \*\*Runs Away\*\*
---
The event has crashed for me on [XB1] just once so far. The crash occurred at the beginning of the 2nd phase raising mayhem by the cottages.
---
Wait, the others are getting paid?
---
Where's my fucking money Bethesda? I thought we had an agreement? I would support your stupid broken game in exchange for a reward!
---
Lol, love how people who don't understand how business works think they're getting scammed. The only pressure to buy anything from anyone is in your head. You can flat out say no, hold your position, and done. Bethesda isn't making you do anything. They're not holding a gun to your head and making you buy from them. They're simply putting out their wares, offering a premium currency for those wares, and stepping back as people make their own decisions on. 
---
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.
---
I don’t know if it’s “in game” but in the camp build menu there is an Empty Pumpkin Rack that me or none of my friends seem to have and people are looking to buy on XBox LFG.
---
Yep. This game is always willing trick the buyers instead of treat them. The limited time items and bundles for items already sold separately are horrible. Luckily I was already aware of their tricks from creation club in Fallout 4. I like to play reverse Pokemon with their paid content and my goal is to collect none of them instead of all of them. 
---
I'm still sitting on my 4,800 free earned atoms and my goal is to never redeem them. I'd love to see them try to release something amazing enough to get me break that stance.
---
There are a lot of disabled gamers out there. Accessibility is a vital component to gaming. And it doesn't take much to take these folks into consideration. Color blindness settings, closed captioning, left handed control options (no I'm not listing this as an example of disability), etc.
---
I choose option 3: It happened.  You can claim whatever you feel like, I was there, and it sickens me to see players griefing other players, especially what is obviously a new player.
---
If I wanted to bring it up because I was the one being attacked, I would just say that (and have).
---
The game already stops you, through built-in event attrition. Go try to take over every workshop.  Let me know how far you get, because it won't be that many.
---
I crash Everytime I try to blow up a car or if I die
---

---
Legendary spawn chance is already low... what are you doing to get 40 legendaries a session?
---
Okay. Sorry about that.
---
And I was trying to tell the player to just leave.  He eventually did, soon after the other player had also dropped off.
---
The point is, it's a broken set up right now, as it enables this type of behavior.
---
Haven't crashed once.
---
I picked up mine today at the Brotherhood vendor in Whitespring
---
Following the same farming routes I've been using for months. And doing events.
---
You'd think that but early one of the two founders pushed the other one out. Zenimax is cold, and cutthroat. Donald Trump's younger brother is on the board of directors. I have a feeling nepotism, and cronyism are key factors at Zeni-beth
---
On PC you can just click "Respawn" and it will let you respawn at WS or whatever is nearest
---
You don't quite seem to understand. The way subscriptions (to any game) is handled on the PS4, is that you get a seperate tab for subscriptions and you can only cancel (auto-renewal) or renew them from there. The problem here is that the subscription is not awarded but the money is taken. The subscription is registered with Bethesda without any way of cancelling it, because Sony provides the platform to handle subscriptions to any service. 
---
So people are FUCKED because they can not cancel auto-renewal because it does not show up in the Sony services list, but Bethesda is authorized to charge a monthly/yearly fee through their own billing process.
---
How long is a session? And are you server hopping like a mad man?
---
Lmao. Thanks pal for your nothingness input, I didn’t ask anyone to reply. They’re justifying them fucking the fan base and not answering lol. Go suck off Todd you zuckerburg fanboi.
---
Dude, that sucks. I hope things get better for all of you.
---
Thanks. Come by for free candy or stimpacks
---
People who have bought the game are no longer prioritised/regarded as paying customers if they dont have 1st?
---
If you die at just the wrong time it won’t on PS4, you just keep spam clicking and nothing happens. Can’t bring up friends list or do anything, the camera just spins and spins.
---
To be fair, you don't need to be drunk to shit yourself.
---
Cod is pay to win because I lag on my 2002 tobisha.
---
It is pretty much non existent(melee damage bug) also, vats doesnt crash my game with melee on private.
---
Thats a microsoft problem though, just ask the support team.
---
He posted this 15 hours ago, at that time they hadn't commented there.
---
I've been a little under the veather....I've been COFFIN all day!  
---
AH AH AH AHHHH!
---
I paid for a Tv, an xbox one S, this game, xbox live, my internet service, and the controversial fallout 1st.......youve paid an incredible amount to play this game really.
---
   Go outside
---
People will complain just to complain. Kind of like the people who still ride the hate train on this game yet have never played it.
---
Obvious now that you've pointed it out.
---
How is it meeting the middle.  There are 22 PVP locations currently. You want to cut that down.  How is that meeting in the middle?  
---
Instead of saying take away the 22 PVP areas, why don’t you ask for them to allow group CAMPs? 
---
&gt;Please tell me a suggestion that has been offered by those who like PvP that addresses the problems so there can be a PvE build area while keeping PvP? Because so far all I've seen is "Don't change it!"
---
It’s called your CAMP
---
We had over 20 threads on DestinyTheGame yesterday bitching about eververse economy / festival of the lost item economy. Guess what happened? The community managers commented and indicated that they were collecting all the feedback, that it was very helpful, etc.
---
They didn't run away from the seething masses like a bunch of wimps.
---
Granted, on Bungie's part, they tend to take feedback into account and make changes where necessary, and this has been backed up in past actions. The absolute lack of communication based on community response is indicative of Bethesda having zero intention of taking feedback and/or making any changes at all.
---
No, it’s more akin to Thanos and Scarlet Witch.
---
I haven't crashed on PS4 but I can say its rather frustrating that shooting the legendary bot only seems to register half the time to loot it...
---
Honestly I'm debating buying it right now but that would have sold it for me hand down
---
excellent suggestion +
---
If this is a thing than it would explain the mysterious disappearance of my Zealot's combat chest armor. Scratching my head over that one since I could not figure out how I "lost" it. I'm on PC.
---
Chumoosh on ps4. I’m selling 2 in my vendor.
---
To even call them community managers is a bit disingenuous. They aren't allowed to manage the community at all. They are just PR mouth pieces, I am sure much to their individual displeasure.
---
Ditto on Xbox. Three of us had this happen at the same time. I ended up having to restart the game, though I made it back in time for the rewards. Our second run, he and several others died and got stuck and unable to respawn when the sentry exploded. I was far enough away to not die, so I got rewards and they did not.
---
I love that the go to is to yell shill at someone who doesn’t agree with you.
---
Yeah, now. Look at when the OP posted vs when bethesda started replying to other comments. At the time of their posts they were correct.
---
On average, it's crashed 2 out of 10 times. Let's not hope you get a double header! LOL. But ya, when there's a lot of people, things exploding and you try to interact with an object like lighting a pyre or a candy bowl, I almost expect it to blue screen on me. Good ole Bugthesda!
---
lol I got this as a gift for christmas. Have fun holding it with a hot beverage inside and cleaning it afterward.
---
Lmao! I find this to be funny. Thank you for the treat, I  didn't get the other evening. 
---
I am kind of conderdictiting my self, 
---
after I said I was done with the game. 
---
I decided the other night to jump on for an hour, because before all of the controversy over the Fallout first, and my main reason for leaving was for this exact reason, the game constantly being broken. I have had enough of the Bullshit.
---
 A month ago, I was really interested in doing something for Halloween. I put together my costume, I wanted to be a mix of Dr. Satan, and Texas chainsaw massacre. I made a flaming chainsaw, with the mod I had put away for about 6 months.  
---
I honestly wanted to walk away from this game on my terms. As I said before I only was planning on playing for 1 hour and living out my Halloween fantasy.  
---
The truth be told, I was going to chase low level players around with my chainsaw. Lol. I know it's kind of mean, I had no intentions of hurting anyone, and who knows, I would have probably gotten my ass handed to me for doing that.  Lol. 
---
After logging in I checked the map, to find my first victim, to try and scare the living day out of them, and there was maybe 6 people in total on the server, I honestly felt a little awkward seeing this, I have never seen a server this empty before. 
---
I assumed that most people were playing on private servers, and maybe others were just fed up with all the B.S, and where just backing off, as I had planned. 
---
I gave up, and server hopped, to continuously find the same average of players. Then I finally hit the Jack pot. There were about 13 low level players at Whitesprings, I assumed for the Halloween event.
---
 I ran to the roof of the Hotel, and stood there, firing up my chainsaw, looking down below at my new found victims.
---
 I waited for the event to start, and then proceeded to jump off the roof firing up my chainsaw all the way down. A few of the players, where standing there starring at me with a third eye.
---
 I began my pursuit, and chased after them. Chasing them all over Whitesprings, well they did the event. 
---
We got to one of the cottages, and all of a sudden. I became the victim of Bethesdas trickery, with out any treats. 
---
The moral of this story,  I lived out my fantasy for all of 5min, and then all of sudden the game crashed. 
---
I wish everyone the best, and I hope everyone has wonderful Halloween. 
---
Trick or treat, smell my feet, now  give me a game that doesn't crash every 10min consistantly!
---
**shocker**
---
Tell me everything there is to know about this “Joe” person
---
What the hell is TPing?
---
Right? I think I could pull off 40 legendaries (probably 5-6 being 3*) in like 2-3 hours of Whitesprings, harper’s ferry, and westek while also going to SBQ or encryptid events.
---
I read on the bug roundup the empty isnt dropping. Ill see if i can find it
---
It is a cash grab because all the DLC (except atom shop and a few other things) has been free for the most part. So they need money to keep putting things into the game. And I agree some of the features would have been nice for everyone to enjoy, but I can't imagine a server full of players with endless amounts of junk loading in being very stable. I mean look at all the complaining about crashes now.
---
Bruh I've been wearing costumes and still getting hats and shit
---
Playing the game for 4 to 8 hours a session
---
They have broken promise after promise after promise. 
---
Plans change. But discussing them in an honest manner, up front, and before things happen is how you win over hearts and minds.
---
Slapping pay2win rewards in a cash shop, and then putting even more pay2win functionality behind a monthly fee, something that was not disclosed or discussed whatsoever until it went live, functionality that actually fixes problems with the base game - its scummy and slimy and horrible.
---
Bethesda is basically behaving like a corporation from The Outer Worlds at this point.
---
Yep, I see what you mean. Bounces back and forth on me at a some locations (WS, Sunnytop), but not others! (West Tech, the Halloween event)
---
How much?
---
26-30 do not support
---
Perhaps a link to a polling platform would be more appropriate? The fact that it’s not a blind poll with replies visible will introduce bias whether intentional or not.
---
Well, 100% of your daily recommended sugar intake. They are definitely not bitter.
---
Plus they come with Captain Cosmos decoder rings /s
---
What system are you on? I'm going to be looking for a group to occupy mine.
---
Maybe. But people also say this game should never have existed and I dont feel like that is true. I've had a ton of fun playing this game whether it be alone or with friends.
---
It's not on the levelled list for the Mischief Night rewards, so it should be impossible to get.
---
Anyone who is saying they have it, please post a screenshot within the Build menu as proof.
---
I did it 10 times without crashing at all then today I’ve crashed 3 times. Someone pops a car &amp; I freeze 🙃 It’s whatever as it happened early so I just restarted my game quickly &amp; joined another world with the event still up. Just unfortunate
---
I honestly feel for the people working hard to make new content for this game and keep it alive. They give it all they got and the people playing just complain and whine.
---
Tried it once lagged my nuts off then died and couldnt respawn. My friend (the only other person I know that still plays)  managed to get the firefighter outfit I wanted first try so, I'll probably not do the event. Love this game or atleast I love what it could be. Not sure I love what it is
---
Yup, it's just terrible marketing. Not something I will support.
---
Just like people still hate on this game and try to kill it off even though some of them have never played it.
---
ok
---
I think its when Americans through loo roll in peoples gardens and trees
---
They really need something soothing and holiday-themed, IMO. Not like a Christmas tree or anything like that, but just something that suggests the pioneer theme and coming together through hardship and maybe even a whiff of winter.
---
There's enough intensity in this community these days without logging into a main menu screen that's all about fiery warfare lol.
---
Yeah, I get 1* items so often from her.  You spend like a thousand 556 ammo, half your weapons durability, and you end up getting a ghoul slayer’s trapper right arm
---
&gt; Bugthesda: please sort it out! 
---
\&gt;Complain about game  
---
\&gt;Slander company in a large complaining post  
---
\&gt;Expect change
---
10/10
---
I mean it does keep your progress as for weapons and armor transfer that's something everyone wants anyways but besides the ladder I dont understand still by save progress when the games save everyone's progress when they log in and out
---
Yea I agree and I do feel like the price is a bit much.
---
I have taken over several and was able to defend them all. This was way before pvp became a problem with them. The only reason i did was for the plans you get for rewards. I never built on them nor collected resources from them. I can farm way faster than any workshop can provide.
---
Workshops were never meant for base style building. 
---
They were meant to be taken over for resources and to build defenses to protect such resources. Basically a pvp base/battlezone.
---
The fact that there are no persistent worlds supports that. Your build gets destroyed when the server resets.
---
are enn gee
---
I’m sorry. I don’t remember. I’ll check when I get home from work. But negotiations are always welcome.
---
This is a bad place to do this. In general a majority of the playerbase is not on this sub.
---
It's accurate. The Empty Pumpkin Rack is shown in the Build menu, and the Plan for it is in the game data, but Bethesda didn't put the Plan on the levelled drop list for the event, so it's impossible to drop.
---
It's pretty rational to respond to complaints from players purchasing a service, and it's not like Bethesda was responding to tons of posts before FO 1st anyway...
---
Some people are really trying to hard to twist reality and keep the pain train pushing into Bethesda's rectum. &gt;\_&gt;
---
well the issue is that i was trying to repair it too 200% however it doesnt show up in the workbench at all
---
Event is super fun, completed it about a dozen times and I've blue screened 1x after loading in. Explosions in my experience has nothing to do with anything. I'm on ps4 BTW
---
Maybe. Either way people would still complain and whine like you said.
---
Shh...they'll charge ya 500 atoms for your idea.
---
You can also find enough pumpkins in the backyard of the house itself, given you have green thumb. There are two plants on the back of the building and three others a little over some hills between Pumpkin House and the Vault.
---
Whereas a blind internet poll tends to attract trolls.
---
My favorite was getting a 1* bloodied handmade from the SBQ.
---
Lmao, yes the X-Box performance issues are pay 2 win.
---
You need to create a more substantial poll with votes and responses hidden.  Or most of the people you want to hear from will not take this.  
---
You also need to look at your age ranges.  31 and over is way too broad as the spending habits of millenials, gen x and boomers are far different from each other.  
---
You should do 31-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56+ to get a better demographic
---
They’ve already said they’re thinking about giving us the ability to do it. I know they say that a lot but this is a basic plant we would be able to grow probably won’t be hard to implement &amp; they know we want it. Just wished it came with the event but I’m sure it’ll come
---
Also, i made it completely out of paper mache, took me a few weeks to do!
---
How?
---
Where did they say this? I have never heard them say that
---
24 dont support Blizzard ok with 1st
---
Session for me is typically 6 to 8 hours. And nope. I just know where to go. Also I've got 2300+ hours in the game so experience tells me where to go and what's best to do.
---
I would be perfectly ok with this actually.
---
No clue, I don't play on console, just talked to people who do. Probably somewhere in the settings on the dashboard.
---
i agree with everything youve said, to people with an iota of critical thinking it would seem obvious with the timing of the releases you are correct.
---
and yeah, alot of people blindly defend things for no reason, as if they get offended if you criticize predatory marketing of a company they have "aligned" with... as if that company gives a hit about any customer after they get their money
---
it is kind of fascinating how tribal humans still are, people get behind  asprts team and all other teams are SHIT and anyone who doesnt like their team is like an enemy, same with lots of "brands" i.e coke vs pepsi, ford vs chevy etc etc
---
fanboys lock onto something and freak if anyone threatens their bubble
---
this revelation often triggers said fanboys to attack anyone who questions their beloved franchise
---
Seen it in a big thread about not having the ability to plant pumpkins, BGS responded. I can try &amp; find it &amp; link it to you but it might take a bit I forget how long ago that post was😂
---
“Celebrate mischief night next week”
---
So...this was the ITV they didn’t want to put out last week for fear of looking tone deaf. So now they just put it out this week and didn’t bother to fix the headline. This is getting pathetic. I love this game, community and I’m still cautiously hopeful for the future—but Bethesda has earned every ounce of embarrassment it’s getting right now.
---
Do better. Change your ways. Fix your shit.
---
im on ps4 and got fo1st, but definitely better performance in private worlds
---
How is that pay to win?
---
Yeah if you find it please link it! I wanna see
---
To be honest - good riddance if Zenimax disbands Bethesda. Sometimes you have to cut off the finger to save the arm as they say.
---
Third time being when you join a friends private server then yeah? Cheers!
---
No. Bethesda has not earned more money at this point. Pay them when they deliver on content and keep their promises.
---
31+ Do NOT support.
---
However!
---
I support micro transactions for cosmetic items 100%
---
Even mods, to a certain extent. Lvl appropriate, of course.
---
I don't support P2W personally because that devalues the experience of those who cannot afford it or want to properly experience a game.
---
I also don't support making people pay more for things when a game is half broken. 
---
Goodwill goes a long way.
---
My 2 cents.
---
I'm sorry that Bethesda urinated all over your Cheerios, but as much as I mightn't like the idea of Fallout First or what they think they have to offer (*Which isn't much of anything*), I'm not going to hold it against the people that are just playing the game and enjoying themselves as they're meant to be doing.
---
If you're just playing the meta? Yeah. It's a boring as taffy game. If you *make* it something fun and something extra? Then bully on you for pulling it off and finding something to enjoy.
---

Found it! They said they brought it up to the team &amp; will let us know if they have updates but I’m holding out hope! I want to mass produce some pumpkin pie😋
---
I’ve looked around, I’m on a Xbox one X and there is no setting in 76 for it
---
Yeah I know I’m probably beating a dead horse here :/
---
I guess we can throw it into the massive list of things that the community nearly unanimously wants fixed but will be ignored. Right alongside the trade glitch and invisible ghouls!
---
For me every time my game has frozen up there has been am explosion covering at least half of my screen
---
It isn't in the game, it is in the dashboard. Look at the links I shared, they show you exactly where to go.
---
Yeah I know. It takes the same amount of time to switch servers real quick, so I only do that haha.
---
Me too! I want a pumpkin patch 😍
---
This poll will be biased simply due to the typical age of Reddit users.
---
Fallout 3 was pretty good.
---
Not enough to kill a sentry bot tho
---
No, two times in adventure mode then once in a private world.
---
yeah.. and it works the opposite way too...
---
whats your point?
---
Like any game fallout 76 has problems but the biggest problem is consistency with the fandom they never know what to be happy or mad about
---
At this point, anyone who touches Starfield is a fool. Hell, I'm willing to bet all the crap we're dealing with now, is just to help fund that damn game.
---
They literally already have the means to save items that can't be used anymore. This can be observed with broken weapons on the favorites bar.
---
Controversial products is to broad for me. I will say do not support based on your verbiage but I do support Fallout First.  
---
26-30 - Do not support
---
This reminds me of the red dead redemption fiasco back when this game first came out. It's sad seeing so many trolls (people going out of their way to put other people who actually like the game down by labeling them masochist or hoping on youtube to make an hour and a half rant video that recycles the same handful of half-baked facts) going out of their way to harass this game; if you don't like the game that's fine and good. Having opinions on how to make the game better or disagreeing with bestheda decisions, also fine; but crying about it for a year while sending replies to people who like the game an essay about Bestheda's greed and how 76's poor game design is while insulting the individual or re-directing new potential players to other games after allegedly quitting the game and moving on to a better game over a year ago, just seems "suspicious" to me.
---
this ended well...
---
This is such a #2 thing to do always stinking the place up.
---
Got ya, finish it quick, change servers, complete again then switch to private. Decent.
---
you do know there was already one in the game before this one right?
---
Yes, that's right. But in between the expansion packs, which come every 2-3 years, there's a ton of free new content. Their cosmetics are also cool-looking and inexpensive. That makes the players happy.
---
in before the delete
---
Also the jack o lanterns you get to place in your camp dont even have candles in them? Cmonnnn
---
JK... just happened again walking past the fire station with nothing happening around me..
---
In general, make sure you're using the latest drivers for your video card, and consider turning down the "shadows" detail setting in Fo76 &gt; Video to see if there is any performance improvement.
---
Wow man that was actually a somewhat constructive conversation until you call somebody a stupid asshole for trying to talk about your disagreements...
---
That sounds like you either have a very bad temper and don't like to consider your own opinions wrong, or you're a right arrogant prick.
---
There's a lot on PS4 too. Looks luke it's doing well.
---
I feel your pain. Anytime I try to use my pipboy during the event on PC my game freezes and i have to reboot my PC. Its very frustrating.
---
Yeah well said
---
At least troll on your main instead of a sock puppet account.
---
If they haven't released player numbers I doubt we'll see this.
---
lmao you guys are such a bunch of fucking suckers
---
This reminds me of when Project Paradise was introduced -- many players, especially on consoles, would crash in the elevator.
---
I mean I will give them some benefit of the doubt if I see stellar reviews from reputable sources, YouTube, twitch streamers etc. If it's 90+ metacritic, at least 8+ from user reviews, there are no microtransactions, and it's not using an iteration of Gamebryo (or it's stable, looks modern and runs as well as The Outer Worlds is running on my 4year old machine at 1080p) then I will give it a chance. Otherwise it can get fucked.
---
Except it will be put on other forums and video games have a younger demographic anyways
---
I know how it works, I promise.  I just sit in the q for over every time so I quit trying.
---
That’s because everyone waits to see what someone else says and just goes with it.  The hive mind at work
---
It is a sample size.
---
31 and WAY over, fully support 
---
...and there’s nothing “controversial”, nothing is free in this world... nothing.
---
31+ support
---
17-20 support
---
That’s a really good point
---
If the pacifist owns the workshop, and they're standing in it when somebody tries to take it, then yes.  If you don't own it, and you're just walking around, then no.
---
You need to define “Controversial products”. Everything is controversial to someone.
---
Server lag sometimes doesn't activate the stim in time so we die more easily. I've been experiencing this since about Patch 13 with my Excavator Medic torso.
---
Yeah, but I think New Vegas was better...
---
Oh... right.
---
yes please!
---
8 max players with no one world hopping makes a huge difference!
---
I was thinking that but figured certain age groups such as 46-55 would be barren or misleading due to not a bunch of people in that age range would play.
---
Oh I didn't. It was meant as a terrible joke.
---
Max 8 players and no one is hopping worlds makes a huge difference
---
Damn dude, I honestly feel sad for you.  You probably got your ass spanked by somebody in game and assume every pvp player is a toxic fuck.  Maybe you can grow past it one day.. :c
---
Incorrect, they were able to log in, just not get onto private servers. Do YOU even play the game?
---
Some people can afford better internet connection too.  ITS ALL PTW OMFG!!!
---
Yeah, yeah, screw off
---
Headless ghouls
---
Links weren't allowed and oddly enough, free survey sites do not allow a question to be followed by another. So every site I went to would be a question of age and then support or not with no way I could see of seeing the ages of support.
---
The Howard clan runs deep my dude
---
Of all the posts requesting text chat in the past year, this is the best.
---
If you've ever actually tried to participate in hunter/hunted instead of telling other people to use it, you'd know there's hardly ever 4 people willing to play it on a single server of 32 people.
---
The average wait time is at least an hour, and I'm not gonna bother with that.
---
It probably won't until it's below 100%. I don't have it but I have experienced this with the Blade of Bastet, it caused a momentary panic because I thought I had somehow lost or scrapped it  until I exited the bench and saw it was still in my inventory. Lol
---
I feel like this in particular is really easy to fix by using the rumble(easily fixed by bethesda I mean)
---
I feel you. I doubt they will add more health on the poor guy. It’s a one star so you aren’t missing too much. You likely will find 2-3 other stared legendary ghouls while doing the event in general. And have better odds of getting something more useful.
---
Bethesda is a fucking joke LOL
---
I don't think enough people saw this, it's still happening -.- lmao
---
Simpsons reference!
---
It's been an issue for more than half a year (multiple PCs). What works for me is to assign the food/drink to a favorite slot and consume from there.
---
Was about to reply this too, can’t have a poll on something unquantifiable.
---
It's super laggy, bit I haven't had it crash on me. 🤞🏻
---
It's your ISP.
---
If you mean the Fire Breathers uniform or Responders Firefighter uniform that's not the one I'm referring to - I mean the plain yellow uniform
---
People like you are the reason Todd Howard has a triple story yacht!
---
I was thinking about this yesterday, actually.  If they wanted to keep it console friendly (just plug a $10 keyboard into your console...), there could also be a set of common phrases selected from a dialog wheel.  Like "Let's group up!" "Want to trade?" "Follow me" etc.  Even if they were pretty spartan, just having them to select like a second emoji wheel, but you know, actually fucking helpful?
---
You are a sheep and you probably dont bathe much!
---
31+ Do not support. I don't mind cosmetic mtx, but p2w in a paid game I do not support.
---
My costume is an arsonist! *Burns your house down* I also really like to RP as my character.
---
You can hack consoles which can give you a view of the map for 30. He/they + teammates arent around any consoles so what gives?
---
D:
---
I aim better if first person. Run around in third for a better view. Other than that it’s a lot of shit luck unless you run with people you know or play with a lot.
---
I say good things, and deserved things...but, I don't rent digital nothings.
---
Go afk solo
---
That still makes it a biased, not statistically valid sample.  I’m 40 and play video games, I just happen to be on reddit.  
---
My buddy is 45 and also plays video games, he doesn’t use reddit.
---
Likewise. I've enjoyed Nuclear Winter since it was added, but I am absolutely awful when it comes to PvP in Fallout 76. So far, my strategy is to keep grinding to get small amounts of 25 XP in the first 30 seconds of a round, lmao.
---
Suggestion: try playing another game, like the Outer Worlds. You might have more fun than FO76.
---
So you want to go against COPA and ask underage kids to disclose their age?
---
Reported.
---
Game should have came out summer next year with everything and wastelanders in as the base game . I feel this entire mess would been somewhat avoided.
---
If Fallout 76 was a single player game, I would have uninstalled within the first day of playing it.
---
I know Todd said "you can play by yourself" but when you do, all you get is holotapes, bots, and monitors to read text off of.  No actual interaction, no different mission outcomes that define who your character is...
---
Playing this game as a singleplayer game makes this feel like a hollow shell of Fallout 4, with quests that have 1 ending and no way to define who your character really is other than wearing clothes of your faction of choice.
---
It is and I should've specified I plan to do a poll for other controversies in games. This would be strictly for FO76/1st but after it will be combined to paint a rudimentary picture to see if age plays a role in opinions on things like this.
---
I just finished doing it 140 times, only got the plasma mine plan, it's such a pain in my butt, I'd just trade my AAe handmade for it if I could.
---
Ooof, thanks for the tip. I'll equip fireproof on my next run for sure
---
Yes human psychology is just that simple
---
I'm not a FO 1st member. because I choose too. I think you should choose to move on to another game and quit shitting on people, you sound entitled, I mean young.
---
What? Age ranges for surveys but sure, make it weird 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I'm confused did you post your method somewhere?
---
Dude, I have the first xbox1, and I have yet to crash or lag out during the event, so its just not it
---
I agree with you completely.
---
It'd keep the pve'rs from complaining, and let pvp'rs have somewhere to pvp without tossing all their loot they've grinded and played for out the window, just to play NW and regrind for more perks.
---
your loss , i sell amazing items
---
I guess I maybe underestimated the ranges, I just didn't want like 3 people in a range making it seem like 100% of people in that range feel one way or another
---
my assumption of the divide is not along generational gaps but more along the lines of how many games the person actually plays. fallout is one of those weird well known games that also has a sorta cult like following. folks who play a lot of games are generally against hyper monetization. these 400 rank 76'ers log into this game every day for hours. i don't know what they do...but over the past year...seems like nothing they wouldn't support at this point as long as it has a fallout logo on it.
---
Don't randomly accept trades. I don't carry around stuff I wanna trade anyway so it's pointless. You know for a fact they are gonna pick your best stuff.
---
This would be a cunt move, hope they don't do that.
---
I mean, if you know the meaning of mischief night, nuking should be considered the ultimate prank, so I definitely approve.
---
I only buy from joe
---
I hate it more when people put camps there and AFK.
---
No, I’ve looked through some of these guys comment history, they only respond to negative feedback with defences of Bethesda. Don’t know how someone can claim to be objective while spending all day defending Bethesda against valid criticism online....
---
They’re shills that don’t even get paid.
---
I've had to close the game each time, and if I'm solo I can't even get back into the same server to check for rewards/loot the sentry. I do better on my sniper char. keeping some distance from the boys than my melee who is forced into the fray. Frustrating!!
---
umm...ok good for you
---
Yep, cross fingers and keep trying, server jump like you've never server jumped before.
---
Yeah usually when somebody in the conversation gets their diaper full and starts whining and insulting people, it means their argument holds no weight and they're upset because they're wrong.
---
:)
---
real camps should take priority over peoples survival tents
---
That’s what I figured haha, but thought I’d ask!
---
why , you can still buy from the shop whats it matter if the player is there or not?
---
oh ok then
---
I also hate how when you favorite regular stimpacks it is automatically the = key. Yet diluted and super handle like regular weapons.
---
Not so clever, are you?
---
they shouldnt be in adventure at all.. they should be a feature of a private world only
---
Hide in a bush every time
---
Ah thanks.
---
Are you crazy that is literally what a marketing dept does...
---
AGREE x10,000!
---
No risk of junk loss either.
---
Savage.
---
Yea but if I meet a new person I have to add them. I dont add everyone I play with.
---
Its an old prank. It was just to inconvenience people like TP.
---
Or maybe if they fixed their game first and adopted a F2P model from the start instead of double dipping ?
---
Yeah but I use my best weapons, so the best option would be my guess to „shadow“ them out, so no one can see them in your inventory.
---
I had some bolstering pieces disappear, I logged out and back in and they were is my stash, idk if that works for everyone
---
fasnacht syndrome I call it.. these bosses should be spongier IMO..
---
I guess it doesn’t bother me but it’s 9/10 times over priced and bullshit. I think people need to realize shits not worth near what they think.
---
PSA For the challenge, you can also pick up pumpkins sitting around, like the shed at the fairgrounds
---
There is nothing I wanna trade them for so I drop them. I learn them if they are new but drop all extras. It's not like I'm ever gonna craft any of them.
---
At the time, I might have been.
---
Muy Bueno
---
I used to stash all my stuff when doing a trade off Reddit
---
This is the right answer.
---
Pay ~~2 Win~~
---
ok?
---
Exactly what I mean, thank you.
---
On survey sites, that make sure not to identify the user. 
---
You're on reddit and everyone who posts does so with their username, and you are asking for their age, for everyone to see.
---
There is a reason this is a point within COPA. Too many pervs out there.
---
Very good! If only we could've got the mask in game lmao
---
Idk, I got a lvl45 AA lever action for a cap from one of those vendors before. Even that one time thing makes camps infinitely preferred to tents.
---
The nearby raider camps sometimes spawn Scorched and if you are close enough to the ToW, killing them counts too.
---
Really? I only Eat At Joes...
---
14k for the skeleton costume!? Uhhhh... Ow. 
---
Your average of 140 seems generous. I may have to give up before starting.
---
or you know being mad at the fact they added a subscription service to a stand alone 60$ dollar game
---
You would be surprised.  the 46-55 range is the group that had the 2600 in their teens.
---
I haven't crashed yet . My strategy has been , hold down trigger on .50 cal while I waltz around following a robot , until everything is dead. Got the fireman outfit yesterday. And one extra fireman outfit ( body piece). No extra helmet yet. Still no sign of the pirate.
---
Thread removed.
---
Victory, once more, for America.
---
I have an normal Xbox one... only crashed once.
---
Clear your system memory up, either that or spend the event looking at the floor
---
The thing about outer worlds is that it isn’t multiplayer. That’s why I am/was invested in fallout 76. An open world game with multiplayer. :/
---
Honestly I only have mine up to help everyone who needs to quickly transfer to their stash. If it's blocking your camp, just message me (PS4) and I'll be glad to move it.
---
I tested some of the areas and it wouldn't register. Even the ones directly beside the Top of the World where the vendor is. I ended up getting it after a couple server hops
---
To check out the drama, neanderthal.
---
Wasn't that obvious? It is to every imbecile that defends Bethesda's every action.
---
Although I once had an interest in this game.
---
It's pretty ridiculous.
---
You only need to register about 150 damage to get credit for the kill, but you get these players who come screaming in with explosive weapons like they are going after the Scorchbeast Queen, and they don't stop firing until it's dead.  It's totally overkill.
---
I mean, it's a bloody 1*.  No one is impressed at your showing off.
---
Clean your consoles/pc's, vents and heatsinks (if you are out of warranty, break the seal and clean, replace thermal paste if it's dried out/cracking). Heatsinks can look like the lint filter in your dryer, especially if your console is 3 years or older, or have pets.
---
Patting yourself on the back for using two big words (For you) and a Latin praise. I'm not trying to win this argument by attacking you, because all I want to do is point out continually how utterly stupid you are, and each one of your responses just gratifies me, because however this interaction ends you're still a total idiot.
---
So infinite stash boxes actually affect server stability?
---
I would argue they were mostly easy due to double exp.
---
3k for the top VTU reward? I think? So really 1.5k with double exp weekend? I think I got it in 3 matches, mostly because I won my first and only match. 
---
14k seems downright impossible.
---
It's not like I am complaining that we don't have things, but occasionally it's nice to have little things like this thought about for us who struggle.
---
Of course, if you're net specced into PvP. Why even do it.
---
Option 3 was already the one where it happened to you so...
---
I mean for me I'm only going to have it for a little while before my subscription runs out. So moving it doesn't matter to me.
---
But they don't disappear like consumables.
---
Cheers, need to try this.
---
Give it 10 minutes and go to the whitesprings station, I've bought so many 1 star weapons for less than 50 caps... Easy scrip. Not to mention the fireman outfit I've bought from there too.
---
That never even occurred to me... man, now I really wish we’d gotten that
---
Mine is actually 1st gen. Dont have any paste around. 
---
I am farmiliar with having to do this though. Used to buy rrd 360's for dirt cheap and give them to less fortunate people with my brother in law.
---
IIRC, Atom Store items (the atom logo) are hidden from trade, so slap on a paint or appearance change, if you have any unlocked.
---
there is a stash box at whitesprings station already...
---
Gracias!
---
As a North-American, here I was thinking it was some obscure European tradition! :)
---
Lol, you’re precisely the person I’m talking about.  Go away.
---
Yeah, searched online and in game far and wide for one of these. Absolutely love it! Thanks!
---
Amen. I don't think I've ever bought anything from a ws station player vendor. They're crazy overpriced and always picked over and probably never had anything good to start with. Savage divide camps are where its at for me
---
Yep for my handmades that’s doing the trick but sadly not for my legacy plasma weapons
---
I love it on xbox because I can launch my self into the stratosphere with my X-01 jetpack
---
Yeah on one side of the station, and if you're overencumbered it helps a whole lot. I've many a people stop by just to put stuff in their stash. 
---
I like to drop them some junk in my junk box when they swing by too.
---
Only if you promise to stop spelling Whitespring wrong.
---
Use 3rd person camera. Overall, it smooths out most of my frames and makes lag manageable ime.
---
Old from when? Who has so many extra forks they can stick them in a lawn?
---
TP = Toilet Paper.
---
TP'ing being the act of throwing a toilet paper roll over someones trees/bushes/house/property to make a mess. 
---
It's hard to clean up because it tears apart easily.
---
The proper method , I learned when I was in high school. Under handed toss , up over the roof. High tree branches . Any yard decorations. Then turn on sprinklers , if available, if not use the water hose and mist everything down good.
---
Damn bethesda, get this man a jester mask in game!
---
I can only speak for me but yes.  To me, this alone is worth the price I paid.
---
So don’t subscribe.  It’s not a mandatory feature of the game.  If someone wants to pay for what amounts to just a time saver, what’s the issue?   Bethesda still has to fund this game and its servers.  I have yet to see anything they have put out which amounts to a true pay to win set up.  Everything so far has done nothing more than make it so you don’t have to spend as much time grinding junk.   There are no super weapons, no massive stat increases, no level jumps, nothing.  Just junk.
---
The TP stands for toilet paper.
---
Just like everything Bethesda does lately.
---
It's an inconvenient prank. You can't just vacuum 'em up or use the lawnmower, you gotta pluck every one. 
---
And from a prank standpoint, it's easy to execute.
---
Draw mole miners to it...lol
---
Like old old pranks from the 70s. You just go to your discount stores and buy out all their plastic utensils. Get a group of friends who also plunder the plastic pokers from their stores and begin the mischievious pranks.
---
You would use plastic disposable cutlery.
---
I’d expect PS4 to be the worst of the bunch but I’ve only had it crash once out of probably 10 runs now.
---
Cool, 20 people is a lot different than one you absolute genius you
---
Upvote this... over and over again.
---
PLUS, even if you don't crash or lock up, or otherwise disconnect, some absolute nugget will nuke the area just before the event so he can giggle and shit himself, locking the event off from those who aren't able to get into power armor yet, and since no one can wear costumes, you won't be able to complete the damn event anyway.
---
You know who you are. You know what you did. 
---
Unless you do, but don't know what you did... Please don't nuke Whitesprings for the event, okay? Newbies are trying to participate, too.
---
I’ve heard this a few times... are people just hiding a lot?
---
They could have text chat if they wanted they could either wholesale copy the text chat mod that exists or cust copy the codebase from ESO's chat client which is actually top-notch.
---
But they don't maybe it'll be part of the mods later on or something or you have to have the subscription, either way, it wouldn't surprise me if they decided to charge for it because at this point why not.
---
Ugh, I've had that for a legacy weapon and a couple of other nice ones... I just walk away from unsolicited trades now, which of course causes people to shoot or punch for a while (mostly funny I suppose).
---
I had one guy follow me for nearly HALF AN HOUR begging over voice chat... it was downright bizarre.
---
I dont know if it'll help but I shared this on my Twitter and tagged Bethesda and their support page. Maybe they'll read it if they haven't already on here. You've got my support.
---
The one in a million chance is better than no chance at all.
---
Do you have to win to get the outfit or just run around and get xp and level up ?
---
Haha, thankyou!
---
Just xp
---
If I moved too far, like the ledge towards the Cutthroat camp or the vendor building, it didn't count for me either. However, standing underneath the ToW and shooting the Scorched further away in the Camps did work.
---
Ye,dem sumz a bishes got me wit dat one...
---
Kinda bummed me out,but I bought em both,
---
Wit In game earned atom points,
---
I didn’t buy dem shits.
---
But ye,still...
---
Bummed me out a smidge.
---
You take rolls of toilet paper, and throw then over houses and trees so that they spiral and the tissue drapes over the trees and stuff. If the morning dew is heavy, the tissue gets wet and clings to EVERYTHING making it a real bitch to clean up.
---
They did it wrong, I stay afk. Can't do much else.
---
good advice, thanks
---
there should be a way to get so called junk without subscribing, seeing how they said everything added would be free and for everyone. Reason why i bought the game when it came out. Its one thing to add junk and helpful time savers into the game in the store you can grind or buy. But the deliberate cash grab for QOL dlc is a dick move.
---
And I don't have a PC just console. Just some times it seems like errors happen in system files that can lead to more crashes on console. So doing a file restore deletes the corrupted files and replaces them with new one from the back up.
---
31 and over - against

I don't think skeleton is live yet. They've been unlocking at 1 a day and i think todays is pumpkin armour. Tomorrows is skeleton. You're on xbox though, so am i. DM me your gt and I'll invite you to the team if you want. I'm around level 120 or something.
---
It isn't broken. He was outmatched, and for some reason kept returning over and over again. No one forced him to. He brought it upon himself.
---
You can't. You have to pick them up in the world.
---
I chained my friends truck to a dumpster. Then create a fake work emergency so that he would haul ass. Another time I put zip ties all the way down the drive shaft of each one of my coworkers vehicles. Laughed so hard as they all took off to leave after work, pulling over like wtf is wrong with my car .
---
How so?
---
Can you just run around until you level up, what level does it unlock ?
---
There are pipes under Mama Dolce. Nobody ever goes there, it's the right spot to try and survive for as long as possible.
---
Plus they are in a pretty central spot so they very often survive the first few restrictions of the Ring of Fire.
---
Or conversely, stop putting them beside v9. My camp is a platform the queen lands on for easy killing. And it keeps the bloodied builds from getting wrecked by the hordes. When my camp doesn't load in I have to fight the queen, on the ground, like a sucker.
---
Maybe ask Bethesda to do something about it instead of the players. They have the ability to fix this problem.
---
Also look at gtao it came free with a paid game and is living of micro cash they could have done the same thing and avoided the pr disaster, and well lying to their consumers
---
Wait, I can get paid for this?
---
I just tried it, I see what people like about it even tho it lack in combat and honestly just movement lol.
---
I invested 1,6k/h in Fo76, doesnt mean I don’t play other games aswell. 🙂
---
 Agree to a degree. Although I think what they grew up with is a possible factor as well
---
Can some awesome Reddit'r make a post about a help needed/wanted flare i had to ask 9 diffrent players for help getting a pic infront of the pumpkin house and only one said yes but needed to run the Halloween event first so by then i had to log off ... What a chore 😒
---
What I hate are the vending camps at WS train stations selling grossly overpriced goods like 95% of the time.
---
Sorry if i am being rude but consoles are not that great for gaming. Sure, fallout 76 is pretty buggy and laggy at times but i run the game on a PC  i5-9600, 2070 and M2 type SSD with no problems at all . I can even run 2 accounts on same desktop. I would go on but probably you'll think i was hired by bethesda.
---
There's a puppy in the parlour, and a skillet on the stove. There's a smelly old blanket that a Navajo wove
---
Friend of my sister. They TPed our house. So we upped the game, and TPed theirs, along with forks and shaving cream. Expensive, sure, but worth it.
---
Good one :) Man people don't have a sense of humour here do they ..
---
I’ve lost a few rewards for sure on death crashes, go to respawn and poof main menu. Also has anyone been able to exit server post completion and join another one in time to get doubke rewards? By the time i load in it’s been x:08 oclock at the earliest but none of the temp decorations pop up for like two full minutes. This is also just what happens upon relogin after a server crash as well, thus my losses. But, for all i’ve lost, i did nail the pirate outfit just now, lets say 20 tries at most but closer to 14-15!
---
Thank you Perkiecet, that is much appreciated and your support is welcomed gladly
---
Funny how if they replied to this thread, it would still be 100% replies to Fallout 1st threads.
---
&gt;Just gotta say I am a level 50 and I get a couple shots in and can loot it "most of the time"... but I can tell you that people are rushing to kill it and then server hop. There is a chance to get double rewards/loot if you are quick enough.
---
All the runs I have done people are bunched up waiting for the legendary sentry bot to spawn and everyone piles in as soon as it starts glowing green. 
---
Always seems to be a 1\*.   There are too many players there so no one is going to hold back for fear of missing out.   Would be good it legendary enemies did not take damage until fully formed.
---
There will always be some people that rush every events just because they're bored.
---
I agree.
---
They damn well better not. As someone who's been playing since December, it would be a serious kick in the bag to give it to someone who just started playing the game who feels like spending $10/mo is no big deal.
---
Netflix
---
No problem hopefully they'll implement it at some point, the sooner the better.
---
Those drops belong to the player that requested it? I never knew that.  I've taken stuff from drops that I never called in and nothing has even happened. Often I put stuff them in as well.
---
Wow, that's savage
---
Tried it four times at night and only completed it twice. Even at 4am it crashed.
---
What's worse, I can't make progress with any quests in the game due to all the high level enemies spawning. Just hit level 25 and I'm facing off against a dozen level 62 charred and feral ghouls at Whitesprings. Tried going to the Blackwater Mine and it's nothing but level 40 Glowing Mole Miners.
---
Google's survey platform can do precisely what you want. Same too with Survey Monkey. All you need to is look.
---
Also, those age brackets are ridiculous. What's up with 31+, like the different brackets there don't mean anything?
---
Same here. I use one character and switched like 3 different builds during my 330+ levels since BETA.
---
Also, I always keep a Tesla rifle on me to tag enemies. Its invaluable in things like Uranium Fever too!
---
My first thought was that some bethesda bots or something posted that they had no crashes just to make bethesda not look terrible, but then i realized why wouldnt they just say they had no issues at all. Basically my frustration at Bethesda came out as me thinking they were getting bots to write good things about the game lol
---
Is there proof of this just for peace of mind?
---
31+ I don't support
---
I played way too many MMO's that went p2w at some point. Which usually meant that no new players start the game or even if they do they drop when the certain barrier was reached. This is slowly killing the game and I refuse to take part on it.
---
But I do support cosmetic only mtx.

---
Don’t forget about dead enemies that never respawn when plasma guns are used, and the repeating audio bug from sentry bots that loops endlessly until your ears bleed and you get tinnitus.
---
Oh there have been issues almost universally. Just not a crash issue.
---
i'd be interested to see if that did. just from personal experience I've seen no correlation to age. generally it seems like fallout has an older crowd. plenty of 50+ players here. My general take: if it's the only game they play this week then they're pro almost any monetization to include subs/p2w/etc, and if a person plays several games this week they'll view hyper monetization as shady/generally off-putting. But if you get a good sample be sure to share the info here.
---
I can deal with most bugs but if the server crashes and i lose progress thats a no from me dawg

I’d upvote this post 1000 times if I could.  My sister is deaf and it pisses me off that there is no chat feature in this game for her to utilize. Honestly Bethesda, please listen to your fans who can’t enjoy the game to the full extent.
---
lol, this is can be used to your own favor.

😂

Holy Shit dude, you know you can turn off your quest tracking in the pip boy?

Selling a game for full price, then strangle holding gameplay elements behind a paywall so you can make another quick buck is complete shit.
---
I hope you get a response from Bethesda for your post. At the most cynical level, it's a PR layup but it's also just the most decent thing to do for a customer who is making a perfectly reasonable request.
---
I hope this comes through for you.
---
Morgan Town Airport also has some.
---
When you spawn in, turn left towards the Airport runway. It'll be on your left side as you approach.
---
Sorry I have to disagree; Bethesda keep this jam on repeat and crank up the bass boost.
---
I really mean like the option to switch between them like if u want NW u have that if u want main theme u have that too
---
Never mind the mask, how bout that gun!
---
A little cleaning goes a long way, just do what you can atm until you get some paste. Just be careful not to stress anything on the board.
---
i hope they do it too so this dumpster fire spills into skyrim
---
I am SOOOOOOOO pleased to see this post. OP thanks for posting, legend! 
---
I did one today and all was fine until the 2nd and 3rd attempts which also as you know means waiting an hour each time. Both lagged in high combat areas, where either the game froze or simply crashed. RIDICULOUS! 
---
I ended up quitting as I'd had enough and played another game. 
---
N.B I'm playing on PS4 Pro.
---
Yeah, tbh she is pretty dirty. Cats dogs and stuff
---
How do you know
---
A least do a google form dude
---
It could be that there was an existing drop there and that yours hadn’t landed yet. Or it could be a glitch.
---
Or the awesome nocturnal rolling pin.
---
I suck at NW, really want to unlock the Pumpkin Combat Armor paint tho. My strategy was to play a few rounds each night for the week to hopefully earn it, but that doesn't look feasible.
---
it releases 1 a day at 8pm est (ish)
---
Bethesda fan boys will tell you how this is normal in online games.
---
You're asking for a quality-of-life (QOL) change. FYI, the community has asked for many, many QOL changes over the year and very few have been implemented. So don't get your hopes up.
---
Then give up gaming because 90% of the games out there will have paid dlc, or be a game as a service going forward.    Production cost are to high, crunch is to long, and marketing cost money.   Next generation will be worse.
---
My camp is 3 caps NW of the Whitespring on a cliff, with a lead deposit. People camp.in that spit so frequently that about 25% of the time, it's taken when I load in. That's just the game. I just deal with it. It's a popular spot. If you're mad because you can't put your camp down, what makes you think you're more special or more important than the player who had THE EXACT SAME IDEA, BUT BEFORE YOU?
---
You fucking kidding me
---
That’s actually an OP and versatile weapon.  At night, it does more damage when you’re killing supermutants. But while you’re making baked goods during the day, you need to be more gentle, so it does decreased damage.
---
Same here and I'm on PS4 Pro.
---
You can get plenty of junk without subscribing, grind just like the rest of us.
---
*Sees like minded player aggressively praising Moth.*

Theres your problem: pistol build. 
---
Heavy or rifle or auto. You pick. 
---
Consider health buffing cards or defensive. Use every little thing.
---
the boss isnt the problem, the assholes are the problem.
---
the people that have the super over the top builds and OP weapons know full well that they are killing the bosses too fast and ruining it for everyone else.  thats why they do it.
---
Well if you want to get into lore only enclave members do and your character isnt exactly an enclave member at the start if the game. So theoretically anyone could gain access to the silos after doing a bunch of over glorified fetch quests
---
No I completely agree, this is something that should have been thought of. If you’ve ever played rdo they use 3 different ways of alerting you to nearby collectibles/treasure. They use visual, audio, and physical(rumble) to let you know you know your getting closer to the object
---
I’m the same, trust me, but just HIDE your ass off! Best advice I can give, hide and stay hidden. Fingers crossed we both get the rewards :-)
---
survival tents are not camps , they are free to place anywhere , and if one is in the area , dont need 3 more right next to it , they can all share the same junk box
---
I like your positive sentiments about not bickering and whatnot, but I disagree that the "I told you so" attitude doesn't help anything.   
---
If less people fall prey to these crappy business practices, then it'll encourage a better work ethic from the company. If people stop insta-buying new releases due to a troubled history, then the company will be much more inclined to perform their due diligence and actually start testing things before releasing them, especially if it's paid content.  
---
The only question left, is "which effect will the 'I told you so' attitude have on the playerbase?" For you, I'm guessing it would just encourage you to buy content faster, hoping to one day shoot down the nay-sayers with the single jewel in the pile of shit. For others, however, it may actually be productive in slowing their haste to buy half-assed, over-priced content, and in the end improve Bethesda's business model as a whole.  
---
I guess only time will tell, because it's not likely that anything or anyone on either side will change =\\
---
battling other vendors for the spot is bad enough , 1 outta 2 log ins its taken by another vendor , now its just always taken by the stupid survival tents
---
It's too much because a power armor skin costs more than the entire Far Harbor DLC for FO4. That's an astonishing lack of value.
---
If the prices were set lower, they'd sell more - they might make less on each item, but given the volume of items added to the store, they should be making more money overall.
---
This is the right confirmation.
---
Level 71 here
---
If possible: get frog legs and bloody mess
---
Preferably try to get either master shotgun, heavy gun or commando perk cards and look for your weapon of choice
---
Do not spawn on top of your team mates as there will be less loot for you both if you loot the same house/enclosed area
---
After looting in the beginning STICK to your highest level team mate, preferably the entire team, some are assholes, some are nice
---
All I know is when I play solo, the random level 3  or 4 thats stick with me has a higher chance of surviving, like if I manage to kill people then we both can get better gear. (If its not your kill its not your loot, unwritten rule! Let the killer loot first and then you can take the rests, especially with stimpaks, if the pvp guy has no stims; you both are probably gonna die soon) 
---
Staying close to eachother also works the other way around, if I lose a firefight then its nice to have a second chance with someone close
---
A nice way to know how far away you should be: try to always be atleast 20 feet away, that way if someone attacks him you can get to him in one full AP sprint 
---
If pvp isnt your style, try to get aquaboy and stick to water and just camp while hiding in deep water, or start close to the edge of the ring, then you can walk out and try to get the chameleon mutation (this is kinda risky since u lose alot of health, but if youre camping you dont need it. Also mutations are obviously random so you risk losing health for nothing) with the chameleon mutation always stay in the edge of the map and hide in bushes 
---
You most likely wont win like this, but can easily become top 10 or even top 3 or 2
---
Sorry for super long answer, this is just what I would reccomend, good luck! 
---
Ps: loot as fast as possible and move on, dont shoot too many npc enemies as people will hunt down the sound of gunshots!
---
If the only game impacting problem had to do with the 1st premium subscriber service, then what sort of responses did you expect.  I guess you've never worked in an IT department.  When production breaks, it's all hands on deck to fix it.
---
I don't really have a specific build in mind, so I'd definitely be open to suggestions. Mostly use ranged weapons over melee for what it's worth. And as for armor I usually just wear whatever has the most DR/DT for what I can equip--not too worried about being great at sneaking as most of the time I'm killing at range anyhow.
---
I'll be on in just a few, if you're playing.
---
NPCs dont attack survival tents lol , or i have never seen them try
---
Supposedly if it wasn't killed right away it grows to a 3 star. I don't know, people bum rush and hit it with everything this side of Jupiter before it even gets 1 star in some cases.
---
Someone else posted that it's not attainable. One of the dataminers
---
whitesprings train station , its not wrong lol , as in the train station that belongs to the whitespring
---
Can they be damaged then? 
---
Not really sure why someone would place it there anyways... does tent give players name? If so sounds like the Hunt is on...lol
---
If a tent is in your camp spot it should de-spawn. There are popular spots on resource nodes that people could plop a tent down on just to be a dick.
---
cant see who owns them so.... no way to message people on PC also...
---
Yeah i love the gun too, that was the only thing bought. Everything else was custom made!
---
Pay to Not Play
---
OH WOW ANOTHER BROKEN ASPECT OF 76?! /s
---
but seriously, how much more do some of you people need to experience before you're over this game? it's been out for AN ENTIRE YEAR and it still works like this. like.... move on from the game already. Bethesda doesn't know how to fix their games. at all.
---
Agreed.
---
I've done it several times without a single crash... Hell I even played it on my old laptop while visiting the fam and it still didn't crash.
---
where did ya come from where did ya go. id been married a long time ago , cotton eyed joe
---
Real vendors place at Pleasant Valley or just south of. 
---
Sometimes you can find good stuff in the Forest between 76 and Flatwoods too.
---
No, it is great when people are them up at SQB fights.  They just need to deapawnn them for CAMPs
---
its the mobile camp that pisses most of us day one folks that remeber hearing cosmetics only shop will keep this game going. I dont care about fo1 subscription sticking with cosmetics only, but it including CONTENT is what irritates me
---
While he is being extreme, I do agree with the idea that Wastelanders isn't going to be the giant game changer that people are making it out to be. Just based off of Bethesda's track record ever since Fallout 76 came out, I think at best its going to be a good expansion for those who still play the game, but I don't think it'll be the great gamechanger that makes all the people turned off by Fallout 76 finally like it.
---
It’s not about whether people bicker and debate on their own posts when they ask for it, and the “I told you so” mentality when people are arguing for it. It’s the fact that even when people are asking for help 99% of people are saying “You deserve it” and “I told you so” and “haha” etc. Comments that are not constructive for anything whatsoever other than to tear fellow players down for doing something that they wanted. No one deserves to be treated shitty either by a player base or the developers themselves. People need to drop their torch and pitchforks for five seconds, and realize that posting a douchebag comment instead of helping someone is absolutely contradictory to their cause. I understand how negative reinforcement works, but take it out on Bethesda and the ignorant, not someone who fucking needs help. That’s all I’m trying to point out to people.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dp7xj9/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_mischief/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Not sure if all of the items are here, but they do list out some atom shop release dates and previews of items:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3ikCA2Cdhfl09FNTxXFOAE/atomic-shop-update-14-items-and-sales-october-29
---
But it’s been it development almost half the time of 76 before it came out
---
Welcome to fallout 76.
---
That's wrong on two different levels.
---
If it's the train station that belongs to The Whitespring, then it still wouldn't be The Whitesprings Station.  It would be The Whitespring's Station.
---
But look at the sign.  What does it say?  https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/6/62/FO76_Whitespring_station.png/revision/latest?cb=20181221065040
---
Ive never once had a problem with crashes during the event...maybe your comp is the problem?
---
Read other comments about how I couldn't make it anything but 2 separate questions (or I couldn't figure out how to)
---
I agree that it needs to have its health tied to the number of players. 
---
I've had no problems tagging it.  But I run the event with a 50 cal explosive machine gun.  It counts even if I get splash damage from the exploding rounds.
---
The only advice that I can give you is to get a rifle with explosive legendary effect.
---
And no it doesn’t have any effect on me personally. I’ll do what I please. People talked all the shit on this game from the start, and I’ve been playing since beta. My opinions don’t get swayed by immature comments. The fact that people can’t be decent and help people when they need it is what discerns me.
---
What the actual fuck?
---
Whats the point of making a timed event reward unattainable
---
How is it griefing at a workshop again?
---
Ya, I'm like 4/9 completion. Sucks a whole bag of dicks.
---
Bethesda: That will be $59.99 please.
---
Code issue for the drop. Doubt it was intentional. Hopefully they fix or just make the plan available to everyone afterwards.
---
Just drop mines all around em.
---
I see the concern. I guess I didn't think of that potential. I attempted to use free survey sites such as survey monkey but my difficulty was that the free plan didn't include (or I couldn't figure it out if it did) ways to combine answers, such as I am x years old and support. It would have been results of say 50 people saying they're 18 and 50 saying they support and me not having any way of knowing which is which.
---
Sounds like he was the griefer here.
---
Certainly hope so, i really enjoy plan collecting.
---
Guess i can take it easy once ive got everything else apart from the empty rack from this event
---
True, I guess I should've specified more.
---
Okay 1ster
---
Have you gotten all the outfits too?
---
Ahh. Thank you!
---
Well if its vendors not gouging people selling rad x and poop then yeah I agree.
---
Yeah.  A little bit.
---
Yeah
---
On PS4 and just had my first server disconnect at the 6pm EST event. Right when the legendary sentry bot spawned in.
---
On PC, I crashed after the event both times last night while trying to fast travel out of the area.
---
You don’t want my .44 ammo for 3 caps per round???
---
I think that it might be an issue of too many players, with too much going on, in one area. I think that they might've been better off having two events, the one in Whitespring and one somewhere else on the map for lower lvl. players, like me, who gets DESTROYED by those damn Assaultrons and Ghouls. lol.
---
Please provide a link showing how to do that for free on there and I gladly will. 
---
My reasoning for the brackets was that I presumed age brackets that were like 45-50 would have maybe 2 replies and that would smear results to indicate that 100% of people in that range support or do not.
---
i lubs my overclocked 5960x :3
---
Uh, wasn't that the whole point to the atom shop? To sell microtransactions that would fund the rest of the game's development? I mean, they're already charging ridiculously high prices for cosmetics and selling multiple "convenience" items despite earlier promises. How much more money does Bethesda need to keep this game alive?
---
Lol I'll pass. Or better than that, 50 cal balls for 5 caps a piece.
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Um what? Your crashing issues could be unrelated to what console you're using. It could be the servers, or your internet, or what people have mentioned about the enhanced mode
---
No I have mine set up so random bots dont message me. They wouldnt be able to write back.
---
I've not seen them at SBQ yet. Are they just useful for stashing stuff?
---
Speak for yourself
---
I deleted the game for the mere fact that they hid features that should have been in the game at the start behind a pay tier. But only you can determine what is worth it. I think paying for SWOTR is worth it but not ESO. Its all a matter of preference. 
---
Maybe far off the future Bethesda will fix their mistakes, maybe not but I will not give them more money.
---
But I don't hate it lol
---
Who knows. The line between bug and feature is permanently blurred in this game.
---
Careful with the shills man
---
Get this guy a fuckin puppers.
---
&gt;  but I can't imagine a server full of players with endless amounts of junk loading in being very stable. 
---
So Bethesda's solution is classicism?
---
Yep, the fake PR bots replied within like 5 seconds of posting
---
or you know the ones that are pissed arent playing, hopefully you enjoy your content, i didnt buy and support this game for it to turn into a fallout eso. I bought this game because i like fallout and they said it wouldnt be subscription and here we are.
---
i am not in your we
---
31+
---
I'm not the type to pay for a subscription so I'm not supporting anything. Just not outraged by them offering it. Take that however you want.
---
1) Time is not a good indicator of quality. Anthem spent 7 years in development and still came out broken with very little content.
---
2) Even if time was a good indicator, saying its been in development for half the time of Fallout 76 is not good sign of confidence considering the state Fallout 76 came out in.
---
$100 a month? What are you on about. Also unless I'm reading everything wrong, they in no way mention having a first membership
---
Mobile camp?
---
My mistake. For that part. But the $100 a month thing ain't true
---
I'm guessing Bethesda "wants everyone to have the same experience" and because people on PS4 and Xbox can't type then they won't add it for PC either.
---
Sorry, you are correct. My mistake. 100/yr for a game we already paid 25-50 dollars for.
---
Only works on the assault rifle if that helps?
---
Google forms are really easy to use man
---
Where did you find it in fort defiance exactly? ;)
---
I think the fact you call people who disagree "fake PR bots" is why I call the people making these posts astroturfers. Most of the people who make these angry posts don't even play the game. It's always the guilty who make character accusations
---
Or $400 in some cases
---
Too true. I feel your pain.
---
This sub isn’t the Red Menace. I personally don’t hate it. Please, next tine change “we” to “us that don’t play any more”
---
Everyone that disagrees with you is a bot. Get a fucking life.
---
Yeah, decided to keep it even after realising how broken it was.
---
I'd rather my tent than the doo doo salesman that seem to pop up by every train station.
---
I craft brotherhood sniper rifles level 1 and hand them out to new players with 308. Ammo.
---
I've spent a silly amount on stuff from the store. Some of it was on sale, but you're right in suggesting things that I REALLY wanted I brought right away, and probably would have done so even at a higher price - the ride on machine, the plushies, the vault-tec pack, the bar pack, floor types... like... a lot. I regret none of it, and at the time it felt good to both get the base-building options and support the devs.
---
(If you go to XboxDVR, search my gamer tag 'tel prydain' and sort by game - you can see some obvious examples of the things I've paid for. Although I hadn't take pictures of my current build with the coin-op cat outside the building yet)
---
But they've lost me as an ongoing source of revenue - and it's due to three things:
---
* The super costly limited time packs with exclusive items, preying on FOMO. You could have sold me a smoke machine... but I'm not paying the cost of the Far Harbor DLC for a cosmetic pack (most of which I won't use), I won't buy single items if they're in a pack (in case I change my mind later I don't want doubles) and I resent the "oNLy sEVEn dAys" pressure.
---
* Selling basic Raider/Free States Gear. I will never pay for something that I think my character could have easily found in the world. To be fair, a lot of things in those packs were fair - but if my character wanted a skull on a stick, that shouldn't be hard to make. If I wanted a free states flag I should be able to pick up a tattered one from one of the many, many free states locations. I will pay for pristine versions of things already free in the game, non-standard fancy skins or items that my character might not reasonably be able to make (trailers, camper vans, etc). I will never pay for anything I can see lying about in the game world.
---
* Non-cosmetics. The other two points limited my spending... the robot and fridge stopped it entirely. I refuse to pay for items that should have been added as quest rewards (like the bag and brewing gear). To add insult to injury, robots/fridges are everywhere and my master mechanic should have had no issue repairing some. If we had gotten a rusty old robot in a text-only quest in the robot factory, I'd have been happy to splash out on some vault-tec or Nukashine paints for it.... but there is no way I'll pay for advantage (even if it's small).
---
What I'm saying is even whales have a breaking point.
---
I have over 700 hours in the game, It was easily in my top 3 games of all time, but bethesda's lack of content and bullshit have ruined it
---
Lol i remember every highschool dance had this song
---
That and a laughing emote are a must have!
---
I played right up until last week. This subscription crap was the last straw. I loved the game. It was so fun. But, God bless. This is going from a dumpster fire to a full blown landfill fire.
---
No that's part of the extra charge.    
---
I mean put it this way, everybody who didn't buy fallout 1st isn't getting their scrap deleted.
---
No. I have 1st, and I’d never want to purposefully place my tent down in a place to block a vendor’s camp. Even if they aren’t selling anything I want, I still like to look at what they’ve built.
---
I'm with the volunteers on ps4 and we go around helping low levels with missions and crafting etc.
---
I'll have to try this.  Especially if I have a fast group.   
---
I've been on one server where there were just two of us, a high level (me) and a low level, and it failed dramatically, ran out of time.  So it's like a SBQ, you need a few high levels to make it work.  My point is that by jumping servers, you also might be helping others complete it as well...
---
Trade posts aren't allowed but I have the grim reaper cutout for the pirate outfit if you have one
---
Ok, thanks. I also have the GR looking for pirate still
---
Killing someone in a pvp zone is griefing, but nuking a camp isn’t? God you carebears are fucking dumb
---
It's seriously one of the worst features.  I personally don't like talking on mic, especially open mics in MMO's.  They're overwhelmingly people who have hot mics that are just activating banging their keyboard, playing music in the background, dogs or birds making all kinds of noise, people eating with the mic on, etc.  
---
I much prefer text chat anywhere it's possible.  I also think it's way annoying that the voice chat is proximity based in the world (which makes sense) but it means it's impossible to communicate with people unless they're nearby.  I'd absolutely love a global and local chat in the game.
---
“For the low, low price of $100/year you can now experience the music of the wasteland on your main menu.”
---
&gt;don't even play the game
---
I wonder when people are going to stop using this tired old argument.
---
The worst is that silly tune that plays every time you open a player vendor
---
It's not old if it's still true
---
My end game is getting all, or vast majority, of the plans.   So far I still have about 5 or 6 serum recipes to go, a bunch of power armour plans, and I still dont have the Plasma grenade plan.  
---
My latest find was the disease cure for the Savage Divide.  A player vendor was selling it.  It never dropped for me...
---
Good job. May your luck continue!
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Whatcha want for the pirate outfit OP?
---
Are you the real Obama?
---
So what if it's true? How is it relevant if people play the game or not?
---
Fuck no. I’m a 1st sub. I got the year. The *only* people that should get the DLC stuff early are people that sign up for public test servers....whenever that starts happening.
---
I didnt do it on purpose. I just put mine where I choose to. If someones camp is usually there I'm sorry. I have a right to be there too is all im saying.
---
So I need to focus on Ash Heap events to get the Plasma Grenade plan.  I've been doing the Breach and Clear events and the Enclave events but I guess I'll have to do all of the workshops there as well.
---
I've been getting hit a lot harder by everything since the patch. I don't have any Sentinel pieces, so I can't compare that, but I am a Bloodied/Unyielding build. Even level 6 mobs are taking chunks out of my health unlike before.
---
I think maybe we got a stealth buff to enemy damage across the board.
---
You must be on console? There's no limit to the number of photos on PC.
---
Where'd you buy the gun?
---
I’m a day one player too, and I get it.  But when I’m seeing players attacking others players just because they want to spend their money on a game, that’s where I no longer have any sympathy for those complaining.
---
Everyone except for the deaf and mute players.
---
Yeah, but I only tried that once and wasn't able to do it. I saw someone on YouTube doing it but I haven't been able to do it.
---
Monroeville mall, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Found it in a gamestop i think, it was the last one they had!
---
Exactly.
---
You're a special kind of stupid, aren't you?
---
you should use some med-x to deal with your pain
---
It's a special thing! What you playing on? Have you took part in the Mischief Event yet?
---
Boo boo beep boo I am a PR bot for Halloween.
---
How much are you offering floop?
---
I have a personal theory that ghouls got a stealth buff, anyone else notice this or am I just as crazy as they all say?
---
Lol idk, I’m a hoarder of rare outfits so unless you have a soiled mr fuzzy suit I’m set.
---
But then that would exclude me because I hate it and still play
---
It'd be very tight for time, maybe a group of a few folk avoiding robots each time could rattle thru it pretty rapid. Quickest I've done it, with randoms, 6 mins.
---
Shows there's an astroturf campaign trying to galvanize the community against Bethesda in a greater message to the gaming industry at large, probably by one specific group of people
---
Really? I guess that makes sense. Probably works the same way mods do in terms of storage.
---
I think Bethesda will just stick their dick in your ear and charge you 11.99 for it. Just play other games.
---
I don’t hate it. But I’m glad they’re back, there is still much to address in the main game.
---
Did the previous games do this?  I can't remember.
---
I think it resets for the new reward, not sure if this resets the progress for the previous day's reward. After all of them are out you should be able to grind them all at the same time. We have until the 12th I think.
---
Xbox, and yes! Someone gave me some Halloween costumes and I went down the last couple minutes of it
---
There was one today!
---
they posted one today...
---
I don't remember either!
---
Because if you don’t play the game, then the only visible purpose of complaining about it is to stir the pot. 
---
I don’t play Halo. I’ve never gone on a Halo board to gripe about it.
---
I used to play CoD. I don’t anymore and haven’t for a few years. But I still don’t go one CoD boards to gripe about the things I didn’t like.
---
you should use your shill check to buy some good taste
---
At least 3 people have posted the link to it... there’s a link two posts below yours....
---
Huh lol
---
It’s like the rare (read: impossible) Fasnacht masks and (my opinion) the beer keg that was introduced way back when Biv was. Maybe intentional for future runs of the same event but most likely incompetence.
---
Ya. Text chat is better than voice. Lesser bandwidth too
---
Will it let me go back in time to play FO:NV? I'd buy that for 1000 atoms.
---
Got the Grim Reaper cutout, Faschnacht plans, Meat Week stuff, new Fireman outfit, Whitesprings caddy jumpsuit, Faschnacht Beret, all of the good seasonal event plans. Got fixer plans, Sheepsquatch plans, Sheepsquatch outfit. Bear Arm plan, Formula P. Got legendary weapons, flux, caps, 5.56
---
I’ve seen it before. But of all the bugs/glitches in this game, this one probably is the least concerning to me.
---
Hey thank you!
---
&gt;Its so disappointing how there isnt really anything insightful or new :/
---
Consistency with the rest of the game experience is important.
---
This!!
---
But, but, that’s what the game SAYS they’re worth!
---
That's just from personal experience.  I'd link a vid if I could... :c

So when you go to character challenges in NW you don’t see it?

No. Stop being petulant little children.

Use the search and look up fallout 76 market. Good luck
---
That IS the trick.
---
I’ve been using mine mainly to scrap junk and store it whenever I’m near weight cap. Sometimes if I’m FTing a lot I’ll use it as a free way pony to get back to the area of the map I’m running so I can hop back to my main camp for repairs/cooking/etc and save some FT caps. 
---
Also useful for areas that don’t have a nearby location for normal FT.
---
Sure, anytime you want to like I said. I don't care if you have friends you wanna bring along either.
---
£100 a year... or £11.99.... either way or would be less than hearing aids, batteries and surgery
---
Agreed, compared to some other bugs this is small fry. Still I wanted to alert people to this glitch and see if anyone else had seen this...
---
....oh and the deafness is just Bethesda-specific. It affects ALL games
---
Next week Will be event stats just you wait... What do you People think they can annouce? The pushed the whole winter update to next year... We Will be empty until march... Maybe an event for Xmas...
---
Heck, of even if there’s still one of those items in the machine if it would default to the current price. Would make reloading my chem vendor a lot easier.
---
How the frick did you get to level 437? 
---
Too much Nuka Cola for you!
---
Seems like it would have been way smoother if the price point was say...4.99 or some decently priced monthly product when you consider it cost more the nextflix, Spotify, Xbox game pass, E.a pass, Nintendo pass thingy, I think even warcraft and pretty much every other monthly service with far more value.
---
This could be summarized as "no news this week"
---
I will fight the fight for all deaf and hearing inpaired people - it can be a very lonely life that many cannot understand
---
When the drop hasn't landed yet, the quest marker is a search circle for the area. Once it has landed, the quest marker turns into a diamond. By the time I got to the place, I had the diamond, so my drop definitely had landed. Although there could theoretically have been a second drop overlaid in the exact same place and orientiation!?
---
Bethesda: hold my beer
---
and there are people who defend this method
---
Its just a thing for youtubers and gaming journalist to shit out in order to keep up the 'fallout bad' hate wagon rolling.
---
Subtitles are flat out wrong in the translations. The English version has tons of typos and errors.
---
Right because complaining about pay to win mechanics and broken promises makes you a child. It's your prerogative if you want to lube up for whatever bethesda does next but people are perfectly within their rights to make a stink about it
---
I've heard that before....well read it here on Reddit. How can they expect people like myself know what's going on.
---
This one?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cabmj6/a_qol_suggestion_an_extra_temporary_minicamp_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Yeah, I’m actually a little annoyed that this suggestion *(and to clarify, I wasn’t the only one that suggested something like this)* is part of F1st. I personally think it should have been part of a quest like the backpack.
---
I’ve actually emailed Bethesda about this and cited my post and urged them to take it out of the membership, or alternatively, make the membership one have some slight advantage over the free one. Like, the free one doesn’t have the scrap box, for example. The rest of it should definitely be free from an in-game quest.
---
Storing stuff, and a quick nap or tune up while waiting for the bomb to drop.
---
Isnt it here until the 5th?
---
It runs until Nov 5th.
---
Your wish is granted.
---
The event goes til Nov.5 so you should have time to enjoy it.
---
Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Well great looks like my problems fixed
---
Well I think it should have been delayed or at bare minimum been released as an early access title.
---
My life is ruined.
---
I hope they do add something for chat. In the meantime, do you have a tablet you can use? The PS app can be used to chat better that way so you don't have to exit out of the game. I use this method all the time. There's also Discord.
---
Lol keep playing mischief night youll get the long one!
---
I've done it 9 times now and 5 of those times there's been assholes who are level 350-500 just melting the boss before my level 65 ass can even get a shot in.
---
Those supply drops aren't, AFAIK, hence why they are locked and marked as belonging to the player who requested the drop (they apparently weren't locked at first, but Bethesda changed that later). Although I agree that they *should* be per player, i.e. everyone who chances upon a USGS drop should be able to freely get their own instanced loot.
---
Also, even more confusingly only the drops you request by holotape are locked and owned by the player. The supply drop from the random encounter (with a bunch of robots guarding it) is public, as is the one from the Morgantown airport event, IIRC.
---
What chemas sell easiest for you?
---
well it is true its more of a...lonely experence compared to falllout 3, 4, part of the fun has always been of exploring locations and such which you can totally do (and its larger world too) so for me thats what i enjoy most sure a story would be nice but to be honest i didnt find fallout 4's story all that earth shattering lol   it still can very much be a single player exploence with a ton to see  draw of games like morrowind,oblivion,skyrim, and fallout 3 and 4 has been a large world you can explore and thats still the case here........it may not be perfect it has issues and lack of a real story or humans who arnt fucking greedy robots that pay you 2 caps for items lol
---
but..........in a way it kinda makes you feel more alone in the wide world just trying to survive lol
---
Self gratification is a whole lot easier than picking fights online.
---
You're welcome. Sorry about that. No harm was intended.
---
Yeah I went to those before
---
Upvoted! Unfortunately you probably lost them at “Dear Bethesda”
---
Did you try turning it off and on again?
---
There are negatives, like having text chat means you need moderators or some other way to handle abusive/toxic/illegal posts, which costs money, BUT that's no excuse for alienating deaf gamers, of which there are many.
---
i wont attack but as long as whales exist companies will prioritizes them first, and people that buy the game and think they are buying the whole thing will continue to be left behind and forgotten.
---
I still think they should have done something with the haunted cabins. Seems like a missed opportunity.
---
Or... We get Take Me Home, Country Roads.
---
Check your internet connection
---
Too busy adding new crap to the atomic store that I'll never buy to update the pictures on the menu screen.

With all the negative lately, I thought that being polite, non-confrontational or unaggressive I could get there attention... that and I am generally this polite all the time.
---
Must be that pay to win mechanic everyone’s talking about
---
Its fine
---
Is it cable?
---
I bet they only have a skeleton crew on this game and diverted their resources to other projects.
---
Make it the Ink Spots!
---
Yup...ended up making a “Nuclear Winter Greatest sHits” playlist.
---
Took me a while to see it but then it bothered me so much I had to instantly close the picture
---
That would be the issue. It was mine. Connect an Ethernet cable and you will have no issues
---
You lucked out.
---
I cant the router is downstairs
---
It's vampires and fairies, not witches. Arithmomania.
---
So is mine. Got a 30 footer lol
---
:0
---
How would you do that? Serious question i couldnt find how to even review this game on bethesdas site when it came out. I would love to complain directly to them.
---
Because people can't be abusive/toxic with voice chat...
---
Put in a support request on their official website
---
Ty
---
Anyway. Hope that helps
---
Aw I wish you were on Xbox or I would help. My advice is to get some troubleshooters gear to help out in the silo. It’s not so bad if you got the gear.
---
I’ve been all over the US and never heard of it.
---
100% agree and would like text options.  
---
I have all the sound for Diablo 3 disabled and its the best game for the hearing impaired I would say. (on the list you mentioned that is)
---
Totally agree buddy! I’m about to sport a tracheostomy tube for a few months and will be speechless. Although I’ve been directed to some mods, it would be much preferable to have in game text chat.
---
I laughed, but the Beth shills didn't
---
Thanks for the advice but would you know the best way to get troubleshooter armour. Thanks again
---
Someone else said this happened to them. Just enjoy it. It’s not F2P.
---
My advice is to turn off the game and forget about it.  
---
I didn't say it was good advice, practical though.
---
It wasn't 20 threads by the same person though was it? Check OP's post history :p
---
Nope saw it before just not anymore
---
Player vendors. Otherwise it’s just random. You don’t need a full set but a couple pieces would help. And if you get a troubleshooters melee weapon that can also come in handy.
---
On PS4. Only froze once at the very end of one of the events, died seconds before the end of the event. Had to close the game. Still got the rewards however when I loaded it up again.
---
I agree the price is a bit much for the small amount of content you get
---
And you’re sure you didn’t complete it?
---
Fixer plan you say? I've got a pirate costume as well!
---
That description is perfect. "Dumps it all over your face" wouldn't expect anything else at this point
---
Its a pretty good guess on why they didn't bother to match this subscription to it: It's not the revolution that people are pinning their hopes on and there would be no point to match a subscription to it because they don't expect it to revitalize the game any particular amount.
---
Thanks, I'll look around to see if I can find some stuff
---
That's not a long term strategy though.
---
There are definitely lots of ways to get fusion cores, power plants are just a simple one.
---
fallout 76 was in development since the start of the development of fallout 76 and it came out bad.
---
OP is discussing their build in terms of Adventure mode. (Although VATS does work against mobs in NW)  
---
to OP: Remember that in NW, you essentially get a chance to choose completely different perks.   
---
Also, XP to a large extent is mostly about Survival time. So the "hide til the end" strategy is completely viable and will net large amounts of XP. How to hide? If you really want to just stay hidden, don't spawn near buildings on the map, then stay near the edges of the fire ring (preferably the "short" end of the fire, as the fire moves faster the farther away from the circle it starts). Stay alive for 5-10 minutes at a time, and you will level up. Rinse repeat, find some folks you want to team up with. Don't be sad about getting shot in the face. Check the map often, move to least likely place. Study where people drop. Learn the ways of the mighty BushWookie tribe!. :)
---
Good luck!
---
Yeah I almost promise if they put that price to a decent price people would have been semi okay with it. People love to belong to something they just don’t want to feel like they are getting screwed just to belong.
---
I just checked and they do spawn as magazines, which have a 20% chance to spawn in general.  
---
There are 104 magazines and 8 of them are holotape games, so that's a **1.5% chance (1:65)** every time you visit a magazine spawn location (if it hasn't been looted already).
---
     8/104= 0.077
---
     0.2 x 0.077 = 0.0154
---
Here's a map of magazine spawn points: https://map76.com/lvli/lpi_loot_magazineslvli00322788
---
Tip: Find the general location on that map, then google it and find a wiki page with "Notable Loot".
---
If you buy them from a player vendor sell them to a robot vendor then buy them back and it should count. Or, at least it did a few months ago when I was collecting them.
---
Unless they're floating camps, then don't spawn them at all.
---
I've never gone to a Halo or CoD board either, because I have zero interest in those games. But Fallout is a series that has been dear to me for 22 years. Probably longer than most here have been alive. I have a genuine interest in how its progressing, its development and future, and I am not liking what I'm currently seeing. Frankly I am worried over what Bethesda is doing to it. So I'm going to be talking about it. It's my right and if I want to express my opinions and feelings about it then I am fully allowed to do so. And when some teenager tells me I can't do that "because I don't play the game" I get mildly irritated. Not only do they think they can tell me what to do, but they also believe that it's a valid argument. That unless someone actively plays the game, they have no knowledge or insight into it. Like I said to someone earlier: Stephen Hawking never actually went to space, yet he was a world leading expert on it.
---
The floor where you have a door with red rays, I think the third, in a room on one bed.
---
Workshops are really inefficient. Running probate servers solo with every workshop to myself; They do not generate resources in a manner that is worth the time. There are a few exceptions like maybe uranium or acid. The set up time and the cost of resources with Perk 2 Construction doesn't make them appealing unless you plan on only holding a bunch and traveling to them continually In a circuit. It's like they are designed to provide enough resources to someone who is only intent on PvP but not enough to supplement scavenging in the actual world. Even the ammo factory with it's now abyssmal rate of production. You can just farm the robots in watoga for lead and steel with a melee weapon in power armor and you'll be able to make more Ammo in an hour or so then you could gather at the ammo workshop. don't waste your time with those places. They are noob traps.
---
Spent my first night out of the vault there back in Beta when night was night and it was terrifying!
---
$4.99 please.
---
Then why would you play?
---
What? Lol
---
Hopefully.
---
They (fallout 1st'ers) are the only people who won't complain, cry, demand a federal investigation into Wastelanders.
---
I can help out just not for a little bit lol the earliest is probably Sunday I can help
---
I do not accept trade requests for this reason only. My inventory is filled with top items and people lose control when they see it
---
I think changing it to the I'm game radio would be nice
---
I can’t believe people are still actually enjoying this trash. I think I have maybe 32 hours or so total on the game since launch? Just can’t justify downloading it again
---
Oh dang, I just got this, yep literally!
---
You have my full support and though I love this game but there’s doesn’t care about us and I doubt they will. Still though I hope they will
---
Thanks but I'll probably have it done by then but I can always do it again
---
As, dude. That sucks! This is an event you want to see. Sorry brother.
---
basically haha
---
Yeah nah just let me know if you still need help by then and I'd be glad to help
---
Ok thanks
---
Oof,xbox
---
Does it? There's only 24 people in a lobby. Maybe if it was an MMO but for a room of that size you'd just need a report/mute system and maybe an optional profanity filter. And it's not a niche feature in of itself either, literally almost every multiplayer PC game of any size has text chat, it's been pretty industry standard for a long time even for indie games. Honestly it's a bit ridiculous it didn't launch with one.
---
I've yet to crash or even have significant lag but on the down side I've yet to see the boss be over a one star.
---
This would rock.  I had something similar same happen today. 
---
My CAMP is right next to the station, so I get a lot of traffic and I have a balcony that looks over it. I put a lawn chair up so I can go redneck: put on a bathrobe and faded visor, then just watch.
---
This guy today kept antagonizing many people, and most of them would emote No, or just ignore him.  he'd get pissed and come try to instigate me every so often too.
---
Popcorn would be the perfect emote.  Popcorn and a beer :)
---
And on PC?
---
I like the wheel better than fallout 4's "tap tap tap" system tbh.
---
Okay I'm curious how much are the suits really worth sold one to a guy for 1k pirate suit
---
I would love a glowing dead body, we had a mod on 4 that make them emit a purple haze once the weapon was put away. I am all for helping the disabled, especially as a deaf person and in a wheel chair... I know deep down they don't care, but I think posts like this help differently-abled people know they aren't alone.

idk it kinda looks identicle lol . Its got even the little baggy in the same spot.
---
Want some cheese with you whine?
---
ONE named community manager did post, but it was in another "WAH MY ELITE 1% STATUS ISNT WORKING. I CANT PLAY LIKE A POOR PERSON PLZ HELP" thread.
---
95% of the time I get 3* drops from her but I always do a lot of damage to her before I swapped my build I would always get 1/2* drops
---
This should be pinned lost 3star marine chest piece
---
At what point are you going to figure out it's time to stop supporting this game?
---
&gt;  Looks like I mistyped the date in the thread title
---
You sure did.  On what planet are there 30 months?
---
These are the kind of vendor shops that send me to Alpha silo.
---
Gonna say 4 raids a year along with 2 big story content updates would be great, I mean heck they somehow pump new zones out with tons of new assets and armors a year xD
---
I don’t actually need them but I use them and the subtitles are pretty off / even bad in some instances. 
---
Squinting at you liberator robot. 
---
&lt;talks in chinese&gt;
---
THIS. at the time I posted, it was 100% true. Once this thread started trending, they shifted gears.
---
One might even speculate that this was the OPs goal all along but I guess I wouldn't know anything about that.
---
duuuuuuude
---
This was hurtful
---
at the time of the post, it was absolutely correct.
---
They seem to actively be avoiding the topic of the subscription.
---
What's the limit?
---
PC players can edit there custom ini file to prevent it from playing
---
I've seen that dialogue about stealing it before, as well as a dialogue to 'search' that yielded some resources.
---
PLANET MURICA, SON!  CHOO CHOOOOOOOOO
---
Exactly the same here. I have a group that are aiming to get raids done and ever since I got fallout 1st they have been so smooth it's crazy. No waiting for terminals to load or doors to open or anything, when we do free range the brahmin react to the "herd" command so much more, when we do project Paradise it's so much smoother, never a problem with habitat a spawns, you can pick up the toxic goo from the  barrels INSTANTLY! That's just a small amount of things, very sorry to go on but it's another game on these servers!
---
Followed instructions.
---
Got distracted by the devilshly handsome man looking back at me.
---
Forgot what I was supposed to be doing there.
---
A very controversial post.
---
Sure, for 700 atoms....😂😂🤔🤔🤔
---
AFTER this post
---
Well conti ue to think...one day...or not...you will realize how much you are.
---
No other game company comes close to BGS.
---
 No other games out there satisfy the itch I have like FO and TES.  I am also very excited for Starfield.
---
 To each their own.
---
Played a few hours last night, didn't see the event come up once.
---
Got some selfies around the entrance to Spookysprings but that's it.
---
I need it
---
Better to just attach a price tag to any suggestion to shame Bethesda for profiteering off our own ideas.
---
It’s rare but could happen. I’ve had radscorpions and other oddballs just flat out change on me mid shot.
---
Judging by this sub's reaction to most things, it's going to piss people off regardless. I'm not excusing Bethesda as they do tend to rush a lot of buggy stuff out the door unless it makes them money (which is a bit annoying but understandable as their initial sales flopped big time) but this community seems to be especially critical.
