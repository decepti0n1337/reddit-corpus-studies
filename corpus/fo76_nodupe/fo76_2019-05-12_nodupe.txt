They want it to not be possible to get every limited time item every week without spending actual money, that would be detrimental to their business. They want you to spend money. Otherwise you just have to be patient and save your atoms for when that special item rolls back around (thats what I do). The broken challenges need to be fixed so we can get those atoms for sure but other than that I don't see a problem with either their practices or with how many atoms we can earn each week/day.
---
You doing ok mate ?
---

---
I’m trying to have a friendly convo with the community of generally chill FO76 players cause I liked the game when I played it before, you’re swearing and getting upset.
---
Preach
---
Remember some level 200+ players have been overencumbered nonstop since level 10. Crazy
---
So a fetch quest? Not that I mind, I think life, film and literature can be broken down to "go from A to B, do X, option go to C, C may or may not equal A" but just piping in before those who truly hate fetch quests chime in.
---
But it is all optional...the only non-cosmetic stuff are the repair kits and the quest posters. Everything else is, by definition, cosmetic.
---
Extra PSA; easy way to do this, go to Camden park. Six skulls spawn at the basketball hoops across from the Dross Toss. Completed this challenge in like ten seconds
---
Wow, I need to find parts one and two. Awesome hahaha
---
&gt; Main entrance not the service entrance
---
Well, the service entrance is directly on the far side of that hill, and the rabbits regularly roam there as well.
---
No, they're the arsehole. You can set whatever price you want.
---
Check the [roadmap](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019), and look at resources like [Mappalachia](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/). Everything is easily googleable, or found via searching this subreddit.
---
You also have a chance to earn badges by completing the Campfire Tales event.  I've run it like 8-9 times and got two possum badges so far.  Also got the smores recipe.
---
This is insanely good writing, especially the blues clues part...+100
---
Yes but still no plans on that
---
So in order to complete the quest I have to seek out people on the Internet to help me? Wonderful.  no thanks.
---
It doesnt change the spawn point to that, that’s a second random event spawn. I did a circuit for the hunters long coat and could consistently trigger an event directly in front of the station AND at the end of that train bridge one after the other, but the station event never triggers when there’s a camp there.
---
No, you're right. It should just stay put like a good creature and just let you kill them.
---
Wow, some people are really entitled...
---
No I'm okay with it flying around and attacking g but when it just flys off and doesn't come back
---
What do you mean?
---
The train track spawn is like: from where you spawn in, just turn around and follow the tracks until you reach the end of the bridge
---
Still available to do this for someone? Last thing before my new badge, thanks!
---
Oops good correction; unfortunately I am too lazy to grind for -60/-60 lol
---
Those aren’t new, they’ve been there since launch.
---
Well, it's hidden in my profile, somewhere between a pile of stank memes and stupid questions. Or I could probably link to them in the OP.
---
Do you really think a week's worth of daily grinding being worth six dollars of atom shop content not a bit iffy? (assuming you even manage to finish every challenge)
---
Damn straight.
---
I did not.
---
Thanks, I keep thinking how similar it sounds whenever I pick them up and it grinds my loose gears.
---
Got tons of random stuff, feel free to come take a look
---
What is it with people expecting every weapon to be viable.
---
I'm not against tweaking for balance but across the board...?
---
Some weapons should be trash. Maybe the unarmed weapons are too OP for what they are relative to the medium one-handed and they should be debuffed.
---
 [https://www.enclavedb.net/](https://www.enclavedb.net/)  has the weeks codes as well, I use it all the time.
---
I get the feeling there might be some PvE content to it. Like the main appeal will be the battle royale/deathmatch mode, but there might be some sort of quest or quests in Adventure mode that like lead up to it.
---
Anyway, it doesn’t bother me. I dont personally like battle royales, but I’d give it a shot; and if it’s not my thing it’s not my thing.
---
Why not just sell them for what they're worth? Most people on the market sub aren't trying to rip anyone off, don't make them seem like they are. Whats the point in selling a rare legendary if you don't get the value it's worth? 
---
And don't assume you're doing someone a favor. Chances are they're just buying it from you and selling it themselves for more.
---
Thanks
---
Now go on back to r/peta please
---
As others have said, there is an alternate way to earn atoms.... Buy them.
---
That's it, they wont add another and I dont understand why they would and nor would I expect them to.
---
Seconded. All the upvotes
---
I actually think when they went to fix grognak’s axe they became aware that over repairing boosted its damage and promptly squashed that across the board. Which sucks.
---
So yeah that’s my tin foil hat theory for the day :(((
---
There are three sentry bots that are always willing to trade me 5 or 6 5.56 rounds for their fusion cores, they even kick in other goodies such as circuits and steel.  The Whitespring should be given credit for their help willing to give it all to meet a visitors needs.
---
I got the refrigerated one and I’m not sure how it compares to other perks, all I know is I have glowing meat steaks from two days ago that still have a 1/4 cnd left.
---
Good thinking
---
LOL.  I still limit myself to 30 stims, 10 radaway and 5 radshield.  If I need more than 30 stims in one go, I'm doing something wrong.
---
I have been able to add a bit more scrap to my stash now that I've cleared out about 150lbs worth of legendary gear.  I was really scraping by with a limit of 100 units of most things, steel being the exception at 300, and no more than 10 bulked lead.  I went extravagant and bumped it up to a surplus of 15!
---
[deleted]
---
I mean I personally would be disappointed but I realize the game isn’t catering to me specifically. Some people will like it, some people won’t. They won’t FORCE anybody to play it and it’s a free update. And if you get bored of 76 for a while because the new content is PvP... what’s the big deal? There’s other games to play until the content you DO want comes out.
---
Beautiful. You are a god amongst men
---
Depending on what you carry a lot of, you're going to get a much better weight savings with Traveling Pharmacy or Thru Hiker.
---
Sorry emotes are almost universally used to BM in online games. For every actual "sorry" used, there will be 100 "sorry" emotes used while someone steals your crops or kills you at a train station while teabagging your body.
---
I have both of those too
---
I always like the route between Sylva and Aaronholt Homestead's  The views are beautiful and it's always nice to drop by Point Pleasant.
---
Thanks a lot.
---
Alright I added you whenever you're ready
---
Had one spawn right around the corner of sunnytop station . He killed me than ran and stood in place on the side of the road . Think that's where he spawned.  Found 2 dead albino radstags too .
---
Love it, play it, enjoy it like a lot of us do!
---
That's awesome, I would do the same if someone asked me,  but I have 2 young kids sleeping most times I play so I dont use Mic.
---
I could understand that sentiment if all someone carried was a fatman or explosive guns. But of course my favorite SMG in Fallout 4 was called the Spray and Pray, so there's that in terms of playstyle...
---
Unfortunately my hoarding problem followed me from FO4 and with no infinite storage it has put me in a very dark place.
---
That's a good price. I only have 2500 caps right now. Mind if I add you and buy it for 5k later on if it's still available?
---
If they're not viable, what's the point in even having them? Who's going to use a pool cue when you can do 3x the damage with a fire Axe? Why use a shish kebab when a bloodied combat knife can out dps it?
---
Everything should be "viable" if you build around it, but at this point some things are just straight garbage compared to other weapons in the same category.
---
I meant optional in the sense that you could choose whether or not you'd want to spend your money on it, the way the system currently works there's a serious strong indication that you should be spending your money on it as grinding is not a consistent functional option
---
Also, a pointing to the ground emote for paper bags.
---
Incendiary and explosive? Would love to get one.
---
The area around Twin Lakes has a lot of flat enough building area. Especially since the updates where grass and small brush/debris gets disabled when you build over it. 
---
From what I can tell, that region is a really popular spot to build camps.
---
I mean, I understand what you say. Charisma is just team perks, but never forget about Lone Wanderer and Suppressor.
---
You can find those around now, at least if you already have a camera.
---
I teamd up for the first time. I sent someone who was next to me a message. Asked if we could team up and revive each other. We did. We killed ourselves and revived eachother. So now I havr teamed up for 10 minutes so far out of 200 hours of play.
---
I'm selling then for 100 caps a pop on Xbox.
---
They have priority issues then! They should know the resources that overencumber them are the easiest to gather... I imagine them carrying hundreds of pounds of steel, wood and cloth.
---
Some people legit don't care what their base looks like. They want a base that's practical and can be deployed anywhere, anytime. This is an rpg/shooter game, not SIMS 2 lol
---
Overencumbered in the middle of nowhere? Deploy ze camp
---
Need to craft some food/meds/ammo/repairs?
---
DEPLOY ZE CAMP
---
That, and melee enemies won't bother you. What bothers me though, are bases that have intricate designs, and the workbenches are SPREAD AROUND. Making it neither practical, nor easy to redeploy.
---
TD spawns in desks and file cabinets I believe in certain areas at least. I think it can spawn like a plan just laying in the open but I'm not certain. I assumed there was an item/object name you could search for simply.
---
I understand about 2 relative objects. It'd be some extra steps to calculate distances between them and then discard any too far away. I've done it with fishing locations and their GPS coordinates before... sort of. I've found all spots withing X distance (miles in that case) of location Y where we're intending to go to out in the Gulf. This would be more computationally intensive but the same general idea. If you'd be willing to provide your raw coordinate data, I'd give it a shot.
---
Lone survivor perk is amazing tho.
---
Now I wish I got that vs high cap. I’d love to know the actual stat. Does it not say when you inspect the backpack?
---
It's very funny when that happens!
---
All I carry are my explosive 10mm SMG (Can't remember it's original name from the quest) and explosive 5.56 handmade but I still try to dispatch any enemies that spawn. 
---
Spray and pray was also my fav weapon from FO4 :)
---
Same way I did it.
---
Into the legendary machines, yes.
---
There are some that do deserve a buff still; M-79, auto grenade launcher, and missile launcher are three off the top of my head that have less than stellar performance for their weapon weights, weight of the ammunition, and the parts needed to regularly make ammunition for them.
---
-Level foundation
---
-Water source
---
-Resource mode
---
-Fuck my shit up, fam
---
Pick one.  That's what your base gets.
---
Same here 😐
---
Aren't you generally supposed to be able to choose if you want to spend your money on microtransactions or not? seems to me that this system is pretty anti consumer if the only alternative to grinding an entire week worth of dailies that you might not even be able to complete for 6 dollars worth of atomic shop content, keep in mind 6 dollars is one pip boy skin
---
I did not have to wait this long earlier today. Repost, try using a title like, Let Me Revive You
---
..."i don't understand why people want content in the game to actually be useful and worth getting" ...Wow.
---
I have a sleeping wife so I sent a message.
---
Should have been there since day one and sad it's still not. What other online game on PC doesn't have text chat I mean really.
---
That's just plain mean.  I've been burning up the Mr. Farmhands at the Ag Center.  At least they try to fight back.
---
PC, sorry.
---
I'm up for buffs, but I get a laugh when I hear people say "don't nerf my weapon that one-shots everything, just buff everything else to be just as OP!"
---
Like I want the Laser Gun and 10mm SMG to be good too guys, but let's be reasonable.
---
For me, its the players not knowing the worth of what they have. From people selling Sentinel Assassin armor for 500, to a player i ran into today selling Perfect storm for 5,000 caps...like...lol
---
daily challenge atoms.
---
Gt: Whataburger..
---
Yes and 3 star glowing ones and legendary gutsys as well, all the time.
---
Some weapons are just better and more effective than others. A pool cue is categorically worse than a super sledge or fire axe as in your example. It never should be equally viable.
---
Also, it makes sense to have tiers of weapons. Like weapons you might use more early game because they're more readily available or cheaper to maintain e.g. machete is a great early game weapons but is less useful late game.
---
That isn't to say that perhaps there couldn't be some balance issues sorted out. For instance, I agree the shishkebab for such an iconic weapon and with added fire effect seems lack lustre compared to other one-handed options, but making all weapons viable just shouldn't be a thing. It's nonsensical. It just doesn't exist in real life and having things setup in a similar fashion in game makes perfect sense.
---
That doesn't mean to say that you can't still CHOOSE to use the pool cue as a weapon. It's just beyond reason to expect similar results to the best weapons in the game.
---
F
---
I have gotten responder bot vender at the other end of the upper tracks with a camp at the pond.
---
[removed]
---
can you tell me a location where you can farm laser pistols and rifles?
---
Thanks, what's your username? I have 20 of them in my stash atm so don't need any more immediately, but I will hit you up when I need to buy some more.
---
Why would you pick the lock to get out? Why not fast travel away/to a nearby destination?
---
Not trolling, but what did they add? I quit playing about a month or so after launch. Is it worth coming back?
---
It's only something I've started noticing recently. Typically it happens maybe once or twice a day, sometimes more.
---
Seems to happen more often to me when I pick up a note that can be read.
---
Oh, and yes, I'm positive there's lead + junk in a spot in the toxic valley north of the butterfly. One of my low level characters has a camp on it with both extractors.
---
It's true visitors spawn in a different spot, but it would take someone dedicated to testing this with some friends: Where do teammates spawn when the vending machines are off vs. on, does the C.A.M.P. device or rather the location of the machine(s) affect the spawn point?
---
I'd rather Bethesda made my guests spawn at the regular camp spawn point. That I end up among the foundations of half the camps I visit can only be a bug.
---
Probably gonna be added to the atom shop soon
---
How prevalent is this? I’ve seen others on here talking about it as well.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/46524/~/why-am-i-getting-a-disconnected-from-server-error-when-logging-into-my
---
Why don't you...read the patch notes? The reddit? Look around? instead of, you know, making _yet another_ "please do my homework for me" post?
---
Yea just had the same thing happen to me
---
Well until some group declares a fair market price for items people will typically sell how they want.
---
I make sales by volume not by unit so the majority of things I sell are well below their in game sale price.
---
I end up selling more units for less and still make a profit as far as expenditures to include materials, caps and time used to get said items.
---
I can't guarantee it to work but try moving the CAMP thing itself somewhere else in the radius. I had it at one place and I kept spawning at the bottom of a cliff as if I fell. After moving it elsewhere it seemed to have my spawn point somewhere else in the radius fortunately!
---
I'm thinking one player took the picture and one player jumped.
---
Probably has to do with griefing or something,
---
Ever upwards, big pioneer scouts related update with backpacks, events and bages, we wait for legendary purveyor in couple of days and new "dungeon" next week
---
You can easily do this hopping back and forth from vault 76 to your camp...4-5 commie bots and you're good to go for another repair.
---
People used to kill him. He's safer behind the counter.
---
That's what I'm saying.. I don't get it 😳
---
This is an rpg/shooter game, not SIMS 2. Some people enjoy having a portable fortress in their pocket, which can be deployed anywhere, and provides fire support. Others like to decorarate their their living room.
---
Just curious, what error are you getting when you try to remove a component?
---
I’m having similar problems trying to edit my C.A.M.P. 
---
A couple of items I try to remove gives me an error something like “removing item would make something inaccessible,” which isn’t the case.
---
Well yeah you are able to choose to spend your money on them.  You either do, or dont.
---
The skins from the atom shop are not a requirement to play the game.  They are a nice to have, an aesthetic so there is no need for them to make it easier.
---
I agree. Some weapons could perhaps do with a buff. Maybe a few with a nerf as well. Balancing or having multiple options is never my problem. Just the expectation that every weapon should be equally usable.
---
By utilizing the vending machines that they released *alongside* *Ever* *Upward* one is still, in fact, playing the game.  Not all of us enjoy all of the challenges, so of course people would want to be able to purchase or trade for items from the questline.  If we’ve earned it, it should be *ours,* not “ours but with restrictions.”
---
Whether or not you should buy things is also optional. There isnt anything on that shop that's going to give you an advantage over anyone else...
---
But thats just.. really boring
---
Do. Your. Own. Fucking. Homework.
---
Do you mean the Perfect Storm? That's not explosive, though, but the only incendiary ballistic gun in the game.
---
Yeah, decorating living rooms sure is.
---
Even if the doors unlocked.
---
I have to be invited in....
---
So frustrating innit? Been at the same spot for ages so the past few days all I've been interested in is building, but because I haven't been able to my playtime now is just handling whatever trades I've got going, feeding legendaries to the machine and doing a vendor run. The game truly is starting to feel like real life lol
---
What’ll you pay for 3k of them? I’m on PC
---
And placing down 8 walls, some workshops, and stairs isn't boring?
---
I guess I personally don't want as much stuff from the shop as you. I think its fair seeing as those sweet PA skins are 1400 and so if you do all the challenges each week at 500 atoms you could get one for free every 3 weeks. I can't do it because I don't have that much time on my hands so I must save what I do get and if I'm tempted enough to buy some atoms for a skin then hey they earned their money because I really enjoy my time in fallout and they're making it better all the time for us. That's just how I feel but if you can get Beth to hear your input then more power to you.
---
Having the same problem
---
would love if they made some functions for the camp system that would let you trigger events
---
- arena
---
-shooting range
---
-settlement defence
---
-auction
---
are some examples i could make up in my head
---
for example give us a siren or an emitter that lets you attract a hore od a specific enemy type once every two hours or so 
---
it then appears as an event where everyone can join and protect your settlement from the horde/s
---
furthermore id love to see fireworks back at our camps like in fo4 where you could create a radstorm
---
I just want the ones that mount on walls.
---
They're so clean!
---
My sweet summer child
---
You mean the one that’s 5000+ at vendor bots? Haha
---
The laser weapons could certainly do with some love. Particularly against certain types of mobs. However a fully kitted smg should be on par with a fully kitted machine gun. Totally agree.
---
Ha, you told me, you're correct now I think about it. 
---
My handmade is explosive though, honest :p
---
I’ve heard of others having issues as well but didn’t know how many were in the only one in my group with this issue
---
Thanks to my new backpack I don't need to use power armor!
---
You're playing a game made to suck your money out of you with zero effort put into creating it. LOL
---
How do they ban if dupers stay below carry weight limit? Truly hope they figured out how to ban them.
---
I had the same issue but got one during a triple SBQ event. Never been so happy to see a low level player joining in!
---
Exact same as you man.
---
Furnishings such as radios are removable but anything structure-wise is met by the 'inaccessible' message. Honestly with all the floaty bases about they should just do away with the messages completely, at least in Adventure Mode (so it doesn’t break Survival).
---
Umm... There are useful items in the game. This is about people seemingly wanting ALL weapons in the game EQUALLY viable.
---
Yea really liking the game atm but its not a main foundation so ill just wait till they patch it
---
Please go be rude elsewhere.
---
Sorry, misread the comment, how about 3k caps?
---
Dude, did you seriously just make the argument for "real life" logic to apply here?
---
It's an RPG. 
---
If you want individual items to represent "progression", then fine, but don't rob us of the ability to make our character how we want. If you're going to make the ACTUAL pool cue garbage, then give us the ability to modify how our super sledge looks to represent a pool cue. I mean, we can stop and edit our characters at any point in time. Why can't we due the same thing with our gear?
---
WoW is a great example of this; there are individual "weapons" that outclass others. But they have the transmogrify system in place to allow players to continue to roleplay how they want. You can still use the badass sword from 5 expansions ago; it's technically NOT the same sword, but your new axe has had its aesthetic changed to look like the sword.
---
That's what I thought, but I just wanted the confirmation from others
---
The value is overinflated. I've seen people sell trash legendaries for over 5k. The market will balance between the lower and higher ends.
---
You should change your character to an old lady and change your face to a scowl.
---
I imagine they'll fix it because its not like its a tiny bug
---
I mean, I legitimately can't wrap my head around your mindset that some weapons "should" just be trash. 
---
Lower level, worse mods, no/worse legendary effects. Sure. 
---
But there's absolutely no reason why a given weapon type shouldn't have SOME viable build to make it useful in the game.
---
&gt; Thanks but I’d rather speak with people,
---
This doesn't bode well for you enjoying the game.  No NPCs, other players mostly ignore you, and you have to search and read what's already there.
---
Same dude Patch 9 was an all time high for this game imo, just trying to remain positive with it despite the constant problems patches seem to introduce.
---
Something about being able to tell which item is the original, and which are the copies, if you duped. If you have a duped item, like just a single duped item, then you're fine cause you didn't do the duping. Proof of this was from the first ban wave and dupe clean up months ago. Everyone had at least one weapon or armor piece that was duped, and still do, so it's not like they can just wipe out entire inventories
---
They have to be at their camp for you to inspect.
---
Somehow everyone who fast-travel to my camp spawn in center of my building (now i NEED to left doors open to allow visitors shop at machine outside of main building), but when I fast travel to my camp, I'm spawned in outskirts, under some rock and need to unclip from texture and run up the hill to return home.
---
Why not opposite?
---
Tuesday in a couple days so I expect we'll get maintenance then.
---
I think i still have a 3 star cultists blade around somewhere gathering dust
---
They'll fix it soon because its a big bug
---
Wouldn't it be nice to have your own Chally?
---
There is no "requirement" to play this game, you can play this game completely naked without ever getting gear, the point is that it's not very optional if the only way to earn it aside from buying it is an unreasonable grind
---
I have opend my door but i am thinking about to look them again ever time i come back my doors are open and mobs cam easely destroy my thinls inside...
---
Fingers crossed for being that soon
---
Uncanny caverns usually has them for me. Outside in the gift shop.
---
+karma
---
Your shitpost is rude, dude. We're not responsible for spoon feeding someone "Is the game good" information several times a day. 
---
Because it's not just YOU making this type of shitpost. Multiple copies of your "I'm to lazy to do my own research" style posts pop up every fucking day.
---
Sometimes I price things at whatever price I would feel good letting go of it for. I don't really care what it's worth because if nobody buys it, I'll just keep it, and if I low-balled myself I'll probably never realize it.  
---
And other things I'm sure are worth more than I've sold them for, but I needed the space and I'm not going to miss them so whatever.
---
Let the person have their dreams!
---
Different people enjoy different things. Some people couldn't care less about building. They'd much rather prefer functionality, practicality and efficiency.
---
I let my girlfriend do the decorating.
---
I couldn’t respawn anywhere tho
---
No way in hell 5 serums are worth 500, expecially when selling a single one at a vendor bot nets you 400-500!
---
Truth.
---
Halo era Bungie were masters at weapon viability.
---
It’s not a shitpost, I’m just trying to discuss the game with others.
---
No one forced you to read it or write an angry rude response.
---
You seem unhappy and troubled.
---
Good on you, but I just dont like seeing floating wooden shacks whenever I play. It ruins the immersion for me
---
Well aside from the obvious disagreement on how much we feel we should be earning from the challenges I feel I agreed on everything else from this comment, wholesome conclusion it is
---
I like how you think...
---
Great! I have 10,000 rounds 5.56 and 8,000 shotties. Gonna start moving these mainly using .308 &amp; 5 mm now.
---
Is this intentional? :'(
---
The highest damage ones I’ve found have been the sheepquatch club and ski blade. I have a 3* ski blade (has plus 1 STR) that hits in the high 190s not using drugs/alcohol/etc and the Club is about the same (and that’s without and legendary effects). The only thing I don’t like about the club is if you only play in first player mode it’s hard to see stuff sometimes.
---
I worked hard on my camp for me to enjoy it, not you.  Look through the windows.
---
People whining about other people's camps on Reddit ruins my immersion.
---
Good for some script. The second two effects would be nice/alright without nocturnal. Sadly nocturnal is just a terrible effect. There's a small window where it's damage is actually high and a long period where it's bad and a big portion where it's normal damage/barely  better.
---
I usually buy 1-2 cheap weapons or armor
---
I mean that's disregarding the part of the community who enjoyed the PvP, and people play fallout because they want to play fallout, nor is rust even an option for console players.
---
What stairs did you use? The ones with an included floor are buggy as hell and destroy builds!
---
Yea, I got it too. My shop is closed for today :(
---
When I visit camps, I like to look around and check it out.  When I like the camp setup or buy something they are selling, I leave a little bag full of drinks and aid in their house to show appreciation.
---
I can’t finish it either, I also can’t do cooking quest  evasive royal jelly is classed as junk not food and the archeologist quest I can’t take photos of the fossil
---
Then.. why go on reddit.. I get the joke but that's just a really unfounded retort
---
Let players rent stalls in Whitesprings.
---
Allow settlements to be built.
---
Bring back old Feed The People event and make other events have server wide impact.
---
Group finder.
---
Text chat.
---
Instanced dungeons.
---
Guild tools.
---
In game mail.
---
Both, still happens without even using stairs at all. To be fair though the atom ones worked fine in my last build.
---
I just bought the plans of the Ultracite power armor (all pieces except left leg plan) for almost 2.5 K Caps.
---
I completely was oblivious about this place and I didn’t know that you could get to that terminal and get the plans for free. Not doing anything, just like how you get the X-01 power armor plans.
---
If you’re still on yes please GT AmandaJ79
---
Just started having this issue today on xbox1 tryed 6 times on my lunch break just to take a screen shot to send to someone.. on the seventh try I got to take screen shot then it wouldn't do anything
---
Hopefully not.
---
Same
---
I use a tall build as well on a different part of the monorail track, as long as that set of stairs or the poles aren't used to reach the upper levels it should work fine!
---
I admit there are methods of seeking out people to suicide themselves for me without a Mic. Just the idea of having to do that turns me off the whole scout thing. Maybe next week I will take another crack at trying to get interested enough.
---
Basically what I realised is Bethesda made more stuff they then proceeded o release before its ready so doesn’t work, sound like most things Bethesda?
---
And tenderizer, travel agent, the one that makes stims happen faster, the lower price one...theres quite a few in charisma for solo players.
---
I hope they say something about it
---
Y’all need to upvote the hell outta this post.
---
Yep it is extremely frustrating to spend all day towards a badge to find you can’t finish it
---
Exactly I only need to do one more
---
By that logic, why are you playing 76?
---
Different people enjoy different things. Let it rest.
---
I hope they can just wiped all the duped items out period. That will clean up the player market so much better and take care of the OP weapon and armor problems. 
---
Without duping there’s no chance for a player to have a full set of sent-ass armor, so even though the armor itself is a bad design, it couldn’t ruin the entire pvp experience of the game.
---
That’s what I mean, 500 each. Which is why turning 5 flux into one item and also selling it for 500 is a good deal.
---
I'm saying you SHOULD be willing to ask for help, just as other people have. Yes, having to go to reddit is a stupid step, you should be able to in game. Bethesda hasn't made a way to talk to people in game unless you're face to face. But, there's tons of ways to see people now, what with being able to to travel to camps. Nothing is stopping you from asking a fellow survivor to help you out in game. You have chosen to come to Reddit to complain about it, but that is entirely your decision. 
---
I find the gameplay pretty engaging, hence why I keep playing. And why I have a few people I like to either play with, or we're at least willing to help each other out when things like this come up.
---
It says cuts it by 60% but it seems longer than that
---
I hope they fix/change it. I have avoided buying legendaries because of it. :/
---
This will come eventually. I’m guessing fall 2019.
---
Bigha1rcut on ps4 add me I need to revive someone and someone in water
---
You can hope they do this all you want, but they would lose the majority of their player base by just wiping all the duped items away. Wiping out all the duped items period would be suicide for Bethesda for this game
---
(Insert childish joke here)
---
I suppose you can still find the individual mod at vendor bots for around 200 caps iirc, but it's still a rare item, kinda like the lemonade plans.
---
Oh shit. I honestly had no idea there were legendary shishkebabs.
---
Mine got stuck.  Had to change my whole plan! Lol
---
Upper floors are way cheaper on budget than foundations and you can just put turrets watching the staircase

It was your intelligence stat effects the condition on crafting it! I think higher intelligence also allows for weapons/armor with longer condition bars as well!

I wished the NO emote wouldn’t thumbs up first. It seems unnecessarily combative.
---
I tried to let it rest, about 4 messages ago with the "Good on you," one. Also, why'd you just ask me why I play fallout 76? What I said and your response correlate just about as well as a fish and lava
---
I’m new, what endgame stuff is there to work towards and how would you suggest I get there. I’m at a loss as to what I should be doing
---
I'm keeping my hopes up that nuclear winter is PvP based, and they make it worth it again
---
I'm glad we could have a tempered discussion like adults. &lt;3
---
I've had some nuka colas go missing from my inventory too!
---
Do the Free Range quest a bunch of times and milk them at the end.  You get so and plans each time too.
---
He he, “insert”.
---
 Go to a train station and read posters.
---
The plans are 5k. I bought those and use them to mod the legs I scavenge.
---
Phrasing
---
&gt;I like how you think...
---
Thanks! After writing that out I'm tempted to do it myself 😂
---
5.56 in fact I am in need right now
---
Thanks! I appreciate it!
---
My first post was not be racist, I'm not. But my friend told me that there were a lot of people there duping guns and selling them. I had all those gins for a while, and all of a sudden they disappeared. I miss my shotgun the most.
---
PC.
---
Good stuff!
---
Omg do it and send me a picture.
---
I was alive in the 70s.  Saw way more of them back in the day.
---
PSN opt_05 - Can we do it in water so it counts for swimmer one too? And then I will also revive you? Thanks!
---
The one in the back. The small building with the armor workbench near the dead sniper. It's on a shelf near lockers.
---
What’s on the posters
---
YES! Keep those other locations coming!
---
Hi, there's no real endgame besides Scorchbeast queen, Real endgame should start with nuclear winter and vaults opening. New update bring us backpacks, first real thing we have to grind. Just play the game and have fun, there is a lot of exploration
---
GG Well done!
---
Sure!
---
I'm not talking about trash legendaries for 5k. Clearly thats overinflated. I mean when someone sells calibrated shocks for 100 caps or an AAE handmade for 1k, I assume they found it themselves so if they want to sell it the effort should be rewarded, or else some other asshole is going to buy it and turn around and sell it for 10k.
---
Maybe you have an idea on an optional way of earning atoms then?
---
[What about my?](https://imgur.com/gQGxDLY)
---
You hear the cash register noise in the loading screen, then you get the popup saying what caps are made when you can see again!
---
Damn I missed that bottom right map. What was that for? I wasn't playing 76 then.
---
Yeah, no.
---
This is what level requirements are for. Every weapon has to be viable otherwise whats the point? Every weapon isnt viable to every player, or every situation. It depends on your build. That is how these types of games work. The fact that the entire class of one handed weapons, especially short weapons like daggers is underpowered is a huge issue. I built my character with one handed melee in mind, my maxed out one handed melee build should be viable against someone doing a two handed melee build maxed out. That is not the case though. Even with gladiator which increases one handed damage. I do more damage with a two handed weapon. And Im talking dps since one handed tends to swing twice as fast.
---
Just what you are doing now.
---
 State what platform you are on and ask for help.
---
You see things from a buyer point of view. But the (few) people that actually have something worth a trade, and they got it in a legit way, are now screwed.
---
Correct, with the Prosnap camera, not with photo mode.
---
Can you go on Survival Mode, kill someone, and then resurrect them?
---
Exactly.   Did this with Microsoft a few years back and they fixed me up pronto.   Best tech support I ever received.
---
do you still need it?
---
The hotfix didn't even fix any issues from what I saw, just made the game more unstable!
---
Not so nice when the shoe is on the other foot? Many of us wanted this experience, but were constantly bothered by base smashers and workshop pvp manipulator teams. We did not like that, but it didnt stop.
---
See the problem I have with dupers who do it and still go and charge caps limit breaking prices for these things. That's pretty frustrating to see. Also duping really hecks with server stability so it affects more than just prices and should really stop so that the programmers can work on new content and not fixing these things every single time. I'm sure its at least a reason we've seen so many features get delayed.
---
Currently the endgame that I’ve found thus far is grinding enough caps to buy all the expensive things at [REDACTED].
---
whoa careful. don't use your entire iq point on 1 idea.
---
I sell things too but thanks for the downvote so I can just waste my time with this post
---
Think I have a friend logging on and we're gonna get it but you're welcome to come along if you need it too
---
😂
---
What downvote? Stop being paranoid.
---
But it was part of the game, so that doesn't really matter. If you think people PvP in any game to give the other person enjoyment you'd be wrong, it's for the rewards.
---
i soloed my first silo at that lvl with a lvl 35 war drum.
---
I ended up soloing my first nuke run at around level 35 or so I can't remember. Burned through about 50 stimpacks. Having expert hacker makes it kind of a breeze!
---
Done.
---
Interesting post. 
---
I understand where you are coming from.
---
But why?
---
I also suck, and can't pick perks worth a shit.
---
Tbh I didn’t either I saw someone selling the Furious SS shishkebab for 750 caps in their vending machine.. never bought something faster even if it sits in my stash
---
it happened on the 1st day of the beta, en-masse
---
yes please
---
I have an explosive auto 10mm smg and it may not be the best but it still takes out scorchbeast and players alike just fine. I hope they leave it as is because its a decent middle ground between really powerful and balanced.
---
PSN longtrainrollin
---
so you're looking for someone to carry you...
---
I’m on PC and would like to buy a bird bone and speed freak. IGN BogeysNBrews. Will send a friend invite.
---
No just keep at it. It's crazy hard. However, the resale value of the crafted items is crap now.
---
Yeah...Im about to be server hopping like crazy to find one now. I am one handed melee and healing build with Friendly Fire. I built my entire character around the shishkebab only to find out once I hit level 45 and could use the one I had that it was kinda trash...
---
You have to go purely by the sound of flies, and if you're lucky, you can actually see flies buzzing around above the meat piles. It's ridiculous.
---
Thanks. Found the check marks. Most don’t have an unequip option. Maybe I’m stuck with them.
---
Forgot about those. I use Travel Agent, Suppressor, and Lone Wanderer.
---
I watched guys do the last dupe and I can assure you that it did not affect the servers in any way. The game just replicated the said object to be duped and it produced it without a single issue with the game. I saw two different dupes and none of them affected the servers in anyways and they did it for hours. Now that’s it’s patched the game is still running the same way.
---
I never get any bonus Ore with the set, so I just use it for thr carry weight boost!
---
Exactly! Thanks for understanding.
---
You can also find hotdogs at Gorge Junkyard. They are on the back porch of the house on a grill.
---
Still carrying my 3* Vampires Ski Sword +40% Power Attack DMG  +1 STR with metal shard mod for Armor Pen.
---
Picked up max lvl at lvl 51.  Lvl 173 now still pull it out and pop a glowing steak to one shot everything in NukeSprings.
---
...I'm a stealth sniper main with perks geared toward that, but this "Snowy StimBlade" cuts through Glowing ones like butter.
---
Thanks brother. I thought it was a botched mission until now.
---
Bad luck i guess. Yeah gonna keep trying.
---
Wtf were they selling for 4k? I could see 1-2k for something like a bloody dragon, but 4k for a 1 star is insane.
---
I like this idea. Surprised it didn’t come with the Nukashine quests. My student/uni life has def featured a lot of pizza with the booze! 
---
Is razorgrain flour even used for anything? The concrete in it is. Offputting.
---
I'll give it a shot.
---
That's nice at least because other methods in the past have seriously screwed up entire servers.
---
send me a screen shot of your camp, and ill tell you what to do
---
Now this is part of the game, and more people like it than before.
---
Havnt tried this. Never really noticed the sound of flies before. Might have to turn my headset up and leave the party chat im in. Hah. I need that sweet sweet loot
---
Cool, thanks for letting me know. I wondered about that.
---
I have my workshop open to the public but the actual house portion is locked off to the public as to avoid people shitting on my bed
---
Quests and content
---
There is a mod for PA chests, creates an aoe of electricity.
---
I keep my apartment door locked so no one can come by and drop a deuce on my bed
---
Ahh I did it to get the smores recipe... Didn't realize it dropped badges as well!
---
Also enemies can't pick locks and they can open doors
---
I sell all my legendaries for 200 caps per star if they don't have a great power. 3 star with junk choices? 600 caps all day.
---
Visitors always spawn where the camp was originally placed. But your personal spawn is always like 20 meters north of wherever your module is currently placed (not originally) for SOME REASON.
---
Due to this I have to put my camp module on the very edge of the camp boundary as far away from my actual building as possible just to get my spawn point somewhat near the front door where visitors spawn. But since the camp area is so small and it throws you so far in front of the camp module I still end up around the side of my building...
---
I don't know why we can't just have your spawn location be the same as visitors spawn locations...
---
How about community goals where we can donate bulk scrap to build a Liberty Prime or a new vendor location.
---
20 meters is 21.87 yards
---
Yeah. Thanks for the instigating hunting rifle level 50 and quad lever action y’all. And I loved that waterfall three story in the mire
---
I avoid the locked doors. Make power doors. The front door is keypad activated but has a pressure plate inside. The back foot is a simple switch. 
---
No lock picking and easy exit for those trapped inside!
---
Electric Bugaloo!
---
Yeah but those aren’t the ones being used anymore and people are complaining about server sustainability when honestly that’s on Bethesda for that. Allowing old methods of duping allowed is on them for Q&amp;A each update since they fix it every other one. The next time they update the servers I bet duper’s will be trying dupes that we’re fixed three patches ago since it seems they rotate on old problems like that with their copy and paste patch work.
---
i don’t see where you’re coming from.
---
aren't explosive energy weapons something that no longer spawns? meaning if you find any for a good price then it's most definitely a dupe
---
Weird flex but ok. If u r active add Haydenj098765432
---
That actually makes it easier to shop for legendaries at least.  You can't inspect legendaries(on PC at least) unless the camp owner is present.  It's pretty dumb.  It'll also sell a different item than the one yo
---
tatos look like tomatoes on the outside but look like potatoes on the inside. the taste is a mix of tomato and potatoes.
---
Well I have never seen them since I did the original quest. Even at night.
---
Yesterday I was looking for "swamp plant' which is supposed to also be the 'strangler bloom' for an atoms reward.
---
They're just not to be found period.
---
A guestbook for camps.
---
what the fuck, I got a 3 star TSE Max level combat shotgun for less than 2k weeks ago, I can't imagine any one star being close to 4k.
---
How do you send someone a message?
---
It's a shame it can't be transferred because I really don't want to do these challenges for each of my characters!
---
It just looks better and fills in some dead space by moving them to counters. The spa was never used, really--nobody goes in there aside from checking the hampers for loot
---
Hmm, I don't remember doing that... but I no longer have the quest, so I probably did.
---
CARAVAN!!!
---
Or poker.  Poker would be chill.
---
I mean fair enough that is on them to allow it to happen but I would put forth that people using methods known to be bad for game stability are also at fault here.
---
I think a fair balance would be to give shotguns an increase chance against adamantium skeleton, this way you may not be high dps but would have increased utility to balance
---
Where’s the 2nd?
---
It's alright, I still find ways. Wasteland will never be safe, just gets harder for the raiders.
---
The torso? Isn't it the head you need for the carry weight bonus?
---
Thats because shotguns got nerfed into the ground
---
Well I could give you a couple of ideas
---
1.Just simply add more challenges to the daily and weekly amount  
---
2.Add like one "hard" challenge in the daily and weekly categories that real nerds could get, which would also offer higher atom  
---
3.Maybe add something similar to cap stashes into the world that you can find but would only give you a very small amount of atom, like 5 or something, balance it out by making them very rare  
---
4.Just make the challenges more reasonable, they're getting very hard as of late
---
Little known fact: Fred started his career as a jazz singer.
---
You need the whole thing for the carry weight. The mining is just the torso
---
Is the bonus negated if you have a weapon equipped?
---
I don't think you will find it a breeze. But good luck - I'm PC.
---
Let's just say it is character building.
---
It should have seen several upgrades in 76.
---
Different grips,  flame alteration,   Electrical wiring, is even altered blades.
---
Imagine it being fully customizable.
---
(2h)Extended grip,   Swing speed grip, blocking grip (guard)
---
Plasma capacitor,  conductive capacitor,   Micro engine, 
---
Maybe a black titanium blade that requires rank five and a major amount of BTS.  Tempered blade, shredder blade.
---
It's in the spreadsheet
---
https://youtu.be/RGuToQ02j4o
---
They aren't a cakewalk, but with some good weapons, good armour, lockpick and hacking perks you should be able to struggle your way through it. If ammo supplies aren't great, I'd suggest carrying knives for the lower level enemies. Try not to get too stressed if you feel overwhelmed. Good luck!
---
I believe pods become blooms during the heart of the swamp event.
---
Not as far as I know but I'll need to test it
---
They emergency fixed another duping glitch but ended up really screwing up the servers
---
Bethesda just needs to implement wind so the doors get blown shut eventually.
---
Whilst ignoring the issues with their camping challenges!
---
I'll help. Give me all you *** legendary weapons! Seriously look in misc tab see if you picked up ore or have a ton of gunpowder. Get rid if missiles, nukes, electromagnetic ammo, harpoons, etc. If you aren't using them. These weigh a ton and easy to accumulate if you aren't watching. Look for armor pieces too some weigh a lot. PA parts are also a weight sink better to put them on a power armor frame then store them for considerable weight savings.
---
And here I thought it was a bug
---
Yeah, I only budgeted 3 charisma to my build for Hard Bargain. Wasteland Whisperer could be fun for solo play if there were more to do with creatures after they're pacified. I'd love to have a pet Deathclaw to name Fluffy. I'd sic him on the super mutants that keep attacking my camp.
---
Thank you. Found one up there on the first try!
---
It is in the dev's 'being looked at' list.
---
I know it sounds pointless but please consider raising a ticket with support.
---
My TSE pump action still does 200+ per shot even without perks. They're no longer god tier, but they're still pretty solid. At this point I just use it to destroy the mainframe and take out silo turrets, but it's worth it for that alone.
---
I think it was a fluke that it was available; they took the game down on Thursday to fix “something”, I’m guessing that got fixed as well.
---
I spent a whole day server hopping till a random guided me to one of the other locations where it spawned!
---
So the same as the two star “good with salt” luck card. I wonder if the backpack and the good with salt stacks?
---
Nice beaver!
---
I have 2 accounts, my first account has 1009 hours, my 2nd account is at 579.. I know I know, but you are wrong.. I don't live in a basement or with mom. I am however disabled and get very little sleep with my pain. at that point I can choose to watch cable tv or do something that is interesting. I find a lot of people are in similar situations.
---
Right it's even worst when they dissappear
---
I would appreciate the doors being left unlocked so I can get out. Getting in is easy - it’s getting out that sucks
---
No they don’t. It says specifically that they don’t when you mod it.
---
I don't mind seeing the odd beaver.
---
how original!
---
That made me laugh pretty hard..... Thanks for the laugh. :)
---
Wendigo Cave has several bone chimes that can give skull pieces.
---
As a unyielding build user I love you guys. I die too much to help with rezzing but always hope someone is. Collecting all 3 makes you the MVP.
---
Or just text chat
---
Read them and find out !
---
Now that my base is safe, I defend my workshops. See you there, but I'll be ready.
---
No just had it recently happen as long as they see it it should be fixed soon
---
You’re crazy for not using lone wanderer
---
You can make a shortcut straight to the game. If the launcher is loaded, running from that auto-logs you in. If not, you have to log in, get past the sash screen, then you’re good to go.
---
See, that's the thing. You're not trying to "start a discussion". You're not providing information, you're not asking for uncommon or hard to find information. 
---
You're making the same post that's been made ..what. Ten times in the last 24 hours by people in a similar boat?
---
I've tried that too and don't find them.
---
You can't make any Rad Shields without them - so is it a bug or not that they don't show?
---
I'd hope so, makes it me fun
---
You have access to the internet, right?
---
I dunno. People are dumb assholes.
---
Funnily enough, I don't want a backpack cause I use PA. I always carry my Excav so why would I need it?
---
Just found some this evening.
---
Heart of the Swamp was not active prior, during or after the bloom.
---
I did not see any players around but there is a possibility that someone might have triggered the bloom via quest.
---
The mechanics of this... blooming elude me to this day.
---
I have been looking for an instigating sniper rifle for a long time. Congrats man.
---
The one I can’t remove is just plain stairs. Odd thing is it let’s me remove the flight that is attached to the floor but not the second flight.
---
So oddly, it lets me remove the stairs that would actually prevent me from reaching something.
---
They are suppose to spawn there in the river, but it's not a guarantee that they'll always be there. I've found them there plenty of times.
---
Highlevel super mutants drop laser rifles about 30-40% of the time
---
I think super mutents got more spongy my mutant Slayer hunting rifle used to take down high level mutents with a single shot now it's take sometimes 5 shots to down them.
---
I’m on the monorail track as well, so maybe that has something to do with it too.
---
Not the response I'm looking for....
---
If it’s a cool base take a photo to remember it. If it isn’t move on before you feel guilty.
---
I did it with whiskey and deathclaw steak which gave me +4 to str putting me at 6 so maybe toy have to get over 5 even though it says equal to or greater than 5
---
dude, someone already compiled all exam answers..
---
3* Bloodied Ss Rw Rolling Pin,  3*Instigating Spear,  3*Instigating Multi Purpose Axe ,  3* Berserkers Ss Rw Grog ,  3* Berserkers Explosive Gatling ,Furious Pipegun , 3* Bloodied Board
---
Just so you’re aware, you can use the Google sheet found in this post
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmbktm/spoilers_tadpole_exam_answers/
---
And get through the exams very quickly. I sat at a terminal and completed every exam there was for Possum and Tadpole in around 10.minutes total, each. Using the spreadsheet makes them a breeze.
---
Now that all of my exams are done and out of the way I can just concentrate on doing the other tasks for the badges.
---
Honestly, I wouldn't mind it if it wasn't so rare. With Encryptid and Scorched Earth being the exceptions, I cannot recall any event I have participated in where I have seen other players get downed and need revival - and these are both player initiated, so there is no guarantee you're going to get to participate in them anyway regularly enough to get your revives. A rare opportunity (reviving a player) which happens primarily in events which are also slightly rare to come across.
---
In practice, this is tailored toward people who always play with their friends who can easily coordinate with another (already willing) person to trade of getting killed by a Radroach or something and revived, so they can get their revives in. Maybe we need a suicide-revive pact emote so we can easily send the message that we want to do Jonestown but with Stimpaks.
---
No
---
+10 atoms
---
There's perks and mutations and Pa mods that make up for low health
---
Berserker has zilch
---
I play a sniper, I only use VATS in close quarters, and generally don't get hit too often. So getting damage reduction and increased AP regen isn't that high of a priority actually.
---
Of course it’s optional. You decide if the things in the atom shop are worth paying for. Or you decide that even if they aren’t worth paying for, you want to support the game and the free content and all the playtime you’ve gotten and so you buy some anyway- voluntary subscription to appreciate the amount of enjoyment you’ve gotten from the game?
---
There is a random encounter with a Ms Nanny that asks you to tag wildlife with a recon scope (The Pearly Peepers do the job too) 'for science'.
---
One of the possible 'targets' is beavers.
---
Thing is, as usual it can get pretty silly. You may get anything between none at all and... all the beavers! to spawn.
---
Make Whitspring a player hub, free fast travel, and maybe figure out a way to rent out hotel rooms. There is not a great way they could do the last one, but i think it could work.
---
Well, I will just go fuck myself then.....SMH!
---
Looks pretty solid to me
---
I wouldn’t spawn for someone who wanted to farm me for XP either.
---
To each his own, I’m a melee build so different POV I guess
---
It's the collage poster from the camera quest
---
you prob knew, campfire event also reward possum badge
---
some challenges are bugged atm..
---
Meh I've actually spent a lot of time hanging out with kids
---
This one kid was obviously a hill kid from the sticks w adhd he was HILARIOUS to play with, haven't seen him around lately
---
Just the really small mantis.
---
I always got him at the one right by the overseers camp
---
Try, dropping 1 to see if it wants you to destroy it.
---
Sorry I just saw this. I will be home in about 45 min. if you still need it. Let me know
---
This one especially, all you would have to do is set up "Bounty Boards" in the most populated areas of the map, and make players be able to post "bounties" for items or even people (with pre-existing bounties).
---
out of all 15 of the replies, you didn’t goof on me, thanks!
---
you found the eyed piper.
---
Do a quest that puts everyone on a team together and you’ll have plenty of options.
---
Lol yeah it's a thing
---
Whatchacallit
---
Random thing
---
psn: cownterpoint
---
Happy cake day 🎂
---
I'll make sure to leave all the doors unlocked 👍
---
It does destroy it if you try to drop them
---
Thank you for noticing
---
&gt;Damn I missed that bottom right map. What was that for? I wasn't playing 76 then.
---
That's a reward for competing the bucket list quest that came with the camera update. You can still get it.
---
Get intestines! Use in mysterious stew or whatever it's called
---
So you wouldn't be able to trade it anyway
---
Until they *do anything* that negatively impacts my game.. it's harmless.
---
There’s only like 1 mod per category. But the way mods get learned is pretty weird. Basically it ends up that the fewer the mods you have left to learn, the harder it is to learn. Armor is the worst, because the chance to learn anything on armor is already “very low”; I’m at the point of crafting/scrapping 30-50 pieces per mod unlock on some of the types.
---
I always notice cake days 🍰
---
I'll reviver you if you revive me? 😂 Psn ascarin1988
---
Just drop anything you want duped next to me :)
---
fuck a couple other people dude.  dont be selfish.
---
people rocking speed demon mutations always beat me to them
---
I have become super jaded towards mutants
---
Tracking Unknowns, Mayor for a Day, Cold Case, and Organic Solutions: these three quests give weapons that I'm still using past level 100
---
Organic Solutions will reward you with a Surpressor's flamer, which is kind of cool normally and very good for support builds. There are definitely better flamers, but I use it as a backup weapon and haven't been bothered to upgrade (it works pretty well when I need it to)
---
Mayor for a day gives you a supersledge with +10 health which is neat, and a 90％ weight reduction. It also has a very heavy mod attached that you can remove - having a very powerful superlight backup melee weapon has kept me alive more than once
---
Cold Case gives you a 10mm smg that lights targets on fire. No other weapon in the game has this, and I tend to use it to mark targets at a distance for other players. This one's very worth holding out until level 50
---
Organic solutions gives you a fatman with 90％ weight reduction. I've picked up better fatman launchers, but again once it's had all of it's mods taken off  having the ability to fire off found mini nukes while only losing 2 pounds of inventory space is very useful in this game
---
There are a couple of other quests that give out named items as well, there's a quest at Morgantown airport for the responders that gives n anti-armour .44 that's pretty nice if you like pistols; but these are some of the better named legendaries you can find
---
We all went through this don’t worry, I spent so much time in my lower levels been broke with no stims or ammo. I started to farm the hospital near Charleston train station for stims and ammo from  the scorched. With the pharma perk in luck you can get quite a lot of meds. Lvl 400+ now, don’t worry, it gets easier haha
---
Added
---
What does it really matter? Player A sells item for 1k caps and Player B turns around and sells it for 10k caps. Player A got what they wanted and Player B gets what they wanted based on luck of finidng an undervalued item and knowing what they can turn around and sell it for higher. The only people who get butthurt are players C through whatever because they didn't find it.
---
I think you've confused me with someone. . . Who builds a damn.
---
be right there.

---
Thankfully this particular segment let me place foundation peices inside it, though they weren't there from thr beginning of the build!
---
You know, I have no idea which game you are referring too, they all seem to fall into the category except, Terraria, Stardew Valley, Salt and Sanctuary and dark souls.
---
Yes. I’ve been doing campfire, but also doing things here and there for the other badge challenges.
---
1. Heart of the swamp available on map
---
2. Active nuke zone on map
---
friend request sent :)
---
Any low hp build has to have Serendipity, that is the first thing I noticed.  Otherwise seems good.
---
ok thanks i will take this into thought!
---
Delete your custom ini file and reinstall. This comes up every time they release a patch.
---
I dont know what your on about ive consistently been at the cap limit since last year
---
..and that's cool! If I came across a legendary gauss rifle at a vendor I'd probably pay whatever I can afford just because it's the gun I really want but I wouldn't get mad if I saw someone post something the next day about finding one for  a fraction of I paid for. It's not like it's hard to make more caps.
---
Your .ini files might be messed up. You have to add mod archives to the archive list in one of the .ini files, but the list also changes when the game updates and adds its own new archives to the list.
---
 I have been harvesting them for a while. They spawn from few days to a week after you pick em. I know where they are and go by once in a while.
---
No, i think maybe decrease it by 50 at most. But that seems fair to me.
---
Yea, it asks me if I want to destroy it.  Hmm..  
---
Tried to repair it - that worked.  Now, I want to see if I can direct trade it with anyone (either repaired or not).  Seems really weird to scatter them all over the place randomly without the ability to turn them over to others that don't have one.
---
Ha 😂
---
Hell yeah, Canadians time to shine even were are killed in fallout timeline
---
Do "Tea Time" at the Giant Teapot and in the 3rd wave of attacks, one or two wolfs will attack.
---
They were in "floor decor" but I'm guessing they got removed after the hot fix yesterday.
---
They have the model, they just need to have an intern integrate it to the build
---
Excellent observation! So he’s not raging at all, he’s just belting out a little ‘Fly me to the moon’?
---
I’d like to see that. I came up on one camp that was on a raised road in the divide. When you come up to it, it just looks like 2 or 3 vendor booths. But when you look over the booths, it was a compound just out of sight. Freaking awesome use of topography. 
---
Congrats on the rifle also!
---
Do people only want this because they can wake up in a wagon?
---
Are you wanting straight up chuck Norris bare knuckles or pwr fists kinda unarmed? 
---
Also I would swap your adrenaline for 1pt escape artist, 2pts ninja 1pt Gunfu and 1pt sneak. You will be snapping from target to target and the sneak let's you dominate things, even if you get seen you will have the resistance to be fine but you'll be one tapping everything. Also you could swap those back for adrenaline if your not a sneaky play style. But I'd suggest gunfu when fighting mobs to it auto snaps to next target.
---
As I said I had it off. Others mentioned high intelligence effects it.
---
I'll have to give that route a shot, thanks for sharing your findings.
---
My favorite spawn is inside my mountain, it’s insane because the entire mountain has an inner layer that you can climb around in, sadly I didn’t get much of it in my camp space but it’s fun nonetheless.
---
A solution to my problem specifically is if the suitcase next to this bed in the Mire traincar bunker was gone. It's mainly my budget that I'm annoyed with
---
Drop the 3 point iron fist and get 1 point each in the 3 different ranks. You'll get +30% damage instead of +20% for the same price.
---
I found that as long as your feet are touching water you can get the badge achievement, which make deathclaw islander be the best place as your u can strip of naked, aggro the deathclaw, return to the shore and die, then provided your buddy with far enough back the deathclaw will reset allowing you to revive and change places. Oh and the one revive can work for both advancements.
---
lol chuck norris, no im going to be using unarmed weapons
---
thank you I will aim for that perk card
---
Awesome then I'd suggest you use the sneak switch because you'll need that extra dmg
---
Dose anyone see an issue with 2 people becomeing friends, with the intentions of killing each other?.
---
Out of curiosity, what's your level
---
The backpack got me off of my hoarding habit. At level 198, I was able to sprint for the first time since level 15. I need a backpack, full set of deep pocketed armor, 4x weight reduction legendary armor, and all the weight reduction perks I have equipped at once...but I can finally fast travel!
---
You misread his message. He said “pack”. When trading directly, other players see your whole inventory. Unless that changed last patch.
---
Get. Friends.
---
Just fast travelled to a vendor camp and spawned into a locked house. Picked the lock to get out and became wanted in adventure mode. Ugh.
---
461 on my main
---
The best part was you didnt even need power armor, just a high enough strength special. It was really satisfying to tapdance on the egg caches
---
So they added end game content, nice
---
Grafton  station
---
Nah, people were offering to spend atoms on stash space since December. The amount of people complaining about it would be a tiny percentage compared to those who would be excited for it
---
cant really elaborate, much. get the notification when it breaks, use armor station to repair. sorry friend, that's all I have for you.
---
I can but I won't be on for at least another hour.
---
Possibly, I found someone to try this with but we cannot get the water one. Pointers?
---
How did the last one work? I didn't hear about it until after it was fixed, but I have a few guesses lol
---
Thank you
---
The ability to place requests on cork boards a train stations or the new terminals. Ex: I need ten bloatfly glands, will pay 10 caps apiece; or: I need a light machine gun, will give you 3 atom packs in return.
---
More like let me out! I can’t count the number of times I’ve fast traveled to someone base only to spawn inside the locked house or worse in a foundation.
---
Use that and the disease mutation and rad roaches and mirelurk hatchlings are no longer remembered
---
You're the mad crapper aren't you?  Leaving bags of fertilizer and toilet paper on the beds, right?
---
Not actual end game, but a lot of things to grind. Real end game should start on summer
---
He and Wallace have been very outspoken about the 10% tax.  I think it was a message.
---
It’s in the conference room in the southwest corner of the room.
---
Religion into the game.
---
They needs to be cleansed with my explosive gatling plasma.
---
That would be more interesting than joining the scouts.
---
Saving this for later.
---
Yeah good try. You don’t need to know how it worked. Just know that it did and some people really, and I mean really took advantage p of it for the greater good of the players who want good stuff. That’s why there’s BE lasers now, AAE Handmades for 5k and AaE shotguns for 3k. Once they totally fix it you’ll then start to see the good stuff. AAE/FE/EE/TSE plasma gatlings/ laser gatlings, quad explosive (aka makes its own ammo) harpoon gun and TSE laser rifles ,
---
In regards to junk mapping, i think springs should be included if possible
---
Thanks for this - sometimes I was so low on fusion cores I had to take the 25% ones from the various Power armors around the place.
---
What do you mean good try? I am asking AFTER it was fixed because I am curious. What, do you think I have a time machine?
---
In a word, no. The ones who are off base are the people who list twenty non-legendary weapons so people will stop at their camp.
---
Well if you go to a workbench and scrap all, then the pieces are scrapped.  If you die, then you have to go get your paper bag.  The insect pieces count as junk.
---
Glad I allready placed 2 deathclaws down at my camp lol. Should have placed a couple cats down too.
---
Agreed!  My electrified asaultatron blade is useless compared to my spiked ski sword.  That makes no sense.  And i want to use the asaltaron blade cause it is awesome looking, but i don’t cause it is useless.
---
Better fix my garage door the next time I'm online now.
---
The collector challenges only count if acquired in the world, not from other players. Sadly.
---
Cause it’s called RNG
---
Ah, that bethesda quality.
---
No. I did not work hard on my camp and it is MY camp. But feel free to stay in the guest room that is not locked.
---
I understand. Best of luck in your endeavors. Hope you get through them easy enough.
---
I was just trying to be helpful and Im getting downvoted? C'mon people. You're being ridiculous. Maybe it's best you're playing alone if this is your reaction.
---
That would be much better than the pvp mess we have now.
---
Bethesda will break it again and it’ll work again that’s why. We don’t need you making guns/ armor when we’re making it. Plus I’ll give you a hint, you’ll need caps, lots of caps. We went through 2mil caps making good stuff.
---
Yeah it stopped working for me to.  On the day it was first available, I got up to 5/10, but it quit working.
---
Archer is pretty easy if you kill low level creatures. There are both squirrels and rabbits on the hill by the servants entrance at whitesprings..I was able to get a pic of both in one shot.
---
I’ve heard the Razorgrain Flour is used for S’mores
---
I grew out of this when I got toward end game but a single foundation blueprint is very easy to place.
---
Im on XB1 so it is built in to the UI. Click on their Icon on the map to send anyone a message.
---
Are you sure?  I have no idea how anyone would list that much junk for sale because it puts it in your stash when you list it. Speaking as a person that has a junk mule and probably close to 500 of each type of junk, if I tried to put even a quarter of it in my stash it would instantly be full, no way someone could legit list 1,000's so even getting it to list would have to be a glitch as well.
---
Nothing stacks beyond 90% reduction. If you have perks, weight reduction armor is pointless.
---
Best (for a mule/trader) is weapon weight reduction since it’s like 12 perk points to cover all the weapons, and that still wouldn’t include rifles. WWR would get everything in the Weapons tab.. then you just need junk rat, thru hiker, bandolier, ordinance express, traveling pharmacy, batteries included, and maybe armor/PA weight reduction and you can carry everything in the game at 75-90% reduction.
---
It does!
---
LOL did they break the Enclave again?
---
It took me about a dozen Campfire Tales to get the recipe, sooooo happy I finally got it.
---
I get mine from sentry bots at the white spring. If you loot them quick you can get one before and after they explode. They are always above 70%
---
And it keeps the challenge complete when  everything wears off. That was my irrational fear that it would disappear when I was back below 5
---
Thank you for this, I’m always running out.
---
So what's the meta now for weapons? Or at least what weapons should be good to go after now?
---
For the cooking challenge, every recipe except S'mores is sold by the Protectron chef at Le Grand Gourmet, inside the Whitespring. The S'mores recipe is a rare reward for completing the Campfire Tales event at Camp Adams. 
---
The only ingredient that's nigh impossible to find is Royal Jelly, because it's bugged and only two static spawns of the useful version can be found in the world. One is in a basket by a grave at the Middle Mountain Cabins, another is in a bathtub with some moonshine supplies at the very top of Tanagra Town. They're on a long timer before they respawn, but they don't spoil. (there's a junk version of Royal Jelly dropped rarely by Honey Beasts, but unless you want some challenge in your hunt for antiseptic it's worthless)
---
If you're playing for atoms you're playing it wrong.
---
Yes, is it fair lol?
---
I did archer, swimmer, hunter, 2-E-Z.
---
Except for killing a yoa gui with a syringer. . .
---
We should be able to cook a bowl of Noodles 🍜 ( RAMEN ) all flavors ! Hahaha
---
I think it happens when you go in a zone where someone else killed them before but f076 re-instantiate them but figure out they are already dead.
---
First deployment concept is bad.  Means you spawn directly in center of workable area.  Which means it's probably covered by building.
---
I set up a switch on mine, so it can be open and closed using the switch from the outside
---
I recommend low level scorched near vault 76 for archer. There is an 80 atom challenge for 50 scorched kills with crossbow, so 2 birds, 1 stone.
---
Orrrr maybe it's because you are the bringer of DEATH!!!!! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Huh, I must’ve overlooked that. Where can I find the switch? Is it a plan, or can you build it right off the bat?
---
Honestly, not that sure, I just know it's in the power connectors area of the camp menu.
---
Great, thanks.
---
Servants or service?
---
It haopens to me on occasion. One that made me almost brown my pants was when a scorchbeast dropped out of the sky right in front of me.
---
Broken or repaired, once it's in your inventory, you can't trade them sadly
---
Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.

Think of it as (unintentionally) doing a kindness to the buyer.
---
It's because they all like to... "RUN AWAYYYY!!!" ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Wolves can be found in the Free Range event, Leader of the Pack event up near Tyler County Fairgrounds, and there's sometimes a spawn point east of whitesprings near the mine.
---
Squirrels can be found near helvetia, but there is a guaranteed spawn point on the east side of the whitesprings main building.
---
Rabbits were tougher. Look for places where small game spawn. The first farm you come to upon leaving the vault (out in the field), there's a spawn point on the left when you're coming to the covered bridge leading to the overseer's camp, and in the woods heading towards Flatwoods (to the right of the Welcome to Flatwoods sign where the dogs are).
---
Yes !  Formal attire only in the ballroom or the security aggros you !
---
Hate to say it, but that pit is worse than the Bermuda Triangle and the spot between your car seat and the center console put together...
---
I sure love concrete in my s’mores
---
Are we?   I have traded dearly for my collection.  It is now falling in value.  But I enjoy it just as much.  But I am a collector, not a trader, so my priorities are different than those who enjoy the trading itself.
---
Squirrels and beavers in between vault 76 and the lighthouse, 
---
  Toad in the river in Helvetia,  
---
wolf in the even leader of the pack at the amusement park west of vault 76. 
---
Yao gui in battlefield cimetary
---
Mirelurk hunter in the campground next to lewisburg station
---
Mothman- i heard it comes after you if you steal eggs from underneath its statue. But never tryed it.
---
Is there links to some other way to view these? I can’t seem to make out a lot of things on mobile. It’s just a little small and I would love to utilize these!
---
And now.... I am sad.
---
I found him in the lake near charleston
---
If you’ve not done it I can help
---
I'll be here please reach out!  I farmed enough grind early months in the game just enjoying it now.  Not particularly up for crafting and scrapping 40+.
---
Mini games for our camps.  Darts, billiards, maybe two player terminal games.  Horseshoes, it could work like Dross Toss.  Definitely darts though for sure.  Darts please.
---
You didn't see anything... *waves hands in a mysterious circular pattern*
---
Someone has a low charisma build.
---
You looking for a tse gauss or just a legendary gauss. Also what platform I may have a few legendary gauss rifles but not sure on what they are lol
---
There is a genuine lack of agreement as to pricing.  Some are selling way above the suggested price and sone are far below.  For some items I’d have no idea what to charge eg plasma cores on ps4.  I have 30 right now and no real need for them.  what’s fair the 162c suggested price, the 16c I’d get from a vendor or something greater?
---
"The game takes place and West Virginia if you have a soorrey emote it will ruin the immersion!"
---
Proceeds to build physics defying house and run around the game world in nothing but a dress that somehow protects against bullets
---
Gotta remove all or none buddy
---
You can buy a serum for 200 caps
---
I hate the way it it works now. I always forget what I need to do for the opossum challenges so I have to open the painfully slow list all the time and on top of that I can barely read the text on my tv.
---
You cannot choose what mutation is removed by radaway, or gained from rads. If you use a Serum, you get the exact ones you want. Serums are cheaply sold by nice players.
---
I believe you start on the west end and, if you're facing towards the east end, the start will be in your left. Don't quote me though...
---
Yours is out there. Trust in Atom
---
This is not true , every radaway u use will remove one random mutation but you can't control which one that will be
---
This has never occurred to me and it’s such a great idea.
---
Yeah I tried to find bird bones but they are all around 1k and I keep bleeding the vendor system dry
---
Ok regardless your better off buying a serum
---
Thanks!  I just had it stuffed!
---
In the beginning, I was selling my excavator calibrated shocks for 500 caps per leg. The demand was so high I rose it to 800 per leg. Today, they're 1200 per leg.
---
You're giving them a sweet deal in my opinion
---
No your base hadn't loaded in for them is all
---
You never stop getting perk packs, and they'll always drop one animated perk card. No other way to get animated cards at the moment.
---
I still get them after level 50. You get one every 5 levels in the card pack. The gold one you see is the animated one.
---
Well at least you were brave enough to use a year old account and not make a new one props for that
---
Yeah, like the other poster said. The animated cards are simply the gold cards at the end of each pack you recieve
---
Who what when where why and this is the best request I've read in ages ! If I knew how to give gold I would
---
Agreed. I’ve found myself putting many free things in mine
---
* Copy your current installation somewhere 
---
* Start the download in the Bethesda launcher. This may just pick up the location and fix without downloading and you’re done. If it starts downloading something, exit the launcher. 
---
* Delete the stuff that your launcher has installed and copy your backup copy over to the same location the launcher was trying to install it to. Make note of spaces in the title. When I moved my install from hdd to ssd, the folder it chose was named differently.
---
changed mine from brother to ass 🤣
---
So is there no intercom you press, you just do it?
---
Ive already addressed that. The first clip was 1 minute long. He had 40 seconds to load my base in, then you can watch him at the 42 second mark walk through the purifiers and cement foundation. 
---
Followed by a minute later, his friend sprinting in through the cement and still walking through it 10 seconds later.
---
There's no way to scrap the duplicates we get? Also do you still only get a perk pack every 10 levels, even after level 50?
---
Oh please tell me where I can buy a 3 star handmade that isn’t a crap spec for 5k.. I’m on pc.
---
The production terminal shows the plans for x-01 ultracite optimized bracers 🤔
---
Theses are not the droids I'm looking for.
---
Sounds risky.  And when you say “copy” to a USB— that doesn’t add up to me since the FO76 exe is somewhere near 80gb at this point.  Did you mean something different ? 
---
Otherwise I guess I could use an External HDD with more space but I’m trying to avoid stuff like that at the moment .  
---
 No way to scrap, and it’s 5 levels, not 10.
---
For those who have locked camps I will break in any means necessary and I will drop as many bags of poop inside your camp as possible.
---
I can only imagine how much time I've spent doing the same... Marsupial is a hell of a drug(mutation)
---
I think it is fine the way it is. The Travel Agent perk helps, and the game needs more places to spend caps anyway.
---
Also, it may not be that difficult to calculate this, but the map is slow enough to come up already, we don’t need to anything else slowing it down.
---
The image fits pretty well too, those bucket heads are kinda like cockaroaches :^)
---
No joke I got on 76 last night for the first time in a long time and said to myself “getting low on cores. Should probably check reddit see if any hero’s made a map of spawn points yet” so god bless you stranger
---
Dude I went to a camp and this guy built so far up. I was amazed.
---
If they could no clip why didnt they just walk out your camp lol
---
If they don't like the price, shop elsewhere. Why do people not understand that simple concept?
---
Yea it takes longer then that sometimes to load in especially if they had bad internet
---
Advanced Power Connectors plan.
---
It gives all the cool keypads, pressure plates, switches, etc. It's pretty cheap iirc, I think I got mine from Harpers Ferry.
---
Just use a bit of logic with the connectors and you're good to go.
---
They did.
---
Isn't that the first one?
---
This may be dumb to ask out loud, but how does one acquire backpack mods? I have unlocked the beginning backpack but am unsure how to acquire the currency needed to purchase mods from the vending machines.
---
I found the farm just east of dent and sons, but thank you, there was a farm and 5 of the two headed white deer waiting for me.
---
Right when you spawn in, there is a train engine, jump up on top and look around the string going to the whistle
---
I already did this, I wanted to give to friends who didn't have. If you can't drop it, it means you can't trade it
---
It's every five levels, not ten. No way to scrap extra perk cards whatsoever, although if you have a version of a perk card at every rank (example: you own Action Boy rank 1, rank 2, and rank 3) you won't be able to pick that card again and any copy you get from a pack is deleted.
---
I must have gotten a shiny version of Starched Genes like three times now, but since I got the rank 2 version on my own and pulled a rank 1 version from a pack, I never keep it. :T
---
Okay thanks
---
Read the entries in the terminal inside the Hunters Shack to start the quest.
---
Yes.
---
Source: I've done it like, at least five times
---
There is an intercom. It'll be the top of the bridge, not the bottom.
---
The Encryptid event is excellent for this.
---
Hey which ones more logical, physics not existing in the fallout universe or Canada’s existence as a whole
---
You still have that one you need to do in the water for the swimmer's badge?  I will join you if you want - I need to knock this out, too.  Let me know and I can add you
---
Pool at Whitesprings...?
---
I'm sorry, what bridge? I've been looking everywhere and I can not find it.
---
With just 1 star it's probably not worth much. I'd throw it in a vending machine for like 300 caps, and if it doesn't sell in a couple days just feed it to the legendary wood chipper.
---
Yeah, probably easier than a gun build. Your only issue would be the laser turrets, but you can just hop up and smack them. Since melee is so hilariously overpowered at the moment you won't have any trouble with the grounded enemies
---
Nah i have my own garden
---
Fatmans dont have much value in general, they break super quickly and the ammo is heavy, for a bloodied build theyd already have high damage with another weapon. Still you can prob sell it for 500-1k caps
---
I carry a shotgun to deal with some of the ceiling turrets, but other than that I run silos as a melee build all the time.
---
Yeah I buy ones I should not of lmao
---
I think it's a bug?? It seems so silly...
---
Ha service 🤣🤣
---
I can make one for free if you provide 2 flux
---
It isn’t the ropes course. It’s the bridge further south. Made the same mistake. One you get there you’ll see it. Start on the east end.
---
Yes, get trouble shooter gauntlet. The end.
---
Keep looking. You should be able to find it for 500 or less.
---
Awesome! I'm going to focus on restocking the Stimpaks I used up and will attempt it once more. I nuked fissure site prime and no one showed up sadly. 
---
I heard nuking The Whitespring is quite popular.
---
New River Gorge Bridge - West. There's a top section and a bottom section.
---
Please use the search feature at the top of the subreddit home screen. This post happens about 8 times a day
---
It would be nice if the power armor station actually let us store a chassis that shows all pieces of the armor equipped to it. Then we could show off our paints and also leave the 10 pound chassis in our camp to save some carry weight.

Took me a second but bravo. 😂
---
I have the Bloodied Grognak Axe that does about 200dmg and all my other melees are above 100dmg so I will definitely give it another go this way. Just got to restock on Stimpaks.

If you don't mind what places have you nuked?

I'm torn between Whitespring and Flatwoods for some reason.
---
I just enjoy seeing everyone’s bases &amp; having them able to see mine! It really gives the wasteland that together feeling!
---
Oh, awesome man, thanks.
---
I mean, I understand the concept, but the dude's message confused me. At first I thought he was pissed because they were too expensive, but as someone else pointed out he may have been angry that I was undercutting him.
---
Oh well, fuck him. Someone else will get them and be happy.
---
Yeah, weird, I've yet to find the Sheepsquatch costume - not the mascot one, but the other one that kind of looks like the Cultist Robes.  I have tons of mascot outfits and those damn fedoras, but that one has yet to drop for some reason.

Yes. Done it a bunch of times lol

Better events that require more teamwork. Everyone and their sister's cousin attends The Imposter and SBQ but every other event usually pulls in like 3 people
---
I spawned on top of one of the small whitesprings outbuildings the other day, the player had built walls and a roof around the top of the building so I couldn’t damage it. There was a mirelurk outside so I couldn’t fast travel. I eventually just switched servers.
---
Oh my god thank you so much. Will you marry me?
---
That's it!  Thank you.
---
Get off of Reddit Dad!
---
Yes, it's absolutely possible.  Especially if you luck into a silo where the turrets are missing, which seems pretty common.  Otherwise, you might want to bring something to deal with them.
---
I've nuked Whitespring numerous times, fissure prime (if you nuke fissure Prime to do a queen fight, make sure forward station delta is outside the radiation zone!), Harper's Ferry twice. Morgantown is good for flux, as is nuking the area around general steakhouse. But if you want XP and legendaries, go with Whitespring, Harper's Ferry (for the underground area) or fissure Prime to do the queen and all her minions
---
No that's what I meant, you'd need something big enough to copy it to. I have a 128gb and 256gb thumb drive that could work, they make them bigger, but if you have an external hdd then that works too.
---
There's no risk involved since you can just re-download it if all else fails, unless data caps or terrible internet are a problem.
---
Also! If you have it, max out and equip the robot hacking perk. Gets you through SO fast
---
Quick question, how does your Bloodied Axe only do ~200 damage? Are you a Bloodied build? I’m used to seeing the 500+ damage by most with a Bloodied weapon.

I didn’t think 5* were even a thing yet?

Good to know that it is common to do it this way. I am just now really investing my character in melee so I wasn't knowledgeable on how effective it really was.

From other posts I have seen, some players HAVE a difficult time with the concept of shopping elsewhere. They want it for free and want to sell for kagillions.

Truly an Appalachian cuisine
---
Yeah. Fortunately it seems I managed to keep mine from the beta. So I've been able to use it. Don't know why they won't reintroduce it. It's not like there aren't more problematic issues to tackle.
---
Don't believe so. Speed demon doesn't stack with the pistol runner perk (increased speed while having a pistol equipped) or with the perk that increases speed while health is low
---
My new camp doesn't have an upper floor and is designed so that the vendor area is walled off but still inside my main room with a jail cell door so you can *see* into my camp but not go in without picking it.
---
I just did that for design purposes, since in fallout 4 and skyrim vendors dont like it when you go into the back and start looking into their actual home. I still leave the door open so you can go in, but it's good to have the choice to keep the public area closed off from the private area.
---
Also the vendor station reminds me of borderlands for some reason so I designed my vendor area like some sort of borderlands quest hub with a notice board with the 3 quest giving posters
---
It’s dumb but I wish I didn’t miss the frat poster to complete my set.
---
Don’t new weapons spawn regularly, or are most weapons circulated through players?
---
I've been going and getting teddy bears and selling them for free because of the collector challenge
---
the worst part is when you spawn inside a locked door and can't leave. I usually leave raw fertilizer in a very obvious spot for them to find.

Oh yes thanks for reminding me about that! I need more items and perks that deal with robots more easily.

The three star weapons that are really good are somewhat rare. 
---
For example, he bought a three star hammer that has +30% against ghouls, +40% swing speed and +1 strength off me.  It’s doing 600 damage a swing with the right perks in a nuke zone without adrenal reaction. 
---
Not a common drop and he paid the 1000 caps like it was nothing.
---
Sunday, Sunday, SUNDAY! Everything must go, am I crazy? Look at this straight jacket I’m wearing, only 8 caps! How can I do it? By killing Super mutants by the burned out truckload... woooo!
---
That’s true they should throw in a casual no/sorry head shake
---
Add me I can do it in a bit tonight
---
Medic and Herpetologist are the only ones I don't think can be completed at all currently (due to the Froc Habitat not counting and Stimpak Diffuser not having been added to the game yet).  I have completed Athlete, Archer, Hunter, and Swimmer so far myself.  Currently only need to milk 9 more brahmin, get a Mothman Wing, and take a picture of a Honey Beast to complete Mammalogist and Entomologist.  Cooking I am waiting until I feel like collecting the Royal Jelly and have the S'mores recipe before I bother with it.
---
No but once right after the patch once I built my vendor machine I got "server not responding" a lot
---
I have 3 out of 4 no idea how i did it
---
OP means Grahm for sure
---
It’s like he knew it was a god level weapon and snatched it up. He’d shit if he saw what replaced it.
---
Yes. Look out for golden face
---
I’m pretty sure now they are referring to a player
---
That is a great question
---
Just grind caps and buy one on here for like $7k.
---
dob't forget to spice it with nuclear materials
---
We really do need one.  I've shot more then one person who appeared out of nowhere while I'm sweeping and clearing an area.  If you don't want to get shot announce yourself please.
---
No, it’s a player
---
Beyond me... I will be curious to read other’s input.

900 caps. No, not guaranteed. If you track him down you need a friend, so each of you can keep relighting off of each other to keep rerolling his inventory till you get what you want
---
S part of map - If you encounter a skeleton in a wheelchair on a second floor in front of a terminal - continue on. It’s a bit worse then this.

Yeah I can carry more out of PA just by having those perks :/

They removed the ability to use the punch bowl until further notice - it was addressed in the most recent patch notes

Have you ever heard the phrase “get good”
---
Ok, the second holotape does give out by saying "Bucket of bolts" and "unplugging it." Also, he says: tower, river, fork; which means we found the tower, but the river would the 3 crate be located in the river bed or on the edges of the river? And then "fork" ;there are about 9-10 cross roads, would the 4th crate be located near the fork of the road or closer to a building that is near a fork in the road?
---
I believe your stash limit has been exceeded actually is what is happening because when you add to your shop - the items are essentially added to your stash

It’s like 750ish with level 3 hard bargain

I've had a similar issue with water purifiers I've previously placed.

I can't edit the locks on them, because it says they're floating, lmao.

/u/AHeroicLlama Could you possibly do a map for each flux? As in a map for each plant type that will convert to a specific type. That way we can see the most dense areas to nuke to generate whichever flux we are after.
---
Thank you for your work so far and in advance if the "Flux Maps" are possible.
---
My results show otherwise. I guess my inventory could be bugged.

Maybe not what you're looking for, but this is possible using the existing pieces:

I’m terrible at that, especially with the new player vending. It’d take me a month. 🤷‍♀️

O ok thankyou

Thank you!

Yup I’ve been trying to milk them all week and I’ve only gotten like 6 to work!

Nice, thanks!

I can't even close my eyes and make a jump like that, lol. Beautiful shot.

I'm down for either-- name the place, I'll meet you there, and die first.
---
You are the worst assistant ever, and you're disgusting, Dwigt.
---
No it was saying workshop limit. My stash weight is at 637. I deleted a couple little things from my C.A.M.P. and was able to add things to the vending machine again.
---
I didn't think of this! I don't have friends...so I can't ask them...I want the backpack though! It'd fit my aesthetic so well. 😁 I'm sorry btw, I shouldn't be posting things while drunk.
---
Not really, they are buying all your unwanted items, therefore giving you the caps/money to then be able to pay the prices for specific items that you want. So where as you might get rid of 5 items to be able to buy 1 specific item you want. Yes they gain more from buying your items and reselling the item you want for much higher price, but that's also because they have more risk. Buying items that nobody ends up buying means money loss.
---
It's generally how real life trading works. If you understand the market and know what things are worth, you make money. If you've got know idea and just buying things for any price. You'll be left bankrupt.

Went to gamestop to get the game and the guy totally talked me out of getting it said there wasn’t a huge fan base anymore, a bunch of other stuff, and said that the game will probably be going free shortly anyways. Though I know they’ve been saying that for awhile now though.
---
To be fair, the positivity isn't surrounding survival mode. 
---
In fact, it's sort of the opposite.
---
Survival took a bit of a dive recently, but adventure is flourishing due to player vending.
---
You do you though, mr. full ap miss every shot. &gt;;^)
---
that would slow down the game no?
---
What the-- never seen this before: "Found World-- World Full! You are queued to join."

So...I'll join you when I can.

Just revive a random in a nuke zone. It’s what I did.
---
My camp budget is full and I haven't had this problem.
---
Mmm, glowing mushrooms and ground molerat on the combo.
---
You can't tame deathclaw, sloths and a few others anymore I believe. You can take Mirelurk kings and hunters now though. :(
---
But you shouldn't worry. There are "apparently" millions of players, many of which don't trade off their good items in the vendors (such as myself), with items constantly going into the economy through loot drops, and peoples wants/needs changing due to nerfs/buffs/updates. They would never be able to monopolize the market.
---
Just got kill some mole miners for black titanium. I always get like 30 to 50 pieces after doing Uranium fever.

I love it.

Dropping that angry emote when you see they’re selling fusion cores for 1000caps each

No problem

It's a glitchy buggy RNG that needs to be fixed.

Interesting. I dont play a whole lot so losing a couple hours worth of junk hurt my soul.
---
Platform?

Im still waiting for them to let ya throw mini nukes like footballs while in power armour

Your best bet is checking scorch beast piles, mainly those around the fissure sites. Took me about 30 min to get 5 of them
---
U get a backpack but its a skin
---
A couple of my blueprints still work. A few are broken. I’m getting a lot of structure is floating errors, they need to get rid of those. Moving camp splits up an otherwise placeable blueprint, yeah. 
---
All these building restrictions they place on us in the tiny space allotted feel unnecessary
---
Hey sorry to be annoying but... Where is the course at the sunnytop ski lodge? Lol
---
That was perfect-- thanks, brother!
---
I understand. I've been there many times.
---
So I still need to complete the challenges then? I cant just get this and then craft a backpack?
---
100% my main is a gunslinger and I love it :)
---
Yeah man sorry for the misconception. I’m from WV myself and I just get tired of hearing the same shit about us being horse-fuckin inbred rednecks. Again, sorry for the miscommunication
---
I used a pressure plate with mine. It's pretty fun.
---
Do you follow a build? Or did you wing it?
---
These weren’t junk items though. They aren’t the god level items but still. Dude, or dudette, he dropped a grand on a chest piece that I used for months until I got my sentinel like it wasn’t shit.  The AP regen  was unreal and throw in the ammo food and drink buff ??  
---
I was surprised. If you have someone come in and wipe out all the good shit you have to pause and think, did I under price? Or is something else up?
---
#WANNA.  BUY.   SOMETHING?     CHUMP!
---
It’s a vats build. Max agility and luck, with all the perks for pistol damage, AP refresh, and all the critical related perks. Plus enough perception for concentrated fire so I can do headshots. :)
---
Thank you! I've been looking for him and dreading the hunt, lol.
---
U get the backpack blueprint for doing the campers quest
---
Ah so you are one of those people who demand to get what they want otherwise its a broken game. Shame ❤️
---
Easier to stop it before it happens. Also it’s not a stretch at all to think they’ll do it. Just look at every other game that uses that type of microtransactions. Look at the direction gta went and how stingy it was to earn money in rdr2 at the start of the game. This is something that happens over and over. Hell, just look at how the challenges to earn atoms have kept getting more and more complicated and picky. You can look at Bethesda’s short history in his game to predict what they will do.
---
Stash is 800 now. Read up on recent patch and vendor machines.
---
Okay damn. I hate these quest. I worked on one all day yesterday only to find out the frog habitat is bugged.
---
No. Took away my Buzzblade damage.
---
I found a camp earlier today built around a waterfall, with the water running through each level of the building. It was the  absolutely gorgeous!
---
I posted about this the other day. It seems we are getting double hit.
---
All i wants a backpack!! I have to find someone to revive as well. It sucks because I'm a loner.
---
Yeah....a few are bugged. Do research first. Archery and swimming challenges work and athletic
---
Any chance to make one for spawns?
---
Imagine believing this
---
Ask on reddit. People are constantly asking
---
I was gonna say calm down... but after reviewing the evidence, you get an upvote.
---
Well I got one done. The mammal one but yea I didnt think to research it. Who knew it would be bugged.
---
Sorry.
---
Yeah...
---
Athlete, swimmer, archer. Easiest way. If you need a hand then holler. My UK buddy and I will be on tomorrow on PC. nmprogue. 
---
He’s being stubborn about it too so we can make it happen.
---
Sometimes I place the items where it can be placed, in the vicinity of my desired placement then move it accordingly.
---
Have the same problem.   My guess, each item you add takes a sliver of camp budget.  It’s stupid but that seems to be the case.   
---
At least, that was the behavior after the initial rollout.  Could be that they might have fixed this with one of the patches, not sure...
---
I ended up removing a couple of items from my Max budget camp.   I removed a chair and a few plants.  I had extra when using Green Thumb.  I would have had to do this anyway to add a second vending machine and a wall for it to sit against.
---
What about the non hostile animals, like cats and opossum?
---
... I lost 1200 pounds of junk due to a server disconnect while trying to transfer weight around... I don't want to hear about your "hoarding" problem.
---
As a side note, the Plauge Walker mutation wasnt letting me milk Brahmin so I had to get rid of it. I was wondering why the Brahmin kept kicking me away until I got rid of the mutation.
---
Honestly they'd probably be lucky to turn a profit of like 500 caps on alot of the stuff, alot of it will go unsold.
---
Sent, assassin. Sent, chameleon. Unyielding. Bolstering. These are those items that go for large prices. But generally only if they are heavy combat or marine. I see Sent A, or Cham Sent, going for low prices on Reddit because it a leather light/medium piece.
---
Jesus, are we married already?..lmao. 
---
No worries, my friend. If I remember correctly, in the back. I know I saw the flags first before I saw the intercom.

Literally just requires a post on this sub or even just an open mic like hey rq can we knock this out lol. All this drama about a multiplayer online game not conducive for solo players is pretty sad. Lol. #DownVote
---
Idk Mole, are we? Stop playing games, I am a woman who deserves an answer. XD
---
You're not alone.  Hopefully, if/when they release private servers,  we can adjust the weight limit on on our own.
---
System?
---
Their utters are sore, make a fertilizer pit instead 🙃
---
I saw that in the patch notes though it dosen't seem to be working for mirelurks either
---
I just asked a random dude and he killed himself for me. Good times
---
Found it, thanks a bunch!
---
I dont think it is taking up any actual camp budget when you add items for sale. I think its a bug with the vending machine since it itself is a C.A.M.P. object. Like it replaces itself everytime you add something, so if your budget is full it bugs and gives you the limit exceeded message even though you arent adding to it.
---
People are relatively nice in the community. Glad u found someone to commit suicide for u lol
---
HAHAHA!! Dude, literal LOL right now. That was perfect.

Listen, I didn't want to lead you on but I can't. You're Xbox. I'm PS4. We're just too different. At least we'll always have the Pioneer Scouts...

After seeing all the camps people made, I tore down my 3 story house with a workroom floor, a lounge floor, and a bedroom floor, and instead moved further north in the Toxic Valley to the woods and created a new visitor friendly camp with a workshop warehouse and a lounge house connected by stairs on a hill with a focus on accessibility rather than looking like a house, and I am proud of myself.
---
Omg I didn't know they get sore in the game 😂😂
---
You have a chance to milk brahmin. It's not a given.
---
Honeybeasts apparently don't work... see the link I shared
---
That’s a great idea, I might do something like that in the future too.
---
Right now I’m just trying to unburden my stash box.  I’m not sure what I want to do once that is behind me.
---
I see most ammo for 1 cap per bullet
---
Typical price on the market (if you’re not buying through a person’s camp shop) is two bullets per 1 cap.
---
It's okay. At least we have the Reddit to keep our silly spark alive. 
---
No seriously thanks for the help, man :)
---
I just want them to fix the PvP weapon balance for this game. I barely even touch Survival because 1 shotting/getting 1 shotted is so dull. If they balance PvP by the time Nuclear Winter comes out, I'll just stick to Survival if its just a BR mode.
---
The type Honey Beasts drop can't be used for cooking. :T
---
You want the consumable. One spawns at the Middle Mountain Cabins, in a basket next to a grave. Another spawns in a bathtub at the very top of Tanagra Town, with some moonshining supplies. It doesn't spoil but it takes forever to respawn.
---
Where can I see the link at?
---
Now all I care about in the game is fiddling with my camp and stocking my store, I just wish I had my camp in the forest where more people would stop by but I just couldn’t give up that dual materials spot in the toxic valley. Oh well, at least I get a few customers an hour.
---
Still here, gonna hang for a bit longer. Come join if you need it!
---
do you still need help?
---
ok thanks
---
where do they usually spawn?
---
You're very welcome.
---
And thank you for the smiles and laughs. It's rare you meet someone who is easy to talk to from the get go.
---
Even 1 cap each isn’t bad tbh
---
This would be amazing. As a fellow crafter, I'm all for it.
---
I sell for 1 cap at my machine.
---
if you built your camp before the last two or three patches they've updated a lot of how the terrain and stuff effects the placement of your camp
---
The one you lose is random. TBH using a mutations serum should either add or remove that mutation depending if you have it or not. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way.
---
Just curious did you just happen to ignore the parts where he was lagging around or nah?
---
Just for the sake of game variety and balance.  In Fallout 4 you had weapons that were categorically worse 'starter weapons' like the pipe guns and that worked in that game. However in 76 you have the levelled weapons system, which makes having a category like this pointless.  A lot of these weapons people are calling to be buffed aren't the crappy 'joke weapons' but are actually iconic weapons from the series like the Laser Guns and the Shishkebab that people want to use but are turned off by the bad stats.  Besides it's pretty boring if people only used a handful of the many unique weapons in the game.
---
I was maxed on camp budget by adding vending machines and had no problem filling each one to capacity. There's no way I could have done that if the slots had anything to do with CAMP budget. I did run into issues with slots being full and stash capacity, but that was expected.
---
I think that is a fine price. I came across this one guy who was selling simple plans for thousands of caps, and don’t get me started on his weapons for sale.
---
i just want to smack someone with a mini nuke.
---

Happens to me sometimes. Enter West Tek and hear the dogs dying but not the mutants. Just another bug.
---
Watch the ash heap for breach as nd clear and lode barring. These events give you lots of ore like lead, steel, amd aluminum. All you gotta do you is smelt them in a chem bench and then you got a shit ton of resources. With super duper its even more. Oh and buy those maps in the ash heap.
---
Mine says “ass” because I’m unoriginal
---
Well I promise you this is not negligence on my part. Camp stash is over a 100 below limit. I have two vending machines. Each of them has less than 15 otems in them. I deleted a few decorations from my C.A.M.P., and was immediately able to add items into the vending machone again.
---
I always thought the caps part was dumb anyways, it should never have been a thing in the first place. Being able to set a bounty is one thing, having caps stolen because someone killed you is just dumb.
---
Spambeast gank squad
---
Remove useless camp items to free up budget if u want to add items to your vending machine. It’s not rocket science
---
[](/ce10)I had the same issue since the most recent update, I had a camp built into one of those big monorail support towers, and like you wanted to move things around to allow for the vendors, needless to say all my stuff that was moved under the arch of the tower got stuck up inside it.  
---
  
---
Couldn't salvage the build, and now I've got a boring hovel near the Whitesprings. If you figure out how to work around it please let me know.
---
I would submit a ticket. You are getting a bug.

Last night I was at whitesprings when the server went down for maintenance.  I get spawned into a nuked whitesprings, game takes 30 seconds to open my pip-boy.  Placed down power armor but it refuses to spawn in time.  Died from rads.

I know smartass. It is a bug though so it should be pointed out and fixed. Thanks for being useless.

No, it seems to be a bug. Thats how people are selling them already.
---
I'm having this issue, too, as well as with the fermenter, oddly. There must be some weird issue with the camp machines that display items that are stored in the stash.
---
Better Question.   Will it count when you collect them.....?
---
I did that for the first one. It seemed to pop up randomly otherwise. Does it just show up after a random entry?
---
How long will you be on?
---
Yeah it's bugged
---
Well shit. I don't want to sell it cause i want someone to suffer like I did running around for these challenges.
---
Let people play how they want to play. It doesn't hurt me so I'm ok with it.
---
It's possible that my Excevator user was a beta user, even though he completed the quest during the full game!
---
Or, a vending machine with 1 item in it weighs more than a vending machine with no items in it so they intentionally make it use budget space to vend items. Unless they specifically reply that it’s a bug it seems like it could be intentional. Your “idea” of how things “should” be don’t mean how things are currently is unintentional.
---
Other people trade it for a backpack mod they dont know.
---
I do installs for 500, add 100 if they need the leg. I do repair to 200% or build them if needed.
---
I quit in December with not much to do.  
---
I came back 3 weeks ago and am considering being unemployed to play.  
---
It's a lot of fun again.
---
:)
---
Seriously??? Weird but thanks! Lol. Guess I gotta go 3rd person now ⚔️
---
Thats what i may do. Shit now I'm pissed i spent 4 days grinding out challenges only for it to have been much easier to get all along.
---
this is the insight I didnt know I needed.
---
It really seems like consoles have a more active community than PC.
---
The daily events and camping event also have a chance to give possum badges. Roughly 1 in 4
---
Whitespring for XP and Legendary Kills, SBQ for flux and a queen kill.
---
Is "mysterious box" an item name?
---
The abundance of beaver is why I play.
---
No problem! Thanks for your help, too!
---
Yeah i know i got a couple from the event but i enjoyed doing the challenges as well. Gave me a reason to explore the game a bit more and do things i probably wouldn't have otherwise
---
Gotta ask, how effective is that for you?
---
Stepping on an actual cockroach in real life should kill it, but that isn't always the case. 
---
Just saying.
---
Don't have *that* much that I'd be willing to pay
---
still?
---
Interested in joining the scouts as part of your post apocalyptic adventure? You can even wear a beaver costume...
---
I sold 5000 5mm for 1c each
---
She’ll be on at least another 45 min or so
---
AP regen regularly sells for up to 5k if it's heavy and that's if the other stars are blah. Dude just knows the market as it is now. If he sells it for as low as 1.5k, he's made a profit. I do think you under priced. 
---
You can search the market sub for past sales of similar items to see prices before you sell if you are iffy, but if you're happy getting what you're getting then it is enough, right?
---
r/market76
---
There was a post from Bethesda here somewhere saying it was a known issue bit I can't find it.
---
Im in your world and at your C.A.M.P.
---
Just crouch twice, it's international for "I'm friendly"
---
And they’re only like 80caps depending on your charisma. Stop buying them from player camps for 500+!
---
I'm always overjoyed to find can traps, 9 cans woopwoop.
---
You could shoot the mantis oothecas in FNV, and if they had a mantis egg in them they would burst into about 7 mantis nymphs that you could step on.
---
Following. Just missing the chest piece
---
Hahahaha 😂😭
---
Finish the quest entirely before doing anything else and you shouldn’t have these issues.
---
I agree with your sentiment but there are some that are flat out useless. Looking at you chainsaw...
---
Don’t stress the deaths. You’re going to die for all kinds of stupid reasons — a lot. 
---
Bank any junk you absolutely need immediately, but otherwise laugh and embrace the respawn.
---
Those are all under 1000caps  
---
I'd trade em for Scrip or sell em for 1k each.
---
Serums..reasonably priced. 300 caps per. I was selling at 250 but had to raise it to slow the sales down..I hit max caps with those consistantly. I sell the urban shielded suits too..although I go lower than you do. Biggest sale was a stalkers explosive combat shotty at 7K. Bulk aluminium moves well, as does lead and acid. And I cant keep 5.56 in stock at a cap a piece. Vending is fantastic.
---
You know lucky strike mine yields like 400 or so lead ore
---
Fair point.
---
The next fallout game should be set pre-war here in South Carolina. Giant cockroaches, giant mosquitoes, mountain lions, bears, alligators. Nuclear bombs have literally fallen here. I'm pretty sure I saw a ghoul at the Super Duper Mart yesterday.
---
If you go to lucky hole mine you can get 300-400 lead ore at a time wearing excavator armor. Then you just need aacid, which the new campfire tales quest is a great place to get it. Or at the gold course up in the Ash heap
---
My go to place for them. Always above 75% and if you loot quick you can get one before and after they explode. Exploit? Yes. Felling guilty? No.
---
I'm waiting but not expecting some form of text chat.  I understand why they didn't add it, as it ads somewhat a form of realism only being able to communicate with those in range through voice, but overall it would help more than hurt.  At the very least a team text chat.   The few friends I have that are even willing to play this with me (as they know i like it) are hearing impaired, and I literally cannot communicate with them outside basic emotes.   This makes playing very dry and a pain in the ass as we need to alt-tab out to steam just to send instructions/questions. It really hinders the fun we have and we always end up playing other games that have this basic communication ability.     
---
I'm quiet surprised such a game in this day and age lacks such a basic communication tool, still.
---
Had the same issue, had you build the whole structure plus roof then add the stairs, also been having issues withbcertaib floors saying items are floating, have to remove and rebuild the floor panel to fix it.
---
Okay. I'll be getting on in the next hour or so and will look for it. If we miss each other today I'll look for you tomorrow. IGN: jchamlin
---
Right now it’s insane. Just saw three post for free winter man mask giveaways
---
True.  He paid more than I’m willing to give to chance
---
I love collecting unique kinds of meat and vegetables in 76 to make cool recipes so PLEASE Bethesda add this
---
Agreed x25,000 cause that’s all bethesda will allow
---
I have a shop with a tinkerers bench, and stash that is open 24/7, but the locked door with an "employees only" sign next to it leads to my private quarters. I keep my aluminum extractor inside, and don't want to come home to find it empty. I get annoyed though when folks don't leave an accessable bench for scrapping and a stash.
---
There’s an announcement about this.
---
Overall, anything under lvl 45 won’t be worth much.  Those of us over 50 will buy them on the cheap for trading in on scrip, but the $ will come from specialized end game stuff.  
---
Kinda up to you if you even want to bother vending them.
---
The best way to get possom badges is repeating campfire tales at camp adams. And the possom backpack is just a skin, I think the tadpole skin looks better and you get that one for free
---
Shit, you're right. Sorry, I haven't played my unarmed guy since like January.
---
There's also the fact that meat hook benefits from both unarmed and 1h perk cards
---
You do not need perks to install a mod
---
It's okay if "challenges" are actually challenging. Until they actually do anything like those other game developers have actually done, you can't argue "it's inevitable". Maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't.
---
"Make the game more fun so I want to buy more of it"- how are you going to do this when they've said all dlc is going to be free? See, that sacrifice, them adding things to the game for sale, that aren't essential to play the game.. that's how they're going to make money.
---
So how else do you expect them to make money in a game where all content is free? What right do you have to complain about things that haven't happened? Until it *does happen* you're just fear mongering.
---
I've gotten more than $60 value out of this game, anything else is offers me is just what makes me feel better about my purchase.
---
I did that after the tse nerf, got rid of 3 tse’s Gave them to somebody for free and stopped playing. I’m just now starting to get back into it as a melee so I don’t have to deal with ammo
---
You can join the scouts as part of your post apocalyptic adventure.
---
..while i was mass producing fashnacht donuts.. i just kept killing my brahmin and repair it.. i feel like such a fool....
---
what system are you on? I'm on PS4
---
And every other game is a massive open world with independent patroling/infighting AI....? Fo76 is very unique in its setting and design.
---
I never said this was a problem of games in general. But compare this multiplayer open world to other multiplayer open world games... GTA Online? No building, very simple AI that cheats. ARK? Talk about incompetent or a bad engine. Need I go on?
---
You can't compare Fo76 to other games, it's simply too different. You may as well say "but pacman is bug free, why can't this be".
---
Xbox
---
I believe the unstoppables comics spawn in the same locations as regular comics, it's just that the type of comic is random.
---
I’ve played since the week after launch. I’ve never even seen one.
---
If on ps4 I can help you? I've done it already. It only takes a minute
---
Two rabbits always spawn behind Whitesprings bunker. Everything else you can kill in a run or two of Campfire tales
---
You are not alone, still none for me either....
---
Sorry :(
---
Friendly reminder to include your platform.
---
i do switch between the 2 tbf, but with with my swing speed increase fire axe i defin notice the difference between 1st/3rd. 
---
its leftover from FO4.
---
walking with crippled legs also is slower in 3rd person then 1st.
---
Oh shit.  Someone else came by!
---
Then why do I?
---
Funny!!
---
I don't think it's the hardest to get considering every third person I encounter is wearing it.
---
I've finished all but 3 of them, Codebreaker (don't know if it works), Herbatologist (Frog thing is bugged), Medic (diffuser not in game).
---
For Possum challenges I've finished all except 3 Musician (bugged, instruments don't count), Chemist (bugged, syringer hits dont register on the 3 animals), Leather"thing" (forgot the name, working on this, Deathclaw hides are rng).
---
Faction based pvp.
---
Brahmin and sheepsquatch skulls worked for me, as well as "capless" and other sull parts
---
I'll have to check that out! Thanks!
---
Really? That's great, what sort of things? New content? More missions?
---
Uhh I've had no problems with this. I would suggest running a scan and repair on your game if on pc
---
I server hopped like 15 times before I found a flower.
---
Under resources I believe. Produces fertilizer and you can milk it.
---
Connect it from the other end. If that doesn't work close the build menu and reopen it. Rebuilt my base today, and did a lot of cursing.
---
I'm going to melee/heavy guns. They have been immune to the nerf hammer so far.
---
Ok I’m getting on now. Where do you want to do this?
---
Awesome, thanks
---
No maintenance until the next patch which is the 21st.
---
If you're on pc I'd suggest running a scan and repair through the launcher
---
both.  Underground dungeon added plus progression missions akin to reputation runs in other games
---
bigger carry for more scavenging, better social interaction/vending
---
just miles away from where they started.
---
And I hear there’s an hour cool down, so those Brahmin in Flatwoods are likely tapped dry.
---
Ill help out - I couldn't add you in game if you to try and add me
---
IGN: Bacchuus
---
I hate the 'best' way to do this is through self-harm / suicide, disgusts me.
---
[](/celbarassed)He might get lucky and get a nitwit like me who'll apparently spend 7k caps on a lvl 30 item since he forgot to check the level. XD
---
Wait until you get to the possum badges a few of them are bugged. Musician, Leatherworker, Chemist
---
I’ve read the bridge by the Charleston station is good for dying.
---
For all bone related challenges the best place would probably be the medical factory building east side of Mire. It produces skeletons and there is often a 3* max lvl Super Mutant and a magazine. Exterior location, no loading inside, ton of all kinds of bones, skeletons and skulls.
---
I only care about duping if it affects server stability.
---
I added you on PSN so I can join your world
---
Seems good but didn't they just nerf shotguns?
---
I'm on xbox, maybe it's platform specific. Sorry for the confusion I'll edit my post.
---
Reliable spawns at West tek and huntersville, also throughout the mire they're common.
---
Don't forget the wooden blocks and full paint cans XD
---
Thanks for the info
---
No worries. Even then if you're able to and I know it's a hassle but reinstalling the game might help as well
---
Wait till you start working on radium rifles...
---
It's tedious
---
I just made a new Char this weekend, going to be a melee build as well.
---
Is there more to it if you can pacify it? That sounds awesome lol like hidden dialogue or something
---
Well it's less that a large percentage of them are cheaters and more like there's a population of 1.3 billion so there's just more cheaters in general compared to the rest of the world because  they have 1.3 billion people.
---
Ive got some if you need
---
I would but I believe I'd lose all my photos :(
---
What's your accounts name
---
I see the cripple effect working fine. I just dont see any high DPS at all now out of the explosive side or the shotgun itself. It is a huge change from what it was before.
---
Can't keep magazines used to leave them in cans around whitesprings now getting 25 per and I find ten a day on my normal routes. Also 3* ledgendaries that were like max lvl mutants sentinel AP refresh trapper chest that I was trying for a month to get 5k out of sold for 7 within 15 minutes of the machine being on. Rarer meds like grape mentats are quick sellers and disease cures too. All in all loving player vending.
---
Oh damn! That's such a predicament! I'll do some research and see if I can find anything to help
---
Damn u r a good friend my friends and B.I.L. would just but a bloodied dragon or mole miner gauntlet just to say they have it and i can never get it how do i get u as a friend are u on xb1 by any chance lol
---
They contain holotape for future stuff as teasers
---
Do a ton of people buy your magazines for 50 too? I have no idea why they sold so fast lol, you don't get the challenge for buying ones you don't have.
---
Heck I got scammed out of 800 pounds of junk and I told them have fun with it.
---
A_Small_Sedan.  Be on in 10
---
.308. They are expensive to craft and you don't get many. My lmg is starving.
---
There's a thread on here about them. There's a second one as well
---
Ok thanks
---
I’m a solo player, but I actually found it really fun to find someone and ask them to jump off something high together so we could get the ‘revive an ally’ challenge. It’s really not so difficult and it was actually super entertaining to interact with other players after playing 99.9% of the game solo.
---
I stopped hoarding. I don’t pick up stuff that doesn’t typically fit my build. Now with the legendary scrip machines I pick up everything and exchange them ASAP. I don’t pick up every junk item I see I only pickup what I know I need often. Playing the way I do now feels less like inventory management and more like playing fallout.
---
I ran into 2 scorchbeast 5 cave crickets, 3 ants and a radrat all  at once at the antique shop by the brotherhood asylum and there was another scorchbeast in the distance.
---
You used to find lead in baby bottles too, then they removed it.
---
3*= 750 with crappy stats
---
2*= 500 "                "
---
1*= 100 "                "
---
tbh, just scrip them
---
Which then leads to "Where do comics spawn?" 
---
Gah.
---
Well, I mean lore wise a sorry emote could just be waving the Canadian flag. No disrespect to the US's hat. Love you guys.
---
They nerfed pvp to death in standard and it costs more to fast travel in survival than you get for a kill. I hope something gives soon because joining the scouts is boring.
---
thats a really good price
---
With the current market i have to pick everything in order to sell and acquire good gear. There's no way for me to farm 30-50k caps to buy a single weapon...
---
I saw fasnacht masks, like regular drop ones, getting sold for upwards of 3000 caps.
---
the gauntlets are insane tho
---
Want a TSE Handmade
---
Have to relog or maybe server swap.
---
That's really nice of you thank you! I've looked around myself but couldn't find much unfortunately, if you happen across anything though let me know but don't worry about it if you don't!
---
Let me know if you ever need help with anything
---
No one believed you actually have a friend, young sheldon.
---
I honestly would have rather paid for dlc. Or they could do as elite dangerous, you want the cosmethics, you have to pay for them, no earning it in game (then if you are enjoying the game you’ll want to customize stuff). And you are naive if you don’t think it is inevitable when it is the playbook of every game that uses these things. That is how they make money. Some are better about being subtle about it than others (gta started that way but even in the beginning you could see decisions that made the game worse that were there to push shark cards). On top of hat bethesda is already doing it, except right now it’s just for the dailys if you want to earn atoms. You don’t think they won’t start messing with game balance to sell repair kits when they already have displayed they are fine with making annoying challenges to push you to buy? I got a bridge to sell you then.
---
Vulcanthropy is my UN if you’re still on.
---
No I made a bunch but you can’t sell or trade them if you drop three on the ground they are deleted like atom shop items
---
Not that I know of. I think it’s like the cameras, as in you can’t even drop them without destroying. However, I could be wrong.
---
Still need help?
---
This is an amazing idea. I got a group I play with and we would really need this.
---
Oh try MolowaKeiki?
---
I've experienced this since launch
---
It would be nice to sell ammo in multi number units, like five or ten for a cap etc etc
---
Civil war graveyard on the dirt path
---
Why is this getting downvoted. It still is bugged
---
Data mining is making it look more and more like battle royale and team death match is where it's headed. It's a head scratcher considering the dud that is survival mode. It costs more to fast travel then you get from a kill...
---
What is "Combat Logging"???
---
Thanks man same to you! My fiancé is lower level so she may be calling on you soon lol I’ll be on tomorrow sometime. Come check my shop if your on and let me know if there’s anything you might need.
---
It's cause your stash is full, the item you put in vending machine goes into your stash and if it's almost full it'll say that
---
I agree but I don’t believe this cycle of duping caused anything more than the same server problems Bethesda has now.
---
[](/celestiafrown)I had to gave up on launchers, they're fun, and cool, but, you'll still have to go back to base after every 2-3 encounters even with backup launchers.  
---
That and the ammo kills me(12lbs PER mini nuke, and 3 pounds per missle that does the same damage as three 5mm shots from a gatling?) Which wouldn't be a problem with ordinance express except I need those perk points for hot swapping into a different weapon type when everything breaks, and I need to not be overencombered in combat.  
---
They're a mess, not as bad as Vfast Melee weapons, but close.
---
Also for the fashnacht doughnuts
---

I mean I don't have it yet
---
Xbox: NefariousPirate
---
I’ll add you rn
---
It's not even the weapon imbalance that bothers me. It's the lack of reward for a kill. 18 caps to fast travel for a 12 cap kill is sickening.
---
Yknow I have that recipe and I’ve never made it
---
They nerfed all explosives too much. In my opinion no explosive or two shot is worth it these days.
---
[](/cebattle)I never experienced an explosive shotty pre patch, but I will say that with my junkie build a junkies explosive pump shotgun, is far worse than even a junkies gamma gun.
---
toohigh2care420
---
ima be on in a minute. watching sandman q&amp;a from tonight.
---
they may not do that because new players would constantly get clobbered by Behemoths outside of 76 if a level 300 is in the area
---
Once you have the fast receiver and the long barrel you have them all.
---
There's a gift emote
---
My AAE Handmade is still good. The speed is what makes the difference. I pretty much just use shotgun to cripple limbs in nuke zones so everyone can get a hit in.
---
Two shot and bloodied cannot exist on the same item. both are primary effects
---
Oh ok thanks im too stupid to figure that out
---
if you're not a bloodied build the gun wont help you any more than building one on a bench yourself.
---
literally just server hopped again lol.. i was waiting for passerbys to messages for help for about 15 minutes before i made this post. Ill let you know if i find him again and he still doesnt have it
---
It's ok Bethesda doesnt really like to explain things and give us the most vague things to do
---
I was tempted to give it a shot, but didn’t in the end. I’ll have to climb back up and see if I could.
---
Yeah. I’ve tried playing many different types of instruments in camp and the listed locations. Not one of them updated.
---
btw your name sounds familiar i may have been in a server with you today at some point
---
no, unfortunately you cant.
---
Storing anything for sale eats your camp's building budget, it is a small amount but if you are at 100% you cannot sell anything extra. scrap something from your camp and then try again
---
IMO AAE is going to give you the best bang for a hybrid of both modes. TS kills your accuracy and in pve you're killing things quickly enough anyway.
---
Gamma gun nearly useless on ghouls or anything glowing.   Radiation heals them.
---
Let the player choose the topping to create custom food buffs
---
But for pvp
---
They rarely seemed to count for me.  Dd the quest a dozen times and milk them all each time, but only had 2/10 when I checked.
---
Think the Grafton vendor has some
---
Would just like to see a “tough” server mode or some kind.  All the map can spawn to max level of creature, and more dangerous survival elements (weather/hunger/thirst).
---
That's great, any reports regarding private servers etc?
---
Good luck.
---
I already got help but if anyone else needs it I'll help.
---
would explain why im suddendly dying alot more with my unyielding build that needs all the endurance I can get so my low hp points are as high as possible. will check later
---
One good spot I know is the sons of Dane compound. There are three comic spawns (under the watchtower at the gate, in the basement of the house, and inside the compound on a table to the right). With enough hopping you can find a unstoppables comic.
---
I don’t think it’s possible to gift/trade the broken prosnap deluxe cameras. I may be wrong but so far I’ve had 2 people try to drop/sell them to me and they get prompted with “if you drop this it will destroy”. I really hope they change this because I need it for the tadpole challenges.
---
(all of them)
---
how does one earn merit badges
---
Picked up a 2-shot explosive pump action yesterday, was excited till I tried it on some ghouls.  The spread is insane and the damage was pitiful.
---
Found 2, haven’t found the third yet
---
They aren't. Neither are 4 stars anymore
---
I've attempted and been unable to complete this quest twice. Ironically, the lore on the nearby terminals mention Chloe being broken and ignoring the child, Leslie. Either this is an intentional meta-joke, or unintentionally a perfect bug for this particular quest.
---
Did you ever find the robot legs plan? I've been all over on PC. :(
---
I’ll help anyone on PS4 do it right now

Can confirm: live in SW GA; tried to stomp a cockroach on the street last night. It kept running and almost made me do a split.
---
a fair retort, I am sorry you didn't enjoy it.
---
I can't play much durring weekends, but today once baby was asleep my wife had to go get something at the store so I snuck half an hour of play at that time. Since time was short and my character was at pionner scout camp I tought I'd help people there. I spent the half hour downing myself with grenades in the lake  so that people could revive me.   Actually had a lot of fun doing it.
---
you can track them too, it doesnt work the best but it helps a bit
---
Holy hell!! I can carry 325 pounds right now!!
---
Thank you my good sir! Greatly appreciated!
---
After two days of hopping for several hours, I can confirm they spawn in the display cases inside the building you spawn in front of at harper’s ferry (the one with the hole in the wall). Just see what plan it is (without taking it) and start hopping servers until it’s the robot legs. The display case that it spawns in is random I believe, and there’s three floors to check in the building.

You have bone worms. You've always had bone worms.

About a month back I bought the T60 calibrated mod for 420c for reference.
---
It's meant to be played how I want.
---
Yes. So have I. What I’m saying is the upper tracks are a different event spawn point from the one directly outside the station. You can get two encounters. The Station event does not trigger if there is a Camp outside, but the upper tracks one will still spawn. My point is an encounter WILL NOT HAPPEN outside the station if there’s a camp there, and the upper tracks one will ALWAYS happen, even if there ISN’T a camp blocking the station point.
---
I am a solo player as well and was bummed to see that part of the quest. I posted here and found someone within an hour or so. No mics and just a few short sentences back and forth here and we both got it competed.
---
It's possible. The new dupe method works at whitesprings
---
Sometimes I’m able to rejoin sessions by visiting the recent tab in the friends list or recently seen players. That works for Xbox, but idk which console you’re using.

Whitespring golf course. Go to the road entrance by the fissure site on the south side. Follow the road  into the golf course and theres a couple on the edge of the road

Been looking since the update came out i guess the tourist hasnt died in my sessions yet or any of the hundreds ive switched to in this past week alone ugh fucking tourist

It’s odd they’d do a collection of the 4 horseman without one. If you have displays youd be more likely to buy all four instead of one.

Yes I did it at level 43 with no issues.
---
Wow! Who knew a simple legs plan would be the hardest thing on the list? I'll check out HF. Thank you so much!
---
Your use of capital letters and punctuation is just... horrible.
---
I think the problem isn't one or two items now and then, it's literally tens of thousands of things being duped. It's literally the reason the rest of us are tied to 800 limit in our stash, because there's a shit ton of duped stuff hogging server resources.
---
Pretty sure demo expert only buffs the 20% dmg that the explosive dose. Not your guns bas dmg. But am not 100% sure on the facts

There’s only two

medical wing of the enclave bunker for plan
---
but i see serum's all the time on player vending machines

Buy it from the WS bunker vendor, 22K caps without buffs.

The serum I mean... the recipe plan will be farmer to get and can run into the thousands of caps lol
---
If you're on Xbox I'll give you a marsupial serum for free
---
I can craft them all, but I won't be on till later. Message me your psn and I'll add you.
---
I just attempted to that and you can not unfortunately.
---
Or at least more dupers. xD
---
I dig it
---
Bugger
---
I’ve had the other robot pieces for a while so I was surprised I hadn’t found the legs before either. And as an FYI, I’m not sure if the standard robot legs spawn there. There’s variants called “heavy” and “sturdy” robot legs (I found the heavy plans), but these will still unlock the leg pieces themselves and are not mods.
---
Anytime!
---
I've never been able to tame those. Which sucks since I want a pet fox.
---
I didn't die in the game until level 57.  Not bragging, its just not hard.  At all.
---
I'm with you on the bad risk versus reward. I play solo or with a wingman mostly. 14 caps to fast travel and 12 caps for the kill is pointless.
---
Squirrels and Rabbits always spawn up hill from the service entrance at Whitespring. Rabbits run away from you though so make sure to shoot it before taking a pic.
---
As for wolves, they frequently spawn at the Investigator’s cabin to tbe east of Whitespring. There’s a few different types of enemies that can spawn there, but wolves aren’t uncommon, so if you don’t find any when you travel there just server hop a couple of times until you get them.
---
Camps are one the best parts of the game... so glad they're gettin' all this love now
---
SysPlat?
---
Interesting read. If the bomb was actually fitted it would've been the difference between 6 injuries or the deaths of thousands of Americans. I bet the bomb bay operator's heart dropped right along with the nuke.
---
Did you read it okay?
---
But you can’t store it anymore (the cannon stash glitch was patched long ago)  you can’t hold more than 1500. So that’s not a reason anymore not when I saw people with over 500,000 before.
---
Constantly...... Three times in six months is hardly constantly.
---
No, yeah.
---
You're basically saying that a level 50 pool cue should be equivalent to a level 50 super sledge, or a pipe pistol the same as a handmade rifle. Even with the "right" build, things shouldn't be equivalent to the point that all options are viable.
---
Your dagger example is especially ludicrous. There is no scenario that a dagger is comparable to a super sledge in overall dps damage. It's categorically a weaker weapon. This is not a bad thing.
---
There's certainly room for say one weapon type to excel over another e.g. lasers against robots vs bullets. Some of the example weapons given though defy logic and reason. Otherwise, bb gun with the right level and build should be comparable to a sniper rifle. It's nonsensical on the face of it.
---
I’ve sold every one of my spare T60 calibrated shocks for 1k. Just the mods.
---
I would prolly price the modded legs @ 1500.
---
Block them and move on. They’re being stupid and immature.
---
So do you think the people selling dozens of the same 3* Legendary weapons came by them naturally by playing the game? And do you think only one or two people do that? 
---
Cause I have the feeling it's not come by honestly, and it's a LOT of people that have these items.
---
Yeah, I kind of hate myself for criticizing based on capitalization and punctuation.
---
I get lazy and buy them from the enclave
---
Not only for doing stupid shit, but also a non-aggressive way of showing no interesting in joining a party
---
They are.
---
Yeah, my biggest issue is it halving my attack power. I can't exactly go into a melee fight with barely any armor and expect to do well
---
Copy that
---
So minor spoiler cuz datamine content
---
There are terrariums in the game files that are for camps and count as dirt
---
Me and a stranger teamed up for this exact thing, and did the golf club then went our separate ways, are you on xbox?
---
Very curious to see this.
---
Awesome! What’s your GT?
---
And why can we still not see the contents of our power armor chassis?
---
The Clean Spacesuit is the hardest afaik.
---
&gt; Dude, did you seriously just make the argument for "real life" logic to apply here? 
---
What kind of dumb statement is this? Yeah, of course.
---
Naturally, it's not 1 for 1. It's a game after all but this game is grounded in some semblance of reality. If it was an absurd sort of game where anything goes, sure, have your pool cue be just as powerful as a rocket-powered sledge hammer but this is not that game.
---
The thing with the TSE shotgun is you need 
---
1) the shotgun damage perks
---
2) the explosive perks
---
3) the shotgun perk that prevents the pellets from spraying everywhere.
---
Compare that with a TS AA gauss or lever or handmade.
---
I went to a camp yesterday that was basically it’s own small town. It was incredible.
---
Yeah. Its reddit, not a english final.
---
max out all damage you can
---
I think the damage indicators on explosives are just fucked in this game. The missile launcher gains 1 point of damage in the pip boy if it's two shot (or the bunker buster, which has a +20% damage effect). The auto grenade launcher seems to show doubled damage with two shot. The fat man MIRV mod shows the damage of each individual cluster instead of the total. The only one that's relatively normal is the m79, but it used to benefit from shotgun damage perks as well as demo expert, sooo
---
And all of these are very misleading too. Without any perks, a missile launcher will show like 150 dmg or something and still one-shot you if you shoot it at your feet. It clearly does more damage than it displays
---
Yea
---
They seriously need to adjust the levels of the zones.  Far too much of the map is low level.  All of the map should be relevant, not just the eastern edge.
---
Hah i remember complaining about this six months ago and its still not fixed?
---
In your Challenges, go to 'World' and scroll down, there should be Tadpole Challenges and Possum Challenges (each set of challenges only becomes available when you earn that rank in the Pioneer Scout Quest); completing each challenge (these usually have a lot of specific criteria so give them a proper look) gives you one badge of that challenge type. These badges are the currency for the vending machines. 
---
You also have a chance (not guaranteed though) to earn badges from the 2 Daily quests, Stings and Things/Operation Tidy, as well as the event, Campfire Tales.
---
&gt; I'd rather Bethesda made my guests spawn at the regular camp spawn point. That I end up among the foundations of half the camps I visit can only be a bug.
---
Right? I spent an afternoon experimenting with my camp placement on my third toon until I found a spot that made my toon spawn on a [little rock shelf in a river, I then made a ramp and entrance into my house based on my personal spawn point.](https://i.imgur.com/6H0v9zR.png) I thought I was being so clever... then my friends fast travel to me and they spawn in the damn foundation. Well whatever, not a big deal, they rarely fast travel to my house... Then along came player vending and now it is a big deal because I've noticed lots of people spawning into my foundation.
---
Thanks. This helps a lot :)
---
I was thinking of doing the same for the Somerset Pistol but then again, never really used a .44 once I got a decent sniper rifle together.
---
I have also observed this, ps4
---
if you dont have the things i guess its a fiar trade. but if you where to sell that TSE you could easily buy those 3 things with the caps you gain.
---
As others said, you will probably want a new serum instead of the recipe. Recipe = ~20k caps at the whitesprings bunker, and it requires some ultracite/flux to craft. Meanwhile there will be plenty of people willing to sell the serum as low as 200 caps
---
The Mole Miner Gauntlet with extra blade has been my go-to melee for quite a while.
---
According to someone else's math AA is almost a flat 28% damage increase because weird math. So AA is better. I didn't fully understand the math offered, so take it how you like.
---
If they get wanted they can destroy your camp. Just a heads up since i read a lot of posts when ppl complaining about griefers. I dont pvp ever
---
Its not your pc. I have seen this bug at Tygart before and am ps4
---
An easy way to get at least the first/main one is to start the Encryptid quest, or join it if it starts. People are going down in that all the time. If you're lucky, they'll go down in that little pond there.
---
I wasn't quite so lucky, so I am all but ready to abandon the 'revive in water' bit (funny, nobody responds when you walk up and say "Hey do you mind going over to that stream and killing yourself?") so I am doing the Mammalologist one instead - taking photos of a bunch of different animals and milking brahmin 10x.
---
You can't be this way.  I try to be around when i know people are looking simply to let them see what they are buying ..... If it doesn't suit their playing style, no worries, it was good to provide you a look.
---
You did a good
---
Planters and grow lamps.
---
BOS armor plans are 100 caps each, or so, from the Grafton station vendor.
---
Old Man Winter mask was duped to crap the past couple days, people are selling for whatever they can get.
---
I just made a general comment to ask for each flux, but now I see you are already thinking of that.
---
A map per color would be easiest for people looking for specific flux for ammo farming.
---
Insanity, happened on my main account 😢 Did you hear anything back?
---
Yes. I already asked to make cheese from spiked Brahmin milk.
---
I did decent. Didn't make it though. Got past the security door after finding the 15 mainframe cores. Then there's two assaultrons on the otherside and more. I was out of stimpacks, I was out of bullets and my melee weapon wasn't gonna cut it. So, I had to give up. I think with a little assistance and some better perk choices, I can bang it next time.
---
I made a run for it and failed. Did pretty decent myself. 90% I'd say. Def could use a friend next time. :)
---
I found that terminal shortly after finding the flowers and wondered this exact same thing haha
---
I have a nuke keycard if you want to go again if you want
---
What's the cool down on respawns there?
---
Good man.
---
if you're on ps4 ive seen dozens of camp vendors selling seruns for 200-300 caps. just keep checking camp vendors
---
Every weapon type should be viable. Every weapon in its said type shouldn't be.
---
I contacted support but they gave me like Xbox problems that may be happening which I essentially hoping for as a response so I sent another but haven’t heard back yet
---
I’m guessing Seneca rocks? It’s always interesting to see the many ways people glitch through walls and the signage showing where to go in.
---
OMG this annoys the absolute shit out of me. Coming back to my camp and every door is open. Were you born in a barn? LOL. Also I have no Idea why people lock their camp, if a mob wants inside they will just beat through the wall to get your generator. The locked doors really on keep honest players out.
---
That can explain why you haven’t been active on market? Just like me... I see good stuff but can’t bid or trade because of my account and I get a little mad
---
Head back to the safety of the vault?
---
Look in toolboxes around camp Lewis and other pioneer scout locations. I have three now
---
We should be able to store them in the PA stations. That's the way it works in F4.
---
No, they cant, they just beat the crap out of your wall to get to your soft chewy generator anyway.
---
On a side note, assuming you are talking about the blue/white old man winter mask,  it's absurd that when the Fanschant event ended there was not 1 single verified report of a dropped old man winter mask, now they are literally all over the place. That being said it's basically certain the mask is a dupe. If that doesn't bother you and you want those things trade away. As was pointed out earlier today by another poster though, the BOS armor plans are only like 150 caps each at the vendor now
---
I will definitely try. Also, what do you mean by other pioneer scout locations? Thanks.
---
Fire was patched out awhile back. I saw someone say the rug trick still worked awhile back, but I tried after patch 9 this last week and couldn’t get it to go.
---
Why it wont change anything, they will just beat a hole in the wall to get to the goodies inside anyway.
---
Was it that can u send a pic?
---
Kiddie Corner, Dolly Sods, and Camp Adams that I know of.
---
You could do something akin to this in NV. You could step on mantids.
---
Same happened to me. Guess we will never know? Gratz and welcome to the club tho bud.
---
You means things that disappear like magic stuff.  Without selling or scrapping anything but something still disappears kind of bug?
---
A decent amount of new quests, new events, new recipes, a few new weapons/outfits, camera, various CAMP items like taxidermy, new alcohols + associated questline, a new cryptid, backpacks, a few new and some re-purposed locations. Legendary vendor also coming next week.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Yeah that’s what I feel. Here’s what I think they should do.
---
1. Cut down the size of The Forest. Kinda weird how the biggest area on the map becomes super easy after level 15
---
2. Add space to Toxic Valley and Ash Heap, those places need more love. Take from The Forest’s vast area.
---
3. Expand The Mire and The Cranberry Bog westward into the Savage Divide. 
---
4. Make The Savage Divide more difficult. It should be called the savage divide for a reason, to divide the map between the easier and more friendly West and the brutal and difficult East. 
---
It should look like [This](https://imgur.com/gallery/XuHCydy) in my opinion.
---
It was heavily duped
---
I'm fine with exploring the low area zones, I mean my explorations there might not get me as much exp or whatever, but it's still fun.
---
 No I know that these god tier drops are probably in odds from 1 in 50,000 to drop. Obviously one person had to get these drops and they were duped in the last cycle. Whatever few and rare that weren’t duped last cycle are being duped now (dubbed legacy lasers) I know a great deal of dupers and seeing people running around and taking out enemies with good weapons and sporting the winter man mask after fasnacht being done for nearly two months is great in my honest opinion. I would say if there was an actual way to see player activity, like steam presents with graphs, you would probably see a spike in players this month. A spike in players likely means a spike in profit for Bethesda for micro transactions which is good for the company that I support. I base this knowledge off of XB1 looking for groups. Typically, looking for groups on FO76 is about 150 any given night, since Wednesday I’ve been seeing in the high 300s low 400s. In that affect I wouldn’t see duping as completely negative.
---
If you could leave an upvote on this thread I would greatly appreciate it and maybe people could see some of the positive value from this instead of completely hating it, but secretly rocking a duped gun/armor and/or apparel.
---
Have you checked the armor workbench?
---
You don't actually get a consumable plan.
---
Source?

Only 1 Hard Hat color to my knowledge and it is faded blue. On the other hand there are 8 different Mining Helmet colors. A link to them :
---
 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mining\_helmet\_(Fallout\_4)](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Mining_helmet_(Fallout_4))
---
I did. Can craft one but cant make it level 50
---
I had actually rebuilt it on Wednesday since i got the plans for metal walls. I did blueprint it. Then later that day moved camp and it was  as i decribed above.
---
Ive seen plasma cores priced as low as their condition percentage to a high of 300. Foolishly I didnt buy any of them and now I'm out of cores with no vendors currently holding.
---
Should I be worried about it being taken away? I didnt do anything bad to get it.
---
Do you wear yours around? I am not really sure if there are any drawbacks.
---
Truly, I have some overflow caps on my mules so I’ve been buying up as much as I could, but it’s tough cause my moneymaker is locked up.
---
The overseer, the private religious vault 94, and some of us are the only ones wanting to rebuild. No faction including vault tec (who just wanted to see the chaos of using silos) wants to rebuild. As long as the soil is inhospitable appalachia is still not rebuilt; but there is an answer! The only way to rebuild appalachia is with a GECK.
---
the fact that there was not a single verified drop of even one the entire run of the event, but now all of a sudden there are probably thousands of them floating around.
---
That sounds like the Falling Water house that Skooled Zone built [https://youtu.be/goqf9CNmIz0](https://youtu.be/goqf9CNmIz0)
---
If you are spawning in a bad place move your CAMP module to another spot in your base camp. It will change your spawn point. Not perfect but it works.
---
Iv got about 600 caps 😂 don’t think that will cut it unless I take out a mortgage on my C.A.M.P
---
I’m PS4 but that is so awesome to offer that. Thank you!!
---
I meant create a new world instance. So when you join a game you can choose either the default leveling areas or a "hard" mode so to speak, where the whole world is 50+
---
if you saw the tease for the legendary vendor scout armor and bone club will have lengendaries, and it was also datamined too
---
Damn, well it's a good community chances are you'll get one :)
---
Plauge Walker? I only really notice it when I'm dealing with lower level enemies (sub 20 maybe). It can help finish them off. I've realized though that I've never had more than 1 disease at a time when using it, so it can probably be stronger.
---
Is there any point to keeping these perk cards anymore? Why would they nerf these perks!? Taming and pacifying was awesome... very disappointed with this decision... Bethesda PLEASE let us pacify and tame again!!!
---
Thanks so much! I’ll be in the lookout. I only had it for about two days and now I can’t live without it. I thought having starched genes would prevent me from losing it, but I now see there’s a “chance” I won’t lose it.
---
Not spending that many caps on it
---
I’m on it! Thanks
---
You can actually fast travel to the same camp and spawn in a different place. I have done it several times. Not saying it's 100% but the few times I did it I spawned in a different spot.
---
You are correct.  Anyone that has played an open world game longer than 5 minutes could have told them that when they were designing the game.  They made the same mistake that pretty much every open world game developer makes, no end game, too much focus on early game. 
---
They just need to have a server that is level 50 and below (as the game is right now)  and another server Adventure + or something that is level 50+, the lowest level creature would be 50.
---
I really appreciate this post, but now I’m hoping someone makes a mega thread that contains guides for returning players. I’m finding it difficult to find information on best ways to grind for caps, ammo, xp, legendaries, etc.
---
Yeah you only have enough to buy the serum then.
---
Yeah I agree it should have been nerfed just not in this way
---
I'm sure it wasn't disabled. Likely just that I'm messing it up or it's glitched for me
---
That’s what happened? I was wondering why my explosive shotgun wasn’t doing as good as it used to. That sucks. I literally just got it too about 2-3 weeks ago
---
With the patch last tuesday, and because it was overpowered. They nerfed Assassin's in the same way too.
---
If you take starched genes 2, then it's impossible to lose. You can down all the radaway in the world while standing under a decontamination arch and you won't lose it. But you also can't gain any other mutations, except via serum. That perk is for solidifying your build when you know exactly which mutations you want
---
Move your CAMP module around your base. It will move your spawn point. I had a camp that spawned me over a cliff. That's when I learned to never log off without my power armor on.
---
Shoot I just scrap most my one stars that I don’t want myself as I figure no one will buy them and I want the scrip.
---
Ah ok, when they changed it so floors would clear and level terrain I had to rebuild parts of my base because they didn't line up correctly anymore given the angles and way I had built my base
---
I agree with you!
---
good new is unless i missed something the legendary vendor doesnt have a chance to give you wood armor
---
I like the way you think
---
I actually have 13 for sale for 100caps each. No idea if they will sell at that because I don’t even know what they are used for. I just figure something unique and similar to what you’d use fusion cores for. But with plasma.
---
Thanks again.  Yea , the data cap struggle is real.  I think I like your last sentence in the edit.  I think I’ll go that route.  If all else fails then re-download and just pray.
---
No.
---
I would rename it 'Drill' if I had one. Screw Bethesda and their RNG.
---
There are 2 vending machines at camp adams, the possum vending machine has the mods for the backpack
---
yes, after recent p
---
update cannot transfer quest items from other players.  :(  hope you get your camera
---
With the exception of my master bedroom no area of my camp is off limits.
---
We all need a bastion for our moments of peace and reflection.
---
Thanks I hope so too lol
---
superior sunset farm in cranberry bog is decent, there is a random encounter just east of the water on the bare patch right next the fast travel spawn point
---
there are also 4 other random encounters very near that one too, but it is difficult to explain where, just look out for the messenger event/care package smoke and those are the encounter locations
---
I can help! Gamertag- itsAlyxis
---
PS4? If so that might have been my camp!
---
People, will buy magazines for 50 but not bobble heads? Wonder why magazines are better (all I know is I had to put my bobble heads to 25 before they would sell).
---
Thanks, do you need it too? Not really sure what to do lol, any help is appreciated
---
What does it say?
---
Saying it’s duped is likely just referencing the fact that the item is no longer rare, therefore the price that person may be asking is now too high. It’s not their fault if they didn’t dupe it, but it doesn’t change the reality that the market is flooded with previously rare items. 
---
There’s no way to prove if an item is or isn’t duped, so it’s probably safest to assume that it is, if it’s one of those super desirable things. There will probably be no consequence for buying just one, but theoretically, one never knows.
---
Oh, I did not see that at all.
---
What do the different backpack mods do?
---
cownterpoint
---
Possum chemist is bugged for me. Killed a wolf with absyringer. No credit. 
---
Also the one with the frog habutat.
---
There really needs to be a full list.
---
Hmm.  Does that mean I can't give you one?  Cause I have an extra broken one on me right now on XB1.  Yours if you want it.
---
Refrigerator mod makes food items spoil more slowly but lowers how much you can carry, high capacity increases how much you can carry, reinforced or armor plated I believe it's called gives damage resistance
---
Straight into the main lobby with the giant rock in the centre.  Head towards the CEO's office - but don't go in.  To its immediate right is a door into a meeting room.  In the far corner of the meeting room is the cafe' sign in board.

do you know if the lvl 91 deathclaw version still attacks your base but does no damage?
---
would have to ditch my current pet just to get another bugged deathclaw
---
no.  keep the tse.
---
Oh my fucking god, dont remind me this quest!!!! I tried to do it on end of first beta day and before last part i DC'd and can't finish it, because daily disapear from your quest log after that. Well second beta day it happened again. I did this stupid quest as level 150 few months later.
---
Banjo is enjoying a more difficult challenge. How quickly did folks complete nukashine and the imposter squatch? Are players looking for achievements or are they looking for gameplay? The latest update, in Banjo’s opinion, is the future of the game. Promising upgrades players have to work for.
---
I've been on my Xbox for about 5 hours and only had one freeze up and that was it. Sometimes the Xbox needs a restart.
---
wot isnt it a post apocalyptic wasteland and the point of no human npcs was to have bad players and good players act as the npcs?
---
It’s perfect for me when some lv 200 jerk kills a legendary before I can get a shot in. But generally, yeah I’d agree
---
Maybe so. A nice location south of Sods. I don’t have any perks invested in camp defence yet, so at the moment I’m camped by the overseer’s cap!
---
This. Fuck the guy that thought 500 was too much.
---
Prices listed above are market standard.
---
Yes...yes you can and it is glorious. Have a friend run in and pull the entire clubhouse and then you play "catch" with your friend. Nuke down, Vault Dwellers win!
---
I tried to pacify a scorch beast today and didn’t get the option to and read this thread then the patch notes sloths, deathclaws, scorched beast and feels like everything else is no longer tameable or can be pacified. I put a ton of points into charisma and maxed out animal friend and whisper just so I could do this. Feels like a big let down.
---
Probably nothing to worry about, but lots of people know it was heavily duped, so wearing it may get you reported as a potential duper. 
---
I doubt anything would come of that, but wear at your own risk. Personally, I’d drop it in a pond and leave the server.
---
Thank you I was so confused
---
I leave all the crafting outside, since I personally like the immersion of it being an owned house.
---
It could have been mine! I found that location casually the other day and worked really hard to build a camp around the waterfall. Figured maybe it was a unique enough spot because I always load it in when I boot up the game, but after reading this thread I guess it’s a somewhat popular spot haha.
---
I had problems with the tadpole syringer quest, you have to kill it solely with the syringer and dont use vats as having my savior come help was the problem I think
---
Guilty until proven innocent lol

Greater Faydark 😂

What is the point of PvP without a reward?
---
It just got turned on.
---
Dc's gave been really bad the last two days. Now tonight off the rails again.
---
My guess?
---
Duping bug bisn't fixed.
---
That's the only time I've seen them crash this much.
---
It's supply and demand. I have the supply and there is demand for room in my full stash and my character being 10 from overweight demands sale prices. Pretty much it in a Mierluck [Shell. So](https://Shell.So) everyone come to RB1955's shop for good deals. You can find me on the ski slopes at Top of the World. Lots of shotgun shells if you need them. Two full vending machines with a little of everything.
---
No, it’s actually in somewhere else I don’t want to tell
---
Is that your PSN? Or a cleverly spelled retort?
---
Negative ghost rider, backpacks come with anti tamper technology. The Enclave will automatically be notified if any unlicensed vault dweller tries to equip a backpack. A nuclear....deterrent will be sent to....handle the situation.
---
Agree a sorry emote plus a laugh emote
---
Survival?
---
Many people, (myself included), haven't been able to get dailies in The Mire region for a couple patches now. Only zone I can't get any of them to pop. If you're in our sorry group, my sympathies.
---
I think you're deluding yourself into thinking it's fine, by saying it's causing people to play the game. Do you think people go to eBay or whatever, buy a duped weapon before they even buy the game? No. 
---
I don't really care if things are duped, but it's pretty crazy to think the reason people are looking for groups is because they bought duped items. Like where do you even make that connection? 
---
And of course dupers know other dupers. That doesn't mean everyone is a duper, it just means your group is dupers.
---
both
---
If you cook them they sell for a good price too.
---
Lol, why you are being downvoted? Do people remember there was window with loot when you was looking on stash, that was deleted because stability?
---
Autoloot feature would make game unplayable again.
---
Then how did you know it had a working landmine strapped to it?
---
I was one of those people &amp; what I was referring to is the caps amount. A direct trade for items is fine.
---
Yes I should have direct messaged instead of possibly ruining your trade - I'll delete the comment
---
That's a good point, but I still think it's kind of scuzzy in a multiplayer game to run around with ill gotten god tier items.
---
Fox 100% spawn at bbq shack, where free states event starts. Try it
---
Could be random or buggy? Had the Mrs try to get it as well and she also got the junk version.
---
Would be cool if thats what the nuclear winter new mode is gonna be
---
Dang, seems like there would be a third.  Maybe it’s coming later.
---
If you join FO76 Market places in Facebook there are a few groups out there that seem to be infamous in them for duping. The "Beach boys" are often referenced. I don't pay too much attention to the group since I've only done a single trade on it. 
---
Forewarning the most of the people in the groups are pure cancer and have no clue on general pricing.
---
What? Im new and i dont get it. Dont you have to fight back then its on? I had 1 guy in power armor and lvl 63 try to hit me... I almost shot him but im in the middle of this quest. He wacked me a few times then logged out. I thought survival mode was were ppl go to shoot eachother?
---
I believe it is more a limitation of their tech than a choice they made.
---
nope :(
---
I came here to ask this, read farther down and will try this.
---
Time to have a laser party!
---
This game is so pure sometimes
---
As much as that would be kinda cool, they dupe for that reason. They want quick caps.
---
Oh were you the guy that commented on my post no what you did was mild you're good I'm talking more witch hunting anyhow there are absolutely no hard feelings here
---
I did the vertibot at grafton steel yard workshop. One appears when you repair the helipad there.
---
Pizza time.
---
I just scrapped 2 three star pistols I had up for under 500 caps. No interest and I needed some room. Got a Bloodied Missle launcher with stabilizer and Targeting computer. Will put a quad barrel on it for another 100 caps. But machine doesn't show the mods. Whoever buys that will be happy.
---
It buffs explosive dmg. Not worth 5 points anymore
---
touche.
---
I've had this happen on PS4. Not every time but still happens
---
If only there were some sort of internet based community where you could talk about games like this and find like minded people who are in similar situations or just helpful...nah, that just sounds silly when I think about it.
---
Not much since for the furious effect to work you have to consecutively hit the target without reloading. But with the harpoon you reload after each shot.
---
I'm still able to build them, just checked it. That fix was about duping glitch afaik.
---
They sometimes do give some away.
---
Just wondering what they do with all the caps.
---
Nothing's rare anymore, so the caps can't be spent. 100k items are going for 7k.
---
Wondering if they sell the caps to the websites who then on sell.
---
If we could get rid of those websites, then maybe duping wouldn't be as popular?
---
Are you level 50?
---
Did you actually select the item to craft at the work bench?
---
Are you still on the same server?
---
Rug is real finicky
---
Only works at the far edges, just not worth it
---
I just priced them at the 162. A few items I reduced the price some and a few I raised a little. My personal thoughts on their value. Certain plans sell very fast. I may need a price increase when I restock them. 100 caps is a bit cheap for a plan that sells the same day you stock it. Like every time... gone instantly!
---
i had to use a Small Generator to get it to work. gl
---
Would be great if we could store armour on the frames and stash them, even if we can’t use that armour yet.
---
Currently for me, t45 no problems, but t60 all needs to be stored as seperate pieces.
---
Yes. I was able to get it pretty easily once I figured it out before. However, after this last patch, no matter what I did, I couldn’t get it to take. Maybe I was just having a bad day.
---
HentaiKing808 gt , doing tadpol quest
---
Why not just expand the map itself, instead? After all, all the areas you listed (other than SD, which is pretty well proportioned already) could just expand more towards outside the edges of the current map, without encroaching on existing map.
---
On the other hand, what some of those regions really need is more content in the already existing land, more than anything.
---
RB1955. On PC. Will be on Most of Sunday. I have 15 cores up for grab's.
---
Well that sucks. And I dont have that perk.
---
I'm level 150ish. Selected backpack under crafting. Can only craft a level 1 backpack. 
---
Should I put a ticket in with Bethesda?
---
Lawl
---
The power armor stations should be lockable with your armor in it.
---
I use a mod in Fallout 4 that actually makes the sword a 2hander and it fixed is for the most part.
---
Only if they’re adding wv’s famous pepperoni rolls as well. The pepperoni could be fox jerky or something.
---
I haven't seen them but I'm being prepared for it.
---
I found the keycard  it on a corpse 75 yards SW of the Central Mountain Lookout near Pleasant Valley.
---
I did, also tried to put it on haha
---
The  *Gatling plasma* uses plasma cores. Not a bad weapon. Mows down scorch quite well.
---
I would skip em, the campfire quest is fairly easy and awards a badge 25% of the time. If you really want to be a completion do em in 6 months or 6 years, whenever it actually just works.
---
These scumbags ruining our game are able to sell caps to people on Ebay for irl money. They sell to people who are just as shitty as the no lifes that scam these Caps. Then sell them to no lifes that dont want to work for anything.
---
Shame.
---
This is one reason why I almost never finish daily quests.
---
Oh, walk to the complete other side of the map before finishing today's gameplay session? Oh well.
---
I really wish daily quests didn't have to be finished within the day it was assigned, and that the "daily" just meant that's the lower limit on how often you can do them (as intended).
---
I love everything about this, especially with changing the grip to turn it into a two hander.
---
I find quest markers unreliable even with main quests. I don't trust they wouldn't bug or be confusing with all lot from at times dozens of enemies on different vertical levels. 
---
Also I've never considered the part of Fallout where I search in a sea of low texture browns and grays covered in grass for the tiny texture or body part that is the loot, to be fun. Loot all please.
---
Yeah man, put a ticket in
---
Always worth a comment to troubleshoot
---
🤷‍♂️
---
My caps fluctuate so much now. one moment i make 2000 caps selling 2000 shotgun shells, then i find a two explosive harpoon gun for 2000 caps.
---
Yea i agree if you follow th quest line the game and stay in you level area its a cake walk.
---
Happened to me earlier this afternoon. Did a hard reset of xbox under power settings. No crashes for 8 hours.
---
Wrong section
---
What
---
Oh my bad
---
No worries, just a heads up 👍
---
So everyone else can craft a level 50 no sweat?  Oof. I'll do that then
---
You are sooo getting banned for having it
---
Nah just messing with you lol
---
Yeah, mine unlocked and I could make the level 50 straight away
---
Wonder what the price would be if you had to buy them from a vendor bot? I could imagine. Probably 5 figures. Like 12,000 caps for lighted letters to decorate your camp with?
---
Server hop the Harper's Ferry house with the display cases. I needed robot legs and chest plans for Robotics badge and I was able to find the plans there
---
I have this problem aswell
---
Ammo   , i would never sell or buy over 0.5 each
---
My fix is running any direction for about 10 seconds
---
Try again, usually kicks it off
---
Thanks for input. I'll try again tomorrow. Maybe laggy server when I tried it earlier.
---
If you bought repair kits you will be down voted into the depths of hell.
---
Thought I was the only one. Ps4 btw
---
Let's be honest, unfortunately the majority of decent 3* items are only here to be traded as they were once duped.
---
I've only had 1 explosive drop in over 200 levels &amp; that was a 2 star. Still used to kill scorchbeasts with an explosive powder pistol though :) Just slowly
---
Exactly pvp is all messed up with people abusing their duped weapons
---
I just want to get the weapons in all honesty :(
---
Same here, infuriating!! PS4
---
I have your same issue, when i talk to mister handy the quest doesn't start so i can't check those two points of the todpole one
---
When things are not working right run the scan repair tool just in case. Usually it finds no problem but I have seen it find a corrupted file and replace it. Rare buy it happens.
---
Also it's cute.
---
For real.
---
Just a scrappable piece of junk unfortunately, though in one spot there is a small dog next to a dead body but I don't know where it was again.
---
Like 20 mins or whenever someone new spawns in.
---
Just east from the crashed airplane look for a lake that has a waterfall on the east side of the lake. There is a lead deposit just north of the waterfall place the camp between the lake and or waterfall and the lead deposit. Love to see the designs around the water fall area.
---
Ah thats a bummer. Thanks though.
---
Also side question, did helmets/hats recieve smg resistance? I thought the mole miner mascot head was the only one that had a dr of 1 but now my welding helmet as well as a few other headpieces do.
---
Cool. I generally just hop to the next world. I didn't realize you could camp the ones with good spawns.
---
They have them on Ebay. Real money will get you one.
---
Had to demolish my beloved camp that i probably spent upwards of 10 hours building, because i built slanted walls trying out something new and whoopsie doopsie they are floating, in the middle of my camp and cant be deleted.
---
Could you post the link or say where the third spawn is? Thanks so much.
---
Found three of them at whitesprings  about always find one in toolbox in the shop building outside the parking lot there where the washers and dryers are. Hope you can understand where I’m talking about  hard to describe it.
---
Yes. It’s a dick move but it happens all the time.

Scroll to mission to collect your gear, will drop you a marker

The thing is it should undoubtedly be heavily customizable for a melee weapon.
---
The way I see it,   any weapon that required schematics and hunting down materials in FO3 should have a special degree of crafrability in 76.       
---
The bob, gauntlet, ext ext are the starting point for this whole system and deserve respect
---
Pics available in this post I made. I don’t think mods affect the look, that I’ve heard of anyway.
---
https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmsqv2/tadpole_backpack_vs_possum_backpack_answered/
---
Totally agree. I always feel bad if I mess up something (thankfully pacifist mode is on for me), but like.. all I know to do is just kinda... leave and hope they don't think I'm a dick.
---
So you just prove what he is talking about. XD
---
Where's the different looks for bags? Werent there a lot of bag options to what it looks like?
---
Just a thought but there's two cameras in the game now. Wonder if it matters which one you use?
---
I’m going to go take a look, thanks. 👍
---
Yeah it's definitely one of the most fun social experiences in the game.  Most the time everyone is good sport but occasionally you'll get that one guy who jumps in front of your bullets as you're clearing out the mobs and then guns you down.
---
I have this issue too, i had aleready the quest before the update and now i can't do operation tidy and stings and things. Hope they are gonna fix that...
---
No way am I going to do that for a in game weapon
---
They were teased but so far there are only the pioneer scout, and keep out skin in the atom shop
---
Yeah I agree also I really hope you didn't take it as a personal attacks because it 100% wasn't meant to be also if you would like me to put down the post I'm more than happy to
---
Stings and things poped up for me but the other quest didnt. Its so frustrating i cant even get a backpack lol
---
How about coffee? I can make fasnacht donuts just let me make coffee now so my dreams of starting a post apocalyptic slocum's Joe can be complete.
---
Yes i know that. but ist not there. I guess someone else DID pick up the bag
---
I do as well. Name is ThisNonsense.
---
survival is broken
---
I was thinking this, I'll give it a go just to see.
---
Cool. Thanks for the tip.
---
Well... f that &gt;&lt;
---
Except other players have reported being able to add to their vending machine with a full workshop limit. You are telling me that it is a feature that your items for sale take up space in your C.A.M.P. stash, and workshop limit, essentially doubling their weight?? Going by your logic anything in your fermenter, resource extractors, and stash boxes would add to your workshop budget too. Get that stick out of your ass and think. Once again, thank you for being useless.
---
Nice one. Cheers.
---
People are dicks and downvoting so nm.
---
Probably the best update i got with this was the refund i got approved. 😂
---
exactly my point. either dont fight back or enable pacifist. simple. and if you want to take a workshop PVP IS THE RISK.
---
I can't get the backpack and the new new plans lol.. i hope they are gonna fix all these bugs
---
I can't even find the stage at the Rusty Pick, am I missing something? None of the instruments at Watoga High are working for the challenge either.
---
Also that! I only use it for mining ore now :'D
---
This patch has been inspiring me to build in some new areas, while challenging my creativity with building designs and layouts.
---
I too am looking for a complete list of Biv's recipes. I've checked my Challenges and I can't find one related to Biv. I'm guessing it would appear under World? The most recent recipe obtained was Nuka-Cola Dark, which I understand is quite rare. Is it possible I now have the full set? So far I have the following recipe totals:
---
Beers: 10
---
Mixed: 5
---
Spirits: 9
---
Wines: 2
---
What platform?
---
I usually have em spawn at my camp. Thats why i ask.
---
Facing the vault door, to the right is a small camp site (just sleeping bag and fire pit) that I just noticed this week. Anyone know if it's new? If it is could be connected to Mr. Redacted?
---
There’s a billboard near Blackwater mine that has a bunch of cats roaming around. The VOX quest from Monongah takes you there for cats.
---
The vertibird must be one from a landing pad that you summon from the helopads
---
yes it is known
---
Yes, Beam Splitter is essentially making it shoot 4 times the shots. As of current, it breaks 4 times quicker with Beam Splitter. The Two Shot Legendary effect works the exact same way.
---
Weird since I’ve gotten the miner badge already. Had no issues taking mineral deposit pictures.
---
I basically use the same method of junk storage, no more than 150, except the resources to make bullets, I've never had a stash storage problem since we had 600 storage :D

---
I can’t find a cat spawn for the life of me.
---
I didn't
---
It was actually the Black Rider PA Skin
---
I got attacked by an invisible deathclaw at deathclaw island the other day.
---
What this argument is not making sense. A player dupes a bunch of said weapons, sells this said weapon to the player base, then Bethesda releases an atomic shop skin for said weapon. People buy atoms to get the skin for said weapon. People will sell things on eBay no matter what, eBay was loaded with junk before dupes back in December.
---
I "almost" completed the archer mission but need to repair my crossbow 3 times? I guess I have to remove all perks for weapons and beat it against a tree 🙄 any other ideas to degrade a crossbow 3 times?
---
Samesies.
---
I lured a mob of Scorched to a level four newbie who was busy at a workbench.
---
I felt pretty bad about it but I did revive him and drop some items on the floor for him.
---
And 5 foxes at Fred's bbq also
---
Nothing is selected

PS4, psn = gefam

This was known, and fixed with the maintenance like yesterday.
---
Upvote for being able to spell fascist.
---
Where is the Mellon at Fred's? Does it have to be a growing Mellon or does just a Mellon work? I recall there is a Mellon at White springs in the club house 1st floor in the refrigerator
---
😦
---
Whats the point of even playing the game if you're just going to skip all the new content lol
---
So I also have a TSE one, with beam splitter.... Is that a really bad idea lol? Or don't they stack. Guess Ill have to test it later when I'm home.
---
Shame it works like that because with bean splitter and explosive, laser rifles are incredible.
---
I've seen this issue at WS, it's crazy. I usually will kneel down and melee away. It was happening so much I would pop a berry mentant so I could see them. I hope they fix it..
---
Took me a minute to notice the words on the sign.

This error is the bane of my existence today. Glad to see it’s not just me.

Wear mine constantly since the Event week. Nbd 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Im on xbox. Damn... I cant explain my camp cause its in the middle of nowhere and im in bed or id take a pic. Sorry bout that.. I'm sure if you google where to find cats in Fo76 youll find something most likely
---
Not fixed
---
But I am le tired.
---
Nice post
---
What about a dog? They are about the same size.
---
Good to know. I've just seen a massive uptick of people trading them today. Hopefully, these people won't find any other way to ruin the in-game economy again.
---
i dont even specificly need the shiskebab to be.. any 2 handed sword would do (id also love a skin for either the grognak or fireaxe (or both?!) that turns it into a street sign..)
---
but yeah, i use the war rider PA skin with the excavator skull helm.. and i would just love a badass 2 handed sword.
---
“probably thousands” ? Why would you say that?
---
Making a valid point against a suggestion that would ruin one if the mechanics of the game is considered unforgivable. 🥺
---
Oh no
---
If in real life you step on a giant cockroach, it can eat your leg off.
---
New info for me, I appreciate your feedback very much.
---
Love this, i really enjoy helping out the lower level guys too. In adventure mode it's us against the world, so you help others you help yourself.
---
Saw a Yao Guai moon walking yesterday
---
Only some, i can survive one hit. Sentinel armor for the win!
---
Repair kits will count too, how i got my 3rd repair for challenge right after repair and just a few bash kills (3-5) low level enemies, not sure how i getthem but i got a few advanced repair kits for the free somehow somewhere
---
The thing is, as someone who avidly searches the forums and subs for items, pretty close to everything that has popped up this week is clearly duped.  BE laser legacy weapons, god roll armor, super ultra rare plans and masks etc.  One day they were only being sold for real money OR trade, and the next day there are 1000 posts about having them for sale for caps.  And MULTIPLES of them.  It happened, the damage is done, and it’s up to the community to not condone it and don’t buy any of it.  Calling it out is important because it’s THAT obvious.  Have you seen LFG?  It’s a literal mess.  You can’t really say that there might be one or two people who obtained these items all of the sudden cause it’s just not possible due to drop rates and legendary drop tables.
---
That's been there a while, came across it a few months ago, dont think it's related.
---
Also you need only one of each, as you can scrap it and plant again.
---
My issue is the "you've exceeded the building limit" one. Added vendor machines and new items without expanding the build budget. To add to my camp i have to first delete... And i really dont have a lot...
---
It’s too bad we can’t bulk ammo like we can with junk. If I were selling a lot of the same ammo to one person like let’s say 1000 .45 rounds, I’d charge 500 caps. But yeah it’s pretty standard for 1c per bullet. 2mm ec would go for 2c per round I believe.
---
Poseidon Power Plant has 2: one is the front desk terminal (the with the Nuka machine) and one in the offices upstairs (the plant manager's terminal?).

---
Cats often spawn just below Vault 76 at the small shack to the left (not the bootlegger’s shack).
---
Im hopeful that this is right at the top of their list to sort out. Fed up of paying maybe a little too much for weapons just to see the extra perks.
---
You're not hearing me what I'm saying is some of the players just bought them and are completely innocent so no you shouldn't it's a different story if you look in the persons inventory and see 20 be lazers also are you saying all duped weapons because the be market wouldn't exist without the first dupe wave should people be shunned for having those?
---
That's how I got mine. Two guys were down at the end - one I nearly tripped over - and I managed to get it done.
---
This is a great idea atm. Also what's the refresh timer on that event? 
---
Pretty sure I haven't had a single badge or token whatever you call them from that event though.
---
thx!!
---
I’d also like to know this. And there is what looks to be a transmitter on the back of it?
---
They tickle.  (Dense  chest,  max fireproof). The are irritatingly hard to shoot because they keep pushing me off aim.
---
Its every night as soon as someone approaches, you can server hop for quick turn our, I think you need to be a possum scout and then its only about 25% chance
---
I’m sorry I’m having trouble understanding this last part.  What are you saying? 
---
And as for the first part, you clearly knew that a duping glitch was opened this week.  If you read reddit, post on reddit, it was every other post for a minute there.  If you bought something to resell it, you’re kind of a idiot and not really innocent.  Before?  Yes, the first dupe gave a lot of things to a lot of people.  But it was more extreme this week because the market started dwindling and everyone’s duped items started running out.  Now all of the sudden the market is flush with everything again.  I’m not saying that if you bought something you should be banned, but it’s very very unlikely you “didn’t know what you were buying”.  Unless you’re a level 5 with one character and started playing 5 minutes ago.
---
They're not being smart if they're angry about you selling it cheap.
---
I literally ran the cloth section of the Silvermoon EU AH years ago, by spending 3-4 hours a day monitoring if people would put up cloth cheaper than me. Then I'd buy it and sell it at my own price.
---
As long as you have enough gold to keep buying whatever gets put up, you can just keep going.
---
I was also the first to reach the gold cap in vanilla back rhen: 214748g 36s and 47c :P
---
Nope, there's no solid conclusion after the last tape here she's talking about being injured after the miner attack. Confused me at first too
---
The shack east of harper's ferry accros the river.
---
There's a plague doctor mask that was datamined. It looked like you could wear a hat with it
---
Ahh, must have just been unlucky then as I've done it 4-5 times as a possum and still nothing. Will try again later. Thanks
---
Explosive harpoon gun?! That's my dream.
---
You need to run gunsmith to get any level of use out of weapons. Also, you don’t need to keep weapon artisan on all the time. Only when you’re actually fixing the weapon.
---
Yeah I think they did I have a heavy build so I will not be a problem seeing how much dmg it dose after getting one card of all 3 shotgunner to see what dmg it dose. It dose just over 180 with the explosive cards max out on.
---
I’m really hoping for it
---
This is correct. :)
---
Billings homestead -- lots of razorgrain, it's a farm.  You can make 10's of Brahmins.
---
Alot of the animals you need for that challenge spawn near the overseers camp including the cat, a bit of server hopping should get you a few things you need
---
Everyone making fun of the Canadians is a bit much. I play with one and he's a dick. Fights dirty like us Americans.
---
Or you could just have seen a deal at the start and thought it was fair bought it then got accused also do you have a be weapon of any kind because if so it was probably duped
---
are you a vampire?
---
What the fuck are these people talking about 5 months ago. One of them told this dude you can get a backpack!
---
There are 2 named cats.
---
From the wiki:
---
A cat named Murgle can be found northeast of Welch station.
---
A cat named Cheswick can be found at the Wixon homestead.
---
I think I've seen your camp. I wore a clean spacesuit and a mining helmet with a red lamp. Took a picture of you next to the waterfall in your bunny helmet.
---
Maybe a new game mode just like this will arrive one day, nuclear winter maybe.
---
This. You can get 5-6 from the 3 bots near the main entrance and server hop if you really need more.
---
I just do it when I log off anyway or have to server hop.
---
If I'm in for a longer session I'll grab all the power stations though.
---
Don't even lock them, they generate a core each every 5min or so.
---
What weapons are you looking for?
---
?
---
That's why they had the maintenance though.
---
They didn't delete duped stuff, or ban anyone, just stopped it from continuing afaik.
---
Unless this guy has some sort of evidence, which i'd love to see.
---
I think shotgun shells and fusion cells are well worth a cap each tbh due to needing plastic and copper respectively. 
---
But I'll only pay a cap each for 556 or 45 if I'm desperate.
---
Backpack mods along with other cosmetics
---
yeah i know lol thats what im saying lol, yes i do equip when i repair and like literally 1 clip? like 13seconds of weapon life? is that really intended if i choose not to run gunsmith lol
---
Smallville
---
Quit your whining. If your a food build than don't pvp, continue to carry 1000 dog food and junk in your excavator. Pvp people need something to call our own. You have the adventure mode severs and the pvp severs to your selves let us have this.
---
I would be inclined to believe that, if it wasn't for the unscheduled maintenance, and lack of bans.
---
I wish people would take my .308 off of me but alas it sits in my STASH waiting for the day it’s sold
---
Yes. I was chewing through gun condition like crazy until I got gunsmith up to 3.
---
When you fast travel to Harpers Ferry it places you right next to the train engine, climb up on top of it and head towards the front and inspect the whistle, will give you an interact prompt to blow it.
---
I worked at Atlantic City casinos for surveillance. And what we used to do was keep a cheater under observation to learn how they were cheating and then spring the trap. That allowed us to close the holes in our system.
---
From datamined voice logs of new content, we can asume, there will be battle royal mode.
---
You missed what I said, again.  MOST ITEMS in the game are duped.  Almost everyone has a duped weapon, BE, TSE, legacy lasers, etc.  The point I was trying to make was that this week in particular, after the market being dry for months, these weapons showed up again in excess because of a duping glitch.  And you “saw a deal” and bought one of them, listed it for sale immediately I’m assuming?  I think you’re not getting what I’m saying.  You bought a weapon that was duped this week and people are accusing you of duping because everyone is selling them.  It’s not that far off of an accusation if you’re including yourself in the wave of sellers that all of the sudden have these weapons again.  At least wait to post it.  That eliminates most of what you’re saying.  Or, don’t BUY IT.
---
Your argument was dupers are making people play the game. That's what doesn't make sense.
---
If I had to guess, it’ll be next week.
---
I usually type the code on a wall somewhere slightly out of sight or put a switched pylon in a doorwal then turn it into a wall and put a plant in front of it. That way they'll feel clever when they figure out to open it :)
---
And yet you want the same weapon....
---
I unlocked the monocle back in the day and love it with just about every hat possible
---
This.  Exactly what I’m saying.  👍🏼
---
At least we can rename them, which is nice.
---
A face-palm emote could be used for this. And other times.
---
Once went into a guy's camp with a buddy and he locked the doors so we couldn't get out.
---
Swapped to my Daisycutter (MIRV Fatman with weight reduction) and told him I'd get out one way or another. Opened the door, no problem lol
---
I would buy them off you if I came across your camp as I do not have that mod.
---
You have 2 accounts to mule but you still drop bags to transfer? That’s some crazy shit yo. 
---
Never ever trust the server, never ever trust a bag.
---
Good luck in the future.
---
One no I'm the the one being accused one person said a price the but two and the main thing is bought it before I even found out about it and I paid 18 hence the  deal
---
This appears to have significantly improved with the most recent patch. However I'm not sure why we need to see Checkpoint displayed, since we assume that is all happening in the background in an always online game. Picky I know but I'm beginning to feel invested!
---
i cant run this i dont hav the points, i can afford to put points into this, i dont want to put points into this lol
---
If this were true why not just buy and price up and resell?
---
Yes, it's considered an explosive
---
Fair enough.
---
Ohhhh really now.
---
Dude what are you saying,  I’m sorry but can you be more clear your responses don’t make a lot of sense.  I apologize but I’m trying to actually help you here.
---
Try setting your owned empty frame in front of you, then transferring the parts onto that frame via the frame transfer menu.
---
Then put it into your stash.

You cannot equip these parts, but should be able to store them on your spare frame
---
You didn't take a pic? That would have been hilarious as hell. Lol.
---
Well done friend, people like you make the community thrive.
---
How doesn’t it? People can finally get weapons and armor that will allow them to play the game solo. What would you rather play a game were you get wiped up by every NPC or a game we’re you can actually fight back?
---
Towny McTownface
---
That definitely looks broken. Only explanation i can come up with is that the explosive legendary  makes it break faster. And don’t laser weapons have a shorter condition? Idk don’t quote me on that. But that definitely looks like a bug
---
I think you mean Big Town
---
Biggest Town
---
Survivor's Point... Yeah, that's something
---
Possibly could be in display cases?
---
Looks really good my man! Love the rustic look
---
Think about it, the patch is next Thursday?  Maybe it was this: Open it up for about 24-36 hours, do hot fix.  Close it up for another couple of hours the next day due to exploit address, gives enough time to gather some data.  Form list of people that did it (I don’t think the list is THAT big but it’s big enough to form one).  Patch comes and it’s down for a bit, ban wave number 2.  Either that or they erase people’s inventory while servers are down.  Investigative reporting haha.
---
Max Fire proof means incendiary ammo won't work.
---
&gt; how tf am i supposed to say it?
---
In latin.
---
*~~ex abundantia in vaginas animadvertit has et aliorum hominum similis~~*.
---
Whoops, sorry, meant:
---
*animadvertit castores in abundantia autem non habet et aliorum hominum similis*
---
I lock my terminals with level 3 security
---
yeah, it's not like he or she told bethesda to prioritize this idea.
---
No. I don't play the game for pvp. And pvp is unbalanced. If this happened I just wouldn't join a faction. I don't want to be forced to play the game in a way I don't want to.
---
I wonder economics wise how this turns out?
---
The vending IMO is still gimped as it’s serverwide it should be available to all.
---
To outcompete eBay sellers
---
There's a pretty existing house that I always go back to and camp in, and since the latest patch things have a habit of teleporting onto the roof lol.
---
Work orders.
---
thank you!
---
welp, if you really want to take a picture of a generator/ore deposit good for you
---
I wouldn't describe such things as good storytelling/content. It is a time sink, and nothing more. I actually can appreciate taking pictures of landmarks or interesting places, but most of these quests content are inexcusable. 
---
The campfire quest is actually the best new content and I am not surprised it is the most rewarding.
---
Its always amusing to see all the heavy weapons in my inventory only weighing at most 2lbs and then seeing some rifle I pick up be 20lbs
---
Really??
---
Yea learn that the hard way and will never trust it.
---
And one day the Chinese appear and we all have to band together to stop them taking over? Fallout 2030
---
That's how it first came, as a glitch. Wasn't intended. Bethesda couldn't have done this, the game is going well and they can't afford to mess that up
---
I just saw a video uploaded 2 hours ago saying that the whitesprings waiter glitch still works. Whuch could explain the crazy amount if stuff ive seen in pe9ples vendors lol
---
I like the utility vending provides.
---
Good QoL idea, been doing the same thing.
---
I really have no idea. The trapper chest piece has a back pack, but it's just for looks. It doesn't add anything to carrying capacity.
---
lol i don't suppose youre still on i finally found him again
---
Brahmin milking seems to work the most when you sneak up to the side of their back end, like where you'd be irl. 
---
If you have the Brahmin Pen plans, building one gives you a brahmin that you can milk and you can reset it by putting the pen in storage then placing it back out. 
---
the S'mores recipe drops from the Campfire Tales event, I got mine today finally. I heard the rest of the recipes are available in Whitesprings, but I haven't gone to check.
---
I spotted a wild Mothman today near one of the ranger towers, but it was too close to where I spawned in and ran away. The Wise Mothman at the end of the Path To Enlightenment event isn't killable. Somebody was trying very hard with their gutsy blade and it was doing nothing.
---
Hunter worked for me - I had to finish the shotgun portion by bashing the Yao Guai with it bc I ran out of ammo. It counted! Found plenty of wolves in the Savage Divide near/around-in-a-wide-area the Sons of Dane compound.
---
Bloodied one handed weapons or rifles
---
But getting it legitimately is better
---
The game is going well yes, but banning a bunch of people that duped this week is a good thing, not a bad one.  It wouldn’t mess them up to test something like that to see who is doing what.  It’d actually help the game more than anything.
---
That point has outlived itself. 
---
Because it seems the fast travel point is systematic, players wanting to grielf with traps and such, can use the camp device placement for it.
---
Yet the players who don't want perhaps redesign their entire camp, can't avoid other players fast travelling to wrong place.
---
Pre built structures, that serve all the camp purposes, but can be contested over and won per faction? Have them dotted around?
---
Hahah what... what is a food build?  900 hours in this game and I’ve never heard anyone say that 😂😂😂😂
---
I mean if you’re looking to get rid of them,  I’ll grab one off of you.
---
Fridge mod, carry capacity mod, armor plating.  Go check out the vending machine at Camp Adams!
---
Try the shack that was part of the Cryptid quests. Supposed to always have cats.
---
Its east-northeast of Harpers Ferry, on the stone cliffs across the water. There's a farm over there that is a new marked location bc its one of the Free Range event end points. Fast travel there is probably the closest marked spot to get to it.
---
I don't understand most of this!
---
Hmm I got to go test that.
---
My visitor fast travel location seems fine, but I always fast travel to nearby road, under a cliff on top of which the camp is, making me require two fast travels to my own camp.
---
Like what is a food build though WHO IS A FOOD BUILD WHAT IS THAT Hahahaha
---
Did you hit the caps cap?
---
Also, anything less than a super mutant shouldn't push you 5 feet back when it hits you.
---
You could use radrats as an in game vehicle with how fast they hit and how much they knock you back that I've seen.
---
Yep. He was selling it through the trade subreddit
---
nope. not even close to 25k, i'm still less than 5k.
---
I couldn't get the named cats to work. I used the small pond with the jetty near the woodyard and hut south of vault 76. After a few hops they spawned.
---
Graham usually has them.
---
I got scared because I use Good With Salt and Thru Hiker and carry a ton of food and drink on me. What did I do?!
---
yes. i actually have a video of it happening. it's not very good, but you can see the amount of caps i had before the person bought my things, and then you see what he bought, how many he bought, and then my new cap total.
---
Omg you’re a food build RUN FOR THE HILLS
---
Who's graham
---
No mate, your fine
---
He's a traveling mutant vendor. He rolls all around the map with his cow.
---
Well learn to make 1 aquaitance you antisocial dweeb.
---
Nope. It's a bug. When you buy the mod you get 2 plans.
---
Ok,thank you for the help
---
Bethesda sucks
---
*laughs in chainsaw weapons*
---
Basically anyone who uses quality of like cards, ex pack rat, tru hiker, strong back, slow metabolism ext. any one who doesn't have there entire build solely focused for pvp, some one like you who
---
What platform are you on? I might have an extra copy. Won't be on until tomorrow though
---
But it's the same weapon
---
But legit
---
Dude I’m a bloodied melee shotgun build who literally eats large animals when I kill them and have zero of those perk cards 😂😂😂😂.  What are you actually talking about hahah
---
I've never gotten a duped anything and I can take out pretty much anything this game has to throw at me. If you need god tier items to be able to take on average mobs you're incompetent. SBQs? Takes a bit more, but my Vampire Plasma Gatling could solo one of those presuming the server didn't crash. 
---
And what NPCs? This game doesn't have NPCs.
---
This bug is ingame since beta. I personally doubt, that it will be fixed.
---
Can't lock my doors if they don't exist!
---
I removed all doors but the one on my afk jail cell and that's only there so I don't get chewed on while trying to fry some eggs or something.
---
do you pvp
---
This is an important thing I think. I don't doubt they'll fix ammunition's 1 cap per/minimum somehow.  But if they do it with some kind of create a set/group of multiple items as one purchase- then creating one with multiple of the same ammo would solve this example, and also allow for what OP is looking for; grouping separate items into single purchases instead of identical bullets.
---
The mod are now regularly sold for like 200-300 caps or something. Even before the price was the same I think, and they were on sale on the vendor often enough, that if you crafted them you just wasted resources. But now they seem like always or so.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
I picked up a set of hooded rags yesterday &amp; noticed this after putting it on. Hoping it's fixed soon.
---
Yes and I’ve never seen a FOOD BUILD in PVP servers this is just so weird LOL
---
PLEASE. I'm so tired of fast-traveling to my C.A.M.P. three or four times because i keep clipping into the foundation, or adjacent cliff face.
---
I think he means you.  Get out of the PVP servers ya food build.
---
if you pvp too than you should know what im talking about im getting the feeling that your not who you say you are
---
It's not that simple. If they allow display racks to be their own thing outside of the stash, then they're giving extra storage not to mention potential bugs including dupes. So the display racks will have to have armor assigned to them from something stored in the stash and that's not a simple import from old fallout to this one.
---
That's no measure.
---
Not weeks ago.
---
True, but yesterday I killed two 3 stars in a row and neither dropped **any** legendary. No other weapons, like drills, that cause that sort of issue either.
---
I believe that's where I encountered them.
---
And how did I know? They blew up on me as I was smacking them with a stick in power armour.
---
I wasn't looking for help but thanks anyway
---
100 for core is quite a lot actually.
---
I've had this happen from time to time with I have no idea what causes it.
---
Are you talking about the people who drop lots of food items when they die because HOW DOES THAT MAKE THEM A FOOD BUILD.  It makes them dumb for carrying that much stuff with them.
---
Console players disagree
---
It does need to be fixed, but it's neither glitchy nor buggy. The drop RNG is based on a seed derived from your name... Which is just a stupid fucking way to do it. They're giving some people crazy good drops often and others will never get them so the only way to get things distributed is to trade them.
---
I’ve heard that two shot weapons make your weapon condition decrease more
---
Bingo!!! Two cats there!!!
---
I've had the exact same thing happen several times now, but I didn't grab any video proof when it happens. Sold 571 Shotgun shells for 2 caps each and only got 114 caps from the transaction. I figure I've lost some 5,000+ caps now all from loads of small to medium transactions.
---
Glad you finally got it!
---
I had this happened when someone purchased 5.56 ammo and I didn't get a dime out of it. The system didn't even notify me that it happened I just happen to check my inventory and it was gone and no caps.
---
Huh weird. No matter it was still a fun takedown. I got the quest rewards at least 😎
---
Don't forget Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer for taming pets.
---
you deleted your bro you need to chill comment so I edited my response to not include caps and will only type in small letters from now on.  i’m laughing at the food build comment more than anything lololol
---
I've lost maybe about 10 things to this bug so far... They had it fixed for a while (or at least I didn't have it for a while) then it came back this patch with a vengeance. I've lost more stuff since patch 9 than I had since launch.
---
It's your atom shop paint doing it. But if you put it as whole power armor, players can't see what it has, so they aren't likely to buy it.
---
The amount of posts by people who are selling them, offered them in trades, and just being found stashed. I have read multiple post where multiple people in each post have said they randomly came across one in a suitcase. It's all been within the past couple days. That sudden spike from literally zero to that many people suddenly having or seeing them leads me to believe there are probably thousands floating around now.
---
Make undestroyable machines. pls.
---
Source on this?
---
I don't like buying half-damaged items unless it's for scrip and a good price. Also, it's at 200% durability. It'll last them quite a while.
---
0-100
---
This all would have been avoided if they used Steam.
---
Yeah, I noticed that, too. Was pretty bummed cause it was the perfect outfit for my savver alt.
---
Zero interest in BR.
---
What? lol just put the pieces on the frame and then let it time out. It'll take 60 seconds but then you can put it away without being able to get into it.
---
I am interested to check out the lore of the new vault but really don’t care for pvp in 76 and I don’t like battle Royale games. I enjoy the Fallout series for its world building and lore so I’m really hoping they still pack Vault 51, assuming the leaks are correct, full of it. If players can take in their own weapons and armour I think it will be dead on arrival as it will just be full of assassin/cavalier stealth users with two shot explosive weapons. They might be able to make it work but I would of taken some expansive story driven pve combat any day.
---
I am level 155. Never played in a group before. Didn’t even trade until after 100ish
---
[](/celestiawarfare)The shooting mechanics in FO76 aren't ***that*** bad. They're not as good as Blood, or even the original Quake, but some people still call Wolfenstein 3D a good shooter, and I'm willing to say 76 is a better shooter than that.  
---
I still don't want anything to do with PVP in it tho. Even if they give everyone the same loadout so it's even ground it's unlikely that it'll go down too well. Unless they make it halo 3 custom games crazy, but I doubt it.
---
Not any more than other camp decorations I would imagine.
---
Fashionable Glasses sort of match color-wise.
---
I have intense respect for you then. But it seems no matter how often I change servers, or at least relog, it doesnt change how tough the enemies are.
---
You jerking a male lol
---
Nope, it definitely feels worse for me now too. My favorite are the invisible enemies. I run a bloodied build so it’s like spawn, die, respawn, die, respawn until the game finishes doing its thing.
---
Just play rust you dweeb.
---
That is true I guess.
---
I guess times have really changed since launch, I just hopped on my old account and wow I wasn't being hunted down by people who thought they could outgun me
---
The best thing you can do is explore the crap out of the forest and parts of the savage divide and ash heap to level, do events, gain some XP for better level weapons, etc.  There’s SO much to find and do.  Do cap stash runs to build up your caps, farm things to sell them.  Stop at the main quest line that hits Abbie’s bunker and wait til you get better gear.  It’s meant to be explored that’s why the map is so big.  Also play around with CAMP building, find plans.  So much you can do.  You’ll meet people along the way!
---
Does everyone get their own drop if they tag the enemies? 
---
And does that drop open up to other people at any point in time? 
---
Genuinely do not know
---
Tried using the letters that were wrong: R C L I S I C in an anagram solver but it only could use 6 and spells relics, but that might mean nothing.
---
It depends on [where you are on the map](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/11/60ca88de-790x812.png), if you're level 23 you should be safe in the Forest, Toxic Valley, and the Ash Heap. You might want to grind up to a higher level before leaving if you're having trouble.  
---
I met a level 18 just today killing level 68's with a shotgun stealth build, so maybe you might want to have a look at your build as well.
---
I do explore often, do events, all that good stuff. But I'm just one guy haha.
---
No sweat!
---
The main story isn’t meant to be done fast and early. I suffered the same problems as you. I just went to different areas, explored. Did side quests, repeatables, events, base building. Don’t rush because once you hit 50, you’ll mainly just be running around a golf course.
---
It was rough going solo between 20 - 40 but it is fine now for me.
---
Load in is longer.  But once it loads in it is faster
---
Ive always playes Fallout for the fun of it, and the story I really like. It kinda sucks Bethesda makes the story kinda hard to further at a certain point
---
three* rabbits over the hill at the bunker service exit
---
Are there not certain outfits you can wear that do this. I.e. hazmat suit and garb of mysterys.(all i know of)
---
Would think there would be more like this for certain reasons like upgrades or special effects, can you mod it maybe?
---
Best answer I know to give you is sometimes, but not always. I've had camps before they spawned where I had first put the camp down, and other camps where would spawn no where near it. Really hoping they'll add fast travel mats soon.
---
If I set the frame up and put the pieces on it, it won’t let me claim it back to my inventory. It shows a message saying to remove the high level pieces first.
---
I've only been playing for about a week on PC, but I've moved CAMP several times so far. Plopped it down somewhere convenient at the time at first, then found a quaint spot in the mountains southeast of Summersville. Made a big house with a basement workshop and a great view. Well, as long as the lighting and textures loaded in properly anyway.
---
Now I'm on the road south of Summersville with a proper doctor's office/full service crafting emporium complete with free fresh water, fruits, and vegetables. I know when I finally get my hands on the brick or metal building sets I'll have to revamp the whole thing again, but that won't be too much of an issue.
---
Won’t allow it to be claimed back to my inventory.
---
I felt that way at first too. But then I stopped playing as a Fallout but rather as a new experience instead. Are you playing on Xbox? I could craft you some weapons/ammo/chems if that would help you.
---
Technically if you are trading real world money for in game items you are working for them-literally.
---
Thanks for the help  I found the whistle :D
---
Seen a sliding sheepsquach try fighting that lol .. but I did and won
---
Same here. I have no idea how to make this easier for people stopping by who happen to fast travel. Gonna just have to hope for the best, I guess.
---
Thanks for the reply. :)
---
You blocked or deleted you comment so fast I didn't even see it 😂😂 😂😂 😂
---
PC actually. And I dont have a problem fighting anything my level or 10 above, its just the ridiculous levels for a level 23 to fight
---
Fissures are terrible spots. Scorchbeasts &amp; scroched spawn there. Get high level turrets or move. Those are the best options.
---
Math.  Math is hard.
---
[](/angrytia)You don't build your camp in the cranberry bog and expect it to survive unless most of your camp budget is turrets. Even then, some turrets aren't stopping a Scorch beast before it does some damage. That has been my experience anyway.  
---
If you want to live in the bog I recommend retrofitting an existing structure, cave, house, whatever you can find. that way you don't have to worry about walls, and having an existing structure also frees up budget for more defenses.
---
Just a mixed message/bug, supposes to say stash is full
---
No worries glad to help.
---
No. My stash isnt full. Its my workshop limit.
---
I haven't been notified at all for ammo now that you mentioned this.   Don't think I have gotten and caps for ammo either.
---
What makes you think that it’ll be a battle royale?
---
I think it’s just bad luck. Most higher level players would tell you the same. Just as you’re tired of high levels, I’m constantly running into our “high end area “ completely full of level 9 ghouls.
---
Missile turrets take out most enemies for me.. but then again when i'm at my camp i can turn off my advertisements when i wanna explore.. of if i am too close to the max cap allotment and need to dump some
---
LOOOOOOOOOOOTS of bulk. Mainly lead and crystal people tend to buy, now my hoarding of materials can finely make people happy and not them greedy robot vendors.
---
Put a chair down when you land in foundation. The animation of sitting in the chair gets you out of it. Then just leave the chair there.
---
&gt;How would it work?
---
[](/celestfly)It won't.
---
Everyone seems to spawn in the same spot, what I did was have a friend travel to my camp and back a few times to see where they showed up and built from there. Think that's the best we can do at the moment.
---
Voice logs from a character in vault 51 have been datamined. Makes it very clear some kind of battle royale type mode is coming.
---
Wow. That's complete booty. C'mon BGS. I'm so sorry for your loss ): I hope you have a better day.
---
Well, plant some crops. Vending machines aren't high priortity target for the enemies.
---
I stated I hadn’t played in a while, asked a variety of questions and mentioned something I knew had been recently added.
---
When attacked and spoken to rudely I’ve responded congenially and tried to ameliorate your rudeness and anger instead of telling you that you’re a spiteful little cunt who should take his opinions and shove them up his ass.
---
You’re literally being confrontational and abusive over a post in a subreddit, are you ok?
---
If a player damages a ghoul, they tag it which causes that player to be able to loot that ghoul. If they don’t tag it, they don’t get any rewards, basically giving only the killer the opportunity of good loot, which isn’t kind. The drop does not open to others over time.
---
I found that when I moved mine inside the actual house it helps people not spawn in the walls or foundation, but the spawn point likely seems to always be where I originally placed it.  Depends on good days or bad days :)
---
I dealt with this issue recently. I had a friend fast travel to my camp after I placed the CAMP tool and made a note if it was acceptable spot. If I didnt like where he fast traveled in at, I moved the camp a little and tried again. After I liked the spot, I put a foundation down close to the ground and made that the welcome to my base entrance. Worked well.
---
Can you link me?
---
Wait, really? Thank you you fucking angel!
---
I have an orbital strike beacon that begs to differ....
---
There are better solutions than that. They could make it so the machines remember what were in them before they were destroyed. I’m fine with having to rebuild camp items. I’m not fine with having to reprice 60 items
---
I don't get this at all. Does he think having those cards somehow means I can't PvP? Because they don't effect my damage perks whatsoever by just using rifles and automatics.
---
I wanted this from the beginning as well. I thought that it would be cool to create custom factions and declare values, war and territory. However since the game already needs work done on it I am doubtful that this will be added anytime soon.
---
Ok let me point one thing out. Look at your downvote ratio.  The community, in general, is sick to _death_ of posts like yours. Yours was the ...third? I've replied to in the last 24 hours. 
---
Seriously, yeah, I was impolite. Because posts like yours _need to fucking stop_.
---
I don’t know that’s what makes this so silly and I can’t stop chuckling about it 😂
---
Solo player here. Just ask some one like I did. Take a glance at the swim merit badge also.
---
HE DID THE SAME TO ME 🤣🤣🤣🤣 FOOD BUILDS UNITE
---
Thats so weird is the camp maxed out. 
---
I did have this issue once tho, I was in the middle of moving my camp when i noticed but once i did, it fixed iit when i changed locations. Hasnt happend since.
---
I can’t fast travel to mine. I end up in the middle of a tree with “You can’t go that way.”
---
But like... what... what does he mean I’m so confused!
---
Ya basic.
---
I actually couldn't get it to work on that one. Though i've since read you have to do it at a specific angle. Either way, i got mine by literally jumping off a cliff and wacking into the front of one of the nuke code guarding ones, to get close enough to get it to count &gt;&lt;
---
Just like real life, if people are shitting on your lawn and breaking into your house..its time to move.
---
PC Xbox PS4?
---
Than we can buy the battle pass, and get caps and cosmetic rewards. I will try it, but i dont feel like this is necessary for this game
---
So you speak for the entire community and feel entitled enough to silence me?
---
Should I stop making any reddit posts or communicating online without ur approval ?
---
Seriously dude, get over yourself, how entitled are you?
---
As I said, if u don’t like it, don’t read it, you don’t own the FO76 subreddit, let me be me and you go be you.
---
No one is forcing you to read or reply to anything, if you’re getting this upset then uhhh maybe you shouldn’t ? You’re making this subreddit a more hostile and unfriendly place.
---
Upvotes: some of my comments have more upvotes than yours.
---
Heres a video I made. Pay attention to my stash weight, and vending capacity. Neither is maxed out. Only when I max out the workshop limit does it keep me from adding items https://youtu.be/ADn3mziZ2h4

This is one of the reasons I love my mutations.

Thats so odd of all the bugs to.

But thanks for getting the word out.

I've done 2 characters up to level 130 with no-one else the only time I've done it is the new scouts quest where you need to Revive a player.
---
It is doable you just need to stay out of certain areas to your ready
---
Why do we "owe" you friendliness? 
---
I don't need to "justify" my frustration at people like you.  Posts like this do _nothing_ for the community as a whole. 
---
This isn't the start of a conversation. This is you trying to not do your own research.
---
While i was fighting the SBQ today my game began to freeze frame so badly it was unplayable. I had to leave and come back for it to get fixed

How about we chill until they actually release it. How about that?

God i swear this is the most easily triggered fanbase on this planet.

Yes, but how do you kill them reliably before BEING killed?

Dude what the fuck are you on about are u saying that people who don't pvp shouldn't be playing or what? I don't get it

Everyone's chilly chill chill, Stop being triggered by triggering.

I’ve stated over and over again IM TRYING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DISCUSS THE RECENT UPDATES TO THE GAME.
---
How do you not get this ?
---
Again who are you to say what my intentions are ?
---
I’m certainly not starting this post to accrue a mass of upvotes.
---
Posts like this are returning players asking what’s good so they know what they’re returning for, how is more players a bad thing for the community ?
---
Friendliness ?
---
You’re not even being basically civil? I dunno if you understand how the world works but being civil is pretty much the baseline for being a decent person, being friendly loses you nothing and sometimes gains you friends.

Being rude and confrontational just makes you look like a dickhead.

I made a food build what do you think? https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=95c5555&amp;d=sa0sb0p70p10e80e10e70e40e90e60ek0el0e20ef0c30s70lm0lf0l50lb0l00&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=3a

/u/valseek
---
can you shed some light on what's happening here?
---
Money is worth nothing in this game, and if you played regularly and have some mules you already sit on many stacks of 25K caps.
---
Most certainly this player is hoarding 2\* or 3\* items to trade them for crips in prevision of the future legendary vendor, that is what I do with my money anytime I see any legendary item for sell at acceptable price.
---
there is a crossbow in the middle cabin in middle mountain cabins (just east of whitesprings), if you stand on the steps of one of the cabins you can shoot the 3 enemies that spawn there (3 x yao guai, 3 honey beasts or 3 radscorpions)

FOOD BUILD THE NEW META https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=95c5555&amp;d=sa0sb0p70p10e80e10e70e40e90e60ek0el0e20ef0c30s70lm0lf0l50lb0l00&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=3a&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app

I figured but its speculation lol
---
There were a few ghouls attacking suga bombs the moo-moo while doing free range but I killed them before they could kill her, but she died to my explosive effect somehow? Seems like a bug that I couldn’t help but I felt bad and that’s why I posted this
---
Ok buddy. 
---
You should still do your own fucking research. My being a dick about seeing way to many people who refuse to do their own fucking homework doesn't detract from your entitled attitude being annoying as fuck.
---
I don’t know but I can’t stop laughing about it.  It’s just too much.
---
&gt;power stations
---
Sorry could you elaborate on the power stations. You mean the one that produces one core every 75 min or do you mean you loot certain places? Thanks
---
He is talking about the casuals that use 90% utility cards... and crying that the Queen is glitched when she does not take dmg with awesome 110dmg medic hunting rifles. I dont care about pvp buts its annoying in queen fights with ppl that dont do any dmg to her barely. Im totally cool with ppl playing who they want. 
---
But not cool with ppl running to Queen fight with 90% utility perk cards and taking 20 shots to drop a regular enemy
---
Yes I want laugh as well. I just do the vomit one and hope they understand.
---
I had missile turrets on my camp for less than a day as they used too much space and we're not much use. You can honestly camp most places except Cranberry Bog without any defence
---
[](/celestiafrown)Hell if I know, those voice lines certainly sound like some new pvp mode, and that's enough to kill my enthusiasm.
---
You mean CLOUT GOGGLES!?
---
We aren’t messing up your game. The game just isn’t what you want it to be and you’re sad you can’t manipulate it to be. 
---
Post history shows you have no knowledge of the game (he just last month was asking what power armor is) and shows you buying assassins sentinel on the marketplace. You joined super recently and decided to be a PvP guy and now you’re mad he game didn’t go according to plan.      Sucks to suck.
---
My friend wears em everywhere in-game and I refuse to call them clout goggles now. It's better with the veil of secrets, cuz it looks like a shitty loincloth.
---
You’re projecting shared frustrations about queen fights and not talking about the specific build he refers to as food.  I will beat this horse until it’s dead and alive again.  It makes zero sense.  🤡
---
Revive an Ally? For the Pioneer Scouts quest?  
---
I just found a low-level player (Under lvl10) on the map and followed him/her (stealthily of course) until they died, ran in to revive, done!  
---
I almost exclusively play Solo, and Revive an Ally was probably one of the easiest challenges to get.
---
Bf has fallen so far from what it was i want nothing to do with it. Its a completely different game. I hope that nuclear winter explands on the unique mechanics and lore instead of yet another game falling into mediocrity to satiate investors short term profits.
---
I would get rid of Cannibal. Can't have you eating on the go, it's all about carrying as much food and drink on you as possible so when you get killed you drop it and... piss people off...?
---
All of your vitriol is based on the assumption that I haven’t looked at any of the patch notes or update info, I have in fact looked at some, as I’ve said - I’m trying to have a conversation with others that want to do so.
---
So I don’t “refuse to do my own home work”
---
You say I’m entitled, yet you’re telling me I should be a certain way and aren’t allowed to do certain things that upset you and that I must adhere to some magical set of rules that you have for the world and Reddit.
---
Perhaps you should take a good look at yourself, buddy.
---
There was some early advice not to revive players who are connected to pylons when downed as its 30 second where the pylon is still seen as active and the downed player takes no further damage.
---
I tend to stimpack everyone though which means I often go through 50 odd stims per event
---
Rawr!  Im a Food Build!  You can actually HEAR me getting fatter!
---
Escape artistan don't work whole time, so.....
---
He is calling builds that use mostly utility and no dmg perk cards food builds
---
Dont like it dont play it tbh
---
Oh man, I just figured that after I died 8 times and dropped all my food I would need a backup plan cause like what would I do if I didn’t have food.
---
I agree. The game should have more of a balance for both sides. I have a toon for farming an another for the static. I think if the newest update don't contain too you (players in general) then don't worry. Whitesprings will still be there when next you log back in. If some people just chill and not data mine they could enjoy the game day by day, instead of stressing about a possible update. All while wanting changes or nerfs before and update is even released.
---
Oh yeah, laugh at the food builds all you want. But when the hot dog eating contest at Camden Park starts, we'll see who's laughing *then*.
---
Ign Clancyy there is one in my vending machine for 100caps
---
Nope. Your sales, your prices, if they don't like your prices, they can shop elsewhere, the msg is just them being childish.
---
I have only \~50 drops since P9 but I haven't played that much. I wouldn't say there is an [abundance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtrJVYcwz60aokD5QenY6lhMpHgiIyYQQGq_XgKtJz0/edit#gid=2122967287) of legendaries in Whitesprings, 0-9 non-nuked and \~12 nuked for me (need to clear up the meat piles because otherwise they don't respawn). I did get a 3\* Weightless Combat Armor Chest (+INT, +blocking) which I modded to BoS and Ultra light and replaced my previous 1\* Weightless Leather. If I consider the Scrip, it wasn't that bad as I maxed out on the daily scraps.
---
Just got a TSE Gauss for 7k and I'm loving it
---
Okay but call it utility build I can’t with the food build 🤣
---
It's not.
---
I think there's some in Flatwoods.
---
I wonder if they'll change that. Really no reason they should be
---
Ticks
---
only way it would work is if there where 0 legendary gear, EVERYONE had the same perks, and all players started off with a crummy melee weapon. VATS would have to be disabled. and it would be too much work. id stay in adventure mode
---
Can I upvote this 700 times.
---
The cap win in survival doesn't matter to me, there's better ways to earn money. I just enjoy killing other players.
---
Agree totally....I switch to my crossbow and tag and move on....
---
It's sooooo frustrating when a crew of dudes in PA and supersledges rock up at the golf club and just clean it out.
---
Having said that, a couple of times we've had a dude in PA stand in front of the window and tank the ghouls, wait a reasonable time for us to tag em, then cleans that space before going downstairs to kite them back up.
---
Thanks to all those considerate players xxx
---
I agree, I'm not at my PC now but I should hopefully get that done today and let you know
---
if you start with a Fresh new character, I'm all for it. If you play as your main, it will be broken and I want None of it.
---
Mob spawns aren't possible for Mappalachia yet, but maybe a next version
---
Yup. I have like 30 on me.
---
It’s those glasses that Kurt cobaine wore. I think Denzel curry coined “clout goggles” I’ve called them that ever since I heard it just because I think it’s kind of a funny name. But really they’re Kurt cobaine shades.
---
Think they used to spawn in Helvetica as well, just near where you fast travel in
---
From voice logs you can get, this mode will have pickable weapons across it. so dont worry.
---
I hope those radiation zones or wtf was in logs are some PvE boss mechanic. That would be great!
---
ok thanks i will check it out
---
Can we legit PLEASE comment on this a lot so it’ll be in the rising so everyone can see the food build I created cause all I want is for everyone to now have them.  I’m starting a new character tomorrow with that build.
---
They likely will but it seems to be a glaring oversight with this update.
---
Intresting idk where to start though,  have you tried rearranging the words
---
You're not the only one; they're too high-res for most "mobile views" look for an option such as "request desktop site" in your browser/client. Alternatively, use the Imgur app or ofc an actual pc
---
And yea I wear the clean spacesuit and the clout goggles. Looks dope, they would look cool with the white wolf fedora as well
---
thanks, i haven't been there since the parade so it's good reason to go back
---
[](/ce10)Well sure, it's not like I have to play it. It's just that dev time is going to it when there's a massive void of end game content for the main game. Not only that, but if they want to spend the time working on PvP I've certainly heard that Survival is in desperate need of help as it is.  
---
Seems ill advised from any angle I approach it from.
---
Yeah, I call em clout goggles, it's just my friend mentions them WAY too much, so in his presence I protest the term. Just a weird thing I do to spite him a little.
---
Yea I could see the name being really annoying if you are hearing it constantly.
---
You're a food build now. Backup plans are for *real* players.
---
I was level 200 with 4/5sentinel armor, when i was killed by two shots from lvl8 pump shotgun.
---
Game is balanced well.
---
Mothman lighthouse, second floor of small house, always locked lvl 0
---
Just server hop 3 times and u done
---
Yeah I have to agree, I'm not completely ruling out them producing a mode that is absolutely brilliant. It's just I don't really like battle royale games at all as there's not much sense of progression, I like to find weapons, armor etc and actually keep it.
---
You can see a cow icon at southeastern of Vault 76 on map. There is an encounter area with chance of chicken spawn.
---
Agreed.  
---
Considering where you spawn, especially when fast-travelling to a player vending, like you, I repeatably appear under or inside their CAMP as it's spawning, a functional mat would make sense as it would prevent this situation, and you could have a little spawn area to put it in, maybe with an "arrivals" sign!  
---
Thing is we already have the Welcome Mat (well I do), it just doesn't work as it should.
---
I haven’t been online but will be later today, in around 8 hours, IGN:spiff_swe add me if you still need help and we will figure it out.
---
That’s why you always have to remember to store your scraps. If I see a paper bag I’m going to take everything i need and store it. Junk is something every player needs so there’s no getting around that. Except by storing your stuff before you go anywhere.
---
okey thanks i will check
---
Lol lucky u that u do not use shotguns, it could be a big surprise for u
---
Yeah, maybe a secret sublevel or something similar.
---
I'm convinced it's  a BR simply because they didn't advertise any new content for the upcoming chapter of the game.
---
Never heard of  food builds either 😂
---
This happens to me occasionally, I have to leave the game and re-enter to fix it.
---
Just let it return to your inventory after 2 minutes. The timeout return ignores high level pieces
---
There seems to be places that are random critter spawns, sometimes you will get a rabbit, sometimes a squirrel, sometimes a chicken and sometimes a Fox, this happens in the field opposite Charleston station (you’ll need to tap vats to spot them) and just to the left of Ohio River adventures, I’ve seen posts that say over the road from the overseers camp has a spawn for critters too. Can’t say I know of a guaranteed chicken spawn.
---
Pretty sure if you read the rest of his comment it answers your question. The ones that 'generate' suggests the power plants and the fact that there's 3 of them.
---
Everything now has a base dmg resistance of 1.
---
Also, I’m pretty sure everything got it’s dr increased by 1 as well.
---
Please follow my guideline above to become a Food Build and join THE FOOD GUILD.
---
😂😂😂
---
using the developer console is not the same thing as exploiting. exploiting is specifically abusing a broken mechanic in an unintended way for advantage. the developer console was literally added to allow cheating (to test, to debug, etc) - it is the very opposite of an exploit.
---
a better example of an exploit would be to find a way to exploit a perk bug or similar to achieve in-game damage that is not possible of getting. this is starkly different from spawning in materials to build a settlement - in the first scenario you are fundamentally changing the challenge of the game in a completely unintended way, while in the other scenario you are using tools given by the developers to skip/fast forward past boring segments of the game (i.e. fast traveling to locations that you normally cannot, spawning in materials or weapons, setting your level to 80, etc).
---
i had a character at 70\~ in fallout 4 and decided to restart. i used the console to set my character up to 70.
---
i mean, i guess you could argue the console allows for fundamentally broken functions too (like god mode), but it still technically isn't an exploit.
---
Can anyone help me?
---
Can confirm this, i remember looting it first beta day from corpse locked fridge in flatwoods, i died super fast in it, because i was "naked" when i put that trash on.
---
This has happened to me with the stash itself (no store). Once I closed out of the game and went back the weight was corrected.
---
Yes it will. It will automatically happen after a certain period of time.
---
I personally don't think they're going to release a classic BR mode. Fallout just doesn't have the shooting mechanic polish to manage that.  Not to mention the size of the map just isn't conducive to a classic BR game. Too big. Too long to to traverse for a classic BR style game.
---
I definitely think it's going to be a PvE situation. 
---
I'd hope they'd have a distinct variant planned. Something more drawn out,  a very survival driven BR.
---
Fuck yeah im in 👍 already have 1650 something dog food
---
PvP isn’t even broken because of those weapons. I had someone contest my camp and they were at really low hp running bloodied explosive... which im not worried about. I’m just worried about the fact that I have maxed out strength and melee perks yet two hits from my axe did NO damage, apparently it’s because of damage scaling based on level. The higher your level the lower your damage to other players or something. PvP is completely broken as a mechanic imo.
---

---
Take the workshop, it has a Fusion core maker, you just need to power it then wait. Defending may be necessary if people try to steall them.
---
Yeah my boyfriend and i used rads &amp; a couple grenades on ourselves so we could revive each other, then a random guy approached us and asked if he could revive one of us. My bf happily obliged, &amp; the guy said thank you &amp; carried on. Doesn't hurt to ask!
---
P E P P E R O N I   R O L L S
---
**Bug?** Picking up a Frog results in 2 Frogs in the inventory, possibly due to Green Thumb?
---
**Bug.** Killed a 3\* Glowing One in a Whitesprings Nuke zone and it did not have any legendary loot, just junk items. A subsequent Diseased (Legendary) Glowing One had a legendary 1\* item. I waited 5 minutes, looked around for a world spawn of the item, nothing. It happened on the veranda of one of the houses with the hand scanner. No other players were within 100 meters and the server was otherwise responsive.
---
**Bug.** *Not new.* Killed enemies fall through the stairs leading up to the veranda in front of the Whitesprings houses (with the hand scanners) and end up inaccessible for looting. Explosives do not seem to push them out.
---
**Bug.** *Not new and have not verified this with P9 yet.* When defending the huge excavator, mobs often have difficulty scaling the western and southern metal steps and simply fall through to the ground. They try it several times until they can get up.
---
**Bug?** *Not new.* Quad Crossbows reload one arrow per pressing reload (comes up lately due to the Tadpole challenges).
---
Go to world challanges near the bottom the badges need multipart sub quests doing, as for revive I also need this o e, you on PC?
---
Aw man he deleted it or mods did now no one else will know the greatness.
---
&gt;Except every other game manages to do this and it's only Bethesda games that introduce a new duping glitch with every patch.
---
i can read just fine. it seems you have only played fallout 76, because you think it is the only game strife with duplication issues.
---
on top of my head, games with a lot of duping; Grimdawn, Borderlands 1 and 2, Diablo 2 (whoops a blizzard title to boot!), Titan Quest, RuneScape, EverQuest 2, Star Wars Galaxies, Forza 2, Gran Turismo 5, Phantasy Star Online, FortNite... etc.
---
duplication glitches are oddly common. they exist in all games (in particular old games) but online games are quick to patch it. you do usually not hear of new duplication methods in other games because most glitches of that kind are not shared or found by the general population.
---
world of warcraft has also had plenty of duping problems. they always shut down their servers and rollback them, making sure the glitch is entirely gone before restarting the servers. they still introduce new glitches. but they are very good at fixing it - and quickly.
---
so, you probably haven't played many games, or you just simply have not been aware of the copious amount of duping in pretty much every game. sorry, it's just a really common problem.
---
But haven't they nerved it to a core for every 75 min?
---
PS4:(
---
Very good work it's much appreciated 👍🏻
---
No. Not going to happen, it's my CAMP, it's called personal space, if you can't respect that then my traps and turrets will have to say "Bye Bye!" IF you decide to break in that is.  
---
Note: I might put a vending machine on a separate foundation nearby, outside of my primary CAMP building, might, possibly, IF I can be bothered.
---
No worries then mate, good luck on the quests and revive :)
---
Data mining shows it most likely will be a couple different pvp events relating to vault 51. I don't have much interest in it since pvp is a crapshoot as it is. With all the performance issues, clipping, and damage bugs how can we take competitive pvp seriously?
---
I got a counter on that 10% Bethesda try getting 10% on 1000 .45 amo if i sell it for 0 caps😌
---
What is a food build 😂😂
---
I just started roaming around event zones to trigger currently-inactive events (cause an event won't start until someone gets near its area, i believe). Happened to be doing Path to Enlightenment and a couple of scouts joined up with me so we could all knock off that part of our Entomologist badges. After the event was over I just asked one of them to jump off the lighthouse so I could give 'em a revive.
---
Thank you, you too
---
I've also had that happen, which wasn't a problem a few months ago. I've seen other folks reporting it as well. It's really obnoxious when you're completely paralyzed and vulnerable in one of the most dangerous situations in the entire game.
---
From the evidence I’ve come across so far, it seems that the BR Mode is going to be a combination of 4 v 4 v 4 team deathmatch on the surface and free for all inside the Vault. But I would like to be completely wrong because if there’s progress locked behind victories, that’s going to be a lot of upset players.
---
Maybe a horde mode in a way and the Vault AI doesn’t recognise they aren’t human?
---
I have become that guy. I got tired of not getting a chance to tag the enemies so I use a TSE 50 to just one shot em now. I'm in the market for a ghoul slayer Tesla rifle so I can crank it up a notch.
---
Go to the search bar.  Type in food build.  You will see.
---
" And it has just about every amenity for ya "  
---
But does it have Netflix? Asking for a friend.
---
[](/buzzlestia)This is a very specific, and likely very short lived, reference, and I love that you've made it.
---
He just wants it for 1 or 2 cap, that cheap bastard. Ignore him.
---
Follow the river from Flatwoods towards death claw island and where the riverbed forks and is dried out is where I found mine for the challenge
---
Yes that's true.  But that kind of better fix won't come soon.
---
more like 10-15
---
I grab em and sell at my camp
---
80-90 armor. Boxing glove. Nuff said.
---
I've got one up on ps4.
---
I think that the 75min timer was a bug, only lasted for a patch
---
All done, thanks panmand
---
I'm assuming you mean in Survival? PvP should not exist in Adventure Mode, well other than Bounties that is. You do the crime, you pay the fine, or die, either works well for me.
---
They work nice with the pressure plate. You can rig it so they open when you stand on the plate.
---
I imagine it as part of survival or a new mode entirely.
---
They patched out team hunting him. He falls over dead when someone else loads in.
---
That's fantastic, had no idea there were people doing this.
---
Probably a stupid question, but how are you all messaging each other? Is this in game?
---
Well there's already a taunt emote for them to use..
---
New Pizza Oven - 2000 atoms!
---
What level are you?
---
Yep, I haven't been able to use half walls at all since the update (leaving my shed backless, since I stupidly thought "We've made it easier to clip things through terrain" meant, y'know, what it said instead of "Nothing's changed and also half walls don't work anymore). Not the end of the world, but annoying.
---
I'll take the miniguns off your hands no prob.
---
I like maybe! Keep up the amazing work! Knowledge **is** Power
---
that is so unnecessary
---
Do not sell items/ammo for 1 cap each, for some reason the tax rounds down on the amount and you rarely get the caps you should.
---
This is the kind of stuff I love to see. Bit of a mystery to hype up the next content release, kinda like when the Transmission event hit Destiny 1 just prior to the Rise of Iron release. Weird stuff happening outta nowhere, just hinting at something larger happening down the road.
---
136, never had any super mutant attack me like this before (with poison damage)
---
No kidding. They keep reverting things like scrapping mods but this one sticks.
---
it doesn't actually matter what the price of the item is, i've found. i'm always getting around 1/3rd of what i should be getting. 1 cap items, 25 cap items, always around 1/3rd less.
---
99.999999% chance it’s duped. There was one person spotted wearing one on day 2 or 3 of the event and due to the impossibly rare drop rates (which we all complained about) and because 1 was only ever seen on P.C it was concluded at the time that it was most likely stolen from the Dev room. Despite requests no-one could actually show proof with ingame video or images of any of the rare masks dropping. Added to this is the fact that we had maintenance to fix an “exploit” on Friday so there may be a variety of ill gotten duped items in the world now and this mask is probably one of them.
---
Same here, my aid items crept up on me til I was constantly running at my max carry weight. Now I've got a bit of wiggle room again, and ever since the vendor caps are all connected I might finally get that carry weight down for good.
---
This is messed up..... absolutely terrible. Not sure if this has happened to me or not but ignorance is bliss I guess.
---
Craft them, do the event Uranium Fever when you see it. It guarantees you 3 legendaries every time whether you fail or succeed. Farm nuke zones if you’re really that determined. Personally I just waited until I hit 50 then started looking.
---
Another thing, it could also be your build. You don’t want to be using rifle perks if your using a melee weapon, or 1 handed melee perks if you’re using a 2 handed.
---
guess i gotta put another 6 hours into server hopping. It wouldn't even be that bad if he just had all is possible loot pool all the time. Not literally 1 or 2 items at a time
---
Yeah. Although I can't see a Battle Royale mode ever working, too many players, it will just crash the servers, as they do currently with current player caps.
---
Ash heep, between the cemetery and the town
---
Would be pretty nice if we could get another perk or something that let us craft standalone mods for items. Maybe for increased cost in materials? It's sketchy enough having to hand over your gear to a perfect stranger, let alone the potential for connection issues mucking things up even further. Being able to craft somebody a mod they could just drop into their gear on their own would be pretty cool.
---
I have some good low level legendary weapons if your on Xbox one
---
Battle Royale in 76 would be a joke. I sincerely hope they're getting better at hiding things and it's just a ruse. This would be a terrible direction to go and way, way too late. Other games that just follow industry trends like this have bombed, sometimes hard. Looking at you Culling 2. Given how laggy and how many issues this still has... Just please let this not be a thing. Please. The game's been steadily improving and this is a step in the wrong direction.
---
More PvP modes *would* be a good thing. There should absolutely be locations to go and the ability to do fun modes without needing timed events.
---
Not a rehashed concept past its prime on an outdated engine.
---
You made a post yesterday asking if duping even still exists and now you are an expert on it?
---
No maintenance on the 16th when the Purveyor drops? 
---
On Xbox sadly.
---
yeah they are, and extremely rare at that. They're considered legacy weapons and don't drop anymore.
---
And yes, the effect stacks. Your gun will degrade 5x faster. Two Shot only adds one more laser to the spread, thank god it doesnt double all the lasers for a total of 8. 8x the lasers and 8x the degrade.
---
yeah. i don't know. i know other people have said 1 cap items have issues, but no one seems to know, or talk about, or even have, the issue i'm having where it doesn't matter how much the item is. 
---
for something like ammo, at 1 cap each, yeah it sucks not getting what i should be, but it's just ammo.
---
but the more expensive stuff? that hurts, because the more expensive stuff is usually harder to get things. i just added several quantum x01 paint plans to my machines, if someone buys them and i get shafted again?
---
that'll hurt.
---
oh, thats very interesting, ill try it out with a few mates later and see what happens, thanks!
---
If they get Display cases to work, then there's hope.
---
Took me about 7 hours to get mine. He had it the fourteenth time I found him. I did get the spacesuit and longshoreman outfit too. To be honest I wouldn't do it again. You can buy them on the market for around 3k caps and I see too many people wearing it anymore.
---
Now I have seen the method for myself. Why the hostility?
---
Dudes angry cuz he watched this stream last night on you tube. Some PVP’ers with thousands of hours in game angry at the nerds to their sent ass armour and explosive shotys , which imo is very annoying and I can understand the annoyance as I run the same gear but the blame needs to go to Bethesda not people who play the game differently to you.

Depends on your build.. if like me you’re a semi auto rifle build, mainly sneak attacks, then a level 35 lever action will be very strong. Get one with instigating and you’ll be OP against most enemies.
---
The stage is outdoors.  
---
The instruments in the Nukashine also don't work.  It seems most of the Musician quest elements are bugged.
---
It does look like 8 explosions to me lol I'll have to double check later.
---
My old one was on the monorail which I've had for several months, only since trying to relocate to the Mire a couple days ago has this problem occured for me.
---
I struggled with getting the photograph a Yao Guai, if you don't get the target name coming up on the screen from the camera (top-right of the screen I believe), separate to that of the pip-boy, it won't count, wasted a bunch of film until I realised this.
---
I'll upload a vid of it happening later when I get off work
---
I used the console as an example because it isn't exploiting, it's directly cheating. If exploiting bugs and bad design is bad because it's cheating then actual cheating is bad, but I don't think either is bad. 
---
A better example of exploiting that I've done for fun then would be the smithing/enchanting exploit in Skyrim. I spent 30 minutes powering up and became a GOD. It was fun.
---
Broken mechanics are the fault of the devs. People using them aren't making the game unfun for themselves, and it shouldn't be up to players to police ourselves. If the devs want to then they can fix a duping exploit, if they want to sell an item on their store instead then they will. 
---
Ban cheaters, sure. But do QA so it's not easy to actually exploit the game like that in a multiplayer online game.
---
There's a rare bug where an enemy has the appearance of one type and the AI of another type (say, a Mole Miner that thinks it's a Mr Gutsy). It could be that you got a Super Mutant that thinks it's a Mirelurk Queen.
---
Thanks ! For now i was to scared. I don't know why. I think if i want to farm nuke zones i heave to change my power armor from T-51b to T-45 because it has better rad resistance.
---
crafting and placing the frog habitat does not check the criteria off the herpetoligist challenge, I've seen other people complaining of this too
---
Definitely Whitesprings. Got 2 of ghouls I killed and I found 1 in a toolbox round the back of the building that’s behind the fountain that removes diseases.
---
Yes to the turrets on the roof thing... gives them more range and enemies can't just run up and destroy.
---
Yoo that camp is wicked mate, proper looks like the monorail is supporting the structure. Plus being up high like that I doubt you get harassed by the wildlife much.
---
No, i play on pc.
---
Damn if it is then lucky/unlucky you. The last I seen and tested of it was 5 but please inform me otherwise (hopefully with a sma video clip too?)
---
“will not disclose process”, ya cause you don’t know it.
---
I seem to be doing well with BOS Underarmour, the Knight, Officer and Soldier. Also the marine wetsuit. I’ve also been selling duplicate alcohol recipes which surprised me because I thought everyone would have them from Biv by now but apparently not. Magazines have done well and I’m glad cause they weigh too much and I always forget which ones I have so I never benefit from their buffs so they might as well be used by those that do use them and finally mutation serums, haven’t really tried selling weapons or armour
---
ive actually never seen someone with in person, and im kinda short on caps at the moment, i have just enough to buy it from this merchant himself lol
---
What idiots avoid using whole cities of perfectly good, pre-existing structures; exclusively building weaker structures from scratch just outside city limits instead :P ?
---
Not going to be baited into telling you, sorry.
---
Oh damn
---
i'm haven't said anything about that.
---
but, it's different in an online game, because your cheating/exploiting directly effects other players. for example, the duping glitch crashes the servers and bring about a lot of instability, which is directly lessening my fun of the game to have your own very niche kind of fun (that frankly has a much shorter lifetime of fun than normal gameplay).
---
cheat and exploit all you want in singleplayer games, and blame developers if you must, but the fact remains that anyone duping things in fallout 76 is doing everyone else a huge disservice.
---
I use melee and guns. I find handy to heave a rifle. What if an enemy is in a place you can't reach.
---
Upvoted because I like you!
---
I personally don't much worry about it if someone's around while I'm browsing their wares, but even if I didn't really need anything they were selling I'll usually buy something if their camp looks neat. Found one that was built at one of those little concrete bridges in the Mire (the types that pass over streams and such). The owner's home was nestled under the road right on top of the water, while the actual vending machine was set up in a fortified checkpoint topside. I loved the idea, so I bought a few hundred rounds of .308 from the vendor even though I already had oodles of the stuff anyway.
---
If I ever do set up my own vending machine and put legendaries in it, I'll probably just sit nearby on a guitar or in a bed so potential customers can inspect the gear without me just standing over their shoulder like a goon.
---
Exactly...
---
I dont have turrets in my camp saves a lot of space.maybe you have a lot of defences up?  I trashed all my legendary equipment asap when the vending thing popped at the train stations. I only sold my 2shots and my old tse equipment in my vending machines. Just let a lot of it go. And if your on ps4 ill gladly buy one of those gauss rifles.
---
Another location is just behind the Clancy Manor, northeast from Vault 76 ;)  
---
 [Right Here ;)](https://i.imgur.com/8nQ87om.jpg)
---
I’ve equipped the perk card for hearing their locations in a desperate attempt to find more lol
---
[](/awelestia)Lightweight clubs are great at getting the highest club speed, but it's really hard to get a feel for them. I've also heard they're fantastic for elderly golfers since they reduce joint strain.  
---
In the post Apocalypse tho, it's less of a tactical advantage I'd say.
---
I remember reading about a bug with the Miner Miracles quest that said if you have the Excavator equipped, you won't get the plans from the terminal. Hopefully your good intentions doesn't screw him later.
---
Sell all the chems you find and don't use, sell in bulk whatever material you dont use (for me it's usually Glass and Gears), instead of scrapping weapons you know you already have all the mods known for just sell them instead. 
---
Always have atleast 3 Charisma to have max Hard Bargain perk on when trading, every small amount makes a difference.
---
If you have a ton of ammo you don't use, then sell it to other players. Set up a shop in your camp and sell ammo at a cap a piece.
---
I don’t mind the floating liberators, I find them very entertaining, but the other problems shouldn’t be a thing anymore. It’s such a huge game, it must be so difficult to fix the hundreds of different bugs..... and then more pop up.
---
My house and shop are filled with the cats lol. 
---
Now to wait for that plague doctor mask.
---
I noticed it says CAMP is full on every container being full now, whether it's your stash, or even random containers in the world.
---
Btw i play solo.
---
I feel like this has been taken away and now every vendor shares a cap limit. I’ve gone to Whitesprings, Enclave Bunker, and R&amp;G Railroad so far... gonna go to other side of map and try....
---
Thanks but kreeeeeeeg and I got it done... Jumped off the pipe in Grafton steel into shallow water killing self while team mate waited in water with stim. Took about 2 minutes once we figured out what we were doing.
---
The travel agent perk will help you save a load of money in. The long run on fast travelling :)
---
thanks i will check it out
---
Yeah I will test it later, not home till 6pm UK
---
They place very easily. I put them everywhere.
---
Also grape mentats help when selling stuff
---
I've only had my camera for a day or two now, and I've already found three or four extras in toolboxes all over the wasteland. Not in any particular area - one in the Vault-Tec Agricultural Center, one at some place in the middle of the Mire, one at the Morgantown Airport, I think. Point is, keep your eyes on those toolboxes. You're bound to find a replacement soon enough.
---
I think people are taking things a bit far, though I'm not sure if you're serious or not. This ain't The Sims, this is Fallout! You'll choke down a couple mouthfuls of charbroiled radrat meat with a manky old tato and by god you'll be grateful!
---
Thanks, i will get in the next time
---
[](/ce08)Go to charleston station, walk across the red bridge that the tracks go down, turn to your left and jump into the gutter, kill the level 10 grafton monster, harvest 16-26caps from his corpse, quit to main menu, join a new server, do it again.  
---
That's how I made my cash for the longest time. Then you can sell the guns he drops to the bot at Charleston station, and the Acid, and Oil the monster drops to players.
---
thanks
---
There is a UI bug where the amount shown on the sale is the amount in the buyers inventory, not the amount you sold. Check if they actually bought that amount from you.
---
I use a quad tesla just for tagging
---
1st : Normaly I do that but my stash is a bit stuffed atm  
---
2nd : I was mostly talking about the stuff i gathered during the Event. Like, all the precious hardend masses. Cant realy bugger off in the middle of an Epic fight  to drop of my shit at base :p
---
Thank you, i will try it
---
Always dreamt  of a food build.  Never could figure the perks out.  I'll have to try this out.  I lined the extra strength for all the mut fruit we like to carry.  Well done.
---
I call BS and just because I use the market sub to trade items means I dupe? I’m sure dupers wouldn’t waste their time with a lvl 35 2* ve handmade(which is for sale ,XB1)
---
Upvoted for visibility. This is seriously broken.
---
Disconnect for me has been so bad that I'm taking some time off. Been playing Days Gone, fun times.
---
Yeah, because the servers have always been so wonderfully stable when people weren't duping and cheating, especially under normal gameplay circumstance. /s
---
Again, server stability is on Bethesda, banning cheaters is on Bethesda, and QA to prevent cheating in the first place is on Bethesda. Why are servers crashing when players dupe items? Are people not meant to have items?
---
Plenty of online games don't have this shit, or they fix it.
---
It could have a capture the flag element to it if your factions aim is to take over enemy bases.
---
I used to like the old animations from new Vegas I think, where you wouldkick  and stomp on bugs when on vats.
---
Stupid question: is there a reason to do them if you not interested into getting all achievements/ in getting atoms? 
---
Do they grant those possum badges you need for plans?
---
Small letters
---
I have the exact same problem
---
It’s just some kid trying to ruffle everyone’s feathers . They literally made SIX posts about the 10% vendor charge . He’s lonely 😔
---
So true, I’m seeing some amazing camps that are truly inspirational, yesterday there was one built around a cat spawn, a ginger and 3 black cats, the owner was keeping an eye on me watching them so I don’t know if they thought I was going to kill and eat them but I’m a cat lover so I took a couple of photo’s and did a heart emote lol. Cleared a lot of stash space and also picked up some bargains and came  across a 3* instigating deathclaw gauntlet which I took a fancy to this morning so I’m loving it, although I seem to be spending caps just as fast as I’m making them lol 😂
---
Maybe the ones that were typing that in the game world experienced side effects themselves from brainwashing etc and caused them to do it. Its fallout. Any number of things could be the cause. Accidental misspelling, intended for lore purpose, bug. Who knows
---
Harvest all of the mothman eggs in point pleasant, make them into omelettes and sell them to vendors. With hard bargain perk maxed you will get over 200 caps for all of the omelettes.
---
Works wonders! Group them, tag them, loot. Lots of folks can get in on the action.
---
It was enough to completely change playstyle for some. Workshops were busy, then abandoned once it was figured out that a workshop was nothing other than painting a pvp target on your base.  Now workshops are full again, and are still pvp targets, but you cant just go smash someone's base if they best you at pvp.
---
Used to have a spot out by the Emmett Mountain disposal site that had fairly level terrain and access to water, and two out of three ain't bad. Unfortunately this was back when a camp could be completely lost if somebody else's was placed in the same spot, so I never got around to building it back in the same place.
---
Your statement's still mostly accurate for the other 99% of the wasteland, though. Currently I'm set up under one of those high voltage towers near the Whitespring that's sorta kinda flat-ish and it has a coal deposit, but it's still kind of difficult to build around and coal isn't exactly a hot item so it's kind of not that great after all.
---
He was probably using serendipity.
---
Soon there'll be a new ban wave and dupers will blame Bethesda for not getting to play anymore.
---
Thank you.
---
Can you sell or trade backpack mods?
---
They can.
---
Is it still not patched?
---
Can we still find him even if we finished the quest? If yes I can boot my baby and search for you
---
Radroach: *exists*
---
Level 300+ boi in power armor: *reloads shotgun with malicious intent*
---
still work ..
---
Crap
---
Gonna pass on that. I like going to the Forest and other places to get away from high level bullet sponges for a bit.
---
Hope they all get banned
---
Picking up the wood feeds the fire, and you can also keep it for the next try.
---
well a shit ton of people duped at the start and from a full discord server maybe 10% were banned.
---
I have no idea, normally you should with it being a server based game.
---
Yeah if it works it works, I ran with Level 25 Excavator all the way until I could make X-01 at level 45. Definitely worth it.
---
I'm gonna search for you then
---
Yeah, thats how it is done. But some people pick it during last phase and don't feed fire, so we fail and that triggers me so much. I don't mind failing, progress is actualy fun, but not when you fail due to stupidity of other people.
---
More than likely they will bring it back. It looks like the roller door is coming back soon - https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blrkwo/patch_05_new_atomshop_datamine
---
really hope Bethesda learnt from previous mistakes to add a unique item id aswell as a way to track items where they end up. But I doubt they did any of that and only got a way to see if someone is carrying multiple stacks of an item. So legit stuff will tank in value now. THANKS B!
---
i presume you need to be teamed up?
---
Absolutely.
---
There is 25% chance same as for event: camfire tales
---
They probably are going to remove the stacked weapons but the other ones probably not
---
good to know. actually on that step right now on the PS4
---
I've done the even a lot, I've never had to make a trip to the fire.  At the end sometimes, it requires you to pick firewood to keep the fire fed during the "boss battle" this uses up the firewood, and people need to pick wood fast, not return to the fire.  Just pick 2 spots, grab all 3 pieces wet or dry, then go back and forth, and try to tag the legendary when it gets there.
---
Got my fifth weapon weight reduction piece last night... Managed to get my originally 20+ pound handmade down to 3lbs. Don't ask me the math, it doesn't make sense to me either. A fully modded lever action only weighs me down by 1.5lbs. Between this and the backpack, I'm actually excited to play again!
---
I o ow its an old post but .50 cal for hunting rifle exists and increases damage. Plans are at raider vendor bot Sunnytop station. They could be as well at raider bot in whitesprings. Didnt check that one.
---
That could be the case, but the super mutant was actually using his weapon normally, and the lasers actually hit and did damage. The poison effect was much stronger than the one a queen has. If I got hit one time, the poison would kill me in like 3 seconds
---
I don't follow? You can't damage camp without mutual PvP.
---
except you don't immediately ban. no online game does. they wait.
---
and then, eventually, they strike.
---
*laughs in Bear Arms*
---
And why you care about duping? Does it hurt your soul? Most of people were already running in duped outfits wielding duped weapons.
---
Ouu, good point. Thanks for pointing that out, I had forgotten about that perk. still kind of broken though.. it’s super luckbased with like 300,000 possible legendaries and the good ones are so rare But they DEMOLISH in pvp I’ve had it happen so many times where I can’t do any damage to people and they kill me in one hit. While I’m in PA  and there is no way to know what perks someone is running. I think if this game is gonna have a good pvp system the weapons and perks are going to need some major balancing changes. Right now it doesn’t seem fair at all
---
I can craft you something on pc. Just PM me your gamer tag. You have a mic?
---
I was at a camp doing a trade of a nuclear card I found and this lvl 300 dude rocks up and blasts a fucken lvl 5 radroach into the NetherRealm
---
You can rename the chassis..? I wish I had know this sooner.
---
Honestly if we get an emote like that some people will use it for trolling lol.
---
I go back to the forest to relax and not have to worry about wearing out my armor, guns or ammo.
---
Happened to me, too. Around 16 masses lost, and the stable flux drops from the Queen. So why are flux and mass even categorized as Junk to begin with?
---
Sounds like they aren't a high enough level for T-60.
---
Couldn’t be more true not gonna spend 500 caps on 500 10mm rounds that will be gone in 20 minutes.
---
I mean, while wearing power armor you *should* be able to smash a locked door down, or tear open a locked box, be it wood or metal. But that's the way it is.
---
Thats how i do it, if it is bug version, if there is wendigo i will oneshot it.
---
Yup anything level 14 or lower will die in a few seconds of standing near me
---
I have blackberries, melons growing at my camp so if someone sees me in game on xbox just swing by and grab some for the challenge
---
Hope not... I'm glad I got it when I did.. I never see it at someone's camp... other then my own
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I've seen the same happen with a glowing Snallygaster, among other creatures. Odd, for sure.
---
I deleted a pip boy statue and could fit 20 more items in the vendor. You really have nothing extra?  
---
I milked all my brahmin in the wild.
---
I did have a hard time getting someone to "die" turns out I had my mic setup wrong, fixed that and the very first person helped out.
---
Some of the expansion is also tied to new content not yet released.  It is ok we cannot complete every task the first week isn't it?
---
Every time I’ve done this event I’m the only one who’s fed the fire. Which is fine if you’re going to kill all the bugs and not just wait for the wendigo.
---
Ok thanks. I’ll try that next time I am on
---
But completing the two daily quests give one badge with 100% chance, right?
---
How is he blowing on that instrument? 🤔🤔🤔 *X-files theme plays*
---
That switch seems to be designed for electric doors, so it only gives you enough time to walk through.
---
Why one shot? When I do events I use a low level Tesla, and just tag dont even have to aim. Sure I could just kill everything, but I gain nothing, and everyone else loses. Use a crap gun for low level events.
---
.45 is pretty common, you shouldn't be paying any more than one cap per round if it's from a vending machine. Even less if you can negotiate a deal with the vendor personally instead of going through the machine.
---
Before Christmas, it also used to be possible to place a half-wall underneath a wall snapped to a foundation. It's a really minor thing, but I miss that. The foundations look sillier the higher they come out of the ground, but we have no way to blend them in anymore.
---
Same as Reddit handle laidbackleo87
---
I didnt see anything happening on my sales but I will keep from now on a closer eye on transactions. We reaaly could use some kond of info on every transaction that was made trough vending machines. Thanks for heads up!
---
Can we stop with this question/suggestion? It's posted everyday.
---
It's too high a level and you should have to have a list like quests.
---
There should be a HUD tracking option of items you select to track if they're within X meters.  So if I haven't taken a photo of the SBQ there should be a notification to do so... like searching for junk icons...
---
-G
---
In a nuclear fight everybody loses
---
Same case for me
---
I've had a pretty good time using my 10mm as a sidearm without even speccing into pistols very much, so I imagine you could get some good stuff going with a dedicated pistol build.
---
One thing I've heard, though, is that they suffer a bit in the late game if you're using them as a main weapon cause pistols don't get any armor-penetrating perks like other weapon types do.
---
Cranberry bog is a bad neighborhood. You might as well scrap your whole house and fill the camp budget with turrets.
---
Kind sir, setting prices are totally up to You! Dont mind others about it. Remember bussiness is bussiness😃
---
1400 atoms back at that time. Extremely expensive !
---
Isn't that what survial mode is?
---
weight perks dont work in stash
---
Can you tell us what to watch for, without giving away the method?
---
It spawned in the fridge for me. Just a normal melon works. Yes there’s one in the club house too.
---
I'm just worried when faction play comes in, it's going to be server dependent, and I doubt they'll let us rebuild fort defiance or Harper's ferry
---
This is just like Denmark. Lived my whole life like this.
---
(Sorry to hear tho)
---
Wow, now i feel stupid, my camp is near point pleasant, and i ate all the omelettes
---
Yeah! I love those new tadpole/possum challanges!
---
And use power armor at others bases
---
I guess it's still confined ti xbox,because i didn't see any improvement in the trash people sell at camps.
---
Oh sorry, edited
---
Sorry, on PC
---
Np! Thanks anyway!
---
old topic, but one of the best weapons to use it is a pipe rifle with a powerful automatic receiver, stabilized stock, a suppressor, stinging magazine, a reflex sight with a glow, and finally a suppressor. The point is to go commando with it and sneak. It can effectively pop Super Mutant Warlords at lvl 64 on it's own when you make the build
---
lemme guess your camp is near Charleston Station
---
At least you have someone show up. Ran it solo 8 times and only once someone else showed up. Still never failed it yet.
---
After the initial surge of atoms from completing one-time challenges, the flow of "free" atoms dries up pretty hard - only daily and weekly challenges, after that.
---
That is the point - they're not gonna give us a way to consistently get loads of atoms for free, cause then there would be nobody buying them.
---
He's well hidden, I found him for myself first try when I went looking for him but right now I can't find him, yet
---
Because there is time limit, legendaries that drop are 20lvl anyway. I am more happy to have badge, than some low level legendary.
---
same here i'm still fast travelling to al the spots
---
You may be right then. I might make a note, thanks
---
I have 13 badges just from that. If drop rate is 25% i have to do it 52times. Usualy solo. Few times there were good people, and few those **** who made me fail
---
Items you're selling do *not* take up camp budget. If you get that message it's a bug and relogging will fix it. What on earth are you hoarding that takes up your entire stash space? I have a lot of food and drink but I craft high quality items so that's why. Occasionally I need to clean it out and sell or scrap some junk. Whatever it is, if you're jot using it get rid of it. There's no point holding onto it.
---
Wow, just wow.
---
Any chance of showing where Deathclaw hide's spawn? I have looted one from somewhere, but can't remember where and the damn Possum Leatherworker challenge need 5 of those.
---
Nope there is 25% chance to get badge doing the two dailies or event.
---
100% are only challenges, but they are pain in the a**
---
I'd say this is not true as some of the duping methods have been around for months and havent been patched. 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Nice! I'm eager to get myself the +81 armoe from the armor plated mod. :)
---
It's pretty clear that they have no way of watching us play in real time. They can take snapshots of our inventories and stash, probably when we log in and out, but they can't track them live.
---
Remember, this is a low level event in the forest. Probably the new "first place" for people to get any legendary stuff. Not everyone is doing it backwards like us.
---
Perhaps this was a result of the most recent patch, or maybe it's the quest itself, but I instinctively server hopped yesterday during the new Dolly Sods quest when one of the locations had been cleared. Thankfully, the quest reactivated when I logged back in. All progress was kept (tracked).
---
Also, the quest reset at a specific time of day, unlike the other daily quests that typically become available 20+ hours after completion/failure. I've not tested to see if all dailies have been updated like that. 
---
Also... The Atom Store daily discount has been edited? The end of a sale coincides with the reset for this new scout quest. That's 4-5pm for me. It used to reset at 1am.
---
The struggle is real between trying to decide if the price is too good to be true, so they must be shit effects or if the price is really high as a master jebait.
---
Enjoy. Play adventure mode
---
Performance.
---
Todd talks about it here https://youtu.be/-zIQaXj8h6o?t=2329
---
100% this lol I've bought a couple of stinkers, but luckily managed to flip them for a profit somehow.
---
try looking at the mothman statue in point pleasant also
---
I've also set up one of these in the Ash heap. I "sell" .38 rounds for 0 caps, because  I remember the first time I was in the ash heap I was underleveled and stubborn and that could have helped!
---
Are you on PC?
---
Don't listen to anything someone tells you about the game. Just enjoy it for yourself.
---
My girlfriend got a random message to come to whitesprings. Met a guy who had 8 or 10 old man winter masks and wanted to trade. She fuckin ran. Won't touch that shit with a 10 foot pole. Didn't even get a price.
---
Nope.
---
You can milk brahmin.
---
I haven't seen anyone complain yet. But I have seen some people selling serums for like 1-5k caps. 
---
Just before I went to one base. 1k each. Noped right out to the next base. What did they have? 250 caps. I will take that one and that one and that one. Thank you kind sir.
---
Yeah sure I got time!
---
Tag: Titaniuxs
---
Hi Bethesda, 
---
May you please fix the problem on inviting a teammate in game.
---
It only works when all of my friends are on the main menu. 
---
During the game, it will tell you that the invitation was declined... so we all have to stop playing and go to the main menu to be in a team.
---
Thats why i have never seen low level around it.
---
I get your point, and i don't oneshot legendaries on othet places, i just don't want to fail event, because other peoples are too slow.
---
Use a bash on weak enemies like scorched at morgantown airport or charlston .
---
Unpopular opinion: RNG sucks, drop rates was worse than it is now, and when duping was rampant, what it did was level the field for majority of the playerbase. The guns I used in January/February were probably duped, because honestly I didn't pay much for them. I bought few dozens. Been giving them away since, made their day for dozens of people.
---
Personal opinion: the game matured, RNG is at better place, new RNG vendor is coming so at least people using melee who only drop pistols will be able to refocus their RNG. I'm all in for using the banhammer now. Myself I found a new dupe glitch by an accident in patch7, reported it immidately, I don't know if it still works because I haven't tried it again. This glitch immidately kicked the player out of server, without hard save - rolling back your inventory. I found it by repeating the same junk route 10 times, loosing all I gathered in the process. Its obscure and there is no information I gave here that would help people find it.
---
Oh damn, that's quite a lot actually. I was thinking about getting the extra carry weight mod, but that sounds pretty handy as well.
---
High Cap is 120 carry weight, -60 ER and -60 RR :(
---
I believe the others are +80 the appropriate stat (Insulated is ER, Lead is RR, etc).
---
Refrigerated doesn't stack with Good With Salt from what I understand.
---
Unless you just farm Campfire Tales over and over, there are only a few working Possum Challenges. Some can't be completed (Leatherman and Robotics both require access to Taxidermy and Encryptid) while others require plans that aren't the easiest to find (Chemist requires plasma grenades, Robotics requires a full set of Robot).
---
So TL;DR choose wisely. High Cap penalty is awful.
---
hahaha, there's also usually a load of chems in the point plesant church that are good for selling too :)
---
And what if I give you the bucket list? Will it work? I also have a spare camera deluxe
---
Yup. It's one of the ways you get the badges (the other is doing Pioneer Scout events)
---
Do you know now if it stacks?
---
Well.. To be honest and not look through rose-tinted glasses, game is still a huge buggy mess. But way better now than it was on launch. But because the price has gone down to \~10e range (on cdkey stores) i recommend trying it. It is still fun for couple weeks, until later on you realise that there arent much to do (little to none end game).
---
I know, i always farm junk there, but i didn't know chems sell good
---
I’ve done it solo nearly every time or someone shows up right at the end.
---
we could try
---
You have to pay them then.
---
Got him at landview lighthouse if you haven’t found him yet
---
what's your psn?
---
Puxewonka
---
I picked up 38 explosive laser rifles how was I supposed to know id be banned?!?!?!?!
---
This is why I have to get a new Brahman every time I come to my camp and my Decontamination shower is broken.
---
yes
---
haven't found him yet
---
Only paying customers are allowed in to my cabin.
---
Titaniuxs
---
well turns out this other dude found him
---
still lot's of love for the time you spent helping
---
This is the correct answer. It works as intended except for the notification.
---
If by that you mean those ash scorched people standing like statues, nothing. Absolute nothing.
---
See shyyfty's post.
---
Ah nice! You can finally suffer all of the picture you're supposed to take ahahah
---
🙄
---
🤔 no wonder im broke
---
Please don't remind me :(
---
Pretty sure it doesn't. Same for the legendary effect "move faster while aiming" they are all essentially the same.
---
Damn i hear say that but there's also people who say it does stack. Did seriously no one ever try?
---
Someone give this guy a raise.
---
Prime dupe weapons right there. I'm sorry but I have informed Todd Howard and he is very disappointed in you.
---
If I'm remembering correctly, Incisor is the perk for bypassing armour with melee weapons. I use that perk on 3* at all times.
---
Without it, takes me 5-10 hits with my Deathclaw Gauntlet to kill the most difficult Super Mutants (not including boss or legendary varieties).
---
With it, it only takes 1-2 hits to kill the same enemies.
---
Having any kind of armour penetration makes a HUGE different when fighting armoured enemies, so the 75% melee penetration is really good to have.
---
It fucks up with the economy of the game, why buy from other players trying to make caps when you can get 100 of the same item for free?
---
Do you want to buy my explosive minigun? I need to check what the first star is.
---
Yeah saw that too recently. Thought the rats were going to attack me. LOL'd when they just filed past.
---
Do they speak English in PVP?
---
Thank you!!!!! I thought I lost my mind but once late night like so late it's turning morning all the super mutants in West Tek were acting like schorched. With the weird tweaker movements, 1 handing rifles, taking cover and running super fast. 
---
No joke it was the most fun I have ever had such a challenge and worth all the ammo. Wish Bethesda would make super mutants more like this.
---
I'm pretty sure it is bugged on ps4. The quest is supposed to start when you go to Paladin Grants terminal in Fort Defiance, but instead it starts anytime you enter Cranberry bog.
---
It also starts at the collect viable DNA stage when it should start with going to Vault Tec University and powering up the centrifuge. 
---
Instead it gives you no option to power it up at the power terminal and no option to analyze it at the main terminal. Going to Fort Defiance first triggers the quest automatically at the DNA stage as soon as you fast travel there because its part of the Cranberry Bog. Three days of trying different things and I've found no way around it.
---
Yeah I'm getting that a lot. Have to keep exiting build mode then go back in to fix it. Really tedious.
---
Thanks, I'll try that.
---
Unfortunately, a lot of these people are wise to how this works. They all have burner accounts
---
I have try everything for Max speed in the past.
---
Speed demon does not stack with everything. The only way to get a little bit faster as speed demon is emergency protocol and a weapon with move speed while aiming. I run a long time only weapons with move speed while aiming but the speed booster with emergency protocol is so low (maybe 3% more) that speed demon is much better course it gives you +25% reload speed on every weapons :)
---
I think forest,ash heap,toxic valley
---
There is 25k cap anyway. You can make it in few days with those vending machines.
---
Bethesda will fix duping when they will be able to.
---
If you care about economy then don't buy from people who look like dupers.
---
Ah thank you very much. But since i use the emergency protocols already i wonder if it's even worth getting speed demon since it only gives me a reload speed buff
---
I know how u feel :"(  Other than the mega rocket sign, I also purchased those Christmas packs..... Christmas trees for 1200 atoms, Waiving Santa for 700, magic of the season for 2000 and the Santa PA for 1000....
---
Rip my hard earned atoms.

If you give me 2 grenades I'll kill myself for you in the river at flatwoods

There’s a handy google spreadsheet you can use, going around. Do a little search.

Don't be afraid to die and explore the green area of the map first before moving out
---
I need to do this too if you help me I'll help you... Gt MeanAssChic22
---
Keep searching. I've came across 2 .50 cal TSE 3* and 3 TSE 2* shotguns at camp vendors. None were over 13k caps. I bought my tse vats cost .50 cal for 9k caps.
---
imo if you have good gear for your level you could start to reach into the savage divide
---
Speed demon is better course you got 2 free skill points on agi for other skills if you unequip emergency protocols +  the same speed + reload speed
---
Ye ok but we have to jump off a cliff into water (using grenades don't let me revive u)
---
Ok sounds good to me...
---
Not everyone. I went up against a guy that spoke French yesterday. Is it important to only speak english when playing in pvp? 😂
---
yeaz
---
The thing is i use emergency protocols for the 50% dmg reduction since i use bloodied weapons. The increased speed is just a bonus. And what 2 free skill points are you talking about?
---
Gt same as reddit going to spruce lake rn
---
Before you start, go online and look at a fo76 build planner.
---
This will let you browser through all the perks in the game, so that you have an idea on what you'd like your character to do and how many points to put into each special stat.
---
While you can re-spec normally in-game, you need to wait til level 50 to be able to do this AND you can only re-spec one point at a time. This becomes a huge annoyance, if like me, you reach level100+ and want to change play-styles.. you've now got to gain a level for each point you want to move. AND another level for each rank of any new perk cards you need but didn't unlock yet.
---
I'd honestly pay $10 to do a complete re-spec on my character, so that I could choose all the special stats and perk cards I now need for my build instead of heavily grinding day after day to slowly re-spec my character over the course of weeks.
---
TL:DR - Look up a build planner and get some idea of what kind of character/play-style you want before you start, because it's a pain in the ass to re-spec later once you've reached high-level/endgame content.
---
in options- display. not too many games actually have that
---
Where is it in the menus? I can't seem to find it
---
I really need that perk then. I guess I should just replace gladiator.
---
Well I have 5 characters for which I'd have to do that thing and honestly, F76 scratches a certain itch for me, but the scout stuff does not. I'm happy for new content being added and I'll happily finish it at my own pace - but I wont go through all this stuff with all of my characters, and I'd happily pay 25k for 5 backpacks so that I could get this done with and be able to do the quests without the mindset like "finish it ASAP because otherwise I don't have the intellectual capabilities to operate inventory management tool that was the very first inventory management tool I have been taught to use as a kid IRL". Feels kinda degrading.
---
I tried caring for it and promptly found out what a big pile of poop it is.
---
I have been looking for one
---
Sorry man.
---
I hope they sort it out in the next round of bug fixes.
---
Lol kind of funny. I guess they were confused.
---
My 2 star explosive double barrel and 3 star AAE combat shotgun both do almost 300 dmg if I have all shotgun perks and full bloody mess perks engaged.  Better yet, start blasting with enforcer 3 and adrenaline 5 and put down some chems like psycho and med-x and those weapons will carpet bomb just about anything.
---
Yeah. Even if only 2* version.. I'd take +50% armour penetration over +15% damage any day.
---
On unarmored enemies, the extra damage is a better choice. Since most enemies have some kind of armour though the armour penetration is way much useful.
---
It was fixed to be 8/hr with the capacity still at 3 cores. So come back every 22.5 mins.
---
Enemies take pot shots from the nearby workshop, too far to hit though. Any that get close to the welcome area get missiles rained down upon them!
---
Except it's just a funky UI error and nothing major at all.
---
That’s called grind. It’s in the game for a reason
---
Its not the case where 90% of the community hates pvp and wants more rp element's added. Human Npcs would be a start.
---
Also an issue on PSN!
---
Headed to you now
---
It's menu then video I think
---
Or maybe strong back?
---
Todd Howard is my dad. I am going to dob on him straight away.
---
I don’t even like BR in games like COD so absolutely no interest in a BR with pretty shitty shooting mechanics. I mean, they’re fine for bots but I really don’t like it for PVP.
---
I check it but you get those badges from the dailies dont you? I could have sworn I had 3 badges last time I went over there but had yet to finish the backpack. Regardless I guess the badges are something to do if nothing else.
---
Got a two shot heavy plasma sat in mine, hoping someone buys it soon or I'll be taking it to the legendary dump...
---
Around lvl 20 you should be expanding into Ash heap and Toxic valley.
---
If it adds new items I can use in adventure mode that would be great!
---
Gotta be at the main menu though don't think you can change it while in game.
---
Yeah, extra dialogue where the surprise isn't about you trying, but about how it worked!
---
Sorry I thought it was death man sprint haha. Emergency protocols what was it exactly? A mod for PA or I miss something?
---
if you are on ps4 i could craft you something
---
handmade/gauss/lever action for example
---
gauss is for lvl 35 though
---
&gt; Managed to get my originally 20+ pound handmade down to 3lbs
---
What perk reduces rifle weight I didnt think there was any?
---
If you fail a this mission because “other people” are too slow, then you   are the “other people”. There is no reason to time fail that mission unless you are a level 1.
---
Vertibot and cargobot need to be ridiculously close to you when you take the picture. And I mean less than 2 meters / 6'7".
---
These people don’t know what they’re talking about. You cannot change your fov on both ps4 and xbox.
---
Don’t pick the wet kindling and you won’t get bugs. Learn what to use young pioneer scouts. Onward and Upward.
---
I've never seen my camp load this slowly. I started in the beta and came back recently after a couple month hiatus, and it takes at least 5 minutes to slowly put itself together. I've been taking damage at least once per session from invisible enemies. Loading into areas, I can often see everything for around 10-30 seconds before I can move, but I sure as hell can be attacked while loading. That being said I'm really happy with all the other improvements.
---
I saw some jicky jack selling serums for like 3K apiece.  Better yet, he had like 20 each for sale. Same guy had everything overpriced - stimpaks, ammo, etc.  He gets a big FU from me.’
---
Not that I have any great advice but if you are looking for the best deal just keep shopping around.  People do price things to sell.  Kind of like ammo.  You price shells for 2-3 caps each I’m moving on as I know at most places I can get them 1 cap each.
---
Yes it's a mod for PA. It increase movement speed and reduced dmg intake by 50%
---
have a AAE Assault Rifle +1 Perception?
---
Well you can't feed fire when other people pick all wood. Is it so hard to understand?
---
It's a legendary armor effect!
---
could always run through the building with a tesla power armor upgrade, trickles of damage tags everything you walk past, great for whitesprings leveling
---
If you use troubleshooters armor he hardly tickles you
---
I have 2 characters at level 30-34, they have been in   savage divide since level 4, it all depends on you and if you can get somone to craft you max mode'd weapons for you level :)
---
The emergency protocol mod really stacks up against the Queen, I barely have to move just aim and shoot (y)
---
Wrong subreddit
---
Hey! I see a lot of “percentage” damage comparison in this post, but what are your real world numbers? I’m doing ~250 damage a swing with my Sheepsquatch Club, all 9 gladiator points. 
---
You also mentioned bloodied. I’ve definitely seen bloodied builds snagging +1k on melee weapons - but i don’t feel bloody is a fair comparison, because there is a heavy trade off with being a glass cannon. 
---
Or is all of this an argument mostly due to PVP? I can see this being a real pain there (like the mention of the 105% DR).
---
If he hasn't done the quest yet... He can now no longer craft it himself!
---
I had them there for 20caps for few hours, noone bought one. They are too heavy and too easy to get, to be worth selling.
---
I'll hope it was just a bug &amp; not bethesda reversing it because they got caught.
---
Hasnt the 200% condition bonus been completely patched out for melee /armor now? On PS4 i get zero bonus for my armor @ 200% now compared to 100% and below.
---
Oh cool, I have 1 piece that reduces weapon weights by 20%, I assume this is a near full set of that armour then?
---
I love it!
---
+karma thanks for the help
---
Also if it helps, tea time is a great way to farm most of the pieces needed.
---
I am joining this, if someone is willing to borrow his plan, i would like to give him few caps.
---
If you want you shop to have a on/off switch, but don't want others to be able to turn off your shop (assuming that's why you used a keypad switch), you can do what I did.. wire it up to a normal switch, but then have that switch is a room that's only accessible by keypad.
---
That way it can be turned on and off, but only by people you give the door code to.
---
Pretty sure I got my T60 calibrated shock mod at Watoga train station for about 300-400 caps. It was a long time ago but that’s what I remember.
---
It will stack with each other yes, not sure if a full set will as there is a cap to how far it drops!
---
+karma thank you
---
Happened to me to , in the growe . Oneshotted me two times before i was able to sneak up on him :-)
---
You can change it from the main menu under settings. This guy doesn’t know what he’s talking about
---
Thanks for the reply. That’s good to know, cheers.
---
Oh I never mind that is so good for Bloodied build haha thanks :D
---
If you are a PA user only then speed demon is not really needed but if you play not all the time in PA then it's useful
---
It's just timing, it pops every second hour or so. My pointing out that my home is the PH backyard was to illustrate that, as I spend much time there, that I guarantee you it isnt broken and its just the TIME that you are around the PH that is keeping you from getting that quest. Being around a lot, I often show up and it doesn't pop. then I start crafting and within fifteen minutes it pops. Sometimes when I arrive after travelling, sometimes as soon as I arrive, sometimes when I get close to the Gutsy, but mostly when Im standing around my CAMP. Just play in the general area for an hour or two and Im sure it will pop. 
---
It doesn't trigger just because you show up, it's a timer since last completion by another player before it will allow itself to cycle again :)
---
That's what I figured, but some but just bought 20 from me for 18c each. Idk man
---
Hmm okay thanks
---
I’m in the main menu right now for Xbox one. Literally no fov slider. However, there is a depth of field slider.
---
i'm just talking about the stats that differ by a huge amount between armor on 200% and lower...idk if there was a bonus, to me just seems to be either a bug or intended. but armor defense stats shouldn't drop by 50 pts or lower just because losing like 10-30% condition...the more as it's still over 100%.
---
sry, my english isn't the best so not sure if i got u right. hope at least my point is understandable.
---
heres a tip, get rank 1 of gladiator, expert gladiator and master gladiator. together thats 3 perk points and 30% more damage over a rank 3 gladiator for 20% ;)
---
People tell me moving the C.A.M.P. device moves your fast travel point, alas it does not for me and is always a random position!
---
Theres also some floating liberators above the (train yard?) opposite Poseidon Power Plant, not the actual train station but directly east of the power plant
---
I purposely keep the prices of the MGs and Gatlings low to try and get my stash back
---
The main quest brought me to the top of the world and the enemies have been a bit difficult to take on my own.
---
If I see some in the 15-20 range I usually grab them if I have spare caps
---
I see anywhere from 5 to 8. Might be worth testing out to see—18c might have been the outlier.
---
I assume its 20% off each new total and not 20% the original weight each time
---
That is not accurate at all. The kindling respawns quickly. So quickly you can go from one side of camp to the other then back and it has re appeared.  I know this because my camp is right outside the pioneer boundary so this is now the first quest I do when logging in. Never failed once.
---
Great stuff! This is what i like, outside-the-box thinking instead of just nerfing realism
---
Hmm... is this a PS4 thing or is it also possible on Xbox and Pc ? :)
---
Holy shit thanks so much! Now I just need to level up and acquire the cards now. You have my thanks!
---
The act of picking kindling not Wood (there is a difference) automatically feeds the fire. It’s not  difficult.
---
There was a bonus until recently for being above 100% condition on all platforms.I'm on  PS4 and I no longer get a bonus for repairing to 200% the sbonus only increases ballistic defence and gives 80%ish more
---
There used to be chickens at my camp when i logged inn but of course they are gone now  !  Just up the hill from the Behemoth in the lake ..
---
I may have just found a way around it, I went to Fort Defiance and it automatically triggered so I closed the game and restarted so the quest wouldnt be active anymore. Once I did that I was able to go to Grants terminal and start the quest like usual from the beginning.
---
It's the shop system being tied to the stash, it lags out the servers! If they were tied to a seperate container it wouldn't be an issue!
---
On any system, but only carry capacity work this way from my knowleage.
---
Actual use? None. From what is speculated, when the scorch have no use to the Sierra Bravo menace, like killing or spreading to noninfected creatures, they super heat from the inside and turn to those stone variations. They crumble nicely, maybe to spred the virus to passersby? Who knows.
---
I had a guy sitting in my bar/lounge/sales area watching charred bloated ghouls smacking the shit out of a water purifier.
---
After I took care of them I did the “???” Emote and he opens mic and says “I wanted to see how long it would take them to target me instead.”
---
They’re not gonna you nit.
---
as enemys scale to the level of the player who enters the area it could be that they were lvl 50 or so due to a prior visitor that didnt bother to kill them( happens at the top of the world because people go ther to grind the tincanchains for lead) maybe try again and see if it works for you otherwise do as the first commenter said and go around the toxic valley and the ash heap
---
also if you play on ps4 i could help ypu out with your equipment i could make you a decent suit of armor as well as a hand full of good weapons
---
i would just tell you the required ressources but wouldnt charge you any more than the materials
---
They will but it's imo better to put the. In the flatwoods or overseers box
---
Was it on Xbox?
---
I use to sell them on the market for 5c but even at that no one buys them. Idk maybe everyone learned how to farm em.
---
Man i have 13bages from it, i grinded that shit two days. If you are i  last phase, and you notice you are in half of timer, there is no time to run across whole area two times. But you are probably god and can do everything. No point to argue with you..........
---
I would love a 25v25 in this game
---
I sell them 10 caps each at my camp, PS4.
---
Those stairs have always bugged out your base! Never EVER use them if you want to adjust your base!
---
You must pick it and then use fire. It is not automatic
---
Cool thanks
---
I hope Bethesda can separate vending store and stash.
---
To look on the bright side legacy weapons aren't as rare anymore
---
The fixer would be perfect for you.
---
I wear patrolman sunglasses
---
its a general problem in my opinion
---
same with the guys that run violent night/ uranium fever and just oneshot the legendarys on sight
---
anyone with lvl50+ could do that guys just make sure to get a hit in and give others the chance or just dont attend those events please its selfish and unnecessary to do so
---
You 'might' get them.
---
I have done the 'dailies' every day since Tuesday, no badge from those.
---
I have done the Camp Adams event 11 times, 1 badge.
---
I have been full on grinding the challenges but thanks to the most 'accesible' ones (at least to me, your mileage might vary) being bugged I am still at 7 badges...
---
Hopefully I will manage to finish Backpacker and/or Metalworker after lunch and I will finally manage to get the fridge mod.
---
Fuck me this has been a grind.
---
Yes, let us craft mods at the tinkering station, I would actually sell a ton
---
Beautiful
---
Just let us bulk ammo
---
No in a BR you don’t respawn.
---
That’s what I’m saying, except that we get to choose how much to bulk together.
---
Santa PA was awesome
---
There’s one at the Morgantown Airport lol and it’s been there since I got the game back in December
---
Playing since launch, must've missed them. lol
---
That is excellent news!
---
Good luck!
---
I think I'd they robots, this will be added, give the robot items, and the robot walks around on a path you choose and sells items
---
yes, goes rapidly down, and i just 'd like to know if a bug or to promote repair kit sales?!
---
PS4 here and same thing happening to me
---
My wife had the exact same issue last night and nearly drive her insane! I did the fix by moving her stairs etc after realising the issue. But yeah really really buggy. Not to mention that the stair frames (not standard stairs) when stacked  on top of each other won't be recognised as a second set of stairs so you have to put in ordinary ones as well. 
---
Definitely a bug and definitely needs fixing
---
I think they might e made it so you ha e to hit a certain amount, because of people shooting at once and hiding
---
Fusion generator didn’t work for me but small standard generator did
---
You're most likely correct
---
i dont think its the case for this outfit as it previously offered no dr at all and now offers 1 dr i think never seen a mod for it either so i can not see how this is the way its intended to work
---
and as the other guy said its that way since the beta so i highly doubt bethesda will adress this in the near future
---
Before they "fixed" the Ghouls rad damage I used to tank hits for low level players, now I don't really bother attending anymore.
---
Thanks for the friendly offer and the helpful info! But I prefer scavenging for my equipment.
---
91 armor
---
Alright I can confirm it worked, I just completed the quest without any problems.
---
no problem i can understand that if you do so try to attend the uranium fever event whenever it pops up the enemys might be hard for you but usually there ar always one or two people to attend the event and it guarantees for 3 legendary moleminers lvl 40 which have a good chance of dropping loot you could use
---
Hmm might need to get a more damaging gun, I emptied a lot of 5mm rounds into her. Oh well, there always another one 😁
---
I really like how it looks but the problem is I never use power armor. 😂
---
Worse since Vfast melee weapons do more damage!
---
Thanks! I'll check it out if it pops up on the map.
---
i guess the skull bandana would give a nice desperado look
---
As a solo player without a mic I got very lucky with this one! 
---
In the location where you get the quest I saw another dude and thought he probably had just gotten the same quest as me so I proceeded to use the "follow me" emote and let myself get killed by some enemies so he at least could get the quest right there and, without communication, he was kind enough to do the same!
---
no worries, worked that out when i got my first expert card, noticed that they only went up 5% per rank but each one card starts at 10, so i religiously abused this for all my damage cards. i even put aside extra points to get some rank 2 perception damage boosters in case i'm fine dropping my magazine/bobblehead tracking perks for a total of 35% buff (rank 1 10% rank 1 10% rank 2 15%) :)
---
Only if you will remember to close it, after
---
...You have to price it all again? Omg no
---
I have met with more players since patch than in the last three months (not including SBQ event).
---
Thanks to all the customers for coming to visit and buying my accumulated stuff.
---
Depends on your build, if unarmed melee you're set for the whole map, if not, explore the savage divide, or the mire!
---
This is accurate, and something I was tempted to do a PSA about.  If they are holding three pylons, they will last longer as DBNO than standing, they just need to be hidden from the main fight and people need to be aware to stim them in the last 5 seconds to keep it going.
---
i thinks thats solomans pond i will check it out, i haven't any luck yet thanks
---
It's my favorite. Has been since day one. Every patch I try it on to see if it's been fixed. :(
---
I've been finding those cameras a lot in tool boxes.
---
I don't know if you need the tourist body for the quest to get lenses, but seems weird to find those cameras around as you can not get anything from them after you have one.
---
No wonder why I can't find any
---
Add level 3 Blocker.
---
Yep , coldnt remember the name :-)
---
I agree though. I really like them
---
Strong back is worse than any weight reduction perk. Strong back only gives 40 weight in 4 cards, each of the other ones could lower your weight by thousands!
---
For you to loot them, and then get irradiated in the process - and immediately realize that 99% of the time it was not worth it to loot them.
---
Let me out,  LET ME OUT!
---
(If you was ported inside)
---
Not just farm, I make them and it’s pretty easy. Doesn’t require a lot and then the chemist and super duper perk makes it even better
---
Seriously? Personally I don't care much for PvP, but there's so many way better BR games out there. Sorry guys, but what you're trying to achieve will just turn to shit :(
---
Have same issues with musician, photographer and electrician badges.
---
Lmao flawless 🙌🏻
---
Area text chat would be seriously helpful! 
---
In ESO you can type in group/zone/area/yell (a larger area). You press the touch pad and options simultaneously to pull up the in game keyboard (PS4). 
---
Sure, it can feel quite cumbersome for a long winded text, but the option is there and it works great imo.
---
Dear God, the 1x2 stairs thing killed me. I had to completely move my base to remove them and delete it out of my stored items. Was so extremely frustrating.
---
If they have to go through a wall, at least it will slow them down enough for my turrets to deal with them.  Nine times out of ten anyways.
---
i visited a couple of locations in the toxic valley with my second character and the challenge completed (i had already visited them with my first character), the pioneer ones will get patched at some point but for now they can't be completed
---
And let us sell a full set on the frame from displays!
---
I ramp my intelligence up to 48 and craft the best possible power armour. I also grind out flux to make a full excavator set (with the high intel) with calibrated shocks, then sell them. I do it all through PC trading forums because I can't list the frame for sale at my camp. I suppose they'd also need you to inspect it and see the pieces too though.
---
It rests daily. If thats what u mean
---
False, you just need to use wasteland whisperer to tame them now!
---
I think you have to much faith, I guarantee their are multiple dupes out there, that have possibly been known for a few patches, that the people who have discovered them, stay quiet and tell nobody there is a dupe
---
That's kinda what I meant by farm not pharmafarm.
---
I also want to trample the flowers at Whitesprings!  Like I get a warning from the robots then the just mow you down.
---
The shot a bear, ragstag, and wolf with a syringer for chemist isn't working either
---
Yeah that is because you didn't do enough damage. I had an interesting bug, I didn't get any flux on the last Queen kill, those are usually a guaranteed quest reward!
---
I’ve had this happen consistently when I speed demon into an area while the game struggles to load in in time.
---
That’s pretty cool.  Love the part about the cats!
---
After seeing all of the cool ideas of camps, it makes me want to reimagine my shop.  
---
I sell a lot of weapons, Power Armor and mutations and I love it when I can help people get what they’re looking for.
---
The lvl 40 XO1 is one of the things I love selling.  Oh the joy it brings to our fellow wastelands.  😁
---
I rocked up at a vendors site and it was under attack. I killed the enemy but they were still around in a barn further away, so i went there killed them all and the vendor suddenly appears...name witheld..but 25 lvls higher than me and kills me??? I did not have a chance to return fire. What point is that..did I do wrong?
---
I love coming back to my base and there’s a level 80 Scorchebeast
---
Thanks for sharing! 
---
I really need to start watching these panels to keep on top of things
---
We need a "facepalm" emote.
---
only the rifle damage increase perks are a must have but any perk related to rifes should work, i use tank killer with my build (ignore armor) and glow sight (increased damage to glowing enemies)
---
Just check containers! Mostly safes and office-type containers
---
20 hours but close enough.
---
I think you are talking about fusion cores which I sell for 1/2 of their condition. Plasma cores are ammo for plasma gatlings.
---
My bloodied melee used to be able to tank a couple of Queen swipes with dodgy and blocker. Now she one shots me if the radiation spikes of 200 per tic coming off her doesn't first!
---
I believe it's the Prosnap Deluxe, not Photomode that you have to use.
---
Yea, they can, I've seen it multiple times, I used to use the syringer to farm bloatfly meats n such, made a box frame to do it in, they would CONSTANTLY open the door and start to fly out.
---
Rests??? I thought it would remember my scrip totals each time I sold an item otherwise what is the point of selling? Sorry missing some think here I think.
---
Well I'd never doubt your moral or intellectual superiority, so thank you.
---
exactly.
---
I make a lot is caps selling purified water. I have two industrial water purifiers in my camp and they produce way more water than I need. I also cook and sell all the glowing meat I get since it has a pretty high cap value. Glowing blood is good to sell too. Go to the prison east of Grafton and collect the straight jackets - they sell for 30 caps each (if you google it there are probably walkthroughs showing exactly where each one is.)
---
Another easy way to get quick caps is to equip the Green Thumb perk (the one that gives you double on everything you harvest) and harvest every plant you find and sell those. Plant a whole bunch of razor grain/tatos/corn in your camp (which handily you can also use with your purified water to make adhesive) and then harvest them with green thumb equipped (I only equip it when I need to.) And/or go to Billings Homestead (SW of Flatwoods) and harvest everything in the fields around it and the farm next to it (there’s a tonne of corn and razor grain.)  The Flatwoods vendor is in easy walking distance. It all only sells for 1 cap each but you’ll get hundreds at a time. They respawn relatively quickly too I think. 
---
You can claim the Billings Homestead workshop too to give you a free fast travel point to it and then you get caps every time you defend it.
---
SBQ, there spawn tones of hight level enemies.
---
West tek, robco center, the burrows
---
Try Whitespring Hotel. The body will be either immediately in front or to the right of you lying on a car
---
Great info! Also missing the one that spawns in the cage inside the Nuka-Cola Factory.
---
It’s gone bro sorry :(
---
Especially the decon shower is pricy to repair every so often...
---
Gone
---
You can TRY dropping an ammo at the top
---
Sometimes it will teleport the baggy
---
Not sure if it does so for dropped loot though
---
That’s not how you use the words “triggers” FYI. And this is so insanely unkind all the way around. If you don’t like multiplayer games with, yes, it’s occasional downfalls, then maybe you should delete the game. 🤷‍♀️
---
I always thought it would be cool to have the occasional high level enemy or horde wander through, not stay permanently but to walk from one end and disappear.
---
Imagine being a level 10 and seeing a level 60+ rad scorpion or something stomp it's way through.
---
You’d enjoy r/fo76filthycasuals more. It’s for people who enjoy the game , this subs for little kids crying about nothing
---
That might be the one that I found that you could build in. Had everything you'd need like a bed etc, but they were all covered in items that made them inaccessible. Plus there was no way to secure the door properly.
---
I only camp in pre existing structures, and I'd love to find a more viable one of these to make my own.
---
Fallout 4 had a similar issue where +End from legendaries didn't give HP.  It would from direct bonuses like clothing and chems etc, but the legendary fortifying enchant wouldn't.  It would still add to the special stats and reduce the AP cost of sprinting however.
---
Basically the way stats are applied to default gear differs to the way legendary enchants are applied, which it seems hasn't been fixed (since Fo4).
---
Good to know however, as the End stat is pretty useless without the HP bonus.
---
It was PC. He built so far up enemies were spawning on his camp. Like I was getting shot by scorched 1 story down and this guy had like 20 stories.
---
I addition, big Fred's BBQ, the dam south of thunder mountain,
---
of then the random spawn on the road between Fred's and bog town spawns a dozen of them, as well as in bog town itself, though these can also be scorched or ghouls
---
often a couple can be found fighting the bots on the north end of Watoga.
---
Right, definitely need a better gun 😂😁
---
Sneak attacks with AA gatling, takes just a few hits if you can stay hidden. They don't hit very hard, nothing like the Mr. Gutsys with the armor piercing guns. Come to think of it, sentry bots should get an automatic version of that gun to make them a bit more dangerous. Right now, they're a joke.
---
I just got some info on this. This means you were reported for something. After the disaster this last patch, apparently they are being very sensitive.
---
There is a group of people (who shall remain nameless) that mass duped some some rare Fasnacht masks then dumped them for everyone to take for free then reported them to Bethesda in total troll fashion.
---
A sledgehammer. Doesn't matter about build at that level, a sledge and PA will get you through pretty much anything.
---
When you consider an Endurance card can give 10 physical + 10 energy resist,  having the radiation resistance one be only +10 is very low budget.  Should be 25 per card to be comparable, but also an issue is the radiation damage in Fo76 is greatly increased vs Fo4 (which also used the 10RR per perk point), pretty much tripling across the board.
---
there is a exp ore in the forest, place a extractor on it and you can melt them for real exp on you chemistry bench ,lol  (just had to, only trying to be funny)
---
From what I've read, you can use those broken cameras to make a new camera of you lost it. But you need to find the tourist to start the quest and get your actual first camera.
---
Yeah, you could layer some of the walls in pretty cool ways. I had a metal door wall with a wooden window wall for a while and while it was subtle (no idea anyone else even noticed it wasn't standard) I certainly liked it.
---
Thanks :)
---
Respects
---
You can wear it at low levels... Its not just for level 50s and above
---
AA doesn’t work on energy weapons. Both are bad.
---
Exactly this.
---
If I fast travel from far away it puts me at my own spawn which is shit.
---
If I fast travel to my camp from my camp it puts me at the visitor spawn
---
I’m disappointed in this sub that I am able to confirm that this is true and good advice
---
Is it sad that I have 3 gatling guns and nobody wants to buy a fuious one that I believe is 3 star or 2 star
---
I didn’t think anything that reduced armor applied to energy weapons?
---
This
---
It seems to just be players practicing with what prices are good and what aren't good for certain items. Since the vending is relatively new, there is no real market value for these kind of things since NPC vendors don't really give you anything.  I do agree though that some people are selling pretty common things for ridiculous prices.
---
The two times I found the tourist, it was in Whitesprings, on the hood of the car, outside of the entrance closest to the Fast Travel landing. Hope you get one soon! Grats on your backpack.
---
Yep my buildings are at an elevated landscape and the time it takes me to get up is enough for lvl68 super mutants to wreck shit.
---
Meanwhile visitors just spawn in front of the building.
---
I give them away all the time... but my goal is bring down the system
---
The prototype hazmat you get as a reward is level 1 and exactly the same as the level 50. The level are kinda meaningless.
---
I just have pretty much everything going for free or just really really cheap on my store. Don't really see a point in overpricing stuff I would've just given away or dropped anyway.
---
Yeah, it's really tedious for an item that doesn't give you very good bonuses
---
Yeah also it's just a pain on console to set a price with the scroller. Maybe on PC you can use the numpad.
---
Also ammo! I use to sell 5mm for 1c for 3 bullets but the vending machine doesn't make that easy.
---
I've seen it twice today.
---
And here i was thinking im just a bad raider with a good training post
---
I'll try.. I need it to.. i keep dying (non-revial) every time i touch water and die
---
Before I moved my base off the top of Seneca rock(decided to change the floor and the whole building became unusable) if you fast traveled to my base not in power armor you fell to your death half the time.
---
Dookiestorm is my gt
---
What kind of scary-ass reality do you live in where enemies spawn out of nowhere just because someone stepped on your lawn, and if they run away proceed to attack your house, prioritizing your garden?
---
Yep, more bugs that won't let you complete these quests.
---
They should not spawn in our camps but outside of them is fine bc the turrets can kill them
---
I’m on.
---
Sry i didnt say that well. The vendor gets more scripts every 20 hours. But you should still have ur total that youve sold from all the days before
---
I know I was confused and visited the areas in a strange order but at level 30 I had a camp down in the cranberry bog. I really wouldn't recommend visiting there but the mire is a bit more forgiving so that could be a good place to explore.
---
Any idea how to farm them ? Or how to get the blueprints ?
---
Xbox also experienced it last night
---
Yeah exactly this before the vendors people would just leave it in bags cases and registers for anyone. I also put some scrap that I won't use for free as well
---
Invited
---
Nah we have to use the arrow keys
---
I'm not able to find Strangler Bloom in the past 3-4 month. Before, during or after the event,  it dosent matter.
---
Not and excuse, but it is an explanation.
---
I would love to join in, too, but I will not be playing for a few more hours. I'm not getting my hopes up too high, though: the more people show up for the unlocking party, the higher the chances that someone will just grab the plan and switch servers, and sell it for 10k caps or more profit. :-(
---
I know **I** would be extra wary if I had the plans.
---
As for me, I might have better luck asking some of the 24/7 folks on my friends list if they have it. Trust is everything.
---
As an aside: has that even be confirmed as working that way? I know buying the upgrade unlocks it and gives you an extra plan for it, but from that doesn't follow that it will unlock for others by just holding the plans. That's the skeptic in me.
---
You don't get rid of it, someone else gets rid of it
---
I mostly just strip down to my undies and cry for help. Let someone kill you and give em some goodies in return. I notice a lot of people don’t bother but there’s always a few good people out there who will help you.
---
I tried to slightly move/adjust some objects underneath some stairs, but I was unable to place them again in roughly the exact same spot where I've had no problems to place them before.
---
Atomic shop
---
Thanks!
---
Got it done but thanks anyway
---
There was PC player who confirmed it three day ago. He said every of his friends have now inceased carry backpack from one plan.
---
I'm operating in what others have said. I'm studying and having spent a dozen hours on pioneer quests really would like this to be true so I can focus on the cosmetics. We will see. 
---
In terms of trust, I have a tse, sentinel armour, etc, that the other player is welcome to hold, or alternatively a trusted third party can get involved
---
Strip down to your skivvies, beg someone to kill you.
---
For added effect (and always a great laugh) only carry a couple raw fertilizer and maybe some toilet paper.  That when when you die it looks like you shit yourself.
---
Ah okay thanks!
---
It’s a plan drop from the Campfire Tales event that triggers at Camp Adams.
---
Maybe the concrete is used more of a tool in the process to make the razorgrain into a powder? I'm not sure. I don't like concrete in my food lol
---
Oh god....
---
what you do is go to your challenges (same place for weekly and daily's and then click world scroll down you will see possum / tadpole 
---
you need 8 possum badges to get high capacity for example
---
It's not just melee, this happens to my Gauss as well, been like this for a few patches, but seems to be getting worse ?
---
It also seems to be a bit server related, at least for VATS, i can be on a serve that i almost never hit anything with VATS, the serve hop and it's ok again, very strange...
---
I have the main entrances unlocked, but all the other doors is locked because I'm tired of people leaving the doors open all the time (It probably bothers me more than it should). I even locked the Nuka-Cola machine as well as the fireplace.
---
Really? I always assumed missile launchers in this game were weak.
---
You can buy them from the responders vendor bot. At least that's where I bought mines
---
I made some yesterday
---
I allways have to search the camp for the vending machines
---
Thanks, so do I. One of these days I'll devote some time to server hopping, but I quickly get bored of it after a couple of times and go do other stuff.
---
To fix this bes is going to award all sellers with a bulk sum of script. We can call this a wasteland class action payout due to price fixing lol.
---
Maybe because of new duping methods?
---
This is the answer. You don't need the new Campfire Tales tent. Any will do.
---
Yep!  I had an unbelievable amount of visitors to my camp.  It’s been nice!
---
It’s also a nice feeling watching the stash weight go down isn’t it?
---
From my store if you are on xbox
---
But where exact that  responders vendor bot ?
---
Kill super mutants and scorched. Mostly the former.
---
This happened to me as well. :( I’ve been locked out of my main account for day now.
---
Hopefully they do. If the game doesn't start to change I think I'll leave. And I don't mean immediate, but we need to start seeing gradual changes. Such as factions that people can join and make flags for, with that increased server capacity would be nice, by maybe 20-28 players (over time maybe). But then the likes of retaking things like Harper's ferry, have it become a hub with a cross server vendor so it's easier to sell things. 
---
Because you know, if we actually succeeded in taking out the SBQ then more people should arrive eventually.
---
The Handy who sells armor at the Whitespring. Forgot his name. The Hunting Lodge store, I’m pretty sure? The Brotherhood bot is there too.
---
its a level based pvp system, no skill just grind or some shit like that. 
---
cant really do anything if the level difference is huge
---
Gunned down by turrets while attacking a wall vs direct access to my benches
---
PC(
---
I'm having trouble suddenly that makes it impossible to get vats to allow a hit in melee. It goes green and just stays at 0 no matter where I move or stand with no obstacles. This is a bloodied Unyielding lvl 245 build with stats above 30 in most cases. Is it me?
---
Thanks I'll check later.
---
This. Batman uses the best gear, not some trash than expect to get results.
---
Repair kit only repairs to 100% don't it? So most likely just how it is lol
---
I've seen melons at the airport garden (just one, on the north-west side of the patch). Also, one of the viewpoint towers on the west edge of the Mire, I think, has a whole lot of edible plants, and I think melons were there too.
---
every time the amount shown has been the amount sold.
---
It has sulphur spring water. Drink it. Don't collect it.
---
Agreed! They’re pretty neat. If we could build them, perhaps each part would be its own piece, so they could be modular.
---
Happens on my regular PA melee build aswell.
---
I was under the impression you can't damage a camp unless both players attack each other?
---
I have a TSE pump for sale at my camp for a pretty reasonable price. Now I know why no one has bought it :/
---
Yknow what? Sure, I'll swing buy and buy a few things from your vending to show my support!
---
Are you on pc?
---
I am on 620hours right now. I still don't have all plans. So when i am bored i fast travel around camps looking for ones i don't have. Sadly people sell 20-30 plans usualy and i have them all.
---
I wish much love to those people who have over 100plans in theyr machines (for default price)
---
Turn on the perk that helps you find magazines (I dont want to embarrass myself by trying to spell it off the top of my head) a d just wander around. 
---
You'd be surprised how often you'll find them. 
---
I made like 5000 caps the first day of vendors off of them for 50-75 each.
---
It sounds like you just need to let go of some stuff. I’m level 157, have a nice CAMP with 20% budget remaining, 4 well stocked vending machines, have a low carry weight, non PA character and can manage just fine. I’d like to see an increase to stash and budget, but it’s hardly game breaking.
---
Holy cow :[ Thanks for the heads up.
---
then I build a house out of vending machines
---
Check the faction vendors in whitesprings.  I saw one of them had it.
---
mines infinitypt11. i also need the revive in water one!
---
Max out Hard Bargain, Party Boy and Strong Back for carrying more junk and higher selling prices.
---
Do loot runs where just run through a couple relatively easy locations/areas quickly picking up everything you can. Familiar areas are best cause you can plan your route according to where you can scrap your junk rather than walk around overencumbered, and you'll have memorized cap stashed, recipe/plan spots, pricy outfits, etc. Just do one of these runs a day until you're at Max carry weight, head back to camp, bulk what you don't need and farm some purified water, and you can max out a vendor every few days at least.
---
Doesn't matter, they can still put the armor on a suit and put it in their stash. If the armor is on the suit, they can't get in it, but it will still get recalled into their inventory after 60 seconds, then they can throw it in their stash.
---
IGN?
---
I've had more Server not respondings and DC'S or CTD's during last days. 
---
Silos are terrible, terminals are lagging badly and removing/inserting main frame cores has been a pain for me.
---
Division 2 recently came out (a bit under 2 months) and they did such an amazing job with that. Clan support out of the box, at launch. Matchmaking by activity type - just matchmake for whatever, matchmake for main missions, matchmake for bounties, matchmake for PvP. At any point you can also call for backup, another social option, AND you can open your group (by default you are in a 1-man group which is set to friends/guild only, but can be set to private or public), so people can hop in. And, of course, text chat, including zone chat. Meaning if you want to group for whatever, you always have a tool at your fingertips to group up, or find people to help with something very specific. That's what a modern multiplayer game should have.
---
Amen. Does the ever still give badges at random? I've done it a dozen times and yet to get one myself. Not complaining, just making sure I'm not expecting something that's not there anymore since patch
---
ingame name is Exovation
---
Sounds good, I'll join u and we can go to Solomon's pond. Does that complete the water revive or do I have to be fully submerged?
---
Marsupial players are on PEDs.
---
Oh so strip the armor, get in/out, put back on, then let it collect. Thanks I didn't know about this.
---
Agreed. I spend a ton of time opening the challenge menu and scrolling just to make sure I completed it.
---
Just stash your Decon shower and only take it out when you need it. Works for me
---
i believe it just has to touch water, no idea though
---
Yeah vats is bugged as hell for melee. I normally just step back a little, time it a little, center the target a little, then swing like a madman.
---
Bad ass
---
Thanks Bud, this helped alot 👍🏻💛
---
I'll team up and let's find out. Just don't take all my junk plz haha
---
I really wanted to take my time and he able to handle wherever I went without feeling underleveled. The Ash Heap was really easy at 30, besides the odd scorchbeast. Not a ton down there but plenty of marked locations to discover for easy XP.
---
I say price to sell.  I’ve listed my items because I don’t need them &amp; want other players to take advantage of them.  The caps are a nice bonus.
---
You damn genius. I'll have to do that if I ever get around to building a new one
---
Awesome! Stop on by!!
---
Is this correct? I didn't know that to be honest but I like killing everything. At my level I need any exp I can get. Levelling up is quite painful from 245 to 246 lol
---
My question would be, do buildings you instance into it (fort defiance, dmv) do you consider the space once you’re in or just the exterior?
---
Well I got from the town when you first enter free mode to the town in the bottom right corner of the map next to the penitentiary in about 30 minutes, and that's how long it usually takes for me to get from vault 76 to whitesprings which is in the center of the map. If u had to say, fallout 76 is a bigger map, but that's just my opinion
---
1700 hours
---
mind..blown🤯. Well kind sir. I mean exterior I guess
---
I usually ask if the wanted one wanted to get rid the wanted tag first. Shooting emote, then ok emote, wait a little, and if the wanted doesn't move, kill.
---
PC here. Thanks
---
I want it so bad too
---
I'm REALLY worried about this update.
---
25% to get badge
---
The armour effects only count towards the weapon and not the mods on the weapon so they'll never weigh zero if they're modded
---
Trust me it’s worth the extra effort
---
Translation, I figured it out watching YouTube videos now will I get banned lol
---
Clan support. Text chat. Allowing people to build closer. Basically look at No Man's Sky, The Division 2, Elder Scrolls Online, etc., they all have modern (within 5 years) multiplayer features.
---
Go to the Mothman Museum &amp; reload until there's a tourist infront of the Statue. Took me like 4 reloads on PC.
---
Follow up question: what is the difference in total map volume of a location ? How much larger is a space once you instance in versus it’s outside dimensions. I feel that FO76 is bigger than Red Dead.
---
You can get in to it during the lose bareing event. It just sever hop and reset the keys location.
---
Thank you very much, something to stew on. 🤔
---
im at solomons pond right now
---
I guess that Bethesda is trying to do something for everyone. Personally it’s not my thing, if I wanted battle royal I’d play one of the hundreds of titles specifically designed with that in mind. That’s just my personal preference though, I’m sure the are many many people that will absolutely love it,
---
Honestly, same. This makes me think fortnite kids n sh\*t will come over to Fo76 and I don't really condone that.
---
Open your pipboy,,
---
Go left to the stats screen
---
Go over in the menu you the right, you should see "collections"
---
This tells you cap totals, tadpole and possums badge totals, and legendary scrip.
---
Headed there now
---
Does Bethesda read the comments on this subreddit?
---
I wired the terminal on the inside use it to open the door. On the outside, you can punch the code in to open... Or close the door
---
Hopefully this will make you guys' wiring setups look less jacked.
---
Cheers
---
I have "Play Acoustic Guitar" completed for that, but yea, can't get any of the other ones to pop.
---
How is this relevant to the post?
---
Don’t buy your way through the game. Grind it out.
---
Sometimes I use words don’t fully understand to make myself sound more photosynthesis😂. That is to much brain work for a Sunday or my noob brain in general. Thanks though👏🏼
---
I crept up to the lake. Managed to take out the Mirelurk Queen that was there. Dunno if this is a normal spawn! Lol.
---
Just need to revive an ally now. And in water and I get my backpack. Lol.
---
Hey, at least it’s worth 40 scrip at the legendary scrappers
---
Not when all of the other players want to finish the event as quickly as possible.
---
For future reference I saw a post previously where someone placed a power armor frame in the fissure and jumped on to that to reach their bag. I have not tried it myself.
---
What are you talking about, is that even a thing that monsters spawn when other people come inside your border?
---
Xbox?  How much? I’m definitely looking for one right now
---
Yeah, we have enough to worry about and 10 year Olds screaming "LET'S GO" or Screaming in rage when they die don't need to be added to that
---
My mother used to tell me stories when I was growing up in the vault about a man only mentioned in hushed tones and surrounded by mystery. I used to believe her stories warning about him but as I grew older I stopped believing her thinking it was some kind of madness brought on by her living underground. She... she never liked the vault but knew it was her only salvation from the hellscape the surface had become. 
---
I was only 2 when the world ended Vault-Tec made an exception because my mother was a widow and had several doctorates in fusion energy. Sorry I'm staling a bit here let me get back on track, my mother used to warn everyone to lock their doors at night and close their windows those where her "two rules of survival" of course we don't have windows it's a vault, so everyone used to bully me about my weird mother. I was 15 when she died she developed some sort of degenerative brain disease from working in the generator room without proper protection, I.. I was with her when she passed she told me remember the two rules and that she loved me then she passed and I was alone.
---
It was hard, reclamation day eventually came and you know the rest the scorched, the giant bats, the mutated monsters and freaks that once where average everyday things twisted by a nuclear holocaust, but all those monsters are nothing compared to the man my mother warned me about all those years ago. His name is the Mad Crapper, they say the Mad Crapper stalks his victims at night wearing only a gimp mask and a pair of leather pants with an ass flap he has the ability to projectile shit up to 20 yards away with enough force to kill an man instantly. Sounds like a funny joke you would tell to your friend but no HE IS VERY MUCH REAL. My mother never told me about how my father died only that he was dead so I ventured to the Capital building to see If i could find a death certificate or home address or anything what I found was worse. I found newspapers and police reports about the night he died. 
---
My parents where in bed when the heard a noise of the front door slamming open they slept on the top floor so my mom got me out of my crib, I was only 3 months old at the time and my father got his shotgun, someone was inside the house. my father crept out of the room and started going down the stairs when my mother heard a loud guttural noise of neither man nor beast and with a loud boom my father was shot up the staircase and into the wall his body slumped down broken and defeated he looked over to my mother he was covered in some sort of dark liquid he told her to run. She started climbing out the second story window with me in her arms that's when she saw him. He was a tall lanky man over six feet tall with only a pair of leather pants and a gimp mask his eyes dark like obsidian he looked her straight in the eyes as he slowly turned his rear towards my father. My father kept screaming for her to go and as she made the jump with me into the bushes below  she heard one last guttural sound and a loud boom she ran to the neighbors house only to find the door was open and he was already dead on the ground covered in the same dark liquid the killers calling card. 
---
She ran down the street calling for help with me clutched in her arms she soon realized that the killer had already come for them all their doors were wide open. she started running toward the main road to town when she heard it, a loud guttural muffled scream it was the killer. She started running even faster towards the road hearing him behind screaming. as she got to the main road a car swerved almost hitting her. The car stopped and a man got out seeing a lady in a nightdress with a baby he asked what was wrong my mother immediately got inside his car and told him to get back inside and drive. He stopped and asked what the "hell is that" his eyes fixed on a point down the dimly lit road. It was the killer running on all fours screaming the man got back inside his car and drove to the police station. by the time time the police showed up the killer was gone. in a single night he killed an entire neighborhood me and my mother where the only survivors of the massacre. My mother moved in with her sister and didn't leave the house until the day the world ended and we went to the vault.
---
I was horrified by what I had found some crazed killer from before the war with some insane poop powers killed my father sounds like something you read in a bad story written by a child. I figured the killer was probably dead at this point though and I had nothing to fear but I was wrong.
---
It was about a year after the vault had opened and my buddy Steven the only friend I had was dead, some traders told me that they were doing food runs and showed up to his camp and found his door ripped off its hinges and Steven was in his bed his head blown apart and spread across the wall he was covered in some sort of dark goo with a horrendous smell. It was at that moment I knew the Mad Crapper was alive. The killings would happen every other Tuesday and sometimes Wednesday someones house was broken into and they were killed with the same liquid. One night I was making a trip back from the whitesprings and it was getting dark I was in my suit of t-51 with my trusty rifle in hand I was following the train tracks home when some super mutants jumped out of an old train car and attacked me. They were quite easy to take care of but now it was dark. I was walking further down the tracks the only light coming from my headlamp when I heard a noise a low growl I thought it was just some feral wanting to pick a fight. As I turned around I saw him a windigo standing over me with a shredded mask obscuring his rotted face I instantly knew this was the crapper. Mutated by the horrors of war and twisted into a vile monster me lunged on top of me knocking me back onto the ground and started clawing away into my armor. I gathered all my strength and pushed him off of me and grabbed for my rifle and fired several shots into him before he ran away. I got home safely and feel lucky to be alive but always remember lock your doors and lock your windows because THE MAD CRAPPER LIVES!!!
---
They have never been "worthless" to me. I have saved almost every plan/recipe I found since release because I knew player vending would eventually come. They are my best sellers
---
I sell most normal plans for 111 caps 
---
My fas'nacht plans go for 444 caps
---
My x01 and t51 unique paint plans go for 888.
---
My weapon plans vary in price.
---
The definitely sell.
---
Is that you Tom?
---
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on.
---
Fire axe
---
I named it N*gger beater. In game I have the "I" instead of "*"
---
yeah im waiting for them to fix this.. i moved my camp and wanted to rebuild my shop becouse it kept teleporting ppl in textures.. now i cant even build. Half walls are totaly impossible.
---
Oh my god. Kids wont play this game. It have nothing in common with fortnite.
---
Survival is some kind of battle royal too and there are no maily kids.
---
Many people wanted balanced pvp without legendaries. This could be one. I hope it is some kind of boss with crazy mechanics. We can't be sure how it will be.
---
Too bad you can’t rest a shotgun on your lap.
---
I remember one important thing that many did wrong in the beginning:
---
At level up, you have to pick first the special you want to raise and afterwards can choose any card, even from the other specials, by filtering (PC standard: Z/C)
---
It's been this way since 'beta' for me. I've been killed many time at WS and manongah by invisible enemies while my weapon hasn't even loaded in. My camp always takes a good minute or two to load in as well. It got a little better for a short time after the dupe delete wave but returned to normal fairly quickly.
---
I got a legendary ghoul attacking a wall at someone’s base. I’ll always take easy loot!
---
Fallout 76: 16 Square Miles           
---
RDR2: 29 Square Miles
---
He's right. It's about three stores down from the Artisan shop in Whitesprings. It's the shop that looks like a lodge.
---
i think the rumor why bethesda doesn't allow them in camps (they are in workshops), is because they thought that people would just use them to create death traps for people coming to visit.
---
the issue with this, though, is that you can find where the actual spawn for your camp is for other people (yours is apparently different.) by having a friend fast travel there a few times, and then you could create your death trap. people have actually already done this, it's not a new thing.
---
there really is no reason that the mats shouldn't be allowed in camps anymore.
---
When I finally do find them, they are normally bugged where you can see them but can’t pick them up.
---
Yes
---
Lmao exactly. People don't know shit.
---
I have about 1400 atoms, and nothing in the shop tickles my fancy. I'd love to just trade all of it for a  bit more space
---
Same for me yesterday.  I basically did nothing but Campfire for 10 hours and got 3 badges.
---
Build smarter. Build the right turrets in the right place and place your valuable objects behind barriers and turrets. Don't dumb it down for the rest of us.
---
I seem to just gather loads of them. Sold 66 of em to the vendor to get rid of some a few hours ago and I just got off than and I had 117.
---
Sup Bethesda.
---
Oh you got badges yesterday? I must be unlucky then :(
---
Even in the best case scenario why is data leaking that way?
---
I should never ever know how many of an item a person already has, only the amount they bought from me
---
I don't think that is true at all.  I am also only getting about a 1/3 of the caps I should from sales. The sale price pop ups are correct, the caps deposited are not.
---
Ohh Carlos why didn't you protect your camp with turrets...
---
some say take a picture (prosnap) others say take a picture in photomode (usually at a place not of a item/enemy)
---
Welch Station, kill all the miners  basically outside the station and pick up all their weapons. Getting over encumbered doesn't matter because the station is right there. Sell all weapons to the vendor. Leave server and repeat. This is my method anyway.
---
Another one is go to west tek research centre and then log out when you log back in, the mutants there and inside will be low level but will still use assault rifles and scattering laser rifles. They sell for a good bit.
---
Same here I'll always buy 10 at that price. I hardly ever get low but it's quicker than tick blood farming.
---
Did other things get duped? I bought bird bones serum for 2500, wasn’t sure if someone forgot a 0, if they’re being duped and don’t have as much value, or if I’m an idiot and that’s just what bird bones sells for
---
Seriously? Try Flatwoods. Vendors are at every train station. Responders are all the low level Forest areas. If they don't have it just server hop.
---
I get bloodied and instigating rippers pretty often, but only rippers.
---
Just the sirum? I sell that for 250 lol 2500 way too much
---
I never get assassins or vampires :( how many stars are you getting? I haven’t farmed wrestle before just whitesprings 
---
Is westek better?
---
Sorry the recipe lol I’ll edit
---
I can't even finish this damn event WHEN it spawn. I'm always alone and I always get the damn bugs waves and never have enough kindle to keep the fire burning.
---
That's a good deal for the recipe, I'd pay 5k for a recipe
---
It is. You're not. 10% tax. The caps are correct
---
If anything, they added on a zero.
---
If you run the Scorchbeast Queen often enough, you'll be sitting on a lot of Flux.  It's heavy and there isn't much to do with it other than make serums, so you can find those in player vending machines for relatively cheap.  I charge 450 Caps for mine.  Some go as low as 200.
---
&gt;Why do people have to spend all their time looking for exploits.... Just play the game man.
---
don't think they could ever get a legacy weapon no matter how long they played.
---

---
So..
---
When you go to garrahan and download the plans from that 1 terminal, they’re saved to your pipboy.
---
From there, Any power armor station you go to allows you the ability to craft excavator power armor pieces, arms legs, helmet and torso.
---
After you’ve crafted a complete excavator set, you have to go back and register your Excavator PA to create your own Power armor  station in camp.
---
AFAIK, dL the excavator plans to your pipboy and registering the armor let’s you create and level up your excavator PA.
---
Camp venture is the camp in the mire, the one with the master sergeant is camp mcllintlock
---
Well every man and his dog is going to have one now.
---
Its always the Brahmin...
---
I have loads of turrets in good locations. The only things to consistently be destroyed are one piece of fence and the Brahmin.
---
Very little cost associated, but it is aggrevating.
---
If you want assassins or vampires it seems to be that way, also I like west tek because I know the route and it’s hard to go off path as it’s all connected. 
---
White springs also has too many people usually for me.
---
I’m getting unlucky and only getting the level 48 mutants with legendaries so one star, but I just got a 3 star guitar sword assassins.
---
It’s a pretty good spot tbh.
---
I have legitly looted explosive cryolator, why you think it may should be imposibls
---
heres some screenshots of the upcoming quick play/match UI: https://imgur.com/a/9olccxM
---
Scripted so many 20 pound  legendaries day one!
---
There’s a certain quest in the mire about a weakened protectron. IF DOING THAT QUEST, could also meet revive an ally that could help out other solo players..
---
Datamines indicate there’ll be the corpse of the guy leaving these messages in place of a third eventually, but it isn’t in game yet.
---
I need to do the same too..! Add me x-Duncan-Idaho-x (I’m overwncumbered you come to me..?)
---
as opposed to a small minority hoarding them for ludicrous prices?
---
don't know which one is worse, really.
---
Thanks !
---
!
---
I just need a bloodied power fist and I’ll be good. But nope, everything I get is deal 15% more damage to robots or some garbage.
---
What I ended up doing was creating a "Freebies" machine at my CAMP for the stuff I used to put in the Watoga Station suitcase.  Everything in that machine costs 0 Caps.
---
This way, it's not going to despawn or anything.
---
Is that the ultracite skin?
---
I've already played with 9/12 y olds who play the game. I just sorta feel like it'll bring more. Not saying it's the worst thing I just don't want brats. y'know, the little kids who think they're better because they play online pvp games mostly.
---
I asked that earlier and I think they thought I was joking.
---
Ahh many thanks, must admit never thought of that, I will check.
---
Same here but not really out if laziness. Any time I get near max caps I go there and buy 4. Always keeps me between 6- 10 cores.
---
Yeah, this really sucks. I’d also ask that maybe CAMPs can just negate spawn points entirely, because I’m really sick of finding out I built my camp on an enemy spawn and getting fucking attacked every time I log in. It’s a serious resource drain nowadays because they spawn constantly thanks to player vending.
---
it hasn't been possible for the longest time now.
---
I can't find any answers either about it?
---
Yeah, have a little bar and I was wanting to sell drinks for a couple of caps.
---
No u dont have to repric (ps4) had a douche come. Reak all my. Vendors and shower. HB we fix the you cant hurt me armour because its trash for trash people.
---
Great thanks again
---
The fact that there are standing static structures in the game is enough evidence that the mobs should not be prioritizing attacks on our bases. By that logic there should be no houses, standing crops, or Brahmin alive.
---
From what I understand, neither actually works.
---
lets do this please i'll be on in 15 minutes...... mattola69
---
There are people with 600played hours. Some have over 1500hours. So um why should be that imposible again?
---
Honestly? As long as the other two vaults are strictly PVE and that there isn't massive things locked behind the PVP I don't mind too much. Just something I won't be doing like survival I guess.
---
Added!
---
Add the duping and hackers and there's a big no-no from me. I have over 500 hours into the game since BETA but i only joined survival servers for a couple of times and gave up on it. It's fun but i can't take it seriously with all the shitty stuff going around.
---
Radshield, like Dense mods, has become one of those "WTF is this so rare?" items.  The hassle of finding them doesn't seem commensurate with what they do.
---
If you build a new set of regular stairs down to a whole new foundation on the ground, it will let you remove the 2x1s. Deleted my entire base 8 or 9 times before I figured that one out.
---
A item of that quality should not have been limited timed
---
I assume it’s rounded. So for one cap, you’d get the whole cap. For 8 caps, you’d get 7.
---
To visit somebody’s camp there has to be a green tent marker and you can pay caps to go there wether you’re friends or not
---
I visited someone's camp today to find it under siege by multiple scorchbeasts, one of which was level 80! I didn't know they could attack in groups. I didn't even know enemies could be level 80! I took out a few foot soldiers and fled.
---
the word "legacy" implies that the item is not in the game anymore. so someone who started playing after the patch could never get one no matter how many hours they played.
---
I moved to a low traffic area, I get the occasional mongrel but my camp never gets destroyed. I keep my heavy  turrets on roof and life is good.
---
Good luck to you!
---
Yeah but we got it before patch?
---
Are you on PC? I might have a buyer for you.
---
Yes, let's downvote a guy who is not afraid to speak the truth. Wake up roseys, look at the huge bugs lists that are kept here on reddit.
---
No, I'm on ps4
---
can't find this shack? im east and across the river near delano grange farm
---
You should check out the upcoming stuff from the Atomic shop and see for yourself if you should spend or not your atoms on the Black Rider! 4 Excavator Skins will be added, and the Pale Rider will be released in a few days.
---
They should fix the spotlight thing and the turrets, the spotting is clearly bugged and won't work on half of the times, and in the mean while NPC turrets work perfectly to against players for somehow
---
then it doesn't apply to you? obviously.
---
I buy plans if they are priced 100 caps!
---
Mirelurk kings' attacks probably,
---
Or make a safe area around camps so enemies can only come so close
---
You can only make 4 but that’s all you need for your walls XP
---
Can we just remove the entire camp attack mechanic? It's annoying and doesn't accomplish anything. I'm so sick of loading into a world at my camp to hear it under attack before it's even loaded in, by enemies that I can't see or fight for for a full 20 seconds.
---
Just made that mistake myself after collecting everything but the radroach meat..
---
Oh well... Maybe time for discount pricing! I saw a shop where every item price ended in 99. 
---
"This beautiful Furious Gattling Gun can now be yours for as little as 1199 caps"
---
Lmao I sell all my fas’nacht plans for 15 caps apiece
---
I know for ammo it’s pretty broken at the moment. If you’re selling lots of ammo at just one cap each, say 2000 at 1c each, you don’t get 2000c. Or even 1800c. You get closer to 36c or something like that. So it seems prices under 10c will need to be reworked
---
I never thought of them as worthless. Just up until Player Vendoring we had no way of really dealing with them en masse. 
---
I collect and hoard plans. Always have since release of this game. I gave away any plan I already knew because what was the point of keeping them? Once Player Vendoring showed up on the radar I started to stash what I considered to be the harder to get or rare plans. When Patch 9 went live, I had 327 pounds worth of plans sitting on a mule waiting to be vendored. In the few days this patch has been live, I regularly clear 20K+ caps a day and I don't have a single plan listed over 1k caps. If you have never experienced the pain of farming for that ONE plan you need, dropping 500-1000 caps to snatch it up and get on with your day is a glorious thing.
---
Need help packing? I think we can scout out some new locations for your camp XP
---
Slow = Twohanded, Fast/Medium = Onehanded.
---
I agree, there should be a mode in which every region has mobs for level 50+ players. Low level regions are fun to explore but the mobs are boring.
---
Sell them for what you want, mine happen to be selling at 444 caps A piece.
---
 You should charge more since you won't be able to get them until next year's event. Lots of people never got to do the event so they don't have the plans.  They actually sell a lot more frequently than my other plans.
---
 But if you want to sell yours for 15 apiece have at it.
---
Uh I use Blades Knuckles and those penetrating ones. The Instigating Boxing Glove has been working out great at (at most) 3-4 hit killing even Super Mutants that are level 22 at my low level
---
Doesn't really scream battle royale.
---
Maybe you're confusing it for deathmatch which was mentioned way back in the noclip documentary.
---
Bethesda are hilariously inept
---
I personnaly now wait when I die at the  sheepsquatch event, so people can have the time to revive me if needed :)
---
Also, if you look at your map and see someone stood in a random spot (like the middle of a field or next to the river) and they haven’t moved for 10 minutes, odds are that’s where there camp is lol.
---
Really?
---
No it isn't, OP supplied a video showing how much ammo he had for sale and how much he had it listed for then had someone buy some, showrd the amount bought and the total caps he got was only 1/3 what it should have been.
---
Are the stimpaks diluted or super?
---
Already been through that and it sucks.
---
I don't think that one is actually Small Letters.  Yes, Small Letters looks like that, but this is the selection of premade signs like AMMO.  I know I had these before I had Small Letters, but I don't know what this plan is called.
---
Oh yeah people always buy them; I have stacks left over from grinding the event. 
---
I could care less about making caps off other players; it’s just a nice way to “give” them away without having to worry about dropping them; newer players want balloons too
---
Most of the time slow = 2handed, fast/medium = 1handed. There are exceptions to this thought. If unsure use perk cards to see if damage goes up or down to determine if it is 1 or 2 handed.
---
Jesus stop making such helpful videos no but seriously awesome thank you
---
Where is that? On the market? Or player vendor?
---
All dupers do is make a quick profit for real money and caps then make everything worthless. It’s like counterfeit money, you print a bunch and enjoy the lifestyle for a while then when it’s worthless you move on to wreck other games. People steal toilet paper from public restrooms, I don’t blame them, any time a system can be taken advantage of, someone will. It’s a real shame that Bethesda can’t do anything about it when their product is being abused.
---
It's called small letters and signs I think
---
Yeah....and the OP cavecrickets
---
The guy you're responding to is unfortunately wrong. The video OP posted shows that he is only getting 1/3 caps he should be getting for ammo and even stimpacks.
---
Still faster than doing challenges.
---
Word.
---
Every time I’m building my camp and if I look at my pipbiy enemies spawn in my camp or start walking to it
---
Did you nearly throw your controller/ mouse at the TV/ monitor?
---
Yes same here. I have ridiculous amounts from the amount of times I did the event trying to get a rare masks.
---
 Which of course I never actually got one lol.
---
 My 444 caps Is taking in account the million times I had to listen to that dreadful music I couldn't get out of my head for days.
---
No just ordinary ones, I took all the others out of my inventory.
---
The bears are rough. The two hit stagger is constant with them.
---
I don't get them. Most of us bought the game because we love Fallout universe. Who the hell buys this game for PvP when there are a LOT of games that do a better job at PvP?
---
So..private servers and mods? I'd buy the game if I could mod it, but Bethesda couldn't balance a scale.
---
😊 Thank you!
---
Then they shouldn't have pushed so hard that you could play it however you wanted be it solo or in groups. Not to mention how are you supposed to play multiplayer when you can't even communicate with people outside of a handful of emotes, or hope they have the text chat mod?
---
It's unfortunate but happens often. I typically wait before moving into an area of whitesprings if I see people nearby. Too many times I've walked up to the resort and someone was already there, already killing the things I spawned (and likely spawns from other users)
---
I'm not sure you understand what you are trying to argue
---
Crossing my fingers on my 10,000 cap perfectly preserved pie.
---
How? I tried using the emotes to get people to help with the revive ally in water, but they just were confused. Also couldn't find anyone running the text chat mod to communicate with.
---
It blows my mind that I can come to this sub daily and can count on someone coming up with a new, fresh, lucid suggestion. This is more gold, take my upvote :)
---
You must have accidentally destroyed something which would have allowed the pvp to take place.
---
   If not, then you were playing on the pvp server.
---
I pretty much just ask for 10 caps for a plan that I know, to me it’s just free caps that I wasn’t getting before player vending.
---
How? Ive tried every combo lf emotes and no one understood.
---
i gave up on server hopping and ended up just biting the bullet and spending caps to FT to all of the spawn spots on 1 server..
---
I finally go it at col. kelly monument.. GL
---
Seems like most people wandering the wasteland were born in a barn. I locks what I want and unlocks what I want. Learn to wipe your feet and shut the door behind you, maybe more doors would be open to you.
---
How are you supposed to do that with just emotes?
---
Fucking bugs have always been like this in fallout some of the worst damn enemies. At least there nowhere near as bad as in new Vegas
---
Yeah i know them cazadors very well
---
I passed on buying a 3 star instigating handmade for 2.5k because I couldn't see its other modifiers :(
---
 Still have nightmares bout them damn things
---
LOL You are quite welcome! I'm working on a Royal Jelly one right now. With (hopefully) three locations you can use in crafting. Not the junk jelly.
---
I have all my plans set at 0 caps the. Singular pieces of coal priced at increments of 100 so if someone wants to leave a tip they can. If someone doesn’t have the caps they can have them for free if someone gets a plan they have wanted for ages they might buy a piece of coal for 500 caps aswell. Bit of a pay what you want system I guess
---
But it is nearly impossible to communicate what you are trying to do with just emotes.
---
Ok thanks and noted but are you saying that provided I am playing on adventure and do not attack anyone I cannot be killed by PvP?
---
Yeah.  My favorite was the Radrat that acted like a Sentry Bot.  But yesterday, I came across a Colonel Gutsy that had the Robo-Brains Tesla Rifle weapon instead of its normal gun.  That thing was surprisingly brutal (I suppose it must fire it a *lot* faster than the Robo-Brain does), and even though it killed me, I went around thinking about how cool it would be if these sporadic little "hybrids" were a formalized thing.
---
How did you manage to explain it to them with the emotes?
---
It's part of the pioneer scout quests to get a backpack.
---
Bought the camo skin when it came out, just before the blackhawk, which I then could not afford.  I got the black rider skin this time.  I'm short on atom, so next up should be the best one ever.
---
I've considered putting them in a vending machine for free but i'm worried some level 300 will come along and scoop them up to sell them on for profit. I just carry them around as before and when I see a low level near vault 76 or the Overseers camp I give them to that person. At least that way I can choose who gets them and stop them wasting caps buying plans for some exorbitant fee.
---
Add me lncubl (it’s just incubi but with L’s ) I actually just started playing this game I’m only level 15 currently and I’ve never even followed any news about this game until I started a week ago so I know nothing but I like exploring
---
If they hadn’t “allegedly” nerfed Watoga that would be another location for people to farm. Now it’s useless to go there as no legendaries no more.  Uranium Fever isn’t much better. 
---
Whitesprings is really the only place now.
---
Well, I mean...the shooting sucks. Crafting is tedious. Enemies are brain dead bullet sponges. Quests are low effort fetch and kill. The game stutters and lags everywhere, completely lacks RPG elements Fallout fans love, cant be modded and mostly consists of searching for screws because weapon durability is a bad joke.
---
But sure. Its fine.
---
Ha, everything in my camp is pretty cheap, but I've got one perfect pie set at 8008...no particular reason. Hoping someone comes along with more dollars than sense!
---
Kind of sad that a perfectly good Vault would be wasted on PvP nonsense.
---
He's just a simple man trying to make his way in the universe.
---
I don't get why he said, that it is imposible for people to have legacy weapons. Did i miss something? O.o
---
This. Dupers try to justify their illegal profit by saying they brought people to play the game. It’s completely the opposite. People buy a duped god tier weapon play a few days then there’s no more reason to play it since they got what they grind for. A rare mask is supposed to be rare so people play hard to earn it. Now just a quick purchase everyone is wearing it without playing the event, then within days immediately nobody will be wearing it because it’s just dumb to look the same as others. Dupers kill the game.
---
It doesn't anymore. It really doesn't.
---
I have literally never been stalked by Mothman in my 150 hours of this game. Not once.
---
I like plans so I can craft for friends. Mods are too random. Look to your player vendors on multiple servers and buy them. 
---
The high end plans are typically in high level areas. The vendors at Whitespring carry a variety as well.
---
that was great thank you
---
Thank you so much!
---
Exactly. So long as you don’t attack, or destroy someone’s property, you’re fine.
---
If someone is destroying your property and you don’t want to pvp, the only Defense is to server hop.
---
Or possibly a...*bug*
---
When rare things are no longer rare or difficult to obtain it breaks motivation, drive, and excitment in getting them.
---
They are responding to reddit partialy. Many people here wanted some pvp servers without legendary weapons etc. 
---
Also BR is trendy. If they make new different content, they may pull new kind of players.
---
The vendors seem to be busted right now and are taking way more than the 10% people are only getting like 1/3 the caps they are supposed to. So for now id recommend not using the personal vendors until they fix this bug.
---
The shooting in FO76 is crap. Its REALLY bad, compared to any other modern shooter. Weapons do very little damage, some use "distant" sounds in first person, recoil is all over the place and disproportionate to stopping power...
---
Shooting in FO 76 is a disaster.
---
They never said you could do *everything*.
---
Now that you mention it, it *does* feel like every terminal I’ve seen is level 0, 1, or 3
---
I see what you did. Too bad 10k is the cap, otherwise I would say make it 80085!
---
I'd rather not have that since canonically I've never nuked it nor would my character do that. In-universe it's incredibly dumb to nuke the safest place in the wasteland.
---
Anyone else not able to get more then 0% in VATS against a blood bug while wielding a melee weapon?
---
...they can tell who dupes anyway
---
Fuck yes. I sold my old Furious Minigun and Furious Gatling Gun yesterday, and was astounded at the room I gained.
---
I was at harpers ferry. I think I should have phrased my question as "is this item a plan for armor, or a plan for a mod for armor?"
---
Basically can I craft heavy combat arms, or will I have to find/unlock combat arms, and then I can apply heavy comabt arms as a mod
---
Found one like that the other day, poor fella didn't count on the fact that I was trying to rack up some crossbow kills, though.
---
Just wait till they start resource boosters and gear
---
It’s a plan
---
Ok, so Light, Sturdy and Heavy are "Types," so Heavy Leather, Sturdy Leather or Light Leather which are craftable at a workbench (Look for Light, Sturdy or Heavy Amour Options).
---
Leather, Robot, Combat, (blah, blah) are "Materials" and depending on the material, can have different Types (Leather can be Light, Sturdy or Heavy, Marine is only Sturdy, etc).
---
Hope that helps clear things up.
---
As long as Nuclear Winter has more than this battle royale mode I really don't mind it.
---
BGS probably mixed up their corporate income reporting software with FO76 software, let the IRS find the bug :D
---
No the next one is T-51 with a blue reskin and a symbol on the chest, really boring tbh
---
Atlas observatory, robotics control. Watoga antiques, manager terminal. I think...
---
Congrats, anything that’s explosive with multiplying effects (pellets) AND quadruple ammo is god roll 👍
---
Love this! I had someone help me a little when I was level 20, and now I try to help others out. My CAMP is always open, my farm is open to anyone and I will always try to give what peopel need (Unless im in need myself)
---
Todd Howard did at the E3 trailer. He said the game was designed as an online game but could be played 100% solo..
---
What should they prioritize then when then arrive at your camp?
---
Gurluas how do you get that enclave tag?
---
I fight for the user
---
Thanks for that, I thought I read a recent patch stopped a CAMP from receiving damage whilst  in adventure mode ..
---
Was the same for me this time yesterday, tried again about 12 hours later and could get in. Must have been their closing time :p
---
Nice thank you maybe also do a video on the parts that can’t be done right now that way people wouldn’t waste there time
---
Send them a message. If someone else needs it, they're most likely up to do it for you if you for them.
---
You can call me.. Robin Dookiehood
---
How do you send a message on PC?
---
I managed to get the ones for crafting instruments, none of the "play" ones have worked for me so far.
---
I can make you one for free, on psn I'm picklednarwhals
---
Think i have a Snallygaster spit explosion in my miscellaneous just laying around that i might just do with this
---
I’ve still had this bug and I scan and repair after each patch.
---
I dont think so.  They can tell who has duped items, though.
---
Long live Clyde. He was a good man. Thanks for your service.
---
If you want to have more offense you absolutely have to drop perks like strong back to make room for other perks such as Barbarian, gladiator and incisor to name a few. You’ll want to run both gladiator and incisor to improve damage and just overall offense. Also use perks like barbarian (as I’m assuming your strength is high) to improve defense as well.
---
yeah vending has actually had a negative affect on my stash stuff. I thought "hey I know a lot of PA mods I can mod PA parts and sell them" except frames are 10lbs in Stash or Inventory, if I pull all the parts off and sell them they take up like 160-180. oof.
---
If he had actually shown the ammo in his inventory before and after, except he didn't.
---
He probably had ~2000 for sale while the buyer had ~5000 on him. The bug makes it so that it doesn't show how many you actually sell, but rather how many are now in the buyer's inventory. 
---
I noticed this when I was notified that I "sold" over 2000 5.56 rounds when I know I only had 1000 for sale.
---
He didn't know my gun was loaded, and I'm so sorry my friend..... He didn't know my gun was loaded and he'll never ever do it again.
---
Rifleman/ Commando/ Melee
---
Anything that has been nerfed is still plenty good
---
It was never that way to begin with. If you mean you didn’t get the option to tame, you had a bug, if you mean it just wasn’t working, it’s not a guaranteed taming chance. Max level is 75%.
---
I went through atlas but didn't find any level 2 but I will try again.  And I'll hit Watoga antiques.  Thank ya.
---
Yeah since this update I come back to my crops all being destroyed constantly now.
---
1200 hours...
---
Think that was a Tron reference
---
Here is a great tool someone made where you can try combinations to see how weapons are impacted https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
 Entrapment was illegal I thought? At least it seems questionable.
---
* the action of tricking someone into committing a crime in order to secure their prosecution.
---
That's actually not a bad idea
---
Is that Nick Valentine’s voice? Can’t recall the actor, but it sounds like him.
---
Absolutely worse lag now for me too, with more frequent crashes and server disconnects as well. Before the patch, it was several weeks since my last server disconnect. This morning it happened less than a minute after I joined the world.
---
I have started to play on survival as they have completely ruined adventure,  running away and camping in your house covered in turrets is the new thing ,and yes it is a cowardly tactic .if you dont want to fight go back to adventure
---
False.  They are fun regardless of rarity.
---
Don't suppose you could provide a link? Tried searching without any luck...
---
That’s just a visual bug and you’ll get the proper 90%
---
Anything in the air is an auto 0% right now, awful
---
Thanks so tempted to rebuild my character for this god roll weapon
---
Huzzah!
---
Happy to hear it :)
---
Hop around to the train stations. You’ll find a tent plan from a vendor pretty quickly.
---
That sucks. :(
---
There's a shotgun skin in the atomic shop??
---
The blackish powder things on the floor of the Helvetia Church?
---
Not a clue, but at least I seem to know what you're talking about.
---
Exactly!
---
If you're on PC I wouldn't mind a couple I started a new character after the event so don't have any for that one
---
Don’t they aggro WS Robots?
---
I mean it's safe now but check in the dumpsters tell me if you still feel safe then.
---
Cave Crickets and higher-level Mirelurks are the bane of my existence. When they come around I just start dumping grenades on the area.
---
I've heard Med-X is supposed to ease the pains of poison damage, but that was a little while ago and it was based off assumptions from Fallout 4 so I couldn't say if that's accurate or not.
---
Wait...what level are you?
---
If you are surprised at how efficient ent you are at killing level 22 Super Mutants, you probably shouldn't be trying to fight anyone in survival yet. 
---
Being low level does excuse the shittier gear though. Even Batman started somewhere. 
---
By the way, my last Fallout 4 character was Batman. It was pretty fun.
---
Alrighty!
---
It's a flair. You can set it on the sidebar.
---
Actually, i’m Looking for something different than i’ve Played before. Maybe melee but not sure about that.
---
Legendary Goalie Stick! 99 DPS and bonus freeze damage. I'll name mine Ron Hextall.
---
You can still tame deathclaws. I just tamed the one on Deathclaw island with Wasteland Wanderer level 2
---
Thanks! And the Nukashine instruments worked for me, so I guess its inconsistently broken.
---
Collections tab in Status. If it shows zero it will update for the correct number next time you scrap a legendary. Same thing happened to me.
---
I don't kill myself multiple times an hour anymore but I feel powerless not being able to kill things fast anymore. It's disappointing as hell
---
Yeah.  I just got the Wetsuit yesterday.
---
You can craft them
---
Weapon: assaultron blade
---
And photo is of genertor, any generator in camp, just stand really close.
---
Lol why get your pantys in a wad ?
---
Just wait for it to come out and play it or dont. 
---
I for o e never played survival but a BR could work since there are sooooo many difrent weapons in the game
---
Vats build, pretty OP honestly
---
I only lost 40 but what can you do? There seems to be issues in this game on a daily basis.
---
Melee with deathclaw gauntlet is a killer, I recommend Bloodied, and running low health with unyielding
---
That would probably be abused if it was a pop up notification of some sorys
---
Don't cook blindly either.
---
not for everyone. the vast majority of people locked legendaries in Fo4 for example.
---
Aww sorry mate I’m on PS4 or I would; have you checked the fallout trading sub? Im sure someone there has them.
---
To be fair you are a lvl 6 and the person is lvl 65. So in some cases you wouldn't have stood a chance. Fast travelling away from a super unfair fight is understandable.
---
You’re probably best off looking for some anti-armor Fire rate stuff and bolstering if you’re looking to avoid any future nerfs to your gear because I don’t see those getting reduced soon
---
Gone, but not forgotten, or gone, as it turns out he just went on a spring run, he will return
---
I just message the owner and negotiate. Did this yesterday to talk someone down on a ton of bulk adhesive. But yeah, would be nice if we had an in-game option to do this
---
You shouldn't need to server hop anymore..
---
Challenges* Xbox achievements are bugged too though lmao
---
You're ignoring the sale of 25 stimpacks at 25 caps each only giving him 225 caps.
---
You have three locations for royal jelly on the map. I have not been able to find the one between becker farm and twin pine cabins. If it does exist can you please be a little more specific?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
No worries and it's my mission to never go to that sub ʘ‿ʘ
---
I had this the other day. Try server hopping, this fixed it for me
---
Once a person is logged off, their camp goes too. You both have to be on the same server - online at the same time.
---
 Not a bad idea!
---
Lmao why’s that? I’ve never used it myself; people expect way too much for goodies?
---
I believe that any combination of perk cards and legendary perks will cap weight reduction at 90%.
---
Happened to me a few days ago on xbox one I had to unplug my router for a few minutes then it worked.
---
Not big on using melee as a main weapon, but to me that sounds like it would be better suited as a backup weapon for a long-range gun rather than your primary melee weapon - the bonus swing speed and executioner effect could work very nicely as a finisher if an enemy gets too close for a sniper, for instance.
---
I've experienced lately when someone goes down, it just shows their name and no option to revive, I just thought maybe it was a player not opting to "ask for help" but maybe there's a glitch?
---
What specifically are you talking about?
---
I totally understood what you're saying, but surely if I wanted to play a BR, I'd play pubg or fortnite.
---
Nobody that plays fallout because they love fallout is going to want a BR. nobody would complain that they didn't have a fallout BR.
---
Melee hits are really buggy right now
---
I even went downstairs and unlocked the power terminal, but it had no option to power the equipment. Pc
---
And some kind of quest too
---
Yeah if you actually go to the machine it shows the correct amount where caps would normally be in the trade window
---
I got two in the same day, which were the first two I’ve ever gotten. I think I’ve peaked at this point.
---
The weapon one being most useful as it effects gear that don't have a respective perk, but the food/chems one is also good as that is two perk cards at once!
---
I don't see any stimpacks being sold, but I could just be missing it. How many seconds into the video are those sold?
---
That, I couldn't tell you. I'm a console pleb.
---
This was a serious question? Did you/do you not read anything that they update?
---
Yes, but it's not the best spot. NAR Repair Yard and the train wagon between there and Watoga Station are way more reliable spawns.
---
Damn I would love to come across a player made vendor town! Nice one
---
I had the same issue yesterday sounds like a bug (PS4)
---
Luck level: over 9000.
---
Yes, I always love it when I come home and on the other side of the lake where my camp is set up are 3 Super Mutants  or Scorched shooting at my crops, walls and water purifiers for quite a while and I have to repair that.
---
I think it's been changed that if you super duper die with huge damage you can't revive eg: throwing a grenade at your feet.
---
Try and get enemy to kill them instead
---
Time to come back.
---
This was a great ride.
---
Patch 9 added a new algorithim to detect people who bought it at launch and then never played, was nice knowing you!
---
Not part of the video, another comment in here happening to others as well. Not just the OP.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Go buy it in one of the whitespring vendors.. I forget which one carries it (maybe the one with bear skin rug?), but it rotates out. It may take some server hops.
---
And it can be. At launch.
---
I went to a camp yesterday and the owner did the “follow me” and as soon as I crossed the camp we were attacked by a level 60 scorchbeast. We took it down together but the way it spawned made it look like I was led into a trap hit it was totally random
---
What’s your PSN
---
You can't message them on the PC. That is the problem, and why I'm trying to figure out how to communicate with the emote wheel.
---
In a small voice “plus tax”
---
Lol what console are you on
---
No longer drops
---
That's the first step to becoming a mole miner
---
Cheers guys. Appreciated.
---
He'll taste my bayonet just like the prize bot and insult bot do
---
No it can't you can't solo "revive an ally". Everything else can be soloed in the game. That is the issue, if they are going to advertise that the game can be played solo 100% then they shouldn't add in things that are impossible to do solo.
---
Cheers man.
---
Xbox, Fallout Nerd101, and I'm online right now!
---
It's the second time I pick up the royal jelly  one near the vault 76 and it keep saying I have 2 on me!!! Fucking annoying
---
I’ve got a 25k comrade chubs
---
Yup. Someone suggested server hopping so I’ll give it a shot. Bad luck man.
---
Also, make sure you aren't in power armor
---
Oh, i see. I will go and take a look! I'm playing on PS4 dont know if it's same as Xbox? 🙈 I'm fairly new to the game &amp; PS4 aswell.
---
Same, SUPER ANNOYING.
---
Stephen Russell did indeed voice Nick Valentine as well as the Handys in Fallout 3, 4, and 76.
---
Bethesda seems to really like his voice work, as he was also the voice of Mercer Frey (and quite a few other voices) in Skyrim, Corvo Attano in Dishonored 2, and Dr. Sylvain Bellamy in Prey (2017).
---
Whats wrong with it? He enjoys the game. Good for him i would say.
---
I am server hoping few hours checking players vending machines and didn't meet any duped content. Economy is not hitted so hard :D
---
Forgive my ignorance, I’m not very knowledgeable on other countries taxes and what not but what is Denmark doing?
---
The one in the NorthWest? It's lying on the road under a skeleton that was riding a bike. The map is *pretty* precise so you should be able to pinpoint on your map with a marker
---
Vending machines can still be used when powered off
---
Hey is it possible to make one with all the locked terminals? I'm finding the Tadpole Codebreaker challenge to be quite difficult.
---
That’s unhealthy. I absolutely no life this game and I’m only close to half that
---
Up to 56% percent taxes
---
Holy crap
---
I get so confused when i try to set prices that i haven't put up a legendary yet.
---
They built a basketball court. They seem to be enjoying the game and having fun
---
Now just imagine you made it through the new Campside Fire Tales event, collected 30 or more bloodbug proboscis and tick blood sacs, think to yourself, 'I'm gonna stash these and be prepared for the whole week!', then five minutes later you come across a workbench and &lt;scrap all&gt; out of habit, half-awake see, 'Oh, 40 units of acid, nice,' to be followed by, 'Oh noooo!'
---
I got every camera pic except coal. And of course, it was the 2nd to last thing left for me to do :(
---
Oh yeah those unobtainable items are fun! Yesterday I saw somebody who was selling a behemoth's "thrown piece of rock" or something for 25k.
---
Yup, Indeed
---
This. If you would have junked it anyway, there's not much of an issue. You're up caps and down weight!
---
Dude I’m sorry man
---
Id like to see another round of bans is what id like to see..
---
the "market and economy" will recover with time..
---
prices were way too high anyway..
---
go to ebay and look at sold listings of FO76 items and blame those fools...
---
I love your videos dude. Thanks.
---
He said it was impossible to find them in game now. Not that they never dropped.
---
Nice I'm currently at church I'll add you when I get home or you can add me 
---
Jacob Rules 15
---
Not a tank by any means but I go with stealth on my main character. You can basically walk right up to just about any enemy and stand right on top of it without then even seeing you. 
---
Chameleon armor (1 or 2 pieces), the one unique combat chest that helps sneak, all shadowed, and muffled on the legs. Nobody ever sees you coming. 
---
For another character I also do Mysterious Savior and Life Saver armor. It's pretty funny how often you'll die and just stand right back up.
---
I've not come across any obviously duplicated type items either, finding Duped must also be RNG dependent.
---
Mine is the apposite, loading in is fast and much MUCH better then before the update. I haven't experienced any noticeable lag other then the area I know about have weird stutters, etc but nothing got worst for me just better.
---
I’m in many trader groups, I’ve seen AAE Handmades sell for caps, people who had little before now have 2/3 explosive Tesla’s 
---
People have been selling trade only stuff for caps
---
Massive increase of legacy items added to the game
---
Basically, there needs to be a before and after of both caps and inventory to verify that this isn't just a visual bug.
---
Because all I'm seeing is GT bought [item] [quantity] 
---
However, I can attest to the fact that the [quantity] is not always how many were sold, but rather how many are now in the buyer's inventory.
---
Buyer walks up to vending machine with 15 stimpacks, buyer purchases 5 stimpacks, vendor is notified that Buyer bought Stimpacks (20) 
---
If someone can show this with a before and after of their inventory it would be credible. But I've yet to see that.
---
Mine might end up similar to that because the area around my extractor is so uneven. Right now it’s 3 foundations that don’t link up how I want them. Although, seeing so many camps gave me an idea to make parts more like sheds.
---
I didn't make that name btw my wife did
---
I'll be honest it sounds much more like Deathmatch/TDM which they said would be a feature. Especially the "Winning as a collective sounds like communism line".
---
If it is BR, I doubt it'll be played much unless it's exceptional (and or a load of people from Fortnite are like it's fortnite but Fallout and buy the game). Regardless I doubt it's much to be worried about, if you don't like PvP don't interact with it? I'm sure there are enough people for PvP to play it, and they'll be happy and you can keep playing adventure/survival.
---
They removed the drop from the game you can keep your old ones but cant get new ones
---
good.. prices are/were way too high anyway..
---
also.. lol @ all the 3 star lead pipes about to enter the economy...
---
Never worked for me, like all bugged quests I just gave up and did other things.
---
Update: Server hop worked.
---
I can't get any veins to register with my camera; the one acquired through the quest.
---
We all agree.
---
I'm going to have to make another "jail" to put my crops in.
---
Start it over. I had to go back to FD and we activate the quest on the note. Then run it all in order again
---
Yeah it's not so much I'm bothered the mode will exist, it's more feeling they could spend their time working on things the majority of us want. Stop throwing pvp game modes at us and make it a little more reliable etc.
---
I only charge for Fasnacht-plans, the rest I drop for newbies in the Overseers camp.
---
I had this happen during a trade. I logged into the game and had a SB on my house. I ran off to get enough distance to fast travel to a guy I’m selling stimpaks too. He got tired of waiting around for me and fast travels to my house while I’m fast traveling to him. He spawns in my house and can’t leave because of the SB. I had left my door locked so he becomes hostile to my turrets and now had a bounty.
---
Well we finally finished off the SB and I have him a good discount and a mercy killing.
---
Still bugged
---
There is that, but because I'm of the opinion of I can't do it without leaving the game is not part of the game to me
---
Yeah i can't wait till i spend all my scrips for 7x nocturnal armor :D
---
I would be stoked for that.. especially if they let you guys put your camps just a little bit closer together..
---
player towns would be cool
---
But maybe for Vending..
---
Thanks dude. 
---
Im currently Living in 76 until taxes get lowered.
---
Thanks alot man! Just bought one for 55 caps from the bear rug vendor. Wow wish i knew that 3h ago 😅😂
---
There is zero reason to lie about a bug like this, especially when multiple people are having the issue.
---
The stimpack thing was all 25 they had for sale. They had 25 for sale at 25 caps each. All were sold and all they got was 225 caps. For all lf their stimpacks. So it isn't just they got confused about someone only buying a few and the buggy ui making them think they sold more.
---
Thank you this will help alot at least now i know where to go its like that keyvon the rollercoasters ina random ass spot
---
Let camps snap together on the borders
---
This.. I'm on Xbox, and have so many plans. It takes forever to price 120 plans at a specific price. I always go for the default.
---
Anything of value goes for 1250, 2500 or 3750. I just use the bumpers. I don't have time to price individually.
---
If anyone on Xbox knows an easier way, let me know!
---
Its survival, we are all targets regardless of level
---
Lol, we should get more points to our luck.
---
You only have OPs Username and a random number and without anymore information about him you say its unhealthy? Cool
---
Reading alot of this. I do it often on pc. Maybe its a main/side quest or something you guys haven't taken
---
Did you complete Miner? My pic of coal deposit won’t take. Also Photographer - can’t get the “take camera pic on the rain” to pop. :(
---
Trying to get yourself in the Clyde Chronicles, are we?
---
My husband got it at launch and loved it enough that he got it for his brother and I. I'm level 36, and most of it is scrapping, building, and cooking! Play the game you want to play!
---
&gt; Hey people im a big fallout fan 
---
?  Initial release date: 14 November **2018**
---
Watoga Transportation Hub, the terminal that opens the treasure room door. And the diner east of the Watoga Shopping Mall as well (it opens a lvl 3 safe).
---
Made more do’ than irl already
---
I see they have new ones out but how do I get them now ?
---
The chances of getting the exact item you want with good legendary effects is pretty low.
---
Nocturnal, Berserker, Ghoul Slayer, Mutant Slayer... 
---
And the devs will surely lower the chances of getting Bloodied, Explosive, Anti-armor, etc., so that people keep grinding and playing.
---
Tip: You need an assaultron circuit board to craft the blade. A circuit board can be found next to the destroyed robot at the Miner's Monument.
---
Also can’t put roofs over the top section of the stairs.
---
Hmmmm I’m not so sure, only reason being that you can already send a message if your genuinely interested in something but maybe don’t have the caps but if it haggling was as easy as a button press then everyone could be potentially trying to haggle over everything all the time and that could end up,being so disruptive to gameplay that you end up having to delete your shop which means everyone loses
---
Nocturnal wood armor
---
Why the snark? It's a fair and legitimate question. People who frequent the sub and have followed the game would know if the game has changed to the point that others would want to go back in.
---
They're looking for advice because they trust your opinion, and for some reason, people take it as an opportunity for unearned superiority.
---
What more information would I need? 1200 hours is absolutely all day every day nonstop. I enjoy the game too but that’s a very serious amount of time bordering on a problem. Love getting downvoted for being flabbergasted by a ludicrous number lol
---
cant wait, the price gouging going on is insane.  for example i saw a tse tesla go for 30k before, it doesn't even chain cause of explosive so its already a dead perk. the price is just high cause "lol cant get this useless item"
---
Or kill few assaultrons in watoga. Those are low level, not so hard to kill, for unlocking that mod you may need to scrap some of them too.
---
Haha yeah and they get absolutely nothing in return for it. /s
---
Okay.
---
I'm absolutely not trying to imply anyone is lying, but 
---
&gt;The stimpack thing was all 25 they had for sale. They had 25 for sale at 25 caps each. All were sold and all they got was 225 caps
---
Are you OP because this wasn't mentioned anywhere?
---
And again, if you want to show video proof, you kind of need to have proof of what you had before in terms of inventory vs after.
---
By that logic we can remove the "components needed" tab in the crafting UI, since the wiki has the recipes listed.
---
Same things happened to me man , it’s annoying a’f
---
Well, with this patch we couls finnaly have 3* wood armor, which would be best for sneak builds.
---
This is a common bug, I'm on PC and bodies get sucked into all kinds of surfaces, sometimes if I wait the meatpile get dumped out into the world, mostly I can't be bothered waiting and just leave.
---
Pay 2 Win much?
---
Damn, and I thought I was "unique" with my outfit, the Faschnacht beret and imposter sheepsquatch outfit looks great though, I just dislike how the backpack sort of clips with the fur
---
I have 25k pie.
---
PAY TO WIN ALERT!!! PAY TO WIN ALERT!!!
---
I feel attracted to duping, but I'm not going to. Honest man's work is the best man's work. Duping man's work is the one that gets you banned.
---
Duping is just fucked up. How can you do that shit? After getting banned, you go complain on Reddit and be like "OOH ME BIG INNOCENTO SENIÓR", except your 7th post on Reddit is "yeah i duped some legacy items and op items", and after that is just a bunch of spam comments to cover your post up.
---
Have some decency.
---
i have full bolstering + ap refresh heavy BoS combat armor. Any weapons you’d recommend? Like an AA+Fire rate LMG or anything?
---
Yeah I’m on PS4 and it’s done the same thing to me 2 days in a row.
---
Bugger doing it again. Repetition is boring.
---
Nice, thank you!
---
Yeah I just want to be able to go "stealth" on a whim.
---
Um... I mean real life patches in their store online. Like T-shirts and pip boy statues.
---
Drankster033
---
I just wouldn't want to risk losing my characters, or even worse my entire account.
---
Give it another year.
---
This used to happen at the nukashine, you would either get a boarded up door of it would say inaccessible for future content, I suspect this is the same bug so just change servers till you get an opening door as this was the workaround for Biv
---
Don't worry we all had this glitch, and that's a good one
---
Fast travel away or zone into a building, then go back. It doesn’t work 100% of the time but majority of the time that works for me. For a disclaimer, expect the body to be in the general area but doubtfully the same exact area.
---
Exactly how I feel.
---
That's way too underpriced. It's calibrated shocks, after all. Those things really ate my Violet flux out, too.
---
I put all the extra ammo i don’t need in my machine and set it to 0. It usually isn’t much but I hope my customers recognize the kind gesture, especially when they are considering other, larger purchases from me
---
It is correct. And yes I like to take practice swings with my sharp Golf club on all resulting bugs.  If you need to test the theory, slow down when button mashing when picking up kindling.
---
Oh good, I have at least 13 of the same survivor stories he can have.
---
Why are people downvoting this? I believed OP wants real, physical badges. He even said, online store, not atomic shop
---
Can I get a flamer off you please, if you're on PC? lol
---
I got over it and love this style!
---
I feel like this could (and should) come with a wave of updates etc. for the current PvP mechanics, which could make the PvP fun. I don't play this game for the PvP, but I'm not averse to it. Also with how big the game is supposed to be I'm sure there are enough people who this is warranted by. It also could attract in more people. More people should equate to better updates because of profit etc.
---
I see this as something that I won't or am unlikely to make use of, but could benefit the community as a whole.
---
This is 100% incorrect. You sir/ma’am are not being a constructive redditor.
---
Love it haha😂 Hope we soon can sell our photos and display them in our camp on a kinda similar note.
---
Nuke silo's, the first room where you start destroying those motherboards, right after you fixed the pipes in the irradiated area. 
---
Rush through it and you can hit all 3 nuke silos in about 10-15mins
---
Instigating fatman for me. Gonna get me some 1500 damage start offs
---
I have a picture on my pc of a Mr. Handy with three cats, and another with three or four dogs. Shot pictures, not guns. 😀
---
The only thing folks want to track since they added tracking and we can’t track them
---
I can't even find the generator room. The entire quest is just about getting a sample from a scorchbeast, which is a ton of effort, depending on your playstyle. I need a scorchbeast to LAND to efficiently take it out.
---
This is what a friend of mine did and I figured I could out-class him. Turns out I was wrong! Lol.
---
Thank you for the suggestion. As it happens, I already have a perfect room for hiding a switch. I'll mess around with it when I log in next.
---
I know, right?
---
We all know, right?
---
Oh you want scout content for atom shop, it sounded like you wanted to buy badges.
---
I already saw on all the locations on like 5, o 6 servers,... and more than 20 swaps on other spots such the lighttower :_(
---
Did you get the mission paper from Fort Defiance? I’m only asking because I recurved the quest without picking it up, and wasn’t able to do anything after getting the DNA until I picked up the paper. 
---
PS: The paper is on the fourth floor of Fort Defiance, and is in one of the rooms and on a table.
---
Lol
---
For some reason, I can still place roofs over them. I think the stairs themselves are bugged. Hopefully they fix it soon.
---
I feel as though you are some sort of bot trying to sew arguments. Or there is a loss in translation.
---
the tadpole one is 30lb but its lvl 20..u can go to the tinkers bench straight away and craft a lvl 50 one which gives you 60 carry weight..i dont know if the possum backpack has more carry weight or its just another skin..but you can get high capacity mod to carry more than 60
---
Good man, I'll head over there and hop till I find it, thanks!
---
No, not the atom shop - the actual Bethesda shop for IRL merchandise.
---
Second that. 
---
I’m primarily a sniper build, but switched level 40-50 to melee as grinding for ammo sucks. ** hammer-&gt; Took down an alpha deathclaw last night, 6 hit kill.  3 hits barely did any damage. Each landing on her head.
---
This must be server and network related being so variable, also my most hated mechanic is (on PC) playing mostly melee I can click my left mouse button furiously and only about 1 in 6 proc and fire a swing.
---
Always been like it and I'm just used to it now, I do die in mobs often but so long as I can get to my bag I'm not worried. Frustrating regardless.
---
Pioneer Scout cosplay or just want to frame them?
---
Just server hop. That should work.
---
Reading is Hard for people. I feel what you're after. Would be pretty cool!
---
I did it over 50times and in last phase you must use fire (feed it with those wood or whatever) or you fail. Once you don't have egout of it in inventory, you can't keep fire going, so you have to pick another wood'' and bring it to fire.
---
So when someone pick it in front of me and don't use fire, we lose. 
---
Now i can atleast see why i fail when there are people around...... When i see how most of you argue over fact.
---
Yeah I bad to fight off level 50 kf those tiny flying bots when I was on my level 18 character to protect some guys base I just wanted to buy .45 ammo
---
I want to put them in a backpack
---
That may work then all the player vendors will be heaving with cheap TSE shottys :))
---
Nice! I have now a new objective, collecting stuff to cook \ô/
---
I missed out on the scouts and always wanted those lil patches :)
---
Data leaking? It's a video game dude lmao
---
Nope didn't get the paper
---
Fuck i am dumb :D that would be cool! Thanks for your patience.
---
This is... intense! My day has been made.
---
She and yes! Thank you :)
---
Yeah seriously I've seen himike 4 times I have a level 144, 77, 20, and 22  and one of the times he was after someone else
---
No problem. I loathe pay to win too ;)
---
I see they have new American flags now how do I get them ??
---
I did the event for the first time last night, went solo through the first stages, then another player joined, we were slaughtering everything, but then the event failed, and I have no idea why.
---
I don't like the event, but I will try again using my tesla rifle for better mob control. Of course this means only half the number of lootable corpses, but what gives?
---
"I fight for the user" is from Reboot, I do believe.
---
These are teh same people that have hooked up an ingame cash shop to real world payment methods. If they badly misscode one section then it makes me have doubts about another section.
---
I think you've used all you luck for life. Be careful crossing the street....
---
Not what I meant, clarified in edit.
---
The Gutter weapon that’s rewarded for the burrows is an Assaultron blade and can be electrified, also the Mr Handy buzzblade can be electrified I think, also check train station vendors for electrified plans as I think there are other melee weapons that can be modded in this way. For the photo you’ve said “sub station” I thought it was a photo of a generator and if I remember right the fusion core generator wouldn’t work so I built one of the small or medium generators at a workshop and that worked. If you are after substations though they are all over the place and you can find one right across the road from the sunshine meadows food factory public workshop in flatwoods.
---
It would certainly put a twist on hiking the AT.
---
yes it's not really a solution but does improve QoL a little
---
Claim workshops and defend workshops are pretty easy to get exp and items. Also the daily events are easy to get exp
---
I always sell the assassin pieces to the vendors. No one really pvps anymore. No rewards really over there. Plus the -8 damage doesn’t mean much when they can still vats crib you in one shot. 
---
You may find a buyer though, I’ve seen stranger things. As for pve, the sent modifiers really work well.
---
It's just too bad that it is labeled junk and not aid.
---
It won't craft for the blackberry honey crisp.
---
Okay, thank you so much !
---
You're welcome!
---
After nerf it does not stack, so if you plan to camp pure sentinel is better. Also that works for mobs and gives me ability to survive atleast one hit from imposter sheepsquatch.
---
Yeah I don't know about all that because 1) yes, other players can't hurt your CAMP as of the last major patch and 2) I was at an event a while ago not having shot a single round and another player killed me almost instantly to take my scrap (like an asshole).
---
IMO trading is about getting what is right for your build—not what is rare—and accordingly the dupers do not reduce my fun.
---
I think what I'm going to do is take a screenshot of each machines menu and then at the end of the day just compare what I have in the pick against what I have in the machine.
---
Because nobody has ever in history put a cash shop in a video game and had bugs with the game.
---
Cssh shops never have problems lol. Cuz it's way simpler than things like this.
---
This. This could all be fixed if turrets started attacking enemies that were in shooting range.
---
Lol nah just wanna learn more about this Clyde team up some lol
---
 Bloody builds can use it to get to lower health really fast
---
PS4 still suffers from bugs. I can't play for more than an hour continuously because it will bug out or just stop.
---
They didn't lose anything. It's working as intended, just a visual mistake.
---
At plans you see (known) which is great, bcos you can but everything you don't. My hobby.
---
Aw ye! I can finally get that Junky's/nocturnal +25％ fire rate +1 Agility Dragon (unhealthy sarchasm :-p) It took me since the BETA to find a Zealot's +fire rate 10mm through playing and checking vendors and combing through the market, and while you're right that the price of 3★ is going to drop in general it seems optimistic that everybody's going to start grinding out ★ and ★★'s enough to flood the market with ★★★, or if they're going to turn in 2.25 ★★★ star for every 1 they get back instead of taking those ★★★'s and putting them out into the market. We'll see, though
---
Dupers downvoting me lol
---
I really wish the game had pre set lots for camps so we could really squeeze in together and make towns and player centers.
---
Honest answer: because we see this topic multiple times every. single. day. 
---
Im trying out new answers to an old and very tired question - that's why the snark :)
---
"Beth pls"
---
Since over-repair DR bonus was removed, all armor is potentially worse.
---
West tek, sugar grove, cranberry bog, glasses cavern, anywhere in the mire
---
Is it worth anything?
---
The Uranium Fever event at Blackwater Mine usually gives out 3 legendary items from enemies, one or two of them being 3 star.  I got most of my explosive weapons from it.
---
I need this also, I'll help you out GT: Blackout7197 I'll add you.
---
Did you already forget the canvas bag doxx fiasco? 'It's a video game dude lmao'
---
Ha! Another thing I’d love to do.
---
TLDR the title
---
Not that I know of. It’s easy to get from Wes Tek
---
A mother's day event in Grafton would be really nice. It could give out cool plans like flowers for our camps or a recipe for chocolates.
---
I usually pick up half a dozen when I go there
---
Not sure if it’s making any difference but I’m using the insect repellent I keep getting awarded for the Stings and Things daily challenge but after a few goes at the new event I’m beginning to hate bugs lol 🦟🦗🐜🦂
---
shut up
---
Is there a limit / at the vendor? Pretty sure it will be...
---
Ok, join on me when your ready
---
Whitesprings golf course is a very good place to level up. Probably have accumulated around 40 levels from there. You may have to server hop because usually people are there also. The enemies levels range from 9-62 (not 100% accurate) so if the enemies levels are too high you may want to server hop.
---
If I could give my gamer tag to a website and see all the known and unknown, I would be very happy!
---
Start hunting achievements
---
Thank you!!
---
Okay thank you I will try there !
---
Possessing duped items Is different to duping. If you have a duped TSE they won't be able to tell you duped because it's one singular item. Dupers are obviously duping when they have tons of an exact same item of great rarity and they are the ones who get caught
---
What does the armor sell for with out Assassin perk ,  example unyielding , weightless , weight reduction , radiation resistance  etc..
---
PC here and I get issues a lot.  I will sometimes very briefly see the countdown timer slide in then immediately back out but much of the time when I click to confirm the fast travel it just closes the map and nothing happens.  Sometimes it's more reliable if I use the enter key instead of clicking but it's kind of a crap shoot.
---
Make mules and fill them with caps. Make different builds for each so you have to acquire different armor and weapons.
---
use the lvl 3 terminals and shut off the the turrets, makes it less caotic. also, do it some more times and youre gonna solo it like a champ. melee with the relevent perks makes short work of the robots
---
You saw 2 weapons, that doesn't really mean anything...
---
But well, I personally don't like TSE weapon at all... I don't like their feeling and their origin is always doubtful
---
I have a fenced in garden that I had a radstag stuck in so I stored my carrots and one of the fences to get it out.  I was able to place the fence back, but no matter what I do the carrots always say they are floating even if they're directly on the ground!
---
White springs
---
You could start over? Or just take a break.
---
2? Just go onto the ps4 trading market and you'll see what I mean..... I've seen well over 10 in the last 4 or 5 hours.
---
You mean they only in drops, right? They would still be able to purchase it from another player?
---
I thought so as well, yet dude managed to kill you, so those are the only obvious methods?
---
I’ve done the same but the acid came in handy for the smelting ore part of the metalworkers badge lol
---
  r/AppalachianTrail   
---
Live the dream.
---
I look for good Zealot's, Medic's, and Berserker gear: as people don't seem to keep gear that's not for the DPS meta this stuff's rarer than Legacy weapons, I've found (I've seen so many TSE weapons in the game that they seem like an expected stage of play for some vault dwellers)
---
yes. although most of them will only trade legacy weapons for other legacy weapons.
---
at least that was the case up until a couple days ago.
---
The giant teapot was the easiest for me, the tourist is usually on one of the picnic tables as soon as you load it. Server hop and you'll get one in no time!
---
The only problem is the highest level that will drop is 40, so keep that in mind. I still run it all the time for the other mats you receive.
---
You need to get the paper report because it has that password for the research terminal. The quest will start working correctly *again* when you put the password into the terminal.
---
Also it’s not much but if you stay well rested as much as possible you get an experience bonus. For the purposes of leveling up sleep in a bed and then trace to white springs to get that extra xp. Server hop until the bonus runs out then do it again
---
Correct.  Only dupers who are foolish enough to leave multiples in their inventory will be findable.   But duping which does not crash the server is otherwise unnoticeable.
---
Like certain parts of the badges aren’t working for people like the music one and the frog one etc etc
---
Lol. Right?
---
I did steal one from my fiance, though.
---
He still hasn't noticed.
---
The only thing 1H weaps have going for them is that they are usable in PA as a backup weapon without taking up a lot of weight.
---
I'm very jealous of your experience. After the servers reset and the game was smooth as silk for me, it genuinely felt more like one of the single player fallouts where damage was registered instantly and there wasn't lag when picking up items and using switches. 
---
I'm happy it's improved things for you, I only wish I could say the same.
---
I wonder if it is related to the timer, as I don’t recall experiencing this issue prior to its introduction?
---
Is that true?  I think I got an AAE The Dragon from it yesterday.
---
Part of the new scouts expansion. First things I bought with the tokens.
---
Ya, I can’t put roofs over the section of the stairs opening to the second level.
---
On XB, looking for at least 8K. 3rd* is weight reduction and its fully modded.
---
Planning in making a merit badge sash op?
---
It's a pretty nice weapon to pull out for scorchbeasts midair. Unfortunately the rules of range still apply, so if you're too far away it will do nothing, but if it's just flying nearby then you can use the targeting computer to hit it and take off chunks of its health at a time. I'm only using an anti-armor one and it demolishes. It can one-shot some weaker enemies like scorched, too. A couple missiles for the bigger ones like glowing gulpers. I'd say it could still use a buff considering how heavy the ammo/weapon is and how inconvenient it is to use in this game, but it's not worthless
---
Go on a shopping spree. I drained all my caps the last few days, built a new set of power armor and crafted a bunch of weapons that I still need to learn mods for. Now I need to restock almost everything, and it feels like sweet relief.
---
I like how nonsensical topics get high upvotes, but serious issues like this get downvoted...
---
seems to be I end up with 30 40 and 50 % power cores - to keep my inventory clean I get rid of them on my vender at 1 a charge.
---
Bethesda dosent give a shit about you or the game they only care about the money ot generates. Bgs has proved this over and over. I dont understand why the surprise. Im surprised you get any money period. This is the reason i dont play anymore but love reading the comments on reddit. Triple a game my ass. More like a triple A swindle. Fyi it is proven that every patch will create 50 more bugs for every bug fixed.
---
That’s a lie. It works out about 4 hours a day and that definitely is Not all day everyday
---
Speaks volumes about the community unfortunately.
---
You will also loose the reproach, it expires once its condition has deteriorated. So get that one last...
---
Noone cares about this ugly costumes :D
---
Thank you so much.
---
I've got a 25,000 cap toxic goo in mine. Along with some free stuff.
---
As awesome as it would be, I'm happy they didn't put anything in there. It would be kinda messed up to celebrate mother's day in game, and not with your real mom.
---
I'm pretty sure I have something for 25k in mine unless they patched it.
---
Level 2 people inside whitesprings
---
Yup stopped using Gauss alltogether until this is fixed, rocking a handmade now
---
You can absorb those sweet, sweet rads!!
---
Fallout 76 has to be one of my favorite games. I do not own it but its failures have brought me hours of good reading.
---
It’s not tricking if they make it known. This also isn’t 25 years to life we’re talking about as punishment.
---
Having the same issue. I’m unable to complete the Dolly Sods pests clean up quest. Stuck on 3/4 sub quests to unlock the backpack. 
---
Have you had any luck with fixing the issue? I’ve tried everything I can think of. Hope they are able to fix this. No able to unlock the backpack because of these bugs. Super annoyed.
---
Everytime the prize bot tells me I owe something or that they will use my info without my permission, bam.
---
Can we also have enemies despawn at some point? I was playing yesterday and two scorchbeasts spawned at my house and I really didn't have the resources to deal with them so I had to go and take a workshop (where there were more scorchbeasts but at least they despawned after I left the workshop) to craft things without having my camp destroyed. I had to server hop to get rid of them since they still hadn't left half an hour later.
---
I saw someone selling one for 200 caps last night.
---
You can get multiple tags in one photo.  Nuke Zones are great for this with the rarer, high-level mobs.
---
I do, here's a link to the Pale Rider (which is really cool in my opinion, I don't really care about what other people think, I like the details): [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/atl4ix/datamine\_all\_rider\_power\_armor/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/atl4ix/datamine_all_rider_power_armor/)

---
With the "someone else's camp is in your spot" feature you don't risk anything by sharing your spot with other players. If you don't want to share the location, is there any media you can share? I'm curious about "inside the mountain" as I'm sure others are.
---
I dropped something for him but the server was lagging so much it took ages for the item to appear, so he attacked me. Then he instantly got melted into a goo pile
---
I sold a you have been insulted note for 2000 so good day to the guy who bought it
---
I made a post about this and it straight up got removed by the mods.
---
I always keep a bunch of it to give myself mutations.. it's the safest way I've found as I can sit at my camp and use radaway immediatly after.. I keep a few hundred in my stash
---
&gt;If you are after substations though they are all over the place and you can find one right across the road from the sunshine meadows food factory public workshop in flatwoods.
---
Yea, I mean them I guess, but I cant photo them. I just have photo of generator
---
Yeah, we need more emotes in general. I went to do the thumbs up emote, accidentally selected the team-up emote and immediately used the 'No' emote and ran away. Damn virtual social anxiety.
---
yea  i'm stuck at 3 outta 4 but i can't get the kiddie corner cabins to trigger but if you read my issue it's super bugged
---
? Why do you need it to give yourself mutations?
---
You need 2 Tadpole badges
---
Yea currently I have all of them except the vegetarian one
---
Well the limit is you can only get 150 scrip a day and can only carry 1000 at a time currently so that's 1 1/2 3 star a day
---
Your response gives me hope and I should test this out. I might be focusing on the negatives unfairly without seeing this positive. Last night was particularly bad or I wouldn't have made the post. 
---
I love this game despite all it's issues but as the AVGN famously said: "What's the most important part of any game? Being able to fuckin' play it!". 
---
There were times over my 300 hours with Fallout 76 where that was true to a T... The game became literally unplayable. Over the last few months it's seemed more and more stable... Until now. So maybe I'm paying more attention to that stuff than I should. I'll hop on today and check it out.
---
Yeah since I made that mistake, TWICE, I've started individually scrapping junk...and that's actually helped me keep what I need and getting rid of extra crap I don't.
---
I don't even understand how there's 3.4k people actively on the reddit, yet there's far less people playing the game... 
---
Are the numbers skewed somehow?
---
Yes and no. They’re always badasses, but eventually they get manageable unless they have a ton of levels on you.
---
Yes, but they arnt as bad when u have good guns lol
---
Yeah , but is there a limit how many you can get from the vendor each day ?
---
It was cheaper than getting serums and with the perk making the negative effects 75% less theres not too much downside lol
---
It's a real give-and-take with this game cause the improvements are incredible and the board, but there are always things that stick out as needing help.
---
That works, you need to make the jar, have it in inventory, find a frog, approach said frog and CLICK on him, he disappears into the jar. Now go to CAMP and build with this full-of-frog jar in your inventory and it will work :)
---
I mean I have had a bunch too.  For like 6 months.  Why do you need toxic goo to take them?  I never did and my mutations took just fine.  
---
Or are you saying to get them the old fashioned way, not with serums?
---
You can't imagine.
---
I died from a stray gutsy while soloing a nuke silo yesterday. I go back into the room with my junk, game instantly crashes feet away from all the screws and ballistic fiber I could ever want.
---
I load into a different server, just sit there wondering what to do next. Then, somebody buys my berserker's swing speed super sledge. All that precious stash space...
---
You mean 6.7 hours per day. Fallout 76 released on the 14th of November last year, 179 days ago. 179 x 24 = 4,269, 4269/1200 = 3.58, 24/3.58 = 6.7 rounded, or 6 hours and 42 minutes. I’m not calling him a loser because I have wayyyy more than that spread across various games, and he could have a legit reason, but that is a LOT of time. Over half the day every day.
---
You got Stockholm Syndrome bro. 
---
Duper's might as well own 50% of Bethesda as much as they've fucked with this game. I didn't come into this thinking TSE Sentinel would be standard issue inside a few months. We will never know the game we could have had, the one we purchased. The lifespan of fo76 has been cut short because of them. They retain all of their power, all of their resources, and we are at their Mercy.
---
Yeah my bad I wrote this after I repriced my items for the 3rd time and wanted to get my point across while being respectful and not rage like I really wanted to.
---
Huh, alright then. 
---
Also are mirelurk queens generally buggy? I ran into one with a friend (who had beaten the game) and we managed to kill it without dying. It just let us hit it for ever
---
Ah, so only if I’ve beaten the game
---
You’re right, for some reason I thought it was October 14th lol
---
I saw the clean wall American flag in the build menu. What is the second one?
---
That is what I get for assuming they capped it. I haven't had a moment to play since the middle of last month. :(
---
Because they don't drop anymore...
---
Us flag pole. Like the ones used inside.
---
No.  U can get good guns earlier in the game. Im level 116 and still hate versing deathclaws
---
Guy was straight up griefing. Just didn't admit it.
---
That don't mean, they couldn't have it from before patch.
---
If someone who defends a company blindly is a boot licker then people who obsess constantly over how terrible something is beyond reason should be a shit eater, because you're sure as hell full of it
---
Yea that's the way I did them, i didnt play with anyone for the most part so serums were expensive and hard to come by for me. Toxic goo was the quickest thing i could find to irradiate myself.
---
That’s amazing dude!
---
No i love this game dudes.Just not like scout
---
Just items. Plans are all backpack or camp items
---
Half right. This is true for some of them, like junk or meds/food, but weapons are treated differently for some reason. The umbrella weapon weight reduction is independent of individual class reduction perks. I have an instigating experimental mirv that weighs like 1.2 pounds, because I have three 20% weapon weight reduction pieces + bear arms. The bonus is multiplicative on the remaining weight after perks, but since it caps at 90% for the armor set and the highest reduction from perks is 90%, you can reach 99% weapon weight reduction on heavy weapons. Pretty sure it also stacks with the weightless legendary effect, although that doesn't affect the weight from weapon mods
---
Oh good. I'm not the only one noticing it.   
---
It makes server hopping a lot more annoying let me tell you.
---
It's a great addition that encourages you to explore every little bit of the world.  While some people are complaining that it's grindy and they can't get all the new shit on day zero, it's a long, looong list of side challenges that should provide extra stuff in case you've cleared all your other to-dos.  Make your way to specific landmarks.  Take pictures of mobs and scenery.  Generally, aside from the vast number of challenges, it's very chill in relation to other quests.
---
However, some of the challenges are bugged or unspecific, like the Frog Jar or collecting bones with a fedora(does anybody know which fedora works BTW? Not the Crumpled Fedora).  While these will momentarily prevent all players from earning certain badges, they're sure to be fixed, most likely in the next patch.
---
I’ll have to play with you some time lol. Personally I’m insane and like to meele the the f out of enemies. (Without guns, if they have guns I’ll keep my distance) sledgehammer and fire axe ftw
---
With gladiator and incisor, this thing becomes a real beast of a little butter knife.
---
I never got into melee weapons
---
Yeah it never drops max level items. Got a lvl 35 tse gauss there as my first tse drop long time ago.
---
Trying having a conversation with one person having a mic and one using emotes. It’s clear Bethesda didn’t care or at least test for that type of situation. Still had a great team up for a couple hours due the other guy being really nice, but it was clear they weren’t designed to replace a mic
---
That’s fine, but it’s very satisfying to slam a hammer into a scorched’s face
---
What would you say is a good price for a 1* vampire's .50 cal? I sold a vampire's LMG for 850, I'm slowly dropping the price for the .50 cal and it's still not selling
---
Upvote ! ! That would be a must buy for me :D
---
Let's hope it'll come true.
---
I’ve reached out on Twitter. Hopefully we’ll get some acknowledgement from Bethesda: https://twitter.com/danielstormapps/status/1127592352309227521?s=21
---
Yes that might help... PS4
---
SB level 7.157e+118 = 80!
---
I didnt say it doesnt drop legendaries, I said the highest is level 40; there are several posts about this. Unless something has recently changed, check your weapon to verify.
---
I bet lol
---
I'm sure he can since you get the plans off a terminal
---
Do we know whether or not ingame items have a unique code, if they do and duped items are created with consecutive numbers like counterfeit bank notes then if your TSAAEBV shotgun has one of those numbers they could just delete it from the game.
---
Did you try reinstalling the game? People have said that helps especially if you're from beta.
---
You got lucky lol. Occasionally they will bug out, but if you have to fight them outright they are the most dangerous creatures out there.
---
I hope so too
---
Not everybody has a mom to celebrate with. It would be appropriate within the game, as the overseer is our collective "mom" in a way
---
Had that happened to me the other day he was just chilling on the road.
---
I had to do this also for 4 full machines -_-
---
I sell all plans I know for 25 caps in my vending machine, caps aren't worth much to me so why not help players out for cheap :)
---
It's mentioned by others in this thread that also is having this issue. That is why it seems more likely than not to be a real bug. As for no video of the inventory numbers of course not, outside of streamers most don't have screen capture software running while they play. Hell I doubt most people even have OBS downloaded and installed.
---
So of course there won't be videos, why would there be? No one expects a bug to happen. Id be more suspicious of someone who happens to have a perfect recording showing everything, as that would be so out of the ordinary for how 99% of people play the game.
---
Thanks for the info! Unfortunately the map only shows outdoor spawns and not world spawns, but I will gladly head over there and see if I can locate it and update.
---
Heh, thought crossed my mind
---
https://xboxclips.com/crozetdragons15/ac26a8cc-ed71-4398-adb7-8bb48902f6dd
---
Wait, I want to jump while wiring. 
---
Why not map it to the crouch/sneak button?
---
They nerfed all the weapons so much, that the the meta now is a stick. Which only drops feom the SBQ, so good luck punching her enough to get her to drop one. There's only one person in the game right now who managed to glitch kill the queen, and he duped like 20k sticks, but he's charging like $20 rl dollars, so only his best buds have sticks, and they're all raiders.
---
Good luck playing with no weapons, when his "raider" buddies do nothing but kill steal, because they can do massive stick damage, and the rest of us are just using dull rocks. Then they start beating us with the sticks (thank goodness for no slap dmg amiright???), and call us stickless trash.
---
So, if that sounds like fun to you, then you should join our S&amp;M roleplaying group, the "Stickless Wonders". We meet every Tuesday, but don't accept invites from some guy named Mo0kish, he creeps even the wierdos out.
---
This!
---
That's a great point too, I just know there are gamers out there who would be more excited about new content than spending time with their mom. But you're right about that.
---
If anyone knows where to get the plans for t60 set let me know! the parts not the mods.
---
Also this
---
Was my encounter... I was terrified
---
I'm down GT: scottjowitt
---
Maybe disable creature spawns on non owner fast-travel entry to a camp? 
---
I found a very nice spot, but every time anyone showed up 5 glowing radfrogs would pop out of the ground, it became something everyone had to deal with, and I moved shortly.
---
You want a bloodied weapon, and you want either unyielding or Bolstering armors. Bolstering will increase DR when low health and unyielding will increase special stats when low health.
---
Agreed. Just built a new camp... had to start over several times because I couldn’t delete a couple foundations (was close to the end) that apparently would make a part of the structure inaccessible. Also I get the floating thing a lot too but exiting build and going back in helps me. Another thing (I’m gonna make a post abt this one) is that I have been having built items disappear but my budget stays the same. What gives Bethesda??!!
---
Whew, thought I was being kinda dorky but .. safety in numbers
---
You understand how tax works right? It steps up over thresholds... So you only pay large tax % if you're earning great amounts of money and only on whatever your earning past the previous bracket...
---
Psn same as here.. Add me and I'll die for you lol..
---
Lol, you and everyone else. 
---
Ever since the “One-Shot” nerf, a lot of weapons have become worthless.
---
I think the game struggles to tell when you’re in or out of combat. You can witness this with healing factor mutation too. 
---
They said they were going to attempt to reduce the amount of “one-shots” by doing something to your first attack. This could possibly be the issue, as the game might register many of your swings as the “first” attack
---
Hey! I have updated the post with flux maps now
---
So a full set doesn’t not stack for sentinel or cavalier? So at most you get-15% damage when the effect procs?
---
Stop having enemies spawn at CAMPs upon arrival entirely, own CAMP or not. Set the enemy spawn on fast travel to 5-10 minutes.
---
So annoying waiting for your buildings to appear while they’re being eaten by invisible enemies.
---
It's natural market progression. If people are willing to pay an amount for the plan, that is its value. Not sure if we will ever reach a true equilibrium based on how decentralized the stores are, but it will definitely come closer to a single market value for each item over time. Right now is still experimentation time for people
---
“What’s this, a user has a good idea? Get out of here pleb. Either make a mod yourself or wait until we release a new game that sucks. This is Bethesda, not customer support. Jesus”
---
True, celebrate your Mom (of course)!  
---
I was just thinking it would have been cool to see a note trail, statue, or something in Grafton mentioning the historical significance, was all I meant to say.
---
Yeah I know. 
---
Still we got one of the highest taxes in the world
---
No no, my point is they kept their word. AT LAUNCH, 76 was completely soloable. Now with new additions, it's okay it isn't.
---
Oh yeah I am. I just meant the weapon I found was over 40
---
About 30% of the time the legendaries I kill just disappear
---
The message that you're exceeding camp budget when trying to sell items is just a UI error - relog and it will go away. Usually it's because your stash is full and when you try to sell an item from your personal inventory the game attempts to stash it, this triggers the budget message instead of stash full message.
---
Keep in mind weight reducing perks for heavy weapons and such are only in effect for items on your person - their weights will revert to default if you stash them.
---
It's easy to accidentally hoard items in this game, so make sure you're regularly cleaning out junk that you don't need. Also be aware that a lot of heavy junk items don't break down when you are mass junking items at a station, heavy things like skulls and larger creature pieces. So it's a good idea to occasionally sort your stash by weight and make sure you don't have an unintentional collection of deathclaw hands or something.
---
All that said I do wish stash and camp budgets were larger. There's a few key issues with longevity, these are two of them.
---
Imo stash should be larger and account bound (similar to diablo) to encourage refilling new characters, and/or respec needs to be friendlier, along with allowing saved perk card setups to swap from situation to situation. Fix these along with stash and budget and I think this would greatly improve quality of life.
---
Awesome! Gimme 5
---
Not much better on PC, we have to use the same horrible movement with keys or just drag the slider. You would think that's nice, but for many items the price starts close to the left edge, and if you don't click the perfect pixel, the game will start just scrolling in a direction instead of dragging the slider.
---
Well I never knew that, most of the time I just turn in the weapons for scrip
---
Sorry term solution: Stop selling.
---
Continuing to walk past on their way to wherever they were going unless specifically aggro'd, if we're discussing reality.  He's right, there would be no standing structure at all in Appalachia if this was their natural behavior.  They would kill every plant, building, wooden plank, all of it until nothing was left anywhere.
---
Well, after all the rigmarole, I'm not sure I need the cert?  
---
Reading the walkthroughs, it looks like I only need the cert to get the ID, which gives me access to the elevator.  Well, I got to the elevator login, and it was already set for me.  Near as I can tell, I have full access to Ft. Defiance, read about Touchdown, and have Belly of the Beast activated with Recruitment Blues shaded out. 
---
Bottom line is that it looks like the quest progressed somehow, perhaps the team glitch 2 months ago, yet I never went through the DMV patience tester.
---
However, where would I look to see if I'm part of the Brotherhood? 
---
Rumbly
---
Um.. Capture previous 5 minutes? (Might just be an Xbox thing)
---
Also if this is ALWAYS happening, as is being suggested, you would have someone test it, and capture it.
---
It's really not mentioned by others, no actual data is being provided.
---
But if you want to attempt to explain how I sold 2000 of an item I only had 1000 of, by all means..the floor is yours.
---
I appreciate what you're doing, but keep in mind a bunch of people will just buy them all to resell at a higher price.
---
U mad bro?
---
Every drill picked out of a three star corpse, every piece of hunters wood armor found, every ghoul slayers gamma gun dropped grants legitimacy to these dupers existence. 
---
Bethesda needs to pull a reaper of souls by increasing both the quality of loot and frequency of drops. That's what makes things like the auction house, dupers, and offline sellers obsolete
---
Do we know what caused duping to start up again? Was that why the punch bowl was nixed?
---
That's not even close to the same thing, real life details =/= how many sticks of bubblegum you own in a video game
---
Ya, did that.  Thanks for the help.  I'll try in a few hours.....
---
Huh...alright then
---
I cannot tell you how happy I was to have killed it though lol
---
Go to the burrows. At least one charred ghoul who has a three star legendary. Got an explosive zealots handmade today.
---
Already in your map btw
---
I've had something like 500 plans hoarded up for this. First day of player vending was just nonstop people buying them. I'm down to only around 300 now, even with all the looting I do I sometimes don't have enough plans and legendaries to fill up all 4 of my machines. They definitely sell, especially stuff like deep pocketed plans and weapon plans
---
That's what the big traders on Wow did. They would have mules constantly scanning the AH with the auctioneer add-on for any undercut mats and would snatch any up that undercut them and then relist them at the higher price.
---
if is battle royale pls we dont want lose loot in pve like survivl
---
That's fine, but calling the amount of ammo you have in a video game "personal information" is pretty dumb 
---
Hell people in this thread are saying that the sellers shouldnt even know how much they bought which is straight idiotic
---
nope just telling you to shut up :)
---
If we had official mod support the user interface could be sooooooo much better
---
Try this on Apex, it's incredible how many no-mic options are available.  You can communicate every nuanced request, need, offering, suggestion, and so on without a microphone.  Then come back to 76 and try to communicate.
---
If you're interested in playing again, just play again.
---
That might be how it is in your country, but tax codes can vary wildly. Some places have flat taxes (everyone pays X%), some have the progressive tax you described. I think Denmark does a funny combination, with different flat and progressive rates for different types of income (investment vs labor vs inherited, etc)
---
Why do you put multiple vending machines up? Isn’t camp limit 30 types of items no matter how many? Actually curious. Cause If it increases your limit I’ll start putting up more vending machines but from what I saw it doesn’t.
---
Bulk all your junk
---
Most people don't run a bloodied berserker build, honestly. They wear armor. Either unyeilding or bolstering or power armor with emergency protocols.
---
Can't give any advice for pvp except to avoid it. As for junkies I'd assume you need to be in withdrawal.
---
I second that!
---
I'm pretty sure he/she means the Assassins does not stack with sentinel but I will let them clarify.
---
Oh no I completely agree! Just stating that kids are already too wrapped up in technology to care about family Haha. Also you taught me something today so thank you!
---
Don't hoard useless crap.
---
My camp has been targeted by 3 at once.  They don't even arrive at the same time, they seem to just randomly find each other.
---
I have 300 plans (around 100 unique ones, there's also some non-plan stuff in my machines) and often get purchases from level 150+ players. Prices are anywhere between 50% and 90% of the default price, except for stuff like mr handy buzz blades or revolver ivory grips that are at like 10%. I know the struggle though, I will buy a plan I don't know yet for pretty much any price
---
Mine shows the total I originally posted for sale, regardless of how many the person purchased or how many were in the inventory when they arrived. I went back to camp three times yesterday to replace ballistic fiber and stimpacks, only to find that three separate sales had been for 2-3 each, not whole stacks like the notification said. Obviously, I will be checking my stash at the nearest train station before jumping all the way back to camp from now on.
---
And make the list long enough so that doesn't have to scroll? It's not like there isn't enough room...
---
And punji boards are higher priority as well
---
No. It's a new system. 30 items *per* machine, and the machine do not share inventory with each other like stashes do. 4 machines = 120 listed ite.s.
---
Oh I did that. I had collected everything but the bloatfly parts and came across a bench. I was wondering a moment later why I suddenly needed everything again. Took it a second to click in my head. Then, while recollecting everything, the radroach meat spoiled and I had to go get that again too.
---
I sell everything for 1 cap, from 3* bloody legendaries to shotgun ammo :-) Just because I can
---
I'd say s0
---
You are right.
---
There are hints in the game files that lead to future updates introducing legendary power armor pieces.
---
I just finished my archery badge last night and I'm done with mine - happy to give it to you.  It's a Medic's Crossbow.
---
And remember if you go shopping and the player has multiple machines, check them all.
---
Don’t get me all excited now hahaha
---
Oh snap! Awesome! 
---
And yes I have been having camp issues too. So hopefully they’ll fix soon
---
That didnt work well lol
---
Does bulking compress the junk very much? Thanks
---
Depends on the bobblehead.  I've been able to sell DPS increasing ones like Big Guns, Small Guns, and Melee for 75c pretty easily, but more niche bobbleheads like Caps or SPECIAL boosts don't sell as quickly.
---
Yeah I finished both of them
---
"tower, river, fork" is a way to remember locations or directions, eg. "Theater, Walmart, first Street left". The tower is near the fork in the river. This is this guy remembering his directions, I can't find any other radio towers near a fork in the river. Landmark navigation, something we did before GPS if we didn't have a map.
---
He mentions reclamation day, he's heading north to find us (76) . TinMan could be any robot he came across between Morgantown and the tower. The bucket of bolts could be modus, or something bigger than modus. 
---
Going by all the recordings in the enclave bunker, the assultron head under the main door inside, the recordings in the cabinet room by the executive suite and the other terminals. I think we have a survivor from the "accident" in the enclave bunker, I don't think it's just modus though, to small, there's something controlling modus or modus is part is a much larger system.
---
Nerd rage in INT, gives a dmg boost, and DR at under 20%.
---
Serendipity is by far the best defensive perk for low health.
---
Bolstering armor gives up to 35 DR and ER per piece at under 20%, so if you can't get sentinal, this is your next best option.
---
Adrenal reaction mutation gives a pretty significant boost to dmg as well.
---
I save Dodgy for PvP, and swap it in/out for White Knight when needed.
---
I run a combination of 2 bolstering (+70 DR/ER), 2 unyielding (+6 Stats), and one Chameleon, all sentinal.
---
Only 6,400 more hours for the playing challenge
---
I always make sure to kill anything that spawns when I load in, &amp; I also go around fixing any broken turrets since they're cheap to repair
---
Aww dang. So it’s finicky.
---
Dope what’s your gt ? I can give you .308 rounds as payment or .45 if you’d like
---
Had this on PS4, myself.
---
Got any hook ups with a heavy metal chameleon sentinal RL?
---
Not very much but if you’re desperate to lose pounds in your stash it’s the way to go.
---
The terminal won't teach you if you already own a set! It happened to a friend of mine when I gave him a set!
---
Bro I don't know, I seen them this morning and was asking myself the same thing
---
Thank you so much! I’ll consider it a Mother’s Day present ❤️. I’ll be on late this afternoon and add you.
---
I heard uranium fever or treasure maps. Didn't get plan in 620hours.
---
Unlike the US your taxes are spent improving life for the entire country.
---
I always do but I thought they were just separating the types of items in the machines and had no idea it increased the selling capacity. Very thankful to find that out!
---
Oof now I feel bad
---
Magazines and bobbleheads that give a flat increase to damage is always welcome
---
The “jump instead of make a connection” bug is in full force when trying to wire things up, I took some workshops and it took me 2x the time to build everything then normal.
---
I can almost guarantee you that BoS combat armor is better. But I understand that you would probably prefer marine armor for the rad resistance.
---
I built one too, out behind my house by the water. Also out of boredom, but sometimes it's fun to come home and see my Brahmin on the court like it wants a game 😁
---
Lol man, i was ok with 400 (have no idea how) now it is ok, just dont have over 150 of any junk, don't hold any aid or ammo.
---
That’s good information to have. I’m only just starting the brotherhood quests this week. Iv been wandering around doing my own thing until level 50 and now I’m starting to get into the quest side of it
---
Every pound counts. Will give it a go thanks
---
Got it-- let me know, now Im curious.
---
While their at it maybe fix the 5 broken ones too
---
12/10 salt I should cook some fries
---
As a citizen of irl Appalachia even our car parks arent flat. We just got use to never having flat ground.
---
You can definitely make additional cameras. Take one of the broken ones you find back to the Tinker bench and you can repair it. Might be convenient to have a couple when I unlock new lenses.
---
How do you start the event? Just turn up and it starts or what?
---
Their swipes are really strong, and over-protection from 200% armor got fixed. So losing out on that ~80-100 DR against such a powerful attack really makes a difference
---
Ey it was no complaint or to put myself in a ‘bad’ standing. 
---
I’m no genius on this topic just know we have a high tax. 
---
Good vibes ❤️
---
Pacify vs Tame... you were likely pacifying which only had a temporary effect
---
Where did you find the other terminals? I’m trying to complete it too but I have no idea where to look.
---
Any specific time of location or does it just appear?
---
I think only Lead and Aluminium are reduced by bulking. Otherwise your just wasting plastic.
---
Uranium Fever, AWOL Armaments, West Tek Reserach, Whitesprings, Huntsville, Monster Mash, One Violent Night, Free Range.
---
Idk how accurate that is considering I had someone buy 400 5.56 last night and I got my 360 caps for it 👀
---
Yeah, it also seems it has something to do with Gauss being a projectile weapon -- hitscans almost never miss like that
---
I recall seeing some several weeks back. I think they've always been there but not 100% sure lol.
---
It pops up on the map immediatly, you just have to go talk to the robot that spawns by the entrance of the mine.
---
Maybe, I’m not sure. But I’ve bulked all of my junk and it seems to make a difference.
---
Have 15 characters
---
Could you make a mod with it for PC? I could make one if you give me your permission to do so. I'll make sure to give you credit and add a link to this post.
---
I think they threw in a new batch of encounters in patch 9. I ran into a level 1 "Injured Super Mutant"  next to some Super mutant corpses with quills in them. He kept muttering about the attack and never attacked my group. "Baah Baah, death."
---
Actually I just found the plan at a vendor thanks tho
---
I think we can easily say there’s pros and cons about everything
---
You want to become unbreakable, is that it?
---
I must've missed where the old fairy tales subbed in a Miss Nanny, but anyway, if you don't like it, just walk away?
---
Launch sites have 3s and 2s, the prison has a 3 and a 1, I looked around Grafton and Morgantown for the others.
---
I would very much appreciate it if Bethesda decides to add this into one of their updates soon. It would help with the pioneer quests a ton. Either way, Bethesda... keep up the great work!
---
Being able to download a CSV of my dude with all statistics, inventory, and  known things would allow people to make some bad ass things, it would be amazing 
---
Or API access and  people could make their own companion apps.
---
People are able to find him pretty consistently by server hopping wavy willards. He is leaning on the first car to the right in the carpark. It's will only cost the initial fast travel cost and only took me 5-10 minutes.
---
we should not have to eat a huge chunk of budget to try and retarget enemies to avoid them hurting our machines. it is *not* unreasonable for a machine to store data in case it gets destroyed at the very least.
---
I understand things spawning when anyone to camp but it's obnoxious. I had to relocate one camp in particular because everytime I came home or anyone came to visit radtoads would spawn into my foundations. it didn't matter what turrets I put up they never killed a single radtoad. I can't even imagine the headache if I had a shop there - this was home to me in this game and I miss it and wish I could build there again but constantly spawning enemies anytime a travel triggers ...when you can't even target them needs to be fixed. 
---
since traveling is a big thing now with player vending I don't think it's unreasonable for Bethesda to actually stop them spawning every single time a person visits. I didn't  even know this happened until I read this here. I feel like an asshole now knowing I have gone to a camp checked stock and left without knowing something spawned in behind me and could have wrecked their camp. I removed my turrets so I can't be griefed by wanted players (I heard turrets attack wanted players and if they shoot then your camp can be destroyed) so now I know things spawn in when anyone comes to shop.  :/
---
This is helpful, thanks!
---
Speaking of poison, has it been buffed? I've had a lot of poison from enemies I would never expect it. I usually keep at least one poisoner's armor piece to offset it, but I don't expect a glowing mirelurk or gulper to poison me. I don't remember that ever happening before
---
You mean is your perception skewed somehow? Yes. Is your disingenuous question actually meant to insult the game somehow? Yes.
---
Thanks!!
---
Frick 😂
---
Maybe is has to be powered
---
*Laughs in And Stay Back!*
---
I was selling my stuff to a vendor today when i noticed he had 700 frag grenades.
---
But people will downvote you to hell if you point it out. Bethesda can do no wrong.
---
Thanks all
---
But how?
---
Abbies bunker
---
On pc, no such thing as capture previous 5 minutes. Also that wouldn't help if you put them up for sale 2 hours ago anytime prior to that 5 minutes.
---
No one ks saying there aren't ui bugs as well. Just that therr is also a bug causing things to only sell for 1/3 the listed price.
---
Ive been dying for new weapon skins i want a marine armor skin more than anything its like excavator armor all over again
---
It's so bad the ghouls don't even stand up to fight me, they just slide along the ground, then continue to hurt me after I've gotten the exp for killing them. I even had one of the bodies stand up on a fire hydrant. I snapped a pic giving him a shoulder ride
---
Yeah it’s hard to tell if certain ones are bugged for certain people but medic, herpetologist, Leatherworker and musician are an all around a no go. I haven’t had anyone else confirm Chemist yet for me but I can’t get the wolf to pop. I’m done with all the rest.
---
Nope, they're wrong. It's a UI bug
---
Hell yea and dont release 1 at a time we want 5 at a time
---
I am getting that golden knife the second it comes out...
---
I don't think it's worth it, especially since you need to keep the x-01 parts in your stash until they sell... Can you really spare that much stash space?
---
The only way you'll be able to make money like this is if you advertise yourself on discord servers/reddit and let people know that you can craft those mods. 
---
As for price i don't really know. If you go the vending machine you'll need to take into account the junk you used while crafting the legs/torso too. If you craft the parts on demand the buyer can supply the materials but you won't be able to ask for too much that way..
---
Personally i wouldn't buy jetpacks/shocks at all. If i need to carry stuff i have my excavator set, heck, the standard unmodded excavator set gives you as much carry weight as a modded x-01. When you add shocks to your excavator you already have way more carry weight that X-01 will ever have. The jetpack is just a gimmick mod.
---
You would have a friend test it out.
---
Again, OP says this happens every single time.
---
Shouldn't be too hard to show actual inventory differences.
---
I guess if you power its corresponding power plant, or try taking the photo inside the fence or of a different sub station
---
yeah, holy crap
---
I woulda tried that! Oh well, it's gone now
---
I've definitely seen them before. It was right after survival mode came out and I saw one by deathclaw island
---
Take my downvote you not so good sir
---
yea but it sounds like our situation is different you actually had the quest start normal talking to the robot at the camp he gave you the scout outfit , frog jar, frog habitat  unlockable right?
---
Interestingly, when I get a melee no-hit while sneaking, I still see the notification that I'm sneak attacking for 2x damage.
---
Shh guys, show some mercy towards this Indy company, oh wait, they just code like one Feel free to not hold back
---
Thanks friend, if I were to try the same thing on something that IS able to be tamed, will I have the tame option instead of pacify or do I need to do something else?
---
Someone datamined quite a while back that gold and silver/chrome skins are coming for the handmade, no idea when though
---
A new marine skin would be nice, that armor has not received any cosmetic love yet, other armors you can at least add shadowed or polished or bos and it changes the look of you don’t have an atomic shop skin. And along with them they need to scout armor to the legendary loot pool.
---
Your correct but the statement you're making about how many hours people have played is irrelevant. It all depends on those who played prior to the patch or that were lucky enough to trade with another player for them.
---
You actually need to do it for one of the Possum Badges. :) Happy blowing and forever upwards travelers.
---
Saw one for 100 caps yesterday and wanted to buy it to resell it for 1000
---
Rounding seems to be a thing here. I sell my plans for round amounts, always ending in 5 or 0. A 55 cap plan will sometimes give me 49, sometimes for 50. I sell my gunpowder for 1 cap each and it gives roughly 90% of what sold. Just be careful of the UI bugs, it will display that somebody bought whatever quantity you have in the machine instead of what they actually bought, but you will get the proper amount of caps
---
Oh wow, loving that, great job!!
---
Hey, OP what's your GT? If this is happening everytime, it should be easy to prove. And I'd be more than happy to ensure you receive the correct amount of caps.
---
No, it’s originally from Tron.
---
I have so many of these “millennial moments”. The worst one was having to explain to a disbelieving young woman that no, Silver Springs was not originally done by the Dixie Chicks. Fleetwood Mac didn’t “remake” it from them.
---
Legendary scout armor is coming soon apparently after the purveyor screenshots you can see it listed
---
Well, thank you for giving the head’s up.
---
Ah right ty
---
Most people play solo and don't have capture software. You keep ignoring that. Nowhere else does bug reports require video evidence. You are asking for way too much. It isn't the players jobs to be bug testers for Bethesda. 
---
I mean hell by that rate you could test it yourself and take video and disprove it, if you're so sure thjs bug doesn't exist.
---
Well if a thousand of them have been duped they could release and I would say at least one person would buy atoms to be able to unlock the skin for theirs.
---
Ty
---
That would actually be more not less lol!
---
EDIT idk if its just me but I feel like my posts seem like I’m making fun of you, I’m not.
---
lol yeah I've been seeing so many TSE reduced weight Tesla rifles for sale its ridiculous.  also bloodied power fists with swing speed +1 Str.
---
Perfect! Thank you! 😎👍
---
Great about time, hope they add the plans for modding it too.
---
All about just finding the right buyer.  That said, personally, I’d sell it for maybe 250-400. Lmg has faster rof therefor more healing speed. 50 cal is kinda slow firing
---
This is me.
---
Why do I even try and do maths lol?
---
Same here i killed around 20 and not a one droped. Ridiculous.
---
Hopefully we can only hope tho to bad its coming Thursday and not tuesday
---
They have been in the pond near the snake on the map for awhile for me
---
That's wrong though. I sell my gunpowder for 1 cap each and get 90% of what they bought (450 caps for 500 gp). The game seems to round your cap amount, sometimes a 55 cap plan will give me 49 caps and sometimes 50 caps.
---
Cringe
---
Nope, there is currently a bug as well causing people to get only 1/3 the caps they were supposed to. Here, even has video showing it:  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnme68/bethesda_something_is_utterly_wrong_with_your_math/
---
Pretty sure it is just display bug. The correct amount of caps are transferred, it’s just not shown correctly.
---
Yes. You only have to strip it the first time, once you get into the armor, you own it. After you own it, it will automatically collect itself into your inventory after sitting idle for 60 seconds (or maybe a little longer, I forget the exact timer.)
---
Yeah I got 15 strength
---
No it isn't, there is another bug that only gives you roughly 1/3 the caps. This is on top of the known UI bug as well:  https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bnme68/bethesda_something_is_utterly_wrong_with_your_math/
---
Not sure if you did that intentionally, but it's lucky that you did. The game has some really good quest rewards, including weapons with legendary effects that are not yet available as drops. The quest reward level depends on your level, so if you do them after 50 then all your rewards will be max level. I'm sitting on a level 40 perfect storm (10mm smg with incendiary rounds) that really upsets me every time I look at it
---
lmao, then how was this exchange any different. If you'd been on the same platform you would've used a vehicle besides the game itself for in game progression.
---
Oh, I would be so glad to be proven wrong on that point. Can others confirm this?
---
Do one event: campfire tales. Use tesla. Loot everything after event ends, now you are ready to finnis daily quest too.
---
That person is wrong too. People are not buying as much as he/she thinks they are. I've sold hundreds of plans and stacks of ammo/gunpowder, it has never even once cheated me out of anything other than a cap or two due to rounding, and that cap is then "given back" later when it rounds a future sale. The bug is that it shows you an incorrect amount sold in the top left of the screen, you have to go back to your vending machine to see how much was actually bought
---
Bulking doesnt save space only with aluminum and lead, people think its losing weight because they dont account for the plastic theyre losing in order to make the bulk
---
Correct.
---
A mod with what? You mean like to visualise these maps? Cause honestly at that point it's basically hacking if you ask me
---
I feel the pain. The other day I found a plan for a t51 limb in a machine, and wouldn't you know it's the one god damn t51 piece i already knew! I still bought it in hopes of trading 1-to-1 but ffs, it was a face slap.
---
What console are you?
---
They bought all 25 stimpacks they had listed for 25 caps each. After the sale zero stimpacks remained and he received only 225 caps... This isn't the known UI bug.
---
It's far more sustained though, you get consistent healing for a very long time with the .50 cal. Your LMG will constantly be disrupted with pretty long reloads after every few seconds. A couple people I talked to who use vampire's a lot all said the .50 cal is much better than the LMG
---
PC
---
Do you still need those mutation serums?
---
Any quest important locked terminal will be 0. Or should be I believe.
---
Only fuck... I almost had a heart attack, thankfully, i'm not American, it's not today for us.
---
TSE Assault rifle. Listed 5000, got 4500. No problems there. (No, I didn't undersell it. It was only level 30.)
---
Oh that would explain the existence of it, thought it was some random easter egg.
---
I’ve completed railroad, backpacker, and just have a few fertilizer left to craft for gardener.
---
Or do the tea pot event if the campfire event does not proc and vise versa.
---
I think by top of the world station
---
This would be fine, I personally don't mind being downed, and don't start spamming the help thing until around 15 second mark. I'd be ok if everyone followed your advice here.
---
Not about US taxes. Rich people and companies get away with paying very little or nothing and everybody else bears the burden. Very, very little of the resulting revenue is spent on improving anything. Infrastructure is failing, medical bankruptcy is the single most common form of bankruptcy, there is an opioid crisis, public education is criminally under funded, the military budget is over 700 billion and the US continues to separate parents from children at the border for absolutely no reason. 
---
Saying there are pros and cons is ignorant.
---
The numbers been on there for quite awhile now. I used to have my camp right by it and was happy to see an actual number on it.
---
Kind of a necro post, but if anyone else has stumbled across this I tamed a molerate with just animal friend 3.
---
The post never says they were all gone at the same time. I guarantee you if the person was at their camp and checking the machines after each sale, there would be no issue. 225 caps was for 10 stimpaks. Somebody bought 10 of the 25 stimpaks.
---
Damn, if I'm Xbox I was gonna check if I had extras, and if not, help build them at your camp. I have no recollection of where I got the plans though:/
---
Yes, now you are keeper and you have to answer this type of posts ok?
---
(For you) no it’s not worth it (for everyone else in the world but you) yes it’s an absolute fun time!
---
Don’t put anything that weighs less on your character in your stash, e.g if your using martial artist for the extra swing speed your melee weapons will also weigh less so don’t put them in your stash, also aid items if your using thru hiker or travelling pharmacy don’t put aid in your stash, stimpacks etc will eat up your stash space. Don’t keep more black titanium springs or gears in your stash either as they are quite weighty.  I keep 100 of stuff I regularly use, 50 of crystal, gold, silver, fibreglass, asbestos that kind of thing and just horde ballistic fibre.
---
Yes it is. I’m on an original one too and it runs fine. There’s still stuttering but the overall performance is much improved.
---
I had my vendor destroyed once, I didn't have to reprice the items... Considering it didn't happen to me, I think that may be a bug you're having.
---
I’ve done archaeologist, atomic fan, backpacker, gardener, miner, photographer, rail enthusiast and roboticist.. one away from the leather one.. damn deathclaw hides ha..
---
Be careful at AWOL those gutsy will mess you up
---
I didn't know so many logical fallacies could exist within so few sentences.
---
I'll be more than happy to show you, once this never-ending drive home actually ends. 
---
Should be within the next three hours.
---
what is with this weird hardon lately for laser weapons though?
---
like really
---
That is a relief, thank you. I updated my post accordingly.
---
Honestly I'd have to say no it isn't.  Performance has improved but the whole thing is just a tiring  treadmill of shooting and looting.
---
I’m most likely to visit if there’s lots of plans. I’m most likely to buy if they’re cheap. I run my shop on the same logic.
---
Went there today, it's Vault 51 now.
---
Is the vault tec laser rifle skin gone from the atom shop? I'm using it, it's pretty cool. I believe preorders also got a unique skin for it
---
Saw the fish at launch when looking around the sunken structure by the Nuka cola plant.
---
For gardener, what is the garden pot thing? Is it a junk we can pick up?
---
695 likes and 70+ comments tells me that I’m not the only one :)
---
Whoopdi Doo. I'm trying to be a nice person.
---
I got two Perfectly preserved pies set at 3,000 caps each. Thats more than I sell the marsupial serum for.
---
I've seen this happen a few times. No matter what I'm doing I stop to help. Happened once just north of whitespring during a nuke. I dropped the 3 star i was killing and went to the homes defense. No sense in letting someone elses base die when I can help.
---
Think there are a couple 0 and 3s in the power plants.
---
I love these posts! I love the game personally. As for whether you should get back into I have no clue, if your playing something else then great if you want to give it another go awesome. Try it and decided. What's the worst that can happen? You are entertained for a few hours till you decide? Not a tough choice imo
---
What are legacy weapons? AM I FALLING BEHIND AGAIN? DID BETH ADD NEW SHIT?
---
Let's go here!
---
"No."
---
What do you mean by 'legacy' weapon? I've been away from this sub and fo76 for a few weeks. Did I miss something? 
---
I'm guessing a patch brought back duping, but not sure what a legacy weapon is.
---
I think they got removed or replaced accidentally.
---
This is also happening to shotguns.
---
Deep pocketed armor plans sell very well. Others that are only found out in the wild sell nicely too. I believe many high level players just buy any plans they don't know yet, unless they are horrendously overpriced. Marine armor plans and marine wetsuit/helmet plans also sell quickly. Plans for popular weapons like the lever action, handmade, etc for learning plans are also very valuable
---
i knew that actually, i didnt realize thatthe challenges were giving me merit badges actually. Im still just on tadpole ones. I need to milk 5 more cows
---
I've had vending machines get destroyed. I had a hard time getting it rebuilt, I couldn't just walk up and press e to repair like I could other structures. I had to jump into build mode and repair from there. It didn't make me reprice anything. How are you rebuilding your machines? Maybe it's just bugged atm.
---
Pretty sure the vendor bot in whitesprings that sells all the furniture plans has them
---
But isn't Denmark like one of the best places to live? The standard of happiness is exceedingly high, and the country doesn't have any infrastructure issues or debt.
---
Well I guess my knowledge got improved. Hands down. 
---
I didn’t mean to be ignorant or play the victim. 
---
I know we in Denmark are lucky and many people suffer. 
---
I’m sorry bro.
---
And you are totally correct. 
---
Just wanted to make a fun statement to the fact the game took more taxes
---
Any explosive energy weapon that was removed from the drop list ages ago, so you can't get them in game anymore.
---
Is it possible to put a silencer on a lever action? Been scrapping them for ages and never unlocked it.
---
Yep, I think I picked one up at the agriculture center
---
I could ask FB to give input if you'd like?
---
We're going to have to agree to disagree that the base building problems are minor! My issue with the vending is not fair prices, but that the prices a lot of people set are charity, and they all admit as much. I want to struggle a bit in this wasteland, but the community seems dead-set against that.
---
My 219 character has same problem,  i checked the website and its a known issue and there's nothing you can do to fix it.  They suggest waiting 24 hours then try again or make a new character until they get it sorted.
---
They survived the apocalypse. Hell they didn't just survive, they got stronger. Never underestimate the little fuckers. The lvl 300 guy just has the experience to know that.
---
15 events and 0 badges lol
---
That's the one by the skeleton on a bike, right? That one's the junk version, can't be used for cooking.
---
I too would love human npcs but I dont think you can say 90% of the community hates pvp, seems like a pretty made up percentage
---
Hope this helps
---
Damn these were a thing? I heard rumors in Morgantown about exploding lasers. Bullshit, I thought. I stand corrected
---
How do you repair your vending machines?
---
We are in fact very lucky in Denmark. 
---
I didn’t mean to place myself in any role of a victim or be ignorant at all towards u guys!
---
I was just trying to make a fun statement towards that the game was taking a bit more tax than said.
---
I would start with fixing the challenges that are broken too. I can't complete the musician badge at all.
---
I believe it still might be in the Vault Tec package, but I couldn’t imagine a lot of people bought that entire package. I haven’t seen a single person with anything Vault Tec as far as weapons and armor. Ugly IMO
---
You should see my neighborhood.
---
You win it’s fucked up for you. I’ll stop caring because I don’t have this problem. Even if I did I’d understand and adjust the situation so it wasn’t a problem. But I’m logical what do I know.
---
Yeah old news its the new update coming
---
also the responder bots should sell them too
---
You'll be seeing a lot more of them now, overnight they've multiplied on the thousands I'm guessing.
---
Serums delivered and the trade is complete. Thank you for your purchase. Enjoy your mutations!
---
I'm not sure if you are aware, but there are tons of F76 mods for PC and nobody has been banned for using them. Nexus has moderators that decide if a mod gives a player an advantage over others in PvP and removes mods on the site that do. This is what Bethesda has said about them: https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/44429/~/can-i-use-mods-or-other-third-party-programs-with-fallout-76%3F Notice how they never said that they will ban people for using them, only that they are currently not supported and that they might make the game not function properly. There are already a couple of map mods on Nexus and they are pretty popular. A lot of people would love to see map mods of your work.
---
I had a couple of half walls that wouldn’t delete, attached to a roof. Gave up and stored everything with a tear down. The fucking floating half walls, unattached to anything, still wouldn’t delete.
---
I had my husband leave our team, and shoot them until they were destroyed. It let me scrap them after that. It makes no sense, but it worked. Maybe try that?
---
The ones I did that arent broken are Archery, Athletic, and Swimming.
---
Archery - The hardest part was the shooting test. I had to do it several times before I was able to complete it. I had one target that had 50+ bolts in it.
---
Athletic - Peice of cake on my 14 strength character with a lvl 3 action boy perk card equipped. (That last course at Sunnytop Ski lanes was a deathtrap)
---
Swimming - Probably the most complex one to do, Revive and Ally in water. I teamed up with another player who was stuck doing the same thing. He jumped off the slide at wavy willards water park and into the pool below. I revived him. I tried the same thing, I died. I ended up battling a mirelurk queen down south where you have to do the swimming test and got crit injured underwater. He revived me.
---
I had a stack of plasma cores that I had priced at like 2 caps each finally sold. Thank you and my stash thanks you.
---
Oh got it. So have they recently been duped and now flooding the market? Or do you think it is just old stock that some users decided to get rid of?
---
I’m playing on an old day one edition Xbox and I don’t have any problems really
---
So, sort of like when people thought they were losing ammunition when picking items up, but in reality, it was just announcing ammunition they'd shot previously for some reason?
---
I kept server hopping but I never found them
---
To be fair I've got close to 500 frag grenades saved up from collecting and crafting them. Slowly turning g them all into mIRVs
---
Ooh okay lol. I was picturing all of these people being taxed so heavily that they can't even afford anything while the government leaders are driving around in rolls royces lmao. Either way. Have a good day friend!
---
Massive new wave of duping last couple days. And I mean MASSIVE!
---
I think it's a great time to hop back in. I've personally enjoyed it since launch, however at the moment I  think there's a bunch of extra stuff to do. I always find something to do between events and grinding, but with the scout missions and player vending there's a hell of a lot more to do than at release.
---
Damn. Well, I guess my serums are worthless again lol.
---
Fatality
---
Do you have a link of the issue page?
---
Yeah. Luckly I didn't scrap junk after I got done with the Uranium fever event. (I was fixing to fast travel to Dolly Sods when I seen Uranium fever was going on.)
---
I doubt it. You can farm 3* legendary enemies pretty easily. The problem is that the majority of rolls are not worth your time. The vendor isn't going to change that unless they change the odds of rarer effects. Also, new weapons are being introduced from the vendor that were previously not possible to get as legendary drops - those will be the big ticket items people are looking for. I'm hoping it works like a regular store, that 25% or so of what you spend at the vendor will be refunded as scrip credit to the machines so you can keep spending and selling for longer. 150 is already a bit low for people who get lucky with a couple 3* drops a day
---
I llay on a day one and it runs perfectly....i do also use a external ssd.
---
Yeah probably, I think they've sorted it now patch wise but will take some time for it to settle down again.
---
Unnecessary. The existing power armor mods are already like adding legendary effects to power armor. Many of them are basically duplicates of existing effects. Stealth boy, increase special stats, increase VATS accuracy, add carry weight, reduce AP cost, AP refresh, etc. Then you have stuff like targeting HUD, emergency protocols, and jet pack which are exclusive to power armor.
---
A radroach can be found in the gym in flatwoods or in the upstairs bathroom in mama doches.
---
Thank you! This is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for.
---
[Is this worth buying or coming back to - the definitive answer is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/)
---
73% tax, holy! Maybe they aimed for 76% tax to make the game more immersive?
---
ah, didnt know they added the numbers that long ago
---
I disagree, as this is currently the easiest way to destroy player bases.
---
Either bring back a non-roundabout way to do base damage at some consequence, or leave the system as it currently is.
---
Sorry that the facts are an insult to you.
---
I just tested it by picking someone's lock and attacking their camp.  I couldn't damage it, even with my pacifist flag turned off.
---
The map shows about 6-7 stimpacks located at WV Lumber Co, but when I searched there I didn't find any. Does anyone know where they might be?
---
The risk is the fact that people will put their camp there, there is a hole by the whitespring in a rock cliff that goes in the mountain and it’s basically that but on a bigger scale. It’s also not the easiest to get into.
---
tesla has a shotgun barrel attachment, so it can be as overpowered as tse shotguns. It has much less spread so it's possibly even better now after the update. 
---
Also, I keep seeing this around. Patch 5 (or was it 6?) said very clearly that explosive energy weapons are being removed from the pool only temporarily until they get adjusted. Unless bethesda goes back on their word (again), these are going to be returning soon
---
Common plans (like metal bed) I sell at like 1 cap each. More complex and rarer plans I sell for more.
---
Generally my plans dont go over 30 caps unless its something like a serum recipe.
---
Been looking for crossbow plans for a while. Help a brother out.
---
Thing is - to do that you'd take data out the game (my maps) then put it back in again (this mod)
---
Why not just cut the middleman and directly highlight entities in the game world? And that's why we come across the grey area of unfair advantages
---
This was datamined when nuka shine came out, so 2 months ago.
---
Ok 👍 i assumed it was like challenging to pvp if picking lock. Guess thats cleared up now
---
That would certainly help. It's so hard to keep track of actual gains when there is no sales log, and people are buying in quick succession. ;-)
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/46524/kw/Server%20disconnected%20
---
Did you forget about the state sales tax, county sales tax, vendor registration tax, vending machine authorization tax, federal tax, and all local city taxes. Oh can't forget the advertisement tax to advertise your business and then the luxury tax of having customers be able to fast travel to your camp (excluding the customer fee paid to use fast travel.)
---
Duped handmades and explosive lasers.
---
Regularly bulk and sell the junk, leaving only a bulk or two of each.  Rare things like springs and screws hold a few more.  Junk is everywhere, not need to hold it.  In fact, almost everything is replaceable in this game.  
---
Also, I'm a sniper, so I don't go through.much ammo, so no need to hold.much.  I only have the Blade, a handmade, hunting rifle, and 2 Dragons.  Everything else.gets scrapped.
---
Figure out what aid items you actually use, the sell all the rest except for one or two.
---
It's hard to overcome the hoard temptation, but once you can say no, things get easier.

This is a pretty good answer to all these questions
---
Thank you, while this fucking sucks atleast i know its a known issue
---
If you want to destroy bases go to survival servers. Assholes now have a home to go and do asshole things.
---
Lmao what an argument, smh bro just stop, link your source tho
---
Appa what?
---
You gotta loot as many items as fast as you can press the button. This happens to me all the time.
---
We don't know. It will probably be limited just by the amount of scrip you can get. I'm hoping that spending scrip at the store will return some of that back into the machines (like buying at a vendor gives them some money) so you can go for longer, but worst case scenario you can spend 1000 that you have and then sell back some of what you got for 150 and spend that as well
---
Todd broke his promise again.
---
Buy them off the 76bazaar reddit sub instead, they half price .. should be going between 4-5k.

Howdy, neighbor.

My house is on a flat street by WV standards.  Which means it's an incline.

I've been maining a TSE laser for a very long time, it dropped for me just after beta. Especially since the durability buff, it's an amazingly good weapon and very ammo efficient. Shame the dupers have ruined the value of mine, but I was never going to sell it anyway, so...
---
This is Atom’s work.  Bless you sir/madam!
---
Fun to guess without zooming what the bleak spots are with no flux.  Golf course was easy.
---
Oh yooou 😎👉👉
---
welch station, up the hill to the right of the station if you're looking at it.  there's a bbq shack up there.  as well as a cat.
---
Which is limited to 1 per limb compared to 3, WHICH you can also get carry weight on all limbs by pocketing or deep pocketing on top of the legendary effects! Also AP refresh on certain limbs. I’m not saying the power armor doesn’t have perks, obviously it does. That’s all I use, I’m saying it needs to catch up to par to regular armor because there’s no reason I should lose PvP every time just because of the different type of armor that either of us are wearing. Level them out, along with the playing field.
---
yea well as i'm sure you read mine skipped all of that because i started it a month early so my problem I doubt will be a simple fix
---
Awesome! I wanted to nuke somewhere for fluorescent yesterday that wasn't one of the usual spots.  This helps out so much.
---
thats false the only thing that gives a reduced weight bulking is aluminum and lead
---
Can I ask why people keep calling it legacy? Did all those traders forget that the patch notes said explosive energy weapons are being removed only temporarily until they get adjusted?
---
I always pass it solo. When random people show up it is more like a 50% pass rate. Normally fail because someone is standing on the fire or kills something that lands in the fire so I can't add kindling.
---
Haven't done swimming myself, I went for cooking.
---
If it’s able to be tamed you see two choices “tame” or “pacify” in a box that asks if you want to send the animal to your CAMP. 
---
It can take over an hour for it to show up if your CAMP is a long away from the capture spot. 
---
FYI, my friend and I tamed Deathclaws a before the newest patch. Yesterday we were in her house crafting, when we went outside, her’s was dead. Nothing attacked it. 
---
We’ll see if mine randomly dies now that it’s not an “animal”....not sure if we can tame these anymore.
---
Using “Animal Friend” level 3 only.
---
I always check for cheap plans
---
You on PS4? Saw someone on PS4 with that
---
Well I didn't mean to insinuate that **just** you are having the bug, just that it's a bug that you do have :). That being said if you would have replied to my other comment maybe the way you repaired it is bugged. There are two ways, but one of them was giving me issues, in that I was having a hard time getting the press e to repair/rebuild thing to pop up so I went into build mode and repaired it from there. I didn't have to reprice anything that way. Is that how you repaired yours? This needs testing, if repairing this way circumvents repricing issue, then it'll make lots of lives easier.
---
Wow that's higher than my x01 resistances and carrying weight. What build are you using?
---
Anything except the syringer is viable lol
---
I had to redo my camp for the same reason.  I did find that floating/warning on some things went away.  Like the system is doing it the old way, and after awhile it realizes there’s a new way.  Fast traveling away and back always reset it.  Vault/my camp for free.
---
I agree with what others have said, took my original when I was visiting friends and it played just fine. Maybe do a cache reset and/or reinstall and see if it improves, but should work fine. Could be something else on your XB, not saying you not having issues and we believe your claims, but in general should run just fine.
---
Yeah totally blows, was kinda freaking out at first. Being low level with nothing is kinda depressing lol
---
If you can get a shot on an enemy, You will get a loot drop. Even on legendaries.
---
I found mine at the crossbow range at the scout camp
---
How much are deep pocketed plans going for? I have a bunch for a variety of armor types. I was thinking 500 since it's about half of what they cost at vendors but I haven't seen what other people are selling for.
---
Oh, that's probably what frog eye is...
---
I play like a foot then 🤓 I won it alone once with the wendigo, it's easy enough, but the bugs uuuuuuggghhh
---
Nah it isn’t as fun anymore
---
Could someone translate this please?
---
Yeah I always go to the repair all option to fix stuff. I’m not sure what’s going on but it’s getting obnoxious lol.
---
It's intersting - you have the AshHeap cause it's just dead, then the WS course and Wade Airport - however there are some literal just blank areas which I think they straight up missed.
---
If you can't use the search function to find the dozens of posts just like this one, probably not.
---
To Bethesda
---
Bethesda's response to glitches is so slow that it can not be reversed.
---
Remove all weapons of the same ID that exist in large numbers from being a glitch item.
---
You should clean the market leaving only the real thing.
---
It's equal if everyone has the same chance of losing items.
---
You should get pus.
---
I price it somewhere around there. The base price is I think 700 or so? I charge around 70-80% of that depending on what it's for (i.e more for marine armor than for trapper armor)
---
Some people just want to see the world burn unfortunately.
---
As far as I'm concerned, Bethesda should have tools that tell them who has duplicated items and then permanently ban their IP/lock their account
---
You could check out the welcome to Grafton sign,  north of town I believe.
---
I drop a lot if nukes. Usually like 3 a day when im farming. I've been burnt by other players taking advantage of my nuking so much by them one shotting everything. It got super frustrating awhile ago. At this point, if I launch the nuke im not using any etiquette in a nuke zone. 
---
I put in the time and resources to do it so I don't care if anyone else tags. I'll once shot anything all day.
---
HOWEVER,  if someone else launched it,  I'll just tag stuff with my buzzblade and make sure everyone gets a chance.
---
I had a guy last night just killing the mole miners with what looks to be an AK-47 that shoots explosive bullets. I would have asked him where he got the gun from but he didn't have a headset plugged in.
---
BTW Where can I acquire such gun from?
---
I did archer, hunter, and athelete
---
Let's also not forget to mention the grindy DLC that was released .. I wish there was something else I enjoyed playing, I would be gone in a flash, but for now will continue the grind.
---
Us Free States folks tried to warn you guys about this, but nooooo you trust Vault Tec/Enclave.  I’ve personally been sent photos of the dead Whitespring’s Free States vendor as a warning to keep quiet about this.  Soon there will just be me and Wallace warning you all, and when it’s too late, we won’t be around to help you!
---
Hold on, someone’s at the door....
---
Don't you just learn it from looting fox meat?
---
Cheap plans and outfits (under 100c), mutation serums under 250c (can sell to vendor for a profit), ammo for 1c each, flux under 100c all sell well for me.
---
This is kind of a 'necro' but I wanted to leave a thanks here because I found your post most helpful.
---
This is the last teddy I needed for one of the possum badge challenges.
---
I was basically going to say this. I would like to see an offer system but may be limited to one or two offers a day so people can't spam you constantly.  Also if there was an offer system, may be have the option to turn it off or set a threshold to avoid people offering really low amounts.
---
I see your point, but there are already many mods that can be said to give PvE advantages, some more than others. In my opinion, map mods are the same as looking at a map from another monitor or from your phone, so they aren't considered cheats to me.
---
I'm assuming you don't want to see mods of your maps, but will you give me your permission to upload mods with your maps? I will respect whatever your decision is.
---
Yeah I just dont even buy it if i cant see the other effects. Unless it's super cheap.
---
Yeah it's annoying but the only thing you can really do is stick at it.
---
I posted about this a couple days ago, but the individual challenges need to be trackable. Annoying, but not hard to count when you get 50 kills with a crossbow, without going through several menus.
---
I have a headcanon running that for a very brief time, after the war West Virginia (with us at the helm) was this weird civilisation where half of its former Vault Dwelling populace tried real hard to turn it into a utopia, while the other half, driven mad by the world they had stepped into, decided it had to be obliterated by nuclear fire.
---
Interesting. Do you know which effect is negated? As an example, for my pieces with assassins sentinel, will the assassins effect or the sentinel effect work? Or does the sentinel negate the assassins when it procs?
---
My friend has been using this to his advantage. His base is near New Gad, and people make the scorched and super mutants spawn at the boats and huts.  His turrets take em out and he gets constant free loot through doing so. 
---
Surprised they didn't realize this could potentially be an issue
---
Ive gotten some two star armor peices from UF event.
---
Wow thank you I appreciate it pm me :D
---
If yes, 3foxes are at BBQ shack where free states event starts.
---
I think I found one surrounded by radroaches on the highway going north towards the civil war reenactment camp, had a hardened sniper rifle and a duffel bag with prewar money and chems or something.
---
I assumed it was just world flavor.
---
When you make it up there can you just throw a drone cannon back to earth? I’ll catch it.
---
It's all RNG. I've got over 300 hours in and got like one bloodied weapon, then yesterday I got three on consecutive enemies including an explosive combat rifle. It was awesome.
---
Have you tried putting it into an overseer’s stash? I was able to get rid of mine a while ago and that might have been how.
---
Explosive shotgun helps when you get bugs. So does electrically charged mutation.
---
Yep, shooting range at the scout camp (the one in the Toxic Valley) is your best bet. Seen 'em there every time I've visited the camp since the scouting update so with any luck you should find the plans pretty quick.
---
I play on an original XBox One and it runs fine.  A little stuttering here and there if you're just loading in, or if you're in the middle of something like a SBQ fight with a dozen other players.  I can also tell when I load into a new area because there's a sliiiiight hiccup for a second.
---
But overall it runs fine.
---
From previous FO experience, first time I saw a deathclaw in 76, I said a few choice words and tried to run away.  
---
Died.  More than once.
---
I still respect them, but now its more like “Let’s get ready to ruummbllleeeee....”
---
Deathclaws are no longer at the top of the food pyramid - there are things in this game scarier(deadlier) than deathclaws.....
---
Yeah I have been idling at my camp when I have stuff to do around the house lol so far it has worked pretty well.
---
Is it in your vendor ☺ or are you keeping it? 🤔
---
Try repairing them from the build screen. The press and hold V (on pc) screen I mean. I haven't needed to reprice anything that way, so if it also works for someone else, then we have a work around.
---
I've got a i.o.u. beer for 25k and whoever buys it gets beer irl
---
I just want the scorched that are a hundred yards away taking pot shots at my camp until they destroy it to just stop. Their so far I can’t vats them from my camp but yet they constantly shoot it from the roof of thunder mountain. Carry a sniper named ‘varmint rifle” just to keep my camp together.
---
Do we have to have all of the items on us at the same time? Like with stings and things?
---
You'd think after the 3rd time, but nope. Muscle memory.
---
I’ve been selling BOS combat armor plans that are 95 caps and selling them for 500 and they go almost instantly.
---
I figure high level people who don’t know these plans can be found so easily and while I could probably charge more I just want people to get them who don’t have Reddit while making more money to go to others shops at the same time
---
EDIT: same goes for X01 military paint now available  in the enclave bunker for 195 caps. No one has seen it so when they do at your store they’ll buy instantly
---
The error I get is either Nothing is selected (exit the build menu and reenter build mode) or Item needs support (I spam the place button until it eventually goes thru.)
---
What kind of support does it need; Emotional support?
---
If you’re on PS4 I can hook ya up. PM me. :)
---
I don't have these 😔 most of the time I forget to take my tesla rifle too, and as you said I stay next to the fire and bugs keep dying on it. I'm bad at this ahah
---
Also had this problem on PS4 and this is what I did to complete it. If the quest triggers without me being at fort defiance it glitches out and I can't complete it.
---
 I'm max strength with high endurance and agility (I think only 3 PER, 3 CHR, 5 INT, 3 LCK), all deep-pocketed armor, heavy combat torso and heavy leather limbs, and all of the resistance buff mutations. I also use X01 and my carry weight is better than the PA, but I'm  pretty sure my X01 DR is better and if my ER is better it's not by much (I might get refractor though so that could change). I pretty much only use PA for nuke zones, especially now that we have backpacks.
---
I'm charging 500 caps for "crappy" 3 stars. Even though they're actually good for people who just hit 50. Would rather have the caps for them, I've already got enough scrip to be disappointed a few times lol
---
I haven’t but then, I haven’t killed any foxes, so i guess it’s time to hunt
---
Huh. And I just thought my aim was terrible. Oh well. 50 machine gun does more Dps for me than a prime gauss rifle.
---
I’ve done it a few more times solo and it’s so much easier as I know I’m not picking wet kindling. Finally got the s’mores and tent.
---
I did too. Goodbye over encumbered, Hello extra carry weight!
---
Yeah that random encounter came with the Sheepsquatch update. Kinda threw me off, I've never seen a traumatized super mutant before
---
Unless you mean lag, that's just you pressing too fast for the recycle time on that weapon.
---
What’s a good price range for plans? I honestly don’t know how to price anything logically.
---
A simple keyring or card-keeper implementation on the MISC tab from Bethesda would have fixed all that.
---
Exactly! 
---
 If it can't be done in game I don't want any part of it.
---
3rd party programs and sites make lazy developers.
---
 Why spend money and resources developing something in game if players already have something out of game.
---
I am completely opposed to 3rd party lfg or trading sites.  Just my humble opinion
---
Check around in the brotherhood vendor at the whitesprings and Phoenix in Watoga.
---
I just find PA suits and take the cores from them most of the time.
---
Hard to tell at the moment until we know for sure how the legendary vendor works. We have datamined the items it will drop, but we still don't know if rates will be different, whether scrip spent at the merchant goes back into the machines, etc. It could be a double edged sword - 3* "junk" weapons can be better because they are liquid scrip, or they can be worse because of the burden of taking away a large portion of your daily scrip allowance
---
Because no video games have ever leaked real life information. They don't need security.
---
This others gain weight
---
Most of the people I talk to in game and IRL, don't like PvP in a fallout game. But I am aware there is a pool of Fo76 players who just love it. Kudos to them, I wont be playing.
---
Probably no fix, Ethernet, good internet, port forwarded etc, such is life.
---
I price 50-90% of the base price depending on how popular it is. For plans that are not available from vendors (marine wetsuit, many special receivers/scopes, etc) I find a price that seems fair, since usually they default to a base value of 50, which is often way too low for them.
---
The lack of vegetation in the ash heap is concerning yet understandable.
---
Frag grenades are an odd thing to dupe, though. They aren't really worth much, and are already pretty common. I feel like people just tend to pick them up and immediately sell them off, since they probably use better grenades by that point. I could easily see a vendor get up to 700 that way, over time.
---
Good info, ty. How do you manage rads in a nuke zone?
---
It’s like different teams did different regions, and the Savage Divide guys went nuts with Blackberries, while the ash heap guys were trying to be authentic to the region.
---
It would be nice if challenge tracking added something to the UI/map to make it easier to get to undiscovered locations for said challenges.
---
Now this is a real PSA.
---
Yes and yes.  The other day I was fighting one.  Half way through the battle I ran into two others so I was fighting 3.  I did not survive.
---
I thought everyone knew this
---
They don't exist lol. Unfortunately pistols in 76 stink.
---
I think doing it individually would overwhelm the server but splitting the Pioneer Scout badges into a category by itself into a category called called Scout Badges would be awesome!
---
Yes please I don’t want the ghouls to pound down on my face while my character either tries to drink dirty water or get some good rest on a moldy couch.
---
That's no fact check. All they did is say Bethesda is lying then post 0 proof.
---
Good to know, thanks for responding :)
---
I only know those effect no more stack, it was writen in patch notes. That mean full sent+assas no more makes u immortal.
---
This comment needs more upvotes.  You keep 4/5 workshops around where you are and you’ll be nonstop defending and raking in the XP.  I’ve heard people are more aggressive with shops as of late, but I had maybe 1% chance of being bothered when I was leveling.
---
How do you know how many people are playing the game?
---
I can only place 5 turrets so my turret placement has to be very well thought out.
---
I've found that around Morgantown is a great spot, with Low level ferals being the only threat, long empty streets, and available parking space
---
Worth a try! Hadn't heard of that
---
I don't know that it would. The only difference is that you could tag the challenge for tracking. I think that tracking is all client side, so no extra server load.
---
Great map appreciate the work that went into it! 
---
Just a suggestion: I think it would make it easier to spot high yield flux nuking areas if the forest safe zone was left blank.
---
My perfectly preserved pie is 'on sale' for 25k.. I bought an extra one from a sucker for 20 caps, so might as well sell one, although they're essentially priceless.
---
Nothing showing up is good enough
---
Unless you are on the same team and nearby the ghoul when your teammate kills it.  In that case you can loot it but do not get the experience rewarded for killing it.
---
When I do uranium fever event I ask anyone else that shows up to team up with me in case one of those legendary mole miners gets killed without me getting a chance to tag it....
---
I won't be making mods with these, but the maps I made are in the public domain and free so go wild. If you use the map itself just leave the watermark on I suppose.
---
The rectangle of nothingness just West of the Whitespring is really odd too.
---
You still need help?
---
I’m this way too! Runs perfectly fine for me as well.
---
Lol and one of them flings a dead ghoul right at you. Scared the heel out of, those cheeky cunts.
---
Is a 6-month-old opinion piece relevant? I want numbers.
---
Wish I had found your shop before paying 1000 a plan
---
Is that the standard space suit? It looks a bit darker, not sure if it's the lighting though
---
Wow time fly’s lol
---
He doesn't have them. I'll hop this a few times later.
---
Well it's not though, that's my whole point. Sometimes the server takes 10 seconds to give you the little "success" notification. In the window you have no idea if the roll failed and you're wasting your time, or if you're still waiting on the server.
---
I do SBQ runs multiple times a week feel free to add me so I can help you out!
---
Yes that’s pretty much the gist of it. The only other consideration would be if you have enough budget left at your Camp. If you don’t, I guess the game option won’t appear. 
---
I’m not at all expert at taming pets, however. I only did it once and my pet dog/wolf only lived for 45 minutes at my camp before friends of friends accidentally mini nuked him.
---
Yep that would be a really sensible way to do it 👍
---
As flat as the land gets huh
---
Original black xbone, works as fine as any Bethesda game can
---
I thought I might have been the only one with 43 of them cards.... They are a pain to scroll through. I have had them in my inventory since the first day I played the game.
---
I'm like level 18 and I was visiting a camp and at one point, I heard shooting.  Go outside to see a level 90 supermutant master or something just standing there firing at the guy's camp.  I tried to hurt it but it was clear I was going to get demolished if I tried to fight it, so I had to flee :/
---
I do the same
---
Still goes back to the age old question: I bought a duped weapon from a player vendor (unknowingly) should I get in trouble?
---
I know that you cannot sell to vendor bots. Most likely the same.
---
It’s a keeper, especially if you have incisor and martial arts perks.
---
My two favorite class weapons are executioners and vampire.
---
You may find something a bit more effective later....but it’ll definitely work.
---
(There’s also a executioners Bowie knife)
---
I’m melee - my 2 favorites right now are plain (L45) Cultist Dagger and 1* (50) Vampire Switchblade.
---
No qualms about going in solo against a Sheepsquatch or deathclaw with either of them.
---
I use an Executioners rifle for L50 Scorchbeasts...although I am coming to appreciate the AA LMG I recently picked up :)
---
Explosive lasers were pulled from the loot tables a while back because of a bug. So people that have them are making lots of caps treating them as a rare collector's item.
---
Don't forget to take a picture of the fox for the photography badge
---
You're doing gods work
---
Play it and make your own opinion
---
Welcome. The same setup in in the conference room of Garrahan Mining Headquarters too.
---
Lol. Probably a lvl 68 warlord. Those are the toughest ones
---
I tried putting it in my camp vending machine and it was a no go. Must be tied to the player like atom shop items.
---
I asked this yesterday too. I guess the only place is enclave bunker now... SBQ doesn’t drop them anymore
---
Doesn't this happen with every location?
---
I’m at over 24 hours now :( Hopefully they fix it soon.
---
I've never had s problem on the original
---
Its always a shock being mortal again
---
Ive seen both for sale at other's camps so i know they can go in. Try relogging maybe?
---
Aid!
---
If the game was on steam, we'd at least be able to see the steam pop, but otherwise on December 17, 2018 there were roughly 406 players playing on the PS4 at the time.
---
There isn't much practical difference between 50 and 100. Most of us have loads of caps and only need a few plans, so spending 50 or 100 or 200 in a mix for a half dozen us still less than a day of caps.
---
Power armors are significantly underpowered compared to magic armors that can ignore 80% of incoming damage per piece and stackable. On top of that you have weight reduction, chameleon, deep pocket, weightless, and bunch of fancy stuff can be added per piece, and you don’t have to farm fusion cores to keep them running. Few people use power armor in pvp. They made some nice skins for PA but why would people decorate something that’s obviously inferior in a battle. PA is ‘endgame’ stuff only when someone had a bad aim at the fissure site.
---
It would be under aid
---
Whaa? I've got a copy each time I've done the Battle Bot event.
---
Idiot that I am I did this 3 times before I realised. D'oh!
---
Funny, I used that same bow for my badge and then traded it for scrip
---
I’m built in the more on a hill. If you can place a foundation into the hill, you can snap it in place. It doesn’t stick out of the ground depending on depth obviously but it does work
---
I find myself mostly rocking the .44 magnums/revolvers. For 10 mm, you need the extra +30% damage mod. I use a lower the damage resist, the higher damage you do Pipe Bolt-Action pistol with Hazmat suit. It one-shots all the ghouls. I strongly recommend you use the Marisupial serum to jump on objects to prevent you from getting swarmed by enemies. Pistol damage is only good in close to medium range.
---
#falloutseventyshits
---
Don't they tend to go for generators though? Not many working generators outside of player camps.
---
I keep saying it sucks for new players. Imagine being lvl 5 right now and look at the challenges. How many could feasibly be done?
---
Anybody find any specific camp items that seems to be a priority target for enemies? I know they attack turrets, but I'm looking for something to get the melee enemies away from the walls so my roof turrets can lay waste. I've tested a few floor decorations but not very successful.
---

---
Got a bloodied explosive .44 on a character and decided to make a pistol character around it.  5 pieces of unyielding gear of various quality.
---
I also have a 2pt each gun perk/1 pt born survivor for PA time when fighting in groups/queen or whatnot.  Also switch around the luck perks a bit Bc I still haven’t found the optimal luck loadout.
---
I crit every 2-3 shots now, and I’m still working on 3ing all perks (I leveled up this character by 2-pt perking everything, then moving to third hoping to get lucky on packs).
---
I get all mine at harpers ferry. Been selling my duplicates for a fair chunk in cap vending and they sell like hot cakes.
---
It jUst WOrkS!
---
It was in my vendor. Will check later to see if its sold ( I know they do pop ups I don't pay attention)
---
Good instigating weapons are game changers for pve leveling. Such huge resource and time savers.
---
Future proof? Something already nerfed.
---
Absolutely. Best way to do it it's asking a friend to help, that's what I've just done. I'm just "S'more" away to end the cooking badge, shit, took me 3 days
---
It’s decontaminating you, so the jets are strong, that’s why it does the sound
---
BOS events have them rarely as reward.
---
If they're loud that might actually make sense.  But attacking razorgrain?  That's stupid.
---
Do you already have some in your machines? I was selling plasma grenades and wanted to add some more in . I had to take all of them out and replace them, it said the machine was full.
---
Did this get fixed for you? I’m over 24 hours right now.
---
Math...math never changes 😏
---
I didn't, and I'm on PS4 since the game launched!
---
Thanks for the info OP!
---
Was this fixed for you?
---
Watoga has three spawns that are usually T-60. You get the X-01 crafting plans from the archive terminal in the military wing of the Enclave. You also get mods and mod plans from the Enclave for X-01.
---
Hm thanks, I'm level 92 now but I'm kinda new in what it comes to power armor stuff. Like I don't know where to get parts for the, or paints. I've seen people with really nice looking paints
---
Is this still happening to you?
---
Can I get some real sauce for these claims?
---
Dear Bethesda, 
---
Will you actually please just play the game for me while I’m at work ?
---
Still locked out?
---
Before the patch I was buying any light legendaries that were around 100 caps.
---
I literally just came here to post about the instruments.
---
You mean Watoga Civic center?
---
Thanks, friend :)
---
No idea. I know if there's cardboard boxes on top of desks, if you delete the desk the boxes stay floating in air.
---
No, no.... in the real world, if you're stuck in the videogame game industry you're either really passionate about it or you're an utter failure at programming. The latter explains why game companies demand quantity over quality from their employees and is the only, the sole, the single, subdomain of programming that requires programmers to work more even though they cost a lot of money.   
---
In the real world, if you're halfway decent at programming, you get a better job than in videogames within days and the only reason you'd stay in that domain is if you're passionate about it and living in a delusion that there's room for growth in the company. And it really is a delusion, because they more often than not will bring in someone from the outside instead of promoting their better employees, far more easier to replace a manager than a good programmer.
---
Sounds like a deal. I don't run a power armour build but would love to have something decent to take nike zones and queen battles. Thanks
---
Joining
---
I need a sorry emote for when I accidentally aggro the Whitesprings bots. There’s no coming back from that insult.
---
Now if I can only find one lol
---
I agree, but there should be some leniency on this, not one time and banned. Though the percentage is likely very small, there are definitely people out there that didn't mean to dupe. I don't know specfics about the methods because I'd just rather not, but the older methods relied on server crashes, right? I can't even recall the number of a times a server has just crashed on me. In these instances, should there be an ability to inform Bethesda of this and somehow willingly give up whatever was accidentally duped? An honor system sort of thing could at least maybe help prevent innocent players from bans. I'm sure it's a lot of work and I'm oversimplifying things, I'm no coder, I don't make and run games, but there's gotta be something to protect people that were just trying to play the game.
---
Shyeah that would be bad. I'm level 172, so not a lot that lives and breathes in the wasteland causes too much trouble. But these creatures ain't posing for us and it seems you pretty much need to be within melee range for the challenge to pop, aka, getting brutalised by a Yao Guai for example.
---
PIPE REVOLVERS!!!!!!!!!!!! Unless they got patched out, pipe revolvers benefit from rifleman and gunslinger, as they can be made into a rifle but qualify as a pistol. My non legendary pipe revolver does a out 125+ damage, vs my western revolver at 108.
---
Mods are one time use
---
If you’ve got the materials, I can craft it for you.
---
Someone posted a list of items available from the purveyor, it was pretty long. To get your dream Junkie’s Bashing Damage +1 Sobriety handmade it will probably take a while.
---
Also curious not specked yet but was planning on it
---
That'd be a small house.
---
There are few paints ingame i would suggest you to search on youtube. 
---
Also you can buy plans for T series armor in watoga and x-01 in enclave bunker.
---
thanks but am on xbone unfortunately :(
---
It's easy to find, at West-Tek
---
I'm glad there's new content for us higher levels, but the newbies are left in the dust. It was nice when half the challenges were bonkers, and the other half were like collect 50 wood, scrap 5 armor.
---
Nope, not this mod. Bug.
---
You can learn it, then offer modding service.
---
All Clothing has Dr of 1. maybe its just that one sacrifice you have to make to rock a specific look. 
---
Perfect for beserker build tho?!
---
So do I, but unfortunately the only concrete numbers I see here are negatives from downvotes.
---
There is bug, where you learn that mod just from picking plan. This one only plan does that. And cost 8 possum badges.
---
I usually buy mine at 3k-4k, but I honestly never thought about them being duped. I feel pretty dumb for not even considering it...
---
LeBrahmin James
---
You need deposits, not veins.  The pits you place workshop extractors on, not the little one shot nodes.
---
On xb1?
---
Oh bullocks 
---
You’re exactly what I said you are.
---
Yea I've seen it in the Enclave bunker but they're expensive as hell lol
---
You can't mod others backpacks, but i can borrow you this plan so you can mod your bags.
---
Most of them are logical/equate to how you would use it IRL.  
---
FireAxe, Grogonak axe, pick axe, shovel, pole hook, spear are 2 hand
---
Machete, knife, switchblade, hatchet, gauntlet, sword are 1H
---
In general, 2H have higher damage, but are slower - with the right perks, faster but lower Dam weapons are more effective than slower high damage weapons. 
---
For example, 1 hit with an axe (slow) is 114. A switchblade - fast, dam 50, can do 3 hits in the same time frame.
---
Total damage then s 114 for the axe, 150 for the switchblade.
---
- Magazines [10c]
---
- Nuka Colas [10c]
---
- Bobbles [30c]
---
- Max level one stars [100c]
---
- Stims [10c]
---
- Recipes [0c/20c, found/rewarded]
---
- Plans [25c]
---
Like, I don't mind paying for plans if that's the only way to get them, but I don't know if that's this case or if there's another way to get them
---
Yeah, you need something to spend caps on later :D
---
Like a defeated poof sound would be enough, there's countless times I've already walked away too early cause of lag
---
So far I'm still stuck, and of I don't expect to hear anything more from support on the weekend. I'm letting it go 24 hours without even trying to log into that account in case even trying is resetting a counter or timer, so I'll give it another try late tonight to see if it clears out. Here's hoping a patch is inbound on Tuesday in any case.
---
Sent-ass armor is still top and way op, melee is something has never been and will never be nerfed. I’d suggest a hopping bunny with dc gauntlet build.
---
I'd be curious to see an aggregate list of what stuff actually sells for, averaged over the playerbase. Not what people set the price for, but what prices people are actually willing to purchase stuff for. It'd be a neat thing to look at from an economics perspective, although it would have the negative side-effect of effectively setting prices according to the list after that.
---
Z■
---
Sure, what is your PSN?
---
Weird. I primarily use power armor a hardly get stuck
---
I bought probably 200 lbs of crap legendary rolling pins and canes and such, all for under 20 caps each. I bet finding good legendaries in tradebots will be impossible soon. Either at camp vendors, or sold for scrip.
---
You should turn frag grenades to nuka grenades. They are wonderful things.
---
And also from SBQ and imposter sheepsquatch. Lol forgot about that as it is few patches ago old.
---
She have huge chance to drop jetpacks for T-51 and T-60
---
I sold exactly the same weapon for 2k yesterday. It was only a day or two old and sold pretty fast. People get excited when they see bloodied or furious weapons, myself included but I use melee so I was happy to get the stash space.
---
Seems like the community is really anal about anything negative about the game reguardless if it's true or not.
---
I'm in several sales groups as well as a merchants guild. I'll post this there and see if we cant get some data together for ya 🤙
---
I want to! Still shopping for the plans :). I've got a few dozen colas saved up.
---
Because it's based in reality. Some decontamination process use electrostatic solutions to bind to contaminating particles. The charge helps the solution bind particles better.
---
Clean space suit. Probably the lighting.
---
I don’t know if it’s the same bug, but you can also no longer put footlockers under beds, or under weapon workbenches. So the changed something with the collision data.
---
Gosh, imposter sheepsquatch event...I hate that thing, only won it twice, and one of those times server crashed so I didn't get a reward lol
---
After having this happen a few times I’m now like speedy Gonzales on those dead legendaries, I hate when it happens, always seems to be 3 star legendaries for me...
---
Nope. Google the patch notes. Use YouTube. Use the reddit search feature. We get like 20 of this exact question a day.
---
No way they have such abilities, unless you’re carrying 3 million pounds of bloodied explosive laser. Actually they probably still can’t even if you do. Just did a quick check on ebay, tons of dupers are making a healthy profit from Bethesda’s incompetence. If they can and have the will to clean up their game, they would have done it already.
---
Ty for posting this
---
Hey I like the ideas of these builds, I was looking at the shotgun stealth build it looks like tons of fun!
---
 I was gonna ask what mutations for that build and also what  build do you personally use (mutations included) 
---
Also was thinking on loading up on weight reduction perks and being a sorta merchant
---
No more upvotes on this comment guys; we’ve nailed it!
---
Yeah when they added it and then you go to the map UI and only see titles and you have to go into your challenge UI anyway, what's the point xD  
---
If there's subgroups into the challenges, we should be able to add them individually.
---
Thanks for this. I am tired of writing it :D
---
Yes, one on the roof, one by the crashed vert, and another not far away.
---
No need to be so rude; I was asking a question, and a polite one at that.
---
My platform is the Xbox. I have Jetpack plans for the T-45 and the T-51. 2000 caps per plan. Look for sleepy4792.
---
Bugs definitely seem to be the hardest things to kill.
---
It's hard to remember how amazing the early game was once you're level bajillion. I keep all of my lvl 10 and under legendaries on me just in case I see a low player. My 2nd playthrough someone gave me a lvl1 auto stim leg, and I wore that thing for about a month before passing it along.
---
whenever I get to the missing camper portion the items are always glitched. I'll collect them without getting credit, then I'll have a quest marker bouncing around real fast. I've never even gotta to finish it
---
Only certain rare spawn areas have animals that can be tamed. Most animals you come across aren't a random spawn. And even when you do find a random spawn location, not all animals that spawn there will be tamable. You pretty much have to find a spot, and just keep checking it until you find an animal to tame. 
---
I've tamed 6-7 things so far, and I've got over 700 hours in game. I've server hopped locations for hours, finally got a tamed creature. Then it died. So be prepared for a little heartbreak.
---
I'm on Ps4 but thanks anyway buddy
---
They do additional damage, not very much, to scorched. Other than that they’re slightly worse than regular laser rifles and mostly used for the green beam factor.
---
 I get a variety pack from WS. 
---
Not that I can really do a “fair” comparison - WS is tho only real farm run I make right now....
---
Been farming it for 50 some levels now - gotten a fair mix of regular, bloodied, assassins, Junkie, and Vampire.
---
Assassins and executioner less frequently.
---
There's a random encounter where they're being attacked by Liberators, and they almost sound scared of the things. It's hilarious.
---
Small but safe.
---
Its just darker in coloration
---
Barbarian, blocker, evasive, serendipity and nerd rage, plus talons, adrenal reaction, incisor etc. you know how glowing ones still spawn for a while after nuke zones end? I keep my hazmat suit on. I rarely die from damage but them rads will get me. My dr is pretty high with no armor at all.  Rad resist not so much
---
Would have been avoided if they used the offered social network APIs on console as well as Steam.
---
That's the only time I pull out the power armor. You can do it in a hazmat, but the lack of DR makes it difficult for ghoul hordes or multiple adds, it's just easier to rely on the inherent RR in PA.
---
Do you have any examples of some spawn areas I could visit?
---
Sounds like you had so much fun doing this regardless of your loss. This put a smile on my face. Thank you for sharing your experience!
---
Don't forget to tend to the campfire while fighting! The event fails when the kindling runs out.
---
Both cases of dodgy programming.
---
I've tried jumping before they hit me but as I hit max height from jumping, they still hit me.
---
I'm not even joking when i say i'm more afraid of a lvl 20 bug with poison attack than of deathclaws
---
Good thing the post you linked didn't say that so you're pulling another number out of your ass huh? Bethesda hasn't posted any numbers for the game. ALSO it wasn't 406 it was 406,795. Meaning thousands. The post used periods instead of commas which is common practice, but if you follow their link that's just them ripping off of a reddit post you can see how many play on PS4.

---
Please, please, take a picture
---
Here's a map of some of the spawn locations. Not everyone will give a tamed creature, as he didn't separate tamables from other animals, like small animals, squirrels, chickens, etc. But at least it gives an idea of where to look.
---

My psn is Kagoru-Rhodes. It's really nice that you're doing this. These challenges are tough lol &lt;3
---
Sure thing!
---
Absolutely this! It would be a significant QOL improvement.
---
Bugs and rats are ate biggest pests in the entire game. Its ridiculous how much damage those tiny bastards can do to you w/o even being in a group.
---
Enemies in the area. If you get hit the timer cancels.
---
You're an idiot.
---
Bethesda will do anything to make a game appear populated, that's why they didn't go on Steam, that's why they won't ever reveal their population, hell, if they were smart they would of disabled trophies too, but of course ps4 users are droolers and don't care.
---
Now buy some more atoms pleb.
---
Same here, kinda annoying
---
its never going to be the main mode.. i wouldnt worry about it..
---
game is way to janky for serious multiplayer pvp...
---
Ah, maybe? Hopefully it'll get fixed soon.
---
Cool!
---
Anyone on Xbox to do that?
---
Fair enough, let's see if in a few days/weeks what will happen, another banwave, and hundreds of people coming here claiming they didn't cheat xD
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
In terms of what’s changed substantially: lots of bug fixes, tons of new content, plasma weapons are a bit better, survival mode added (restrictionless PVP servers), and explosive and two-shot weapons were nerfed.
---
I believe it should be in a conference room near the main entrance lobby area
---
There’s also the issue where you can’t put certain things under the stairs with floors attached. My kitchen in under the stairs and now I can’t place my stove..
---
That's actually a good idea
---
Most are missing the point of this post as with all posts that depict bugs or misinformation even fraud in a game. The developers are making a conscious decision to cheat you period whether it's selling you a broken game or inundating a game with predatory hidden algorithm loot boxes.  As the consumer we need to understand they need us we don't need them we let them in because they bring us enjoyment. We have the power stop settling for mediocre and broken stop buying their crap. That is how you change this. Don't call it a boycott. Just don't buy their next offering... All of a sudden things will change.....
---
the alternative to the timer is finding and killing the enemy or walking far enough away..
---
it is a good thing..
---
Im on xbox. If you give someone the plan and they use it, it disappears and they won't be able to give it back. What you can donis : they give you the pack, you mod it, and return it.
---
Also the word your looking for lend not borrow. "You lend to someone else, they borrow from you."
---
You intention is very kind.
---
Yeah and i feel like poison dmg ignores all kinds of perks and such. As soon as i get hit by poison attacks i need to get a stimpack otherwise i'd die due to a lvl 20 bug
---
well here’s to name a few:
---
- more stash space, 800 now
---
- a bunch of new quests and free dlc, along with a roadmap
---
- another end game boss, could say even tougher than the queen
---
- a new faction “pioneer scouts” and their questline (and challenges)
---
- tons of quality of life improvements
---
- stability and performance is a lot better since launch but still gets laggy from time to time
---
- you can now sell stuff in your camp (and when you do your camp is available as a fast travel point for everyone)
---
- a few bigger nerfs (explosives, shotguns, two shot effect for example)
---
- some buffs (energy weapons, heavy guns)
---
- explosive effect removed from legendary energy weapon drops (pre-patch weapons still exist, those are now legacy weapons)
---
- a new “dungeon” called the burrows, in harpers ferry
---
no way i could list everything but hope this gives a good summary on the highlights
---
There is also a challenge for killing 76 scorched with a crossbow. So I just went round Poseidon and did both challenges at once. As I was tracking the scorched one, I knew where I was with the scout one.
---
Thaaank you!
---
Just a question tho, how the hell do I get the recipe? 🤓
---
Though great, that's so busy at that resolution a heat map would be of more use I think.
---
Decency is way rarer than explosive laser. People bring real world personalities right into the virtual world. If i don’t want to work hard but seek to take advantage of any loophole to make a profit, I’d certainly dupe some game items for real cash.
---
I know that marsupial death jump all too well. Just when I think I’ve got away my body goes limp!
---
At the floating palace, behind all the little island buildings there is a shooting range on the rocks with a crossbow spawn.
---
Med-x you say? Would be nice if i had something to protect myself from poison
---
I've wondered if Bethesda doesn't add new stuff randomly. Like awhile back I ran into Insutltron the robot who proceeded to mock my mother and then leave. Or just the other day I found the pied piperbot and his rats which was very exciting.
---
It has to be a normal stimpack - can’t be diluted or super - that’s the only thing I think it could be that it won’t let you revive
---
I assume you’re talking about mirelurk queens and scorch beasts?
---
I'll link to another post that has a photo. I'm not putting my badges towards it
---
What’s the deal with the battle royal rumor? Which stupid ass YouTuber made the clickbait video this time? I bet it has “real” datamined information just like the loot boxes
---
If I’m understanding what you mean... I don’t think they’ll do it. It can be exploited to easily to reduce your stash’s weight. That means that people will be holding more items, so the server stability will drop per player.
---
Some guy here sayid all his friends learned it from one plan
---
People told me to just message the player to ask, which I've done a few times, but I'd also like to not waste the time they could be using to play.
---
Then...don't write it. Downvote and move on. Allow the people who want to help, help.
---
I got an explosive cryolator and an explosive flamer before they were removed from the pool. It was definitely a thing.
---
If people are buying them...I sold 5 Nukashine Quantum recipes for 1500 each yesterday. It's basically free caps.
---
Oh nooo. That’s why I wimp out and don’t go back for my dropped supplies
---
I only had normal stimpaks
---
You will have so much fun when you get them. Just remember to invest a point or two into Fireproof if you haven't already. I suggest checking out Toxic Valley events and super mutants. I found at least two of the nuka plans off of them.
---
This would be fairly amazing.
---
It depends on how much damage you take with the killing blow and also if you take any extra damage while you are waiting for the revive.
---
It would be cool if the fences just tilted up and down to the terrain, like a parallelogram. They would be the same length, but different heights on each end. That might solve the damn floating fences.
---
Thanks! Please give a link here
---
think the one that dies has to press "cry for help" ?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmsqv2/tadpole_backpack_vs_possum_backpack_answered/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
So my way of getting around that is by moving your camp beacon. That determines the tames roaming path and if there's no camp items  in the way it just patrols
---
It isn't just the post, the missing stimpacks is another player also having the same issue.
---
It's just inconvenient all around.
---
Well it definitely could be, I honestly hadn't put that much into the psyche of the kids. I only see ungrateful spoiled kids haha. But yeah, theres always a reason for everything kids do, and it always stems from the parents.
---
Was the 91 tameable for you? I still have quite a bit to level to try on one that high
---
Woah good tips. Thanks!
---
Exactly. I actually made a post about this the other day, but thought inspecting only worked randomly. Quickly informed those instances were when the player was there lol
---
It’s not like they want to see it burn, but because they never intended to work hard to earn anything, when they see a loophole where they can steal some quick fortune through, they will do it even it means the destruction of the system others built. Bethesda’s incompetence in protecting their own assets is just unfathomable.
---
I did have fun!    Thanks!    This was actually our second time fighting the queen.  We joined the fight once before when someone else launched the nuke.   That’s how we learned we needed to bring more ammo.  Still not enough this time or am just not doing enough damage I guess.   
---
So insane with all the players and creatures running around.     I swear there were two mirelurk queens out there.
---
No there are 2 bugs here, the UI bug and the screwed up tax is another bug. Not sure why you feel the need to deny what these players are experiencing, it isn't the known ui bug but a different one.
---
Ah, you're right! My bad.
---
Yeah it’s much better than it was when you’d get a message giving you a hard NO on doing a fast travel because enemies were nearby.
---
Are you on PS4?
---
They don't. They took an opinion article and messed up the numbers they listed by 1000%. The guy thinks 406,795 means 406 players.
---
I've spent up to 50 for 1* and 100 for 2* crap just to scrap for scrip. I will scrap what I have, and if the machine has say 15 scrip left, I will shop until I find a cheap 1* and 2* so i can get the daily max.
---
I need to repair and resupply and get weapons that can damage her more first!
---
Roll up on a lv.300+ survivor of the Wasteland trying to rob him.  This is Skyrim level of stupid highway men
---
But why does it also electrocute you?
---
Yup good plan.  For the scout challenges if you get a scorp first the barb will help to make a bleeding syringe barrel and you can kill one outright with a shotgun or weaken to the point a shotgun can kill it or bash with the syringer.  My plan was the scorp but ended up bashing &amp; shotgunning &amp; auto-rifling their hairy asses  for 3 challenges yay.
---
No just regular stims.  Ill try later to see if logging out helped
---
Awesome! I will start working one it when I get the chance. I'll leave the watermark on your maps.
---
Im all for it..maybe it will be a variation of survival
---
Clearly makes the sound, but no crit build
---
Ill see if this works when i log in again later
---
Because enemies are nearby. Before this update you outright couldn't fast travel so not sure how its annoying..
---
Good explanation! But I can't imagine real ones literally electrocute users so much that the yell out in pain?
---
Are these as good as nuka quantum grenades? I also have a decent supply of baseball grenades, are nukas the best? I'm lvl 43
---
Lol true I’ll probably do one tomorrow if you’re interested. What I normally do is have a certain amount of ammo I use for queen and once I go under that I switch guns. I’ll use 3k 5mm and 3k 5.56 before I switch. I try not to run out of ammo so I’m not screwed when the event ends
---
It doesn’t electrocute you, the sound is your guy grunting because of the jets hitting him
---
Yep, I didn't know it's reason till you told me, so hell yea ain't annoying! Good feature to be implemented in game 10/10
---
Still doing the "borrow" backpack mod?
---
My camp is in the Mire and surrounded by higher level legendary enemies. If a low level player shows up to check out my vending and gets mobbed and runs away and the enemies destroy my camp, I really consider that my responsibility. 
---
Cuz I deliberately prioritized building a cool looking camp around an underground bunker vs prioritizing turrets and defenses.
---
Way to go all Grammar Nazi on the person offering to help...
---
In the same vein: "You're intentions," not 'You intention."
---
If a person is: taking active damage like from fire, too deep in water, over radiated, or took too much damage beyond "0" they insta kill. Also sometimes in bbn power armor.
---
Reliable way to do it: find a shallow part of a pond or puddle and stand on a grenade. Then they should be knocked down, not killed.
---
I love the “pay it forward” mentality in the community. Looking forward to being able to do the same once I’m a higher level
---
I was trying to help someone with what is clearly a foreign language. I was genuinely trying to be helpful..... dick
---
Unfortunately a negative sound would probably be on the same lag as the positive one. I hate this as well. I just linger for about 5 seconds after searching.

Probably NoobJuice

As someone who lives in the "greatest" country in the world, if I had the financial means I would straight up leave the country immediately for somewhere that doesn't treat their citizens as basically peasant fodder to feed the greed of the roughly 30 richest families in the country.
---
The biggest fear of every single person I know is having any kind of accident that requires medical attention. People in this country take a Uber to the hospital because a single ambulance ride will bankrupt most people. We live in a country where I know someone who was in a (non minor) car accident and has insurance (through their employer) and still has to weigh the costs of whether or not they should go to the hospital after to get checked out.

Please can you lend it to me?

I put my camps in the air and the garden on the ground with concrete defense walls. They seem to go for the concrete walls first although it's a bit unclear whether that's due to the concrete or access to the plants.

Its like Bethesda made the Tesla rifle just for this
---
Once per Day.
---
Early game was great indeed during November because everybody was in the same situation: low materials, low ammo, low aid item, no knowledge of the farming spots etc. 
---
Now I feel like it wouldn't be as fun to start, because you encounter people who have been there for six months and they just spoil you with plans and gear right out the vault.
---
I found for the repair step on the Archery challenge, cause when I crafted one it came out at 200% condition, was to check them world spawns.
---
There is an archery range on the South West side of Winding Path where one will spawn. Had basically 1/4 durability. Repaired it, used it a bit (bash causes more damage to durability I think), repaired it again.
---
Then I found a player was selling one, bought it, repaired, then put both in my machine for 10 caps ea.
---
This comment is dead on. People come to this sub to complain because the game is to hard for them and it gets really old. It's not that hard to take a bit of time to build proper defense around your camp. I really hope they don't take this crap seriously.
---
Even better!
---
Who knows, maybe it will be the game mode given the most attention depending on player activity.
---
Craft a mom grenade that explodes into dead women corpses
---
This.  Battle Royale is just more icing on the cake and not the cake itself.
---
I was in a camp and a rat spawned inside somehow and avoided the multiple missile turrets, and was working on destroying a bench. I killed it out of courtesy.
---
All levels if you learn the plan
---
At the very least it merits some testing. Not like med-x is super rare anyway
---
Oh no// I have had mine since day one of my game play. Went to the event with a friend as I was level 10 and did the take all on the inventory and have been stuck with them since.
---
All levels
---
Try listening to the alpha tape again.  That’s may be enough to mark that step as done.
---
I agree. Love watching the chain lightening effect!
---
For now, who knows what kinds of updates will be pushed towards the base game if the Battle Royale mode becomes more than just the icing. As we saw with Fortnite, sometimes the Icing can be a little cannibalistic.
---
On xbox I went to challeges in the menu and hit a button to track them. I just hit the map button and they are all on the top right. When I finish something in game a little notification pops up like when you complete atom challenges. 
---
Granted if I'm not sure where I need to go for something I still have to look it up in the challenges submenu.
---
Thank you very much.
---
It's time to see if Bethesda finally made a good duped items tracker or if they didnt learn anything from the first time.
---
Any combination of assassin, unyielding, bolstering, Vanguard plus sentinel plus (combat or marine) = 15-20k.   Add AP refresh then max caps.
---
Rank 5 in Makeshift Warrior?
---
Wait are you serious? I sold level 35 TSE for like 500 caps just yesterday LOL i wish i had knownnnnnnnnnn
---
Ok so if i trade this plan to anyone he learn it imidietly and don't need to use it. So i can give it to infinite people.
---
Playing over six hours a day, everyday? Dude, no hobby is healthy at this rate. Unless OP is home-ridden they definitely have an issue.

Yea I know but you’d think you’d get a variety. Not 100’s of the same legendary effect in a row, because that did happen to me. The fucking Zealot for armor. Every armor piece had zealot.
---
Yeah, weird story, turns out if you abuse kids when they're tiny, by the time they're 30, they'll end up spending all of Mother's Day playing on that goshdarn computer.
---
Level 50 colonel gutsys are the most dangerous non boss enemy in the game.
---
Fortnite got it right as an accident.   Our creation engine was never created for that kind of experience and won’t be an Internet smash.
---
I've been scouring everywhere looking for a life saving sentinel chest piece. They do have value to those of us who do not pvp.
---
I don't think I've ever even clicked the social button. So no not everybody knows.
---
Shows damage for each shot I believe l
---
I dont know if it has.  It could be dupers just offloading remaining stock in an easy manner now that you can put them in a vending machine?
---
So makes me wonder, if this becomes more than a rumor, makes me wonder what Bethesda is thinking trying to force 76 to become something it's not.
---
What system u on?
---
I'm sorry someone else's enjoyment of the game offends you.
---
yup, but it needs a lot of ammo :D
---
There are all sorts of varying spots to find good resources. Anything in particular that you're looking to find? I can direct you to almost any material in the Appalachian Wastelands
---
How is he full of shit when he is right though? This game is by far one of the buggiest games to come out in a long time. From a AAA Dev. too?!?!
---
Xbox?
---
The three current repeatables (That I know if); Biv and the two Pioneer quests are once a day, they reset at 8pm EDT. If you forgot one a previous night, you could even do it at 7pm EDT and then the next one an hour later, (Only fully tested on Biv). Also if you install the new personal terminal from the Atomic Shop, you can check to see if any of the repeatables are available or not.
---
No, there's a time after you die that you either can, or can't cry for help. During that time someone can revive you regardless of if you've cried or not. Crying only alerts people around you to help if they can. 
---
If you get too damaged you just die, with no cry for help option.
---
Is this only happening on consoles because I've never had this on PC.
---
Yes. That won't happen, the game has too many ex0loiters
---
Wow you are such a douch lmao. Im just pointing out a bug. I adjusted my camp and fixed the problem for myself already. Its still a bug that needs to be fixed, hence why I made a post.
---
That sounds like a really cool idea
---
I hate enemies spawning inside locked doors
---
Ok cool I’ll be on later tonight and see what I got in stock  gamer tag is coldblooded7849
---
Mixed feelings. I like having a fancy camp and building around in-game content, so I tend to prioritize appearance over defense. Currently I have a camp in the Mire which I built around an underground bunker type location. 
---
But there are defense strategies beyond turrets. For example, all my vending machines are inside my camp and pretty far off the ground. My generator is 2 stories off the ground. The few turrets I have are at ground level.
---
For whatever reason, the enemies seem to be into entering the ground level bunker and destroying things there, and sometimes destroying things at ground level. But they don't seem to be into climbing a bunch of stairs to attack the vending and generator, and it's definitely not because they're reliably getting killed by my turrets or other players.
---
In the underground bunker most of what I crafted is just decorations that use steel and wood, so it's not a big repair cost. 
---
To be fair, I also invested in the home defense perk, so my turrets aren't level 1 either. If you haven't upgraded your defense perks, that will help. 
---
But I like the strategic element of considering how to design camps that are more protected. For example, building camps inside in-game content that can't be destroyed, or against a rock wall, or putting your foundation underwater and building on a lake or etc.
---
If camps were easier to protect I would've had less motivation to come up with cool locations...
---
And a frag grenade, not s more powerful one.
---
News to me thanks!
---
Good Lord 2c?  They go for 10-15x that.  Sell me those next time!
---
I saw someone mention they go back to their spawn point. Had one poof on me so I went back to where he spawned and sure enough, there he was.
---
Because some guy in upper management isn’t a gamer and doesn’t understand the market at a deeper level.
---
Thank you kind dweller! We even happened to already be on the same world! supper easy haha
---
Exactly. That being said, if there was a way to bring my weight down, I’d totally do it...
---
You can also just store the item and replace.  No dead brahmin or materials spent.
---
For the record, I don’t mind clearing enemies that show up at someone’s camp while I visit.  I apparently“brought” a Scorchbeast to someone’s camp once; I lured it way to fight it, and repaired everything it damaged in that camp (as any good Responder should).
---
I tend to use generic “they” but I assume *everyone* has a mouse in their pocket.
---
Yup
---
It is vastly superior in every way other than very slow initial load in.  It is a great game.
---
i moved a crafting bench cause a friend got stuck in a wall when they FT'd to my camp the other day. When i tried to put it back it "intersected with another object". Got rid of all the other benches and decorations to try and replace it. No luck.
---
Ended up just deciding to rebuild my base after nothing worked for a day and a half of trying friends' suggestions. It was due for renovations cause of the vendor update so I'm not really upset about that. I'm just upset that i was all but forced to do it before i was *really* ready.
---
I tried to post a psa about this right after the vendor patch update. That's when it started. 
---
They did the hot fix for dupping but they didn't catch this.
---
Have you tried getting into a suit of power armour? 
---
I’ve had success with this method at any point that I’ve gotten stuck in terrain or a building
---
u/CMDR_Invertedcross
---
Kadem-Ho is my PSN, thank you.!
---
&gt; This is why I have to get a new Brahman every time I come to my camp
---
Same. RIP Brahmin VI. Welcome Brahmin VII!
---
They're under aid, and don't pay more than 500 caps. I've seen as low as 200, and as high as 1000. Don't waste your money.
---
Hey I’m interested in this, my psn is invertedcross if you got a second
---
I got you already :D
---
Probably
---
Can anyone on Xbox One provide a similar deal? I'll even toss ya some caps to make it worthwhile!
---
At least you know to admit it when you are wrong.
---
Have an upvote, friend.
---
I think Adventure will remain the main mode for this games entire lifespan. I think BR and Team Deathmatch will be nice side things we will have.
---
Go to white springs they’re always on sale I think from the free states vendor
---
Can this personal terminal also check Daily Quest availability? Can they also be started through the terminal or is it just to check availability?
---
Yes, quite often, or even underneath floors. I moved my camp module to help keep it from happening to others at my camp, but I’m not sure that works either. 
---
When I fast travel home, I spawn well outside my camp now, but someone messaged me during an SBQ fight the other night that they were stuck in my floor. Could’ve just been trolling me though since they saw where I was but I’ll never know 🤷‍♀️
---
Point me in that direction friend lol I’ll buy all day long hahahahaha
---
I bulk all my junk to sell it. You only need to keep some scrap for fixing and building. 50-100 of each thing. Unless you don’t actually use it. If you don’t use it, dump it. It’s hard to break to hoarder ways!
---
Your apology is no good here
---
Hey just to let you know - I've had the program generate flux maps now - they-re on the main post
---
Badges only have a 25% chance of drop if you complete the event successfully (keep kindling on the fire until the last objective is complete).
---
Omg duh... you da man
---
WV lumber yard, Morgantown High School, AVR Medical, and Black Water Mine. I usually hit those spots for resources. Pretty good variety when I puke up everything and scrap.
---
Got it too, I'd go through a nuke, see a 3* legendary, kill it, look at its body and see a legendary weapon, poof gone.
---
That challenge switches to a different weapon after you complete it for crossbows - great idea, but not everyone will have it for crossbows at the moment.
---
I second this. I'm wasting about 12 perk points because of it, like.... why tf do they make chems weigh so goddamn much? 😪
---
Idk - his presence spawned the Ghouls and he sat and watched them ruin the guys expensive stuff? If nothing else it's a dick move.
---
That will have been the cause then. The constant attacks were pulling my attention from the screen prompts, must have missed that.
---
I'll take it!
---
Oh awesome thank you!
---
now try and place some concrete barriers to block their usual bullet path and watch them suddenly spawn at a complete different position.....to attack the same items again
---
After the update I noticed enemies suddenly changing spawn locations around my camp as soon as I block one route to my crops
---
If I fast travel home ,there is no problem . Is this worth submitting a ticket to Bethesda ? I never done that before ...
---
Thankfully, It builds in large batches, and I can get 280 per with Super Duper procs.
---
It would have the same lag, yes. However at least we'd *know* that we were waiting on the server. Currently we have this awkward period deciding if it's a failure or lag.
---
I mean 25% is a lot if you ask me. I also haven't failed a single event. Well, keep trying I guess, especially since it ain't too long.
---
Do it in third person, there's VFX of it and all
---
No . Did not try that .... I'm not wearing my PA alot .... Only when overencumbered or nuke zone
---
How does thing work? If I learned the mod then you wouldn’t be able to get it back right?
---
Make use of carry weight perks and sell any crap you don't need on here. I lit pick everything I find up and when my stash is full, I just do a job lot of junk and sell it on here. Make a decent amount of caps from it too.
---
Or make it a menu option. I’ve been away from ESO for a while, but you could toggle a few loot options.
---
Yep uploaded a video of the “sleeping death” goals to YouTube yesterday
---
Right?! "Encrypted" popped up while I was struggling with a recalcitrant roof panel. I was waaay overuncumbered and out of 5.56 ammo, and even though I had the mats to craft more, I had to pass. First time I haven't done Encrypted when it popped up. I just wasn't ready. I need to finish this stupid build!
---
Multiple times every day, many opinions, read through and decide for yourself.
---
Welp. Haha
---
They is actually better than he, I'll start using that.
---
It shows total damage with both shots.
---
I payed 125 caps for all my mutations and didn’t think much of it, now that I’m thinking about it the guy might have been a super and I didn’t realize🤔
---
Yeah, everything's still tax free at Harper's Ferry, and who am I to try competing with Wallace's soothing voice, anyway? ;-)
---
Thanks, I appreciate your response. Any experience being a sneaky gunslinger?
---
Did they ever fix the optimization for Dishonored 2? I tried it when it came out and it was a mess.
---
Even crits miss lol
---
You can start the event if it’s available (a day has passed since the last one). For now it only tracks those three events.
---
Excellent! Thanks!
---
What does it mean to you?
---
Most people are selling the TSE weapons for more than 10K caps.  Old Man Winter is both a rare headwear and a reward from a limited event that's over.  I've sold some of my common masks for 250 caps, so I'd imagine OMW can fetch at least 1000 caps, but probably not more than a few K.  BoS plans can be found close to original value at some vendors(~500 caps), but i've also seen people charge a K or so.
---
I'd say, generously, that plan bundle is worth around 6K and that's being generous.  You could easily get 10K or more for a TSE handmade.  In fact, if you're selling, I'd give you up to 15K because that's basically all I have.
---
I just sent you a message, your world is full of you want to join mine. I’m CobrahCommandur
---
Patch notes
---
It is bugged and you learn it upon picking, you dont use that plan.
---
Nice! I’ll give that a shot!
---
My favorite so far was getting stuck inside someone’s locked house.
---
Alright
---
no, but you might lose the duped weapon
---
I won’t be on for awile bc I’m doing Mother’s Day stuff so you should probably give it to somebody else but if you’ve got a normal tickblood tequila recipe I’ve been looking for one
---
I need to finish the badge. Gt MadDogMolina
---
"The" vendor?  Like an NPC vendor?  NEEEEEED
---
Imo I think it’s just bc they look cool and have nice animations and the base game lasers suck so they all flock to BE AAE and TSE lasers so they can get some fun out of it
---
Ok, can I finally get a definitive answer on this? Nobody else is responding anywhere.
---
Why does everybody keep calling them legacy weapons? They're coming back. The patch 5 notes clearly say
---
&gt; Weapons: Flamers, Cryolators, plasma weapons, and laser weapons can no longer spawn with the Explosive legendary mod.
---
&gt; Dev Note: The explosive mod causes weapons to fire bullets that are . . . explosive. The weapons listed above don’t fire bullets, so we’ve temporarily removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied so we can make adjustments.
---
"we've *TEMPORARILY* removed the ability for them to spawn with that mod applied". They'll be back. Why is everybody treating them like a misprint MTG card or something?
---
I have yet to meet a friendly player on Ps4 at level 33. The only players I come across shoot on sight so I haven’t been spoiled haha.
---
Wich platform are you on?
---
Messaged back
---
Yeah .... Me in someone's fusion generator room whiteout any doors to get out ...😂😂
---
If its been asked so much (which it has every hour) just use the search function
---
This is my build

---
I use a bloodied death claw with full unyielding set of armor. My damage is around 1800 for the claw and my damage resist are around 500 for physical and energy. I have lead lining in all my armor so normal rads are not a big deal, but I need to use power armor not nuke zones.
---
PSN Alluminati1ftw
---
I can toss you some caps too, to make it worth it.
---
It's not resisted in any form outside a legendary effect.  In short, take off everything that increases you DR and fight any of the heavy hitters you find easy.  You'll die just as quick.
---
The condescending didn't help, no, but the point was to ask for an in-game solution, not an out of game one.
---
For me, it happens most when the creature goes flying or gets knocked away at death.  I will go up to the body, but it will vanish. However it generally respawns as a meat pile or goo in the spot it was when it died, before going flying
---
I can almost always find the legendary pile if one vanishes.
---
Im sorry i thought this was fo76 where you can talk about anything related to fallout 76 if you're so tired of seeing it get off.
---
Gotcha!
---
I can hook you up.
---
Med-X did have a poison resist effect in FO4, which made them really helpful when fighting Mirelurk Queens; however, that is absent from it in FO76.
---
I thought this would be obvious too, but everytime I tell my friends just to join me through the social menu, I almost always get a "what's the social menu? Just send me an invite."
---
I have 2 Ultracite lasers &amp; neither of them shoot green lasers? At least from my perspective I don't see it. Could it be from the installed mods? Was kinda pumped on shooting green beams. . .
---
I used to be at twin lakes and left because of this reason. It is crazy popular I’d say second to whitesprings. Tons of nice lakes out there.
---
I have an unyielding bos cav right arm, which bloodied rifles do you have?
---
I think it's based on where you put the camp device. Sort of a welcome mat. It's weird though when I jump to my own camp I spawn a ways away. But had a friend jump and watch people come in and they always spawn right next to camp.
---
Then you, my good sir, are the only person playing 76 who doesn't have this problem right now. It is a real and tested glitch that everyone is experiencing. If you are not experiencing this bug, then surely Todd Howard himself has blessed you with a functional game.
---
I’m fine with having to replace camp items and setting up defenses but having to reprice all items in the vending machines if they are destroyed is needless tedium.
---
Do not VATS attack the ceiling turrets with melee. :) you’ll glitch through
---
Gotcha. I’m online now. Feel free to just join my game.
---
Looks like collecting issues of magazines is bugged too
---
Supremekittlord
---
Couldn't really tell you, I've never played it myself. Just knew about it being something else Russell voiced in.
---
Yeah, it's a whole lot better with this thing. I managed to ditch my pack rat card and exchange it for 2 levels of heavy gunner and I'm now taking my Resolute Veteran with me.
---
If it draws away the Whitesprings Spawn Campers I'm 100% for it. 
---
I feel like it could also be something like the gladiator style things they've had in Oblivion and FNV.
---
It shows total damage, *but* it's somewhat bugged for explosives. Auto grenade launcher, missile launcher, and fat man will show something a bit different. Keep in mind that you're only dealing half of that damage (a bit less actually, due to armor penetration) if only one of the two projectiles hit
---
If I had caps. 😞
---
Someone was camped at that junk pile south of white spring. I heard assaultrons fighting and saw a big red flash and then heard a death sound for a robot. I was buying some stuff and I got out of my power armor to repair a weapon when a sheepsquatch kicked open the door and came towards me. I got into a bathroom in their camp and messaged the guy that there was a sheepsquatch literally in their house. They quickly rushed back and this guy’s house was almost demolished at this point, we took out the sheepsquatch and had a beer afterwards. Dude gave me a discount on a Tesla rifle he was selling.
---
So it doesn't award the tadpole badges?
---
1
---
Snap, but worth keeping in mind if it happens again. The only issue you may have is placing the power armour.
---
I discovered this “glitch” by chance when I found a player’s camp. They’d placed their cooking area too close to a wall.
---
Easy to sit down &amp; cook, impossible to get up.
---
Good luck, &amp; happy trails!
---
I have a bloodied hardened lever action rifle. +50 damage resistance while aiming and bullets explode
---
Mind joining on me in about 10 min? GT: McChicken888888
---
Thank you for your help
---
Ya I guess if your playing on pc I’d be happy to help you out
---
Struggle is real out here 😩
---
Ok, thanks for clearing that up for me
---
Wood and steel
---
I don't mind strong enemies but this is just bad balancing. It doesn't make sense a few low lvl bugs are more dangerous than deathclaws
---
Yeah, the zoom feature seems kinda useless. 
---
And if it's not clicking, are you moving? Cause if you move at all it wont let you take a picture. Including being hit by attacks.
---
Id be interested in doing this trade if its max level im assuming it is
---
I met this guy the other day, but I didn't realise you could drop things to make him not attack! He came after me and I had to put him down. )':
---
I'm so poor I don't even understand.
---
This. Sooo much this. Its not rewarding in any way. Specially now that player vending is up sometimes I will sit with my ps4 running so I can sell things while I work from home during the day. Forces me to run to my bases rescue all the time for no reason. Its almost to the point where instead of killing the enemies I just instant server hop to not deal with it or at least take the dice roll of it not being 5 muties with mini guns. 
---
Tbh its really frustrating that tje solution to so many problems in this game is server hopping. Hell finding the new camara was basically just a quest to server hop for 45 min straight. I wanted to find it organically but now I am missing out on things because I still havent found it on accident 2 weeks later. So here I sit, server hopping, hurting the stability of the game, so that maybe I can enjoy playing the game tonight.
---
If player activity determines it, the game will never even get a BR mode. The vast majority of players don't give a single iota of a fuck about pvp. Survival mode is filled with the same handful of people killing each other over and over again with full sets of sentinel assassin's armor and bloodied explosive handmades or lasers. Hell, many people aren't even willing to hop onto survival to do the weekly special weapon challenges unless they are easy to prep in adventure (i.e craft 50 of X, gather materials in adventure and log out next to a workbench, then craft it in survival and hop back on to adventure)
---
I server hopped right at that place and got it third try. I feel like it has the best spawn rate
---
Well that's a shame. Doesn't seem like there's an awful lot in the way of poison resistance throughout the game, then
---
I can sell serums to robot vendors for ~500 caps... 
---
You can even make a profit by buying from people at ~200c and straight up selling them to robot vendors...
---
Lots of Daily issues in general. For Ecological Balance, its random for me if it lets me use the password or tells me I have to go find it again. Also good old Cop a Squatter quest being about a 50% chance for me of completing when I kill all the marked enemies or not. And of course, I haven't been able to get any dailies in The Mire since patch 7. Good times.
---
Ps4 also.
---
Have a nice day ...
---
I just jotted them down in a note book lol.
---
Mine is up for 3141, here's hoping someone likes my humour :P
---
Ah gotcha. I need to reinstall it and try it again. But I just got FO76 yesterday, I have a feeling I’ll be doing this for awhile.
---
What she said^^ 
---
Want, patches, now! 🥳
---
Thank you I appreciate that. Perhaps instead you could tell me if, like in Fallout 4, there are grades to the Power armours (there was a,b,c,d and I think e) and if so how does one acquire them? I'd also appreciate a straight answer on which nonPA armours are best. I know there is a Scout  which is supposed to be #1 but is robot better than combat? (etc)
---
I don’t have hardly any caps either.  
---
He just spawned in front of me so I thought why not let other people know so if they want to browse what he has for sale go for it
---
For the Vertibot, you just have to be REALLY close. I shot at a cargobot convoy and one of them flew down low enough to be recognized by the camera. Or you could do the easy way and get the ammo factory.
---
Thank you, I appreciate the input
---
I got mine there, just server hop a little bit
---
If anyone need to revive someone in water as I do I'm ready to take a plunge for someone if they'll do the same, PS4: misterbomber99
---
He must have been miffed! LOL
---
Ohh someone doesn’t like nice people. TY for the downvote 😂🤣😂🤣
---
Wood: use green thumb and pick up bleached dog wood around the toxic valley. They weight one pound a piece but they also give you three wood apiece. 
---
Steel: West Tek has a lot of super mutants and they all drop weapons that you can use scrapper on and get nearly 20 steel per assault rifle
---
Juicehead apparently, I only skimmed through the video but it seems like he's in his usual schedule
---
I just spent two weeks raising caps and tracking down a seller to buy a tse gauss and it made me feel so accomplished, I feel bad for all these duper’s who will never know that feeling because they took the easy and cheating route.
---
You can make a profit on a lot of stuff people sell, doesn't mean people should have to buy things for vastly inflated prices. 1000 for a serum is just wrong.
---
You're a nice one 🤓 the struggle is real if your poor too. Like when you finally see Gramh but can't afford shit 😭
---
Yes it is what third perk is on the arm
---
Constantly.
---
No prob.
---
Area around Harpers is pretty good for trading - lots of camp stores.
---
Never played F4, but Combat is the best armor with BoS uppgrade. 
---
Best powerarmor id say X-01
---
+1 strength
---
Wait, TKs Mantis? I remember seeing him in some of the old FOnline sessions. I was never active in PvP but I think he was with me on a couple of raids we used to do there. Didn't know he moved on to 76, or that he made videos on it
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTmXHvGZiSY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTmXHvGZiSY) 
---
:D
---
Sounds good. I’ll be home in 20 min
---
This. I started with medic but the diffuser isn't in the game. Switched to herpatologist but it wont count the frog habitat (that ive crafted in various camps and workbenches). 
---
It's really disheartening as I don't have much time to play and I have to a) write down all components of the challenge and then b) waste my time trying to complete challenges that are broken.
---
Suddenly feel like i have been given the secret password to the cool kids club! Thank you. One question, what is the 2x starched jeans perk? I haven't seen that yet (I'm guessing it's a card)
---
I KNEW IT!!!!
---
Alright thanks I’ve got the margarita one but can’t make it bc I only have one tequila and can’t make anymore
---
You should probably stay in the forest region until your level is higher.
---
Jesus you’re not lying. I’m lvl 81. These bastards actually can take me out if I don’t watch my health.
---
How is he biased exactly? Seems pretty level headed to me
---
Alright perfect lmk!
---
They fixed the quick reload on syringer by swapping weapons, so it’s less fun now.
---
You got a mic
---
Its a sequel not a reboot and there was supposed to be a 3rd that was unfortunately shelved.
---
Had to sacrifice my stacked foundation camp to this. I couldn’t delete some wall sections without ditching the foundation. Oh well. It was time.
---
That sucks
---
I mean it could be possible..if you had all your gear it wouldn't really be a fair BR mode
---
SBQ ? ....... and thanlk you!! Yes I know of mutations but only as far as random ones that wear off, get cured whatever. I haven't yet been to the enclave (I'm getting there) so PROBABLY lots more questions after that.
---
You got discord?
---
Yeah but that doesn't invalidate the evidence
---
ah...
---
I always keep my under armor on when i have died to help others, that's probably why it hasn't failed yet :)
---
Under armor probably protects me from being to "damaged" :)
---
I'm just replacing stored assets for the most part so the resource costs are pretty light for this build thankfully.
---
Ok, join on me now
---
I had the quantum grenade plan drop from a mole miner during Uranium Fever.
---
Yep
---
He even said he was excited to see what they do with the game. He clearly hates it and wants Todd Howard to die in a fire /s
---
Fffffffff ... We’ve all been there lol. But building a fresh camp is always fun for me tho and very satisfying
---
Then do I get my caps back?
---
U play on Xbox
---
The Pioneer Scout challenges should also be able to be tracked like a traditional quest so you don't have to keep opening the map and scrolling through all the challenges to see what you need to do next.
---
As far as I know, No, it cannot check for daily quest availability. For me it has two menu options, one shows the Biv and Pioneer Repeatables and if they are done or available. The second menu option, "Alerts" or something, shows me nothing. On patch day, the Alerts menu showed a a selection under it, something about a train station alert, but did nothing when selected. After patch day, nothing has appeared for me under that menu. But that's my experience.
---
Getting those too. 
---
I can’t plant the crops either for the challenge
---
The quick reload was a bug for all weapons, it benefited the dragon far more than the syringer. The problem is it's absolute garbage and doesn't have any useful barrels. The damage reduction one is ok, but even the radscorpion venom barrel is awful. The damage ticks by very slowly, and barely does enough damage in total to take out a level 1 scorched. You will end up emptying (quite literally) hundreds of syringes to kill something like a glowing yao guai, even with the most damaging mod possible. Combine that with damage over time instead of immediate, no good multipliers (the real damage is an effect, the physical impact damage is close to nothing so headshots won't help), and needing to reload after every hit, the syringer is not in any way viable beyond the forest.
---
The game mode is called nuclear winter but he never said that's all that that it will be. We already know that it has other things
---
This is completely false. I have sold over 10K caps in ammo, everything but shotgun shells priced at 1 cap. I have sold multiple chunks of 1000 or more rounds and received caps as I should (900 caps for 1000 rounds).
---
Joining.
---
Okay will do
---
Singular they is pretty grammatically acceptable these days.  
---
I just wish English had a non gendered singular pronoun that isn't rather harsh to use on a person.
---
Saw one guy selling them for 777 caps, almost bought it purely because of the luck joke
---
You will find them in normal world containers if you loose it, think i am seeing 3-4 every day...
---
I dont meen the broken camera, but deluxe prosnap.
---
Actually,  i am going to ut a few in my vendor machine for 0 caps next time i find them :)
---
I am on Xbox, so can't help you...
---
I don't think I agree that making the game unbalanced is the solution here. This might not be a realistic expectation, but maybe Bethesda should patch the dupe exploits instead.
---
The game’s going on steam later this year with doom eternal, rage 2, and the new wolfenstein(s).
---
I'll try to balance the clicking and the activating swing and find a sweet spot.
---
Yep.
---
Its your fault for playing a failed game.
---
What’s a legacy weapon
---
Spend it. Buy plans and stuff. There's 24 player shops and the vendors. If you have nothing to spend it on what does it matter anyway?
---
You can't trade them sadly. You can't put them in containers, or sell them in your store, or drop them to people
---
Except the amount sold isn't what popped up in the top left, it's what you have *total*.
---
Too bad every legendary is going in the grinder now.
---
No. The voice clips are about "being victorious" and "rounds" and a "firestorm" if I'm not mistaken. 
---
The assumption is it's BR because of the whole "You're not in a safe area"....
---
Which does sound right but is hardly conclusive.
---
When the legendary vendor comes out we’re supposed to get quad durability and ultra light power armor legendary effects.
---
Ghoul Slayer gama gun? Hilarious
---
My shotgun has been inconsistent at times.  Lvl 5 and lvl 50 Protectrons require the same amount of shots to kill for one.
---
And check out his account too, this guy’s saltier than the city in Utah.
---
I was unaware you didn’t get any of the caps. I just thought it would hit 25k and the rest would disappear. That really sucks.
---
I was trying to get 23k to try and buy a decent weapon :/
---
Yeah same kinda sad but hopefully y'all learn from my mistake
---
Except I'm not. So stop.
---
Likely calling you an A-hole for selling cheap. People want crazy unreasonable prices for things sometimes. Other times, people are out there being total bros (200-250 cap serums, etc)
---
I bought a X01 calibrated mod for 1000 caps. Seemed more than fair given the rarity. I have a spare T-60 calibrated mod listed for 600 right now. Also seems fair given they are also pretty rare. 
---
500 for a created leg is more than fair, probably even selling yourself short, given the flux requirements. If I didn't have a full set I would track you down and buy them ASAP
---
Just use the advanced conduits. So much more neat and tidy looking.
---
In my opinion the best grenades are Orbital Strike beacons.
---
Let's just say if you show up with 40 of them people know you mean business
---
I'm dying 🤣
---
shit, u right
---
Vendors do t have it too? Just search every cointainer you come to. I have 5 pro snap cameras on me, cant trade tho
---
Couldn't agree more.
---
I normally sell it for what it says unless it's the ones you listed
---
I do not
---
Oh fuck thanks for sharing :D
---
Oh I'm sorry, I just now understand. I'm surprised you lose all the caps, I figured it took you to the limit. I have a TSE Gatling gun I've been trying to sell and some other things if you're on Xbox. I'll give you a nice deal.
---
Really? Maybe the fact it's 5 levels higher in the end actually means it's still the better one to go for?
---
So a Shishkebab with a "normal" build; that is, with no adrenal reaction/bloodied boost, I believe does 101 physical and 70ish energy. Energy damage as you're probably aware is far less effective than physical/radiation damage, so by rule of thumb I usually take it for half its listed value.  
---
That place the Shish at roughly 136 damage at end game. Which is flat out abysmal.
---
What about these specific items then?
---
Like sheepscuach?
---
For acid 3-4 per and adhesive 2 per unit
---
LOL
---
Steel and aluminum I never sell lol
---
Thank you psn sadly but yeah I thought it would just max me out so I guess this doubles as a P.S.A lol
---
I could see it as a last team standing horde mode, which still allows them to use building in an interesting way.
---
It is an ingredient on the chem station... I want to say to make either psycho or fury... i can't remember.
---
Yeah was about to comment this.
---
7 hours of looting every sack, tool box etc. Nothing.
---
I thought I saw that repaired ones can't be traded but broken ones can since they're junk.
---
This, I run between both event and have enough to turn in for the daily with extras.
---
Usually if someone stoves while I'm turning them in... I'll drop the items so they can complete it quickly too.
---
I think I have one but not sure if  it is lifesaving sentinel or cavalier...
---
Reviving a friend is quite easy - just go to any encrypted or scorchbeast Queen event and look for people screaming for help....
---
If you are on PS4 i will lend you carry capacity plan (due to bug i am able to) so you can lear it free, just let here your psn.
---
Just FYI hunter was quite easy to do, but yeah it sucks overall :/
---
Its already in the game it's called the tattered mole helmet/outfit
---
Hopefully /u/bethesdagamestudios_ takes note.
---
if you did that for all the things people ask over and over there would be like 3 posts here a day..
---
sorry it bums you out so much
---
Are they practical to  craft? Where can I find plans?
---
I don’t know why your getting downvoted. That’s extremely unhealthy to play 6 hours a day
---
Is it wearable?
---
Hell Fuck no!....build a better base or use more turrets....i cant tell you how much more loot I've been getting since the vendors came out....and I don't mean from buying/selling shit......sorry
---
Terrible news.. damn. Thank you for sharing this info despite it totally bums me out.
---
Yes. They made it that sheepsquatch loot isn’t scrapped by scrap all, so why don’t they do it for this
---
It's based on where you put the C.A.M.P. device when you first placed it down for visitors. It's a certain distance away from it for you.
---
Any idea on where to find one?
---
The pied piper has been in the game since the beginning. I believe the insult bot was added around the time of Fasnacht
---
Lmao
---
Dolly sods in the mire
---
Who's your favorite possum?
---
He's never had them for me. Only Whitespring style furniture.
---
Any responder bot can have them.
---
I’m on Xbox and would love a tse Gatling :)
---
Oh and magazines at 0.5lbs or 0.25lbs so as much as I’d love to collect them and put them in one of the display cases that are eventually coming it won’t happen cause I just don’t have the stash space to burn lol
---
One of my camps spawns super mutants, scorched, ghouls, liberators, wolves and the occasional alpha deathclaw....need those turrets.
---
Np heavy combat armor sells in watoga and all the bos and deep pocketed stuff is in grafton at the train stations
---
He might not have all the recipes at the same time. I didn't notice the Sweet Roll recipe when I found the Brain Bombs recipe, but next time I went there he had it.
---
I like little tidbits of history like this.  Thanks for sharing 😁
---
Sometimes it's even worse. I put something in my vendor machine and it disappeared.
---
Can confirm. Any responder not can sell them.
---
Do enemies prioritize the dummy targets over other stuff? Or are they just a useful distraction in general? 
---
Enemies keep destroying my generator like 2 minutes after I leave my camp so I never get any shoppers cuz I’m not on the map :|
---
I have no interest in playing DM/BR type modes.. 
---
that said.. I would not be offended or bothered by a DM/BR mode in the game at all..
---
at the end of the day its probably a pretty cool thing for the people playing 76 that are stoked on PVP..
---
Not really, since you need Yellow cake, but you get them from Enclave
---
If you get hit by a SBQ in just under armor you don't die? What kind of under armor are you wearing. 
---
It's all dependent on a lot of factors, mutations, diseases, just plain endurance. I can kill myself with 4 frag grenades, other people need like 2, and some need like 12.
---
Wouldnt you want bolstering if your also usuing unyielding?
---
You may have noticed I have already updated my post accordingly, thanks for sharing your experience. My points are still valid for singular items at less than 10 caps, so it's certainly not *completely* false. 
---
It seems I mistakenly took another thread at face value, stating that you wouldn't receive **anything** when you sold 1000 pieces at 1 cap each.
---
Ya both get boost when low HP
---
And that vault 51 pits other people against each other to determine the overseer
---
I’ve been finding them in red tool boxes
---
Hard to value presently.  Last weeks duplication upset market prices.   It would have been trade-only before.   Perhaps you can find one in the high teens now (PS4).
---
I really wish the Mayor would say “It’s MOTHER’S DAY!”
---
I’m not sure. I haven’t had a chance to fight sheepscuach yet. I was thinking something like Caanerin world boss from ESO Summerset.
---
Whitesprings the ghouls have them and I just got 1 of a bug at the campfire event.
---
I’m  just wearing the combo to try it out . Armor for it right is 400/413/35
---
Someone wants 10k but i was wondering if worth more maybe after patch to resale
---
They even added a little skateboard ramp for you to jump on it!
---
When I travel to my own camp, I spawn in a pretty predictable spot. So I put signs there directing people to my shop.
---
But whenever I see people fast travel to my camp, they spawn somewhere else entirely, usually in the middle of the pond at my camp and halfway stuck in a wall.
---
What gives?
---
Slurp
---
I know getting out of PA doesn't work; you get the message stating you can't exit PA here. I usually fast travel to the nearest location then end up running back.
---
Came back to my camp with another player stuck the other day and I had her accept a friend request, then ran a short distance away, and had her fast travel to my location.
---
Why lie when it's happening to *everybody*?
---
Ah that's kind of sad. In my experience everybody was friendly to new players. Maybe you are in survival mode without realizing? :D
---
lol, i didn't mention the SBQ :)
---
The way i do it is by jumping down in the rad pool next to the entrance of black water mines, and annoy the "miners" a bit until they kill me, the the player that needs help jump in and revive me :)
---
Makes sense since I have not got the “you cannot travel” message
---
My legs are vanguard , arms unyielding  and chest is dense/ AP refresh
---
What console you on?
---
Alright, I won't be on til later. Probably like 7pm eastern time. Give me your tag and it's yours. I'd like to get 4k for it.
---
Convenience fee that I don't mind paying. I rarely use MG so it's not a huge issue for me, but I don't think 1c is unreasonable. Anything more than that though (for any single bullet) is likely never going to sell though.
---
I need to revive someone in water on XB1. Gt MadDogMolina
---
I didn't bother with it because once you're no longer hidden after the first shot or kill, you no longer get the extra damage boost. The revolvers have a slow fire rate.
---
Yes it is much better. I just never realized the reason
---
Just watched the clip again after you said that, smh
---
Hell,  I picked up a 3 star in game,  but it wasn't one I wanted so I sold it in my vending machine. I've started putting legendaries in there. I got an X-01 jet pack out of someone's vending machine.
---
Ok I must be thick lol... I downloaded Imgur, I clicked on the link above &amp; said open in app. I see all kinds of maps with dots... But nothing of any use, since I can't make them bigger... So I reread the post &amp; sure can't spot anything that leads me to anything useful... Help!! BTW this project seems pretty amazing to me.
---
strange :/
---
and really annoying i can guess :(
---
They put it in the patch notes, but the Morgantown Airport Terminal is extremely different. I couldn’t even figure out how to get to the Responder HQ room
---
Since most of us use our camp as a free fast travel point, I don’t see that happening
---
Awesome man that sounds great, my gamertag is Sidthesloth814 send me a message when you’re on my Xbox has been weird about adding friends lol
---
Yep, I got basically ignored last time I tried to post all the things I found wrong/game suggestions
---
I got mine from the Harper’s Ferry vendor.
---
Mr. Analytica
---
It is "online-play how you want" game
---
I played Dishonored 2 without any problems. Twice. Great game.
---
Well its designed to be a multiplayer game, either go back to fallout 4 or wait for fallout 5
---
Last time, Bethesda did a pass to remove any duplicate legendaries from players' inventories and leave them with just the one, and also banned players who had an unrealistic amount of the same item pass through their inventory. So they can probably catch the people who conspicuously had hundreds of explosive energy weapons, even if they traded all those around by now. 
---
Worst case scenario, Bethesda just does a pass to completely remove explosive energy weapons from *everyone's* inventory, duped or no.
---
If you PC we can meet so you might take a closer look
---
It is a shame but I think it’s fair. Anything would be appreciated by a new player, not just legendaries. Even just some water is useful as hell at the start
---
There's a mod for PC that does this. It's a bit OP to being able to swap metas while in combat. I'd like to see it but with the same limitations as Fast Travel.
---
this video as well explains it well [https://youtu.be/GEuJyE02Dlw](https://youtu.be/GEuJyE02Dlw)
---
This turned out to be a non issue, just a visual bug doing no real harm. Find a better hobby...
---
You can solo this game. I actually prefer to play that way myself. There's only two events that you need people, but when those events happen randoms show up and help out.
---
I'm on PC and my store has 1* bloodied power fist for about 1k caps
---
Yeah, especially as I kinda need one to get a back pack....
---
GRRRRRRAFTON'S Mayor here, wishing all matriarchs of Appalachia a Happy Mother's Day.
---
I'm also available to let someone revive me. I'm done with the challenge but willing to help for no fee.
---
* **PSN - xSlack_Jaws_420x**
---
He spawned on me 2 days ago! Poor bastard never stood a chance. 💀
---
Well that's what BR games are, right? Trying to be the last one standing but the reason you're all pushed together is some circle of death that closes at a certain time. 
---
Also, did we listen to the same voice clips or are you sourcing something else? At no point did I hear anything about being "victorious" in the stuff I linked.
---
*Crickets chirping.*
---
I keep seeing posts like "come back they fixed the bugs!" but as long as posts like this keep cropping up
---
I'm good
---
Thanks bud. Sent you a PM
---
Have you guys also noticed an issue where you won’t be able to swing your weapon while in VATS? We’ve never been able to power swing in VATS but now it’s happening so 50% of the time I can’t regular swing as well
---
That's a popular spot. Are you having trouble finding a server that doesn't already have that spot occupied?
---
You may call that Duct Tape junk, but he calls it treasure.
---
I'm fanatical about pipe revolvers, they're cheap and easy to make, readily available at early level to scrap for mods, and use the 2nd most plentiful ammo. Plus most people think they're ugly so there's a good chance if they ever/already have fixed them dropping as legendary, you'll be able to find one fairly cheap and easy.
---
"Got confused for a bit trying to find the exit to the surface though."
---
You can fast travel from within buildings in case you didn't know. Unless you're a RPer that just walks everywhere ignore this.
---
Ah rip, I am on ps4
---
I’d recommend coming back, I love this game.
---
Unfortunately if you don’t want too much frustration, I’d only use rifles
---
For me it felt good since beta. I used to play vanila wow so i don't cry over few lags and yeah on PS4 game is waaaaaay smoother. But it is basicaly another online grindfest like every rpg. It depens on you if you like it.
---
I switched to survival at around level 30 because I was tired of slap damage, if people pvp on adventure than at least on survival I can get the jump on them lol. I still love this game but I do get stomped in almost every pvp encounter
---
Happens all the time. Melee has been broken
---
Yeah it’s been happening to me really badly since this last patch. Was about to post about it.
---
What?  What?
---
Is it really faster?  How? Why?
---
It's to discuss the game. Not ask for a full recap every 20 minutes.
---
yeah - i even went south along west side of spruce knob and that's a dense area still. I would like a pond i can get purified water from to make meds from. Looks like i'm going to have to move like you did, it's just a bitch if someones camp is within a football field of your's, that you have to server jump so many times to get it back or give in and rebuild.
---
“Happy blowing” that’s what she said
---
You can come to my camp. I sell 100% fusion cores for 100 caps... that is a pretty easy way!
---
They really need to reference this in game somehow. Especially today.
---
The water one was actually the easiest. Had a scorch kill me in the shallow water in front on the church in the more. If you pick deeper water it just makes navigating harder. 👍
---
I've noticed since the last maintenance buttons I press are not registering, mostly reload and stim pack this may also be my controller but it's relatively new.
---
That could be something. Alas I'm an Xbox peasant, so something official would be nice.
---
It's for pvp so you can melt people into ash piles, the people buying these guns are the same people in full assassins sentinels at lv50 and feel like they are "smart" for abusing every exploit up to the moment it gets patched.
---
Ah okay. Currently I was selling everything for 1 cap each. 
---
This also resulted people buying it all, which isn’t a bad business either tho. 
---
Thanks for the help bud
---
Happens on PC as well. I've been seeing it since around Patch 8, or just before.
---
My psn is BirdJP19
---
It’s only been happening to me since this last patch
---
Someone needs to start a service for this ,.. say something like charge people ammo or something that can be dropped in a bag
---
Made a post myself about the problems that have arisen post-Patch 9, glad to see others are too so we can raise awareness and get a hotfix pronto.
---
How about instead they let us rent vending machine stalls at a central area like Whitespring. First come first serve for that server, you click on a stall and "rent" it for an hour or two, or until you sign out, for a set number of caps. 
---
Once rented, your store becomes available from that stall for the duration of your rental period. When time runs out you get a pop-up to rent more time or let it expire.
---
There's like 300 recordings. 
---
Alot of them talk about being "victorious" and "there's still many more rounds to go"
---
I've got a stack of 15 or so, it won't let me do anything with them either
---
they should monetize it..
---
2 slots for free.. then 75 atoms per slot up to 5 slots
---
tied to each character not the account overall..
---
For a general collection of commonly used materials visit the bunkers in The Mire. Just know most of them are part of the main quest.
---
Ever go to step into a shower to realize afterwards there is no hot water? Yeah....those are not screams of pain, the vault dweller is pissed he just got hosed down with cold water.
---
That would upset me just a bit...
---
It sounds like you're describing Whitesprings.....monsters always level to the players in the vicinity and there are always high level players there. 
---
I remember being in the same situation as you. I arrived at the North gate, got told by an assaultron "the grounds were not secure" and literally seconds later had been murdered by a pack of ghouls...so that assultron was not wrong...
---
I died a lot then and soon I had no stimpacks and my guns and armour were all broken just like for you....the game has a way of showing you that you're out of your depth...so I didn't go there again until I was level 45+. If you know where the "safe" areas are in WS you can also survive at lower levels, tag away to your hearts content and level fast as well.
---
You have more hope of survival in the rest of the forest, the south bit of the toxic valley and parts of the ash heap as well, but anywhere else will be....challenging
---
The next level has a couple broken ones, too. None of the musician ones register, “Deathclaw hides” don’t exist, and I don’t know if it’s possible to get a picture of a Vertibird robot.
---
If they have a beam focuser or most tip mods will turn them back to red.
---
The nuclear waste clean up one toi??
---
I've been playing solo since beta.
---
Repaired or broken? My broken one was in my junk tab. I had to put it in my stash so I could scrap all junk without losing it.
---
 :) So you're ignoring the other half of my post :)  
---
:) But that's ok :) You can act like you're the only :) person to figure out :) how to not fully die :) when you're trying to help with a :) revive :) daily or :) challenge :)
---
I didn't :) need to keep my under armor :) on, and I popped a Rad-X to suppress mutations. :) It  worked fine. :)
---
:) :) :)
---
But thats discussing the game regardless if its repeated every 20 minutes
---
There aren't. Prove it if you're so certain. Otherwise stop claiming things you can't prove.
---
It couldn’t hurt to submit a ticket. I’m hoping they’ll give us fast travel mats because this seems to be a really common issue.
---
Just slightly. The worst part being you have to scrap ultracite pistols/rifles to get mods for it, making what you want a bit more tedious. There’s a few people out there that have all the mods who can do it for you though.
---
I’ve played all of my 800 plus hours solo and have completed every quest as if it were a single player game, you don’t need to team up with other people it’s just an option.
---
&gt; but the maps I made are in the public domain
---
Dubious -- they're derived from Bethesda copyright information.
---
I’ve played solo 800hrs, it’s doable and still fun.
---
For the ventribot go to Grafton Steel Workshop, and fix the Helipad, and summon one! 
---
It sucks you need to be so close to the thing you want to take a photo of, even with zoom.
---
Almost home now. Mine is GunzAblazzzin
---
Definitely feels like Fallout and more. 76 is like if you finished Fallout 4, but instead of making a new character and starting a different playthrough you kept playing. Also there's more ways to play than previous Fallouts, can even do things you weren't able to in previous games. Personally I always wanted to be a trader and run a store to sell off the excess loot from my adventures. Guess what I can do now?
---
Are you available now?
---
Heh... he plays with himself.
---
Z3 SXSW3w
---
Looking for a broken one. I accidentally scrapped the one off Ansel. 
---
For the second day, I'm gonna stop playing 76 because of this and play Rocket league. 
---
I just want a back back. Half the challenges are bugged or require a camera. Driving me nuts.
---
Everyone should think about where to olace their CAMP unit.
---
If i remember correctly, youll always spawn east of that unit. So go in build mode, pick up your camp module and place it somewhere else in your camp.
---
Fast travel to your own camp and see where it spawns you.
---
Got mine somewhere so everyone spawns in front of my camp and inmediatly sees my vending machines :)
---
How do you check that ? I've seen people say there luck is or there charisma is but never new how to check it .. I'm on a PC
---
they usually go to where the enemy spawned. i kited a 3* all around white spring to take it to another player. when i went to loot it, it disappeared. went back to where i first saw it, and there was the body
---
just sent a request!
---
Prices/demand m in wow aren’t completely inelastic, even though they seem like they should be.
---
I'll be on later this evening. Will you be on then?
---
That’s funny and well played, I think I just blasted him because I didn’t take the time to process what was happening...They should have made him much higher level...
---
Copied this like to paste it on these posts as well, Thanks for sharing this. Gets old answering the same question over and over
---
I have over 400 loose gears I sell for 2 ea
---
Does nobody else see the literal arcs of electricity flick around the character?
---
On the market sub you could probably get 1k for a vampire 50 cal. In a vending machine I’d prob list it at 500 or 750. It’s a solid gun for that effect so don’t low ball yourself too much unless you really just want it gone
---
Is there definitely not a "request desktop site" option from where you're viewing? Also in Imgur what if you view one image at a time?
---
Much appreciated
---
Sent
---
I always spawned in the same spot,but now sometimes I spawn in my house or between a wall and the cliff my house is built against.
---
Thanks for the help
---
Okay copy, thanks. I think I am a little ways off from that.
---
+caan +caan +caan
---
Agreed. Plugging Washington Post as a source. smgdh
---
Yeah I've just come to this realisation lol
---
I have 120 but I cant vendvthem because I need to cary them for the batteries included weight reduction. They will kill my stash.
---
All because I used to have a decent gatling plasma, which seems to have gone on walkabout.
---
Nuka quantum grenades have the power advantage over other grenades, but they have a ridiculously small explosive  radius. Your Nuka Quantums are better spent used as a normal aid or for Nukashine. Nuka grenades have high damage, radiation damage, and a larger explosive radius than other grenades.
---
Yeah maybe that's what I don't like. Also played vanilla WoW and loved it but I don't know if I have the time and mentality for the grind anymore.
---
Welp, I just put it in my vending machine for a farely high price as a decor, someone brought it lol
---
No rush man, will add you now
---
Perfect. Thanks
---
That could work, though that would straddle the line on their "cosmetic only" promise for atoms, though it's no worse than repair kits, so par for the course I suppose.
---
Worse for me. Not only am I introverted, I'm also away on vacation and won't get to play until this Friday. While everyone else has moved on, I'll just be killing myself in shallow water again and again, waiting for some kindly stranger to take pity on me.
---
Google a video for the fallout 4 conduits. They work the same way. That's how I figured out how to use them.
---
Between melee weapon weight perks and my 4 pieces of armor the reduce weapon weight every melee weapon weighs under 2# it’s amazing
---
Add me when you get back from vacation and I'll be happy to help out.
---
Inventory tracking at point of sale....nah it will never catch on
---
Whitesprings
---
You don’t even need to scroll down. Scroll all the way up instead to select your name (above the three tabs)
---
Wait, headlamps have a crafting recipe? I thought they were mods only.
---
You can solo this game all you want, you might run in to the occasional player but it doesnt matter.
---
Says you’re offline?
---
you can solo, or group, either way it doesnt matter.. as another said there are only two things you cant really solo unless you are absolutely pimped out gear and perk wise, and when those events pop up others will come.. and you dont have to team or even talk to or communicate with them if you dont want to.   
---
some content would prolly be a lil rough solo but as soon as you hit 45-50 and get decent end game gear it gets alot easier, once you hit 80-90 and are fully perked out and having your qol perks and all that set everything pretty much cake walk time.   
---
you can go 1 to 100 and never talk to, interact, or play with anyone if you didnt want to. and it has always been like this. even in beta. in beta i made it from 1 to 25 and didnt run with anyone.. awhile back i made a melee character and solod her from 1 to roughly 70ish. 
---
this game has never been a "you have to group/party to progress". its an option if you want to..
---
people that are or have complained the game is to hard are trying to do content above their level or above their gear and ability level. you run around in non legendary armor with basic pipe pistols goin into level 40 areas at lvl 35 or under, ya gonna get ya ass handed to you and sent back to your camp. you can level up fast in this game but as you level if you dont take stock of what your wearing and its gear level youre gonna hit a wall get pissed and quit..  
---
i cant tell you how many times ive run into a lvl 30-40 complaining about being forced to group and hating this game for being "too hard" and when you check their gear, they runnin in level 5 to 10 plain leather, with maybe a level 20 basic weapon.. because they spent all their time running and shooting thinking thats all there is in this game.
---
Hope You enjoy The video.
---
Here you are not in guild that have timed raids atleast, so you can grind when you want.
---
Puts in a couple hours, decides game isn't "deep enough" lol ok.
---
Sorry changed it now
---
X-01’s only.
---
the only problem i have found with the mutation is if a player attacks you it sets it off and damages you unless they have fixed that.
---
I’m having someone login for me to check my stash see what I have
---
You appear as offline
---
Not really, but I’ll build one in your camp if you have the materials
---
One spawns in Uncanny Caverns and I've heard the tourist can spawn at Miner Monument.
---
I borked this up myself when I first did it.
---
It has an actual definition.
---
"A griefer or bad faith player is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game, using aspects of the game in UNINTENDED ways."
---
He chose not to shoot an enemy, and just sit there. No one is obligated to protect your base. Is it nice to? Yes but choosing not to shouldn't make you a griefer.
---
I’m on Xbox and I’m at work till 7 if so add me and that would be amazing. Gt is zombie9 hunter
---
It’s great and I have waaaay too much time invested. Not a fan of the constant server disconnects though 💁‍♂️
---
I agree with how it could be exploited.
---
All it would take is for a player to throw a 20 weight into their vending machine and charge 25k caps, knowing nobody will buy it just for storage.
---
Good idea, but didn't work. Looks like I'll have to trek back out there after re-doing the Signal quest.
---
I'm hopping on in the next ten minutes or so if you wanna knock it out.
---
It’s easier solo. Just don’t take your time picking kindling. If it’s damp it spawns more bugs when you pick it and puts the fire out when you put it on the fire.
---
It's for the free range public event.

while furious is perfect for high rate of fire weapons... you pair that anti-armor with stabilized perk and you will shred.  fire rate increase is awesome as well. gotta keep the 2\*.
---
I don’t think it does. I know it doesn’t affect the vendor bots for sure. The only problem I’ve had is that it hurts my camps fertilizer Brahmin.
---
I thought it was grammatically correct but wasn’t sure. 
---
I wish I didn’t care if a stranger on the internet referred to me in passing as a “he.”
---
I wish I had a middle finger emote for the fuckhole who just showed up for Free Range, killed the brahmin then killed the Sheepsquatch in its hole so nobody could get any loot. Or an immediate murder button. One of the two.
---
I just failed this one twice and I dunno why
---
I'm good now, sorry. My LAN connection was being funny so I had to switch to wifi. Omw
---
I try to take only the dry kindling but most of the time when I lose it's because the fire is out 'cause those ass mosquitos push me far from the fire
---
No doubt it's a dick move, however griefing would be something like claiming a workshop and killing the guy while he's at his camp. Purifiers are FAR from expensive as well. Not to mention both of them were there, ghouls could have spawned because of either one. I just think calling anyone who's not out to help the world a griefer is just toxic.
---
I haven't tried that yet but, thanks for the heads up. I won't move my boxes till its fixed.
---
A lot.
---
Nerfs, buffs, fixes, glitches, missions and backpacks.
---
There's a roadmap of the game on the official site.
---
*Laughs in pneumatic armor.*
---
someone needs to test the psn damage by getting psn resis on all armor slots and doing a comparison.
---
It seems every time I’m at the white springs vendors at least one of them has the crossbow plans. Never failed me
---
Indeed they didn't. Hopefully really soon.
---
Do you realize that the definitions of words are not objective?  Also if someone knows that enemies attack a base and use their presence to trigger damage to a base, I would argue that this fits your definition - as the intent of the targeting parameters is to motivate defense of the camp - not to amuse onlookers.
---
SBQ and Sheepsquatch come to mind. The new Campfire Tales has a low level, too.
---
Dang man I’m PS4.  And I’d imagine by the time some sort of cross play exists you’d be  far along lol
---
Are you going to substantiate any of your claims?
---
Any more asylum outfits?
---
I failed before I knew about the wet kindling. Now I’m just extra careful and no extra bugs appear. Before I was just collecting it as quick as I could and often picking the wet up too.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. This is a Fallout76 subreddit anyways. Take your naive liberal brainwashed ass outta here and go to a political subreddit. 
---
You've been watching too many liberal media news outlets. Stop pretending to know what you're talking about.
---
Can you join in on me? Might have to get off soon
---
Do you have the electrically charged mutation? I have a theory that the mist functions as a 'hit' with no damage and a -rads effect, which makes your character grunt and triggers the mutation. I don't know for sure though.
---
Nothing in that post helps. It does point towards the roadmap yet I wanted a summary of the most important things for a quick read.
---
I just cannot understand people complaining this game isn't deep or immersive. It just tells me nobody reads notes, reads terminals or listens to holotapes. I mean, if you are too impatient to read or listen, and need to be spoon fed through cut scenes and NPCs, then so be it. This will never be your game. 
---
It is a new way of delivering a story, but there are hundreds of stories being told. That early quest for the nanny bot? looking for the lost kid? I mean come on...
---
We’ve been posting about this almost daily since launch. It really needs to happen so have an upvotey thing.
---
Wow! I’ve been on that train many, many times and never noticed it!
---
If you are on PS4 give me your PSN i will lend you carry capacity mod plan so you do t have to grind.
---
In the meantime, can you favorite the item to prevent auto scrapping?
---
Ah, I was unaware that there were THAT many recordings that could be listened too. I guess we will have to see what Bethesda does, and it's a hope that they don't make a sub par gamemode.
---
I just look at the default prices and laugh they're ridiculous. I sell all my plans at 2 caps because like said it's free caps.
---
Blue and pink! The pink is going to go for quite a bit cause that one was my favorite, but alas, I need the stash space 💔
---
How much?
---
A couple hours? I'd say I put close to 24 hours into the game, I don't think that's negligible. It's no secret that this game is not so deep in storyline and questing as previous titles were, which I was a huge fan of.
---
C'mon buddy, I'm just trying to get a community picture of the current state of the game as someone who needs to be selective with my limited gaming time.
---
Oh wow. Thanks for the offer. Am planning on the armor mod though, and also just generally want to complete it myself. Did the plan drop for you or did you reach possum? If possum what badges?
---
??
---
Nvm it activated
---
In my honest opinion, I think people are crazy for putting it off this long. People should catch up ASAP so they can actually partake in the new content without grinding levels first. Is playing it  now a popular opinion? No, other than on this sub. So you’ll still get made fun of by your friends, but if you’re enjoying it who cares. However, if you thought it was boring back then, I don’t know if you’ll be swayed in its current state
---
Just use the slider it literally takes about 3 seconds
---
Blue for 5k, pink for 7.5k
---
No definitions are not subjective. Words have meanings, to use them incorrectly because "that's what I think it means" doesn't change it.  Unless you can prove the guy trailed enemies to his base with the intent of allowing them to destroy his base, it's not griefing. The mobs could have spawned due to either player, and no unintended mechanics are being using. Enemy sees a base, it attacks a base. Works as it should.
---
To call someone a griefer over something so small just sounds salty.
---
For me the biggest building issues are
---
1 Being unable to remove walls/floors/stairs. If the game really thinks it's necessary to keep, give us a prompt to confirm the removal anyway. Players can already break the laws of physics. I often feed stairs up and back down just to build a porch of floors that run flush with the foundations I started with. Being able to remove the stairs after would be wonderful. I can only imagine how many other ways this could be useful.
---
2 Having a cramped CAMP budget for anything that's over ~1500sqft and well decorated. The hopeful part of me says they've pushed decorating back to optimize CAMPs so they can increase the budget a smidge more when it is released. I could really use another 10% myself, especially if the magazines and stuffed animals take up budget.
---
3 Connecting wires can be finicky and lead to you jumping up and down instead of being able to place a wire. I sometimes run in to this 50% of the time and it can double the time spent  connecting wires for the entire CAMP. Issues with advanced connectors floating definitely compound this problem. 
---
4 Can we get some fucking rounded corner and triangle floor pieces, and the half width and curved walls to go with it? Everyone is a box. We will find a ton of ways to make that box cool, but come on.
---
Thank you. I appreciate it.
---
Dang I know I’m putting so much time into it. It’s a great game
---
is this true?
---
They messed up several camp items....even crops now snap below the ground mesh when you place them elsewhere and not with their stem on the ground
---
I grinded 17badges already :D do event:campfire tales server hoping
---
Btw carr capacity is only bugged and you learn it upon picking so i can lend it to you for secon for free, depends on you if you enjoy that grind :))
---
Happened a few times already. Also had some crashing when trying to fast travel to a camp.
---
Well.. There goes my retirement-plan..
---
There isn't a single player "mode". you join a server. that is the game and will always be the game. Fallout 76 is an online multiplayer game. 
---
You do not have to play with other people and never have had to. a handful of things help to have friends for, but even that is not required.
---
Little much. Would u do 10k for both?
---
Well done.......
---
i would assume thats what their plans are for the opening of some of the vaults, there are still issues in the game that have not been covered or completed yet, several dealing with the other vaults and the dwellers that were in them, like the mire and the parasitic plant infestation in the region. vault 51 added in the northwest corner. vaults in the ash heap and so on, those will eventually be opened and end game content added for those..   
---
we just had the burrows added (granted no real boss yet, but doesnt mean another cant be added later), and we still have the arktos pharma dungeon that was shown in pax east preview thats still on its way into the game.
---
Hard to tell, especially since 76 is 4x larger than FO4. 
---
My gut says that RDR2 is larger but that could be for lack of fast travel. Then again, you always have a horse in RDR2 where you're either walking or fast traveling in 76. 
---
I heard a podcast that said that 2 particular locations (IRL) were about 45 minutes apart but were relatively close to one another on the 76 map. Google tells me it's about a 3 1/2 hour drive from Point Pleasant to Watoga.
---
Based on that, and that and also that St. Denis is clearly in bayou country and there are snowy mountains (Colorado?) as well, that RDR2 is technically larger.
---
Jon Bon Pony just runs REALLY fast.

Looks like mine is bugged. Took photos at both spots, about 5 at each. Got the Fossil indicator in the view finder but never marked as complete in the challenge :(
---
Thanks for sharing the info though. Now I know where fossils are when i am able to complete the task.

Here is my prices:

Ok, thank you for the info.

Bullshit troll
---
Still surprised they haven't added a deathclaw boss
---
Stop being an idiot in public.
---
Speaking of the crossbow plans, did anyone have trouble picking them up? Every time I go to the range it's there on the table but I can't pick it up and then it just disappears
---
Sounds just fine!
---
Because it was false information. There are a visual glitch. The transaction work as intended, but not the notification.
---
That's a special.....2000k..... lol
---
K on my way!

I know they seem to prioritize my scarecrow, so I use it to lure enemies into an ideal firing position for my turrets.

Sweet! I'm at my camp, holding the uniforms

Did you try inside Uncanny Caverns?
---
Was your weapon drawn?
---
Thank you! Cool base!
---
Just a problem with the notification. The transaction was done correctly.
---
Have you tried to buy a set of plans from a vendor recently?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if there's some weird shit on the back end where a server gets stuck on a particular legendary effect for some reason. No idea how or why it would happen but it's the kind of thing that wouldn't shock me in a Bethesda game.
---
How the hell do you get near max caps? I cant get near 1000
---
I've also heard them say things like "take this!" when they're attacking with melee and stuff like "next time" when i have managed to get out of  \[danger\] and into \[caution\]
---
Np. Thank u
---
I never said I didn't do this type of stuff. My favorite quest I had played through was the mansion one where you had to wear the veil and get into the basement, etc etc.
---
I enjoyed the game in the hours I'd played it, but dying to bugs, the general loneliness in the game, and the lack of story player choices drove me away. Hell, I couldn't even get the game to track quests properly when playing in a group.
---
The decontamination shower is an endgame item, unless you get 5 of each flux, and kill the SBQ, ur not gonne get it
---
You’re own words do that. You want more and easier ways to get Atoms because you feel your owed that because of how much you’ve played the game.
---
Now come back with some reply like you don’t understand or whatever. 
---
What’s hilarious is you think this is something your going to get. 
---
Like Bethesda is going to do things your way so they can’t make money. 
---
Right?! I mean I really don't feel like playing Xbox musical chairs. Especially after being in a car for 8 hours. But this Bethesda hate is comical at this point.
---
I agree that they're too rare, dense mods are the shit though.
---
Got it yesterday. This is... disappointing. I have only like 150 caps and i cant afford like any building plans so I cant even get the stove blueprint.
---
I keep hoping this is the first thing they fix everytime I know a patch is coming
---
Scam
---
Yes. There was not wipe before. I play only because i have connection to my 620hours old character.
---
There is no reason to wipe it. That would make lots of people to stop playing.
---
Lots of good suggestions. Only perk I’d add that helps out from time to time is mysterious savior. Decent chance to revive after dying
---
I've never played with anyone else online on this game. You can play it solo perfectly fine
---
Make sure the scorched beast mane is appearing in the viewfinder. It should say scorched beast or whatever you are taking a picture of in the right if the view finder

You're not wrong but damn are you a high and mighty asshole.  Go ahead and downvote this, wont change that fact.

I only have it on one armour slot, but I know even that's enough for mirelurk queens' acid spray to go from "Kills me in two or three hits" to "Barely tickles." Which is of course why I have it. =P

The first time, no. The next time I was helping I'll mutants. And even in my base; a guy came to visit my store and my turrets were poppin off at him. I felt bad.
---
Oh wow ty
---
You must be extra close. Do deathclaw, thats easier..
---
It’s a genuine question, check my other posts and you’ll see that I’m a massive fan of the franchise and don’t post bullshit. Now stop being a prick and get a life.
---
Even with easily tripping a server back then, you had to act intentionally to reap the rewards of duping
---
As a PA wearer 99% of the time, I call BS on that person. I have accidentally slipped into a fissure during SBQ fights and it is instant death and all junk is lost. There is no option to go back for it.
---
Do you need help? I got mine done just let me know
---
Competing against whom? Are you talking survival mode? I really could care less what guns other people have beyond being impressed that they have such nice guns. Buy sell trade whatever.  There’s so many ways to play this game and it’s not all duping and getting cap-rich. I’m not competing against anyone when I’m just here playing for myself. It’s taken me 7 months just to get to level 60 so...I’m good.
---
&gt; most important things 
---
I'd have to be inside your head to see what's important to you.  That's kind of the point.
---
That’s why I give ammo away for free

The campfire tales event also yields most of the items you need. I just do this one then stings and wings then back to working on badges.

Leave a sign with a message telling others what you're looking for by your vending machines with instructions to add you to a team if they want to sell you it

Dont bother, this dude is not upset you were wrong, hes projecting what appears to be a lot of anger onto you that was only a small portion of the whole that you caused.

Some redditors just need to be insufferable shits or they fear their heart may stop.

You serious lol?

Why am is troll exactly? It's weird to me that it's this way, just wondered if I'm missing something.

This is happening on PC about ya 30% of the time, so I’m constantly spamming loot after the killing blow. PLZ FIX

I got you. Come to my camp. Sending req
---
500caps is dirt cheap. 
---
Good job, comrad.
---
But it get worse each time
---
I think it would be. Most of us don't care about pvp, so the fact that the balance there is completely fucked isn't as big of an issue for us. Sure it's annoying to see every other person flying around with duped gear destroying everything in the area, but it doesn't affect us as players much. Many of us already have hundreds of hours in the game and don't want to see all of that gone for something that marginally affects us. The dupers and pvp players are almost already playing on a different server now, as there's such a disconnect between them and the average player base. Look at all the threads here asking about prices for things, look at the shock of people seeing that a legendary can sell for more than a couple thousand caps. These groups stay so far away from each other that a wipe doesn't seem necessary. Ban the cheaters, remove the duped gear, we know now that bethesda has the tools for it, that's the best and simplest solution.
---
With that said, if our current progress remained intact, I wouldn't mind an additional new server that allowed everybody to start from scratch with newer versions of the game. I'd imagine that would have some appeal to it
---
Quantum Grenades can almost be safely used indoors.
---
Yeah it should, but it isnt
---
I haven't tried it but the gist was dropping ( as opposed to placing) a frame in fissure then standing on it's shoulders or some such.
---
I actually was curious what someone in survival was selling. Walked up, no gun drawn, and the turrets still opened fire while the owner 1 shit me.
---
The same way a bidet sprays down my booty hole?
---
But did he apologize for fighting dirty?
---
These items would be much less obtainable if they weren’t duped. So you’re two points are contradicting. Fact is if these items weren’t duped tses would be going for 50-100k
---
I might just be competetive in nature. Hard to tell from my perspective.
---
Gotcha. Sometimes it is the angle or distance. I had to adjust a few times for a dam rabbit....lol
---
Let alone items that are much better than tse.
---
I didn’t leave anything - just walked away. I think he got distracted by a Radtoad attack
---
What does Sent/ass gear have to do with any of that?
---
Notice how I wasnt in my first comment. If someone doubles down on being wrong yeah I'm going to talk down to them. Then theres you. You're just a whiny little bitch. I explained how their post was wrong and even posted the link for the website they were using. He even apologized a little further down. So the only one being a cunt here is you.
---
I can’t find that quest to start it anywhere. Can’t fight the sheepsqatch either at the pylons. Just never appear on the server
---
i need to get it on some armor pieces then so i won't be scared of legendary bugs lol
---
I spawned in and moved to try move out of the building before it spawned in. I ended up moving into their locked house, it was very nice to look around though and got to scrap some junk whilst I was there!
---
It's a real let down to be enjoying this game then come across a frustrating thing like that, I had to leave in the end as I couldn't get the photo
---
Sure thanks just joined your server and sent you an invite thanks !
---
That’s great but you can’t get flux in the Forrest since you can’t nuke it

https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=57555fe&amp;d=s61sg2p02p10pb2eh2ep1c41c81ib4ad2ak2al2a30a04la2l71lt2lk2lv2&amp;w=c72c62cu2cm2ic4pe2s01lu2&amp;n=&amp;m=12589cef   This is is what I use. The not selected perks are ones I regularly would switch in and out of depending on activity. It is prioritized for killing big things and survival. I stack all the luck boosts I can find through food when playing for even more crits, without food buffs every 3rd shot can crit with lots it’s every other shot. I run an explosive western revolver as my primary, .44 is cheaper and easier to find but does have less damage. My backup is the survival legendary .44(blanking out on the name). So I dont blow through all my .44 ammo I use pipe revolver or a 10mm on trash enemies. As far as gear you do not want anything 2shot as you will just miss in vats(also let the revolver come to rest before you fire it otherwise you could also miss 95% shots for no reason.) you probably want a bloody or AA western revolver with perks like crit damage/reduced vats cost/explosive/criticyhits charge faster. If you get a critical charge faster you could probably drop crit savvy and pick up on of the other luck perks. I run bolstering armor and don’t leave myself one shot all the time, I let the extra armor and serendipity keep me alive while I stimpack. I use lemonade/hard lemonade/possum bacon/blight soup/corn soup for crit/luck/ao boosts.
---
That really does suck. Sorry man.
---
Yea I did that, like you then I learned the hard truth here. Oh and to stay on the subject, yea you can still earn badges with the event!
---
Automatically loot upon killing something would be appropriate.
---
In terms of dps, I think the anti-armor and fire rate will always be better. I don't know for sure how high furious stacks, but at the peak of its damage bonus it will be slightly worse or marginally better than any shot from the anti-armor fire rate one.
---
That is great! I wonder if you can nuke the gorge junkyard as that seems to be one of the few places that has a good quantity of everything.
---
Explosives FTW  
---
Can't hit me if I blast it with so much explosive physics that they actually fly to the other side of town.
---
I mentioned this right after the patch and got downvoted. Yes, it has changed, I don't do any serums or mutations or anything and I noticed it right off. I have both PC and XB1, PC is far worse, jus saying...
---
If your'e on PC, I believe I still have 1 or 2 plans for them for sale in my shop.
---
I will agree that our infrastructure and drug epidemic is poor but your reasoning is flawed.  
---
1. more money doesn't help bad teachers and the crap they are forced to teach.  California is teaching children about pedophilia an a sexual preference. Wasting money on woke Sex ed is Criminal.
---
2. As a recovering addict who used programs (medicaid, food stamps)the govt programs do nothing but incentivize people to stay on that program.
---
 2a. Because I graduated high school I didn't qualify for welfare to work program. (which was a joke and not at all mandatory) But I could stay unemployed and keep getting food stamps and cash for 5+ years. 
---
2b. No Id is required for Food stamp cards so I can sell food stamps for heroin and my dealer would have a stack of them on his coffee table.
---
3. Millions of children are abused annually by their parents and strangers by being forced to the border as an insurance policy or sex slave.  You never blame the adults who bring them to our border it's always the orange man's fault. 
---
You are a classic NPC and I hope you get a firmware update soon. Or you'll spend you life saying "I used to be a (social justice)  warrior,  then I took an arrow to the knee). SMH
---
Yeah, that's why i spitballed the idea of a legacy server. If you like flying around one shotting everything in the area, cool. But if i was trying to do simething in that area i need to wait for respawns now. It wouldn't be a problem if those items were actually scarce. It also take away the feeling i get when i found a decent item. By comparison a bs or even just explosive wasn't really competetive with what i could just buy
---
+karma ty
---
This sub has a truth problem when it comes to bugs and this game. It drives me a little nuts. Lol to all the PC players claiming it's harder to capture footage than us on console. You've had the tech a lot longer than us console plebs have!
---
its probably your level. last time i tried to hold Posiedon i was level 30, and after the first hoard i was destroyed by a lvl 200-ish with some kinda exploding shotgun. they are probably just waiting for lower levels to try and claim it, and don't attack if you are around your level. kinda sucks tbh
---
They didn't, they just deleted copies of the same equipment on the same character and left them with 1. They can't tell through code which item is duped, they only look and see there is 8000 laser rifles with bloodied, explosive, reload speed and go "hmmmm"
---
I just picked 76 back up again. However I never had any problems or encountered too many bugs when it originally came out so I always enjoyed it. I think it’s definitely in a better place. I haven’t experienced all of the changes or even know exactly what they all are. What i can say is that I’m really enjoying survival mode and the random people pvp encounters. The player shops are really cool IMO. It gives more of a reason to visit people camps and some players put a lot of time and effort into their shops and make them look super awesome.
---
Thanks! :)
---
+karma man! Even though it doesnt work in this sub haha
---
NO. Stop spreading false info
---
I did spitball the idea of a legacy server for that reason pretty much. You can keep your favorite characters and keep playing on then or experience them again once in awhile
---
It was fine right from the get go. You succumbed to the massive Fallout 76 is crap meme.
---
 Its better, and getting mo better as time goes by.
---
Oh shit hahaha my bad!
---
Yes, the thirst bar is absolutely draining quicker. Also, with the Speed Demon mutation, you have to drink every few minutes.
---
What a ridiculous statement.
---
It's not your fault unless you knew before hand, this is all down to Bethesda not expecting people to share!
---
About of 500 pound XXL shirt wearing fatass melee builds run around and kill randoms. Everybody is immersed so they don't talk at all and are anti social. A bunch of dup exploits ruined the game and now the only people playing it are them.
---
My bad wasnt near my system but since I'm bloodied it might take a couple tries lol
---
What is?

You're a real winner.  I'm betting you're the kid mom isnt mad doesn't call on mothers day.  Lord knows if you were my kid I'd rather not have such a hateful shit remind me they are my son.

Go get help you psycho fuck.  Seriously.
---
That’s the truth my I was on the middle lake and my buddy had to be all the way up top at the first lake it was crazy. I went north, some good spots out there with little ponds and lakes, but with this new camp format you could probably do better getting a resource node and putting down the small purifiers.  I found an acid node and it was the best choice ever.
---
Much appreciated!
---
Glad to see im not the only one thats noticed.
---
Just to make sure you didn't mean it this way: Unyielding does *not* boost END.  
---
It actually says something to the effect of "Increase all stats (except END) the lower your health".

I double checked that last night after seeing my END was only +9 (total) with the Underarmor considering my health was so low. Resulted in an internalized "oh, right... duh" lol
---
Is it networked synced ie can everyone else hear it when you use it?
---
You're trying to set up a straw man attack, but it's obvious you're just blowing hot air.
---
Yup. It only happens on occasion, but once was enough to convince my to bring the boom stick.
---
Ok so it’s a cavaliers life saving chest piece
---
Spreading false info?
---
I aint watchin any youtube vids here. Im just personally noticing the bar draining faster.
---
That's kind of assumed knowledge.
---
Nope, I got rid of the on-hit mutations cause I found them annoying
---
Again, lying as a form of argument isn't really looking good on your record, I have never stated I feel like I'm owed atoms, I argued that the system is very flawed if there is no good option but to buy atom, if the amount of time you spend in a game is irrelevant to how much you progress in the game then the game is flawed, especially so if progression is able to be bought
---
And I don't believe I will be able to get bethesda to fix their abysmal anti consumer practices on my own since it is to their own benefit, if nobody complains bethesda gets to do whatever the fuck they want, you could apply your own argument against people complaining about the pay to win aspects that are slowly seeping into the atom shop
---
Example:   
---
Reasonable Person: "Bethesda why are you adding repair kits to the atom shop this is anti consumer"  
---
Your argument: "Haha just stop complaining they wont listen haha"
---
Yeah but it’s marked on the map as flux, definitely not complaining this is a very helpful map I’m just pointing that out
---
Not a bad idea. The server can only have, what? 22 players, so they have 22 places for shops assign or a player can claim a free one and sell their stuff. I’m imagining the festival setup at Lewisburg kinda deal
---
Both hunger and thirst +++ IMO. Have dromedary etc so was never this quick to drop since \~Lvl20
---
Possibly within the exclusion zone around '76, isn't it?
---
We don't need to raise taxes on anyone who earns less than $100,000 a year. We need to change where tax dollars go. 
---
STOP BEING AN IDIOT IN PUBLIC.
---
Tell that to the guy who bought 16000 rounds off me for one cap each.
---
It looks like people have already noted the changes so far but IMO its still not worth the effort unless you just come across something you could tame. They still die from something randomly and players can kill them so with the player vendor shops going on why would you want that. I am still waiting if Bethesda ever fix's or improves on this incomplete system. Hoping they do it one day though, I really like the possibilities.
---
This bug definitely exists, and got me bad when I stored all my decorative clutter to rearrange it. A junk shop with no junk spread around is no good! I hope it gets fixed soon. Can we tag our Bethesda posters on this topic?
---
 You have no idea at all about story line as you never played it, and as well know nothing about what the game is even about, do you?
---
The strange part is that it only happens in doors.
---
On xbox (and I assume ps4) you can give over someone on the map and "send message" appears along with the other options, and it being up an XBL chat window.
---
Hilarious... fun video.
---
The frog habitat is also broken too!
---
But the thing is, the items are being duped. Right? I don't think anyone would be complaining about dupers if they didn't have a material affect on the feel of the game to other players. So I'm just hesitant to jump in bc Beth can seem to patch up their dupe problem. 
---
I just feel like a core part of the game is loot, but if all loot is garbo, where is the hook? I want that feel of finding better and better stuff, but if my good stuff i find is worse than what i can get at most vending stations, there is even less feeling if progress.  Especially post 50. 
---
But i haven't played in awhile, if you're playing now and say it's not a big deal, maybe it isnt.
---
I wont be on for a couple of days but I got it in the imposter sheepsquatch event. But if you haven't got it I'll drop a reply when I figure out when I'm next on.
---
My gripe with duping is that you dupe a bunch of items hundreds of times and yet want me to pay 10-20k caps for them.
---
They also need to fix the fence gate. It never snaps to another fence no matter what you do.
---
That's great, but doesn't seem usual.
---
Obviously the word 'worth' is relative and relates to individual value, but I personally won't be buying any rounds for one cap each when I can buy the materials for less and get xp by crafting them.
---
they are a bit rare and part of the recipe loot table I suspect so if you get your 10th s'mores recipe well, that could have been a badge.
---
What pops up doesn't even matter due to the UI bug.
---
I think radstorms can randomly convert plants into their flux variants, even in the forest, so not entirely pointless.
---
I got my first three star on the weekend...  double barrel with junkie and faster movement speed.... oh well at least it’s good scrip.
---
Really? Thanks for letting me know. Usually I only need a few, I keep my rads cranked up high
---
Can you link to the thread. I cant find it
---
I just hope if it's BR, it's a weird pve variant with survival elements
---
There is more than one bug going on here. Yes there is a known ui bug but there is also a bug on the tax amount.
---
Here's a quick guide to profiting off rumors and lies on this sub! Claim XYZ based on zero evidence or fact but strictly the idea something has changed, then ask everyone if they're experiencing this too. Provide zero evidence, if questioned double down on this, and if asked to provide any said evidence simply shirk the burden of proof and tell *them* to prove you're wrong instead! Works every time...
---
The anti armor one was worthless! XD
---
You must be new
---
Np at all
---
Adding, thx! vdub580
---
I had that issue too, soI just went to Whitesprings and bought them for like 200 caps.
---
Deathclaw Hides do exist, they just don't drop from Deathclaws. I've found exactly one in a random container since the update hit and yes it gave me credit towards the challenge.
---
And it's so fucking annoying
---
If you ever have this problem again, just hop into survival, throw all your junk in your stash, and go run after whoever is in the top 3.
---
Thanks for this. Actually was helpful. I do **want** to want to come back to the game but it was just a disappointment on release for me eventually. A little too lonely and playing with friends, the part I was most excited for, was just so clunky. 
---
May try again soon. Good to hear there are better things coming out of it.
---
I have 5 pieces of fluorescent flux in my vending machine. Adding you now.
---
We have to imagine it
---
I’m here now because of this. Pioneer challenges lol
---
So you telling me survival bases have the same protection as Adventure mode ? That doesn't make sense, I just assumed it would change in survival ... so yeah doesn't make sense at all if the turrets attack you but you can't attack the base without probably getting the owner hostile ..
---
Again the only cunt/psycho fuck is you here. Seriously have you even looked at your post history? All you do is criticize people. What's wrong never got that love from mommy so you gotta act out?
---
This is by far the biggest issue in the game and is killing the economy quicker with player camp vending
---
Then don’t play an online game? There’s gonna be people with better stuff than you. Especially if you barely play. That’s a stupid reason to want a wipe.
---
I personally don’t like that aspect of the games. I don’t enjoy having to go through the terminals and read everything to sus out the storyline. Because most of the time only one entry in the computer actually progresses the storyline. The other entries just give the character personality. That doesn’t mean I don’t like the game but it kind of reminds me of Dark Souls how you have to read every item description to get all the details of the story. I hated that part of the game. But by god does dark souls have a great story.
---
I've got a fairly decent PC build, couldn't tell you shit about it other than it was pretty fucking pricey, but I just preferred a controller/couch/TV. So I don't use it to game. But it came with a default screen recorder.
---
But the whole PC vs Console thing is hilarious to me. 
---
PC players are the vegans of video games.
---
How would you expect me to prove it? I don't have a capture software program on my pc. How about instead you stop acting like you are omnipotent and know everything about where bugs are and aren't. 
---
You seem stuck on the Ui bug, this is a separate bug where the tax is way to high.
---
I know this is 4 months old, but it came up on a google search. I had the same issue, then got the metal signs plan (iirc) and it unlocked.
---
I’ve seen this suggestion so many times that I am getting tired of upvoting every single one.
---
&gt;Bethesda’s incompetence in protecting their own assets is just unfathomable.
---
It is not unfathomable. It's totally fathomable. I fathomed it when I first heard about FO76.
---
Studios that have made multiplayer games since games existed have a hard time dealing with cheaters. To this day. It's a constant game of cat and mouse.
---
Enter Bethesda Studios. A studio with ZERO experience in multiplayer. A studio so naive that they took a non-multiplayer game engine that has been grown organically for at least a decade. An engine that has been bug ridden its entire existence. It is known for it's bugs. And then they bolted multiplayer onto it.
---
What did you expect?
---
Can you prove that? If not, and I don't care what the excuse is, *it shouldn't be hard to at all*, shut up.
---
Where are you getting this impression? The post you are implying to states that I have put probably a day into this game. I knew exactly what it was about, at least shortly after release when I decided to quit.
---
Happened to me when I wasn't paying attention to where I was going and slipped into a fissure.
---
These are not rare-- one SBQ fight and they generally drop. I sell these for half price because they are pretty easy to come by ror higher level players.
---
Theres a cap? That's dumb af
---
List of plans?
---
Thanks :) just joined
---
I'd buy 10,000 5.56 rounds if I saw them at 1 each.
---
 Being level 160 I've done my fair share of farming materials for ammo. With the vendors it's just far easier to purchase them now.  I really don't need caps for much else.
---
Except it is dropping faster so it isn't false, as multiple people have stated.
---
Player value, the serum recipes usually go from 2000-8000, but since the Queen no longer drops them, the price may have gone up!
---
Can you prove all these people wrong? Exactly you can't so kindly take your own advice.
---
Yes, thirst definitely is dropping faster now post patch.
---
Not a whole lot of plans. T45 jetpack for 500, and two T60 motion assist servos plans for 275
---
My wife and I play together regularly, two kids makes it hard but we love this game. I just told her about this and she loved it haha thanks for the info!!
---
Haven't played Adventure since Survival came out. But yeah, armed or holstered, the turrets attack. Lol, those bases with missle launchers are brutal!
---
I would expect you to br competent enough to remember the other poster who already told you how to prove it. Let's be real though, we both know you're not proving anything. Either you're full of it or I'm Santa Claus.
---
The last thing we need is more trolls.
---
Oh, bethesda was talking about season in past, like in diablo, thats what you are asking for basicaly.
---
That’s not true at all.
---
I play with a group of 15 people from the US, UK and Hungary. We are of all ages, types, genders, backgrounds. (And one’s weight has nothing to do with any of this, btw.) We are very close and always have mics on. We are always talking, doing events together, planning silos and events. We do NOT exploit. We do not PvP unless we are attacked first, and even then we really prefer not to. 
---
We enjoy helping new vault dwellers in Flatwoods and at the Overseer’s Camp by giving them ammo and aid. We can also kick some butt at Encryptid and the SBQ. We love the game, we gripe about the bugs like everyone else, but we understand that these things happen and we just laugh it off and enjoy it for what it is.
---
Don’t lump all of us in with the exploiters. Some of us actually enjoy the game and play it appropriately, and make friends. (But yeah, if you’re a griefer asshole, of course you’re not going to have anyone talking to you.)
---
How do they do it ? you can fasttravel to another location if you're stuck
---
I’ve played ark survival evolve for almost three years. I can honestly say that ark has incredible base building mechanics 😁
---
As I explained to him I dont play on Xbox genius.
---
Thanks!  I know about the fast travel thing.    I wanted to see how the real exit worked.   Once I appeared outside the port a potty I fast traveled.
---
Yeah this cant happen. I mean I feel it, I understand it. But that's a step over the line imo. Players cant destroy them if you aren't in PvP and now mobs cant destroy them. Nah. Its the wastes, post-apocalyptic. Mutated creatures and monsters everywhere. Yes they should be able to destroy your crap. This is Fallout, not shop keeping sim.
---
Literally can just buy the best gun in the game. That's the problem. There is no one with a better gun. We all have the same gun. No upgrades or progession.
---
 I wanted to discuss the game, not waste my time on a dumb fuck who thinks his gun size compensates for his peanut dick.
---
Have you moved a lot of inventory?
---
This particular glitch was discovered a few months ago and a previous patch fixed it. For whatever reason, Patch 9 reverted the fix.
---
You’re acting like Sent/ass is some abusive crazy thing, and it’s not nearly as common as you want to think it is.
---
Lmao. You're basic and can't understand the burden of proof. I'm not the one claiming there's a bug that somehow can't be recorded despite it being *really obviously easy* to duplicate at any time.
---
I need to do the revive/revive water thing too on PC. IGN derReisende
---
You don't have to pick the cards up each time you do the event. Just FYI the first time you pick up the cards they will work forever.
---
Oh do I need to do this from my pc &amp; not my phone? I can tap on each map 1 by 1 but it didn't make them so I could zoom /pan
---
It's much easier if you make a doorway, connect the wires and change it into a wall.
---
Sounds like you are, but this isn’t a competitive game if you stick to adventure. It doesn’t matter what other weapons other players have really. And “the economy” was ruined a long time ago when people started thinking it was justified to charge more than the max cap for legendaries. It’s just now starting to return to normal with everyone setting whatever prices they personally feel legendaries (and everything else) are worth. Probably just play the game before coming up with radical ideas like wiping everyone’s progress just cause they might have better weapons than someone just starting out.
---
Good idea. More adequate servers are preferable but until that day comes I can certainly settle with a simple notification.
---
They said in one of the recent Inside the Vault that they are tweaking it so it works properly when they finally release it.
---
Ok. My camp is north of camden park 👍
---
Yeah, if they discussed it, I must have missed it. I've been trying to keep my finger on the pulse of the game.
---
I just want a damn crossbow in need of a repair!
---
I was on a server last night that had 6 or 7 camps scattered along the road between the Overseer camp and Flatwoods. It was like a virtual Shakedown Street.
---
Sounds good!
---
Yes the burden of proof is on you for coming in here doubting multiple people some with video. So it on you to disprove them.
---
Get it down to low health with another weapon then bash it to death with the syringer. Still counts lol
---
You only need the killing shot with the syringer, take it down to almost dead then switch weapons. Hope this helps.
---
I gave up getting vats perks because of this. Good bye grim reapers Sprint
---
A tip: it doesn’t HAVE to be a Yao guai, as any large animal mob should work. I shot the weapon at a honeybeast on my way to the Yao Guai location, just to see how it worked and got a notice from Rose that while not exactly what she as after, that was good enough.
---
How to trigger leader of the pack event fo76
---
Holy shit.
---
It refers to explosive energy weapons that no longer drop. People who found them before they were discontinued are still able to use/trade them but since no new ones will drop from enemies right now they’re considered “legacy” ie retired.
---
So it seems the problem is the camp is still loading in for you. I have found if I get stuck, map out and then map back over it will load fine. Granted this is a shoddy workaround that costs caps. They need to fix it. I personally think the should just add a function to the camp machine where you can just set the spawn you want. Screw door mats.
---
From what I've read, the servers naturally bcap at 24 people, but if you're in a team you can invite people and push it to a hard cap of 30.
---
Agreed. The game is great, and has always been. It has bugs just like any other game, but they have been working to fix them. They have been releasing constant content, they have been listening to our suggestions and making changes we’ve asked for. That’s more than a lot of game companies do.
---
I am taking a break from it, despite having nothing else to play.  I just find it all exhausting.  The down votes, and the toxic responses that the OP is getting for asking a  completely legitimate question, is emblematic of what the player base is devolving into.    I've had some first hand experience in the game that also reflects this.  No need to go into detail because I am not posting to vent my own frustrations. I am here to advise the OP to stay away.
---
Arent medium swing weapons supposed to be slower than unarmed / punching weapons lol?
---
I do agree however they could use a damage increase. Their supposed to be a median between fast lower damage weapons and slow high damage weapons. 
---
However i would never use a non punching weapon. The fast and very fast weapons are too weak. The slow weapons are strong but too slow for groups. Some median weapons are great all around weapons but you wont be 1 shotting anyone really and as a melee player you want to take the least damage as possible. The exception is i think grognak axe or something that heals on kills. Otherwise ill take a power fist or mole miner and 1 or 2 shot everything.
---
How do you know someone is duper?
---
Yeah, but what about all the stuff you don’t want to loot.
---
Yeah, no. That's not how that works. Stop inboxing me until you get some proof huh?
---
Philippi Battlefield Cemetery, they are usually high teens, low 20s.
---
Bash to death with the syringer.
---
Agreed, as a PvE enthusiast, I like players to be as well equipped as possible! The more available such a weapon becomes, the more reasonable the pricing will get!
---
Spray and pray bro
---
Yeah. Stay at your camp/shop while others are stopping by. Ask them to trade and see what they’ve got. Or get on the mic and just ask them directly if they’ve got what you’re looking for, maybe in storage if they’re not carrying the stuff.
---
Shit, I sold mine for 45 and someone bought it instantly.
---
I'm not sure if I'm experiencing the bug or just suck at melee, more testing is required
---
Then you’ll be bitxhing that people have said better gun. You’re talking your self in circles. first the duper’s. And that your gear is worse than vendors. Then you can buy any gun. Everyone has the same gun. And now getting angry. This is a stupid post considering you haven’t even played the game In however long. 
---
What kind of weapons do you have? I use melee, I’ve got some heavy weapons, handmades, etc. I just think you have no idea what you’re even complaining about.
---
Short delay but I’m sure it’ll be worth it, really looking forward to them.
---
I'm glad to hear it's not only me then. Hopefully something comes of it.
---
Which platform? I have something for you. :-)
---
You're the one that keeps in boxing me. Don't want called out don't inbox me.
---
People already offered video of catching it, so the burden of proof relies on you. If it is so easy to prove or disprove like you claim then you could easily do it.
---
Same got a link saved just in case this question pops out.
---
Yes. I happened to fast travel inside locked camps a few times and I felt bad for trespassing. Of course I left a paper bag with spoiled meat and toilet paper on their beds but still...
---
Ah crap thank you anyway
---
Depends on why though - for rose sure....but for the hunter challenge for a tadpole badge not so much.
---
Caught many people duping and the way its done a 3rd party can see it when its being done but as last I checked I can't tell you how its done in this reddit forum. Also another way to tell if they have 3 entire sets of the exact same rolls for BOS sets.
---
Mole rats hate my campfire so much.
---
I’m cheap/broke in game so I server hopped till I got the plans.
---
Never knew this wtf
---
Every. Single. Time.
---
No mic either. I was going to get the crap kicked out of me by the mirelurk queen.
---
I have parasites all time, so it sometimes go to negative zone of thirst and hunger bar. :D
---
And no proof. Hmmm.
---
Same here. Drains way faster than hunger.
---
I don't advise getting one.  I was extremely pissed when I found out that you need flux to repair it and I just ended up scrapping it.
---
Nah they been like that since release. Until the sheepsquatch they were the single most dangerous threat in all of WV. Since you can find them in groups of 2-5 I think they are probably still the most dangerous thing in all of WV. Deathclaws sadly are nothing even for melee. If you don't think so, when in Melee just keep stepping behind them (deathclaws)they can't hit you lol. Basic MMO strat there with large front attack mobs, nestle up to the testicles.
---
For some reason my crossbow legit won't degrade... I need to repair 3 of them but I can't get the condition to drop, I took off gunsmith and ran around killing shit for hours and it didn't drop a sliver lol.
---
We can do that lol. I was just going to jump to my death
---
How much??
---
each challenge gives 1 point they upgrade you soon as you get tadpole level you get 1 free point for getting to possum but man is it a lot of work for possum lvl I knocked out backpacks in 1 day (athlete / archery / swimming) ok a long day.... but have yet to finish 1 of the possum badges and I need 8...... for the high capacity bag
---
Make him one of the cloaking assaultrons.
---
If you want to know mechanically.
---
The easiest way to get a stun sound from a player character is with a 0 damage hit with a high hitstun. This makes your character grunt depending on the type of damage for the hit, same rules as attacks that do damage.
---
The sound lists for different classes of reactions.
---
In this case to get the electrical damage stun reaction sound the decontamination shower hits you with a 0 damage electrical attack. Electric attacks come with special vfx, and when your whole goal is to save time and resources it's not really worth doing extra work and special code to hide those minor vfx. Hence you get electrical shock sound and visual.
---
God damn casual lol
---
Exams are just one part of the badges, you can see their other requirements under world challenges
---
I understand completely where you are coming from. I just want one because I get a lot of radiation and it just looks cool as well
---
That's a different quest
---
I do agree it feels like a broken mechanic to be able to do that. Although, it doesn’t seem like you were in the middle of combat. If you had time to do it without being killed while looking at the map, it seems like you may have been hidden well enough to have earned a reprieve. The only person you really cheated was yourself, IMO. There’s something exhilarating about escaping alive from a fight you know you can’t win.
---
Well I hope the killings went well lol.
---
A month later you saved me. I walked past the note on the door 4-5 times. Thanks!
---
I saw a few camps today selling adhesive for 23 each and so on. 
---
That made me Think if People buy at those prices. So I wanted to hear u guys
---
Haha yup! Playing since beta and only lvl 43 and proud!
---
And thanks for sharing!
---
Could always go with 7175
---
Lol, so how could one provide proof of the water going down quicker?
---
Who would have had the foresight to time their water consumption prior to patch, and taken a screen shot or movie, then do the same post patch?
---
I am glad i am not keeping top tier things. Would want be banned because of witchhunting :D
---
Happened to me today - had to pick the lev 3 lock to get out. PS thanks for the acid!
---
So much logic here from Beth
---
Still need a pal? I think we can do it at my camp, maybe...
---
I did silo Charlie this morning on Xbox and found one in a random toolbox in the silo
---
Good God if you think I'm talking in circles you've never seen a straight line.
---
Weird. On PS4 I feel the stability/loading is the fastest it has ever been
---
U looking for any other items?
---
how am i profiting off of this?
---
It can actually yield all the items ye need. Radroaches, bloatflies and stingwings spawn during the last part of it.
---
I've had 10 in my machine for 50 caps since the patch and have had no luck yet.
---
Thanks for sharing. 
---
If u don’t mind me asking. 
---
How’s your customer flow on the junk?
---
Maybe try bashing. I was helping my friend get started and I tried to save durability on his pistol by pistol whipping. It broke pretty fast.
---
For what it's worth, they completely eliminated slap damage in adventure mode a couple patches ago.
---
Too be fair. I’m probably going to still send off my old legendary items to new players. Not beats the blessing of charity stat boost irl.
---
Word man. first day of player vending I made 10K caps on ammo alone. I even sold shotgun shells at 2 caps a pop. I still routinely sell ammo. 5MM and shotgun shells seem most popular to me, but that could maybe just be coincidence. 
---
If you have a good quantity (1,000+) players are keen to clean you out and restock
---
A question on the Serums: They sell to a vendor for around 480c, wouldn't you want to price them somewhere around that for a benefit/benefit scenario?
---
Just make it, store it and only bring it out when you need to
---
If the camp owner is there when it happens, go nuts with the emotes so they can realize the error. Or use the mic if you've got it.
---
For some reason camp owners spawn in different locations than visitors. They won't realize it unless somebody points it out.
---
Adding, vub580! Thx!
---
I had a protectron called mr insult or something tell me i wasn't worth killing. I'm loving the random encounters
---
Real AF title hahaha
---
You shouldn't *need* to, annoyingly Imgur is just bad at displaying the actual image to mobile users. Again, see if you can "request desktop site" from within the app
---
You die first. Sorry about that.
---
except it doesn't. at least for me. 
---
someone buys my 25 stimpacks? and yes, they did buy them all, instead of getting the 5-600 caps like I should have, I instead got 225. a third of what I should have gotten.
---
I had over 7000 fusion cells for sale. someone just happened to buy some, it popped up that they purchased over 7000 cells, and all of a sudden there's no more fusion cells in my shop, and I've only received around 2000 caps?
---
nah. it's not working. period.
---
It works for as long as you have friends in different servers, then you have to start going through the menu!
---
Dude! Lol. Wanna help a brotha out?
---
Who ever offers more
---
If anyone else would like to do this, I also need to get this done on PS4.
---
PSN digi_dg
---
One usually spawns at the NAR Repair Yard, on the desk in the tower. Might have to server hop a few times, but it 100% spawns there as I've had three from there today!
---
Wait really? Thats amazing I had no idea! Im definitely going back to adventure lmao, I missed way more than I thought on my break from the game lol
---
It happens so often that now as soon as I spawn in I immediately start running so that I can escape in case the house loads onto me.
---
Thirst doesn’t seem any quicker. I’d say food spoils slower than before the patch however.
---
They were? I haven't seen anything about it. I even suggested it not long ago and people hated the idea for some reason. Seems like a really smart idea for Bethesda to do in my opinion.
---
I keep seeing this on reddit and then I go online and literally no one is selling anything good
---
Thanks for um....sharing?
---
The meat pile or dead body go back to the mobs spawn point a lot of times. Sometimes depending on where I am I can find them, other times not.
---
Happened to me too
---
wtf haha i have 1000hs and i have never seen that one, i fucking love it
---
I was gonna do that but I'm a poor boy in 76 right now. What's the lvl on that tho?
---
Yeah I’ve made a ton of caps and ammo letting other people use it and give it back
---
It seems to be bugged. Happened to me while trying to move it. Had to unselect and reselect a couple times then it worked. You'll probably need to do the same. Maybe even exit building mode and try again?
---
i place my cardboard cut out at the very edge of my camp circle, some melee enemies will target it first. some gun enemies though will still shoot turrets when they begin to fire back
---
Just play the game solo. It's not mandatory to play with others, I only play solo and it's not that bad lol.
---
The Reboot protagonists goal was to to defeat the user. That was their thing. They were the enemy NPCs.
---
Lucky for you :D
---
I agree we should be able to bulk ammo... I disagree ammo is not worth 1 cap. No ammo from any vendor in the game is less than a cap, some are 3,4 or 5 caps even. crafting ammo still takes time. Sure steel and lead and gunpowder are abundant, but at the quantity of ammo some people go through (particularly heavy gunners) it can be a time sink. Some people just don't want to bother, or don't want to run the perks. 
---
Bulking ammo will just let you be more competitive with cost and offer up deals to get people to buy. Things that create a competitive economy and marketplace are good for the game.
---
Can add me to this mist guys - will be on for the next couple of hours.
---
I'm a little further south than most people use so haven't had too much trouble there. I only get the spot taken message maybe once a week at most.
---
Every hear of anesthetic? This is for procedures that cause the users to yell out in pain.
---
I’d be okay with just the skin texture
---
My game is glitching, it’s not letting me access my pop boy or anything
---
I thought about trying that but got bored and hopped on another game last night. Maybe I will give it a shot tonight.
---
No idea. I have stimpaks and Rad away for you though.
---
It is used for creating some meds. Psycho, namely
---
I found a bunch of cameras last time I went through the silo to launch a nuke
---
System? I would love the lead and steel :)
---
What I do is trigger the “search” then bounce around the room/area checking other things. Like if there are two med kits then I trigger one, go to the other, trigger that one then go back to the first. 
---
It helps...
---
also lately as a melee char I've been wondering how the f I'm supposed to fight scorchbeasts now that even my backup explosive harpoon gun is useless
---
Weird, it seems the drop rate went down then. Mine. Has been about one in every 4 or 5. I hope you get your badges soon, Possum.
---
I like the fact that enemies spawn when players arrive, it makes the game more genuine, people together defending the camp, i like it :D
---
&gt;Works every time
---
Sounds like a plan then, I'd better start posting, can't wait for the profit :)
---
Ok, but I said round and not ammo to specifically refer to ballistic ammo. Obvs fusion cores are worth more than 1 cap, but still 'worth' and 'value' are subjective and subjectively speaking all ballistic ammo is worth less than one cap to me.
---
Yeah, this stuff needs to get fixed. Also on PC, there are a lot of times you place something then the next item won't respond at all until you back out and back into build menu (nothing selected). Sometimes you cant connect a wire to the last power item you placed and you have to back out and back in etc. all kinds of crazy annoying little bugs have come in with each patch.
---
To avoid having to destroy, set up player vendor machines.
---
***"***[*Put your shirt back on!*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itOD0MW3vHs)***"*** lol
---
Joking aside... The issue in my case wasn't related to Legendary effects (I may not have made that clear, sorry). It's just Underarmor (like the Vault 76 Jumpsuit we have by default), but with a Modification. 
---
However, in all fairness, Legendary effects basically ***are*** just Mods as far as the game's concerned, so I guess that same mechanic would be the issue in both of our instances.
---
dupers
---
They ended up redesigning Morgantown Airport, presumably because the original design was a needlessly complex, claustrophobic mess despite being a low-level area.  Anyone who has been there surely remembers how you'd get zinged from a dozen different directions, and the excessive number of doors that accidentally take your back outside.
---
That was tedious! Thanks for the invite.
---
Idk family that was the only way I could deal damage before, with all the rifle perks on my gauss it woukd still take &lt; 5 shots to kill a level 40 mole man. Something isn't fun about spending 100 shots to kill 10 enemies half my level to get enough lead to make 50 shots...
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Unfortunatelly, still not working.
---
I was doing that for a while, but saw the range at other vendors went from 200 to 1000 per serum. 
---
I sell 3 a day at the train station to  help hit the 1400 daily cap limit.  Then adjust my prices based on how many I have left in stock. 
---
Farming materials is a pain sometimes. My prices are higher today because I’m running a little low on inventory.
---
Right?! The silo wiped me out of ammo otherwise I would have been more help, sorry
---
No, it doesn't, that's not how it works but someone else is already indulging your despicable laziness and lack of integrity. So no worries. Proof incoming. People like you are why social media was a mistake. Keep forwarding those chain letters for good luck, grandma.
---
Yup. Pacifist players and all camps are immune to player damage now. The only way to PvP in adventure is to contest someone's workshop, and even then the owner has to come back to initiate it. If they don't return within a minute or so they just lose the claim and can't be killed. It's frigging awesome.
---
The PA Station is sorta bugged, try placing it at your feet on a foundation (or somewhere that allows it to be place) then move it to where you want it to be.
---
That needs a lot of time and dedication, pricing etc. OP doesn't have the time.
---
The crossbow? I think the lowest level you can craft is 15.
---
stopped launching nukes becouse of this. Whats the point in doing the silo when you cant even Fast travel fast enough so you can tag at least something.. those guys just sprint and oneshot everything.
---
You can just store it when it's nearly broken and when you place it back it'll be at 100% condition.
---
I placed mine indoors and it never gets damaged.
---
We have 2 world bosses right now. Sheepsquatch imposter and Scorchbeast queen. Heart of the swamp arguably.
---
I think at least some of the overpricing is through naivety . I've fallen prey to this as well, I didn't trade anything prior to the vendor release. Somethings I'm guessing I underprice because they get bought up quickly. Others I guess I overpriced because they don't sell, so I incrementally lower it.
---
3k is a lot for a serum considering the materials required to make it aren't so rare you never find them.
---
I just tried it out myself, it's true. Neither the repaired ones nor the broken cameras can go anywhere but into my stash. All they are good for then is as spares if I accidentally scrap my main camera, and to be equipped with different lenses (how many are there, btw, I have got two, and then there is the NV lens as a Possum reward?).
---
Only way for the OP then is to keep on looking into world containers (a few of the small red toolboxes around Whitesprings often seem to contain them for me). We on PS4 could try alerting them to a container when we find one, but there is no guarantee it will be in there for them as well, thanks to instantiated loot. :-/
---
Not much. Actually I am actively using these junk. So that's why prices are high. If somebody buy one of it, well sweet sweet caps, but if there are no customers for these, I am still good about it.
---
Only way to avoid destroying at that weight.
---
I try to help. Gonna be doing a write up of the scout missions soon.
---
Wow I guess they trying to keep the code the same, that's nuts, but I guess they also want the vendor stuff to work in survival .. although if people have turrets, I guess they not intending to sell anything other than to try get useless kills sounds like.
---
Thats awesome! One of my first workshop experiences was claiming and unclaimed one and someone with explosive bullets coming over and one shotting me lol. Im glad that camps are immune to damage from players as well, because someone broke my walls and turrets last time I played! Thanks for the info!
---
This and hunger have been claimed to be faster literally every fucking patch. If nobody in the history of the game has this down, sure, maybe that would be hard. I'm tired of answering this exact question. So proof? Put up or shut up.
---
That was needed in 4 because you couldn’t build just anywhere. Now you can plop your Barbie dream house wherever you want.
---
where  am i hating on bethesda? 
---
yeah, i'm annoyed that their vending system is apparently broken for me, just like you'd find posts of me annoyed with dupers and bugs and whatnot when the game came out, and the godawful way to get that damn camera, but I otherwise love the game. you could go through my post history if you wanted, you'd find no instance of me actually hating on the game.
---
as for my gamertag, it's literally in the video, both actually in the clip, and the description. also nothing on that channel is monetized or with ads, in case you care about that.
---
I've tried that 10+ times, and we did it ONCE when I got lucky with 4 other players in it too. I think that version of the quest is the one where you get a badge so they've made it very difficult.
---
&gt;scam and fix
---
I sorry but that was hilarious :)
---
You need to go into modify camera and then craft the lens, not intuitive .. also make sure you read the plan
---
Have you seen the materials required for Ultracite ammo? Its worth more than 1 cap.
---
Upvoting for exposure. Duping kills online games, and this isn't just happening on ps4 it's happening on PC as well.
---
https://youtu.be/s62msrPjSVY
---
must be my nonexistent 76 clickbait youtube channel. thats where the profit is.
---
So when you have the exact same 3 star item 3 times times for same armor piece multiplied by 5 different types of armor either your super god like lucky or you duped it. Also you put it in special location to dupe it where legendaries don't spawn and caught many people putting their items there.
---
I don't know what you mean but these junk are my only one character's farms. Which is I have only one character.
---
I found a couple last time I went through the silo to launch a nuke
---
That sweet, sweet useless karma. Hint: you're not, you're just wrong.
---
Yeah but not everyone knows that lol the AAE ones seem to sell best believe it or not.
---
Yes. This isn’t Rust. Think of it more like ESO or WoW. No one wants to do all the quest lines over each time a new update comes out. A persistent character for each update is the point. Each update is pointed towards the people who have finished the main quest line
---
&gt;Leave a sign with a message telling others what you're looking for by your vending machines with instructions to add you to a team if they want to sell you it
---
That's exactly what I do. I have a sign on my wall saying "buying stable flux 50 caps each. Msg me if not home." when I'm stocked up I just hang a painting on the wall to cover the letters.
---
I never thought of vendoring to hit the cap. Great idea!
---
If this was me I would nuke windows and start from scratch, new OS install with nothing else installed then new FO76 install and see what happens. Good luck.
---
no it was not.
---
none of my transactions last night was done correctly.
---
Are you okay? You seem very angry.
---
lmao what
---
Nice post, if you are PS4..swing by my shop at whitesprings station and I'll hook you up with a sweet deal, naturally heavily discounted.
---
Psn is pirateglenn1..what's yours?
---
I have 900 hours in game. I'm rolling my eyes at you trying to defend "assassins sentinels isn't that rare".
---
It's at the tinkers workbench not the weapon bench, which is also counter intuitive since it counts as a weapon
---
i keep saying these people need to be banned. the dupers and the buyers. instead of banning accounts ban their credit or payment method eventually they will run out of those options.
---
Will any broken ProSnap Camera do? Or do you need one off the tourist to fix? I know to start the Bucket List quest you need the tourists', but I just want the camera for the Tadpole challenges
---
I agree, and at the end of the day it is only pixels, just forget it all and delete the character.
---
Reading "The Witcher" novels bud? Your linguistics are dead on. 😘
---
You can get 15 from my vending machine at my camp.  :)
---
I'm pretty sure the ones I picked up let me craft the camera
---
Says every player ever. Unfortunately, this is not gonna happen. I switch to my weakest weapon in situations like that just for tag credit. Most other people aren't gonna even care if you get credit or not though. That's never going to change in any game. I have seen the Scorchqeen go down faster than I could map from the silo and load. Got no credit, just event ended as I load in.
---
Try to search in toolboxes. I've found some inside those
---
The only proof i've got is my own personal experience.
---
I previously didn't have to drink this much to keep the thirst bar up.
---
Yeah, I'm okay! Thank you, I get that vibe too. Just hate lies and misinformation, not nice people who ask stuff like that. :)
---
No. They didn't wipe when the TSE were duped like crazy. They will not wipe but they will nerf everything.
---
I get the same feeling  when buying recipes for mutations, plans and stuff so i can make caps and people just doing it for free.
---
Same feeling when months ago i grinded the same event over and over again,  just so now people that didn't even have accounts back then to get that mask for free.
---
Nothing is worth in the game, get used to that idea. Stick to PvE and you won't care what weapons people will be using. On the contrary, you will pray for some good stuff when fighting the queen.
---
   Also, looking at how people cry if you sell anything more than 5K.
---
Hm. Doing any silo runs soon?
---
I think you're right.  I don't notice it because I have Healing Factor and regenerate way faster than they can tear me down.
---
Raider vendors tend to have them these days.
---
I really hope it is fixed ASAP. Player vending completely changed game-play in a fun way and this fix would increase the fun even more
---
I just wanted them gone. That freed up about 20 stash space.
---
That's not proof. That's an anecdote.
---
you can either server hop for years, or just buy the plans
---
Ah yeah i see. 
---
Not bad idea
---
WS resort has a few toolboxes, and the cameras have spawned in trashcans as well as on ghouls lately. The firehouse behind the parking lot has a few, as well as the laundry building between the resort and the golf club
---
I'm not out to spread lies and misinformation. I got enough of that crap from the clickbait youtubers.
---
I genuinely believe thirst is decreasing faster.
---
PC here have never had this issue, yet. Karma says normally when I read a thread like this I start getting the issue lol.
---
I'd happily go with you but I'm on xbox
---
Is there a trick to making this weapon good? XD
---
Whenever I play, a large amount of people's camps are scattered around the Whitesprings. Everyone treats it like a hub already.
---
Ah ok, didn’t realize that there’s a new reason to do that.
---
It's the thought that counts
---
That won't help, I'm afraid. Once you've done the quest, the tourists won't give you another broken camera. I've come across a few Annes and Ansels, and all they had was generic loot. :-(
---
I am finding a lot of them in small red toolboxes and on WS ghouls, but the latter ones might mostly be the &lt;junk&gt; version (not Deluxe).
---
hollow points. always.
---
Have some decency? You mean I shouldn’t be able to “make” and “sell” 24000 stimpaks?  People complain about weapon duping but shit it’s everywhere.  Armor, ammo, weapons, aids, chems, you name it.
---
All 1*?
---
Yeah tbf ultracite may be the only exception. I tend to forget about it because it's so expensive.
---
Good luck I hope you can find one
---
Oh I see why you replied that and remember your name when you posted that post about using exploit to get the backpack mods with paying.
---
I had to craft a level 15 to get it to degrade enough to do the repairs
---
Seems like I don't have a choice then
---
? O.o
---
They need to do like GW2 here set a daily, weekly and monthly cap, everything else goes into the system and is mailed (in this case appears)to you when the time cap has expired.
---
Firestorm also requires paying a monthly subscription to play, so fuck if I know why you think that's a good comparison to a possible free mode
---
WS resort and the golf club, search the toolboxes and trashcans. Also the ghouls seem to drop them as loot lately. I found two in the laundry building between the club and resort, and one in the firehouse with all the crafting benches
---
Just here to say - same.
---
Good to know it was tested as always, by us. The QA team.
---
You literally own the game. just turn it on and see for yourself. Jesus. You want other players to paint you a picture of what has happened to woo you back?
---
Good lord, this is the most lazy, self entitled post I have ever seen. You want a time line of 9 patches and 6 months of game time? God, every set of patch notes are right here on this site for you to go read.
---
Keeping an eye out for a Bloodied explosive one myself, so it'll be useful against the the creatures of the world.
---
I noticed today that the MODUS vendor terminals are limited to 1 active terminal of each type again. (Vendor is busy...)
---
I think it's related.
---
I found a lower level player and just messaged them asking if they wanted to team.  I made sure they understood what my mission was and that I would use my meds to heal them and give them extra stuff.
---
Hell, at this point *I* call it treasure. Can never have enough of the stuff.
---
So before you read it you can mod your backpack?
---
While I agree, Also people have bought multiple thousands of round off of me at 1 cap each. So I am not complaining.
---
Those have been hard to find of late.
---
Freestates vendor sells the plans if they’ve already been snagged in the wild.
---
What a terrible idea.
---
Well, that's fine and all, but you're still doing it. It's not faster. It's been claimed every patch so I would hope at this point someone would have some footage, no? Yet...
---
I have one, it's very good. I've had it for a few weeks now. It used to be valuable 😂
---
No I’m not talking about content wise I was more looking for the community-wise changes within the past 6 months/ opinions about the optimization and all that
---
Sry if I offended you
---
&gt;I'm tired of answering this exact question.
---
You are not forced to answer Reddit questions or even to visit this sub, it's all a personal choice. If you are tired of it then stop... simple.
---
I really thought I needed to find the tourist. I always found the broken camera in the golf club in the lockers downstairs... I've scrapped plenty...
---
I have to drink twice as much as I eat but in all honesty it has been like this for me since I can remember.
---
I have not noticed it being any quicker or slower and I have assumed is like this by design?
---
You have to look at the fire and add kindling, A on Xbox, it dies faster in later waves so make sure you grab extra wood earlier,
---
o.O ? xD xD xD!!!!11!11
---
This is my experience
---
Hopefully that'll make them more affordable for me.
---
That’s good to hear
---
&gt;Shoot I just scrap most my one stars that I don’t want myself as I figure no one will buy them and I want the scrip.
---
If they fit a current meta I'll throw my one stars in the vendimg machine for 100-200 caps, and if no one buys them they get scrapped after a couple days. I've sold tons of one star assassin armor pieces for 100 caps each. I'm not sure if people are using them or just buying them to convert to scrip, but I don't really care because either way I got 100 caps for something that literally dropped at my feet.
---
Left arm is 2* but everything else is 3*
---
You're right! I'm out! ✌
---
Hop event to event nonstop for a few days, Sell all of your Chems. That's the laziest, easiest way.
---
I've never noticed it until this patch.
---
Each silo has a 3 hour cool down. So as long as the individual silo has a nuke at the ready, yea. I've been on maps with simultaneous nuke launches resulting in plenty of crashed servers at launch. Much more steady now
---
Definitely, I've seen 3 nukes hitting Fissure prime and Whitespring within a few minutes of each other so they must have been from different silos.
---
I second the laundry. The red toolbox in the room with the armor bench almost always has one for me...or the large toolbox in the same room...basically that room.
---
Bombs fell and the world as you know it is over. There's radiations everywhere and super mutants.
---
The tourist themselves spawns at the fast travel point for the Resort, on the top of that red car in front of the valet overhang. It took me two weeks and I gave up, one fast travel later and there he was. If youre looking for him, best bet is to go to the resort, if you can't find him do a WS run for the sweet loot, and find a different server. Rinse and repeat, hopefully it doesn't take you too long
---
Now turn it into a Colonel Gutsy, and I'd give it anything it wanted.
---
i got badges off of Nia ending before.  if i get that ending i just run through it solo
---
the service entrance, THANK YOU you legend, I've been looking forever.
---
i am gonna make a disclosure here. i just let the price of the item as default by the vendor machine.  its to early to know the real effective price of anything. side note if i am on your sever i sell a lot of junk if your ever in need.
---
Don't keep weapons/armor that don't fit your build. Convert weapons and junk to ammo, it weighs less. Sell surplus aid for caps. Drop ammo that you will never likely use. Sell gold &amp; silver, it's easy to find if you need it. Don't hoard fusion cores, they are everywhere. Don't need every/multiple sets of PA, excavator is good for mining bonus, plus one other set.
---
"Our"? What are you, commie scum?
---
You are wrong about words - they are abstract - people create the definitions through use and meanings change over time.  They don’t spring into existence as though created by gods - all words are made up.
---
True - but honestly that would have been loads more work. Hopefully this will suffice since you can approximate the safe-zone anyway.
---
""*within an hour""
---
Wait, is it possible to fast-travel to a friend's camp and NOT get stuck in the floor? 🤔
---
Added bonus; that room spawns a box of loose screws and gears next to the workbench, and three of four abraxo in the laundry room.
---
Its a mod i believe. Enter the crafting table with the mod option after youve crafted a backpack
---
It’s beautiful!
---
Its only skins and paints from the atomic shop
---
Not the acuall items
---
I'm on the Xbox platform I have jetpack plans for the T-45 and the T-51. I'm asking 2,000 caps for each one or both or 3,000.
---
You can also ring the triangle at one of the farms, and a bell somewhere.
---
No absolutely not ...
---
Awesome thanks. Found it now. Far from obvious.
---
To be fair - I took my prior maps of Flora across the world, and just added a few lines of code to convert the appropriate plants into their flux colors. I wasn't going to go all out on this.
---
Hookedonphonics.Com
---
I’ll be on in about an hour. Hope we can help each other. Ign stinkyglen
---
Oh shit... that explains it. I guess I also need the plans for the super sledge and the combat armor... Dang
---
Found a low level wandering around Whitesprings, followed until some super muties downed them and rushed to the rescue.
---
Hang him/her out with proof with a post instead.
---
No problem, happy adventuring!
---
I'm on PC unfortunately, thanks for the offer tho.
---
Yeah, idk if there is a specific limit to how many you can take at a time or if you do it too fast, but its happened a few times while I was trying to fill up on rads
---
But why would someone lie about something like this, what would be the point?
---
For the love of Pete, why do people keep repeating the ‘bulk all’ myth?  If you want to stay organized, fine, but it doesn’t save space
---
Thank you so much for this! I am close to dropping my first nuke, but can’t figure out how to get down into the silo to launch it!(PS4)
---
You're welcome.
---
Have you completed the tadpole scout stuff and earned the backpack? You do need it. The atom shop item is just a skin for the backpack, but you need to unlock the in game backpack first. Don’t get your bank involved, just get those badges!
---
It’s not just technical solutions, no it’s not easy especially for FO series which has always been single player only. But all those dupers are not just selling duped items for caps, they are after real world money. How hard is it for Bethesda to make some purchases of those items to find out the sellers and ban them? Apparently even this is too much work for Bethesda. All they did was running a script to single out accounts with huge amount of identical items. In the process they screwed up the system’s ability to identify legendary items properly, so when you pick up a junkie’s rolling pin, your collection of all rolling pins will do a slide show.

"Psychological projection is a defence mechanism in which the human ego defends itself against unconscious impulses or qualities by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. For example, a person who is habitually rude may constantly accuse other people of being rude."
---
I have text, but cant prove he just walked after taking my gun
---
Atill waitin on the BoS anti air cannons!
---
Get a free vanilla supersledge off a super mutant at west tek, queen drops guarenteed 2 star combat armour. But better yet hit the market subs and buy some for caps. 1 stars are insanely cheap
---
PVP in this game is huge joke, I don’t know why I even try to play survival its either a melee one shot build with speed demon and marsupial or some cuck in full assassins with a TSE and now theres TSE lasers....
---
Well, since according to you the majority of people quit then there's nobody left to answer.
---
   I'm here for the nukashine
---
So, basically it was another classic quick'n'cheap from our dudes at BGS?
---
Yep in vendor on one character ... insyg6ating hunting rifle 500
---
^ this is the real answer. Although I think you’d need 3 ps4s ;)
---
So sick of these ppl. Ruins the game!
---
Server I was on last night, Camp Adams got nuked.
---
Then print the text and post it
---
Ah ok, I must just be really unlucky with her lol, good to know though!
---
Thanks.
---
But since i play alone and the team tab is empty, i discovered that there's no need to even change tab: just press Up on Dpad then A on Xb1 or X on PS4 to get the leave world option.
---
Aha! You've been guided through the launch process by MODUS, yes?
---
Full unyielding + backpack + radicool. What you're  saying is naw man, I'm gonna bike that 7 miles to work, only chumps ride in cars.
---
Not for you.
---
ESAD
---
"TEMPORARILY" aka  Soon™
---
They've been selling for not much more than 10k all day.... I had to trade an arm and a leg to get mine 😂 nevermind
---
My bad. Didn’t know. Just seemed like it did to me.
---
ive only get about 1 from about 20 runs, so maybe bug gives a higher rate?  or im super unlucky as well
---
Overseers camp. There's an overseer chest and a tool box lots of people use to drop care packages. Also Flatwoods, alot of containers in the church
---
This is why I love the player vending they added in. *I've got just what you need, assuming you need the random junk I've got!*
---
I mean, the garden is the only thing it makes sense for the monsters to attack.
---
Could be, whichever it is, it’s a real grind!
---
There's always been TSE lasers.... They just used to be rare. That's why they were the primary target for duping as soon as a new method was found.
---
My honest opinion is if you’re thinking about it, just do it instead of asking strangers. 
---
My fully honest opinion is that there is a big influx of new/returning players who never learned how to use a search function to read replies on the thousands of other similar recent posts :)
---
Dont trust people out there... didnt your overseeker teach you anything.. its dangerous out in the wasteland
---
Absolutely not.
---
And I can't place my fence back.
---
Yeah, I need my assaultron harem.
---
Build them at workshops!! It would be worth claiming several workshops map wide for interlocking fields of fire.
---
The range needs to be improved. It’s always fun to have your camp near white springs and launch into the parking lots at random.
---
Oh god, now I'm imagining Space Oddity played on a tuba.
---
Yes and they're made with a definition lmao
---
If you look up the common definition you can't just say "oh well I disagree with that so that's not what it means."
---
You're just arguing that you can use any word you want and it be right as long as you think it is. Language was made a specific way, with words have meanings whether you like it not. You just sound stupid.
---
I'm with you... I'm tired of the lvl challenge and the photo challenges... they arnt challenges... THEY ARE CHOIRS
---
This needs to happen.
---
So you loved all fallout games but never really tried 76? Just "heard" that it's bad and all?
---
   Then i recommend you some anthem or apex legends, whatever.
---
Hi,
---
Since you started the original thread, i've been wanting to say a big thank for thoses precious maps, but also can i suggest adding military grade duct tape on the balistic fiber map?
---
Thanks a bundle.
---
My only guess is some people struggle to have enough acid to smelt everything involved in making ammo. 
---
That was me on my first character.
---
Then I made a camp on an acid deposit and everything was OK.
---
That happened to me 2 days ago. I exchanged something yesterday, checked and the total was back, correct.
---
Any chance you can provide a map with a grid of the game's XY coordinates?
---
Because its easier to cheat, if I didn't buy from a duper I would never get my BOS sent unyielding set because of the odds are trash on getting rolls you want.
---
There is armor with poison resist so if that is the only thing that can hurt you might be worth stacking up on it.
---
It's driven me to move and redo my camp three or four times since release. If I can get my hands on the brick or metal building set and some of the neon signs it'll really look like a questionable medical practice!
---
Hey I have the plams for the regular nuke grenade or the quantum grenade what platform do you play on?
---
I wish I could build like that, I just made a wooden box for fast travel and crafting.
---
Maybe!? I have killed all the “blinking” zombies for  codes to alpha, and got the launch card. Next part is go to the silo but I go to the portable bathrooms, press the button, but nothing happens... I am close to lvl 40 but have power armor and still kinda weak but can hold my own. Generally play by myself and killed a lvl 50 scorchbeast by myself at 35.
---
Yea I know Unyielding doesnt boost endurance that wasnt new. Like you said its stated in the tooltip so no didnt miss that.
---
Whats new is the underarmor endurance and the added +1 endurance on each unyielding armor piece. 
---
It gives me lower ap drain while sprinting that is one of the reasons im running high endurance. (also so all my stats are high exept everything but endurance) and it seems as although the endurance is there you see it in the pip boy and get the action point drain reduction but weirdly not the extra hp the endurance should provide. 
---
I get that its maybe capped at a certain high but noticed the same with endurance from food, drinks and chems. You get the endurance points and the running benefits but not the Hp.(Exept Psychobuff!Seems to work)
---
Will investigate further.
---
I agree.... But once you have everything you're looking for, what keeps you playing?
---
Try Miner Monument and inside Uncanny Caverns.
---
Hate to say this, but if they're over the cap, I don't think they can drop it any more. Only destroy it. Not sure if you can trade it away or sell it, but I imagine if you die, at least the junk will be left in a pile
---
Summary? Sure.
---
Go for anthem or apex legends. There's no veterans left playing, we're here for the nukashine
---
You’re the one lying.
---
Yes I know they’ve been around but now there just as wide spread as regular duped TSE
---
As someone that owned a (fairly popular) Minecraft server for 4 years... my gut reaction to this is: NO! lol
---
This will not go well. I love the idea and how practical it could be, but I think there are *just* enough immature people playing 76 that it'll be a problem.
---
However, I will admit that the 76 community on the whole is quite awesome and it *may* not be as bad as I'm envisioning... Yet on the same token, we do have an issue with duping. If they consider that acceptable, then I can imagine a sign reading "TELL UR MOM THNX 4 LETING US BONE HER!" isn't a huge leap. 
---
There's the "Small Letter Signs" plan that is rather sufficient for this IMO.  
---
All you have to do is place it backwards --mind you I've not tested on the back-- and place the letters against the pure-white sign. It's big enough to fit quite a few words on it, just like the signs in Minecraft. I think the tedious nature of making them would actually prohibit people's desire to troll given it'd take time.
---
There's also the fact that consoles would then need an On Screen Keyboard in order to type in their messages. As a PC player, I continually forget about this element... but then, surely it must be already available in order to type their names of New Character? Either way, if not, a possibly simple alternative would be having A-Z+Punctuation just being scrollable (like the old school High Score lists in arcade/console games). \*shrug\*
---
Tell me about it. I had set up shop on the western cliffside just beneath the Top of The World (there was a somewhat hidden lead deposit), but now I've set up shop just north of the Whitesprings Station and business is muuuuch better. So tempted to use some of my scant Atoms to buy the bulb light letters set.
---
Yep, there's nothing left in this game that's rare anymore.
---
I have one already, but when I go to the crafting table I can’t select the mod or do anything. It just won’t let me.
---
No one should get in trouble for buying duped weapons. Dupers should get banned, and one duping is officially and finally fixed, all they have to do is overhaul the game and rebalance every legendary thus fixing the issues with everyone have broken guns
---
i can Track them on xbox just fine but it doesnt show the "sub-challenges" just Possum: Photographer x/16
---
This is pretty normal.  One run through here keeps me in lead for a week or three.  The acid is the sticking point for a lot of people (or plastic for the shotgun users)
---
I like heavy weapons and carry all of them on me. With the bear arms perk my 50 cal, fat man and Gatling weight less 10 lbs combined. In the stash you’re looking at almost 30 plus.
---
Welcome!! I’ll give a couple random tips: 1) scrap all your junk as soon as possible because it reduces the weight of it.  2) try and plan ahead for how you build your character (with perks) so you can have it set up and thought out.  3) events give you lots of plans and caps and experience. 4) don’t buy weapon plans from vendors unless you reallllly want too, or they are not available anywhere else. 5) when you scrap weapons you get mods for the weapons so when you find the weapon again you can modify it or build it. 6) put items on your scroll wheel, for example I have my 4 weapons I use, then tons of consumables that take up weight but I use them quickly because it’s helpful (so I have my weapons and then stuff like cram and imatation seafood) 6) try to kind of realize where you are at in the map, the far right side is deadlier for lower levels, the middle left area is pretty easy, the bottom right you will most likely die at low levels, and the rest is intermediate depending on what location you’re at.  These are just random examples that helped me out and continue to help me, good luck!!!
---
It's definitely not random. If random would not have so many 3* legendaries dropping drills.
---
Well I'm gonna put my camp on one now that I use it. I usually had plenty of acid and always just sold my excess until now, so I'm just glad I have a use for it now lol
---
Yeah, that's what i love about Pioneer Scout update because it added a lot of little things in the world that makes it worth re-visiting. When i did the challenge i was like "there's no way i will actually hear a choo-choo sound"
---
That’s good to know. Thanks!
---
We should be allowed to track the Pioneer Scout Challenges like a quest so we don't have to open the map to view them. There are so many subcomponents to each of those challenges and it gets annoying opening the map then scrolling through all of the challenges to find what you need to do next.
---

---
Go there for acid.
---
I've been struggling to scavenge enough lead to keep me stocked in 5.56 ammo, thanks for this.
---
Yea its really sad, Ive been play since release and the best gun I ever got was a explosive black powder pistol :/ even with farming the SBQ and 3 star legendaries 60% of the times a wooden armor or just some really shitty gun. I have never ever gotten a TSE legit
---
I carry a PA chassis just in case. I put it out and I can jump into it.
---
I guess I'm one of the lucky ones, I have a max LVL TSE cryolator I pulled not long after level 50 all them months ago.... And I still have it lol
---
Well shoot.  Evidently I posted this wrong.  I'll remove this and try again.
---
Man that sucks, the a lot for sharing
---
My degree is in language, history, and sociology.  You might not agree with me but it doesn’t change the fact that I know what I’m talking about.  Language is constantly in flux - if a word comes to be understood as meaning something other than what it was once understood to mean the definition shifts.
---
I’m not saying that you can say a word means whatever you want - what I’m saying is that a word means what people think it means.  Take the word ‘literally’ - it now means both its original definition and it can also mean figuratively.  That wasn’t the case twenty years ago - but it changed.  I don’t particularly care for the change - but it did change - because people’s understanding of the word changed.
---
This is excellent information! Thanks for sharing!
---
Yes! Not just me, then.
---
True but honestly I'm rather disappointed in this games content, only thing keeping me going is my extreme hoarding of materials, 20 different xbox accounts with 4+ mules on each one holding all the scrap and aid items I run out of room for. Personally would be happy if they remove the cap on scrap so I can just farm all day but even then Im looking for a new game now since I have having to store excess materials on alts, also I'm one of those guys who would store everything they found in fallout 4 to the point my weapons box would crash the game 1 out 5 times I access it.
---
Damnit you just got it stuck in my head
---
I just captured two of the power plants and had 16 full charged cores in an hour, would have done all 3 but someone else had poseidon and didn't want to bother them.
---
Good news: quest with a new cryptid
---
Bad news: it's your mom
---
It's one of the solutions but i think they'll go for the most obvious and easiest : nerf everything. It's not like they haven't done it before.
---
Nah, just ban the dupers like last time. It sorted itself out pretty quickly. This time however, I would say add an IP, or even MAC ban. Make it sting ten times more than a normal ban, so people stop doing it finally.
---
Contractor perk to reduce your flux costs!
---
Nope, no jersey turnpikes
---
They do exist. I found one in a random container as well. Shows it as a junk item.
---
Now that's a nice channel name.
---
If your on ps4 i can help you
---
Oh god I hope not, I still hate the nerf on two shots they did.
---
Wow.... I thought I was a bad hoarder lol
---
Few things to make it easier
---
- Do it solo
---
- Bring multiple weapons
---
- Wear good armor
---
- Have a lot of meds
---
no under the wooden shed with the bench (near the bear). i think inside the suitcase
---
It was worse with the TSE. We'll survive.
---
I’ll give you tree fiddy.
---
Anyplace. One session, push out as far as you can and set camp.
---
Probably same shits that duped before. I agree, bans should include IP's and be perminate bans
---
Lol yeah I just stopped playing survival because of that. To many invincible players still exist.
---
Did AA for energy weapons get fixed? Doesn't it still only cut physical defense in half?
---
Here my man:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bm8k6q/i_made_an_interactive_checklist_for_all_pioneer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
then you better never trade with anyone ever again. the vast majority of good rolls in the market are dupes. you can more often than not find someone selling the exact same gun somewhere else.
---
which is not to say they function any differently than a "real" one.
---
Lag? I get booted to blue screen more then ever and it happens about once an hour. There is no lag leading up to this. You know sometimes you can sense a kick coming - not now. It’s completely random and unexpected.
---
I play this game almost everyday for daily atoms and met many people including dupers, I ignore them but all the ones I know never got banned on console. Maybe different rules on how they can ban people on consoles?
---
Lmao at the title.........i know why but it's still funny as hell
---
I can’t help, but my best tip is to do the silo by yourself but have someone else on the server with you so you can rejoin in the highly likely event that your game crashes after you launch it
---
All of those degrees make this more sad. 
---
The"definition" of griefing you are referring to mostly exists only in this subreddit and is mostly used incorrectly. 
---
By the way, what does griefing mean to you then? Just people who do anything that upsets someone else?
---
Thanks for the advice, I think I do ok with trading and have managed successfully so far.
---
id play 16 tons on a loop
---
Hi Kandzi01.  If the bug still works, I'd love to learn it as well.  I'll gladly pay 4k caps to borrow it.  I'm on PC IGN: cyberhawk1
---
Yes offends not concerns. Right lol
---
The Uncanny Caverns one is just sitting on a tripod as a world spawn.
---
I guess they'll never raise the cap, then.
---
First I need that recipe - dang melee/vats needs fixing before I can finish the event. (It only drops after the campfire/kindling event, right?)
---
Theres no that much perks
---
These people all have problems and just enable each other lol
---
It says you’re not online....
---
Yes we will survive, the game is bigger than the cheat.
---
Okay.. so... Im a bit confused by all this high mathematics. Can someone give an actuall example for.. lets say 274 caps ?
---
I’ll try to be there!
---
What's the desirability? Grounded mutation, fireproof, dense mod.
---
I didn't really mean it that way. it's just that, if you ever traded for something remotely good, chances are it's a dupe.
---
people used to dupe level 5 explosive pipe guns ffs
---
Duping is still a thing I haven't played in months and they still can't get it right lmao
---
I don’t really care much about it - but I would say in this community that is what the word is coming to mean.
---
I agree that it is a divergence - but community changes to definitions are probably the most common form of linguistic shift.  Like professional jargon for example.
---
Except people claim they've been banned picking up dupe bags.
---
We don't need vigilantes. BGS need to stop introducing this problem.
---
Would love camp items to work like in fallout 4 where most items can't be damaged excluding turrets, or at least get some kind of mechanic to stop enemy spawns within range of camp as this would actually make sub stations in the game usable.
---
Actually everything I said is entirely true. 11 year heroin addict who spent 8 years sucking the govt teet.  So where is the straw man?  I can prove any statement I made however I'm not publicly fixing myself
---
I mean that’s fine and all of EVERYONE loses the duped weapons but I beat get my caps back plus some.
---
Doxxing*
---
I'm always appearing offline lol
---
and how do you even know that? I remember people calling marsupials "dupers".
---
That reply to this thread has me mighty confused lol
---
Tank killers armor penetration is worthless for tesla, but stagger chance is ubergold
---
It just sucks when you spend more time than anyone building up collections and the value of everything you've earn is destroyed in seconds.
---
That’s certainly a strong weapon but you literally can’t use it unless you’ve found some hidden wealth of .308 lol. A handmade or a solid Gatling gun is fine. Can’t go wrong with bloodied rn but again anti-armor doesn’t look like it’ll be nerfed or anything so I guess you can go that route (actually strong af anyway) or furious even.
---
Yea never had a game where duping was almost always available and even old ones becoming unpatched, and currently after emergency maintenance recently the duping exploit still works o.o
---
Also gimme dat armor 😡
---
Hm that’s something to think about. Sorta a guaranteed stagger in that clip i suppose right?
---
Yeah, I really like the poison damage mechanics for the most part and wish to see it further expanded upon. I think it's neat that these enemies (bloodbugs, mirelurk queens, etc.) have this unique damage set that if your not prepared for will kill you quickly. What I am not the biggest fan of is the counters to this damage type. It can spawn on legendary armor with 25psn resistance. Or you can use a mag that gives 15+ psn resistance.
---
What's your GT?
---
Absolutely this, ban wave would be great news and might help deter people from cheating in future.
---
Because I was taught the method and I've been robbing them for the last 3 days. There's a specfici area of the map where it's done and it's very easy to steal what they are duping.
---
Certain weapons have - I believe so -hidden stagger chance stat. Tesla has it high. Tank killer tesla has it higher. More like two-three guaranteed staggers in a clip.
---
How noble of you.
---
I’ve got all but the OVN. Can’t get it to spawn.
---
Title of your sex tape
---
I agree, I think it's purely for greed and trades.
---
Ya it really sucks. It would be nice if we could just get a fresh restart server.
---
I haven’t done any of the new content, and never did crossbow so I can’t confirm. You might want to do it somewhere with low level stuff that you need, like mutants for steel scrap and gunpowder.
---
Just happened to me again while i was viewing my stash box. After about a minute my character made the noise of being hit, saw a hit marker too. Immediately exited stash box prepared to fight, nothing was around me. Even fired off some shots in a grid pattern to ensure nothing invisible near me and nothing.
---
I got Tesla and railway plans
---
Yes. Yes it would.
---
Jesus Christ.  Listen, if you don't want people to call you out for bullshitting there's this little thing called EVIDENCE.
---
No one is asking you to show video proof of before and after drains on your thirst but you have to provide SOMETHING more than two sentences of whining.
---
It just too me almost FORTY FIVE MINUTES of constant sprinting with speed demon to go from 100% hydrated to the first stage of dehydration.
---
How much for both?
---
Yep...at this point, I just FT to the nearest location and walk to it...annoying but...eh.
---
 I was locked in someone's house, luckily I was able to jump out of the window on the 3rd floor. It was the brick wall with the large window.
---
A fast travel mat would solve all these issues...y'know like there are for workshops.
---
I am noble and proud of this game. I play it hard and fair and want the feeling of achievement through effort and if that means I die over and over..so be it. Duping weapons should be an account deletion in my honest opinion not a ban.
---
That's just cruel there aren't even any enemy spawns to farm there
---
\*embarrassed emote\*  
---
I've been playing since the beginning of December and only about 2 months ago did I even know we COULD "track" the Challenges...
---
Worse yet, is... &gt;\_&gt;  
---
I've never actually figured out HOW to track them. T\_T 
---
I'm on PC, and I've pressed everything on the keyboard while on the Challenges screen. I've also tried clicking them, all to no avail. The only thing that seems to do anything is W,A,S,D to navigate, and E to expand.  
---
Though, I just now realized I may not have tried Spacebar :S 
---
So if that ends up *still* not being it, and anyone knows how to do it on PC, I'd love to finally know! *(Even if you know how on Console and tell me what action the button pressed typically does, that may at least give me an idea* :P*)*
---
Thank you very much! I actually do use that. I'm really bad about updating it in real-time, though, and part of what I want the tracking for is the numbered items ("How many Liberators have I killed at Charleston Railyard? I have *one left*? Crap.").  
---
Great resource for those who are better about it than I am! (I actually commented on that post apparently, lol)
---
I do like that idea.
---
Lol I'm sorry but why are people playing this if this is how they continue to treat us?! It's like ordering food from a resteraunt again that you just got food poisoned from! Just because you play it doesn't mean they won't still try and screw you over!
---
Where are these dupers? I wanna rob them
---
Yes and I'm arguing that it shouldn't just be turned into a derogatory term for anyone this community dislikes. It strips meaning from the work and just becomes a form of toxicity, and allows others to climb on a high horse against anyone who wrongs them.
---
I play on ps4 and PC. Same issue on both systems. My Wife, and My Brother also have this issue.
---
I have all armor sets in the game. Most of it in my stash. Having such access to items, I only use single assassin piece in my PvP build, and I think a mix is the best possible choice. I'm PvP focused and very efficient in it. If these other pieces are hunters or mutant slayers, not so, but life-saving, chameleon, regenerating, unyielding, vanguard, weightless sentinel pieces are cool.
---
So where is this area that they duping in never seen any info on this before
---
Noone really PvPs anymore aint true. Market prices are still mostly caused by PvP demand not PvE demand.
---
TSE builds were indeed overpowered with no downside. Bloodied doesn't have the same damage as old TSE but it has a big downside , the low HP. But dupers have learned, they will dupe a lot of each possible build so it will never work in case they choose to nerf one.
---
Hoping to sell my 7,777c Mutagenic Waste or my 7,676c Ivory grip plan.
---
I don’t disagree.  I’m just saying that you may be fighting a lost cause.
---
It's the same game you played before. If it was technical issues that drove you to stop playing.... I'd say jump back in. They've improved server stability greatly. But no, they haven't turned it into fallout 5.
---
Same to be honest but with two screens i always check my challenges and update the sheet at the end of my sessions. Atleast I’ve done it the past two days and damn its much better to keep track with that than to go in and check each individual challenge every fucking time fuck that.
---
Great suggestion for improvement yeah just wanted to help. :)
---
No. You can collect it from the water below the rad arches and the big tanks as fast as you can collect dirty water from a stream.
---
The caps just need to stay in the machine until you decide to take them. Works for everyone
---
Thats not what's written. Whats written is that instead of having 100% chance to work, each piece has 75% chance to work. You might get shot once and all of them would work and next shot noone of them could do. Assassin sentinel never made anyone immortal.
---
Xbox, good sir. I have quantum grenades already but no nuka. :)
---
How much for both
---
If ur on Xbox, I’ll take 200 of them
---
Figured that one or the hard way: some folks came to "help" me defend my workshop the other day, then went and contested it after the event completed. I thought "what the hell, I'm almost ready to log out for the night, I'll let em have it"; went to scrap my crap and they up and ganked me as I was peacefully walking out of the area lol.
---
Nvm someone just came and bought them from my machine my bad if I come across another I’ll let you
---
Know
---
does that area's name end in "G" ?
---
I seen one of those for sale at some guys camp on PC. lol
---
Maybe I should sell the GAS certificates for my Chryslus Corvega
---
K
---
P4
---
Some of the sources are a bit dated, but I definitely appreciate it!
---
As someone who's traveled around quite a bit, where would you want to live, and what would you consider the "financial means"? I only ask because I've known people too move to Thailand /Philippines and live like Kings. Thought they never actually emigrated officially.
---
I understand that the financial life in the US is tough and very unforgiving but I'm more under the impression that it's the greatest county due to the liberties it's people are granted.
---
Personal gun ownership and the ability to bring it anywhere is amazing and unheard-of in many Nations.
---
You also get to see all your late night comedians host TV shows and talk garbage on the government. Again, that's unheard-of nearly world wide!
---
That all said, I understand it's anecdotal and just and outside perspective from someone who's seen how much better the US can be than other countries.
---
Well shit
---
Oh yeah all the people who "accidently" made 300 boards, then "accidently" dropped them and a bunch of God-roll 3* legendaries right next to their friend/alt-account 🙄
---
LOL.  That's really funny.  I can't wait to act scared, play to his ego and give him some radroach meat so as not to waste a bullet.
---
I felt terrible after being greedy enough to kill defenseless brahmin at Flatwoods for their hides, just because I was *this close* to finishing out leatherworking challenges.  I hate antagonizing and preying on the weak, I actively avoid killing small animals and mega-sloths, but one was already getting attacked by the supervisor from Fertile Soil, so I justified it in my head that I could at least give it a one shot death (plus revenge on the supervisor) rather than it eventually dying after a thousand tiny laser burns.  It was at half health already, so it was time to end the misery.
---
I kno. I need to get rid of em 😂😂
---
Also, if everyone in the game is a vigilante, I doubt Bethesda would ban us all.
---
What plaftform are you on friend? :)
---
You should do it in water. Two for one.
---
We can agree there, just sucks when there's basically one place for the community of 76 to congregate, and a good portion of the community has to be lurkers or avoid talking about their interest in game(referring to PvPers/raiders) or they're shit on.
---
You've become addicted to nukashine
---
Im online now, add me rams_man
---
You have to go into another basement part in the Airport! You will find the HQ door in the old trader's room and on the opposite side of that door you will see another door that you have go through and descend down the stairs! You should find a corpse down there that holds the keycard in her hand! : )
---
Took me a while to figure out, heh.
---
People duped nuka-colas also. You might never trade with anyone again :(
---
Had one person buy a 300 cap piece after taking a t60 plan (believe it was motion assist)
---
Hmm not sure how,but i guess multiple ways to trigger this. I was crouched at my own camp and completed challenges and gained the weapon reward. No idea which actions specifically triggered it. But for sure was my own camp, not at someone elses when they log off.
---
Anything that another player purposely does to cause you grief, is griefing. Knowingly ignoring enemies that spawn because of their actions as they damage your camp is griefing.
---
Added, thanks
---
True assholes are people selling a 1 star pipe pistol for 2k
---
What do you play on? Pc, Xbox, ps4
---
I have lots of parts except the stingwing barb. Any locations you guys know of that have them?  When I go to the location marked on the map I usually only have 2 spawn in and generally just 1 drops the barb.
---
Where you launching? Prime?
---
Still need someone to make one?
---
Thank you! I had no idea, I've never claimed a workshop to process materials, I hadn't even noticed they had their own type of node. Much appreciated!
---
These are the moments that make this game so much fun.
---
Mine shows up as misc
---
Industry/mining ruined the toxic valley and ash heap pre war. Charleston was actually destroyed by a flood when the raiders broke a nearby dam. Everything else is just from the world going to shit.
---
damn, they do seem pretty tedious sometimea too
---
Nothing in the game comes even close to a min/max Bloodied build.
---
Bethesda's balance isn't the best.
---
Whitespring. I'm farming Flux.
---
Thank youuuuuu
---
Tbh I just healed a stranger during the Imposter Sheepsquatch event. Easy peasy.
---
If it’s really cheap and a 3 star I’d buy it, and if it has bad effects then just trade it in for legendary scrap
---
Like I said, I don't know a ton about it, just bits and pieces I've heard. I can't imagine that there haven't been people that accidentally duplicated items, though.
---
a acreen shot is fine. im pretty advid in building glitches. i can tell from there
---
yes! add me
---
I tested that when I had it awhile ago, it doesn't seem to.  Was afraid of going to WS when I did have it, lol...but seems to not affect them. I think it affects the Watoga bots though....can't remember exactly.
---
I know but what others are out there
---
That is how I remember it as well: if you're over the hard limit (1800-ish lbs, depending on that character's strength etc.) the only option you'll be given is to destroy items and stacks of items until you're below the limit again.
---
If you, OP, are even able to log into your account, load up one of your mules or your main (I'd go with the one that's closest to either Vault 76 or Whitesprings), build a new camp there (if you can), set up generators and vending machines, and try to mark stuff from your stash for sale in them.
---
If the above works: fill up the machines with the heaviest weapons first, and price everything at zero caps (or 10 caps or whatever). Now just wait until players empty out your machines, or stop showing up, then refill and server-hop.

If you can't place a camp or vending machines, and in general: start destroying the items, don't hesitate! I'm guessing you simply kept all junk, and every standard weapon any enemy ever dropped? No one is interested in those, anyway. If it's all rare and legendary gear, well, keep the really good stuff and destroy the rest. You are doing server performance a service!
---
I think I was on your server earlier and bought flux from you. Your camp is awesome!
---
I agree I'd like this post to get pinned or for somebody to pin something letting people know this so hopefully I'm the only one this happens to
---
Spread the word lol
---
I'm not at all talking about them. Those are people clearly exploiting issues in the game, not someone who's wondering how they suddenly have two of thr same item.
---
5head
---
Instigating stealth sniper is quite good and lots of fun.
---
I believe they are random. I started using the magazine perk and have found 1 so far.  I feel like it’s going to take forever to find the other 4.
---
If you get the chance, FO4 is an awesome game. Huge with lots of decision influenced outcomes. Thanks for the armour tip!
---
There are many builds. Instigating Rifleman, Vampire's/Faster Fire Rate Heavy Gunner, Stealth Guerrilla/Gunslinger, Melee in all its forms... there's even people who run around throwing grenades.
---
I truely love this idea but I remember a youtuber explaining how it was easy to get around the system using technique of smurfing, its when you create a new account then perform the action and then give the main the item you duped. Its what they did with Developers room where they had a new account run in and get the items then drop it off before getting banned. So only real way to ban them is IP ban and even then you can change IP if you really want to. We just need Bethesda to get the stuff together and stop creating so many duping exploits.
---
The whole great war was caused because someone jerked it too close to the big red global reset button. True story...or not I don't know.
---
I disagree, but say they are, then what? Lmao
---
You make them feel bad? Being called a griefer is laughable, because most of you in the wasteland throw it around like it's nothing. Only thing that word has any use for in this community is being able to tell when someone is salty, which already means you lost that battle if the person actually is trying to grief you.
---
At the station? No luck
---
Dont enjoy singleplayer games 😆 but yer welcome!
---
It's crazy annoying.  I wish they were all misc quests that we could track on our screen and see what still needs to be checked off the list.  I've taken to keeping a piece of scrap paper on hand, manually writing out what I need to do, and strike through it when I complete it.
---
Honestly, why can't we track challenges like quests in our HUD?  I can track them in my map and get a little noise when I complete some part, but I have to go into my map and them click on the menu to see what I still need to do.
---
Ah so you have no actual point. Thanks.
---
I love it exploding ice lol. Do you really use it much I think I have seen someone use the cyrolator maybe once, do you use super duper and ammosmith to make all your own ammo? No one sells the cyro cells haha
---
Calm down man
---
I'm never drinking nuke cola again lmao
---
"griefing is anything that upsets another player"
---
But I have no point, just like this response. Go and read what I said to the other guy if you want points, he was at least worth the discussion but I'm not typing it out again for you.
---
man wouldn't that be rad
---
I gave away a lot, but I kept cool ones in my storage just for this update. Some I knew I need to hold onto
---
Nope just that one elusive piece. I'm pretty set with everything else. 
---
Trying to unload my own stuff too lol
---
Aha i see what op meant now thanks, it's a bit rough yeah. In a way I wish we didn't have to focus on defense because building and shit gets way more peaceful. It's like meditation
---
Would love this, tired of having them be so weak but then again they aren't weak vs players but weak to bullet sponges.
---
whats a legacy weapon?
---
I would be extremely surprised if they did anything about this in a relatively fast manner.
---
I suspect this is going to be one of those things that gets fixed and breaks every patch and actually never works as intended.
---
Better get used to ripping your hair out when trying to do anything.
---
Whatever the problem is it is definitely bugged because the crossbow for me didn't lose a single point of condition after hundreds of kills.
---
+Karma
---
Fucking ridiculous, prick selling AAE Laser rifle for 12k, happily admitting he's duping and has tons of customers. Worst yet, dickheads know this is duped and buy it off him. Just sad and pathetic
---
I noticed this with my Horned Shepard's Crook during a Free Range event, bloodbugs attacking and VATS would not let me hit any of them. Same when I did the Campfire Tales Event. I don't often use melee, but when I do, I like to hit things with my Crook. I was robbed of the kills anyways.
---
What would be a PG-13 alternative?
---
I'm really trying my hardest to think of a reason why Bethesda doesn't want to add half width walls. Well maybe its the same reason they wont add different textured walls.
---
They want all camps to be squares that looks identical to each other.
---
I'm calling PETA
---
I saw that while I was in the mire a few hours ago, I loved it
---
UPDATE: I noticed the event was up on my server a little earlier, so I jumped in again. Yup, the tesla made it a walk in the park, and luckily the other two players there had already advanced it to the collect kindling stage. 
---
No possum badge, though. :-(
---
But that will tag you and possibly get you banned . It's like you dupe, too. Oh, the irony !
---
Very much so
---
I was asking if you sold a lot?
---
I think a lot of over sensitivity worked its way into the community because of the reaction fans of the game received from detractors.  I think as survival becomes more established people will be more accepting of more aggressive play styles, because people will have more of an option to play in their chosen lane.  I think the definition shift will remain, but ‘griefing’ will become less taboo.
---
That and the one where you press the place down button and nothing happens, no error nothing.
---
Also, the one where it says that its clipping but there is nothing around it or any possible way that it would be clipping with something
---
The real "Bethesda Pls" should be to ask for sub-challenge progression to be tracked/use pop-up notifications.  
---
Weekly/daily sub-challenges could also benefit from this functionality.
---
True.
---
But I for one, am not really effected by this issue at all, and won't be risking my 300+ hours to have a fun time with the Support Team.
---
Its just not worth it.
---
Summary : go to the nearest train station and read the posts on the wall. Good luck !
---
I concur. And my food is spoiling faster
---
Yeah me too and I always heard ppl recommend this place but damn they weren't kidding
---
Immersion! I love it!
---
The blinking portable toilets are the exit. I'd suggest watching a guide on YouTube because I can't explain the whole thing on Reddit. But you need to be where they're marked as Silo (Alpha/Bravo/Charlie) on the map - they're always a hidden elevator with a palm scanner
---
I'm trying not the get sad by the fact that they ignore the stairs so hard.
---
Almost every camp already looks identical to each other, the stairs where there to add at least some diversity to the interiors but no. Of course they are broken beyond repair
---
Thanks I will
---
No. There is no single player fallout 76. You will always be in a world with other people.
---
There is also no need to interact with those people if you don't want to. You can play the whole game solo.
---
I have a legit dropped TSE Gauss myself. How's it working out for you? I retired mine after the TSE nerf. They went a bit over the top with the Gauss.
---
Aside from hoarding *** legendary gear for the vendor, same here.  Once I burn up my stock of legendaries to turn in for scrip, I'll probably be at 600 with 3-4 heavy-ass 2-3* lvl 20-40 legendary rifles and a dozen or so perfect *** armor pieces held in prep for prestige leveling.  The only time I ever wish I had more scrap is when I want to craft-n-scrap a pile of weapons to learn mods.  I got a really good ultracite laser pistol that my alt could use, burned through the 50 ultracite I kept around immediately, and started actively mining ultracite in Glassed Caverns to get more.  Then my 5 bulk acid stock disappeared and I started caring about Abraxo boxes again.
---
Damn queen keeps killing me past downed, any ideas?
---
i agree honestly. just reimburse my caps/give me caps and im good
---
I think I might just grab me a bite and a lite lol
---
Mine is stuck at Max budget no matter what is removed
---
I’m loving it! My perks are screwed up but it’s still hitting 500 damage
---
The biggest problem I see in survival is all out cheating with aimbots. At this point in the game literally everyone on every survival server that's playing seriously has full assassins sentinels or unyielding sentinels, a full team, and a stack of stealth boys and berry mentats. The difference is that one guy can dump his full 20 or 40 shots at max range with no recoil when you're returning fire in short bursts.
---
What vault did you just crawled out of?
---
Welp, the items are mapped approximately -290,000 up to 290,000. (With like 4 dp precision) in the actual game files. But you could just overlay your own arbitrary coordinate grid tbh
---
Go to a train station and there should be 3 posters, read them to get 3 new quests and go to Harper's ferry and search for a new manhole cover by using your hud to find a high level dungeon. After that try to find a tourist at any attraction or memorial to find a new, usable camera.
---
It *should* be mapped - but now I'm thinking I made a typo and it's only included the bags
---
Ive literally asked for this on at least 5 posts since go live... and yet here we still are. *sigh*
---
Et tu Handy'?
---
Craft a low level one and then bash enemies. Works quickly.
---
So they can put the cat down before it reaches the camp😆
---
Ah! Yes ok, I follow you now, my bad.  
---
A 2 or 3 \* Legendary armor piece, Unyielding being primary effect, with the additional effect being *"+1 END"*.
---
Continuing with your logic that it's some weird mechanic, it really goes against conventional RPG wisdom (nevermind established FO mechanics from 3 and NV, IIRC) where Endurance increases Health Points, *no matter how it's applied*.  
---
And yet..... as you said, Psychobuff's increases function as one would expect: My Base HP is 280, "+65 HP" and "+3 END" ^(\[+15 HP\]) for a new total of 360 HP. Which is exactly how much I have after taking Psychobuff!  :\\   
---
"It just works!" lol \*sigh\*
---
they kinda proved your point.
---
I just hate that everyone talks about the openness and kindness of this community, but from personal experience in game you're called so many derogatory terms 2 secs after upsetting a PvEer, which mind you isn't a problem to me as it's funny. But maybe the reason people get so upset is because when someone asks about the community before joining, they hear it's just flowers and sunshine and the raider side is left out. So of course new people especially are gonna be mad when half the community lies about the game
---
They did cap it. But the limit is 25,000. Which is also the cap limit.
---
Really? Primed or normal? I'm currently using the Instigating Explosive Lever Action because at one point the TSE Gauss merely annoyed the enemy. I may have to dust her off.
---
Sadly, No.  Only the "tooter" can hear it.
---
Mmmm cat. 🤤 My character survives on cat steaks.
---
Hey buddy message my reddit account when you're on xbox, I can build one for you :)
---
Lol - fighting over who gets to pick the music
---
I believe it’s normal
---
Thanks you I definitely will
---
If this method is common knowledge, they are not going to ban everyone. It's the best way to save the economy.
---
Don’t bring junk
---
You can get a built crossbow at the Palace of the winding path
---
Legacy weapons are being duped by the thousands. The only weapons that aren't supposed to be dropping are now the most common weapons.
---
You can also activate those by shooting them.
---
No i am not.
---
Make sure you use excavator armor and go thru the secret passage. You'll get tons.
---
🤦🏻‍♀️ nvm
---
I got banned for a week a day after joining this forum for naming a griefer and inciting a witch hunt for others to hunt him down, I was angry and new to this and as a result, it was a lesson well learnt. In terms of cheats, dupers whatever else we call them, I urge all players to contact mods and discuss concerns in that manner - report and leave it with the correct people.
---
I need railway rifle plans also if reasonably priced. Same name as here.
---
What economy? There's not really one. Folks on Reddit sell stuff for 100K caps. Folks that have no business with trading platforms sell stuff as they see in NPC . It's a free market.
---
there was a glitch where you could infinitely disarm nade bouquets. probably assuming theyre leftover from that. i agree if you play every day since launch its possible, but the weight? gray area for sure
---
The most recent SBQ I did we got her down past her regen to 50% then spent 10mins pumping bullets, mini nukes, enclave missile strikes etc on her with no reduction in health so I assume she was bugged but most times we manage with lots of time to spare.
---
Perks are arguably as important as the weapon, I maxed heavy gun perks and switch them in when I go to the zone. With stabalised and heavy guns I can use 15 points of heavy perks just to use my. 50 cal.
---
I have a QE Western... but with +1 Perception. Sorry.
---
Srsly, this would be *awesome*!
---
🤣
---
At least when you have multiple pieces it does a bigger barrage
---
Interesting. At least now I know there may be hope of finding the owner of the shop nearby
---
My favorite is I create fake eBay account. Link a prepaid card to it, out bid people on stupid duped weapons. Never pay. It wastes the sellers time because you have like 5 days to pay before they can list again.
---
It's a free market economy.
---
Aquiring rare in game items is literally being watched for if you happen to find or acquire a few say TSE weapons within a 30 day window. 
---
Nuka colas, ammo, 3* legendary... 
---
Be careful and don’t be shocked if you get that login error... not kidding...
---
I just use 3 rank Traveling Pharmacy for standard looting/questing and picking up chems to make my 1400 daily caps, but swap in 3 rank Blocker for difficult fighting.  Once I got my backpack, I dumped two STR points and one INT into Luck for the option of either 3 rank Serendipity or 3 rank Psychopath, and it was well worth it.  I opted for Psychopath and swapped out Class Freak for Better Criticals during a Free Range event today, and the DPS boost is fucking astounding when coupled with 3.5x sneak damage at night.  I chunked the hell out of that squatch even while living at nearly full health, and held off to make sure the other guy was getting his shots in.  No bloodied build needed.  Instigating Handmade Rifle drop, which sold for 499c in less than 30 minutes.  I got a couple caps for the horned crook mod, too.  I sold it for 99c.  I may have made a couple caps from the bones and horns, both of which sold in minutes.  I asked for 9 caps each.  I treat my vending machine as a public service, not a get rich quick scheme.
---
Sounds expensive for the dupers, having to buy a new serial after each ban.
---
WHATDAYA GET? ANOTHER DAY OLDER AND DEEPER IN DEBT
---
Don't need to be sorry, it's still an awesome weapon! I'm just a little picky
---
Way better than most of the ideas on here that promote grinding. This would be great and if they were able to get the license for all the old songs from 3 and New Vegas it would be great.
---
I don’t know if it was glitch early in the game but I recall one day after a patch the water became clear. I know this because I avoided traveling through the ponds trying to find safes. 
---
However once the water was clear I did see fish :)
---
sell them for way less.. but then again most people either grind, or farm for their own
---
Yes to this!  I was missing this functionality starting back with those "get smashed" weekly challenges and again now with the merit badge challenges.
---
Everyone who duplicated items did so by clearly exploiting issues in the game.  Just like no one "accidently" happens to come in possession of the account numbers and personal information from a bank.
---
Start over... I started a new character fro. Scratch with deep pocketed armor and a few legendary lower lvl items and it rocks especially now since you don’t have to worry about getting killed by players...
---
With all due respect man I hope you're wrong. Camp building is the real endgame for a lot of people and it's essentially impossible now.
---
Again, how are you better if you sit down at the table and basically do as everyone does - buy a damn weapon? You're getting same duped stuff. That's my point. It's better to delete this than have even more people using this shit. Seriously.
---
Yeah this is the end of the game for me. I've never come across something this tough in almost 30 years of gaming. Wasted all my stimpacks and ammo trying to beat it solo. I don't play teams. If I wanted human interaction, I'd play COD or some lame bs. This teaming up online shit has ruined fallout. I've been playing it since fallout 3 was released, so it's a pretty big disappointment. I'm not one of those losers that has no life and plays all day. That's why I love rpg's. Shouldn't have to rely on people you don't know to have fun and succeed in a game or rl.
---
I just wish it would’ve blown up.  It’s such an important build for the community.  Hahaha
---
You get a ton of ore and other items not too mention killing at least 2+ dozen mole miners... it’s a good farm quest!
---
###Nice, N^i^c^e
---
Sure, I'll just drop it off in my totally not full stash
---
I mean I’ve been playing since release and I’ve only run into Pvp situations maybe 15 times.  I don’t seek it out, but I don’t mind when it happens. I think a larger portion of the community is PvE - so they will be the ones who have the largest share of the narrative.  Someone should start a pvp/survival mode subreddit as a counterpoint to the sunshine and daisies of communities like the filthy casuals.
---
Now this is a post I can get behind.
---
Had it just landed when it “took all that damage”?
---
Tenderiser doesn’t do much at all -_-
---
Manage your stash better
---
only if they all focus fire. if everyone is shooting something else then no
---
Yep.  This exactly.  Like my post last night I’m legit thinking they did this on purpose.
---
Same. Has been happening on PC since last patch.
---
So I did what you said and reset my xbox, but when it turned back on, I wasnt at Site Charlie. What do?
---
Yeah haha, I get that.
---
Had it lockup on my one x as well a few times, but this seems much worse than anything I've seen since the last patch.
---
Did you try a full shutdown? Holding power button for 10-15 seconds while off?
---
Thanks. 
---
The 2h weapons like the fire axe / super sledges go to 1h while wearing power armor, so my confusion is 
---
Are the 2h weapons still 2h weapons when it looks like they’re only 1h in power armor?
---
Will do next time I get on
---
Nope! I'll keep the armor. Thank you for your advice my friend!
---
I've been using that trick on the dragon. Sadly no longer works
---
This is an amazing idea.
---
Are you getting the out of budget message?
---
Remember that the weight reducing perks don't work for your stash, and this is really where things are stored for vendor, punchbowl, and fermenter.
---
I had something similar at camp adams. I wasn't in power armor but i got stuck in place all i could do was emote and look at the map. Tried fast traveling but i was stuck wherever i went.
---
What do mean about the last part regarding not getting killed by players.
---
What platform are you on?
---
I havent gotten that plan at all and have done the event every day since the patch launched
---
I think you’re the only one here that thinks that.
---
We gots tender skins and all that scrubbins leads to the oofins.
---
You're not doing as they do, you're preventing them from doing it. If every server has someone trying to stop these people, it will significantly reduce the amount of items duped.
---
Screw that, putting up with shit like this is getting old. 
---
Every single patch it's either Bethesda secretly increasing thirst and hunger drain, nerfing legendary spawns or making gear degrade faster and twits like this can't even be bothered to put down even the bare minimum required info like HOW LONG it takes for their thirst to run out that it's suddenly so fucking bad.
---
Do you mean the door? If so it sometimes happens on all doors for added content due to server lag, walk down the road and come back and the door is usually available.
---
What if you attack the robots and start a war in there?
---
I once had to defend a workshop that I had claimed agaist 3 scorchbeast. Wasted a bunch of ammo but at least I got like 4-5 plans from the reward
---
So the people buying legacy weapons for 1k each from vendors will all get banned? Not a good move from Bethesda.
---
I only killed 3 mole miners lol
---
Imagine the crap you would have to listen to
---
I tried, they only focus you and the servers keep serving.
---
Of course there's the soon™ issue, and the possibility that bethesda might go back on their word here and not ever bring them back (wouldn't be the first time), but in good faith we currently have no reason to believe they are gone forever. Even if they release it back under a different kind of effect (i.e plasma explosions like those in FNV), it will be much simpler to apply this as an umbrella change to all explosive energy weapons than to create a new effect and keep the old ones, so chances are once the change comes it will retroactively be placed on all currently existing explosive energy weapons as well
---
Something similar to what the Destiny community uses. Would be nice
---
Is your stash full? That's the only factor that you didnt mention
---
I feel like the first amendment is one of the very few things that America actually gets correct.
---
But even then you have to contend with the militarization of the police and political parties that are actively against it. A certain political party continually openly declares reporters to be the "enemy of the people".
---
Here is a great first amendment [story](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/a-reporter-declined-to-reveal-his-source-then-police-showed-up-at-his-front-door-with-guns/ar-AABev4M) from just today where a reporter (who had been critical of the police) would not reveal the source for a story, so the police basically just dress up like the army and break down his door and put him handcuffs while they seize all of his electronics and equipment (that he needs to actually do his job). Because the police force polices themselves, nothing will happen to them (they will investigate themself and find they did nothing wrong). We live in a country where the police see all citizens as potential enemy combatants.
---
It's great when a late night talk show with the legal backing of their entire studio's lawyers can criticize politicians. When you don't have those protections you are just as susceptible to retribution as in any other country.
---
You will actually find that most Americans don't own guns (despite the stereotype) and don't care about gun ownership. Although there is no real tracking of gun sales, most modern studies have found that around 1/4 of Americans own all guns in America, and around 3% of Americans own 50% of all guns.
---
This post shows up after every patch.  At this rate, the thirst bar should be emptying as fast as you fill it.  I have noticed no measurable increase in thirst speed after each patch.  The only time I notice it moving faster is when I am running around alot...because I have Speed Demon, or when I have a disease. I do have to agree that there has been NO visual proof that the bar is draining faster. Everything is anecdotal.  I would be more than happy to agree with folks if someone could bring definitive proof, but that has yet to be done.  Until then, I guess I will just continue to read these posts every few weeks when no updates show up.
---
For me.....not much. I am extremely suspicious of any legacy  explosive energy weapon. Not sure how you got it but there are so many dupes on the market right now that value is tough to say. Some people like me will avoid it and some will low-ball you because they know it can be a dupe. Thus why you got offered 10k for a weapon that 3 weeks ago was worth 50k.
---
I have a proposal.
---
A special limited access vendor who sells special power armor and mods.
---
After completing scorched earth have a ultracite power armor wearing scorched brotherhood paladin climb up out of the fissure, for ten/twenty minutes he will act a vendor selling ultracite mod plans, and potentially power armor/ items.
---
After a certain duration he will turn hostile and break out a primed weapon and fights everything around, when killed drops some minor loot, fusion cores, random weapons (possibly with prime receivers). Prime ammo for whatever weapon he drops, ect, nothing crazy, he isn't a legendary, just a really heavily upgraded opponent.
---
If your on PC later tonight, I can craft it for you just for cost of the flux.  If I remember right it’s 5 cobalt and 5 violet.
---
That's my issue with it too. Scarcity would be fine. Look at that high level player blowing everything up. What a lucky guy! Doesn't really have the same effect when 50% of the people you come across have the same god-tier. If they implemented optional wiped servers to start new characters on, I'd honestly give it a go.
---
You open the 1001th door...and a Deathclaw rushes you
---
Serums show up in aid.
---
That's a fairly extreme comparison you're making, how do you even start to compare duplicating digital items in a game to identity theft? I'm also not saying people who are clearly duping, like the ones with multiple copies of legacy weapons, shouldn't be banned. I'm saying that Bethesda could easily take such things to extremes and not apologize if they were wrong. Again, talking a tiny percentage of people here, not saying, "Oh, trust the guy with 5 sets of the exact same armor cuz he said it was an accident." I'm saying the people dropping power armor and still have another in their inventory, which happened to me early in the game. I've personally only recently become aware of what duping even was and just figured something like that was a glitch, something entirely random.
---
My point is that tax dollars are misspent. You're trying to warp into an argument about edge cases and outliers. You are also implying I'm a SJW because I don't accept a savage dog eat dog race to the bottom approach to government. As if someone is a SJW just because they're anywhere to the left of climbing up inside of McConnell's asshole.
---
Bonus bullshit tactic: your second comment implies I'm wrong because of your addiction. Go unfuck yourself.
---
I’ve been using Spotify.
---
I generally sell all plans for around 40% of the listed value. If they're incredibly useful or rare/time limited, I might bump it up to 50% (with recipes being the exception, I pretty much leave all of those at 40% or less). But if I've got a ton of the same plan (Mole Miner Gauntlet or Mr. Handy Buzz Blade, most notably), I'll knock it down to around 10% in case anyone hasn't found their own. I've got around 100+ plans still left, and I'd honestly rather get rid of them cheap to save on Stash space.
---
As time goes on, I'll probably lower the prices on whatever stays in my Stash longer, though it's hard to gauge exactly when I'll do that.
---
Those stupid things hahaha. Still trying to get those as well.
---
&gt;there's even people who run around throwing grenades.
---
LMAO i laugh so hard with this. Tks mate.
---
They had just left the DMV
---
Which system?
---
They definitely degrade on PC. But your best bet is to find the very few world spawns &amp; hope your luck doesn't push the condition too high when grabbing, or getting used ones off players.
---
I finished the challenge &amp; put mine in my shop. I'm utterly surprised by the lack of "can I has your crossbow when your done" posts. Only a few bash hits will lower it to repair.
---
Frankly these challenges are, maybe not the best way, but have revitalized a good bit of this game for me. Daily grind was old &amp; not sustainable.
---
I’m over south of the lake that’s adjacent to Dyer Chemical. It’s entirely possible that I am too close to the edge. I’ll try moving it over when I get home from work tonight.
---
Ive seen xbow plans at watoga and watoga shopping pretty regularly.
---
YES THANK YOU
---
Found some deluxe cameras at the railroad above whitespring as well.
---
U have any weightless pieces?
---
So like Modus shop?
---
It's because your perks give no resistance to poison, people with bloodied builds that rely on extremely low hp are just going to get melted by poison attacks. I've never had a problem with any of the poisonous enemies ever; you can't expect to win at every fight when you have such a tiny amount of health. I'm glad there is something to check and balance overpowered bloodied builds; there should be waaaay more things that kill you guys.
---
PS4, dropped it though as it’s my 3rd dupe
---
It's midnight for me at the moment and don't feel like turning my PC on anymore, but maybe tomorrow? I have vacation for the whole week so times not an issue. I might have those fluxs ready to go also.
---
this must be a PS4 vc PC thing. I havent seen a single TSE for sale on PC
---
Thank you! I am having trouble finding a video that shows how to get into the silos but I will keep looking. Do you have a suggestion for a good video?
---
I don't think so, but am willing to be corrected. I believe sneak attack criticals are treated as their own thing (hence why we have calmex)
---
Disease cures. Orbital strike beacons. purified water. Specialty ammo like fusion / plasma cores, cryo ammo, flamer fuel. Junk like plastic, adhesive, flux.

One of the most annoying quest lines ever!
---
The guys I was playing with kept saying how this dupe is so much more difficult than the modus one.
---
Yeah I really hate that you have to be totally stationary and no more than a few yards away.
---

I loved your idea! Email/tweet this to Beth pls! Cheers.

I saw 10000 5mm listed for 5000 caps each. I waited around for the owner trying to save them some time with a simple message but it was all for naught
---
How do i stoke the fire?
---
I was collecting wood and it did nothing
---
big ups!
---
i didn't even think of that lol but that fixed it! thanks so much!
---
Ok. I thought it was something along those lines. I can't wait for them. Lol. Thank you!
---
yep.  Moderator got mad at me :( 
---
need to be more descriptive in title.... I have been on forums for almost two decades now and its alway been you describe what you need or want in  the box below not in the title.  they say the rules have always been the same but yet i somehow see post that just scorchbeast all the time and it stays up. I post Fedora location with the help tag and it doesn't work.
---
Still, the majority of people care more about playing the game than stopping somebody else from fucking up the economy. It will never come close to everybody
---
I was actually fussing about in my camp when I heard some upset emoting. Walked out back to find a small frowny-face emote bubble popping out of the concrete steps. Poor fella got transported right into them so I popped open build mode and moved the stairs so they could get out, haha.
---
I've had quests/items and other things disappear, if I relog it fixes all those issues. Hopefully that will work for you
---
i saw someone selling a singular .50 caliber ball for 5000 caps
---
Ye i encountered as well a few times today. 
---
I love how we all still paranoid hahah
---
That makes way to much sence.. No they cant do that
---
I dont even have the ability to sell them
---
Savage 👍😁😂🤣
---
Yeah there would be problems that Bethesda would have to fix, or they could make things like the neon light letters less than 10000 caps xD
---
Was selling a ton of acid for days, no buyers so i NPC'd  all of it :(
---
And it's mostly because people in this game can't stand loosing, funny how quick they are to shoot down my friends level 15 alt right when they slap them, to then immediately call me, a player the same level as them, a griefer when I do the same or kill them after. We've done a lot of testing on it and a good portion of the community has no problem with PvP, when they know they can win.
---
Edit: as it's not entirely clear, when I say I'm called a griefer, I mean not just when I kill them after baiting with a low level. I mean by myself, not on a team, trying to engage in pvp
---
While I'm not getting the message, I think this is the issue, I'm gonna try to make more room in my budget
---
I had one that was even worse - it was telling me to collect wood, with the circles and all, but the circles were all empty. No wood, fire died, event failed. :(
---
I’m fairly new to forums and reddit in general so when I saw your title here it immediately gave me flash backs to my first post. Took me like 10-15 minutes to figure out what the hell haha
---
This isn't school why do we need a PG-13 option?
---
Just don’t do what I did and leave Weapon Artisan accidentally equipped...
---
Pass that when u done 😂😂
---
Every type of popular ammo I list at 1 cap per, sells. .45, 308, even 5mm. I can't make it fast eniugh to keep it stocked. Say what you want but it's worth what people pay for it and ple ty of people are happy paying 1c each.
---
I've moved my camp to the area just north of the Whitesprings Train Station. Been seeing quite a lot of camps popping up around Whitesprings. Felt like a natural hub.
---
Yea everyone was too busy looking for the windigo. I was standing there feedinf the fire
---
I found one near the behemoth spawn , sorta by twin lakes .
---
I actually will if i do lmao gotta share the love
---
A) Most achievements are given easily
---
B) Breach and Clear is no less exciting than any of the other launch events.
---
Good for farming ore though
---
I'm afraid I don't. I'm sure there's several guides on the nuke launch process though. It's also important to remember that you *can* skip the launch code part if you can find them elsewhere. All you *actually* need is one of those keycards, and to google this weeks launch codes

---
For regular-non boss fights PvE Vats Instigating rifles is the best pick but people will get hurt if they hear this.
---
It doesn't have the potential damage output of a bloodied build but a good instigating rifle can one-shot any regular mob, including those lvl 68 West Tek mutants, Gutsies, glowing ghouls and it can still deal huge amounts of damage vs minibosses (deathclaws, yao guai). The drawback is that you'll need a secondary weapon for bosses such as sheepsquatch/imposter/sbq. (my pick is an anti-armor 50cal rifle)
---
As to why such a build is just as good (wanted to say better but i'll get skewered to death) as the most popular builds, well, you don't have to sacrifice HP; you can stay at 100% and still one-shot anything, thus you'll rarely, if ever die. It's extremely ammo efficient. You only need 1 bullet to kill 1 enemy. If you're using (and you should) use a hunting rifle + standard 50cal receiver you'll be able to craft 180 bullets for 10 lead. That's 180 dead mobs. 
---
The slow firing rate might take a bit of time getting used to, but it not as bad as one might think. You can one-shot 5 mobs with 1 full magazine. My handmade can't do the same with a full perforating magazine. In the end it's easier to clear a group of mobs with the old hunting rifle. Gun-Fu is a must, there's nothing more satisfying than having VATS auto target and you just sit there, clicking, each click kills your target...
---
This build allows me to easily clear up even glowing ghouls and you can steal the kills from pretty much anyone. (a dick move but you could easily do it) Also, i don't have to micromanage my HP in a nuked zone. It's way more forgiving and easier to use than a bloodied build.

There's a lot I wish they'd make as official merchandise tbh. Would love if I could buy 76 themed patches, or the Vault 76 cap. (If that is a thing, I didn't know.)
---
There are small piles of sticks around the trees that when you hover over come up as "dry kindling" collect those.
---
After drinking one?
---
You only have to loot the woodsticks under the trees and the bar refills slightly, the more are collecting the easier it is. Thats why my PSA.
---
But only pick up dry woodsticks - otherwise it will not work
---
I think it was patch 7 for me when I started getting really frustrated
---
Yeah I don't see how adding Royale is going to mess up your day.
---
Sucks you ruined your shower thinking about that?
---
I have a minimum amount of basic junk in my stash and with improved repair kits coming from the queen faster than my stuff breaks, I need even less.

I keep most of my ammo on me except for fusion cores and a few others.

THANK YOU
---
Server crashed and part of the scout missions (insect parts collecting) disappeared totally for me. What do I miss by not being able to complete it?
---
I mean - I definitely run away if it looks like I’m going to die.  I think a lot of people think that PvP attackers are griefers because they so rarely interact with the mechanics that successful PvP’s use to succeed.  When you never use those mechanics it certainly looks like cheating.  Its inevitable when the systems for PVE and PVP combat are so different in practice.
---
I absolutely think it should be an option.
---
But some ammo is obviously worth 1 cap ea.
---
As a consumer, I find myself travelling out of my way if people have plans. I have an addiction to plans. Especially ones for my camp. As a vendor, though, I don't have much worth anything, so I'm afraid I can't offer much. :(
---
Doesn’t work, tried that already. You have to find it in the wild. Sorry.
---
Kind of a different point....... but they just need to ditch survival mode and put their efforts into the adventure mode. With that being said, here goes:
---
If Bethesda continues to insist on pvp all they really need to do is build an "arena" for people to fight. You could bet/win money, earn survival challenge weapons, rare cosmetics, camp decor, really just anything that will entice people to play.  Basically you would travel to an area and enter the "arena", could be multiple places on the map to add variety, including indoor and outdoor locales. There they could have team mode, no legendary mode, only knives, only fists, battle royale, paintball, tower defense, etc.  Part of the problem on the survival server is that the guys who really want to pvp can't find anyone so they resort to griefing in adventure.  These designated areas would alleviate that and reward people for playing it.
---
Also if they made the workshops worth having people would fight for them.  They need to have workshops that give you items not just junk.  Places like the ammo factory and sunshine meadow factory that actually give you a product.  Imagine a workshop that would create ballistic fiber, canned food, nuka cola, alcohol, leather, chems,  cloth, etc, etc, etc.  People would fight for these workshops and Bethesda could have their pvp mode they feel they need so damn bad.
---

Duping is theft. They are hackers being mislabeled as duper's.
---
I'm a melee fan, and I got me a furious 40% faster grognaks axe with slugger maxed, which I'm having a lot of fun with. Super sledges do more damage i believe but I hate their sound so even though mine is instigating I never use it. I also got a full set of +1 strength armor, which takes some collecting, but so does finding unyielding armor. My second character is unarmed/shotguns, which is also a lot of fun!
---
Shit I wish I had known this about ahead of time. I’ve tossed them this whole time
---
Not to mention turrets are dumb s**ts that often just sit there
---
Such a bad idea. Nobody likes other people's music and Bethesda would get sued instantly. Best you could get is to paraphrase (in the most broadest of terms) what that other guy says, you could only choose an order of songs that already exists in the game.
---
On pc, definitely doesn't degrade. Even made a second one and tried again. I haven't tried one below max level yet though
---
lol you were full of shit
---
Really? I think it's entirely possible to play kind of a lot of 76 and never realize there's a cap. 
---
There's a ton of people who dont max out their daily vendor cap, and without doing that or a lot of pretty serious trading, you would have to play a huge amount and never buy anything or fast travel to hit the cap.
---
There’s 2 roller doors the normal one you see and a red rocket one I saw once
---
I agree that duped OP gear has ruined the game, But a wipe won't really do much in the long run.
---
The problem with dupers is that they will dupe no matter what, any time any place.  These guys are the equivalent of organized crime in Fallout 76.  There probably are whole teams of dupers cranking out ammo and legendaries to sell items online for real $$.  Sites like U4GM can sell you a " Bloodied 50 Cal Machine Gun - Level 45 " for $50.99 real money.  BSG has proven that they are unable to keep duplication exploits from ocurring and no way to track the dupes once they are made apart from multiple instances of the same legendary item in a person's inventory.
---
If you wipe the server so no one has any legendaries......  All Characters have to be new and no exchanging between modes.  I give it a week before OP duped weapons start appearing and a month before we're back to ridiculous OP weapons in half the player's inventories.
---
If BSG were serious they would need to fingerprint legendaries and then start perma-banning those with multiple identical duped legendaries.  When patch Tuesday comes around they need to sweep the server of all the duped weapons that match the identified duped item's fingerprint.  If you bought a sketchy weapon then that's tough... Buyer beware.  You lose the caps you spent on the item.
---
This will never happen because a large population of the player base have characters based  on OP duped gear.  A lot of these players are the casual players that don't want nor have the time to grind to get good stuff. So they simply trade or buy sketchy OP gear and ruin the game's balance.  The straw man 'Bethesda encouraged player trading and now I'm being punished for buying in good faith' argument is ALWAYS thrown up when the ban hammer comes around and you'll see it again this time around as well.  So BSG is stuck.  When duped weapons/armor have become a STAPLE of the game, how do you go back to what was originally planned?  People will leave the game if you take away their suites of duped bloodied weapons and Vanguard and Sentinel Armor sets. Dupers have won and will continue to win forever until BSG gets a better legendary tracking system.  It would eliminate innocent players from being banned for having legitimately crafted a ton of something (bullets, etc.) and would make buying obvious OP gear a risky proposition.
---
It actually implies that I know the system because I've been in it and can speak from real life experience.  Isn't that what the left keeps telling us about abortion laws? And how men can't speak on it so I am using ur logic.  
---
The USA isn't separating families.  That's the fault of shitty unskilled illegal aliens exploiting laxed laws and taking no responsibility for their own dangerous behavior.  
---
My final point is that your view removes all personal responsibility. And blames all bad things on an imaginary bad guy.  Everything you made a case for is people who made bad decisions and don't take personal responsibility. That's shorty to expect the world to take care of you👌 👌 👌
---
Sounds like you are just getting a copy of a duped item. You are no different than they are. You just didnt put in the time to get the acquired item. You sound lower than a duper honestly
---
Darn. Gonna just have to get lucky on queen of the hunt or random spawns i guess. Appreciate the heads up! :)
---
our secret now
---
Server hop the light house for the camera. You can see the tourist corpse from where you load in after hopping. You'll need to run up the hill a bit depending on your view distance. But being able to see it from where you spawn in saves quite a bit of time. I've found the camera on 4 toons with about as much time spent as you have on one toon.
---
Same thing as the imposter or the megasloth at Fasnacht... All are busy to get the legendary but blowing the event at the same time.
---
I hope you like hell
---
I found one at Sunnytop Ski Lanes so it should eventually spawn there for you too.
---
You don't need a recipe
---
I use the often overlooked combo of mysterious stranger and revenant when I'm playing solo. Swap it out with bloody mess and ghoulish when I'm on a team.
---
vending machines cannot take anything that is not in your stash box, if your stash is full or your build budget is too much you cannot sell anything else
---
What do you do with the weapons you stole?
---
Little player little player let me in.. not by the hair of my radiated chin..
---
It's a tos not the law.
---
So aside from my previous comments, I crafted a second camera earlier incase I encountered any issues with my original camera not registering something. I put it in my stash for the time being. 
---
Just found three more broken Prosnap Deluxe cameras and looted them; figured the extra crystal would be nice. Couldn't find them in my inventory when I hit a scrapping bench, though.
---
Yea i feel you, i woudve never asked for it, but after this last patch, i am satisfied with what theyve added. Il give em the benefit of the doubt.
---
Your guess is as good as mine. The game has enough issues without making them up.
---
I don't blame you. Most people don't just play for fun though. People play for status. They want to be the richest and best geared. It's a very common goal for people that play mmos.
---
Just don't let them gang up on you and take you back to the roach hive.
---
I have a 2 star weightless combat armor chest piece with plus one int.
---
And a 2 star weightless trapper right leg with plus one strength.

If you could get 1/25 people to do it, that's all you need.
---

---
I spent the whole day going in circles trying to figure out where I needed to go yesterday lol help an old man out lol
---
It’s a great feeling not needing ammo on my melee character. I guess I should start playing him more and sell that ammo.
---
I use to own a farm the entire budget was crops. Every night while I wandered the wasteland my farm would get fucking wrecked. What if there was to have crop boxes that could be put inside or high enough up where something can't just smack it?
---
It’s just really cold.
---
If the game bugs out you can't do anything. Horrible but it may happen.
---
Otherwise it's just frustrating when 5 folks just stand around shoot at damn ants and the event fail
---
I get that, I definitely have people surprised when fighting me. But I'm referring to before any combat happens, at first slap, there's no mechanics present that should scare someone off(to be fair, I'm level 170, so nothing super high, because I hit level 130 like a month in after release and just stopped really caring about leveling.) I guess what I'm getting at, a big difference between the PvPers and the side vehemently against it, is for the first, you win some you lose some, whereas the later, PvP is only fine when they're the best.
---
My point had NOTHING at to do with whatever personal shit you've been through. Thus: straw man.
---
The US is most definitely separating families. Even your orange god-emperor admits it. He blames it on Obama, but he admits his administration is doing it. 
---
If you think I'm blaming things on imaginary bad guys then you are simply wrong. It's quite simple: the US suffers massive social ills due to bad distribution of tax dollars.
---
Wow, that is...not a bot I would've figured existed...
---
That's why you get rid of it. The economy is getting worse by the second and this is the best we can do to prevent it at the moment.
---
What part of corpse decoration (super mutants), mass murder and destruction set in the literal apocalypse is PG-13?
---
Great info ! Thank you !
---
Will tell you again that you are no better. And you do not counter dupers, you actually join them. All you do is buy duped stuff.
---
People talking shit about dupers (no i dont take sides or defend anyone) but facts are many of these said ppl use duped guns &amp; armor im pretty sure of
---
Drop them under water or something and they will disappear after a server restart.
---
I think I missed the keycard in the dead-hand. I saw the quest marker and it just wasn’t pointing to anything.
---
Good
---
There is a visual bug where the game will tell you the wrong data.
---
Like showing how many caps the other player has remaining rather than how much they spent.
---
It can go both ways, Had a player buy something and it showed them paying 20kcaps on something I listed for like 50, but I didn't get 20k caps richer, only 45. Unfortunately.
---
edit, fixed
---
My camp is just north of Flatwoods by the stream, and I had some guy come up while I was tending to it last night and ask if I had a pet Brahmin, besides the one at the fertilizer thing out front. When I said no, he sounded relieved and said he lost track of where he was and had been killing the ones in Flatwoods and was afraid he'd killed an owned one as well. Sure enough, I went to check by the Flatwoods church, and all 6-7 were worm food. (I was working on a challenge to milk 10, too)
---
Haven't had the Handy rob me nor have I been insulted yet.
---
I've seen this too, ammo prices need a rework for sure.
---
It might hurt people's feelings but you are 100% right. Right now only one voice it heard and its mostly from players who report you for taking workshops. Happens daily for me and I just wanna play the game too. But I get reported by players who are 100+ and my lv 45 kills them, all while i take their workshop. Stay in passive if you don't like confrontations.
---
You are missing the point.... THEY DO NOT GET THEIR DUPE IF YOU TAKE IT. If you drop it under water it will never be seen again.
---
I did that before on market...it just proves a deal might happen.
---
I cant help any out there with non cap trades....I've lost about 50k in guns since I started playing in Nov. I dont care if everyone thinks I'm stupid...ppl have 800 karma in reddit and decent amount in the market...I am just outright not trusting anyone now. Sell my guns or the other guy sells gun first...trade exchange at the purveyor. F$$#ing ppl.
---
It's a lvl22 so idk Why everyone wants a legendary from it
---
K nothing in their app about desktop version... but I can download each map &amp; can blow them up with in my gallery to make them usable
---
Yeah absolutely 👍
---
And they are also forced to server hop until they find a server without someone stealing their dupes.
---
Thank you! I didn’t even know you could skip the codes so thank you for the info! I will start using that trick! Can you launch more than 1 a week?
---
^and ^it ^begins ^with ^whitesprin
---
You didn’t steal anything from them. You just participated in the duping.
---
You are a troll. If you want to help just write a nice email including all the details directly to BETHESDA SUPPORT or any mod on this sub or whatever. Making a guide for every user is not solving anything. Bethesda proved they can take action and can solve things, eventually. Take it with THEM
---
I bought it. Totally worth it. Replaced my BOS knight captain paint job and that's saying a lot. It looks badass, especially with my blue headlamp.
---
Love this saga so much. I upvoted the comment because I want this series to continue forever. Can't wait for the next one, dude.
---
thank you!!! &lt;3 &lt;3

---
I already reported to bethesda three days ago. This isn't a guide on how to dupe, read it and try to understand it.
---
It happens against flying enemies, it's currently impossible to melee VATS them. But I had it happen a few times with Doggos and other small enemies. I snapped this ['last 30 seconds'](https://streamable.com/okriz) recording recently where the 2nd dog showed 0% up close so I just canceled VATS and normal punched it. The bug sucks so much that it appropriately gave me shell shock in-game to match my RL feels. Ironically I can use VATS on Scorchbeast Queen with melee, which never worked for me before. It makes me wonder if they tried to fix it and ended up making it worse.
---
Yeah this killed survival for me.. and i like pvp i just refuse to die becouse some1 has op gear.. i got 670 hours and got 2 sentinel drops with bad prefixes. Those guys have uny sent rad damage on all of their pieces, explosive lasers.. like what a fuck.. if it was one guy in 1000 it would be okay but its other way around.
---
You don't know how this dupe works. You are wrong in thinking that you are preventing them from getting the item. That is why they "don't notice you". All you are doing is participating in the duping.
---
Thanks, I'm going to post more once I have the time (and ideas). I'm not playing FO76 much lately so I'm out of the loop with new content and all.
---
If someone fast travels to other peoples bases with the intention of spawning mobs to destroy their base that is griefing... By your own definition. So it's not really a stretch to say someone who fast travels in and just watches your base get destroyed, by your own definition is also griefing. The intent wasn't the same originally, but it became the same with the same result.
---
Edit: I want to clarify that I don't personally feel like what the guy was doing was griefing. That being said I feel like it's any house owners own fault if their property isn't protected from naturally spawning mobs, regardless of how many people fast travel in. Everyone is responsible for their own house placement and defense of said house due to that placement. The sole exemption are scorchbeasts.
---
No you're participating in preventing the duping.
---
I thought you were out.
---
The word is chore. Choir is a group of people singing lovely music.
---
Yao guai are the original OP melee.
---
Then why do they hop every time you take something from them?
---
Thank you Haha
---
That was very kind of him.  I tried to tame a fox and maintain it in my camp as a lil' buddy.  The poor bastard didn't even last an hour before someone killed it.
---
I too enjoy harmonizing with my game.
---
How does the homemade rifle do these days? My only decent autos are that one and a Tesla Gun
---
It forces them to hop and find an empty world. The time that takes alone will prevent many dupes.
---
Sigh. Whatever, do your thing. I already reported you to the mods. If they allow it, then so be it. You won't stop them by writing on Reddit about their methods. You will only make it worse.
---
Nope
---
I believe the broken ones aren't considered junk, I think they get sent to misc.  Haven't looked around enough to notice whether or not the old junk cameras still exist or were replaced by the broken ones or if there's just two versions floating around now.
---
Totally, also not using Power Armor is a bliss since Fusion Cores are way less common these days.
---
No, there's no cross-play.
---
Anyone born between 1981 and 1996 (ages 23 to 38 in 2019) is considered a Millennial
---
So you're saying that every person from the ages of 23 to 38 is under the assumption that any song made by a "new" artist is their own?
---
I am in this age group but I knew that the quote was from tron and not originally from reboot.
---
And I didn't even know the Dixie chicks did a cover of fleetwood macs Silver spring.
---
Generalization aren't nice.
---
Seconded. Stellar DLC too.
---
Oh, ok
---
1200h? what a waste my dude.  if you would invest that time in an average job paying the national average of 23.00 you would have almost 30k laying around.
---
I was hopping across camps looking for some general plans and I found some dudes charging the better half of 500 caps for say, lights. 
---
Then I'm looking at the measly 5 caps I was selling mine at and just ???
---
I am, don't worry. I won't be bothering to reply to any of these kinds of posts anymore, they're just a waste. I'd put them up there with the "is the game worth playing now?" posts.
---
How will this make things worse?
---
And that's fine. It's not griefing, it's a game feature.
---
Yeah mine was a death claw each time but always found it dead
---
Yeah I got some black titanium which is always appreciated for my power armor repair
---
No but they know you bought one and they control what is at vendors. If the said process is where duper’s dump their goods to get rid of them and now you may know the process, buying say 3 identical weapons stacked as duper’s has but in larger numbers I would stay away from. 
---
Many people that are higher levels maybe have received a high level TSE... it’s literally rare unless bought “somewhere” 
---
You know what happens to real people who buy stolen items? Those items become evidence and they’re taken away. 
---
So if player X sold something that was duped, to a vendor, person Y may have that weapon taken. 
---
Not saying it will but if you know it’s duped, make a ticket and put it into Bethesda... that’s literally the only right thing to do. Just sayin... 
---
Either way be careful...
---
From what I heard, it's all sony's fault.
---
That sounds hilarious tbh.
---
If you grind out all the scout token challenges to get a max level max carry weight backpack you can almost make berserker's work, with good legendary armor effects on bad armor, using the damage reduction penalty from the backpack to cancel out your armor. 
---
This whole build is just a worse bloodied build, with lower damage, less survivability against common attacks, and losing out on a ton of low health stat bonuses. And none of the high health stat bonuses help at all, as they give armor, which cuts your damage if you use it, so it's all and all not great.
---
If you want to deal a ton of damage you pretty much have only the bloodied build.
---
Well which is it. Either they notice you and leave so that you are not profiting from their activities or they don't notice you. If they don't notice you then they could be hopping in order to not draw prolonged attention on any one server.
---
Either way, my point still stands. All you are doing is participating in the dupe and with this post convincing others who don't understand the dupe to do the same.
---
I have a prime 2 star Gauss Rifle.  Good weapon.
---
Yeah im sure you are destroying the good stuff you get and keeping nothing
---
I guess it's probably unrealistic but I really hope the next gen of consoles will try to support more crossplay. If everyone could play everything together life would be better!
---
What did they do now
---
For me personally I've never once even played adventure mode, I held off on buying the game until survival came out. I don't see the appeal of forced friendly mode. But I do agree that an arena mode would be a good idea because I don't like survival mode to be seen as death match mode. I respect your opinion but whole heartedly disagree about removing survival.
---
They are against almost any cross play.
---
Because they don’t want you to make life difficult or get legendaries for free which they can sell to players later.
---
Build again a mountain or cliff and force any enemy attacks to one side of the camp. Build up concrete walls and turrets to funnel enemies into a kill zone. Concentrated fire is the kill with the turrets on high level enemies.
---
Why didn't you just  server hop initially?
---
It helps.
---
If everyone has it then it works better.
---
If you turn on pacifist mode after level 5 and don’t fire or attack other players, CAMPS and PvP is nothing to worry about unless you take a workshop. 
---
So now players can totally avoid it in adventure mode. 
---
Players wanting this literally have their own server to have at it and kill everything if they want... it’s a win win...
---
Go farm whitespring. Seriously. Not nuked, just regular whitespring. 
---
I have like fifteen broken cameras in my inventory because feral ghouls drop them pretty often.
---
For some reason you can't trade or drop them though.
---
In one situation, the person's soul intent of visiting that camp was to spawn enemies to destroy it(which as somebody you'd call a griefer, isnt even a fucking thing, like none of us do that, I'm sure a lot of people wish it were that easy) 
---
in the other they were there for a completely unrelated reason, saw enemies hitting something, and thought "huh, I've never tested this myself I wonder how long it'd take them to destroy that" and just didn't intervene.
---
But under your logic those are the same lmao
---
If they can tell who possesses duped items, how come there are so many legacy weapons being duped now ? Because they didn't know about it and never deleted/ banned ?
---
Okay, I don’t think you understand how it works. It doesn’t force them to leave. You buying the item doesn’t make it go away for everyone else. You’re wasting your time and caps.
---
&gt;Nobody likes other people's music
---
I agree but would be a separate radio station so you set it on your pip boy if you want.
---
&gt;Bethesda would get sued instantly.
---
Well i kinda agree with that, it could be a problem indeed.
---
Because "Legendary"...
---
Then why do they leave every time?
---
I see your point.  Have you been using Survival mode?  Does it help prevent this dynamic?
---
Man these guys are great at fucking things up. I had a pretty cool little bar built under mine.
---
No its not just a visual bug. Made a thread about it, but it got no attention.
---
How do you get camp Brahmin?
---
Me too, if I want to check out a players vendor I sometimes get stuck in the floor
---
Cool, thanks for the clarity.
---
I, like the OP, am downloading now after playing at launch then breaking since around late December.
---
Looking forward to getting back in.
---
Guess I can never friend someone irl if they are on PS4 or Xbox1.
---
I had the same problem and gave up after 10 reloads, went to the palace of winding path where there is a fixed crossbow spawn and got luckly with a lvl 45 first time.  
---
From the front entrance outside just keep to the left (towards the cemetery to the west). it is on a table by the cliff, near the tinkers work bench if you've been before.
---
Got mine at the Harper springs robot.
---
Dude. Not hating, just giving you a little info about white knighting dupers from some who did the same thing back in January. Youll get baned with them, dont risk it, report the players and leave the server is the best route to take. Dont make the same mistakes i did.
---
The imposter is impossible because no one seems to want to be a conduit. They just want to kill the robots. Never been in a group that succeeded for this reason. People don’t pay attention.
---
Thanks friendo. XD
---
Go to the mine by White Springs, you’ll have at least 8-9 mile miners outside provided no one has killed them yet. Plenty of steel from their weapons and black titanium plus more junk all over that place. 
---
Go during uranium fever event and you’ll literally be overweight before you leave farming everything. 
---
WV Lumber is a great super mutant location that’s easy to farm and again a lot of free
---
Stuff!
---
I've noticed this, but it also bothered me before the patch. 
---
I cant remember the perk, but it's the one that gives you the well fed and well hydrated buffs. Well hydrated only lasts for around 5 seconds while sprinting and then I have to drink again. It's basically a useless perk card.
---
I think based on unreleased assets, there will be an arena.
---
I found them at the super super mart  BoS vendor in Watoga, think I've seen em at Watoga Station as well.
---
You can launch 1 per silo per server per (I think) 6 hours approx.
---
Basically it's kinda unlimited - you could launch from Alpha, launch from bravo, launch from Charlie then hop servers and repeat it all.
---
Worth noting as well, the codes reset Tuesday morning EST, and if you type the code wrong it will eat your keycard and you'll need another.
---
Yeah... Is the same with the Unstoppables #1-#5 for the 'Collector' challenge. 
---
Gonna be a while for that one... In 1140 hours I have found only #3-#5 *sigh*
---
Tbh the game is already ruined for me. The economy is what I play for. If they're going to ban me, so be it, their loss. I only stick around because I'm hoping they make a new server that's a fresh start for eveyrbody.
---
and yet you replied to my question
---
It does take more damage on the ground anyhow right? But it was in the air when it's lifemeter started decreasing rapidly.
---
I only think it's a BR mode because Wild Appalachia is almost over and they didn't even tease the next chapter. They wrote SO MUCH about the god damn camera that you will think if a new story update would come they will write a new roadmap for it. Just my opinion.
---
Also, don't really care about spitjuice, angrydoe or anyone else. They all get their news from here.
---
&gt; In one situation, the person's soul intent of visiting that camp was to spawn enemies to destroy it(which as somebody you'd call a griefer, isnt even a fucking thing, like none of us do that, I'm sure a lot of people wish it were that easy)
---
Yeah it is. I've seen it happen lol.
---
&gt; in the other they were there for a completely unrelated reason, saw enemies hitting something, and thought "huh, I've never tested this myself I wonder how long it'd take them to destroy that" and just didn't intervene.
---
&gt;But under your logic those are the same lmao
---
No, you're having a hard time reading, I guess, so let me reiterate. **The results are the same and while the initial intent isn't the same, it did become the same.** As such it's not a big stretch to also call that person a griefer. At no point did I say they were the same thing, I said the results were the same.
---
It'd be a totally different story if the base belonged to himself, but it was someone elses base.
---
Yeah ok.
---
You would have to repeatedly gain and lose speed demon to accurately test it. Doing it once wouldn't really be enough to say for sure. Kinda hard to do that without losing any other mutations. Not a surprise that there aren't many people willing to do that.
---
Thanks. I guess it must've been that then. Pretty cool perk then actually.
---
Sometimes I wonder if the sales are real. I priced items at 25% less than the lowest I saw after several server hops. I get lots of visitors, but no sales. Then I price something with a random number, and it sells. It's all really surreal the way it works, but oh well, it's very easy now to rake in my 1400 vendor caps per day.
---
I’ve started a new character after this update with low level legendary armor and weapons. Of course knowing where everything is helps a lot but you also know where to go on all the events. 
---
New events and daily events are pretty fun also! Player vending adds a way for you to make a lot of caps on top of selling daily so you can buy better items!
---
Probably because they don’t know you.
---
Show us on the doll where he did a bad touch.
---
A generator?
---
I'll certainly share it next time.
---
Big dreams.
---
Sorry you had to do all that just to make them work though - I suppose it depends on what exactly you're using to view them. I had no issues and didn't know there was anything up until people reported it to me
---
I dunno, I'm looking at similarly to how they handle Fortnite but that's probably too different.
---
I asked this the other day. When your on the page, on mobile, click the three dots in the top right corner then change the flair.
---
You get 'Queen of the Hunt' as a daily?
---
I thought it was bugged for everyone!
---
I cannot say I am not envious...
---
I would love it if they would too. Clean slate with no dupes would be nirvana. But dont let people breaking the rules ruin a great game for you.
---
Finally got the chance to go back online. Just wanted to let you know if you're still available.
---
I'm selling a single action ivory grip plan for 25k
---
Okay cool. Thanks to everyone for the discussion!
---
You might be thinking about the traveling merchant. I remember seeing it as a deathclaw. This guy looked like a not too fresh but not green corpse and had a greaser outfit
---
Thank you for everyone who told me my last post I wrote choir not chore..
---
Same! 45 server hops between yesterday and today and just that little eyebot bastard!
---
Still full of salt(which again is fine, other than the food builds who just don't understand PvP), played survival predominantly when it released and tried it again recently. For the resources required for PvP, the caps earned are pointless, can't even pay for the fast traveling needed while getting plenty of kills. How can I then justify even using ammo, repairing my armor, or drugs and stealth boys.
---
nice b8 m8 ✌
---
*DAE CAN'T BELIEVE WARHAMMER STOLEZ FROM WORLD OF WARCRAFT?!?!11*
---
I'm with you, that stuff is irritating!
---
Excuse me a moment. My lawn... *there is an intruder upon it.*
---
45 here...and still nothing!
---
Yeah that’s it travelling merchant death claw .. anyone seen any alive
---
Its someone being an ass
---
Lol, yeah, I was pretty off base. I'm now going to write DON'T  DEAD OPEN INSIDE on my camp, down someone in PVP, cannibalize their corpse, and blow them up with a nuke grenade.
---
Some day... Some day.
---
Excellent patch!  Here is a personal list of things I still think the game desperately needs:
---
\- **\[BUG\]** \- Hooded Rags taking up all armor slots, not counting as outift
---
\- **\[BUG\]** \- Weapon magazine always empty after loggin
---
\- **\[QOL\]** \- Possibility to change the quick slot hotkeys
---
\- **\[QOL\]** \- Separate throw grenade key from bash key
---
\- **\[QOL\]** \- Prevent player from scrapping favorited items ([there is a HUGE problem with the current solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bbdyg4/the_favorited_item_protection_against_scrapping/))
---
\- **\[QOL\]** \- Quick eat / drink / read button ([https://imgur.com/gallery/ALXbj5S](https://imgur.com/gallery/ALXbj5S))
---
\- **\[QOL\]** \- Please change the workbench repair menu to be on the first screen again
---
\- **\[PLZ\]** \- Perk cards loadouts
---
\- **\[PLZ\]** \- Fast travel mat at C.A.M.Ps (this just got way more needed now with player vending)
---
Love the game!
---
It already did ruin it for me. I spent countless hours collecting rare items the legitimate way and it way all for nothing. What I valued most about the game is gone.
---
weren't you, you know, out?
---
I was on my way back to try and erase that comment too! Yeah, I found them under Misc a minute ago. I'm not at all good at this, I'll be quiet now!
---
But that aside, I haven't got the NV lens yet. I haven't had issues with the 105mm daily challenges... Yet.
---
You sure it's still viable? Bethesda took down the game a couple times after they released the patch. This was to address a bug being exploited (dupping i imagine)....no real details were provided but i assumed it was fixed already.
---
A plan for something like a weak pistol seems completely useless in terms of game effectiveness. If you just want it to be compelte, sure, but when I see plans for an item that I would just scrap if I found one, it is *not* thrilling.
---
I can vouche for this, it was a big mistake. Something i really wish id have thought about before i did it. Dont make my mistakes people, just play the game and ignore the exploiters the best you can.
---
Posting it here isn't reporting it as much as it is publicizing it. You're ensuring more people will do it by giving the YT name.
---
I’ve been saying this for a long time. I don’t think you’re wrong at all. I’d absolutely play through the main story and do everything over again if it meant a game free of dupes and cheese.  
---
And don’t let reddits false consensus tell you otherwise.
---
🤦🏼‍♀️
---
October comes before November, it would be less time played, not more. This makes me question your earlier math, if it was worth the time.
---
I'd love to have those like we did in Fallout 4, how it is now I just stopped bothering with my crops.
---
Thirst, Hunger, Spoiling, and Fusion Cores are all depleting so much faster, again. Hell, standing in my pa has been depleting cores faster than running used to.
---
It's always worth checking the map when you get a nuke warning, even if you don't plan on visiting the nuke site. Because the nuke might visit you.
---
... If the duping works by player A putting an item in the food trade menu and player B buying it, how are you then not just player C also getting in on the duping action? And the item gets duped three times rather than two, only the original duper isn't making the caps off it. How does that stop duping?
---
Where is “The Nukashine”?
---
I just feel bad for the people with friends on other platforms. Why Sony WHY
---
It takes too long for that to actually be an issue for anyone, nor is it worth the time. I don't doubt somebody has attempted it, but it's not that common if at all.
---
And you're ignoring the point that those are different
---
no that many letters on your keyboard either by the looks of it :P
---
I’ll go one further, due to copyright stuff songs outside the game wouldn’t be able to be played, but due to a lack of djs in the game what if we could be djs? It would require a mic obviously but you could press a stop button on the music and talk about whatever into the radio, then turn the music back on
---
Agreed, i would at very least advise removing the youtuber name. At least then won't be easy to find for those looking to dup.
---
Im sorry to hear that, an i completely understand. Hope you find another game to enjoy.
---
Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids...
---
I keep replying because you keep inboxing me! I guess I'll just block you and walk away, hopefully that makes you happy dude.
---
The garage door basically sucks. Either you waste a ton of budget on elaborate switching, or just just wire it though the wall as a door that doesn't operate, with bad physics.
---
I ended up finding a random mothman like 5 minutes after my last post lol
---
On the ground, the melee can go nuts on it, so it’s hp gets chunked down
---
I’d chalk you up to coincidence, someone probably joined with a heavy weapon build and blasted it down
---
Wow ,I learned a new thing today...
---
Travel to real life WV, it’s filled with old well worn structures and terrain. Add 25 years, a bunch of indirect radiation, floods, and a bunch of strange monsters and I imagine you get pretty close to what we have in fallout 76.
---
Report the video to the Bethesda officials, and watch the ban roll in. All you can do.
---
Because they notice you eventually. You usually get a bunch of their stuff before they realize someone is taking it.
---
Call it what you want, but not griefing.
---
Thank you very much sir should have searched harder! Appreciate the time and effort you put into that
---
Since Friday night this message keeps popping up and Xbox support says my ports are closed so I'm F I'm at a family member house and I can't tell them to call the internet company just so I can play games thank u Bethesda for a update that 
---
screwed me over!
---
Sony being an idiot thinking their console is the best, refuse to cross play.
---
There was a tweet on twitter awhile back, which Nintendo AND Microsoft shamed Sony.
---
No :)
---
In fact, it seems to be an intended part of the game considering Bethesda sure seems to make it easier every patch.
---
If you want a creative mode, Minecraft is available.
---
You have to collect kindling at the base of some trees, not just wood from fallen trunks. Did that the first time.
---
That's great news and hopefully means they can develop a more pure survival mode and focus less on making it competitive PVP. Have you got a link to that info?
---
I already have the best stuff from countless hours of playing the game the legitimate way.
---
Heh, so many trolls. You're clearly not helping but help spreading it.
---
No worries glad it was something easy, these maps will sure come in hand for the pioneer scout quests. Thank you for all the hard work!
---
Destroying someomes base which isn't what this guy even did does not make you an asshole. Destroying another players camp is an aspect of the game so again it does not make you an asshole or a griefer.
---
By the way, you cannot openly damage bases in surival anymore. So all of us assholes are coming back to adventure ready to fuck some shit up any way possible.
---
Agreed.  It’d be nice to have a separate (and easily switchable) loadout for Combat, Crafting, and Bartering.
---
Scrap,repair shoot and use lol
---
You’re welcome.
---
Actually, if you use conduits. They are super easy to wire. That is of course assuming you know how to use ceiling conduits. I'mma make a video here in a bit. I wired my store to a garage door, and when it's open it's up.
---
Because if you buy it and exit the menu before the other dupers enter the menu, it will not appear in their menu.
---
He doesn't care about stopping it, he wants to spread the news by pretending he wants to "stop it".
---
500 caps isn’t much given the cost of the materials
---
You either missed the edit I did to my first post or you're ignorant as hell. In my first post I agreed with you that they're different, the whole point of my post was to show that it's not a big stretch to say that person is griefing. You're being pedantic and childish with your side of the argument, accusing other people of ignoring thing's they aren't and putting words in their mouths so you can accuse them of making points they are not. So I'm done with you.
---
If you already have all the “best stuff” then why do you care?
---
Indeed, it's the best update we've got since release day. There's a lot of surprises waiting
---
tadpole badges
---
How original
---
Oh no, I understand the conduits. But after inside and outside switches, multiple wires, and at least 4 peices of conduit, it's a waste of budget that looks like ass every way I've seen it done.
---
Edit: also, 3 ways swtiching is a pain in the ass to boot.
---
Well the time it takes for the to hop alone prevents many dupes. plus if you buy the item and exit the many before the other players enter the menu, it disappears, right?
---
I think part of the problem is that there's no real info on drop rates or rarity. 
---
I have absolutely no clue what items I should be watching for. I have hundreds of plans but I have no idea which ones are rare. I know that, for example, the mole miner gauntlet plan is pretty common, but that's only because I had over 20 of them without trying. I just do the uranium fever event every time I see it.
---
Nice! I’ll probably buy the fusion cores off you tomorrow if available. I’ll send you a request then also
---
No answer?
---
Yeah well if someone doesn't have any other mutations it'd be easier
---
Former PS4 player here and I must say that pc is better in every way.
---
Did Sony tweet back😂
---
Oh yeah, its a bit redic
---
Because it destorys the value of everything I have. It destroys MY purpose for playing the game.
---
To be fair I'm not reading over your past comments, by the time I've replied I've taken it in, so I hadn't noticed your edit which is basically saying you're taking both sides as to ignore any critisism. It had no more interesting points than it did before the edit.
---
Kinda make sense actually.I mean...even in real life poison and high radiation can kill people much faster than several beats.
---
So did I and it was the most heart wrenching thing to watch my farm slowly break. Unable to repair it because of needing fertilizer. Just watching my passion for my beautiful  farm go down the drain. :(
---
Same, but I’ve had the most success selling magazines and bobble heads
---
yup.. always check out the nuke.. ya never know
---
It's hardly the same feature as was designed when the game started though.  Nuke griefing never caught on even for the biggest of assholes out there because there was so little certainty, even if you found a camp you wanted to obliterate there was no guarantee it would still be there by the time you got through the silo and launched.
---
But now?  Now you can not only find a camp just as you're preping to launch the nuke but you can maximize the number of camps you could potentially hit.
---
Pressure plates and flame throwers!  One I was at today the vendor machines was over a big chasm.   Those camps I pull out my Power Armor for.
---
Sure thing, I’ll keep adding them when I find more! :)
---
I was checking out them sweet junk deals to build my ultracite set
---
If its a guaranteed thing then they would notice it first time something went missing. You are just getting a copy as well
---
Months later and I still have not a clue 😂
---
Yeah that didnt work, still not going into any of the three machines I have :/
---
Took me months of seeing it to finally ask someone this week lol
---
&gt; To be fair I'm not reading over your past comments, by the time I've replied
---
I edited it before you replied.
---
&gt;which is basically saying you're taking both sides as to ignore any critisism.
---
No, I agreed with you, but I played devils advocate so that you may unhinge your head from your ass and start understanding another fairly reasonable point of view. Instead it went further in. Congratulations.
---
And you just keep editing it so it appears different to those reading over. I replied to what you commented originally, anything past that is on you bud
---
AA doesn't work on energy weapons,  but explosice energy weapons deal explosive damage, for which AA also does not work. So not only AA is useless here, its useless twice.
---
If you have everything then it shouldn’t matter what the value is. You need nothing there for in game currency and the market would mean nothing to you
---
last thing i heard that it actually wasnt sonys fault and rather bethesdas cause they thought  crossplay is useless
---
I used the conduit lights on the bottom floor of my warehouse, so throwing up some wire one was not hard. I made a seperate keypad entrance so all my garage doors are one-way.
---
you know you dont have to reply.
---
I haven't. I've documented any edits I've made to any post. You just don't want to look like an asshole, which you realize now that you do.
---
Okay to explain it easier for you, I clicked on your comment before even the first edit, as I saw it right when you commented. Then typed up my reply and never refreshed it, and you're calling me ignorant lmao
---
https://youtu.be/KAIQ68snVMw
---
I get where you're coming from but fallout 76 has robots that threaten to kick your ass.
---
It's a random spawn, I've been finding a pipe gun variant, will server hop some more.
---
I'd love to launch a nuke that permanently kills Rose :)
---
Dang, just had this happen to me...or at least I just noticed it.  Guess I know what I'm doing for the next 30 minutes.
---
I only really look for ammo like .45 and 5.56 and any other ammo type I currently need as people tend to undersell the vender bots.
---
Yes - same way you tagged them.
---
yes, in your inventory on the junk tab you can switch to component view to tag and untag materials
---
you need to have them in your inventory to untag them tho
---
You are not taking their stuff. You are just getting one of many duped coppies of the item. Everyone of those dupers also gets a copy. If the point was to annoy them and make them jump servers repeatably you could just stand among them and jump up and down yelling dupers. But instead you hide in a corner and take a copy of the items until they notice you.
---
No, I didn't. I said you're either ignorant or you didn't see my edit. Now you're being ignorant though. Truly, I'm done with you.
---
The ZAX machine sounds very basic. I hope they add some spice to his voice to keep him from sounding mundane.
---
Every base I've built since I got the power connectors plan has been wired in conduit. I've used the garage door every way I can think of, and I've just come down to hard wiring it open. I gave up. I want a two way door that can be closed from either side. We just don't have the right parts to do it in 76.
---
I find that I tend to be too successful, most of my stuff goes really quickly so I often have little to sell. I could raise my prices but I’m trying to offload stuff here.
---
the point is a trick! not a legit sale u silly billy
---
And what's the problem?
---
It's not like it's unintended design. It's a possibility.
---
I'm gonna break it easy to you, I'm an asshole and don't care if people know that. Secondly, that doesn't really change anything.
---
Just make your xbox the dmz host. They'll never know lol
---
Sigh. Like I said earlier, you started the direct contact. You messaged me directly first. Then demanded I didn't contact you back. Really. You know where the block button is. 
---
Also, I was pretty civil in my posts and you went straight for personal insults. But hey. Whatever you have to tell yourself.
---
I explained how my original stance was based on the threat almost exactly like this posted a short time before where the "Victim" was below the age restriction for the game. Which you then complained, yes complained, about not having a good time.
---
I agreed the behavior experienced was not good, but neither is letting under age people play a game, then complaining about it. It isn't my problem you then went on and changed your story.
---
I'm glad you seem to have gotten. The closure you wanted from your experience and I hope it isn't repeated.
---
http://i.imgur.com/CVDE55m.jpg
---
And some that do! I'm looking at you, Assault Rifle wielding Mr. Gutsy robots.
---
I'll post my video latter and tag you. Also I've used preasure-plates on the inside to help make it two-way.
---
Sentiment &gt; Profit 
---
We need a comrade like her in this game
---
Sounds great! What I think they should've made instead of overpriced/fugly jackets was a REAL stuffed Jangles the Moon Monkey. Something like that people would've GLADLY paid too much for!
---
Great video
---
Theres a fissure site right over that hill by the next lake
---
Is that in the northeast corner above Cranberry Bog? 
---
If it is they spawn their daily with supermutants and scorch...
---
So let me be sure I have accurately gathered information. If I purchased or traded for a gun. It turns out too be duplicated I'll lose said weapon? I wasn't around for the first few waves of duplicating. So I'm a little saddened by the fact it's back.
---
Rabbit season!
---
Congratulations :)
---
Inb4 they do this and they're just stickers
---
Not every duper is aware that people can sneak past steal though. Also, they might blame a person in the group for doing it. They will assume someone just bought it too fast. From my experience with these people, they don't trust any body and this is start fights between them too.
---
I do not have any links, but just search “juicehead fo76 battle royals” it’s a video from like yesterday.
---
I got called a useless idiot by "Insult Bot"
---
I know i would, and quite a few of the responses I've gotten said they would give it a try as well. Im not really going to pay any mind to the curt responses I've gotten. They can totally keep their character on a legacy realm, but i don't want my session with my friends interrupted by flying tse shotgun dupers. Really turns my friends off of trying this game again.
---
I’ll be sure to avoid that area like the plague now...lol
---
No they didn't
---
How is computer better?
---
I'm sure he's enlightened now.
---
It's nice continuation of The Motherlode quest. I had hoped Mistress of Mystery and Top of the World would be like that .
---
brilliant! *claps*
---
Yeah, your math is wrong when you say "over half the day every day". The rest checks out. The average adult sleeps 8 hours or less, meaning they're awake around 16 hours a day. Unless you think most people spend literally half the day sleeping (which would be far less healthy), doing anything for ~7 hours out of every 16+ awake sounds normal.
---
Most adults work 8+ hours a day, if they worked every day it would be about the same as this guy plays video games. Are you saying that working an average number of hours is unhealthy?
---
Just putting those numbers to more realistic concepts. Perhaps he games for a living. Perhaps he gets paid well and has to work far less than your average guy. Perhaps he's just unemployed temporarily.
---
You deciding what's healthy for an internet stranger is not healthy. Perhaps you'll find better ways of spending *your time*.
---
Yep sure do
---
Links in the title don’t work
---
Having the same issue since today after the game crashed when I was afk. All other characters work just fine.
---
😂😂 but it's delicious!
---
For a FIRE SALE????
---
Thanks 👍
---
Instead of straight/angled full/half length fences, what I'd like to see is fence posts that we could connect together the same way we connect wires.
---
Haha noooo
---
Hahaha
---
This is the main reason I never/lag it on doing quest/daily's. I tell my buddies all the time it feels like damn chore's lol. I still haven't done any of the brewing/backpack quest lines yet due to this very reason. Hell, I still haven't finished the damn sheepsquatch quest line yet!✌🤣
---
In an interview Todd Howard said. 
---
You cannot do cross-play in 76,” Howard said, according to GameStar.de (via CNET). “We’d really love that but right now we can’t. Sony is not as helpful as everyone would like.”
---
Must of made this mistake about 4 times out of habit. 
---
The 5th time I cooked my radroach meat.
---
They have the neon letter signs, where you can place individual neon letters
---
Yeah but high lvl deathclaw should kill you faster than a low lvl bug
---
If you take the item and leave the menu before the menu pops up for them, the item is gone.
---
Oh sorry

Totally agree with you. I've thought that people would exploit it this way. The best way to do fix the carry weight in vending store "shared" with stash is to reduce both weapon and armor weight into 0 after you put it in your vending store. Why just weapon and armor? to prevent exploit you just mentioned, cant imagine people storing 100000 meds, junks, mods, ammo, etc (aka stackable items) with 0 weight. Expanding their stash size with 25k caps buyout on meds, junks, etc.
---
But if it's just weapon and armor I think it's still fair. Since weapon and armor are unique, can't stack them in vending store.
---
It's really hard to make a space in vending store for rifles and heavy guns (20-40lbs). Heavy combat armor chest that's guarantee 10 lbs+ fully modded.
---
You're assuming they're not already in the menu. So it sounds like this works, player A sells it to the vendor, player B (duper, or you) buys it, then player a buys it back as well? If that's the case then you exiting out of the menu doesn't stop the duping: either player B is also in the menu and also has a copy of the item, or player a just gets the original on his menu back and does it again.
---
This is like....amazing dude. ;)
---
Ages back soneonevsuggested that nuking different regions and sites would spawn different bosses... mirelirk queen ... hordes of animals in forest...big glowing boss deathclaws and yao guai ... maybe a mole miner or something from the ash heap (or autominer robot)
---
Explosive weapons weren't that hard to come by. There just wasn't a market for them before.
---
Cool sent a message awhile ago. Want me to join you?
---
Not 100% sure on this tbh. But if you feel you're trading with a duper..... Don't do it, Just to be safe.  If a deal seems too good to be true, chances are it's a duper.
---
They don't but it is visually appealing. 
---
The game is always a combo of extrapolated reality and unrealistic fun. When you get radiation in real life, you don't get to jump high and be a slam dunk good. You get leukemia.
---
Mine seems to be! So does the hunger meter. It’s so weird. I haven’t changed my perk load out or anything.
---
Sure ..... NiceTryFBI is my ign
---
10/4 thanks
---
That’s why they could limit it to specific songs, but a wider variety than the current Appalachia radio.
---
I would love that...something!
---
In my opinion it has faster loading, less lag and better aiming etc, but it does depend on what type of pc your on. But this is just my opinion
---
yup.  I agree.  I think that BSG has a 2nd chance now so I hope they make the most of it!
---
I picked it up just fine from the table at the range, read it, then at the workbench...but no crossbow? Happen to anyone else? Did something wrong?
---
Saw that just yesterday as well,.pretty neet
---
Some "too serious" jerk downvoted this joke
---
Assuming Player B(the buyer) doesn't access the menu before I buy and exit, the item will not be duped at all. You simply buy the item from the vendor that player A sold to it.
---
You lot shat me up, mothers day falls in March for the UK.
---
The post was about the hardened .50 cal, not just plain old .50 cal.
---
Player A loses his item too.
---
I haven't noticed a fissure site anywhere near here. I'm just a bit north of the NIRA site.
---
Im original flavour and your... Ready salted :p
---
Online you can get a TSE Laser gat (PS4) for about $60 a copy.  The site even has a DROP DOWN quantity counter in case you need 10 of them. This duping is getting stupid.
---
I have yet to be back there, I’ll go on and check it out and update my reply once I see for myself.
---
There have been a few posts about it, (I posted a day or two ago.) 😊 It’s pretty rad!
---
Yeah - but I wanted to have a nice opening into my workshop.
---
Just seems odd that there isnt different versions to match the various wall types
---
I call false on 1. Being discovered on compass, being vatsable etc is all dependent on your sneak vs your opponents perception. You can force your character to see enemy character via shooting them, but how easily you loose this vatsability depends on sneak perks and buffs.
---
Chameleon mutation ceases to work when you shoot, unlike the chameleon armor.
---
There's your sneak parameter against your opponents perception. Chameleon armor gives you bonus to sneak when you disappear. Chameleon mutation gives you much higher bonus, you'd need full set for it to be as effective as mutation in this regard, but its not worth it.
---
There's no point tho to have more than one chameleon armor piece - escape artist gives similar buff, and its better to use "harder to detect while sneaking" for regular all-the-time sneak than sacrificing more armor prefixes to get bigger bonus once you disappear.
---
same here lol, have yet to visit it again.

---
You're essentially just buying the item someone sold to the vendor. It will not be duped at all as long as you exit the menu before anyone else enters it.
---
Word.  Thanks.
---
Shame I'm level 42.
---
South East of Pleasant Valley station where the flower is on the map is a nice Clift over looking a stream and pond with an Acid node there.
---
I finally got my possum badges to days ago to buy the high capacity mod for bp. I just selected two badges at a time to work on. Railway enthusiasts was not too difficult and actually fun. 
---
Also, about an hour after I got the mod, I did the queen event and she dropped the mod!!! Sold it on here lol
---
😂 that’s awesome
---
I haven't and the last few times I've seen them it's been one regular deathclaw and three dead boring humans
---
Got mine for 500 caps yesterday.
---
I’m pretty sure this ones a guaranteed spot iirc? Had my plans spawn there when I played the beta, and for my 2nd character.
---
Is it per person or the entire server?
---
What was changed? I guess I didn't even notice last time I was there.
---
Yes it does I'm a commando build and I see the difference especially if you stack it with an AA weapon
---
230 for normal 500 for rare and 800 for ultra rare and certain power armor ones.
---
Yeah I'm noticing I'm feeling wayyyyy more squishy in regular armour now.
---
SBQ drops backpack mods? I’m already glad I asked this question. Thank you!
---
Just northwest of the NIRA site. Between it and site Alpha.
---
I server hopped the water park twice and got him, it spawns in the parking lot.
---
Different styles would be nice. Maybe with through wall switch option.
---
No need to. Just sit at any table and the waitress will serve your favorite gun
---
I always have to sort my Misc tab by weight to find any of my ores or gunpowder.  It baffles me that there isn't a separate "Keys" tab; the Misc tab is a total disaster.
---
I posted on it two days ago as well.
---
The way I do it is a switch on the outside and a terminal on the inside that only effects that switch. The door opens from both sides easy peasy.
---
This works. Go to Flatwoods. Bash a Brahmin to death. Repair. Repeat.
---
Edit:- Make sure you un-equip the gunsmith perk card for faster degrading. And weapon artisan so you don't repair it past 100%.
---
sure sounds good just at camp
---
I'm still plugging away at these. The gardening one was pretty easy. Rabbits and radrats were the hard part but rabbits always spawn near the WS service entrance and I got a bunch of rats from a lead run at Lucky Hole mine. I believe whatever spawns outside is also what you'll get inside, so if it's not rats you could just server hop.
---
The actual building interior. It's all different. No more vendor though.
---
You took PvE version of a tool made to make your unarmed hits deal less damage than bare fists would, and started fight with a guy wielding a rifle. Any other results besides dying would be pretty ridiculous.
---
The dupe is 100% prevented if you buy the item and exit the menu before any other players enter the menu.
---
I think it should be either 'ne' or 'nhe'...i prefer 'ne'...non gender instead of he or she...'n' is halfway between 's' and 'h'...thus 'ne'...i agree we need a word in the english language that is not gender (she/he) biased and not debasing (it).
---
I did that for a while but I got sick of the terminal animations and lag.
---
A post apocalyptic world should have bugs and glitches?
---
This is a common, known issue and this solution has been posed.
---
&gt; how do you even start to compare duplicating digital items in a game to identity theft? 
---
In both case it's being perpetrated by people who are poking and prodding a computer program with a clear goal in mind.  Neither happen by accident.
---
If you do the math, you've probably worked (if you work) about 1200 hours in the last 179 days. That's an average amount for half a year. Just because someone has more free time than the average person, doesn't make that something you should "concern" yourself with.
---
Oh derp! I'll have to check it out. Last time I was just looking for the shovel for the gardening badge which is outside, north of the location by a grave.
---
This works on PC but they take the same amount of time to do.
---
I'm an actual WV resident and I can confirm that Fallout 76 is very accurate. Even the amount of ghouls is pretty close, that's just our native population of drug addicts.
---
I can relate massively, I have a fusion generator in my camp and it's by the munitions factory and enemies spawn there and somehow they detect me from that far away and it really makes me mad about how often my stuff gets destroyed
---
I’m hoping they will implement something on the map to show how much is left on the event. It will make things so much more easier.
---
Enemies spawning on Camps is the reason it can take me hours to move my camp. I now only place my camp down on areas where either enemies don’t spawn, or there’s very little room for them to spawn (edges of the map are basically where I tend to place my camp).
---
Your remark is right imo. And it's the same for all events lately - just try having fun and focus on the challenge, do your own part what is required to succeed and i think if just 3-4 folks do that all get the event done. No matter which one.
---
I would buy one for my girlfriend for sure!
---
Found the level gun plans at grafton train station vender as of yesterday. Was about 1800 caps. I was not using any perks.
---
It looks great now. I’m glad they updated it.
---
Yeah but if I find someone i could buy it for about 1k
---
Why not?  I sell about 8000 Caps of stuff every day ... and buy about 8000 caps worth of stuff (including about 1000 caps of fast travel to sight see) ... its pretty easy ... have reasonable prices and a good stock of decent stuff (fabulous stuff is impossible).
---
I'd buy it for me SOOOOOOOO quickly
---
I've seen many people talk about it and post pictures
---
In a few more years, once someone has actually completed that.. they're going to be looked at like that 900 hour guy, with so many actually shocked someone played that much of this game. I wonder what the game will even look like that far from now!
---
Recipe, no
---
But I’ve received it as quest rewards from the bug parts one
---
Can't join your game says your offline
---
Sigh :) have a great day Kay
---
Great get ready for a flood boys
---
EDIT: and girls
---
Sigh. You have a great day too :)
---
I have a giant stairway built at my camp that we jump off of for this purpose. :) AsheeliaB is my user name and I'm there now
---
It would be foolish to punish ignorant players who buy duped items. And you can't tell who is ignorant. Even if the items are just all deleted, players won't get a refund on the caps they spent.
---
Nice that was what I wanted to do thanks
---
My guess would be not many used that vendor and it used resources in the game world that would be better used elsewhere.
---
Friend request sent
---
I thought everyone knew about this at this point....
---
I keep bumping into the female handy that asks me to help her with science, but then is sad when she realizes I don’t have a recon scope. I’ve found her twice, and I have no clue how it resolves!
---
I just got it lol, it's under machined weapons I think is what the tab is called
---
I did it in adventure mode and got it. O_o
---
Not sure if it was fixed with yesterday's maintenance. There's a new weapon to get each week in survival mode fyi.
---
Accepted:)
---
Evidence of that statement?
---
 Because , as a vendor I track my caps closely as to not hit max caps before I shut my machines down , and I had a player buy just under 2k ammo at 1 cap each and only got like 200 caps.
---
I know I'm right because I was at like 1300 caps {had just opened} and wen to a tad over 1500 caps.
---
That's some visual bug there then...
---
Lol, that challenge was actually bugged this week
---
All checks completable in Adventure mode
---
I want to do this but I know some asshole will come through, take everything of value, then turn around and resell it. As is I already price things way lower than they're valued and I've had a couple buy me out like that.
---
I have a list of hundreds of people duping with video proof. It's too bad it only let's you report one person at a time on Bethesda's site.
---
I cant fast travel to you for some reason
---
Same problem
---
I wanted to buy it too. But apparently you just get rewarded the actual item.  No sign of the plan yet.  I wish you could use badges to buy the recipe.
---
Thanks, I'll check next time I'm on.
---
I reported it 3 days ago. They probably don't work weekends.
---
Sent a team invite
---
Because legendary scrip
---
I was really surprised.  I did the queen, went back to my camp and was going through my loot and saw the plan. That's the only place it could have come from!
---
Just sent you an invite
---
So many disconnects are not common (not anymore, at least). I don't know what could be causing them.
---
Maybe next year.  It'll be a gift giving, home-cooked cramburger bonanza.
---
That would suck.
---
Np I didn't see it for a minute I thought it hadn't shown up
---
Ok thank you! Someone dropped a nuke, I was able to pick up flux, but can’t stabilize it so that sucks. But I need the pure flux and don’t know where to get that either
---
There's no recipe yet in the files or even a crafting option.
---
What can you get from Line in the Sand?
---
Why did you decide to sell it?
---
yeah, it's like the game doesn't want me to play
---
We need to have a mother's day party.  Probably a ghoul buffet or some such.  All you can eat.
---
I haven’t tackled the gardening badge yet, but it’s just jumped to the top of my list, thanks!
---
I already learned it. It said known.
---
It would be full of bugs.
---
The reason why I asked is because I read on another post that when the player purchased the mod, he got two of them. Is it possible that happened to you?
---
Haha, probably
---
I’m not banned, but have you tried Subnautica?
---
If you clear the vats and hit vats again it becomes effective is a pretty bad glitch does it to all my weapons
---
It's definitely an easier one. I found the shovel at the little cemetery north of the Morgantown Airport and the flower pot at the Vault Tec Agricultural Center by Flatwoods.
---
When they come back, it is very likely they will not have the same visual or effect. Legacy weapons may or may not keep these effects, but if anyone wants to experience them in this form, now is probably the best time.
---
Didn't get it GT is SteinLone
---
I notice and I also got booted out of the gm to since Friday my load up screen says disconnect from server it has to do something with my ports Xbox support says
---
I have it on steam. Haven't touched it since they dropped the big sub. Didnt they make an end game for it now ?
---
Maybe, it could have, but I didn't notice it in my inventory until after the queen fight. It's a possibility.
---
I'm that asshole. 😁 free and cheap I snag up and sell at market rate.
---
Not banned but I’m hearing Red Dead II is pretty awesome...
---
Wow, great video, so much cool info. The future looks really good for 76!
---
Yeah. If you haven’t played the full version yet, definitely check it out.
---
The atomic one is pretty easy. Just get a fatman and use it to bash weak enemies. Then visit silo sites and craft a few mini nukes.
---
Found one of those with my last character from the wolf hoard, regretted it because I soon found myself with no stimpacks! XD
---
Either you provide proof or the evidence provided is more solid than your claim.
---
It happens for all the events, sometimes they are really sparsely spawned or sometimes it can be pretty hairy with heavy spawns, and I can tell you how it’s triggered either way although I suspect it’s related to the number of players in the event.
---
Thank you for your input! I do the SBQ event every chance I get so I’m hopeful it’s a possibility.
---
Haven't played it yet. Have been considering it for the MP aspect . :)
---
I want to help everyone with cheap stims and Nuka Grapes! Leave some for everybody else!
---
My PSN is Grizzly_Joker_99, mind dropping it for me?
---
Will do .what's been your favorite thing added so far?
---
Similar problem with grounded enemies, vats had become useless for now in melee, may as well use blocker and have those action points doing something!
---
Awesome, that was the first one I finished as well. I already had a Fatman, the rest was easy!
---
Ok
---
Lol now I'm wondering if I already had it and just didn't know. I didn't know there was a glitch. Hopefully others may get some drops from the queen so we'll know for sure.
---
Thank u
---
I only ever played the full version, but exploring the deep areas and just trying to not get killed was a lot of fun.
---
You convinced me. I'm officially a Gauss Rifleman again. 600+ dmg easy.
---
I had 9 turrets, 6 flamethrower, 6 tesla traps, 6 radiation traps, 3 small water going, 1 of every crafting station, a full bedroom, and a whole lot of wiring to make the trap room work, along with 40 plants.. and still wasn't max budget.
---
What's your excuse again?
---
Guess we can’t play together then😕
---
I thought about this before. 
---
There is a spot in the mire that would work For that as well. Kmax i think.
---
Only works in that region unless you activate the power station, Cause relay towers have no power.
---
Make it a thing you have to commit to earn, not something you can just do cause you want to.  
---
Moooorrree challange!
---
I really want a sausage extruder for my camp.
---
Oof I wish I read this an hour ago. I had some royal jelly and I accidentally made it into Royal Jelly jerky
---
You have changed my life with this post
---
14 sneak attacks in a row, no damage!
---
I've seen robots doing this at watoga I had to watch them as it was so funny.
---
Also junk, got bamboozled yesterday. Kind of my own fault tho, in a hurry bought what I thought was 10 Bulk steel at 20c each, turns out it wasnt bulked so I got 10 steel for 200 caps, good sell by whomever shop it was😂😂
---
This person didn't get it from the queen.  When you buy the high cap mod you learn it and also get the plan.  It's certainly a bug, expect it to be patched soon.
---
That's like comparing apples to oranges and saying, "Well, they're both fruit."
---
A few questions: 
---
Wireless or hardwired? 
---
Did you happen to change your Router settings? 
---
Any interference or multiple items on your wireless traffic wise? 
---
I’m hard wired in and I set up the router per Xbox and Bethesda recommendations. It’s pretty easy and I don’t have any issues on my side. 
---
You’ll still get random control server freezes but that’s the server side. 
---
Your router also may not have the console as a priority which you should be able to adjust. If other things are hitting it your router may not be able to handle the traffic. 
---
Could be as simple as your Ethernet cable... I had this issue once and it was night and day difference.
---
Backpacks are untradeable.
---
All the more reason to grind for it now, right!? Thanks for clarifying.
---
Also the easiest way for badges is to grind campfire tales
---
I can sell stuff straight from my pip not o.0
---
Probably a random event they had those if fallout 4
---
*their*
---
I haven’t played survival yet BUT I have most of the survivalist challenges already done except 2 of them.
---
I took a video
---
Handmade rifle is still the best gun in the game! Doesn't hold a candle to melee, but it's the most accurate in vats, the second best rifle and the best full auto!
---
But if you have the high capacity mod in inventory there's a glitch where I can make mine high capacity but not use the mod
---
Yeah 20 lbs is considerable!
---
Was really hopin refrigerator mod was a mini fridge.
---
They probably found another multiplayer game to cheat in there.
---
Oof, I had two bloodied auto grenade launchers disappear on separate occasions -- that sucks man
---
I've had an entire set of excavator power armor somehow duplicate itself a couple of weeks ago. Happened after patch 8.0 when the servers were super flakey one night. I died and there was no place for me to respawn on the entire map. My base and vault 76 were not options. Apparently this is an old bug.  I had to quit server and rejoin. After this, I noticed I had 2 sets.  Not sure how it happened, just that I died and could not respawn anywhere. So random dupes can and do  happen. 
---
I wouldn't expect BSG to ban me because of that unintentional dupe. True dupers will have 10+ copies of OP gear, not a single dupe instance of a vanilla PA or in my case a non-sellable PA (Atom Shop Skin) . I hope BSG has common sense not to ban people for their buggy servers duplicating things once in a while.  I scrapped the dupe as I don't need another set and I don't want to profit from a glitch.
---
Ummmm... cuz they are the best. My be laser has been and is still the best weapon in the game. Well at least till the nerf it after the dupe fest
---
No near the motel in mire and the free ranch
---
Go to harbours ferry lots of chems and stuff you can sell on I do this run daily.
---
IF you get it, don’t use it, sell it or drop it... you’ll need it later...lol
---
Main thing I remember is 2x fusion cores, other than that I’m not sure.
---
Unfortunately the spawn north of Vault 76 doesn't work, it's the junk version of Royal Jelly. I went there myself.
---
tried LAN and wifi, and i'm on PC. 
---
i even tried letting HD videos play on youtube in the background, they played fine. downloads are at max speed, just the game that won't log in.
---
disconnected router, everything.
---
but i'd like to know why beth changes my game into a different language when i hit "repair" lol
---
So I ask for proof it's a visual glitch and your response is "I don't have to prove anything,you do"?
---
That's hilarious.......
---
It’s only a waste if all you care about is money. However, if you actually ENJOY Fallout and immersing yourself in that world, 1200h is not wasted..it’s invested 😀👍
---
Just wait for the Atomic Shop 😊
---
There's lots of dupers again due to a new exploit. 
---
Hopefully they have this taken care of by Tuesday.
---
Leave server before nuke lands lol
---
Glad I’m not the only one this happened to.
---
I'm on pc and I got it at the top of the lighthouse first time.
---
Yes not too bad. I hate the way the game tracks the badge challenges.  Keep having to open the menu a million times
---
+karma thank you very much 👍
---
Huh?
---
To be fair, I made all 1400 daily caps yesterday by endlessly destroying piles of mole miners and just selling their shotguns, gauntlets, missile launchers and scrapped titanium.  I also sold so much out of my machine by having my camp between Blackwater Mine and Whitespring Station while a nuke was happening.  A variety of serums at 499 each, stimpaks at 10c each, bulked lead at 39c each and a free radshower was great.  I was over in Toxic Valley doing my weekly photo challenge, and it was hard to click back on my camp because there were so many dots over it.  I was happy mostly because my camp seemed to be a huge community benefit, and I wished I had limitless stims to sell.  I have three beds and a piano, and all were filled up the two times with AFKers when I came back to deposit more stimpaks and make more pre-packaged lead.  I started also selling .308, .45, 5mm and fusion cells for 1c each and could not keep them in stock.  My hotel is an actual hotel now, which is great.
---
I saw tons and tons of meat piles, so players were clearly cleaning up after themselves.
---
I guess it depends on where you put your camp.  If there's nearby enemies that have valuable loot, people will kill them for their own benefit.  If you have a couple mole rats that will endlessly harass your camp, it might be best to relocate.  Personally, I'd kill the mole rats and repair your broken walls without any idea of compensation, but I'm finding myself to be very generous when I see other players' selling prices.  My vending machine is more of a public service than a source of wealth.
---
I had my base on the lead extractor near prime, it was too far to launch artillery at the Queen.... Moved it since then, and only use the damn thing for fireworks displays!
---
I have played the game since beta and never once had server stability this bad. Call me EA, but I'm gonna say something is wrong on your side here.
---
if you were on xbox one id have one for ya
---
We can’t, currently, control where visitors spawn. They will spawn right where you initially set down the C.A.M.P. device. The owner will spawn near the current location of the device. There is no way to fix this until we get functional fast travel mats.

Rage 2 looks promising...way better than the original by the looks of it.  Releases on the 15 or 16th but definitely pickin that up.  Buddys been havin a blast with path of exile and its free on ps4.  Also just plated days gone and its one of my favs...so damn good
---
Every week there is a different 3\* weapon as a reward for doing a challenge in survival. This weeks reward was bugged and people have also been getting it in adventure mode.

---
Pshhh who needs logic.
---
Am i right lol. 
---
But i 100% agree
---
I mean it just seems odd that it’s happened about 7-8 times now repeatedly without it once having heavy spawns. I’ve definitely had more spawns at Mama Dolce’s with less people, there we’re 6 of us this on the recent attempt and I’ve had more solo in the past.
---
So far on PS4 I haven’t had any issues, I know that doesn’t help you though :/
---
Because these cats are the devil 😈 lol
---
Kinda funny how I suggest a game that I hear is fun and get downvoted... 
---
Guess they don’t know how to Reddit...🙄
---
Are you talking about [these 3?](https://i.imgur.com/lP3Tbnh.jpg) Because the guy pulled those spawns directly from the code for the game.
---
Btw , I was actually responding to joslato above ,not your statement.
---
hey - it's hope!
---
That’s a great idea. It’d be a ton of fun to try to build up a collection of songs!
---
Check upload speed to , iwe had problems with poor speed up while downspeed was great.
---
Yes!!
---
I don't have most of these issues on PS4. Sometimes if someone crashes and rejoin they need to leave the team and be reinvited, or sometimes it says people are in the main menu when they're in game and need to restart. Those are pretty annoying.
---
Check out watoga, has 7 potential magazine spawns that I know of. If you’re looking for a specific one, don’t pick up the others you see. You can server hop and check the spots again but they won’t generate in the spawn if you already grabbed one
---
The multiplayer is trash right now. The single player is one of the best games I've ever played. Totally worth it just for that.  I'm sure the multiplayer will get better eventually, but there just isn't anything to do in that mode.
---
Days gone looks soooo good graphic wise. Never heard of "path of exile" is it on PC? And I played the first rage. But wasn't really a fan . At the time there were other games with more going on. But thank you for reminding me about DG
---
my upload speed has always been shit, 1mb/s. but way more than enough to play this game.
---
Hey, I just wanna give a heads up on the Royal Jelly spawns. There's actually two versions of Royal Jelly with the same name and model - but one of them is a junk item that scraps for glass and antiseptic, and it can't be used for cooking. The spawn north of vault 76 is the junk version, so it's no good. Also, I'm not sure if your map accounts for this but there's two versions of Sugar Bombs, too - clean and dirty, the dirty version has rads and it's the version used in cooking recipes.
---
Oh.
---
It's the fan boys . Ignore them . Take my upvote
---
I'd love one that looks like the super mutant shopping trolley armor....
---
Got one myself ,love it so fast next to my death claw .
---
I had an anti-virus issue... check security settings. Also things that maybe set to run at start or updates. 
---
In some way something’s telling it to stop traffic or blocking it. 
---
How about safe mode with internet?
---
I saw someone stuck in my floor.
---
I even got a msg from someone else saying my house is broken.
---
 So i enter creative mode and deleted stairs and 1 floor.
---
Ended up deleting all then rebuild in the sky 
---
Xbox sidelingtexas74
---
That sucks . :( Ya the SP looks almost as good as GTA just another time period . How big is the world ? Compared to other games you e played
---
I found a furious crossbow the other day and have been furiously murdering critters since.
---
Yes, I went to all three and the one north of 76 is the wrong version of Royal Jelly. The mapping program must have caught it because it's still got the exact same name.
---
Top of the lighthouse got mine there mate.
---
Every time I see Death Blossoms, call my mates, open the map again and its gone. I want to give EVERYONE on the server corpse flower stamens just once please!
---
10/10
---
they will be moved into your stash, selling them from your pip boy requires a trade request. vending machine is stash items only
---
Not the answer of your question but I love to put my camp at near the small spawn points. Because everytime when I joined to server, I just loving to see my turrets while they are working.
---
At home, slot then into the jukebox, in workshop, share with the wasteland!
---
Does the rifleman perk affect the laser rifle?
---
I’m suggesting a limited number of songs that they’re able to get (just like the current collection played on Appalachia radio, but more of them). And then have players create a playlist/order for the radio. Also it’d be separate from the current radio so if you don’t like it, you don’t have to tune in, all of the current options would still be there. As far as getting sued, Bethesda managed to get the current library of songs (including Beach Boys), I’m sure they could figure it out.
---
NO!
---
I can fast travel to teammates camps without paying and I'm on PC.
---
Consoles crash too?! :)
---
I think they show up under drink, cause the only actual drink I'm selling is 100 purified water, and then some serums. But my game says I'm selling like 114 "drinks"
---
i usually check those before making a post on reddit or submitting a ticket. firewall and anti-virus are fine. 
---
what is safe mode with internet?
---
Meat piles did not work for me, and got some mid battle, but afterwards, meat piled were all that was left!
---
One is Heavy and the other one is normal.
---
one could be heavy and one could be light. both have different stats.
---
Interesting. Do they have shops? Do you see their health status too - specifically in the past 2-3 days?
---
Yup, it's a card. You'll need two of them, and to combine them. Once you have that, and you've got it enabled, you won't mutate, but you also won't LOSE mutations when you walk through the showers or drink radaway.
---
If you have a couple thousand caps it's even easier now with the player vending machines, I've seen lots and lots of people selling serums for 400 caps. You can pick exactly which mutations you want.
---
It tends to have more spawns with more people, if you're on your own it's mostly waiting
---
Wouldnt it state heavy though?  I thought it would.  But I suppose that could be
---
Man no mothman backpack!!??😔
---
Its pretty huge. It would take maybe 45 minutes irl to walk from one end to the other. If you like gta you would love this.
---
Man I keep getting different people tell me different spawns of the jelly are junk. It's super weird!
---
I think I'm gonna leave it for now and trust people to make their own judgement. Also hope that bgs will change it back to aid soon
---
50 days played
---
I agree :)
---
It does not, no, not on legendary items
---
My favorite one was the skin that has a Mr. Fuzzy doll on it. Someone said not all of the released images actually made it in the game though.  Really hope that one made the cut. Also hope it does end up in the atom shop instead of the quests. The scout quests are SOOOO boring.
---
I will power attack first sneak attack first even just reguallry attack and it wont do anything at all. As a high damage 2H user this is harsh when your up against alot of enemies ALONE. 
---
And your first hit matters Alot heck allof the hita do.
---
Thank you for showing this.
---
You stabilise flux (aka make it pure) by crafting 10 raw flux with:
---
+ Glowing mass
---
+ Hardened mass
---
+ High radiation fluids
---
All of these things are dropped by anything killed in a nuke zone
---
Oh ok, well that explains it thanks
---
Appreciated
---
Because it wouldn't be in MY power if i can complete them or not. Right now i can do all of them solo or with a friend. But i couldn't ask a broke friend to buy my stuff ,and it would honestly be silly for the whole vending system ,to have friends buying your wares ,when they're meant for everyone.
---
Just because you hoarded a lot of valuable items,it doesn't mean it's a common condition for everyone,and i'm not talking about newbs,they are meant to be behind in the challenges.
---
You'd have to skim the comments, he talked about them, those are supposed to be the right kind, maybe check again? Otherwise maybe go let him know? https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bmwpx9/mappalachia_my_project_which_can_automatically/
---
I have that with my low level character. Think it's a new bug from the patch.
---
Did you lose them or just not gain them??? /s
---
That sucks dude, sorry. I recently rolled a new character so I haven't tried selling yet. I can tell you the buying works as listed lol. Spent hundreds on plans.
---
Shout out to you guys selling starter plans cheaper than the vendors
---
still looking, working on that one and a few others
---
Wrong sub
---
You absolutely should not get in trouble for buying duped weapons, there's no way you can 100% know without the seller literally telling you.... Although I commented on several posts today asking about weather or not the weapon was duped and got a resounding yes both times, but the buyers carried on flocking in.
---
They could have you wander the wastes finding music holotapes, and you place them in your stash which those holotapes will be picked up by the terminal in the workshop, they could aquire licensing for other songs and pay for them with the atomic shop, but other players who may not have bought it off of the atomic shop could hear the song but only as long as the owner of the workshop wants to play it
---
MaKE aMerICa gREaT aGaiN!!
---
I was thinking of Wal-Mart
---
 Terminal to pick what to sell then you walk around and look at everything others have to sell
---
Fallout makes them tough &amp; huge.
---
If the person controlling it can use a mic to play DJ I would fight to the death to control it.
---
ah, i was server hopping to get a certain merchant to spawn at the Charleston station and one of the random encounters was just that
---
Yeah, after entering my map for the thousandth time in a row (which usually freezes or takes a few extra seconds to open anyway) I have determined the set up that they are using is not user friendly lol
---
im gonna start a group tomorrow on discord roleplaying the enclave on ps4, interested? would need discord.
---
Why would they invest that kind of money in to the game? Your idea is unrealistic.
---
Music licensing is a bitch all around and expensive. You're asking for that when Bethesda can't even get basic shit right.
---
Or just make it a perk that ranks up,it's stupid to have 3 individual cards for it.
---
Underrated
---
That will be an estate tax.
---
Yeah that's happened to me a bunch. It's kind of cool but then at times it's not cool cuz if it finishes loading you're stuck
---
Im begging im wrong, i never enjoyed camps in fo4 but am absolutely in love with them in fo76.
---
I use 90% of my playtime building 😅
---
Seriously, who only has speed demon? And emergency protocols on their power armor? Of those people, how many can also afford to get a bunch of speed demon serums. And who would spend those caps and that effort just to find out?
---
Answer, no one.
---
Give it a try yourself. Inform us.
---
No. You’re not the only one.
---
Only if they have better drop rates
---
That’s blatantly ignorant and antagonistic because someone is concerned someone is losing themselves to a video game. Going to assume you have a problem as well but you’re also just kind of rude and don’t care if someone has a problem so see ya
---
Im online all the time and run with some good folk.  Ill be on in a few hours helpin a buddy get his backpack if u wanna roll with.  Message me n ill shoot u my ID
---
Yup, I fixed a bunch and stashed em only to realize I cant do anything with them.
---
Add me and I'll gladly help in any way I can
---
Random events happen ? I saw fishing ,and I think hunting . Is there any building? Or can you purchase houses or properties?
---
yes. sucks.
---
Nothing a good bashing couldn't fix. Crossbows break easier when you use them like a club. ;)
---
Not an answer to the question but are we talking legit bans or were people autobanned that should not have been?
---
IT'S BLOODY RAW
---
no trading posts are allowed, it is rule 10
---
And my family will have to pay a fee to fast travel to my grave as well!
---
That I agree with.
---
I loved the rewards but the drop rates need to be achievable.
---
Sorry clicked wrong group deleting now
---
Serums are fairly cheap. Would make take 2-3k to find out. Maybe i'm gonna do that
---
They can't even take the minor task and add it to the map. It's just the ones that show the merit badge and how much is done on it. This is crazy. They need to expand on the items they have. They limit themselves. That's why we have the ideas and they have the resources.
---
&gt;I’ll go one further, due to copyright stuff songs outside the game wouldn’t be able to be played, but due to a lack of djs in the game what if we could be djs? It would require a mic obviously but you could press a stop button on the music and talk about whatever into the radio, then turn the music back on
---
People could pay you to advertise their shops in between songs.
---
"Come on down to crazy Nate's house of random shit! Conveniently located on highway 62, just south of Cevasse Dam. Open 10 to 8 on weekdays, noon to 6 on weekends. Now *you've* got a friend in the murdering business!"
---
"and now, by request, here's *Country Roads*, performed by someone who isn't John Denver."
---
Right? Whats the point. Are people that havent done the quest getting them in containers as well?
---
Ya, there is tons of content.  Probably the easiest thing is to check out a few youtube vids
---
I bid a comrade chubs, two slightly chewed Chew sticks, Gronak #9 and the left over of a Nuka Cola? Deal?
---
Umm you can?  In the Tinkers bench.

---
Path of exile is on ps4 and haven’t played it but i can vouch for my friend an if he says its good, it at the least aint bad lol
---
Idk anymore. Got banned in Jan. Was told it was temp. Been 4 months.iv considered it a perm at this point and given up trying to get back in.
---
I noticed this on the first day if the beta. It was perfectly fine in fallout 4 and now its just so awful that i dislike using melee now.
---
Not loose screws.  Springs.  Yes.  Gears yes.  Not screws.
---
Not to talk bad about morgantown airport...but shes turned into a real slut
---
I use a EU version for my 2nd account. Works same as my north american main in Canada, was 15 USD on a key site
---
yea im baffled how the other sources of endurance dont give the hp boosts.
---
More then likely gamestop
---
If someone spends less time playing a video game than the average work day, how the fuck is that "ignorant and antagonistic"? It isn't rude to point out the obvious, some people have more spare time, and you are rude by judging them without a fucking clue about their life.
---
It's hilarious and sad how often players in this subReddit will judge others, and I personally think you should be ashamed of yourself considering you know nothing about them.
---
I got it for less than $30 at a GameStop. I’d suggest a game shop like that.
---
The bans arent automated, flagging your account for investigation might be.  
---
&gt; Everyone who *was banned for* duplicated items did so by clearly exploiting issues in the game.
---
Better?
---
Gottem
---
They do this weekly, the requirements change for each weapon. Often these requirements can be prepared for in adventure mode and then accomplished in survival in a few minutes but this last one was glitches and could be done in adventure. I hope Bethesda doesn't take my veteran away, I would've gladly done it survival but I had kill a human like creature done before I realized it.
---
Buy it from someone who has it and says they don’t like it.
---
Bought some on the weekend from some guys for 10 caps, more the next day for 100 each. 100 is the marketplace norm.
---
So a that guys response to this below is a bit too  conspiratorial for me but I did like a couple of things he said
---
Conspiracy: don't really know what "retributions" comedians and reporters face without a lawyer when one of our amendments specifically allows freedom of speech
---
Agree: yeah nearly everybody I know doesn't own or really care to own a gun. Only people who own any that I know are police or somebody like my grandfather who is ex-military
---
Where should I look to find someone like that?
---
I live in Indiana and here we have a place called disc replay where people bring in games the don’t want anymore (and sometimes I think the store just buys them instead of getting them from actual people) and I’m sure it’s really cheap now there. 
---
Maybe you have one of those in your state?
---
Yeah but they are like 10000 caps which is way overpriced unless they changed it
---
The middle section at Top of the World would be perfect
---
I’d have to suggest Facebook, Craigslist or some other site you can find someone selling things. Maybe even eBay? Obviously someone you know in person would be your best bet in that situation considering in-person requests are much more effective
---
Thanks! I’ll have a look.
---
Why do you want to bulk them? It just wastes plastic.
---
Vanguard. Take healing factor mutation or keep stimpacks up and keep your rads down. Yes the vanguard armor loses its buff once your health drops but with healing factor you regen right after battle so the next encounter you are a tank to start. Once you get used to it you learn to use sneak attacks to eliminate the first few guys and tank the rest. I normally run vanguard but switch to bloodied when I feel like 1 shotting things, my armor just really suffers there.
---
I do leave vendors near the vault area alone cause that's where noobs are. If you can make it to my shop you have money.
---
I've definitely gotten credit for flicking meat piles.  The camera is really fussy, so you sometimes have to get in exactly the right spot for the corpse (or live beast) to count.
---
I mean... [this is my collection of truly Steiglitz-esque masterworks](https://imgur.com/a/IXwry7s) that netted me the 10 images in the Bog.  Clearly I'm very talented.  All I did was move around a lot to get enemy names to show up in the upper right of my frame without regard to what the image shows.  That second, very obvious, pic of the SBQ didn't count her picture, but it did for an ant/radscorpion/angler/bloatfly/bloodbug.  Go figure.  I think one of the middle photos, where she was clearly not in the center of the frame was what gave me credit for an SBQ photo.
---
Yo best of luck on your recovery bro
---
Have a weapon with a recon scope or the pearly peepers from the imposter SS quest line.  
---
They jsut have to scan a lot of animals nearby which gives a single rare plan.
---
To give you an idea I'm over 500 on both DR and ER when at full health. Power armor numbers without the power armor.
---
Them forcing the feature like they have, has made me hate it. Especially as I still use Photomode for screenshots I actually want.
---
Awesome thanks
---
You’re forgetting about taxes!
---
Holy crap that’s cool! Yeah when the game first came out it was $44 I think so must be really cheap now
---
I’m hoping it will!
---
thx
---
Probably to do with struggling to find the right meat pile, or them despawning.
---
Likewise with Jangles! Who wouldn't pay entirely too much for a Jangles the Moon Monkey? It doesn't even need to contain actual fiberglass...
---
Yeah same here. Let me guess, Watoga and Nukashine?
---
So long as you got credit for the kill, the meat pile will persist until you loot it (or DC or fail to loot it for x amt of time after leaving the cell).  Document the grossness first, then grab your stuff.
---
You use to be able to give them to other players - as I had given mine to my son to take son photos 
---
I dont know why they changed it now so you cant - just seems stingy
---
Yeah the range sucks hard right now
---
Yup - me too. Damn Yao Guai...
---
Can you play on NA with one? I have a couple friends I'd like to play with.
---
I price deep pocketed lower. 300 or 400, depending on the type, but I might be leaving money on the table. I don’t know. You can buy mine and resell higher.
---
I am pretty close to the Vault! Thank you. :]
---
I finished Archer, Hunter and Athlete. I spent hours server hopping in hopes of finding royal jelly for the Cook challenge. I don't know if is a daily world spawn or a daily player spawn, but I never found a third. When I get royal jelly from honey beast or the corpse in the forest it shows as junk and not an aid item or ingredient.
---
I'm glad it was a challenge to get a backpack. I think the bugs or major gripes might get a fix with the Purveyor update on the 16th.
---
they would not do that, due to "abuse" unless it is a stash box
---
I can build you some for now, if your ps4. I need to repair 3 crossbows for my badge.
---
Sometimes meat piles get stuck in perpetual loading inventory.
---
Ta
---
Take some screenshots and report them.
---
Meh I wouldn’t worry too much about the screws..once you start having to repair your armour the number will go down very quickly.
---
yeah me and my team have been doing that
---
I need one in my life!! And a mothman plushie too
---
I honestly can’t imagine having enough for it to be a concern.
---
But...but...but... ‘murica
---
I wonder if it's just so they can give you the bucket list quest in a believable way instead of just having it pop up when you receive the camera since you get that list to go with it. I'm sure someone could come up with a clever way to still make it work, like maybe get a travel brochure with the same locations dumped into your inventory whenever you get a camera or something
---
I certainly agree with you though
---
Your mom must be having the best mother's day. I'm proud of you and I don't even know you.
---
It makes more sense now. Before there were way too many ways to get into that building in a post apocalyptic setting.
---
It was such a fun event with so much little things to do- I really hope for more content like that too
---
Got proof?
---
Go to your pipboy then hit T.
---
Also, killing things by bashing them with the crossbow counts towards the kill 50 enemies part as well.
---
Network sorry... 
---
Windows 10, F8 key should bring up options to start in safe mode with networking
---
Or 
---
Press Windows logo key + I on your keyboard to open Settings. ...
---
Select Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery.
---
Under Advanced startup, select Restart now.
---
After your PC restarts to the Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart.
---
After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options.
---
I’m not too big into gaming merchandise but I’d throw money at this one!
---
You're not completely exiting the game, so you don't have to load the whole engine first.  It takes you back to the main menu without fumbling through the L1 menu.  It's really just fewer button presses for the most part, but you can get to the Social menu and your own name really fast.  It's also good for getting yourself out of hot water as long as you're not right on top of a guaranteed spawn, at the expense of leaving the server (and your team, if applicable.)
---
Yeah it's better to not have anything to do and just kill ghouls at whitespring.....true,true.
---
Yeah, you almost have to stand on the edge of the helipad. The distance that the camera can identify objects is ridiculously short. The 105mm lens doesn’t extend it either.
---
True, but i’m level 80 and i’ve never experienced this small amount - it’s literally spawning 1-3 enemies for every event and that’s it
---
I only found it when I read the tiiiiiny tiny text on the pop-up from a team invite.  And even then, I found the Leave Server option completely by accident.
---
The campfire one kinda feels like it. But it doesn’t pop up nearly enough and I don’t like server hoping for events
---
The barrel determines the effect, it'll use that blank ammo to produce the desired effect.
---
Edit: I just read the rest of your post. I use endangerol all the time. What effect to expect it to have? It weakens the target, it doesn't cause any significant damage.
---
True....i had 8 and it wasn't effective enough to bring down a "Bugged" stationary lol 50 mirelurk queen......which I can one shot with my tse dragon
---
Then why doesn’t it register on the badge when I shoot stuff?  I don’t think it’s bugged because people seem to have gotten it before 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Yes, it's called Tactical paint if I'm correct.
---
Saved for later.thx
---
Would be along long time until that with all the problems they gotta fix atm mate. Definitely sounds like a good idea but would be ages if they do end up doing it.
---
Thanks. This will save a few people looking
---
I use both at the same time from the same IP address in Canada how I transfer stuff
---
If this guy plays Country Roads one more time, I’m gonna...
---
THAT’S IT, DIE, MAMAJAMA!!
---
I cry lol
---
Yeah, the tab switching is really only necessary if you've scrolled down the Recent list for anything
---
Yes he had a shop. Didn't notice about health.
---
Path of exile is on PC. It is similar to diablo2.  I put  about 1k hours into it
---
Damn three different answers lol, thank you for explaining
---
You might be confused my main account is North American I have a second account that is European that I bring it on to the North American servers
---
Yeah
---
Does it also work with heavy then?
---
Showing concern for someone’s mental well being is not shaming them. Ignorant.
---
IMO 10mm smg &gt; normal smg. Ive just started calling the normal smg a tommy gun cuz smg sounds too vague.
---
Only those besides atom shop
---
A crossbow usually spawns at the archery area of the Palace of the Winding Path. Even has some crossbow bolts too!
---
Oh, I hadn't played in so long and only recently came back. I know one of my mutations effects my hunger/thirst a little but I couldn't remember it being like this. I thought I was just misremembering. :(  They drain really, really fast.
---
Ahhh I guess I can go find a ushanka and tankie consplay that would be fun
---
I'm in the UK so we actually have it on a completely different date! But thank you nonetheless :)
---
Oh
---
I just got that one today! It was super fun.
---
That's what I always did with it until now
---
Another one that is back is the one where if u had two guns of the same type it doesnt save them on reload to favs. Annoying me so much.
---
hmmm that might actually be a better idea then id have a better chance at giving free stuff to players who would actually use them.
---
Same, wasn’t even really trying.
---
I’ll meet you.
---
My IGN is the same as here without the underscore.
---
It's 75% per piece. So you need all five pieces to proc in order to get the 40% reduction / full sentinel effect. There's a only 23.7% chance of all pieces activating.
---
ha ha awesome 😂
---
No I'm not saying that... just saying that nothing has really been added to the game to improve it... just chores been added to make it seem there is more to do.. trust me I want more to do desperately.. but this isn't it
---
Damn i usually eat them. Guess healing is more efficient.
---
It really is. Got tired of the bullet and cap sink of sbq/imposter so it’s a nice change
---
You can add me, Reddit and psn are the same names. I’ll run a silo with you this week, Tuesday and Wednesday are my free days.
---
I was able to complete that badge but my weekly Bog Photos stopped registering at 6/10 for some reason.   First off, make sure you’re using the Prosnap camera and not the photomode, sounds like you’re using the right one though.   Make sure the animals name appears in the top right. 
---
I read a post saying if you fill all your photo spaces but keep taking pictures it counts for the challenge.  I tried this yesterday and it didn’t fix my Bog photos but maybe it’ll work for you.   You can delete the crappy photos after you’re done.  I’m on PS4 btw.
---
Well, I think I might be done with the game.  Not because of this alone, but it's one of 1,000 cuts that has been steadily driving me away from game and making me not want to play it.  The latest DLC (ever upwards) was really off putting to me as well. It's just more grinding away on the endless loot treadmill collecting badges and trying to get backpacks.  The grind for better loot is now ***the defining feature*** of this game and I have grown to despise it.   Yeah yeah all MMO type games are like that, you will say.  But like many others, I am not an MMO fan  and have not played a single one until now. I played it because am a Fallout fan who was hoping for the best, but instead had all of my worst fears confirmed.

Buy plans using 3* hard bargain and grape mentats if you’re getting close and you have more selling that will take you over.
---
If you go over you lose those caps!
---
True, and that's especially useful if you want to return to a specific server on an alt character, as long as that friend hasn't hopped.
---
It's fine if peeps wanna resell my shit, but it would really be nice if the player that got them actually needed it.  Juan gave me a good idea, leave vendor near the vault so there'll be a higher chance that a noobie will get to it.
---
Yeah, you don't have to switch tabs or anything, just go up, as long as you haven't scrolled down to find someone's name to accept a team invite or anything like that.
---
Just the High Capacity mod at the moment
---
I know right?
---
I had 500+ before vending came around
---
I post things at the default rate. Except for unusual items like faschnach (sp?) Masks.  I collected all I could at the event just to be able to sell them to other players.
---
No idea what I could get, but I ask for 500.
---
Lots of peeps doing this! Makes the wasteland a better place!
---
Little workaround I've found is using the stock and barrel that reduce recoil, thing becomes a beast then, and you're able to land 5-7 headshots in a row
---
I'm at least glad to see I'm not going crazy lol.
---
I'm still having this problem to this day, Every time I log in and try this mission they simple aren't there. This is a joke of a game.
---
thank you for assuming I said boy lol.
---
I’m on PS4 and have gotten the knife plans three days so far.   The big parts have given me mounted bugs so far.
---
Oh hell, I got stuck between two foundations yesterday!  I couldn't do a damn thing.  LOL
---
First time I’ve seen someone do this lol only thing I’ve seen people do is put lewd stuff on the new vending machines -.-
---
Its the ghouls sliding prone around Whitespring that are annoying me.
---
Though there is a mod for this for PC, I really don't see how an equivalent couldn't be created by the devs for Console using the left D-Pad for assignments and just saving the profiles on the very xbox/playstation that's using it. Even if they could only allow say 4 profiles at the most that would still be a great QoL change for the game.
---
If they're not going to do this then I would hope they go with the "Suggestion" to make the crafting and some utility perk cards fully passive after you've gotten them.
---
It just really bogs the game down having to stop fairly often to switch between all the different perks for fighting, gathering, and crafting in and out of our builds.
---
Can you build the tics or the molerats?
---
Hey bud I’m on now let me know if ur still interested!
---
Happy to see people are getting some use out of the list! :D 
---
The challenges should definitely be in their own category, I agree with /u/Sinistas; even with the checklist open my other screen, it's still frustrating to not know the specifics of how many things I need to kill or craft unless I navigate through multiple menus to check. It's especially frustrating to me because I don't have a scrollwheel. Lots of button-pressing to find what I need to find. Hopefully Bethesda sees this post and makes some changes.

That's the bootleg bar under the tattoo joint in Morgantown.
---
I haven’t seen any of those yet! But I’ve seen a few pretty great poster re-writes now. Little things like that make the game for me. (And it’s fun to see players keeping that twisted Fallout sense of humor alive.) 😊
---
You’re doing the lord’s work.
---
Thank you for the help!!!! I have gotten some of the stuff, however need to lvl to max and get my great guns before taking these on by myself!
