Just look at the bootlickers in these comments. This shits already forgotten and forgiven. I say let them get fucked. I hope Bethesda keeps charging and charging and charging for nothing, anyone buying it deserves it

---
Again the scrapbox is a bonus of subscribing you still have access to the scrapbox after the subscription ends. And if you didn't know it literally only holds scrap no junk and no bulk scrap. it becomes 1 line and takes up no extra resources on the server side for an object.   
---

---
So your argument is currently moot.
---
Who lied? I don't recall Bethesda ever saying this, just players.
---
Even sea of thieves is offering free private servers so communities can role play and hold events
---
*sheepishly raises hand* Thought it would be interesting to try for a month and was a decent deal on Atoms (first time purchase) with some neat little goodies and the chance to try private servers. So far I haven't been met with aggressive behavior.
---
random statistics lmao
---
Dont see how I'm getting fucked or how I'm against video games? I'm paying 100$ to play this with the Sub. What's going to happen? I lose 100$ and I say I enjoyed playing it atleast.
---
I can link you to a few if you want, just had another person say "I've never played this game and with the way they're treating franchise fans I never intend to" lol so there's definitely astroturfers here, can't deny that one
---
They're very tricky to find after you finish the An Organic Solution quest. Strangler blooms seem to only spawn when the Heart of the Swamp public event is active. If you don't wanna wait for the event then the best way to find them is probably to server-hop Dryer Chemical until you finally find them. Make sure you do not pick Strangler PODS, that's what they're called before blooming. They'll glow when they've turned into blooms.
---
COMMUNIST ENRAGED!
---
So what you're saying is that it's okay to pay greedy corporations if they're forcing you to, but if you pay them because you legitimately enjoy their product, you're an asshole. Right. Makes so much sense.
---
I avoid that cringe in the initial post and then you rick roll me like that hahaha
---
I noticed this as well after checking in multiple servers as I am out of radshield now and need to make more.
---
#BRO#
---
Meh, is that really the best you can do? I already subscribed, and am happy with the service. 
---
Let me ask you, what kind of loser comes into a sub for a game they don't play, to whine about it?
---
THIS is exactly why I love the Fallout community!! 
---
This is awesome!!
---
So you'll be refraining from all non-essential spending for the rest of your life then? Because fun fact: corporations don't care about people.
---
Honestly I'm surprised there's even a community left after how much Bethesda has repeatedly shown how little they think of their fanbase.
---
Deserved salt.
---
That was a fun night man... I'm assuming you watched the Lorespade videos?  Good man
---
Didn't say that made them assholes. But sure we'll go with your narrative
---
Yes I do, send me an add and a msg to remind me please, and I’ll just look when I’m on
---
Yeah someone said it yesterday (trying to find that convo but can’t now) and I thought “What? I don’t remember that.” But I gave them benefit of the doubt.  Now I’m asking for people to cite stuff for all the broken promises.
---
No one has been messing with me
---
If you think the devs are the enemy then why do you continue to support their actions?
---
Well, shit...if it's funny then they should just fill the Atom Shop with more broken but funny things.  Because when they work, we can all laugh.
---
Wish a motha would try to grief me.... I’ll go to my private world so fast and farm an unlimited amount of scrap... get fucked nerds.
---
Yeah, they came up in my YouTube feed. I'm on PC, so wont be hunting my own personal smackdown, but it looked like a lot of fun.
---
That quest never works for me. I go there with the Quest and Boomer never does the dialogue to let me progress. He keeps repeating that he's damaged and doesn't acknowledge that I'm right there to take his place.
---
Thanks.  All the filming and editing was done by the Fallout Five-0 RP community.
---
"A World of Pain" is the mod you need.
---
Hundreds of new locations are added or modified. 
---
But, it is brutal. Extremely brutal. You will die, you will quit in frustration, but you'll be back, trying to find out what's inside all those new hidey-holes. 
---
Pro-tip: Throw a grenade in, see what comes out first, then decide if you're going to shoot it out or run like a little girl.
---
On the other hand, theres plenty lurkers or nonreddit ppl who are as upset as those who went vocal. Keep that in mind. Enjoy your game.
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED ON THE FALLOUT REDDIT!
---
ENGAGING MARKETING PROTOCOLS
---
COMMUNISM IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF FAILURE!
---
EMBRACE SUBSCRIPTIONS OR*YOU*WILL*BE ERADICATED
---
I'd imagine you only milk the most out of it by keeping on the move for legendaries, and hitting up all the unique spawns for outfits, magazines, and events like the responders vendor bot.  No other players picking them up before you unless you're playing with buddies.  No worrying about tapping legendaries in events because they're only there for you.  :) 
---
It's not my cup of tea, but I hope you enjoy farming private servers.
---
Good luck having such a mod approved when you can pass with the same character between Privates and Adventure.
---
this gun is absolute trash only good on headshots and having ironsights well....
---
The amount of people who think the Fallout 1st subscription is worth $100 is really sad.
---
Both.
---
I don't think so. I think they're just under the quest section because they use the quest item 'inert bomb' that you pick up during the daily as a crafting component.
---
What are you talking about? Mainstream media don't fake news on purpose -- they might make mistakes occasionally, but they are not out to mislead.
---
I have, directly. 
---
You weren't lied to, you're missing no content by skipping the subscription. I guess you missed that bit when you kneejerked into the victim role.
---
I have no clue how else you want me to lay this out for you.
---
Seems like a bit of advantage...maybe raise scrip limit for Fallout 1st members too, poor things can't even hold all those legendaries.
---
Sorry haha.  Just had to.  we spent a lot of time making that so I’m trying to get it out there haha
---
Wut lol. You obviously have not been around for very long. People asked for a patch adding a scrap box like this because as it turns out many gammers are good at programming. They literally said this could not be done. You are trying to say it's ok to lie then charge consumers for their own ideas on how to fix the busted base game? You also completely ignored how this is a tactic taken straight out of Korean MMOs which has never been accepted in the west.
---
Just ask
---
If they did, I'd be kinda miffed about them watering down my Survival difficulty without letting people opt in.
---
For all the negative reactions here I see that alot of people did buy it. Play a match of nuclear winter and listen and see how many people have the emotes and gear.
---
No real modding will be possible until Private servers are sealed away from Adventure. Otherwise here will be premium users going to their private world, magically conjurng everything they want with their console commands on holotape, go back to adventure to profit.
---
That's *really* unbalanced. Premiums would basically be legalized cheaters.
---
Griefing is profoundly uncool. Yet this image is quite funny.

You get it by talking to the robot Boomer at the Southern Belle Motel.
---
/thread
---
I always thought it was paid, I had asked for clarification from Pete Hines on twitter last year about what he meant about the private servers and whether we could host our own or if it's through them.
---
He said,
---
&gt; if you want private servers, it would have to be through us
---
While it wasn't exactly specific about it's price, I just never considered it could have been taken as free.
---
What does it mean to "win" in Fallout?
---
Yeah I don’t agree with the other person, it’s definitely an apt comparison
---
Yup, got my Bloodied build last week. Big F to my 2 steel scrap and unstoppables bird game
---
People just need to stop collecting everything in sight and only collect what they need for making ammo/repairing equipment. Some like myself collect the most popular junk to sell in my player vending for easy caps and leave the crap junk alone/drop it.
---
I don’t know what’s worse, A) People thinking they’re special and that their worthless opinions really matter to anyone other than themselves, or B) Grown men (and women) crying about a fucking video game. The world doesn’t owe you anything, your opinion doesn’t matter, crying won’t get you anywhere, none of this matters, we’re all going to die and turn into dust, play it or don’t. Welcome to reality. Sorry, but it’s not all about you and how something makes you “feel” or whether or not it “upsets” you. The sooner they learn that the better.
---
Nice suggestion. Bethesda will likely charge you $10 for it.
---
I am not Korean nor follow their games or antics, you assume I would know. Next at what point did they explicitly say that a scrap box was not possible?  Please point that out exactly you have it written out. I came with quotes over what has been an explosive patch week and you have come with words without meaning.   
---
Oh yes I was around for the whole stash is to small bit but I never saw a programmer say hey why not do a second box for only scrap and have bethesda say nope not possible.   
---
As it stands you have taken many things and tried to turn it into a bastardized version to your liking as you provided no context nor sources for what you have said.
---
Now that you mention it, I remember him saying that. And yeah based on that a solid assumption is that it would be a paid service, or somehow curated? But almost certainly paid. I just tossed the curated idea to have a *possible* alternative, not likely, and now untrue, but possible.
---
Already shared it and I see many great compliments especially about the Fallout community! 
---
This is what makes it a great one!
---
lol I'm pretty big into trading and got tired of having to juggle my stash, so I bought some weapon weight reduction armor so everything is less than a pound and carry it with me. Even helps me make extra sales because people see something they like while requesting another they decided on. Haven't even farmed legendaries on a private server yet my guy lol
---
Waiting till the storm is over, if they say anything it'll probably only worsen the situation.
---
Go then, its where you belong if you paid them any money for this shit.
---
Bang!
---
I've played 200+ hours, am I allowed to complain about bgs continuing to add paywalls yet, or do you require I put in a few hundred more hours before I'm allowed to make up my mind?
---
QQ
---
No, they shouldn't, no matter how much of a steaming pile of cow shit this subscription is.
---
Lol. You certainly have an active imagination.
---
Youre actively ignoring Wastelanders. If that's awful, then yes I'll be more on the wtf Bethesda. But this is the current reality of the gaming industry, and Beth is doing no worse than what's already been accepted by the gaming industry. In a number of ways they're doing better, broken patches not so much. But again, this is dependent on Wastelanders and going forward.  
---
It's not ideal, I'd like more socialism and egalitarianism, and less capitalism in my games, but that's not the current standard practices of the industry  Beth isn't bending the knee to a country committing genocide like blizz, and they haven't attempted p2w profession like in battlefront 2. I don't see any reprehensible gambling either. 
---
If they released this along with a polished Wastelanders, most people wouldn't bat an eye. But they one: released a two tier sub fee, and they released this without solid content updates. 
---
They also found a way to allow unlimited scrap. How? I'm not sure.
---
Ha!  Happily uninstalled afterwards.  Mine was doing a nuke run, only my second in 1020 hours of gameplay JUST to be able to nuke my own camp with my friend who I had launched my FIRST nuke with.  Classic.
---
Ta ta Bethesda.  Hopefully you’ll figure things out prior to releasing Fallout 5.  Or..sell the franchise back to Obsidian.  You know...
---
Their messaging definitely could've been clearer.  Hell...their messaging ain't the only thing that went awry with this game and I imagine we all know that.
---
Yes, you do deserve to be salty for the idea that others are bad for buying extra content to enjoy.
---
I looked up the Quakecon interview and at best they said private servers and moddable. I couldn't find about it being paid or not. With the lack of them saying paid service at the time people probably assumed free again from the 1st Hines quote I put.   
---
I would be interested if you have a direct link or tell me the site where they mentioned paid.
---
Respect as well for the civility.  But ***strongly*** disagree with your closing point.  You're absolutely allowed to spend your money how you want.  But when your spending habits screw someone else over, it's completely reasonable for them to be annoyed about it.  Saying they're "a ridiculous child and need to grow up" when you're screwing them over is beyond absurd.  Just as you're allowed to spend your money, people are allowed to be annoyed when you spend your money in a way that worsens their lives (even in a relatively minor way).  If you drive in a traffic-legal but kinda dickish way that screws someone over, they're not a child for getting annoyed about it.  There're definitely childish ways to express that grievance, but just having it and saying so is completely legitimate.
---
I don't call you a "ridiculous child who needs to grow up" for your spending habits, even if they make me cringe.  Similarly, you probably shouldn't say that about people who dislike being directly screwed over by your spending habits.  Their point is completely valid and there's no reason they shouldn't express it in a public venue about this exact topic, even if hearing it makes you cringe.
---
Thats awesome I'll get some PVP maybe I'll buy a month lok
---
Why are Fallout 1st players in adventure mode? Silly kids go play in your own private server lol.
---
People enjoying and supporting stuff that you don't like is ALSO as old as capitalism itself.
---
This is the ghouls trying to overrun Tenpenny Tower.
---
I heard it sucks ass. Floaty combat,  bad graphics, universal ammo, linear worlds, uninspired dialogue, and horrible controls.
---
Can I ask where you shared it? Just so I can share it with the rest of the Fallout Five-0 community.
---
That was me. I wanted the Halloween stuff and wanted to see what the fuss was about. It's more fun in some ways, less fun in others, and I'm not going to go all-in with a sub of any kind because it's not ultimately worth the money.
---
&gt;I'd rather just message them and explain how much they're hurting the franchise, as well as future entries in Bethesda franchises. Paying for such an awful subscription gives Bethesda free reign to do it again in future games.
---
Point A: If there's anything I've learned from this subreddit, it's that there's nothing you can tell them that will make them finally see what a steaming pile of crap this all is.
---
&gt;You already paid for the subscription so you're used to abuse anyway.
---
See point A.
---
Yeah the GOVT here is introducing a higher tax every year as a means to price cigarettes out of peoples lives to prevent smoking. 
---
This Fallout post has taken a weird turn.
---
Yes i went on private, but i do have a large friends list and so do my friends, that could be the reason.
---
Generic 70's nerd kid with the glasses: AWW, shiet here we go again, worst toxic players on the world...
---
With the exchange rate and taxes it’s no where near as low as 8 USD over here...
---
👍
---
Holy cow, just lurked the post history of one of our fav private server salters and wow, just wow. Post history is an amazing thing
---
&gt;They deliberately shut down several private servers that were doing  absolutely fine, just so they could release their own version to pull in  more subscribers.
---
False. Open vanilla private servers have existed since around 2008, blizzard had refused the idea of official vanilla servers all the way up until early 2017. Prior to them even remotely considering vanilla they had already taken down multiple private servers of completely older versions including vanilla servers.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Fun fact as well is that WoW server emulation, aka the software to host private servers, had existed even when WoW vanilla was literally in the beta phase.
---
&gt;The only reason WoW classic exists is greed.
---
WoW classic is a game aimed to be as close as possible to vanilla as it were in 2006 and had said specifically  they do not plan to add in new content, there is no extra passion required to release the game how it was already, i was referring to vanilla as it were in 2004, the game had been clearly made with passion, most of the dev team at the time were hardcore everquest players seeking out a much more streamlined, and polished MMO, the dev team consisted of **actual game consumers**, not just passionless programmers doing what they are forced to do to make a living (which for the record i'm not implying is immoral).
---
First off, I see no reason to receive a snarky comment from you via IM.  I did not IM you.  I put a reply in the forums.  Therefore, I will be blocking you after this reply.  As for roleplay, I did not sign on to roleplay an inventory logistics coordinator who needs to be a master chef and dietician.  I spend at least a third of my time playing, if not more micromanaging food, drink and inventory.  I prefer to roleplay the guy trying to survive in a hostile world after a nuclear war by scouting around, defeating "evil", improving my armor and weapons... That sort of thing.  I eat 2, maybe 3 times a day in real life.  Even taking into consideration having to do combat, I don't see having to eat every 10 minutes as being realistic.  It's punishment and over the top.  You are obviously entitled to your snarky opinion.
---
I have tried waiting waiting for Heart of the Swamp and they still do not bloom. I have server hopped Dyer Chemical at least 20 times and even moved my camp near by. Still nothing.
---
Still, that’s sort of an impractical solution when you’re paying for an extra service and how it’s marketed.
---
They probably would.  Still, it would be more convenient that you don't need to keep fast travelling to your workshops to get the generated steel, lead, acid, ammo, etc.  Just seeing someone's customized travelling caravan bot would make the world feel less empty.
---
Im leval 16 and my entire base got blown up because i decided to pay 13 more dollars on this game F U guy
---
Same situation. It is quite frustrating.
---
That stinks. Sorry to hear that.
---
I like to think Those two probably knew about what was going to be dropped on the community soon.
---
And I bet the entire time they were thinking to themselves "Oh fuck. This is going to end bad. Do they not know how people will react? People were being mostly positive for fucks sake".
---
They will release it next patch. For $$$ ofc.
---
I always check people’s misc section when trading. Don’t buy them for more then 100Caps each.
---
Exactly that’s my thoughts on it. Private Servers? Cool I can join someone else’s if I’m cool with them or I can play Adventure like the base game is literally made for (don’t give me the private servers have less lag excuse because they don’t I have 1st), Scrapbox? Cool idea but I’ve heard people are losing all their junk &amp; I honestly don’t need the space for junk I still have 200lb’s of free space on one character &amp; 100 on the other in my stash plus I can make a mule used for carrying junk &amp; crap so I’m good. Ranger outfit? Yeah it looks good but there are free outfits that look cool too just super rare. &amp; everyone can buy atoms for real money so shouldn’t be upset people get free atoms with it. A game like this with the plans BGS have needs a subscription. I think the way they just announced it in the patch notes during maintenance like it was nothing was a big mistake but I dont mind the service in anyway. ESO has done it a long time &amp; it’s actually a really enjoyable game if you’re as into the Elder Scrolls as Fallout.
---
The mod that gives me the quality of life changes that should have been part of the base game for free.
---
Oh boy when you say "business" all goes down the country roads.
---
But hey I love the game. And you?
---
HEY I SAID THE GAME DON'T YOU SAY BETHESDA
---
Lol. Do you need me to apologize for having disposable income and wanting the NV armor? Will that make you feel better? If so, I'm sorry.
---
Hey dumb dumb. Dunno if you got my message. Im online now. Come attack me.
---
I guess for a good comparison, one month of Fallout 1st here in NZ is the equivalent to the price of three months Xbox live gold subscription.
---
If my.point of view is that, I don't have a problem, that's my opinion &amp; I have the right to say it. I'm not spreading hate or having a go at people who are having fun. I'm just sick of the people who aren't happy trying to put everyone else down.
---
Yes I'm still supporting the game, that's because I still enjoy it.
---
If your unhappy with Bethesda, send them emails, ring them. Just don't take your frustration out on people who are just here to play a game they like. Make the hate mean something- start an online petition or something &amp; get all those that agree to sign it, if you get enough, try to get a YouTuber on your side. One that actually reports the truth. If you do this the right way, things will change. If you just hate because I don't share your view, it won't help you get what you want, so why do it?
---
I wish I could actually group up at times.  I spend most of my time soloing because there is no one anywhere near the content I'm working on.  Even when they are, they act like I'm not even there.
---
If the modes are that tyrannical then so be it. It would fit for a FO76 sub.
---
No, it's not at all like that. The amount of fallacies and reductionist thinking in this sub (and among gamers and general) is astounding.
---
Check out Path of Exile business model.
---
I haven't encountered it, but my friend has. He made a ticket and they gave him back more than he lost. I'm actually hoping it happens to me lol.
---
Idk I really liked it.
---
Hey who wants to party at my CAMP? 
---
Now let's see all the hate comments... (takes popcorn)
---
They also took away my cooking emote from last year and I cant get it back.
---
It needs to be rads to keep my max health below 20%
---
Okay there is both a pro and con.   
---
Yes there can be more legendaries since there is no competition, but there is no quick respawns of mobs.   
---
Really the absolute biggest advantage over a public server is the workshops. You can take them all and do none stop event farming along with the goodies. Everything is just a server hop or two away for public.
---
I too would like a fuck bethesda sub.
---
Cite your source. I see no evidence of more legendary drops in private servers and I've read nothing that states to the contrary.
---
People shouldn't be griefing them, but with the amount of them defending Fallout 1st with comments like "sounds like you're poor" or "begone peasant," it's pretty much impossible for me to feel sorry for them. 
---
Besides, they have their own server to retreat to when they get griefed. What do we have if we get griefed? An ignore button that just hides your dot on the map from the griefer. Doesn't hide the camp, seeing as I've had to use the ignore button before and still ran across the griefers camp later in the session, which I then had to make a mental note of where the camp was so I could avoid it like the plague.
---
The blank one was the commie salute and yeah I noticed but never really used it, there should be some official response though since it was removed/ they broke it.
---
I keep travelling pharmacy on all the time and I never thought of this. I’ll try it, thanks!
---
Just finished hour 20 of outer worlds. Not really into it. It’s like a more boring mass effect.
---
Not much you can do except continue wearing it and ignore the bigots. Gamers in general don't have the best tolerance record.
---
Well, you see, all Bethesda has to do is give the people that have shit nonstop on every single decision and action they've made, everything for free (Including the game which they've previously done) and those people will in turn, still shit on Bethesda nonstop.
---
Oh yeah i forgot about actually trading, Thank you! I thought 100 caps is a good price though, i would pay around 200 caps maximum. I was expecting people to be selling them for around 250 - 300 caps each, but i’ll shop around. Thanks dude.
---
Yep. People are generally excited about seeing this armor, although most are disappointed when they learn it's subscription locked instead of being purchasable with atoms.
---
I took the assumption by sheer logic of no competition and by collecting data from ppl on this subreddit. U can do so urself.
---
Troll? Nobody believes his site is genuine and he doesn’t expect anyone to. What incorrect definition are you using here?
---
Nah I buy them for 70-100 and no more. They are not difficult to acquire and only a small part of the player base farms queens so there’s plenty to go around.
---
[removed]
---
It is worth to buy a month, skip a month, and buy a month
---
For make it simple
---
Month yes, month no, month yes...
---
The only solute I've seen on the emote wheel was the one you get from the tricentennial upgrade. There was a raider salute as well but I didn't purchase it so I don't know what it does. As far as the blank one, are you talking about the commie salute? I saw it in the emote menu but I was never able to find it on my wheel.
---
You’re paying the real price for fallout 1st

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*

Lol yeah, that's a great attitude to have. Everyone must entrench themselves heavily on every issue and scream at the top of their lungs to people that don't agree. 
---
Reddit is fucking stupid.
---
ask fo4
---
The true steaming piles of shit are the ass-hats that are funding Bethesda's efforts to fuck over their customers by paying for this shit.
---
There are more legendaries and quite a few people have stated that. I have the sub and in my private world I’ve noticed about 4-5 the legendaries easily. One run through whitesprings golf club nets at least 3-4 legendaries, west tek sometimes more. I can do that every 15-20 minutes, including silo runs and the burrows. I’m now having to offload scrip legendaries to my second account because it’s too heavy.
---
*Apparently my voice to text doesn't know how to spell salute.
---
Or Warframe.
---
I made 45k+ caps, and 110 levels in Adv., on one character from Overseer levels 0-130, strictly from NW.
---
I wouldn't know yet it's not been out long enughff if you fancy geting atoms why not get the month
---
I would play with my one friend who has it... but the friend system is $&amp;?! broken. Neither of us can send an invitation to the other. It. Just. Doesn’t. Work. The invitations never arrive.
---
Dont understand your comment then, sorry.
---
&gt;target the higher ups at Zenimax/Bethesda as they made the decision.
---
&gt;and quite frankly as a subscription holder I’m angry as well,
---
Why get it if it makes you angry and you believe the higher ups should be targeted for their decisions that your purchasing clearly supports? This isn't the first time I've seen someone who's pissed at the subscription still buy it anyway, and I really don't get the mindset there.
---
As ridiculous as half of the two first pages being "fuck Bethesda" and "I quit" melodrama posts from the usual suspects every update?
---
"This is how this subreddit should be.  It'll change Bethesda."  Give your balls a tug, titfucker.
---
You're a fool if you believe it's as simple as your half made up title and all these title posts you make are just to farm karma and antagonize people
---
They're funding Bethesda's concerted effort to screw over the rest of their customers.  They deserve zero respect.
---
Must be a real hoot at parties, kid.
---
Ok thanks, i haven’t really been searching for them, as i had no reason too. But now i am, i should notice more people selling them. 👍
---
I can only ignore Wastelanders? It doesn’t exist yet? It was delayed. That’s why I’m not talking about it because I have no opinion about it because I can’t. Wastelanders does not factor into my opinion of this bad decision and I don’t understand why everyone keeps bringing it up. One update can’t fix this broken mess of the game and with the trajectory they’re taking towards private servers and modding, I consider the game wholly unfixable no matter how good Wastelanders is (given the track record, I’m not expecting much from that one). This was my dealbreaker; I defended the game up through Nuclear Winter and was actually prepping for my return to it this week until the news broke.
---
Bethesda isn’t AS bad as it could be but they’re supposed to be better. Up until 76 they were considered one of the few pro-consumer companies left. All we’ve learned since 76 is that under capitalism, no corporation is incorruptible because corruption is incentivized. And just because they haven’t gone so far down the rabbit hole yet, doesn’t mean we should spare them now.
---
I would because I care about modding. But yeah, Wastelanders would have softened the blow because it would have obfuscated the problem. But it still would have been a problem.
---
awesome
---
You do get more drops, read my reply to the other guy for details. 4-5x, but you’ll still get 1* stuff from 3* enemies sometimes.
---
Also, stuff that usually takes a full day to respawn like the basketballs at the Grafton school respawn much quicker in private worlds. I usually do my junk run 3 times a day now if time allows, instead of once a day.
---
If you want to join the fun man just add me same name as on here
---
next step is free to play and more p2w
---
The Outer Worlds.  Created by Obsidian.  It's not online, but it's fun.  The original creators of Fallout know how to make a game.  Too bad they lost the license to Bethesda.
---
Well deserved
---
Do you need a hug?
---
Thx for the advice, DLing wow.exe now while listening to red army choir.
---
The whole thing clinches on the scrapbox. That's just pay2win.
---
Ok thanks, i never really noticed people selling them as i wasn’t searching for them, mainly as i had no reason too. But now i am, i should see more people selling them. 👍
---
When you are stupid enough to help fund Bethesda's ongoing effort to screw over their paying customers and then show up on public servers public servers flaunting it you deserve all the scorn coming your way.
---
It’s more honest to say he did play the game but stopped because of the problems frustrating him. Then this problem comes out instead of things getting better, which of course would make people even more upset.
---
Saying he doesn’t actually play the game is lying.
---
The person I'm replying to said "you're able to pay for server stability" and I'm saying "lately my private server hasn't been that stable" it was good the first night, then not so much. I don't think either one of us meant to be condescending
---
Support PTW and MTX you’re gonna have a bad time
---
But you did buy it expecting to be lied too. I dont know how that's any better.
---
Should disable them in ws.
---
That, together with the scrap box, would have never been a problem if Adventure and Private worlds were separate environments that needed separated characters and both scrapbox and camp budget only happened on Privates.
---
Right on, lol at snapping controllers it just happens sometimes! Way better than throwing them at monitors right...
---
And when you moved from gta v ps3 to ps4? Pay full price again suckers!  No discount for existing users who already paid full price.  That is when I quit gta v.
---
I don't like Fallout 1st.  Even the name kind of annoys me.  But I'll support other players' rights to enjoy the game however they play, whether they spend nothing after the initial purchase or dump $40 into the game every month to unlock all the Atom Shop content.
---
It takes all kinds to make a community.  That should be the American way too.
---
yeah it worked for me what i did was i took a photo with my phone before loading up Nuclear winter and compared the photo after the game when i loaded up Adventure mode.
---
ban people for playing the game?
---
Let me guess, you play on console. I play on PC and I have seen a minimum of game breaking bugs. I rarely get disconnected from server, I didn't experience the scrap box bug. I will admit I did get stuck in the power armor control lockout bug like three times. But other than that the game has been pretty smooth sailing other than the occasional enemy that stays standing after it's dead which I just take as a photo op to stand next to them. I've also had my character do their impression of the headless horseman when they jump out of their power armor but once again I just take it as a photo op.
---
Hey there, chap. I didn't im you. In fact I just checked to ensure that I didn't do so accidentally. I haven't im'd in months.
---
Sorry if you were offended by snark, and or if people are im'ing you. Rest assured I wouldn't be dm'ing snark directly to anyone deliberately.
---
Wrong. One can simultaneously enjoy a game they paid for while disagreeing with bad business practices.
---
They do, they added a few in game
---
nope it won’t level up i believe that part is the “big” but you do get the XP passed over from Nuclear Winter
---
&gt;	as a subscription holder I’m angry as well
---
Explain your doublethink... because if I’m angry at a company I’m not giving them money..... 
---
&gt;	we as a community do not need to have a divide
---
So why are you enabling the divide by paying money for the PTW mechanic that is enabling it 
---
&gt;	target the higher ups at Zenimax/Bethesda as they made the decision
---
Only if there was a way to send a message to companies that sell shit products in a way by not buying said shit tier product...?
---
I Think they’re worth a lot more than that
---
You could ask the nice people at Rockstar how they managed to 1) release a complete game functioning as promised 2) sold the game at industry-standard price 3) released it with a complete solo story and 4) an online mode with frequent updates that so far have not cost any additonal money and 5) kept the whole operation profitable. It is possible, it appears all you need is a competent studio. Either that or you can give BGS an additional $12/month they most certainly don't deserve.
---
FONV was great though, I have to agree with you on that the story was awesome the option to play through multiple factions is something I miss. It is definitely the most underrated episode in the franchise.
---
I've seen one response so far and he was just as pompous and dismissive as always. The rest is just retweeting official shit. How this so called PR/marketing vice president still has a job, is beyond me.
---
Re-read that whole sentence, slowly and methodically, and then realise that you are apart of the problem that is driving a wedge in this once friendly community.
---
You can thank Bethesda for that along with the imbeciles willing to enable their abusive behavior.
---
wild appalachia was a good thing
---
just do it
---
Doubt anybody put it in the feedback forms
---
I've been getting a lot more drops in public servers. Like easily 2x as many as I'm use to. I havent tries a private server yet.
---
Because I'm not on a good economical state but I want private servers, so if I skip a month on the middle, on 3 months I would spend 30€ instead of 45€ and I'll still having fun with the game
---
That was the best voice chat you have ever heard??  Wow you must be on Xbox....did the voice squeak like a pre-pubescent teen?
---
Oh and you condone this?  How childish....the dances are amazing maybe if you would like dunno do some chores around the house your dad...wait you probably don’t have one....your Mom might give you some dollars instead of GBP.
---
Straight up Korean MMOs garbage tactics right here.
---
2700?? 15k at least :)
---
I thought you can only put one of each down?
---
Hopefully they'll add New Vegas music out of spite for TOW they already have the ranger armor
---
Nope it’s a amazing.....especially if you craft and vend.
---
You're enabling their behavior.  You are part of the problem.
---
I cant stand griefers! This is why I am happy I have my own map! I will pay for that any day, I'm not a rich man, but it seems like a fair trade for unlimited scrap, the atoms and the dedicated map server!
---
Good luck with your future nuking!
---
I was still having a great time.  Then I saw 5he level of toxic and abusive commentary skyrocket on here last where I have ever seen any group of players summarily informed it was open season on griefing them.
---
If that level of toxicity isn't just Reddit bravado, and I seriously encounter it in game, then I will think seriously about walking away from something I've enjoyed whenever my health has allowed it for roughly a year now.
---
Not because of bad decisions or questionable timing of rollouts by the company, but because of the highest level of bullying and hatred I've seen here by far.
---
How dare anyone imply someone else shouldn't enjoy something to begin with.  But to take it a step farther as many on other threads have and openly call for the griefing of people enjoying themselves or choosing freely where or how their personal entertainment budget is allocatted?
---
If the loud toxic bullies end up as present in game as they are piping up here, you all will have won, because not only will I leave, I won't be back to a community that has become not just divisive about itself, but a showcase of the worst sort of mean-spirited elitism possible in today's world, mitigated only by the fact that we do not have evidence of any real world cruelties or crimes instigated by such vocally toxic bullying excuses for people.
---
Thank you for your help, You too!
---
I just like the armor
---
RIP maplestory
---
PC
---
The problem isn't that you want it. The problem is that you're willing to spend way too much to make it happen. You're willing to reward a company that has shown you and me nothing but contempt. You're literally paying for the same servers you already play on, but with a stricter character limit.
---
They didn't even bother testing this stuff before selling it to you! for $100, you get to beta test this feature.
---
And now, thanks to you, they can continue to abuse their loyal fans, and break more promises. Because your wallet is louder than anyone's voice.
---
why they targeting those who have advantages?
---
It might be. They're basically following the eso model with this subscription and with the unlimited crafting storage. in ESO when your subscription runs out you still have all your stuff stored in their version of The scrap box. Your stuff doesn't just disappear. you can still withdraw it or use it you just can't add more. so assuming it works the same you could subscribe for a month and load up your scrap box during that month, then take as many months off as you need until you need the extra scrap storage space. Until someone actually tries it though this is all speculation. and at least if you try it for one month you get your ranger gear and your emote dances and all the other stuff that doesn't go away when your subscription ends.
---
I’m sorry, I’m supposed to feel bad for them?
---
Oooh yeah that too. And it was a really recent re-release too
---
I think it's more because you're so dead set on trying to convince people not to enjoy things that they enjoy for completely objective reasons.  Would you prefer everybody just called you a Grinch or a party-pooper?
---
I like how most of the argument online turn into some sort of debate on what you should prioritise in your life or religion or some BS that wasn't the point.  Me arguing online for something I care about isn't hurting homeless people. So instead of trying to derail the argument, either quit responding or continue talking about the matter at hand.
---
We're discussing Bethesda's greedy business practices, not the importance of life.
---
Pshh, no one will see that. Do it in front of their offices IRL.
---
Treat it as a blessing!
---
This meta war within the game sounds a lot more interesting than anything the game has provided.  If it gets REALLY insane, I might just buy the game to bash in some 1sties
---
This is really cool and it’s nice to have something positive in this sub rn
---
I don’t know why people are posting these types of posts here. They are much better off posting this garbage in r/fallout and r/gaming where they are still circle jerking a private server fee. Which nearly all multiplayer games have
---
Exactly and that’s why I’m probably not gonna buy the thing when it first comes out but I disagree with one thing. I can support the game no matter how trash it is. But it’s your opinion not mine so say whatever you would like.
---
I've found it has gotten worse overall not better. I mean sure some major bugs were fixed like 3 nukes crashing the server, but players can still crash the servers with camp bugs, unkillable mobs are still a thing with high damage gear, sliding ghouls and scorched are still going, same with t posing, a half dozen of the perks still do not work or give the correct stated buffs on the cards. Legendary item drops are still broken with some effects only dropping on left pieces only, mobs still disappear sometimes when you kill them. Power armor can still freeze you up, etc.
---
Yeah they should be, you paid for “private server” and pay to win benefits, go use it!
---
Oh thanks
---
GTA online is also designed in a way to encourage players to buy R$ , sure it’s possible to be able to access all the new content in these constant updates without spending any real money but it’s going to be the longest and sweatiest grind as you have to constantly fork over millions of R$ .
---
&gt;
---
Rockstar are clever in the way of handling GTA online but they are equally bad as Bethesda just in another way .
---
Yeah and you're normalizing it. So when we have to pay a $100 sub fee just to even get past the start screen, you're the kind of person who's going to be responsible for things getting that far. 
---
So as someone who enjoys playing video games for a hobby, thanks for fucking them up for everyone else. It's a real shame you want to do that to yourself too.
---
&gt;Their fear of missing out has made the world a little worse.
---
Isn't it all the whining hatewagoners who were complaining about not getting exclusive outfits?  From my perspective, they're the only ones making the non-in-game community absolutely insufferable.
---
maybe this is why the world is still in total chaos even 200 years later
---
I have it but I have yet to use my private server. The private server does seem like a good way to load up on fusion cores if you wear PA because you could capture the Poseidon power plant, turn on the fusion core harvester and not have to worry about some level 300 rolling in and one shotting you to take your workshop. TBH though I haven't needed to try this because I just took Poseidon in PVE a few times and I've got 45 fusion cores sitting in my stash.
---
Depends on internet connection, but it will be a few hours. It’s a huge game so make sure you have the space for it available.
---
I too enjoy a good harassing of those I disagree with
---
The joke is on the salty: living the high life on my private little world.
---
Its not free it was $60 or less and they're the ones that said it was going to be free. Not us. So email Bethesdea that question.
---
Is the PvP so bad in Fo76 that you forgot it even existed?
---
Yeah that dude needs to stop having his own opinion and just agree with you.  Why doesn’t he get that?
---
I’m in Aus and out pricing is pretty much the same. For the ranger armour though I’m pretty sure that if you buy 1 month and get the armour and caps then cancel you get the keep the armour.
---
Fucking good. Fuck the players that rahe a slap to the face, turn the other cheek and say "please Todd may I have another?"
---
Look at Rockstar. Bethesda definitely already has their funding. Everyone defending Fallout 1st is saying "Oh I already spend a bunch on atoms every month so I might as well buy this"
---
So clearly people are buying them. They shouldn't make promises they can't keep, if they actually can't keep them. In reality they probably can but just want more cash and don't care if it means lying.
---
You don't get any more than you would jumping public servers, sometimes you get less as there is not another player coming in to force the respawm.
---
I'd love a hug.  Two questions. How many Atoms does it cost and are there any game breaking bugs attached to it?
---
My mindset is that I wanted the ranger outfit and scrapbox, but I’m angry that they have paywalled that content, I’m angry that they lied about the too many items cause server instability. Just because I’m against them for paywalling content, doesn’t mean I’m not going to buy it, I still have the power to speak up for their wrongdoings however I like the game and as a consumer I’m not going to pass up an advantage I can buy. 
---
I do understand where you are coming from.
---
While I can agree with you and very much enjoy the game. The only reason people are being this toxic is because otherwise nothing would be done about it. Some things people have done are a little over the top but I can understand most of the things people have said and done
---
Makes me the cringe that some of you dont understand the “90%” part of my post is a hyperbole and further proves my point that most people here don’t actually care about the game itself and are here to be mad at something on the internet
---
Modern problems require modern solutions
---
Also i wouldnt call red deads online a success idk how it is now but i know 6 months ago it was terrible barebones no content there was alotta complaints about it and
---
Quality of life changes that correct issues with the base game being locked behind a paywall is absurd and no beuno. It's pretty simple rly. Charging for servers is fine.
---
Probably made up by the OP. I've played at least 10 hours since Fallout 1st, and not one person has said a negative thing about my Ranger armor. Did Encryptid last night, there were 8 people there, three of them were wearing ranger armor. Also, I've seen more robot emotes during events or in other people's camps than I care to count.
---
So, not only are people not griefing that much, it's not even unpopular for people to have the armor. $13 for a very requested armor and $16.50 worth of Atoms is a good deal, even if you never use the rest of the stuff
---
It depends on your connection speed. The game is roughly 50 gigs in size, so if your connection is 100 mbit it would take approximately 1 hour 10 minutes.
---
Bethesda drove the wedge very very deep the minute they put this shit out there. Fuck em and all the shills who buy into this garbage.
---
Yup. I run up to anyone in NCR ranger gear and give them a big thumbs DOWN
---
Polygon is trash anyway. They have a very "Hot Take" approach to journalism, and I don't personally waste my time reading their columns.
---
Someone call the whaaaaabulance.
---
&gt; It is clear that playing on private server yields much more legendaries than on public. 
---
Is it?
---
Public or private, there has always been such a thing as a "hot server" where Legendary drops are way more common than on others.
---
What QoL changes are going to be behind a paywall?
---
If your on PS4 and ever wanna play on mine your more than welcome. And you can do whatever, I don't do PVP. My PSN is HillbillyDLUX08, let me know. I'm on at least every day.
---
Hatewagoners, nice one. What about the white knights defending shitty business practice to the point outright lies are told to sell games.
---
My opinion:
---
On its own, fo 1st os resonablyly priced way to get a private server, and the extras are pretty ok.
---
The issue it with Bethesda breaking pretty much every promise they made at E3 about 76, delaying content for bs reasons, then in the space of the delay, basicly asking for more money.
---
Would still be impressive even if he died 20 times. The time limit plus electrical damage is ludicrous. Though the health scaling maybe lower due to less players.
---
I agree with all your points except the last Bethesda is reaching new levels of greed
---
throwing around "not p2w" like it's an auto shoe in for arguments. that's not the issue here. it's been posted,discussed and rehashed. but ya all stuck on that as the go to argument to justify hushing everyone.
---
That's the least self aware thing I've heard all week, by you labelling one group shills and the others as not, then *you* are the tip of the spear that is driving this community in two because *you* are the one having some kind of delusion of classism.
---
I too enjoy it when a corporate entities pretend to care about less than 1% of the entire US population for a month, while also making up more random days after the fact :)
---
The reason you don’t know why is because the private server fee isn’t what players are pissed about
---
I was sweating bullets last night since nothing was selling, and my stash was at 798.  Two vendomatics full of camp plans; one machine with a handful of legendaries, ammo, combatnplans and boosts; and a last macine of junk and a few plans.  All were priced dirt dirt cheap as is my norm.  No action, but someone took the crafted food and left dog food at my exchange table, so there was at least one visitor.
---
As I'm cleaning up on scorched and scorchneasts in the Bog, "ka-ching", followed by a few more....and it didnt stop at a few items.  Nope.  Said person completely cleaned me out.  He was buying items without even stopping to breathe! More than sixty plans, junk, combat items....all gone!  Opened up 300 storage in my stash. 
---
Soze  I send a thank you message and enquire if he was going to resell for profit, since my prices are that low. Nope.  Turns out that hes a Fallout family ringleader.  He's retired, with grown kids and grandkids who play fallout.  Some play infrequently. But it's a way they all stay in touch, and he's used the game to teach his kids about resilience, back-up planning, etc.  He was buying to save the fam from some of the boring logistics and allow more quality time.  Pretty neat.
---
And now you know the rest of the story...
---
PSA: Rumbly's Roost in Toxic Valley will be out of business for a while due to supply issues.
---
Hey, if this game gets a 95 meta I'll eat my shirt and play it over the winter break. But as a man who has been fooled by EA into buying not one, but 2 trash star wars games, I'm not taking a risk on this one, and I suggest other folks at least wait for the review before laying down the cash.
---
But yeah, eat all the garbage you want, yolo.
---
It doesn't. But, that unfortunately doesn't fit into the irrational **free everything forever** entitlement, so any rational discussion of it, is immediately capsized.
---
Ron Paul 2076
---
Maybe it depends on the display case? I was able to put a PA chassis in the tall glass display.. lol it was ridiculous. But can't do Jangles! 
---
Also, I know it'd probably be a lot on the server but I wish we could display our power armor that we have painted lol would love to be able to set out one of each type or something. Or even just a limit of 2 or 3 armors.
---
The reason everyone is so angry is because this is part of a bigger issue. In the beginning, the vice president of Bethesda himself said the game would not be monetized in any way, except for cosmetic ONLY microtransactions from the atom shop. The other reason is that a lot of the things the subscription provides are things the community has asked for since day one, especially Private servers, so people could mod them and have fun with their friends. Bethesda broke the cosmetic only promise and the promise to monetize the game with paid DLC or subscription services. They took the feed back and requests from the community that has been supporting them despite everything, and put it behind a ludicrous paywall. And the lie and say it's what the players want, despite every time they do something like this, the players get mad. 13$ a month or 100$ a year is quite a lot, especially for a game people already paid for, or of maybe they dont have a lot of money. The subscription service is just the last straw. I find 76 to be a fun experience at its core, but Bethesda has mismanaged and put greed first. THAT is why people are angry.
---
Did you try joining the brotherhood of steel?
---
Turning everything off and turning it back on also might work.
---
Good. You should be ashamed you are supporting scams and lies. Your purchase will affect everyone, as Bethesda will continue putting stuff behind a paywall if more people buy it.
---
Preeetttyyy much. Just a bunch a Bobs usuing stealthboys, teslas, and jumping around like rabbits. And now the more i think about it, i hope this does kill whats left of the pvp in the game. Those ass hats have brought it to the point of extinction, might as well finish it off on my terms.
---
Happens when you force close from a public server and reopen into a private, from what I’ve been told. I’m just careful about force closing (closing app from outside)
---
That being said - I don’t mind $8 and change a month, the discounted atoms and I love the deep storage. Gives me extra room to work on my Assassins sentinel set and anti-asshole weapons.
---
Except that all you're doing is making them even more thankful they have their own servers now that they can escape to. I don't agree with their choice to get the subscription at all, but let's not add fuel to their fire by griefing them.
---
Where is this data that states 1st subscribers have more legendary spawns on a private server than a public server?
---
In my time with it over the past few days it is utterly random. Same as a public world. 
---
I have had a few times where my private world did not spawn any legendary enemies or I at least didnt encounter any.
---
Lol all the videos and gameplay i watched is what I got ...I give 2 shits  about what some corporate pr guy says about his game this goes for all games I buy
---
“Let then eat atoms”
---
Just leaving this here.  Seems somewhat relevant. 
---
https://youtu.be/n5aZJLkmF3Y
---
Whatever dude. I wish I only had to worry about what a corporation was doing. Must be really nice.
---
You've been consistently called out for overreacting. You continue to overreact. Your maturity level leaves a lot to be desired in a human being.
---
Enjoy the rest of your night. I've got to go give Bethesda my cc info in honor of you.
---
Couldn't agree more, yes the game is bugged and has flaws but as you said they are working on improving it and the seasonal events are pretty cool
---
I've already subscribed to the service because like ESO plus I enjoy the scrapbox.
---
People are complaining about the price but each separate instance of the server costs so I feel it's worth it also considering if you were to buy atoms alone they are valued at more than the subscription.
---
I'm really enjoying just exploring and taking photos in cool places, building my C.A.M.P and workshops. I found the storyline so far reasonably enjoyable in that it passed several hours without me noticing too much.
---
So again, I agree people who don't like the idea of the service or the game should just leave and let the rest of us build a fantastically friendly community free of haters and trolls
---
The only real QoL change besides Private Servers is the new Unlimited Junk Stashbox. I do agree that it could theoretically be available to everyone. I don't keep a bunch of scrap, so it doesn't benefit me that much. Also, it appears you can't put bulk junk in it anyway. So I can barely use it.
---
I thought we agreed on peaceful protests THEN these kinds if Bethesda wouldn’t listen? I mean, kill them with kindness first THEN launch the rages nukes!
---
It's not even a 'private server' though. It's just another instance really. Any private server you would pay for in other games would actually be persistent. This requires players to actually be in the private world for anything to continue to happen. So that part isn't even worth it.
---
"Let's give these people even more reason to use the ripoff subscription they paid for while simultaneously being angry at them for buying that steaming pile of shit. That'll teach them."
---
That's fair, and you're definitely within your rights. But for me, Wastelanders factors in. Where the game is at this moment would be impossible to justify if they continue adding fees without actual meaty content. 
---
I got worried about Beth when they tried to push creative club. I'm sure zenimax saw how profitable ESO became with mtx and is seeing its potential in the rest of their games. How much of mtx in fallout or elders scrolls offline are determine solely by Beth, or if they pushback, I'm not sure.
---
Outside government policy change, the best we do is voice what we can change.
---
Double check in the atomic shop emote section. Sometimes they unequip themselves and you have to go back in there and re-equip them.
---
And wearing Nike’s to protest poor labor practices. Etc etc.
---
Well if they follow ESO...
---
1sters will get unlimited crafting storage (already done)
---
1sters will get bonus currency (already have free atoms)
---
1sters will get double stash space, aside from unlimited component storate
---
1sters will get increased cap drops and experience
---
1sters will get double camp budget
---
1sters will get armor customization
---
1sters will get special atom store deals
---

---
I’m not responsible for people targeting subscription holders, that’s their problem they should take to Bethesda/Zenimax, people like me will obviously buy P2W content if we want to spend money on it. 
---
Sure, I mean no one gives a shit if I’m angry as I bought the subscription, what exactly am I showing Bethesda, well I find it a shame that they the made this decision, i feel as the pay walled content should be available for everyone. 
---
At the end of the day, I like the game, therefore I’m going to buy content that gives me an advantage, I don’t like the way how they’re selling it but realistically it’s how companies are nowadays, all about the money and not giving a shit about consumers.
---
Because idiot complainers have apparently never heard of a mule character before nor have they compared the cost of private worlds from the rest of the industry or even the cost of running a private server before.
---
Most are just NPCs repeating the complaints of greedy duplicitous clickbait youtubers recycling plagiarized old footage of the bugs at LAUNCH and passing it off as their own current footage of them playing the game.  In fact, the most these asshole Youtubers ever spent in Fallout 76 was probably 10 minutes at best at launch and they haven't actually played the game since.
---
But there is the platinum, a optional highly priced premium currency used to buy cosmetics and some very bad “p2w” objetcs like extractors and the possibility to trade with players for any object in the game that have grinded for so you dont have to spend hours doing so.
---
Don’t get me wrong, i love warframe but similarities in in game currency overpriced are evident but they aren’t getting bad rep for it.
---
That doesn't seem like a QoL change to me just a more inconvenience change for most players. I've played plenty of games that have way worse storage systems then what they have and the limit based been increased a lot since Launch.
---
The tent too.
---
GTAO is a great example of ripping off your fan base with overpriced vehicles that you can either spend hours grinding to purchase or, oh wow how convenient that Rockstar will allow me to buy a Megalodon card for only $99.99 so I can buy that Oppressor I’ve always wanted.
---
They keep their tax returns in that last folder.
---
I’ve done the entire BOS quest line. I got the ultracite power armor. I’ve turned technical data in before, idk what’s wrong now.
---
This is actually very interesting and worth reading.
---
I think that quest gets bugged on certain characters. On my main character, the quest never popped up no matter what I tried. But on my second one it works just fine.
---
Imagine still supporting this garbage game from a now garbage studio
---
I'll buy the subscription when they put the armor in the Atom Shop, the scrap box in the base game, and the forward tent behind a quest with skins for the tent in the Atom Shop. Until then, I refuse to give them money for something I don't support. All that says to them is that they can continue to treat me how ever they please and I'll just eat it right up, even if I eat it up with an angry expression on my face.
---
I don’t think they can do that because some of them are different sizes
---
Kind of unrelated, but is there a communist outfit in the game to wear?
---
My son is a U.S. Marine, and once or twice a week we get to spend some time together online killing super mutants and scorched. It’s not as good as getting to see him in person, but it’s better than just the letters or phone calls. 
---
We’ve also met a few very generous people who have accompanied us into some places that have kicked our asses, or made us weapons that we wouldn’t have been able to have otherwise. I haven’t actually encountered a single griefer (touch wood) in the time we’ve been playing. 
---
Appalachia rocks!
---
Itb was a technical limitation right upuntil they started charging extra for it. Funny that, isn't it.
---
Are people forgetting they also run Elder Scrolls Online? With unlimited Crafting storage if you subscribe?
---
Pete Hines himself even makes the comparison so it's not as if there isn't anything to it:

---
The tent is also not a QoL change. There are already tons of places to Fast travel too including your own camp which you can put almost anywhere you want.
---
I have 800 caps and 100 atoms, these higher classes have nicer and fancier clothing than us hard working cultists or first responders. We work hard for our caps, time for a economy crash and protests!
---
lol the most expensive shark card in GTAO is a fucking $99.99 yet you praise Rockstar. You guys are so ridiculous.
---
This post didnt age well lol. Bethesda admits many lost everything.
---
Most of these neg posts are by people who don't play the game is the main reason. If it was only people actively playing the game you wouldn't see so many posts about it. Not sure where they come from, haven't actually gotten an answer besides a name... "Yongyea," whatever that means lol
---
The unlimited scrap and extra tent both address player complaints with the base game. The infinite scrap is especially problematic considering it was intentionally created as a problem and now they can magically fix it for 14 a month. Tactic taken straight out of Korean MMOs which have been ridiculed for decades.
---
Exactly. That's the way I look at it. Good bundle. Will I resub? Lol, no. Not unless they include more cool armors. But for a one time purchase this is an ok deal. 
---
Agreed, I really think OP is making it up and trolls are fanning/upvoting it.
---
YOULL MAKE A FINE RUG, CAT
---
You can get an even better storage space by creating an alt, and using it as a mule. I don't think it's as harsh as people being 'lied to'. I think it was a business decision to generate more revenue to keep thr game running and profitable.
---
I see the scrapbox advantage more psychological than functional. There are limits to daily npc sales, and junk doesn't move very quickly past vendors. What do you think the p2w advantages are?
---
Because you idiots will buy it either way.
---
Sounds like you both get what you want right?
---
As I said above, I’m not responsible for how people behave, if your mindset is to abuse players who bought the subscription then in my opinion I think that’s immature. Bethesda/Zenimax pull the strings, quite frankly I personally really want this game to succeed but it’s going down the drain and that’s an understatement.
---
U r my hero
---
You can’t really compare fallout 1st to eso plus. With eso plus you get more content with the expansions than the entirety of content for fallout 76. There’s just no comparison here.
---
This game just doesn’t have the content deserving of such a high priced subscription, not to mention that one of the features shows that the dev team have straight lying to the community in regards to scrap storage.
---
That's still cheaper than the Vault  Tech X01 skin.
---
I wonder why it's this community... there are FAR worse games out there.

I didn’t give you enough credit; you’re actually pretty cool.
---
I think they need to give us the meaty content first though before they start charging us for anything. Their track record leaves something to be desired and they have a lot of trust they need to build back up. After doing that, then it would soften the blow of a subscription but dropping it now and for server access is just going to turn people off from what’s to come, even if it’s good.
---
I didn’t even have Creation Club as a concept. I’ve always maintained that modelers should have an avenue to profit off of their hard work. But in execution it was totally botched IMO. And I don’t think Bethesda learned anything from that experience.
---
Yes. And MAYBE I could stand to be a little less abrasive in doing that. Maybe.
---
I'm not sure I'll be around for Wastelanders.   Please understand, I do not consider myself to be boycotting the game.   I just can't bring myself to play it after Fallout 1st fiasco.  It really does feel like a slap in the face to those of us who have spent endless hours grinding since BETA.    I feel insulted, and I feel like the insult is deliberate.
---
Well yea, but we are allowed to criticize people flat out allowing a company to take advantage of them and charging for shit that mostly should have been included.
---
None of that matters or makes a difference. The only thing that matters is revenue. Someone spending any amount of money on Fallout 76 is supporting it and Bethesda's practises and is by extension against gaming and anti consumer. It's 
---
You enjoying the game today means we might be paying a subscription just to get past the start screen tomorrow.
---
Like you said its far from perfect. It has year old issues still unresolved. The DLCs we have gotten have been very subpar to say the least. Arkos was literally unplayable for weeks and might still be.  Theres also the fact that they said before beta everything would be free. I think alot of us understand the realities of business, they need to make money we can all get that. Its just how theyve gone about it with 76 has been wrong at every turn. They just go on like its business as usual. No acknowledgement of anything.
---
There hasnt been enough of an improvement to 76 since launch that most players are cool with them asking us for more money. When so many issues still exist or have been ignored. Why would you pay when you have a years worth of data proving the improvements arent there and theres plenty of complaints with issues of the private servers. Nothing has changed except they want us to pay more.
---
You can call it overreacting all you want, I'm sure you don't mind predatory microtransactions and being repeatedly slapped in the face by a corporation and still defending them.
---
You can pay them all you want. I'm just saying doing so will just encourage them to make more low effort garbage.
---
No competition on clearing legendary spawns.
---
You can use them in NW? That's not good...
---
I totally don’t blame you and that’s the way it should of been, I get paying for private servers but paying other content that should be added for free is really not fair.
---
Fixing a player complaint is not a QoL change. Yes players need to speak up when things aren't going the right way but also companies need to not always give in to entitled players who complain about every little thing when they dont get their way.
---
It will, for an additional payment of $ 59,99
---
Lol
---
Thank you, sadly, Im PC.
---
This is a troll post.  
---
&gt;we decided to support this great feature
---
If you think this is a great feature right now with this implementation with this amount of content with this broken of a game your beyond help
---
Aw, now I feel bad. I’ll watch it, maybe cringe was the wrong word
---
&gt; What do you think the p2w advantages are?
---
Inventory management takes hours of playtime that could be spend leveling, looting etc.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
First, I bought Fallout 1st or whatever it’s called.
---
But let’s be realistic, it’s a huge QoL item.  I’m a really big trader, ammo maker, etc.  I’ll use the example of what I did this morning.  I went to farm lead from the silos to make more 5.56.  Like usual I get encumbered after I pick up the lead weights (even though I carry over 600lbs) and I normally have to take the slow walk to the nearest train station to scrap the barbells into lead. Now, I walk right out of the silo elevator, drop my tent, use the scrapbox, head to the next silo.
---
The time it takes me to farm lead is half what it used to be.  To me, that’s a huge advantage.
---
Lol buddy this is about as normal as it gets. You want, you pay. When you come up with your own online game and I like it then I might pay for a premium service as well. Until then I'll pay Beth like every other person is going to do(Even most of the ones that are saying they wont pay).
---
Hahaha. XD
---
They spawn at night. Pods turn into blooms at night
---
"Truth is, the game was rigged from the start"
---
Why are you still playing it then?
---
Bethesda's hatred is global, or it seems to be.
---
Its funny cause its true. :(
---
They've added a lot of stuff that was requested since release and didn't put them behind a paywall. Player vending, backpacks, even vault raids. And when we asked for more end game content they added Encryptid and Project Paradise. If they didn't listen to our suggestions the game would be in a much worse state, they didn't think of half of the additions themselves. That means they listen to the community and work towards improvements. Developers should be compensated for their work, and servers aren't free besides
---
That game sucked ass. Ten minute horse rides with no fast travel at will. I quit after doing a mission where I had ride a slow carriage with 5 min dialogue only to die to the most random glitch. I respawned had to ride all the way back and go through it again. Yeah, no thanks.
---
What is the "hot server"? Im not familiar with that, could you explain?
---
The only bug I want fixed is the spin up for the gat plasma and minigun
---
I feel like this subreddit is the only place where you can find someone who'd upvote this comment
---
Those water heads deserve it. Keep up the good work
---
I challenge you to show how anyone purchasing this subscription‘screws anyone else over’. 
---
Atom Shop purchases are 100% optional.  The purchases one player makes have no impact an another player’s game experience.
---
Someone else buying the fridge has no effect on your gameplay. The same is true for everything in the subscription. 
---
It doesn’t let another player force PvP on you without your consent. It doesn’t allow another player to take your resources. And so on. 
---
I didn’t see this type of vitriol over the Atom Bundles. And Bethesda never said the private servers would be free. 
---
 
---
They’ve broken promises in the past. But nothing in this package was ever promised for free.
---
Yep, Rockstsr's vehicles are overpriced, but it really doesn't take that long to get one. You can easily make a million in a few hours if your focused. 
---
At least they don't lock stuff like private servers behind a mandatory paywall. I almost wonder if they purposefully made their servers bad just so they could entice people to buy the private servers.
---
Imagine if every game made you pay to have your shots hit consistently. Or to not lag.
---
lol look another person who doesn't even play the game posting here, where'd you come from OP? I probably won't get an answer. Just another negging astroturfer
---
didnt say i agree with everything.. just sayin for me it works and im enjoying the game none the less......hopefully they will fix (at least some) of the issues Soon (TM) lol
---
What the word of the month people are using now to describe someone who does something that they don’t like?  Oh yeah, bootlickers. 
---
Bootlickers are paying for 1st.
---
Outside of the scrap box, most of the subscription doesn't really affect the gameplay itself. And I think the sub is cheaper than ESO. I think I was paying $15 per month for that one, plus the housing that was ridiculously priced, as some were around $100. People can get around the scrap box by using a mule. I would pay the sub just to play the game honestly.
---
fallout 76 isnt a MMO it more like a fallout game with tacted on online that wasnt really handled that great lol.
---
Wait a second... don't you realize you just gave worthless opinion yourself??? Keep swallowing Todd's loads. Maybe he'll take 10% off of a cool Blue sweater!!
---
There will be soon
---
Did you find them in the world or purchase them from a vending machine?
---
He looked like a David! Good for your friend. Any publicity is good publicity haha
---
Borderlands 3 for me
---
I’m sorry you have autism, but I don’t understand why that means you require Fallout 1st.  I’m disabled myself, have close family members who are autistic, and I just don’t see the correlation.  If not having the subscription is causing you anxiety and you aren’t enjoying the gaming experience, maybe it’s time to play another game or activity.
---
Peace was never an option 🔪
---
Not much they can do really.  Fallout 1st has provoked near universal disdain.  They don't plan on removing the paywall for the scrap stash, so what is there for the community managers to say? 
---
I doubt they will tell us, "We understand your frustration with Fallout 1st but you're fucked."  
---
So I guess silence is really the only option.
---
Believing youre better then others strictly based on what you game on is more "rude" than anything I could say
---
Uhh when the problems are major inconveniences and actively make the experience worse then yes the changes to address those issues are by definition quality of life improvements.
---
But you know you still have to invest the same amount of game play collecting that junk, right? It's just in a single chunk of time, rather than staggered resource collection.
---
And by the time you're at end game, you should know how to easily manage your inventory. I didn't worry about junk much after level 30. Having about 50-100 of each typical scrap type infrequently used and 150-300 of commonly used scrap with 500 screws and 700 springs + room for my weapons, armor, and such.
---
Eat the rich
---
And spouting the same stuff like "this is a garbage game"? Someone just posted something like that, only dissing the game and those who bought it
---
This^^^^^
---
You should be embarrassed.
---
Did you buy it or Pick up multiple pieces before turning 1 in?
---
How dare they pay into the game so everyone else keeps getting the rest of it for free...
---
You do realize that this subscription is no different from buying a pack of atoms, hell it's a better deal because you're getting a better value of atoms and all the extra perks. If you're going to pick on someone for wearing the ranger armor you may as well pick on anyone wearing something from the atom shop because maybe they also and gave Bethesda money.
---
If you find more than one, it becomes useless.
---
Pick up one, turn in. Pick up next one, turn in...
---
No batches, for whatever reason. Lazy programming.
---
It's almost laughable to dumb it down so much considering the professional ethics concerns in business, economics, etc these days. But yeah, making money is the purpose of business.
---
Class struggle is alive and well in Appalachia, a historic hotbed of lefty worker’s revolts (Gotta love the striker camps and strikebreaker bots in the AH). I for one am glad our comrades are punishing the scabs selling out their fellow workers for the business
---
Don't attack me like this I'm fragile enough already, blizzard has already done enough as is /s
---
I’m not a shill because I didn’t pay another fucking 13/100 dollars in this broken ass dead and dying game on top of the 300 I already spent for a collectors edition. So yes sir I am not a shill and all of your big fancy words about classism don’t mean anything, stop trying to be the moral high ground.
---
#you fool, you have incurred the wrath of the gods
---
What level were you to begin with? At my current level on one character I'm 277, ain't no way I'm leveling up 25 times doing workshop defends
---
It is not. I'm not hating Bethesda for their last... perfomance, but i don't really care for Halloween and it's music themes.
---
sucker
---
So the demographic who spent money griefing is somehow indicative of the entire group, but the other group laughing about them being griefed isn’t?
---
We all have opinions. I'm enjoying it.
---
Om xbox if u running raids I'll like to tag alone. We can server hop on the private realm
---
Imagine paying an extra $100 a year to play the same single player
---
**hugs** 
---
I think its included with the subscription and it's not game breaking it's more annoying but I don't own it so it's more of a shirt wait till it works I've only seen people have trouble 2 times though and it worked on the second ot third try.
---
I-is this vore?
---
I agree. I liked the game partly for the fact people were mostly civil with each other. It was the player base that made it. While I am total for people boycotting it, I’m against griefing people just cause they bought it.
---
I have a good amount of friends with the subscription, so I just join their private servers.
---
Good! They deserve it.
---
I don’t care what you nerds call me. I’m not against playing this game, I’m against them squeezing more and more money out the players. I don’t care if you enjoy the game, I’m not stopping that, but if you’re somehow enjoying paying another $100 for trash, then I’m like what the fuck. That’s bad for everybody, it’s bad for the people *paying* for it. It tells Bethesda and Zenimax to continue doing shit like this. But people are dumb and fan boys deserve to pay at this point
---
If u want we can link up and server hop on the private side. I need the strangle power armor
---
Fortnite has the best iteration of battle pass wether you like it or not because guess what? A one time purchase can unlock every single season if you play enough. It isn’t give or take it’s just a good system to keep your player base and not overcharge them each season.
---
&gt;stop trying to be the moral high ground.
---
You mean tell people to stop harassing others who opted in for an optional membership? No, no I think I'll stay right where I am.
---
I want to play Outer Worlds, but refuse to support Epic.  Such a rough life.
---
This game i can care less about at this point - But if any of this crap lands in elder scrolls 6 - Like i am still concerned player uploaded mods will be locked behind a monthly subscription now  for 6 as well as some type of way to add loot boxes and restrict what items can be picked up so there will be a "reason" to buy cosmetics when all of this was free in the previous title
---
Yeah let’s give em a reason, we don’t want them here. Their benefits are pay to win and have ruined any hope for having an economy in game. Keep them out of the adventure servers :)
---
It’s not even that if you’ve purchased and completed previous battle passes because then you will never have to pay again if you use the V bucks earned to buy the next season.
---
The game did the right thing, now forget about it and come and play Warframe with us.
---
This is about 0% about controlling you pal. Keep being delusional.
---
Regardless of your math it’s still pay 2 win.
---
&gt; At least 5 - 7 people in teddy bear costumes kept punching me.
---
[Relatable.](https://youtu.be/qfC7IhQjg6k?t=38)
---
Good.
---
Randy Savage scorchbeast mod.
---
No, and neither are your friends. They make a mess, eat all the food then leave.
---
My karma is high enough I dont need to farm it. I'm just having a lough at people who cant grasp economics.
---
The subscription shouldn’t exist at all period. Stop rationalising a shitty business practise, especially from Bethesda who have already thrown you through a fucking loop over this game. None of you deserve to be treated like this for sticking with the game and none of you should have to pay for shit that should have been here since release.
---
The irony being your repeating the same NPC talk to discredit anyone who has a problem with 1st. But tell us more about these mules and how to play our own game. Nobody wants to be an idiot.
---
Road map was thrown out the window, fanboys want the argument of "well, they did add content for free...Burrow,encryptid,arktos"...but what these fools fail to realize is that shit was cut out of the game before launch and given or shown to be free when we already paid for it in the initial cost of the game. Nothing justifies the price of Fallout 1st and it not worth more than maybe $3 a month.
---
We have to get this trending and try to get this on multiple platforms. PC, Playstation, Xbox, all three but there is a chance on low attendance on PS since there's normally 6 people per server...
---
Literally has pay to win. You can straight up buy money in GTA
---
Dude you're talking pieces of a quote and adding your opinion of what you think it means. Thats not being objective. 
---
This is another quote from a different interview. And as you can see what he said then is not true now. Second to last sentance stands out to me but Im also not screaming from the roof tops about lies 
---
“All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,” explains Hines; “all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”
---
No you're just acting like they are by justifying people going out of their way to troll anyone who buys a subscription. 
---
Sounds like a bunch of salty snowflakes getting mad that other people are able to enjoy something that they can't.
---
Rockstar? The ones who sell ingame money for USD?  Ok.
---
Don't know if it was different before, but extractors don't cost any platinum. There are "prime" extractors that are more of a prime cosmetic (like prime cloaks and weapon charms) that are usually vaulted and you can buy em for cash, but you don't need to.
---
On the other hand you do need plat in order to buy extra slots for warframes and weapons, which you will need to do in order to really enjoy the game. But the game is free and a single "prime vault" pack (60 bucks) would give you all the plat you'd ever need for that purpose, plus the vaulted primes and cosmetics to boot. 
---
Point is Warframe doesn't need to charge a subscription to keep the lights on, the servers up, or deliver new content.
---
And I’ll stay right where I am, angry at a company I once loved, that I have given thousands of dollars. I’ll stay angry at the people encouraging them to continue, these are the people that are going to have contributed to killing the Nexus when Starfield and ES6 hit, because no way in hell are they allowing free mods in those titles if this continues.
---
I'm sure they'll treat us as good as they treat the ESO players.
---
Do yourself a favor, and don't look that up.
---
It's your money. Spend it how you want. Plain and simple.
---
This is something that would make me play again
---
At least wait to see how it is when wastelanders drops. That’s what I’m doing anyway
---
Saying the content in FO76 is richer than fortnite is purely your opinion.
---
That was an awesome read lol
---
I don’t see a need for private servers. You can’t buy stuff from other players (aside from your friends), it’s exactly like a regular world, besides all the other players, and for me at least, other players don’t attack me, instead they drop me food and junk I can use. (I’m only level 17 btw) So to me, it’s better playing in a standard world
---
I’ve never bought them
---
Finally, a person of culture. This sub loves to shit on fortnite but I mean, the irony. There’s a reason fortnite stays on top of the charts, because it’s free so any charges after look less greedy right out of the gate, the battle pass is a decent price, they listen to feedback and community suggestions. Bethesda knows fortnite is superior, but they don’t understand why. That’s why they paid Ninja to promote 76 before it came out, just the most out of touch thing you could do
---
I mean probably. I’ve got 70
---
How do I fix it though? I can’t turn any in
---
It's cool, and lore-wise it wont exist for another 85 years at least, let alone across the country in West Virginia, so congratulation on another Fallout 1st!
---
Make your own choices.
---
If you feel that having a private server is worth the cost, get it.
---
If you don't, then don't.
---
Take one bite now and spit the rest.
---
Opinions are amazing.  But, like assholes, everyone has one.  That IS crazy!
---
Nuke mines kill with rads, even if you're not in pvp
---
Good, they deserve it. The bots and fridge does absolutely nothing wortheile while 1st brigades send money to dumb bullshit. Get fucked.
---
By gutting the servers and lighting the Austin studio on fire, they will have killed the game, therefore the bugs
---
My God someone who actually understands how these items are bs and give major quality of life improvements to subs.
---
Name me a game still getting unique game breaking bugs A YEAR LATER.
---
The bug where you can't fast travel if you die over encumbered is back too.
---
I keep flip-flopping on what I want to do, though. Spending that money would be giving Bethesda what they want, and I honestly think they're in the wrong to charge at all for this, but I'm WEAK because private servers sound WONDERFUL
---
I’m not a fan of fortnite but I’m not gonna sit here and shit on it or let someone act as if it’s inferior when what they do is pretty respectable. So many games have tried and in my opinion failed to replicate a battle pass on the level that fortnite has because if you can charge a one time fee that will make it so you never have to buy another one again then you’re basically set for a consistent player base. I won’t comment too much on how much they listen to feedback as of course I’m not in the community so wouldn’t know but anything is better then Bethesda going silent as they fuck up again.
---
It would HAVE to deliver but like others said it probably won't, for one because Bethesda has shown they have no interest to actually invest something into the game themselves for the other they've shown clearly that they would even be incapable of delivering such content simply because of lack of coding skill and lack of interest in delivering like the previous patches
---
It only gets ‘easy’ once you start buying the most expensive properties and businesses and paying the costs associated with maximising them, even then your shit could still be destroyed and hours of progress undone by some kid who decided to skip all that hassle and buy an oppressor v2 straight up.
---
In the end, it's up to you whether you think it's a good idea to spend that money, do what you think is best for you.
---
On the other hand, it is encouraging them to do more of this, in 76 and any future games they publish.  It's hard to tell you how you should feel about that, so take that into account.
---
There's no real answer, the value vs the message is a hard thing to wade through.
---
This is probably the best compromise on the issue that I've seen
---
Good that’s what happens when the support such practices.
---
The only people contributing to the death of anything in the situation you just described is Bethesda's sales and marketing department, not innocent community members. You wanna be a vain then be vain but don't stay angry at members of the community, it's not a good use of time nor energy.
---
Got. Then most likely what was mentioned as a glitch. I know they did away with purchasing. Have to find them in the real world, but if the event is not triggering when you find them then definitely another issue.
---
Something something underlying themes of extreme capitalistic.
---
The only people who will try to convince are people who don't want anyone to get it. Those who have it don't care, and those who care don't have it. But tbh you're probably not the only one sitting on the fence
---
In a camp this seems to be the case. There’s two different ones and you can do one of each. Never had a reason to try one in a workshop. Dunno why it would allow multiples there.
---
Can't say I've seen this. Mostly nice people in my server.
---
Yep. They sell in game currency which is easy to get. Bethesda on the other hand causes issues and then makes you pay to fix them. 
---
The original model for microtransactions in 76 isn't really bad. Sure, it's overpriced, but it was cosmetic only like they promised and wasn't necessary. Then they started going back on their promise and started releasing repair kits and other stuff. Then we got Fallout 1st which is a subscription fee to get around the fact that the game is a laggy mess. They also lied about the stash limit causing performance issues. 
---
Rockstar doesn't lie to their customers to make money. They don't lock fixes to their game behind a paywall.
---
Yeah, it's not pay to win, its just "pay to play the game without bugs or lag or anything of that nature and get more stuff than everyone else then jump back into Adventure mode and presumably lag everyone to shit because of your infinite junk box size". Fallout 1% dont care about us 99% lol
---
That's actually him the Rejected cartoons of Don Hertzfeldt from 2000.
---
Does it give possum badges?
---
Seems to me like it's been about a 10% chance, give or take, when it works at all.
---
I've gotten 1 badge since they fixed it, though I haven't really done a lot of events.
---
I used to not mind if they had a fee for private servers but at this point it should just be free. They can lie all they want about their plans and what they’ve said blah blah blah. But offline play/private servers and mods were all told to be coming in the future, they SHOULD have been here from the start (maybe not mods) for free but instead they are using it to take more money from their declining fan base. It’s scummy there’s no way around what they’ve done.
---
What's with the uptick in posts defending Bethesda recently? They have essentially proven to their loyal base that they have no issue scamming them, from the bullshit lies about no monetization to the canvas bags bait and switch to the Nuka rum bait-and-switch, etc, I could seriously go on and I actually have in recent comments if you want to read a laundry list of the ways Bethesda has screwed over their fan base with this game.
---
Do I enjoy the game? Yeah, I love it, but my blind loyalty to Bethesda ended the moment their loyalty to their fans ended. They are putting profits over quality and scamming people with stupid money grabs, and over pricing the stuff they do charge for.
---
With ESO, at least I got some awesome stuff with my subscription as well as access to tons of content. But that's not even Bethesda it's Zenimax. Every single thing that you have to buy in Fallout 76 is either so poorly executed that it's a joke, or it's something that should have been in the game to begin with and they are charging for it as a money grab. So yeah, I understand why people get pissed over the little things, there have been so many big things that Bethesda has basically ruined any good will their fanbase had toward them.
---
I didn't even see you type -3 Dog lol
---
Lots of people say it does. I don't think Beth ever said yes or no. Never saw any extensive experiment to test it. I equip scrapper myself. It seems to help me.
---
Not sure what you mean or what to look up? I’ve played my fair share of ESO since it’s launch. Once they dropped the general subscription from the game and added an optional one I didn’t see too much of a problem because the game  essentially stayed the same and ESO Plus offers a lot more than Fallout 1st. I look at it this way, if I wanted to play the ESO DLC, I can just spend money on the sub for a month, play through it, and then unsub. I got my experience AND I got some crowns while I’m at it. It seems like the commodity in the long run can be worth it to a lot of people. Feel free to disagree I’m just hoping you can elaborate on how you feel.
---
Used/suppose to have a chance.. seems I seen 20-25% chance somewhere..
---
I think I'm leaning towards not subscribing for the very reason that the more people who subscribe, the more likely they are to continue doing this kind of stuff, and I definitely don't want that. But as mentioned, the benefits are alluring. I think I'll at least wait until Wastelanders and see how that plays out.
---
Looks just like Saladfingers haha neat
---
Will Passive mode be able to stop this?
---
Or will you die in Passive as well?
---
Lol. I really cant tell if this is a serious post, or expertly written satire. The vast majority of those ideas would not go over well with non subscribers. I honestly think FO1 is well worth what im paying for it. And once mod support comes out, its only going to get better. I say leave it as is.
---
Breh. I dont care what beth wants. I care about what I want. Hence why I spent my money. If I gave a damn what game producers did, I wouldnt be playing games anymore.
---
Its the Fallout 1% vs the "free content" 99%, good times
---
All you gotta do is do heists until you get enough for Import/Export and then it's smooth sailing. Hours of work? Do you steal supplies for businesses? That's less profitable then just buying them because in the time it takes to steal all of those you could sell multiple cars.
---
Nothing stops it. You will die either way.
---
Oh, I'll try to do some scouts quests, does it works with ALL scouts quests?
---
&gt; You’re talking about the spec requirements for the client. The server doesn’t need to handle any video, audio, animations, etc.
---
Yes, but we're talking about a development team that has no actual experience with multiplayer. Additionally just because an animation isn't visible doesn't mean the server doesn't need it being processed. One important thing to keep in mind about Fallout is that it supports hitting different body parts for different effects. If I try to make a headshot but the head is in a certain position because of an animation how would the server know if it wasn't likewise playing through that animation?
---
Yup £13 a month for a private server how greedy , not like that price is very similar to other popular games !
---
That’s crazy...
---
I’ll have to get me some nuke mines lmao
---
Guessing Zenimax is a public company on the stock exchange. Their number 1 priority is to make a profit for their shareholders. 
---
If everyone stopped playing, the game would just be cut &amp; they would move onto something else. They wouldn't make fallout 1st free as then they would have to do refunds &amp; also lose ongoing revenue. It can be made fairer, but it's here to stay.
---
Unfortunately all business is done this way. I've lost my job 3 times because a company wanted to maximise a profit, so they slashed staff levels. 3 times that company was still making a profit &amp; in one of the cases over 1000 people were let go. It's unfortunately part of life, companies are greedy &amp; that's not going to change. 
---
I actually think fallout 1st is decent value, so that's why I got it.
---
Times are a changing, not much we can do to stop it.
---
democracy is a government, capitalism is the economy which allows for this type of money grabbing bullshit, splitting us into classses and things of that nature.
---
That's fair enough. Appreciate the input, mate
---
It only really kills bloodied builds. At full health you're not going to die from the first mine.
---
Personal choice. I refuse to give Bethesda any more $$ on principle. 
---
I don't want them thinking that turning their games into "membership based" is a good idea. This includes using real money in the Atomic Shop.
---
For us that paid over and above the price of the base game on release and on preorder, this should have been given to us as an apology for the absolute farce this game launch was and for us sticking it out.
---
If it will suit your needs then go for it. You will be happier.
---
What? There's nothing normal about this lol? Everyone already paid hello? Why would I need to come up with my own online game?? And the vast majority of people are smart enough to not pay beth? Hence the gigantic public backlash that's made mainstream news? Did you just crawl out from under a rock?? Lmao
---
Nice, I have both kinds of fog machines. Can I put down double the amount? That's actually really neat. Can I vats out of them if they can't vats in?
---
Stay there please, do us all a favor, no one wants you or your infinite scrap ruining the last semblance of economy this game had
---
Bethesda.net **official** forums contain most of community that they listen to. Reddit isn’t too priority for input as it’s has become a place to rant
---
You are a good person.
---
where is your sources?
---
Stings and things gives possum badges, the tidy one gives tadpole badges
---
Wether you subscribe or not, they will continue with their practice just the same. 
---
So do you think 1600 Atoms, a private server, infinite scrap and the best outfit in Fallout NV is worth $17 a month?
---
If you answered yes, buy it.
---
If not don’t.
---
You can also get a month to try it and see if it is really worth it
---
No, why? I consider F76 as a single-player game. There's not much to do with other players here except for killing SBQs. But it's boring as hell and has no sense, frankly speaking, cause you waste a lot of ammo for some questionable loot which is not worth it in like 90% case. Or even more. But even so, the main issue with that is it's boring. You just stand there, press a single button and waste your ammo on a big target. Very fun :) That's why I grabbed a camera and took a few photos during that fight :)   
---
But I more or less enjoyed completing quests and reading stories found in Appalachia. Some of them were really good, funny, tragic but very plausible.   
---
Main quest line was like a goal for me, but once it's done (with side line quests as well) I don't know what to do there. Events? Boring. Nukes? Fighting through all that robots for an hour just for waste a lot of ammo for another SBQ? Not worth it, especially time spent on clearing the bunker. What's left? Building a CAMP? Yeah, that's where the greatest joke is. While there is a lot of stuff you can build, with current build limit it makes no sense at all. Plus an old bug when you can't move your camp if you have some kind of a balcony (and items you place on such floor considered as "floating"). But it's the build limit that kills the idea of building itself. It has to be like x5 from what it is now, so people can let their imagination go. At the current state, it's crippled as hell.  
---
So, summing it up, there's not much to do with quests finished but events, building is very limited, interaction with other players is not needed at all, launching nukes makes no sense. I won't mention random bugs, that's minor compared to all this. That's why I'm happy I got a good end-of-story picture, it will remind me about good side of the game :)
---
If this is what it takes to seed class consciousness I’ll take it
---
Please no, too many cheaters on PC. You don't want that toxicity invading consoles.
---
A premium service is normal. You pay for premium services. You get benefits plus extra that the ones that dont pay do not get. It's the same concept of most online games. Now, Did you just crawl from under a rock?
---
If people think it's okay to harass others for buying into Fallout 1st... does that go for EVERY time someone spends extra money on the game?
---
If someone buys one of those time limited atom bundles they're spending $9.99 to get 1500 atoms and an exclusive costume... and people buying Fallout 1st are paying $12.99 to get 1650 atoms, a costume and all of the other extras.
---
Is anyone allowed to spend money on the game?  
---
Should we round up a posse and go from camp to camp and judge whether someone has too many fancy decorations up and must have bought some atoms on the side?
---
*prostrates and grovels* What shall I do to stay their wrath? Will a shrine to Mr. Pebbles be enough?
---
I’ve tossed all of mine and I’m hoping I get it when I pick up a new one
---
It annoys me soooooo much when people sell shit at the base price. Why would I even buy said item from you when I could just buy it from a robot vendor for the same price?
---
??? Bethesda isn’t listening and they won’t respond. They dropped a note about “fixing” their broken shitty service instead of address the backlash, Pete Hines has been off Twitter for days. It’s time to nuke em all, get a response.
---
&gt; But you know you still have to invest the same amount of game play collecting that junk, right? It's just in a single chunk of time, rather than staggered resource collection.
---
No, because you can easily collect more than you can store. If you want to store more, you have to dump legendary weapons and armor you might want to keep.
---
Ok, got it, thanks.
---
...he said before brazilians who bought the game on deep discount invaded the servers and ate him as well.
---
No problem! Let me know if you get a possum badge! Ha!
---
Already been fixed
---
I believe I read they did a Hotfix yesterday to correct the junk issue..... thanks for the update....
---
RDO did the same battle pass where you could get the next one for free. It’s really smart because most people aren’t gonna keep that currency for the next Pass with the other shop items available, so what happens when the next time rolls around? They purchase it. It just works
---
Same with nuka nades. Shut the door and toss in nade or two. Bloodied players get stuck in menus and cant get out.
---
I take it back. Read it a second time for shits and gigs. Im seriously crying laughing at this point. Great work. Take my upvote!
---
I've gotten probably 8 possum badges from stings n things in the last month. Just sold 8 and sitting back at 6
---
Are they hiring?
---
Good luck. Starting fresh can not hurt.
---
Wanna know how they were able to keep GTAO running?
---
P2P servers (they cost nothing on Rockstar's part, but are horrible for competitive gameplay), shark cards, and unbalanced items that are ridiculously overpriced to push players to buy shark cards.
---
GTAO also has its share of bugs in the form of exploits that virtually ruin free roam for everyone, and Rockstar doesn't seem to give a damn unless it helps people earn money.
---
Another thing is that Rockstar is now double-dipping PC fans by delaying PC releases so that they are forced to buy console versions to play.
---
Just block every d-bag that acts like a child and then hop to another server.
---
A Bethesda Dev conformed a 25% badge drop rate.
---
That's why I was asking actually 😂
---
Do you keep the NCR outfit even if you cancel the subscription?
---
Dont stop talking about outer worlds either.
---
They dont lie, they just blatantly sell actual pay to win.
---
Easier said than done my friend
---
What else is left to do in the game?
---
I've bought the $10 atoms a few times and I don't think people have a problem with the private servers or subscriptions. People are furious about the unlimited scrap stash. That was a big no-no! They lied about server issues with too much junk and now it's behind a paywall
---
That's what I did. Just to see how it is. No great thing. You actually begin to miss the random players and jumping from camp to camp.
---
Because whales are easily addicted...so long as they have non whales to grief.
---
Would it though?  How many atoms do you have saved up?  I have well over 15000 at this point and I'm not even doing all of my challenges that often.  People playing this game are so cheap that they don't even spend the free atoms they get playing the game, so when something fancy like this comes out that Bethesda is hoping will make them actual money they end up making squat because most players just use their free atoms.
---
Eat the rich!
---
No thanks. I'll just play ESO for the next few months while I wait for Wastelanders
---
It was actually.
---
One doesn't kill me but multiples def do. My level 350 is a bloody build but I only use him for storage. Every time I'm on someone gets me with mines. Usually they drop more than one. Just find it weird. I never have any junk on him so whateves lol.
---
You’ve given me a reason to play again thank you
---
Oh yeah that’s right Bethesda found away to monetize mods again
---
&gt;I feel bad for Bethesda
---
Honestly I do too. I strongly suspect while we're all shaking our fists at Todd and Bethesda, it's actually Zenimax who's being the complete and utter shits. Who can really tell for sure, but that's my suspicion. 
---
I didn't buy 76 and there's no way I'd subscribe for more on top of that, but I'm glad you are enjoying it, it's clear that some people somewhere have worked very hard on certain aspects of it.
---
Why? They should stay out of adventure if They have their own world. I say attack and make them leave. :)
---
Do it and then add me so that can play assuming yer on Xbox
---
Thanks! Must just be my shitty luck then! It seemed to jive with the purveyor sale update so I was wondering
---
I use the LGBT flag icon cause I support that community even though Im not gay and Ive never had a single problem because of it.
---
If you are looking for a more "FO4" experience, then the Private Server would definitely give you that mode. 
---
I think it's a slap in the face to anyone whom plays the game though. We were told "infinite Stash Boxes" would cause Server issues... uh huh... we were told, free DLC... uh huh... I bet if enough people buy into the Membership, they'll start adding tiers to that. Bronze, Silver, Gold... 
---
QoL changes should be a part of the core game updates not hid behind a paywall. You are free to spend your money how you want, I for one, will not even buy Atoms. 
---
I will not support the constant fleecing that this game seems to be attempting with the Player Base.
---
Wasn't my opinion, I was breaking it down by how English works.  And again he says content and then follows up with DLC and stuff, to be followed by cosmetics in shop, which again shows content to be strict to DLC. I mean you can try and warp his words but you literally just cemented my argument for the english comprehension of his statements.   
---
This is objective and not subjective.   
---
Now the one I will say red flags is   
---
&gt; That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free.   
---
  
---
However we look at the article as a whole and his whole speel and we find he was talking about:   
---
&gt; We give you a shitload of Atoms just for playing the game. Folks that want to spend money on whatever the hell it is because they don’t have enough Atoms, they can, but it’s not, ‘I’m now better playing against other players because I spent money.’ It’s not pay-to-win. And it’s not loot crates.”   
---
 “All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,” explains Hines; “all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.” 
---
Notice this line?   
---
&gt;all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. 
---
That would mean cosmetics are free also if we go by your logic. 
---
The whole context matters, including how everyone assumed no matter what that the atom shop would be cosmetic only. We can read in plain english how he is comparing is stance on Fallout 76 over other games at the time. He carried over from other games store fronts and the PvP advantages  they offer.   
---
Also of interest is this quote:   
---
&gt; "When we originally announced the Atomic Shop last year, we said that it will not provide anything that offers a competitive advantage. 
---
I stand by my opening statements and say they still have not crossed the line when you take it all in and look at it objectively.
---
Eh, Id say that's arguably better than intentionally making a game bad so people pay to fix it. Even then, it isnt hard to get that stuff without paying. I haven't played a dime and I've got a lot of stuff and I'm an off and on player.
---
Thanks for the info
---
I guess that's where you belong if you can't hold your own.
---
Good
---
Never
---
Personally I’m big on modding and that’s my main drive for wanting a private server. I can’t help but be pessimistic however and think any mods to 76 will have the same limitations of Fallout 4 modding on the PS4. Vanilla assets only. I have nothing to back this up but Bethesda just seems to have a bad track record to me personally.
---
Thanks for the info. So there really isn't anything one could do about it?
---
I've never actually completed a full raid. I tried it once with my girlfriend, and we got disconnected and she never wanted to try it again cuz she wasn't interested. And I tried it the other night with some fellows from Reddit oh, but I had some stuff come up me and Ray and I have to leave immediately
---
Psn tigersmhs07
---
 I'll be on on and off for the next 2 days
---
I love playing as a raider character too sometimes. Can't handle go run to your private world. Lol
---
They can vats in as long as you are standing up.
---
It will better be "hate the mechanics for letting the pass for all the dupers and exploiters"
---
&gt; Servers don’t run game engines
---
You must not have any experience with modern game engines. Unity, Unreal, and CryEngine all have a way to build binaries without the components required to handle client-side graphical and audio output. This is done because building your server with the same game engine that you build your client makes for much faster development.
---
&gt; A Fallout 76 server wouldn’t be fundamentally much different from a Minecraft server.
---
When it comes to how servers function Minecraft is very much the exception.
---
War, war never changes.
---
Got one 2 days ago and 12 so far since update, I’ve had something happens every few days where when i complete “stings and things” and jump servers, it pops up again 🤷🏽‍♂️ I’ll pray to RNGsus for you 🙏🏼
---
Yea. I definitely think the creation club is going to show its ugly face at some point. Lets just hope its not a monthly fee per mod. Lol
---
Players are going to take what they can get. Always have since reclamation day.
---
You're just a shill for Bethesda at this point bro
---
I mean they already paid for the game... Throwing it in the trash won't change anything
---
Be aware of your surroundings
---
Why? Because I have a point?
---
Nah the Cc isn’t gonna happen because you are already paying a monthly fee for private servers
---
I think it is borderline criminal what Bethesda has done with this game and personally I would never give money to support such a corporation. But it's your choice... Is it really worth it though? And what's next? As long as people are paying they'll just keep doing this sort of crap.
---
$18 for fucking BLUE!!!!!
---
People aren't "cheap" they just don't release anything that people want to buy. And I've no idea how many atoms I have because I haven't touched the game in about a month and uninstalled it yesterday. When the Liberty prime power armor skin was being sold I saw so many people with it, why? Because it was actually a pretty cool skin. They can easily monetize the game if they were to sell things people actually want they just refuse to do so or have them locked behind a paywall such as a monthly/yearly subscription or make things 18$ worth of atoms. Don't blame the players and call them "cheap" because this is obviously them being greedy.
---
Passive does nothing to stop others from attacking you.  It just makes you well...passive.
---
This shit is turning into fallout: civil war
---
I don’t like when you buy a new one it auto-equips that one. I grab any that are free but I don’t always want to use it right away.
---
Oh so you are just a fool, ok. I can see there will be no having a conversation with you. Good by
---
I try but I've never actually seen them on the map or when I was at the bench. Hard to know when they get ya lol. Then the disappear.
---
Hypocrisy? 3000 for a tse handmade, that's a steal. What does that have anything to do with Fallout 1st?
---
Exactly it feels like brotherhood hasn't got a lot of love in this game even though they painstakingly make sure they were in the game
---
And you're wrong. But I sure will.
---
How?
---
Its absurd that anyone who plays fallout 76 would be mad about fallout 1st at this point - the reason why they think they can do this and make money off of it is because anyone still playing this heap will tolerate anything.
---
Look at it this way. If you have or agree with atom shop from the start then this is a good deal. Honestly it's a step in the right direction! Bare with me, if it's a huge money grab then why would they give more for 12$ then a prior patch 12$  would get you? Before "if" you were going to spend$$ 10 would get 1000 atoms. Well 12 now gets 1600 and way more! So look at it this way, it's a service for paying customers a "premium service or version". Not a have to sub or can't play. They took nothing, and  gave better value. ALOT of companies do this, and we should not be surprised that any company caters to higher paying customers. It's been that way in and out of the gaming industry for years. This is a ZENIMAX move. It's how most MMO companies with a free to play model operate.
---
In the end the choice is yours
---
That's precisely my concern and is why I'm leaning towards refraining from subscription, at least until I see whether Wastelanders is successful or not
---
Exactamundo. I personally won’t judge someone for buying the subscription, but at the same time I think keeping the QoL changes behind a paywall is scummy on Bethesda’s part.
---
That place is constantly full of Bravos and their minions.  I tried to do the daily of giving Jack pumpkins and ended up fighting off two legendary Bravos.  The night before it was 2 Bravos and a Mothman.  Epic battles for sure, but I died twice until I remembered that I crafted a set of Ultracite PA.  After equipping it I was nice and comfy.  Now that the Bravos are legendary, they have been dropping plans for Prime receivers, not just the usual junk so I have been farming over there. One at a time is definitely easier.  The Bravos stay away from the Pumpkin House though.  One of those pink alien things was there sniping at the Bravo from in front of the house, and the Bravo turned pink, but did not attack.  It is neat to be experiencing these places at the same time my kids are going to haunted houses and pumpkin patches.
---
Listen very carefully, because I'm so fucking tired of explaining this.
---
What people have always asked for has never been infinite scrap storage, it's been infinite stash space.  These two things are EXTREMELY different.  Scrap storage is simple, when you open that container all the game has to load up is at most 33 item id's for each basic type of scrap and the values for how many you have of each.  Could they have added this as a feature for everyone?  Yes.  Should they have?  Fuck no.  This is supposed to be a Fallout themed survival game, having infinite anything in a survival game is a recipe to trivialize major mechanics.
---
Infinite stash space however needs to be able to handle way more than just thirty three entries.  Every possible piece of junk, every consumable, every chem, every type of ammo, every individual hat, outfit, and every single unique piece of armor and weapon... all getting loaded up to display at once.  That's why we have a limit to stash weight, because it acts as a soft cap on how many item id's the server has to send the game client every single time you and everyone else opens up their stash.
---
Bethesda didn't lie about shit, there are still basic technical limitations on how much data they can relay and display without having it affect server stability.
---
I sure hope the mods a free. Im not holding my breath though.
---
&gt; Obsidian has very limited funding
---
Now they've got the MS bucks. Funding is not a problem, I imagine.
---
Nuclear Winter's quite good.  Honestly, I can't take adventure mode pvp seriously whatwith everyone crutching on vats.
---
Key point, knowing full well it’s been duped. Taking advantage of an exploit for personal gain. Who hasn’t done this?
---
...What does a mediocre handmade that only has 2 shot have anything to do with a 12.99/month 99.99/year subscription? I'm genuinely confused about this comparison.
---
You do realize that you also get like 15 bucks worth of Atoms with your sub each month it’s a wash.
---
So if you have Atoms and buy the sub you actually gain Atom back unless they make it higher than 1600.
---
im not into this first thing but I also hate this frustration on players that chose to buy.   At least  their money is gonna support the servers.  I dont think farming for atoms ingame is gonna help keep servers up.  I get it if this is not the idea people were looking for doesnt mean frustrations should be aimed toward the willing.
---
Do you all read your own posts? You're condoning bullying, griefing and harassing players, real life people, because you're upset with the company??? At the very least, like the OP, you think it's funny. The definition of being a bully. 
---
You all need to just step back and snap out of the mob mentality you've fallen into. This is just repugnant.
---
I can confirm this... two guys came to my camp saw I was a first member and immediately start destroying my camp I just sever hopped it but seriously that's petty
---
Outerworlds over fallout.
---
If the "whaaaaambulance" can come up with a better argument, by all means.
---
I had that happen a few weeks ago also. I do in one day like 2-3 times
---
Seems like complaining is the main hobby of gaming hobbyists.
---
Yeah I think it’s great and don’t worry most of the stems from Reddit and YouTube ... most everyone  I have grouped with or did an event with don’t really care.
---
So you're saying buying a product does not encourage the seller to continue selling that product?
---
It was in PC gamer
---
I had linked the article the day that patch went live, but as the day went on PC gamer updated that article so the old info was gone. 
---
Here’s what I had: [https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk](https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk) from a google search and getting it to give me the snippet from the article 
---
Of course, Pete Hines has a number of deleted tweets as well, so it’s hard to pinpoint the exact quote.  But none the less, it was said at some point by oct of last year it would have a cost
---
Forever alone.
---
Go ahead have fun with your dead and looted NPCs and disappearing stash. No ones stopping you Bethesda shill.
---
Democracy is when the people choose who is in power. And the people have spoken...
---
Good theyre ruining fallout by promoting bethasdas bullshit
---
Turn down useless sounds and max out footsteps. Dont trust anyone either lol
---
Eh. I think it's worth it for the atoms alone, but if you're only interested in the private servers imo you should see if you've got anyone in your friends list who has it that'll let you play in theirs for a bit first.
---
You're insisting that ALL Bethesda has to do to get people to spend money on this game is release things people actually want... so they released stuff people wanted with Fallout 1st and everyone said "Yay, the thing we always wanted!  Have all my money!"...  No... everyone freaked the fuck out and demanded that they should have all of those things right now and for free.
---
Yeah a premium service is normal, for a premium games with 100s of hours of content with that service such as an MMO. This is a shitty poorly made generic semi survival multiplayer game. It's not a game you make a subscription for and if you do you don't price it the same as a fucking WoW sub lmao it's insane. The fallout fuckyou 1st pass is outrageous and if given any support will push gaming further down the black hole its working its way into right now. 
---
So again, have fun paying your premium service fee just to get past the start menu of future games because if this takes off thats where we're headed.
---
Good, fuck anyone making this trash pile of a release any money.
---
Has there not been several free game modes and free events everyone can play?  I don’t understand the anger toward rewarding those who want to pay for it. No one is forcing anyone to buy anything once you buy the game. I’ve leveled up 3 dif characters to over level 150 each and never had to buy a single thing. 
---
The private servers are a fun way to play the game with friends without the constant harassment of someone wanting to pvp, doing events without someone one-shotting everything and you get nothing, taking over workshops and getting more loot than you can imagine. 
---
I’m happy to pay $100 for a private server to join with my friends and continue to enjoy the game. 
---
Everyone posting about the game, good or bad, is more free press you’re giving them. If you want to hurt them, uninstall it. Stop posting about it and move on.
---
These "private" servers aren't constantly running like other servers that people actually pay for on games like Ark, Conan Exiles or even Minecraft. They're literally just paid for adventure servers. When you leave the server after about 10 minutes they go down, this doesn't cost them more money than it does to run an adventure mode server.
---
Imagine wasting money on Fallout 76. What a joke.
---
I don't mind the reflex sight, but they need to fix the aforemention
---
Yes, I was thinking on your point a min ago and realized I misunderstood you lol
---
Machine gun turrets fire at about 30-40 metres, definitely not only once they’re real close. I agree they do stupid low damage.
---
I kinda like the unexpected danger.
---
The amount of those people complaining about Fallout 1st not being worth $100 a year and spending four times that on cigarettes and liquor per month is really sad.
---
If it's for sale it doesn't mean it's duped, for 3000 I would assume the person isn't too bright, not that they duped it. What's hypocritical about fallout 1st and people who don't support it tho?
---
The issue is that Super Mutants and Scorched won't get close at that distance. They will keep firing at sniper range.
---
How, precisely, is it not like that?
---
Yea I know. 
---
I just wasnt sure about the rads
---
Yea. Agreed. NW has been a lot of fun. Didnt really like the Forrest map, but the morgantown map is pretty great. A lot of diversity in terrain. And vats definitely kills the pvp experience in adventure. Im hopping when mods come out for private servers, they allow us to change aspects like this. Really want to create a pvp world, no vats or legendaries. Basically NW but on the whole map. Add in some fort building, tribes/clans, and armor/weapon crafting. I think itd be a fun time.
---
We do hate the game thats the problem.
---
Angry Joe did this on his rant about fallout first, granted he had some good points and dont support what Bethesda has done with fallout first but he kept showing launch footage from when he originally reviewed the game. It has stabilized a lot since launch, still not where it should be but showing old launch footage just seemed lazy and made his points less valid.
---
Personally I dont get the hate because really it comes down to the private servers being 13 dollars a lot of games do this so I dont get what people hate about this honestly its. Cheaper than other games and has extra stuff to go with it.
---
So some headwear gives you airborne disease immunity even if it doesn't say so?
---
Running with your point on companions, how about a new 'Steamy Appalachian Nights' bundle? Two tiered, of course: free to First members, 1500 Atoms for everyone else. 
---
Subscribers get the opportunity to romance a bevy of hot new (totally customisable) NPCs. They can go for as many as they like, whenever they like, wherever they like. Non-subscribers don't have quite so much choice. In fact they have no choice at all. Just constant access to a one-night stand with Preston Garvey's great great great grandfather on a damp sleeping bag in the Mire. Daily. Repeatable. Mandatory. He pops up every time you log in, like Grafton's mayor. To round off the experience, non-subscribers get the plans for a brand 'spanking' new outfit (10 rubber, 5 leather). It will cause them a small amount of damage as they walk (chafing), is horribly unflattering, and they won't be able to remove it from their inventories.
---
Back at CAMP, First members can build their very own erotic memory den, permanently set to 'whatever floats your boat'. Non-subscribers get a den too, but theirs can only play 'that one night with Preston Garvey's great great great grandfather' over and over on a loop. And the volume is a bit too loud.
---
And the tent
---
Which then all id ask for is that it forces it into move position to do it. Its almost a punishment for getting a skin otherwise. I have no problem storing other items to change their functionality. But i have 4 vendors and that would be 120 items picked up,resorted and repriced items. Not the worst 15 minutes of my life but could easily be avoided and with holiday themed items it would be a recurring time waster/punishment.
---
But he's referring to the democracy within the community of fallout. And I can agree with him. This is so amazing I'm dying. But like all others on here I feel for both sides. I feel sorry that it's happening but it is and I'm one against what bethesda has become and it time to cleanse Appalachia and its about time we put it in a way ppl understand.
---
I'm insisting that they release **cosmetic** skins that people actually want and maybe they would make enough money. Not QoL/Utility items that we've suggested just for them to sell to us. Your argument doesn't make any sense, it's almost like you didn't read anything I've typed up there... But continue throwing money at them it's not my problem what you do with your money, I'm pretty sure the game will be dead within a year or maybe less sadly.
---
Yes.
---
It might be mediocre to you now but it wasn’t always that way. Here’s the point. In This community absolutely no one is innocent of exploits for gain. Those cheap 2 tse weapons we were buying in February? we knew what was up. To hate on players buying this subscription is a bit hypocritical because they’re doing nothing different than what all of us have been doing since launch. 
---
Taking advantage of a broken game
---
Lol attack!
---
Thanks for the quick answer!
---
Bothering people for spending their own damn money? I ain't gonna judge people, do whatever the hell you want. People buy 20$ skins on fortnite daily, it's their money. I bought Destiny 1 over 3 damn times just to access things that were locked behind a pay wall after dlcs, then bought d2. So whose the clown here. 
---
Use this energy to change real world problems.
---
How do you not see that it's wrong? Lol 1st players storage just dropped 500+ lbs with the scrap box. That shouldn't be behind a paywall.
---
Last question... Do they get caps for killing me. It happens so fast I never pay attention lol
---
It's amazing how many people want to blame Todd and Pete for everything.
---
What a bunch of dicks
---
No I should be apologizing for you having terrible discipline and supporting such a shitty company and practice. They’re fucking you in the ass and you’re paying them for it. Pathetic.
---
Yup, be they have to be on the server &amp; when the 1st owner leaves and nobody else is a member you will get a warning saying the server is shutting down though
---
I'm saying I don't give a shit what people do with their money. My life is so much happier that way.
---
Indeed. If you buy it at least once and spend a few weeks grinding, you will never have to pay again.
---
Same with LotRO and Albion Online. You can easily earn RM currency in game and use it to buy membership. That's how it should be here as well. 
---
I subscribe to both LotRO and AO, but haven't paid real money for either in quite a while. Well over 6 years for Lord of the Rings Online. Possibly longer.
---
You get 30 minutes
---
Toss in and THEN shut the door.  I’ve, uh, heard that’s how it’s done.
---
Buying Fallout 1st isn't us taking advantage of a broken game, it's them taking advantage of their loyal and gullible fanbase. Your comparisons literally make no sense, there's no way to tell if an item has been duped on this game or not so you can't really call someone a hypocrite for being smart enough to not want to be scammed.
---
Thanks for the info this makes me feel a lot better cause I can test the waters on another friends world now, as well as farm workshops haha
---
120 hours?!ou are a bloody masochist, why would you do that to yourself?!
---
Ah thank you! I didn’t know that :)
---
I don't blame them
---
I do when it affects me.
---
I thought it would be more probable that the only people playing still would have the icons...
---
This is a conversation about player choice. No one is innocent in that department
---
Landed on a server where a player named erdogan was being griefed over and over.  Fallout 1st players are probably griefed just a bit less.
---
March towards the cleansing of Appalachia brethren! Ill see you purifying lands
---
Yah specially those bloody Raiders.... hahaha
---
🙈🙉🙊
---
Unless you’re new to the game you can tell when there is something up with a person’s inventory and item selection
---
I don't hate the game, and that's what bugs me, because I know I shouldn't play (and I won't), because it just encourages Bethesda to keep doing this shit. I enjoyed the game, but I can't keep playing and feel good about it. At some point, we need to let companies know what they're doing is wrong.
---
So you can tell an item is duped that's being sold in a player's vendor when there's only one of them?
---
" \[Fallout creator\] Todd Howard " rofl 😒
---
Criminal charges, absolutely.
---
Shouldn't be something you can use to deflect criticism though.
---
And exactly how many cosmetics do you expect people to buy?  Like I said I have well over 15000 atoms from not even trying, even at Bethesda's stupid prices I would have to by almost TWENTY outfits right now just to run out and start spending actual money in the atom shop.  Even if we bump it up to something more expensive I would still be buying a dozen bundles or sets of PA paint jobs.  Like you said Bethesda went and released that awesome Liberty Prime PA paint and so many people bought it... well odds are they bought it with their free atoms and Bethesda didn't make jack shit off of their effort.
---
Just dont like dealing with hackers/cheaters overall toxic people
---
Believe what you want man. I asked a simple question, wondering how people can want to play a game with the shit they're pulling, and you decided I'm trolling or whatever.
---
as theses are starting to die off slowly we'll see lots of posts in the opposite targeting "salty they are salty", better treat both the same IMO.
---
Okay, you're being ridiculous. OP might be exaggerating, but I can almost guarantee they probably did actually see players griefing Fallout 1st members. It's not far-fetched in the least and you know it.
---
Most people are quite lucky though cause for me it’s going to cost either $23 a month or $189 a year which is a lot
---
Thanks for not assuming I'm being an asshole like some of these others. I appreciate your answer to my question
---
Ok. Cool story bro.  Too bad it doesn't.
---
I would assume the duped ones are all on Ebay. The legit ones sell cheap from normal players that don't know players are willing to pay more
---
If you can't afford it, you could find a friend that is willing to share their private world with you. I have a couple and I haven't been on public servers ever since private worlds have been released even though I haven't subscribed to a membership.
---
^🔥
---
Pete is literally in charge of marketing and PR. He's the one who comes up with a lot of the bullshit we suffer through. Marketing people lie. It's their job to lie. It's one of the sleaziest jobs on Earth.
---
I'll let the legend Bill Hicks explain how marketing works:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEOGrkhDp0
---
Like I said in my initial post, I have no problem with paying for private servers hosting on Bethesda’s end. I understand free events have been added, and that’s good because that’s what’s been stated they will do. My main gripe is the addition of QoL improvements at the cost of real-world money when they should have been  made free for a Fully-priced game, and it is something they have explicitly stated they would not do. 
---
Your idea about posting about the game is just free press is kinda correct I guess? But I don’t think the “bad press is still press” really works because Fallout 76 would have sold like hot cakes otherwise. I’ll continue to play if I still see the fun in playing. They already got my money, so uninstalling wouldn’t really do much. And I’m sure you can imagine I feel I have a right to discuss how I feel about a game’s direction in a subreddit dedicated to said game?
---
They were right here tho. Capitalism is to blame
---
This is a problem I have too! Also high level enemies take out all my turrets with ease. But I definitely think the range should be addressed
---
Do I need to explain it again? It does because buying it encourages Bethesda to continue putting stuff behind a paywall. There you go.
---
No, just ugly america themed shit
---
Magic
---
Absolutely. Attacking users is the same, no matter the side you’re on.
---
This is imcredible
---
It's the same thing with game sales as well, the numerical price is usually identical, even if the value cost is usually a hell of a lot more!
---
Have you never come across a player selling items and it wasn’t completely obvious they had a duped inventory?
---
The estimate (for the US, which isn't exactly a leader in acceptance) is somewhere between 3 and 7 percent. The people within the company deciding to do something with it probably do care about it, the games industry isn't exactly a conservative place.
---
The problem is BGS tells lies and contradicts themselves that proves they lied at every turn, nothing they do or say is trustworthy...but trust they are going to nickel and dime everyone for what's left of the lifespan of the game because idiots keep giving them money for nothing essentially.
---
If Marx were in charge, we would’ve got Fallout 5, not this 😔
---
I just use nukacrypt. I’ve only ever had one code at a time. You definitely don’t need the code pieces. The site you used might’ve had the wrong code
---
You're making the assumption **everyone** sells duped items which isn't true.
---
It's better for almost all players... But people STILL think they might get single player from this. I can't fathom why even bothering with a MP game if thats your aim. But sometimes people dont think very clearly.
---
People join up all the time and most say... "YouTube lied to me" yep.
---
Legit though, you are part of the problem. You are the one that is allowing games to do this too us. You must have seen the reaction from the player base and gaming community in general and went "yeah, ill give it a go, why not, cant hurt". At the end of the day, consumers have the power. If we stop buying this shit, they will soon forget about it even attempting to dish it out to us. If ppl like you just give it a try, it justifies their shitty business decisions..... Gamers that just want games to be made properly again, aren't going to get their wishes til people like you stop falling for their rubbish. Please use your noggin.
---
Thing is that if you wish you can spend money on warframe to buy cosmetics as well as the warframes and weapons themselves instead of grinding, people dont make a fuz about it becouse pvp in warframe is meh and almost nobody cares about it and if someone spends all their money gettin prime frames its actually beneficial for everyone on the team.
---
This paid benefits are entirely optional and in my opinion the benefits from warframes seems extremely more “p2w” that that of fo76. 
---
One thing i dont know tho is that if the company behind warframe digital extremes has to respond to a parent company in terms of revenue. If they dont then it means there is no parent company placing a rope on their necks pressuring them to milk money.
---
Not really defending or attacking any company as i love both games , just expressing my opinion
---
Those who have played this game a while and I’m assuming that’s most of us, have taken full advantage of exploits we knew were exploits. So why are we hating on players for doing the exact same thing in many respects?
---
I'm about that level now (of the high levels), I should probably start doing this
---
Its all just a vault-tec experiment.
---
Where's that, I thought Australia was bad at $180 are you in NZ.
---
Salty?
---
My first experience with a battle pass was in Destiny 2 and I really enjoyed it. I heard Fortnite's is pretty good too. Wouldn't mind something like that in 76 instead of a subscription.
---
Yup bang on the dot, really sucks
---
Do you carry 500lbs of scrap on your stash?  I'm a recovering hoarder with well over 300 ballistic fiber among all of my other piles of  crap and I'm only holding about 120lbs of scrap tops.  
---
No one ever needs that much scrap, and even when you DO need bulk amounts of scrap to do something you don't need to run to an infinite scrap box when you can just farm up the majority of materials in ridiculous amounts in no time at all just by killing the right enemies.  
---
The only people that think this scrap box actually matters are the psychopaths running around with Pack Rat and thousands of scrap at all times. Months back I Actually got into an argument with someone who was arguing that we needed more/infinite stash space because they were tired of carrying around the FIVE THOUSAND steel they had in their inventory.
---
Guess you are lucky.
---
Thats why i troll people at queen battle just stand on the fence dancing away.
---
sigh...
---
It’s a very loud minority. Many of them probably don’t even play the game any more - evidenced by comments that indicate they are not played in a long time. (referencing mechanics and bugs that were changed/fixed long ago)
---
Facts are, content was added for free. Arktos. Burrows. Value Raids. Tons of Atom shop items which can be earned with game time and don’t have to be bought. 
---
I remember in 1998 a new N64 game was 60$. Now in 2018 a new game is still 60$. The price point hasn’t changed despite the inflation rate making 60$ in 1998 the same as about 95$ in 2018. Is this justification for subscription? Maybe, maybe not. That’s subjective. I personally feel that the option to run a private server is worth the 8$ (or 13$ if you go month to month) well worth it. The rest is just bonus content. 
---
Should the Scrapbox be locked behind a paywall? Can’t really say. I bought the sub. However, no content was removed and nothing was taken away from those that didn’t pay. They still have the same game they bought before. Therefore, I feel like the complaints are unwarranted and rooted in today’s entitlement and instant gratification society. 
---
I’ve read an absurd amount of angry posts and trolled most of them, so anyone thinking about commenting about what Todd said or why they deserve the content for free or how terrible of a human I am for ‘enabling’ this may as well save it. I don’t care about your feelings and enjoy the envy based hate. 8$ a month or 13$ a month is not even targeting the ‘whales’. That’s chump change, not whale money. Developers and publishers are not charities nor not for profit organizations. If you don’t think it’s worth it, that’s fine. Don’t buy it. But don’t demand it for free, or that just proves that you want it you just don’t want to pay for it.
---
I did the same, I’m on PC. No one has bothered me, of course after my scrapbox ate all my scrap I stopped playing lol glad I only wanted a single month to try it.
---
I had this problem too. I believe there is no way around it. In other words, you're screwed. They're all useless. When you pick one up you get the quest and you can turn in 1 each time you have that quest. So if you have it, then 69 of those are useless. If you don't have it then all 70 are trash
---
Pure Disney's classic magic
---
Good. Anyone supporting this stupid pay2win policy deserves to be bullied.
---
Did this just turn into the purge?
---
No I’m not, but many months ago many were. And almost everyone bought them
---
No in australia it’s 180 fucking dollars which is absolute insanity
---
Were their name's Texas Red?
---
I dont think turrets shoot outside of the camp circle. Have mutants hid by trees less then 5m away but my turrets wont shoot them unless one runs up. I just got rid of the turrets.
---
dunno if its just me but guns are kinda useless to me sometimes they hit but most of the times they seem to not to . im still low level about level 6 but notice that most of the time it doesnt seem to work so well not sure if its a bug with this patch or not.  Melee seems to work much better lol (good thing i spent a few points on strenght!)
---
or just apply the same rules on adventure mode as NW.  Max duration of 20s and the effect ends once you attack.
---
Oh good, this throws me back to the days of CS servers. "HEY JHON PAY ME THE SERVER" XD
---
Theyre paying additional money to Bethesda. The company that hasnt done enough to warrant charging 12.99 a month. Theyre rewarding bethesda. We all bought TSEs and what happened? They nerfed the shit out of them.
---
From what I can see in the game data, the mind control effect is a constant passive "spell" that causes nearby NPCs to be become allies in battle. It can also use another ability to heal its allies, supposedly for 100HP/second in 10-second bursts.
---
Side note: here's a list of everything they can control: https://i.imgur.com/piPmtKh.png
---
Yeah, they're getting ideas for their next subscription based RPG that will still not turn out to be an RPG
---
I agree. Everyone has a right to their opinion. I hope you keep enjoying the game. The bugs have been super annoying at times and I’ve turned the game off after too many disconnects at times. However, the fun I’ve had meeting new friends around the world and playing with friends I already know far out weigh the frustrations I’ve had. That’s what keeps me playing and not the promises they made and have not kept.
---
Not everyone will be aware that these items are duped, everyone or at least some people knows fallout 1st is a scam. Some refuse to see it, but what I'm saying is you can't compare the two and call people a hypocrite because of it.
---
You must be new to the game. Because at the beginning of the year duped items flowed as freely as dirty water
---
Thank you very much. Flatwoods monster is cool dude!
---
Down with the bourgeoisie!
---
But if its adventure mode how can they actually harm you?
---
But outer worlds is fairly choose-your-own-adventure, so immediate replays sound likely
---
Bethesda is vault tec, and 76 is their twisted experiment to drive all us dwellers mad.. it makes perfect sense
---
You're forgetting that Nintendo games at that time were cartridge based, which is why they had such a high cost. They were more expensive to manufacture than CD based (computer) games.
---
/clap
---
/r/obviousplant
---
No, I've played since beta, had around 600+ hours under my belt. I'm well aware of all the duped items that flooded the market. What I'm saying is not everyone will always be aware items they buy from people are duped.
---
Further proof that Bethesda=Vault-tec
---
As well they should
---
Someone on twitter has the idea of finding a bug somewhere in game that is so bad it can break it to get them to respond. Attacking other players can result in a ban (which I’m suggesting not doing if your a extra high level because so much legendary items you can lose) plus those who bought it are probably trying it before continuing.
---
I'm not a social media person, but I've seen friends and wife lose their phone for a few days, they lose their mind rofl.
---
I did still get it though, less than 50 cents a day &amp; I just got my tax back. I also spend a lot of time playing, think I'm up to about 1400 hours
---
Sure is! I also posted a map of their spawn points a while back: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cweott/datamined_map_of_flatwoods_monster_and_mothman/
---
...dat 2.5% spawn chance tho
---
I’m willing to bet many of the people hating on subscribers were aware
---
Might as well, you lose all credit for a kill upon death.
---
You can trigger it once a day, but only if you don’t have any extras. Toss them on the ground. Go to Whitesprings and in the military wing command center search the desks. There’s multiples of them in those desks. You’ll trigger the quest of it’s available. If it doesn’t trigger you may as well drop it and go back later. Any of them that you pick up that DONT trigger the quest will both become useless and suppress the quest from triggering.
---
You actually believe they will let us do such thing?
---
What I hope is that they let us host P2P servers for free when official mod support drops.
---
Ha! I got mobbed by a group of teddies myself. Was so busy laughing I couldn't defend myself.
---
Nah because for my mules, they are constantly hungry or thirsty and losing heath. I need to self destruct so I can fast travel to places.
---
Except they run more servers, given that each subscriber can spawn a new instance.
---
AWS licensing does not cover 'infinite' servers for a set fee.  Zenimax/Bethesda will incur increased licensing fees to host additional servers.  That is likely covered by a small fraction of the subscription cost.
---
&gt; apart from steel and lead for making ammo
---
Nonononononono...
---
You should NEVER hold onto that much steel, that's a rookie mistake.  Even if you need to make a shit load of ammo a quick trip to West Tek to farm the super mutants for their guns and equipping Scrapper will net you 19+ steel for every assault rifle.  So much of the scrap in this game can be farmed up like nothing if you just know where to go and which enemies to kill.
---
So will I get the quest if I dump all 70 and pick up a new one?
---
We love the fallout universe so much, and desperately want to play in it. While we dont like the game itself or many of the choices, we love the world. And so we stick to it.
---
I dont think you were really looking for a serious response, but there it is anyways
---
Holy! I think I can spot a real alien before a Flatwoods monster appears😂
---
I think it got taken down, which I find surprising.
---
I wish I could play a lot but I have school so I’ve only got around 340 hours. I will look into getting it but I can’t rn and I don’t think I can every month either
---
I will keep playing for much the same reason. I can still have fun playing it. I just personally do not want to further reward this game for paying for things that shouldn’t (in my opinion) be behind a paywall and originally weren’t going to be behind a paywall. Uninstalling won’t really “show it” to Bethesda. They already got my money at preorder. So I may as well enjoy what I can from the game.
---
Yeah, but didn't Todd want me to play for 10 years? ;)
---
Best advice here. Try before you buy
---
No
---
Why do you think they got rid of survival servers? They got rid of them so they could literally start selling servers to us. I'm surprised people don't understand this is a scam..
---
Seriously? 
---
One is $5 to play 100+ games, including new releases and newer AAA games.
---
The other is $13 to get semi-private servers, "convenience" mechanics, and some pixels (armor and atoms). The only thing BGS genuinely had to work on for F1st is the private servers, which are reportedly broken and not really private. F1st also creates a pseudo-P2W dichotomy between players.
---
MSFT curates a large uncatalogued of games for you to play that you would otherwise have to spend A LOT more than $5 on.
---
Can you really not see which is the better value and fairer for everyone?
---
They’re waiting for most people to forget about this, so they can release their cookie cutter “apology”.
---
Yes that’s the point, all the shop prices have been inflated by a 1000 pts because of the ‘free’ atoms. That’s why every so expensive, Bethesda stupidly offered atoms for free when they shouldn’t have. 
---
Think about how amazing the game would be if you didn’t have free atoms, all that utility stuff on the atomic shop like this fridge would be unlock-able in the game rather behind a paywall which is a paywall.
---
Maybe he lives in California, they keep shutting our power off for days at a time lol
---
P2W is an expression for something the players buy that enhance their gameplay above that of others who don’t pay.
---
Cosmetic items do not affect substantive game play, all it does is make you look cool. Having unlimited stash means less time spent encumbered, more materials, which means more resources... the fast travel tent w/ stash is a big advantage as well.
---
This is unfair for players who don’t want to spend that money. Real world money should not affect this, for obvious reasons.
---
That should be the case. Do be sure you've completed the BoS questline first though.
---
Slowly
---
Is this some sort of joke?
---
If you only want it for the private world, I'm sure people will share  I'm the other side of Australia so I'm mot much help to you
---
I was pressing X to respawn but it wasnt doing anything. Ended up having to restart the game and lost out of the loot from the SBQ. Fucking pissed.
---
"game"?
---
Haha no it’s okay and I’ve actually got an Australian friend whose gonna let me borrow it when they get on!
---
Thanks for all the help though I appreciate it!!
---
I've seen about 4 of them in 992 hours, but if you ever need to hunt one for a challenge or whatever, you could easily find one in a few hours with this map.
---
Fallout 76
---
Why are you thinking of buying it in the first place? Fuck Bethesda.
---
Agreed. Power armor displays are also a big request that I would love to see.
---
For me it's the community (that actually plays the game).
---
I also enjoy Nuclear Winter from time to time.
---
YES
---
Imagine being the type of person who plays a highly-derided game and bullying people playing the same game on a subscription model, as if you're any better than them.
---
Thanks again. Really appreciate the time you putted into that.
---
The easiest solution would be to not give these subscribers an icon that would make them stand out.
---
Make a ticket! My friend had the same thing happen and they refunded way more than he lost.
---
Yes. I also made a post prior to answering this that explains how it works.
---
Yeah I checked before I started I had like 135gb free and it’s was a 65gb download
---
Oh frick my eta said 11hrs
---
Don’t hold your breath
---
My little girl grabbed my mobile, sorry!
---
No I’m not. I still own the same N64 I had then.
---
Its cool
---
I'm actually morbidly curious as to how you justify the Fridge being cosmetic only.
---
Dont shoot back and get off survival mode
---
tough day at the workshop?
---
It actually happened and now I have to get all the over 100 caps back!!!!
---
Thanks for helping me prove my point. No one is innocent here in life playing the game for personal gain. Get mad at Bethesda? Sure. Get mad at other players? That’s completely hypocritical especially with long time players
---
1. Its not broken to for people to only go into fights they know they can win.
---
2. PvP is optional and literally consensual. 
---
3. You can lose 50 caps which isnt much and not seek revenge or you can lose all your caps attacking someone you know you cant beat.
---
What they should done is:  
---
\- Fix the game  
---
\- Introduce (interesting) content  
---
\- Then \_maybe\_ ask for some kind of money
---
You want to see this game prosper... but you don't want anyone to spend any money on it?  Grow the fuck up, this isn't a fantasy world where Bethesda can pay for developing this game with nothing but the player bases love of the Fallout franchise.  
---
If you want the ranger armor that badly then just pay for a fucking month of the subscription, it's no different from buying one of those limited time atom bundles that gets you a free outfit.  But you won't because you're a cheap mother fucker and what you really want to do is use your free atoms in the shop so you never have to spend any money actually supporting the game.
---
Good, they deserve it.
---
Dumpster fire.
---
All bethe$da had to do was make the game F2P with First as an optional subscription, they may have even gotten positive feedback for that.
---
But hey, The Outer Worlds is great fun!
---
They literally said they cannot increase the capacity because it'll break the game.
---
I haven't noticed anyone griefing on PS4. BUT the worst part is all those griefers in game and all the astroturfers here aren't even effective in enacting change. The way to do it is uninstall the game, or at least fill out the feedback forms. I mean the people who don't even play the game don't care, they're just here to make the issue seem worse and pile on the shitshow lol
---
I'm not saying you've forgotten your Nintendo 64, I'm saying you're forgetting/missing/not taking into consideration that the reason *why* the games were more expensive was because they were cartridge based. Jeez...
---
Only thing I can think of is the bundles are a one time purchase...maybe they're doing it like this to encourage people to keep their subscriptions going?
---
50 caps was a lot to me
---
Earlier this year I was maybe around level 40 and a dude came up to me and dropped of a vampire weapon and some camaleon armor. I thought, “what a nice feller”, then I saw he also dropped 100 nuka cola quantums. 
---
Sometimes it’s just obvious there is some funny business going on.
---
So rare outfits such as asylum workers and stuff will be less rare as ppl would just be going in and out of their own pvt server where loot will be untouched? That's BS. And those who pays to damage the economy with the community should be ostracized. If you don't want to PvP stay in your 🌎 or the community will get you.
---
60 dollars. And tons of money they received while making the game, because of pre-buyers frenzy fever.
---
And I thank you for being mature enough to not be toxic or make it one side versus the other.
---
Just don't wear identifying clothing or icons when in public servers.
---
I don't like the addition of the scrapbox as a paid item, but that doesn't mean that I should mess with people that bought the subscription.
---
Are most of the teddy bears in E.A.T.T.?
---
What is of interest is come next month, it is stated on their site you will still have access to the scrap box even if you cancel. I am not sure if they just mean the juk you currently have inside or full use. This alone once found out could shut a lot of people up from their complaining.   
---
But yeah 1650 atoms for $13 plus the outfit alone is worth it. Haters are just hung up on the $99 package.
---
"Pay to win" usually implies some goal that you accomplish easier by paying money for it. What is "winning" in Fallout? Holding more scrap? Getting another random legendary weapon? If this shit affected Nuclear Winter or Survival, there'd be a point. But Adventure as it is doesn't really have anything to "win".
---
You mean like all the people who mod Bethesda games using this exact same engine and fix and improve the games better than Bethesda ever has? You mean those people? Lmao 🙄
---
&gt;They suck at the game but are "big" fallout fans
---
It's literally impossible to 'suck' at Fallout 76. so this is straight bullshit.
---
&gt;As fans they don't know or understand basic lore
---
Is that the lore that is presented in text form as something that already happened sometime in the past?
---
&gt;As "Content Creators" all they ever do is play on PC and therefore don't understand how consoles work and report activity on PCs as gospel.
---
Read: 'I only know of PC content creators so they must all use PC'. And why does console matter anyway? It is just a shitter version of the PC offering.
---
Something like that is panfully obvious, but when you go to a vendor and only see a single TSE handmade you can't just assume, "oh hey, this guy's a duper!" I understand that the game is in fact full of duped weapons and we all probably have some duped items but sometimes there's just no telling if some of them are duped or not.
---
Death to Hu_man76!!!
---
Jk man, glad to hear you're getting some enjoyment out of it! Any reason in particular? And did you just do a month or a full year?
---
No I’m not. You’re missing the entire point and arguing a different one.
---
I mean Liberty Prime is a satire of Americana, so you’ll kinda look like a dipshit wearing it.
---
They needed the servers for fallout1st would be my guess
---
I totally agree. I just wanted to chime in and say sometimes it is obvious.
---
Survival mode doesnt even exist anymore.
---
Its a slap in the face for people who bought this game for $60, and got an unfinished, buggy alpha, and still to this day we have more of a game but it might as well have an early access watermark because thats what it is. 
---
And no, you are actually wrong, I stopped playing forever ago because the gameplay cycle got boring very early on, with hopes that they would make this into more of a game that isnt just essentially a buggy Fallout 4 mod and I'd be able to come back and enjoy what should be a full priced title. This Fallout 1st crap basically just put the nail in a coffin, and right at the same time Outer Worlds came out, too. I've played one day of that game and have already had more enjoyment than my three months of Fallout 76, right after release day. In 76, I just was always feeling like soon, I would get to the good part, the meat of the experience, and be able to enjoy what I'm doing, but it was always just more and more of the same scrap collecting and dumping stuff at my base, and then finding out I dont have enough space for all the materials I have stored up for about a week of playtime and have to dump stuff that later, I end up needing. 
---
Admittedly, like I said, I haven't played in a long time. So yeah, I'm biased. But I'm not being an asshole about this. I was geniunely asking what keeps you all interested. I guess I forgot for a sec that you cant ask someone to explain their differing point of view without them thinking you're a bandwagon Nazi who just wants to shit on your side of the story.
---
Lmao probably. I am so sick of the stars and stripes shit in the atom shop
---
Having a multiplayer game with player combat and competition for resources implies there are individual situations in which someone is a winner and someone is a loser. Giving people and advantage and content that was
---
A) promised to free players
---
B) should have been free
---
Is a smack in the face to players who paid $60 and don’t have the financial retardation to drop $12.99 on such an inane purchase
---
&gt; in 76 ALL LIFE AS WE KNOW IT IS AT RISK
---
Except it isn't, because you know it all turns out ok in the end.
---
Yeah of course, super obvious and your story actually made me chuckle a little. I just don't see why OP is comparing the two because it kinda' doesn't make sense to me..
---
Are you saying theres no one outside of Bethesda who has experience with the game engine and knows how it works?
---
Right to the left of that big looking palace thing on the top part of the map. Its drawing looks like a cemetery
---
Jfc, I don't get how people stand you IRL.
---
&gt;Conspiracy reasoning: they just wanted to use the servers as the new private servers
---
Why do people keep repeating this nonsense? The game is hosted on cloud servers and they spin them up and down as needed. There are no "leftover survival servers" to recycle.
---
You can access what you put in it. You cant add to it if not paying.
---
You’re wrong for doing it
---
For me it doesn't freeze each 5 seconds but when we are talking about Charleston, that make my fps go from 30 to 10, but is enjoyable. I don't have immersion breaks.
---
Rads. I can drop a pumpkin grenade, or nuke mine on anyone, and kill them, regardless of pvp settings. It's something that has only recently come to public attention, and something I accidentally discovered with my cousin when I killed him with a pumpkin grenade, just trying to spook him.
---
It's not always terrible, just sometimes.
---
Philippi Battlefield Cemetery, top middle of the map
---
Nah, it exists - even during pre-war times. It's essentially just riot gear used by police riot squads at the time. The NCR repurposed it for their own Rangers, but it's *always* existed, and it's *always* looked like that; you can even find a set that belongs to The Survivalist in the Honest Hearts DLC, and he was around both before and after the bombs fell.
---
See, some other people who commented here just assumed I'm being an asshole, or jumping on the wagon with other people who don't like the Fallout 1st sub. You gave me a genuine answer to my question, and I applaud you for that.
---
They honestly deserve it
---
Yep, EA's continued existance is proof of that...
---
I cant believe they really made an article saying Capitalism and a free market is evil
---
Right, I was playing regularly and enjoying it until a month or so ago, so for almost a year of play, I'd say I got my money's worth out of the game.  
---
But being almost a year post-launch with no new content of worth that isn't behind ATOMs that enjoyment finally dwindled.  Pushing Wastelanders back to Q1 2020 gave me nothing to look forward to in the near-ish term, because even if that means it comes out not batshit crazy broken, it still means there's no content update in sight for months.  What pushed me over the edge was them pushing this bullshit about giving players what we've been asking for with this FO1st malarky.
---
Thanks!
---
The guys name was blegg90
---
ESO is a little different, being that it is actually an MMO, and they give you more, imo, than this Fallout 1st thing does. 
---
But I totally agree with what you're saying here.
---
I get that you are trying to raise the quality of the market and all but you should always know that triple aaa studios might make good games but no matter what they are in it for the money, whether Reddit says it’s one of the good ones or not.
---
A better argument? To — what? — pursuance you to not be sore over a game? Nah.
---
honestly most of us that paid for it have been around since beta... lol I DARE someone to try and mess with me... it'll just be free caps for me for the bounties. that's about it lol
---
Still good for crippling though.
---
Congrats, you’re the reason large companies and governments eternally get away with whatever they want.  If people that said “what I do won’t make a difference” did what they knew was right anyway, it would absolutely matter.  The “my vote doesn’t matter” argument is literally the only reason your vote doesn’t.
---
At this point, you have no real reason to complain about fallout 1st if you've been playing this heap. Besthesda knows you'll play anything and will like it so why would they not introduce something like this?
---
hey, my pleasure!
---
That’s why I swapped from Xbox to PC for the most part.
---
Most is deserved
---
Are you not trying to make the argument that video games have always cost this much? Because that just isn't true. PC games back then didn't cost this much, and you can't compare PC prices to Nintendo prices because Nintendo was *always* more expensive because their games came on cartridges.
---
Okay so you quit playing a long time ago but came on to the subreddit to complain about something that has no effect on you whatsoever.   I mean you are saying you quit 9-10 months ago yet here you are offering an opinion without any other new first hand knowledge of the game or dlc and events they have been done. What a sad tiny life you must live. Why be on here? Why even bother with your time? I mean you literally wasted it to be on a bandwagon that you are not even part of.   
---
You seem a troll an incel troll at that, that is what I was looking for...phew...
---
Just a picnic.
---
Better than naaaaaature!
---
Extra content that was promised to be free mind you
---
everytime it happens i get a little bit of cancer, but i still like the game
---
Get bothered that they are ruining the game by lying and putting P2W features into the game?
---
ya i been taking bubblegum, gumdrops, been making molotovs and some things to drop. I been grinding for atoms so I can get the Halloween bundle as well. I knew I should have saved my atoms, I spent some this summer on that nice bar and stool table bundle and the mothman bundle.
---
If you’re playing Fallout Economic Simulator, then that’s your business, I guess? Personally, that seems to be an exercise in boredom.
---
... except for the friends I bring along.
---
&gt;Having a multiplayer game with player combat and competition for resources implies there are individual situations in which someone is a winner and someone is a loser. That does not imply there is an end to the game or an overall winner. 
---
Again, how do you "win" in Fallout? There literally is no "winning". 
---
&gt;There is however competition that certain players have an advantage over so long as they hand Bethesda money. 
---
You really think that someone with Fallout 1st automatically gets the resources first just because they paid extra? 
---
&gt;Giving people and advantage and content that was
---
&gt;A) promised to free players
---
&gt;B) should have been free
---
&gt;Is a smack in the face to players who paid $60 
---
And the WoW subscription is a slap in the face to players who paid full price for the game when it launched. Or ESO. Seriously, it's not as personal as you're trying to make it. 
---
&gt;and don’t have the financial retardation to drop $12.99 on such an inane purchase
---
Yikes. Imagine calling people slurs because you don't like how they spend their money.
---
Good to know, it was a little loose worded it seemed that way but was vague enough that it may still work without the sub.
---
You scum.
---
Except that tachyons screwed things up.  Its explicitly explained in the comic and the movie.
---
Well this is obvious the first step into the realm for BGS &amp; Fallout. I’m sure over the next few months they’ll spruce up 1st &amp; the game in general in preparation for Wastelanders which at this point is looking like their major make or break moment. Most of the fan base is in fury over F1st &amp; the rest of us are just here in empty servers &amp; chilling lol. I’m sure they’ll add more you’ll get with 1st like ESO but then people will freak out the games pay-to-win. I’d truly hate to be a developer even though I’ve always kinda thought about it
---
It doesnt take it, it says a 50 caps reward for killing them, but they get the same thing, its taken from the other player when they die
---
use missile turrets, you wont have no issue with distance then
---
A sniper turret would be lovely.
---
You can make 1400 caps a day selling random stuff to robot vendors at low levels 100 caps isn’t anything. Nothing happens if someone attacks you. You attacked them back and sought revenge. Turn on your pacifist mode, and this won’t be an issue.
---
Wont be home till Monday, but do let me know if you'd still like to then. And try and pay attention to when you're doing it. Looks for lots of active high level players. If theres a lot on, most will show up to help I've noticed
---
I don't think Todd even worked on 76. Remember when he said people from other devs like id also worked on the game? I don't think it was because the game was big. I think it was because they were severely understaffed. Also the only reason they got Todd to announce was just too sell the game. And now we have all these rumours that this is all done for some investor or such thing.
---
Best thing you can do is report them for toxicity.
---
See me not giving 2 shits what you think? Cause I don’t my money and I’ll keep spending it on this game. So many pros to having the private server and very very few cons.
---
Nuke mines still kill you, I've thoroughly tested this, as well as pumpkin grenades.
---
LOL your comprehension skills are low but it was a good try. *pats head*
---
Lol. I'm sorry for having disposable income and supporting a game I love.
---
Was this a good move from Bethesda? No, especially not after delaying Wastelanders. Do I hope they compensate all F76 players with something for this fuck up? You bet!
---
Still, I found value in this bundle and I bought it.
---
Don't harass me just because our opinions differ. You probably don't even play anyway.
---
Man give it a rest. Its been 48 hours.
---
Go back to playing the game and having fun.
---
Quit bumming people out for wanting to get more stuff for their favourite game.
---
Those people are probably upset at the other players for supporting this kind of practise, even if it's only for one month they acted how Bethesda predicted it and paid.
---
1) you win in fallout by killing someone else, killing enemies before someone else, getting resources before someone else, destroying someone’s camp, completing a quest before someone else. Do you not know what “competitive” means?
---
2) yes, someone with fallout 1st has an advantage over someone who doesn’t have fallout 1st. They can repair their weapons better and easier, less encumbered, their food spoils less, they can fast travel much easier, etc etc etc. that’s having an advantage.
---
3) are you comparing WOW and ESO to this lol? First off, WOW is like $20 initially. The monthly subscription is to run a far more complicated game than Fo76, the people actually get their money’s worth. ESO actually includes a far greater amount of content for the cost. While both are pretty similar to P2W they didn’t promise the opposite, AND the monthly subscription actually gets you your money’s worth. Bethesda blatantly LIED to people, saying all future updates would be free spare cosmetics. Then they said and admitted they lied...
---
Specially with speed demon, uhhhhg
---
Don't you think it has more to do with people being bored with the game, so they're griefing players because there's not much else to do for "fun" in the game?
---
Not going to happen. This was a major screw up on their part, especially after delaying Wastelanders.
---
The game is already so lonely. I can’t imagine paying to make it more so. I play ESO daily and it’s always hopping, new updates, new areas, tons of quests and npcs. Really wish they would add new areas and updates half as often.
---
You son of a bitch
---
Dude I've never posted here until today but the only person I see being a toxic used adult diaper is you 😂😂.  You sound exactly like the kind of person who takes video games so seriously because it's all you have in your life and it's the only way you get social interaction because no one IRL will ever choose to hang with you.
---
Take your own advice with the facts are facts tidbit.  Fact is you're a pathetic dweeb.
---
Correct I believe it was the Desert Rangers that joined the ncr
---
Why did blegg do that?!
---
Either that or earned it doing challenges, i have most emotes unlocked as well as a few skins and paints. Never spent more than the 30 to buy the game
---
I have a feeling it will. They have turned the game around A LOT since launch. I quit shortly after shelling out $$ for the tricentennial edition at launch, only to come back 5 months after because I heard good things. 
---
Other than this subscription, they did a lot of good things. And realistically, if you treat the sub as a one time bundle - it's not a bad deal.
---
This is sarcasm right? Or not I don't care. Is your opinion mine is not the same if you're serious about your statement.
---
And...doing what, exactly? You can't hurt them with tickle damage anymore, you can't destroy their camps anymore, you can't rob them or anything. Absolute worst they can do is spam shit over voice/messaging, annoy you with explosives, or follow you around trying to kill enemies before you can tag them. All three can be easily avoided with a mute and a block, worst comes to worst maybe a server hop.
---
Thats hilarious and totally fits the wasteland.
---
Sorry I can't hear you over this insane robot emote I'm doing
---
I could just unload my .50 and my Gat, but it's not worth it when they're in air. If the fuckers land, that's a different story, they're dead, lol. If not for me, my Bloodied buddy will take care of bidness. :P
---
You can't get griefed in this game unless you actively allow it.
---
And with all of the free atoms out there this would make them money... how?
---
I haven't even been trying that hard and I have well over 15000 atoms saved up... if Bethesda doesn't occasionally release shit like this they'd never see a single penny from me ever again.
---
And who that don’t love it is stupid
---
I got the Xbox game pass for a month and was only a buck and playing it that way on PC
---
Society
---
You disproved your own point lol
---
I agree. I’m playing it now and it’s so amazing.
---
Maybe
---
You are the one that is the problem.
---
Oh that is what they should do. Give an outfit with it every month.
---
runs great on base ps4 weirdly
---
Well, in that case you could have helped me understand by answering my question. I guess my comprehension skills are on the same level as your debating skills.
---
And in between when the game is fixed to the point everyone is happy and they can start asking for money again they're supposed to pay their game developers in... the well wishes of a thankful playerbase?  Video games cost money to make.
---
I mean on my understanding fallout itself is satire xD
---
Agreed. I really wonder why they didn't include this option.
---
Well.... $$, but still. Should have been included.
---
&gt; There are a lot of fucking morons in this community
---
Are there really that many players left?
---
Who knew the majority of people in this sub were such plump woolly sheep. Talking about OP here. Yes by all means keep throwing your hard earned money (or more likely the money off your parents credit card)  at a company who has no problem looking you in the eye while flat out lying to enable a money making scheme on a community of dedicated fans (the likes of which I haven’t seen before). When you hype up your game to the max prior to launch and then upon launch your game proves to be a broken mess which then takes you over a year to “fix” while simultaneously taking the good feedback from your community and selling it back to them at an unfriendly price. Focusing the majority of your efforts, not on the bugs in adventure mode that have been around since day 1, but on the overpriced, unappealing atomic shop items. Since launch I’ve seen maybe 3-4 power armour skins that looked cool. Everything else just looks like garbage. Cheap garbage that cost a pretty penny. 
---
I totally get everyone has their own opinions and can waste their money however they like but it just sucks to see part of your excellent community fall prey to a corporations money making schemes and bullshit lies when it’s painfully obvious this was a very bad move on their part.
---
This is a game based on raiding and looting corpses, kindly shut up
---
LOL someone thumbs down’d me while doing it so I considered denying them tags on the legendary enemies at Uranium Fever. I took the high road and didn’t do that though.
---
So all the firsters just told Bethesda, make exclusive outfits that cost 12.99 and dont make them available to everyone. So theyll pump out new items exclusive only to firsters and neglect all us lasters til we all leave because we arent wanted or valued. So we are the ones getting griefed. If you dont think better items meant for the atom shop will now be withheld to keep people subscribed you are dreaming.
---
7 hours in, I'm enjoying it a very good bit
---
Been saying this elsewhere, for the people who already buy all the bundles and atom packs anyway ("whales") this is a good deal. If only they separated all the gameplay-affecting things from fallout 1st, the outraged would have been minimal compared to what we have now
---
that actually isnt true. if for example you have one of the mutations that causes damage to you when you are struck you can be damaged. people can actively block you from progressing on things and can sit there and follow you around throwing things like nuke mines which can cause rads even if on pacifist or using explosive weapons to cause you to not be able to hear/see very well. hopping servers and blocking them really doesnt help either
---
Turret range is a server limitation.
---
But for $15 a month we'll sell you a Turret Range Extender with 500 free atoms!
---
I noticed that also, Bethesda doesn't play when it comes to micro transactions... Copies do exist though
---
The same can be said about the other games too
---
Cone find me...
---
I'll be hanging at my CAMP outside Whitesprings dancing the robot in my NCR ranger outfit.
---
Ok
---
If you're lvl 41 then you lost 41 caps and that's objectively not alot. That's only enough to buy 1 bulk steel
---
Is this satire? ^plz be satire
---
Fuckers that give them anymore money deserve whatever they get in game.
---
&gt;have ruined any hope for having an economy in game.
---
No one's forcing you to purchase things from their vendors. I know I won't be.
---
Apparently not. No one is playing it, they are all here saying stupid shit.
---
Upvoted simply for the on/on of Todd’s meaty man meat in your mouth.  Well done.
---
A few Facebook fallout groups... all good comments!
---
No, no, no- that’s for Skyrim. And it’s not all on one device- you’re supposed to play it for a year, then re-buy it for your smart fridge, then the next year for your graphing calculator, etc. ;)
---
It is bad because they will now keep things out of the atom shop and only allow firsters to have them.
---
I still love the game, but i hate Fallout 1st, and i hate bethesda's bad decisions about it. i don't hate the players who bought it, but i'm still disappointed in them funding it.
---
I don't think anyone deserves griefing, and as long as i don't need to ever even think about giving them anymore money for that trainwreck of a subscription, i'll just keep enjoying the main game, the game that i paid for thanks...
---
Hol up..how do you keep the buff?
---
That might be their plan,  there's apparently multiple reskins of the ranger armor in the files.  They'd be shooting themselves in the foot otherwise to release any of them in the atom shop and remove an incentive to buy a month of 1st.
---
You can easily mod yourself any outfit by replacing cosmetic models with the ones from the atomic shop.
---
You tried with audio settings? If not well, what a shame and loud music isn't it?
---
Spoiler: your teammate is dancing too.
---
Ding ding
---
Yeah
---
Hey it's my Fallout 1% subscriber friend, Capitalism is great here in California where PG&amp;E is shutting off our power to avoid the chance of wildfire in the area. Monopolies are great, where else would I get my gas, water and electricity to my overpriced home?
---
Oh no ill try that
---
Well, we are like that. In this dark times we need more players. When wastelanders hits we want to be sure to have an stable community.
---
That's especially odd, since I've heard things about it frying some people's Xbox One Xs
---
no you actually are not the ones getting griefed. like how would you like it if you were constantly harrassed and forced to have to switch servers which doesnt even usually help or go to your private server when you actually wanted to spend time with other people in the game. I personally bought it for a few reasons and one of those is so that i have the private world to go to when im being griefed. supporting griefing in any fashion is supporting griefing in all fashions.
---
they have been giving us plenty of great stuff in the atom shop that wasnt for first subscribers. I do not see that changing any time soon. just because the first subscribers can get extra things (which btw if you buy atoms at all for stuff then its actually a great deal due to the price being less than the equivalent atom price plus is comes with other perks) doesnt mean its going to be anything super great. I'll know each patch what will be coming to first subs and what wont and if that changes ill definately change my stance but as of now we literally only get a very few things.
---
Bethesda’s doing it through shitty business decisions and Blizzard’s doing it through shitty political decisions.
---
I wanted the ranger armor since launch. I will not be renewing. How is me buying a set I wanted + $15 worth of Atoms for $13 shady?
---
We had bundles that are much worse than this sold in the store and no one complained.
---
They’re the top posts for a reason, trolls don’t usually stick around 3-4 days. People are genuinely upset.
---
You know there is an option that keep you from accidentally starting a PvP fight, right?
---
People find ways around that and so I need to remove basically all my mutations just to be able to remove something that isn't even the only thing that they can do? Enough server hopping will put them on the same server as you. and again there are other things that they can do
---
$8.33 is a cheap price for private servers that let me avoid the jerks. The other benefits are just a nice bonus.
---
subreddits are tapeworms, and games are their hosts. mods wring their hands and start panicking when devs destroy the game their subreddit is based on. tow is, as you've said, unrelated to fo76, except that it is being mentioned by players of fo76. the fact that tow is even being mentioned on this board at all, let alone the lionization of obsidian, should be a massive red flag to this community in general, and very clearly **makes the mods of r/fo76 extremely nervous and insecure**
---
not a good look, you massive dweebs
---
Wasn’t for tax evasion, an Aussie site had FO76 on sale for 13$USD while it was still like 35$USD here.
---
BRB, buying Fallout 1st. Please bring me salty tears, I will put them in my scrapbox.
---
Got that icon, that armor, that scrapbox and that tent. Don't hate the player, hate the game.
---
There  are people who defiantly care at Bethesda even if people want to think otherwise.
---
Todd Howard said it best at e3 2019 when he said he looks at even the criticism because he knows most of it is from people who genuinely care about the game and want it to be like what they have come to enjoy in the past. 
---
There going to have to dig deep and make Wastelanders a dlc that can bring back at least some of there former fans because these seasonal events are horrible at the moment.
---
The only point I proved is feeding a troll.
---
Idk man, haven't played the game in weeks but looking at the outrage on this subreddit alone, the publicity and the general stupidity on Bethesda's part that's the reasoning behind it that I came up with
---
&gt;Tax evasion is one thing most governments are good at sorting out.
---
No, they really aren't.
---
Most of the Triple Ahhhs have been double dipping. Rockstar was getting grants from the UK goverment for example, while paying 0 tax. Activision hasn't paid taxes but has recieved tax rebates.
---

---
I really did that a month ago but it was 'cause I buyed a dlc. HOW IS POSSIBLE THAT A RAIDER LVL 35 DEALS THAT DAMAGE? That's my only question.
---
I just want a better map, not a more difficult game. NV's map is easily its weakest quality.
---
The difference is I don’t care if you like my opinion or not. Every single person on planet earth has an opinion on everything. I’m not going to go around crying like a little bitch and griefing people because someone doesn’t agree with me. Don’t like my opinion? Cry about it. Feel free to be triggered all you’d like, I said what I came to say and I’m not really interested in anything you’ve got to say. Adults crying about a video game is stupid. Grow up.
---
Oh man, its even the high score code from Maniac Mansion!!
---
Pre orderer and beta player here and this is exactly how I feel. Huge dick punch. If it was like 5 bucks a month purely for the private server without the scrap box and sex tent I wouldn’t feel so strongly about this.
---
No harm done in waiting, if the first membership makes it a year I guarantee that they’ll put some new BS up that everyone will want for people to renew their 1yr subscription.  Good marketing.
---
It goes against the themes of Fallout at this point haha
---
And you can do your part too! I didnt think i wanted to be a mean old raider, but these guys make it seem like the right call.
---
I submitted a ticket about this. I've lost so many queen fights because I died at the very end of the event
---
I just had the same experience. There are things 76 does do better, but NPC combat AI isn’t one of them. I really hope the human NPC’s inherit Fallout 4’s AI. It was so much more fun in that regard.
---
Everyone doesn’t do it because it’s easier to get on Reeeee-ddit and seek confirmation bias... Why make friends and work together with them when you can just complain and suck at the game?
---
Congrats on getting the dunce mtx.
---
Again, you're supporting lies, for a 2$ difference.
---
Don't act surprised when Starfield or ES6 features the same kind of bullshit.
---
Really, you had bundles locked behind a paywall for p2w?
---
&gt;no brainier.
---
No shit.
---
People who buy this are only hurting the rest of us in the long run and make the game die sooner rather than later.
---
I suggest submitting a ticket: https://help.bethesda.net/
---
Most of it is from people who never played though. They'll openly admit it. Piling on to make the issue seem worse makes the whole thing look disingenuous
---
The monthly sub gives you more Atoms than the entire sub costs. Honestly, if you're buying cosmetics enough, just pay for the monthly sub, and cancel when you don't play as much. If you don't, don't pay for it. 
---
Wow. So difficult.
---
*laughs in pacifist mode and hides in his private server safe from all griefers* targeting players eh? Lets see them target me pfft.
---
Eat the rich, man. Eat the rich.
---
I see now that you went back and edited your one liner responses AFTER I had already replied to them. How on earth am I supposed to be able to debate this with you when you do this kind of dishonest editing?
---
Yes. But it doesn't stop the jerks from bringing super mutants to your camp. The private server option does. Worth the money to avoid those griefers. I came back because of the availability of private servers. I am happy with the option to avoid them.
---
Couldn’t make it through Far Harbor because of frame drops and motion sickness. Not even kidding.
---
This is actually pretty funny to me.  The biggest value of the subscription IMO is that you can pay your way out of inventory management.  So for $13 you could go to your private server, take every workshop, and farm mats like a mad man for a month.  Then cancel and live off the scrap for who knows how long.
---
My money says Bethesda starts repossessing non-member scrap boxes before the end of the year.
---
No. Not spending money and using their servers is fine. We arent contributing to them so nothing hypocritical. I am pissed about 1st but i will play the holidays and then wastelanders. I will 100% never spend another dime now though, where as before i was tempted.
---
You scrubs can pay for my new content
---
Not so much. I just think it wasn't worth it. And waiting for sales is always a good idea
---
Yea i can understand not liking it but to constantly shit on it and the people who play it is stupid especially youtube gaming channels  if you don't like it put out a review and then you never have to talk about it again but it's easy to get clicks by hating on it
---
I gladly would shell out some cash if they had actually made some decent content, I have no reason to because they previously spent money has had little to no effect.  Two month old bugs that still can’t be fixed.
---
Oh... well... hopefully that isn't just for the first month 1st is live then. I'm not sure yet if I want to jump in, but that Ranger Armor is real tempting.
---
Why does this have upvotes?  
---
**Everyone playing already paid for the full-price, buggy, broken, half-finished game**.  
---
Other companies deliver a finished product that's actually worth playing for that price.
---
Yeah, the drug dealing rapist who is contradicted by Mrs. Bishop in the same game couldn't *possibly* be lying. 
---
Or they made one mistake in one line of text in a game with literally tens of thousands of lines of text. God forbid humans make an error.
---
I think that the majority of the latter being “bad” is Bethesda is monetising a feature through amazon servers instead of allowing us to host locally like Minecraft does, at this point I’m over it.. I’m just going to suck up my pride and get the last couple trophies I need and the Ranger outfit and that’s it, Wastelanders can drop in mid January presumably and then we’ll start getting excited for E3 like Demons Souls remaster maybe (I’m irreparably horrible at souls style games btw)
---
Thats just not true. Its like saying, you grow your own tobacco so you support big tobacco.  If you arent giving them money or posting positive things you are "using them" like they are "using us"
---
There’s those moving goalposts again. Now I’m dishonestly editing my posts 😂
---
Yea the community is really great which is rare with online shared world games
---
most probably that yeah,
---
I mean even I am upset about their decision even though I usually defended the game for the most part until now though I'm going to play for the event ,then uninstall and forget about it's existence until I see reviews that Wastelanders was a success
---
Yeah, the CTD when your graphics settings are too high and under the Charm attribute description they misspelled "affects", game breaking shit imo
---
But you're not gonna fill out a feedback report that they'll read?
---
I have the Bill Gates problem in Fallout where it wouldn’t be worth my time in caps to try and scrape them back after I drop them......
---
....But I fucking love PvP so I do it anyway. Nothing like a 1v3 and leaving with over 2k caps.
---
I will say for the 3rd time, you are missing ZERO content. 
---
I'm not responding after this, you are beyond dense and may need psychological help.
---
I am practically invincible to some enemies in Fallout 76. Boy oh boy, Fallout 4 reaaaaally showed me who the boss is. Those turrets. Sheeeeeeeet...
---
Maybe they just like the skin? It’s like pretty much every other game with exclusive bundles, players paying large sums of money for cool cosmetics. I don’t support the subscription thing,  but even if I did, paying $20 for one month, just for a skin, is the same as someone spending $20 on an Atom Shop skin. No matter what you spend it on, you still say “ I support Bethesda’s bad decisions and pay them to abuse me”. All the money still goes to Bethesda.
---
So I should buy a sub using atoms, then when the sun gives me 1650 atoms i use that for a sub? Doesn't sound like they make the moola to me and that does not fit in to there bottom line.
---
Crap, I've been robbed
---
Right. I'm a troll for thinking $8.33 is a reasonable price to avoid low life griefers. Cool. I am happy with the game now.
---
It's people's choice how to spend their money, sure, but paying greedy devs for their blatant low-effort cash-grabs is also what enables and reinforces their greedy behaviour. They won't start giving a crap about their playerbase until they get punished in the wallet for their greed.
---
A lot of people used to genuinely love Bethesda which why emotions are high right now.
---
Yep, that's what we are doing right now. 
---
Private server workshop farming.
---
Pure pay to win. It's not simply convince, you are buying power. 
---
Am I sad this happened? You bet. Am I taking advantage of it? Lol, you bet.
---
Interesting, are there any other outfits that have the paint option? I know for example marine armor has unreleased paint options but it's the first time I hear about an outfit having them.
---
Fuck yeah, more PvP! Definitely signing up for FO1st now.
---
That’s why I spent my fallout 1 money on cod mw
---
I don’t even see the event as worth it, I’ve been a die hard defender of 76 since the start.  This new stuff is just so stupid.
---
Yeah same here. It's all so shameless.
---
(Bethesda to the community).
---
The middle class is finally rising up against the elites.
---
You know, for a guy ranting about the lore you seem to know jack shit about it.
---
frauds benefit from the assumption of ignorance, a lot of these companies get away with open face scams because their victims think "what idiots"
---
When u have a lot of friends it goes to bad just delete more than 150 friends and going isn’t lag
---
I'm not sure either what to expect but I paid for a product before release and atleast want to see what they came up with for this 'new' event because atleast Fastnacht and MeatWeek were somewhat on the better part of content of the game
---
We don't.
---
Oh really? Let's take some real like examples and put things into perspective.
---
Example 1.
---
You want to go to the game (football, baseball, basketball, whatever). You PAID for the ticket that's in your hand and that entitles you to see the game. You roll up to the stadium only to find out that--get this--you've got to PAY to park! WTF? This should be free since I bought your ticket! This game is behind a paywall!
---
Example 2.
---
You just moved into your first place (house, apt, etc). You need some entertainment to watch with your significant other. You see a flyer stating "Deluxe cable package $50/mo no contract, no gimmicks!" Sounds great. Until you get the bill. $10/mo for HD access and a multitude of fees that pushes your bill over $70/mo. WTF? There were no gimmicks because everything was ok'd by you in the subscriber agreement (fine print). But 'they' said '$50mo!' That company was your only choice of providers. What do you do?
---
Example 3.
---
Your kitchen sink gets backed up and you can't seem to unclog it. You call the plumber. The advertisement said low rates so you ask what the rates are. "$30/hr they say." Only $30? DEAL! All is well when those guys get your sink unclogged. Until you get the $60 bill. WTF? It took an hour but they charged you $60? Well, 2 guys @ $30 an hour = $60.
---
The bottom line is shit like this happens all day, every day to a huge majority of people, if not everyone. The kicker is there's not a damn thing you can do about it. You can boycott all you want, but "borderline criminal" is the status quo. While it may force you to walk to the stadium, it won't get you cable or your sink unclogged. It won't change. It won't stop. Money is king and this is the price we pay for convenience, like it or not.
---
I considered this and i hate fo1st. It goes against my morals supporting a shady bait and switch of a game. Do we know how long the ranger outfit will be available. Like is it just this month or at any point
---
Took one I didn't even have too. 😂
---
Lots of people on this sub seem totally fine with lying
---
&gt;It’s boring, they delayed the content update so they could make a shitty subscription service
---
Or they delayed it to iron our major issues since every other release has been bug ridden
---
I don't buy atoms. I paid for the game already.
---
I reinstalled Fallout again last week and it has been great. I'm playing on Very Hard and I'm running around with a Wounding Auto Combat Rifle in my BOS Power Armor with Danse by my side and we're tearing shit up.
---
I'm having fun with it too. The part where the woman (a raider) is asking for help outside the hardware store (where you collect the paint for the Wall). Yeah, no, I just killed her with one headshot before she even started moving.
---
I already have
---
They think that if we all stand together and boycott the service, it will somehow magically become free.
---
One in a million then, good on ya
---
Lol. The only thing workshops are useful for are fusion votes.
---
You can get any type of resource amount in 10 minutes thatll take workshops an hou to produce.
---
I guess Beta hasn't ended yet...
---
are they happy idiots, or is it just another game economy in a perpetual state of crash where its commodities have no extrinsic value
---
*guess we'll never know why the community is so nice*
---
I sell weapons cheap and don't know shit about dupping. You are confused and confusing.
---
Shame we’re not getting paid for testing it for then.
---
And they said 76 wasn’t an experimental vault...
---
idk. but it's a dying game. player numbers haven't broke 40k since the subscription announcement. the business model at this point is to fleece the ride-or-die fans as they watch the ship sink.
---
My comment has nothing to do with the weapons you sell
---
Dang. Sadly on Xbox. But thank you for confirming that they do!
---
In Fallout 1 it’s about stopping the master from turning everyone into super mutants or killing them
---
In 2 and 3 it’s about stopping the enclave from rising to power once again and subjugating or killing everyone they come across
---
In New Vegas it’s a turning point for the wasteland power struggle. Do the NCR win and begin to rebuild like the old world, or does the legion and we live in a brutal, tribal nature
---
Every other game has a larger threat, however the scorched is the first one to transcend all biological barriers and threaten all life, not just the lives of humans 
---
Downplaying the importance of the others to prove a false point isn’t a good idea. Your point absolutely does apply to every other form of media
---
Why watch a horror movie? You know the last survivor will kill the killer 
---
Why read/watch some war media? You know the people you’re following are gonna live
---
Why play an RPG? You know you’ll kill the villain in the end
---
Lol at blaming capitalism for PG&amp;E when corrupt politics fucked it to hell and back... and you still have a huge wildfire burning.
---
Got it back in March and looks like I completed about six achievements. Picked up the game earlier this month and haven't put it down since. Fallout 76 has its flaws, but its really is fun. If only it was an offline, single player game.
---
Not to be a bummer but there’s only 4 new cosmetics and a few pumpkins.  I’ll try it out at least.
---
so unlike every other time, maybe we should keep the storm going instead allowing it to wither away?
---
All of us already got recipes we didn't have before, and all of us played since launch. So workshops aren't entirely useless.
---
Gamers™ complain about video games more than they play them lol
---
I wasn't ranting, but I can appreciate the attempt so disassociate my argument with the use of dogshit rhetoric.
---
Actually every gun in the game does have a prime reciever but obviously the unique or super heavy guns like harpoon thrower, fatman, etc...
---
If you're supporting Bethesda in their unethical practices you're a moron and deserve to be griefed.
---
Ah, makes sense. All the power to you.
---
The people at IGN and Polygon are all scrubs at pretty much every game play. That’s why they are career clickbaiters. They’re TMZ for video games.
---
At least TMZ breaks a real story every so often.
---
ohh okay! good to know, thank you!
---
Go play FFXIV, the community is well known for being one of the nicest for MMOs.
---
I made this exact joke during the game release week and got downvoted to death.
---
How times change :)
---
People actually bought Fallout 1st subs? I hope it's just to test it out, but even then.
---
Well friend, not anymore! For a minimal monthly fee you can avoid the hassle of stash and scrap weight, leave inventory management to the peons!
---
Don't feed the monster. It Is unfair that they have Time to work on private servers, they charge you extra for it but still don't fix things like sentrybot noise or shotguns which dont kill or the 250 dr bug that ruins legendary weapons.
---
We do not, that's why I bought it now.
---
Hell, with the feedback and hate they are getting, they may remove it outright.
---
Todd please, make it more believable
---
So I don't play Fallout at all, but that's hilarious. It's like Kill the Rich, only in Fallout
---
Fallout 4 is a good game
---
Hahaha. Thats hell of a fix!
---
&lt;speaks Chinese&gt;
---
The other day I got three in a row!
---
Yes cause a lot of morons play this game. The more that leave the better. Leaves us decent people to play the game how we like it, without griefing or being dicks.
---
Sell for caps. Period. :)
---
It is rather hilarious, Capitalism has shaped our politics though and the governor here can't even do shit about it so your argument makes little sense.
---
Yeah and harassing other people definitely helps that. Jesus Christ.
---
it deleted on me during the beta :-(
---
i mean. active player numbers are below 40k. you're not going to see any big investment in fixing anything in this game. it just wouldn't make sense money wise. they made a good return off mostly reused/scrapped together stuff. they've turned a profit. at this point it's just about getting the last few bucks outta it before it just sinks completely. my guess is wastelanders was delayed because it's not really as they originally advertised and expect it to be a dissapointment, best to get subscriptions in before that.
---
The only drawback to that rifle being level 5 is the small condition bar.
---
That’s awesome
---
It has nothing to do with Bethesda and everything to do with the international monetary exchange fees for converting currency. So yeah, this time it actually makes sense to blame the banks!
---
Unfortunately a lot of people get sucked into it along the way
---
This community has always been fickle as shit. Fix one bug that's affecting like 15% of the community? Bethesda are gods this is why I keep buying atoms! Do one thing bad or wrong? Bethesda is shit and everyone needs to be fired and the whole studio rebuilt from the ground up.
---
Can confirm. 
---
Source: stock crashing to 50 percent of value over the last year.
---
Forget about the outfit and the tent. The game works better on private servers. That Is borderline illegal. It Is like saying: buy premium to play well.
---
If it keeps me and my best friend connected, despite years, and miles between us. I don’t care. This is our bond. I’t’s the glue that keeps us able to bond despite year, times, and marriage being something between us
---
&gt;a company I once loved, that I have given thousands of dollars
---
LMAO holy shit dude. I own every BGS game and it cost me 500 bucks tops. Sounds like you lack impulse control and buy microtransactions constantly, and now you're feeling buyer's remorse.
---
Don't forget the Atom Store where you can buy 1,000-1,500 Atoms for $10. This is keeping in mind that Atoms have basically 0 real world value.
---
That'd still be supporting the use of tobacco just like supporting the use of 76. You're keeping the game thriving by being a apart of its community. You bought 76 so they can subject you to advertisements. You're a number to show how many people are still playing the game after making their decisions. If you really want to make any impact at all, don't use their products, don't wear their products, don't buy their products. Same goes for boycotting any corporation from food to clothing, music, and video games.
---
"why do you care about things you like"
---
wtf is wrong with you. everyone wants this game to succeed. it was sold as a forever game, and that's what people want. you ever hear that cynics are disillusioned romantics? maybe not, but it's important to recognize that the *struggle* is getting people like you past the honeymoon phase so you stop rewarding fraud
---
What about all the people who don't actually play the game?
---
That’s not the problem, and you should know that.
---
Man I just wish they would add a mechanic that would play the game for me, it’s such a hassle at times.  Then I’d be set!
---
I like all these comments like suddenly this is what makes people realize class consciousness. Full year of Fallout 1st sub says maybe like three of these Gamers™ actually take it any further beyond "Bethesda and their supporters bad!"
---
Ok. Next time you wanna complain about lore though, maybe do some research so you're not making an idiot of yourself like you just did by complaining that a thing that existed before the war was a post war invention.
---
The subscribers are the ones paying for new content that everyone can then play.  There should be hate towards those paying $13/month, they should be thanked.  I’m pretty sure we wouldn’t have ever seen Wastelanders if people weren’t subscribing to Fallout 1st. 
---
I think there’s no question that the game is struggling financially, so they tried this to get to Wastelanders where they can hopefully turn the game around.  Would the people who are angry about 1st be happier if they instead said all severs would close down for good on January 1st?
---
This. Survival out, private servers in. Pay me extra.
---
Did you thank it?
---
If you have the right kind, they are great for crowd control during events, such as One Violent Night.
---
Agree. I played for a day and had people help me out. Helped build my base. I try and pass it on when I go see new people's bases too. Awesome community
---
yeah I know but who knows maybe the event activities are something interesting though otherwise there's not much left to do
---
It's BGS because they did what upper management told them to? How is that on them? What should they have done? Just quit?
---
Yes if you wait until I've responded before you edit your posts adding in actual explanations to your posts then yeah I would call that pretty dishonest. It was only because I clicked the thread again that I discovered that you have made edits, otherwise I would never had seen them.
---
Nevermind. I was trying to point out the problem with you comparing today's PC game prices to console game prices 20 years ago. You should have compared prices on the same platform. PC games didn't cost $60 back in the 90s. More like $30-40. Which I guess would be around $70 today, but you also have to take into consideration that people make more money today, and various other things related to inflation. $60 back then would be over $100 today which is an insane price for a game that is digitally distributed. Like I said, the only reason why Nintendo games were so expensive was because of the manufacturing cost.
---
LMAO ok sure bud
---
I admit I've been doing this since I saw the announcement, gotta keep those 1%ers in their place
---
LOL
---
Miles away...? Do neither of you have cars?
---
&gt;No such thing as a good community when the devs activly ruin the game and lie to the community. 
---
Wow, I didn't know Pete Hines had any direct involvement in the development of the game. Can you show me where that info comes from?
---
&gt;People will be angry, their anger will be misdirected at other players. And the circle goes on.
---
Yes, that makes harassment okay! Let's excuse harassment because the company making the game did a bad!
---
For me every game is full.
---
Yeah, I believe they meant to have a simultaneous release, pushed back Wastelanders at the last hour yet continued to run with the sub plan. Not saying it makes it any better or worse, but it would've been accepted more readily.  
---
It's like a miniaturized "mmo" that's had a year without anything close to an expansion. I don't really blame anyone losing trust in Beth. They have a lot to make up for in good will with Wastelanders. 
---
And absolutely agree modders should have an avenue for profit. I think a voluntary pay the artist what you believe is worth, within your budget/finsbcisk situation. Obviously no way to be enforced, but people tend to want to be able to support modders who otherwise voluntarily give their time to create something.  Placing that behind a paywall will almost always distort the creation.
---
The execution was definitely awful.
---
Pay some money on a game you enjoy = worthy of literal harassment I guess.
---
Ok but explain how that justifies bullying people
---
TLDR Version: &lt;speaking Chinese&gt;
---
When I was doing the ammo grind I would hold Grafton Steel whenever I played.  It's a huge a difference.  You can still farm while the workshop produces for you.  I found the Acid and Nuclear Waste workshops also super useful.
---
You are so clear... Thanks.
---
Good deal. Wonder if they've improved rewards? What sort of plans are dropping?
---
How the fuck would you know the players number?
---
Where are you able to see the active playercount? Is it an Xbox live/ PSN thing you can look up?
---
Uhh... Okay? You realize I'm point out that Myron was very likely lying about having invented Jet, right? But go ahead and keep being butthurt about lore that was never actually reliable to begin with.
---
we do, But between my night classes, him taking care of his mom and his step father, we don’t exactly get to drive to see each other much
---
Very nice! My favorite kill was the other week. Killed it in one hit while it was sleeping and it flew away from me like 30 feet. The breathing sound didn't stop after it died.
---
May we all have friendships like this.  Loved the story.  You don’t need a reason, not do you ever have to defend, enjoying your life the way you want to.
---
Just so you are aware, this is incorrect. Both “Stings and Things” and the “Tidy” quest give Possum badges. I do both of these pretty much every day to earn Possum badges, and I get them from both, although the drop rate is usually abysmal.
---
playercounter.com not 100% accurate, but it's close enough.
---
Is this real?
---
Imagine being this angry over a fucking video game. Put some of that rage to real world problems.
---
TLDR version: &lt;speaking Chinese&gt;
---
That's fair.  It just seemed weird that a couple of miles kept you from seeing each other more often.
---
It cures depression too
---
One must give tadpole... because I have 6 pf them and have bought everything in the machine...
---
Dude, that's not supporting bethesda, that's supporting your friend. If anything, bethesda took a perfectly good routine between two friends and monetized it for an extra 100 bucks.
---
How have you gained 41 levels without learning that you can sell things to vendors for 1400 caps a day?
---
As one Floop to another, I think you're wrong there. Playing since day one, I see the changes Bethesda has made. I was there when it was a buggy snoozefest. I was also there the day the game began improving. It's gonna get better. It's not there yet, but it will be. And it needs support and non-hostile communication with its actual playerbase, not astroturfing neggers who don't even play the game. They want to see the shitshow and pile on. You should write up some feedback reports, Bethesda actively reads those. Half of the content we have wouldn't exist if they didn't
---
I probably under shot the number of miles between each other.  granted, 30 isn’t a huge amount, but it can be enough when you add family comittments into the mix
---
Whats taking so long? I've done it 1000x. I do know that managing the inventory itself takes time. As long as you have some space, just scrap all and bundle and go if you are in a hurry. Yes there is too much time sorting, selling to vendor, etc.
---
I remember when online games first started too. The only *free* ones were text based MUDs and MUCKs and the like. And, hell, by 1993 or 94 even some of *them* were pay-to-play. WoW which everyone likes to hold up as a standard launched with buying the base game which gave you 30 days of “free” play and then you had to pay more every month at minimum just to keep playing. Anyone saying its normal for online games to be completely free is lying.
---
That's actually a really cool tool. Thanks!
---
Paying for a game and having shit server stability. Being told you need to pay to have server stability. Priceless.
---
Grafton steel wound up being farming the super mutants for the steel, then I found uranium fever. Now, with the scrapper upgrade, steel is never an issue, except in having too much? 
---
True, but in my experience holding 3 of those workshops wasnt difficult and not often challenged by pvp.
---
I’m not sure how you got the tadpole badges, but I know I do both quests almost daily and they have only ever award possum badges. I’ve never gotten a tadpole badge from them.
---
Literally laughed out loud 😆
---
This. That rifle Is bugged.  A 50 cal hunting rifle, Max level and all Rifleman perks hit around that. It would be interesting for OP to craft an idéntical rifle and compare.
---
Reminds me of the "Don't you have phones" line. Sure, I do, but it's a hastle to transfer items and I've lost a lot of good stuff doing it.
---
You must be bloody
---
Morons can't all be in prison, unfortunately they also play fallout
---
I just got the lion statues, which I wanted for months now.
---
Works best if you happen to still have Rose's syringer....
---
I just wanted to bring it up. I wouldn’t trade the life I have for anything, but he and I don’t get to hang out much except on games anymore. 
---
I just wanted people to know that some of us who are willing to deal with everything going on are doing it because to us, the friendship comes first. Not that fallout was our bond (actually magic the gathering is what made us friends) but that this is acting as a glue to help keep us tougher despite the miles
---
If someone likes something there's no reason they should get hate for it I'm not saying the game is flawless i do think somethings could be improved on but so far I'm loving it and if i like something i support it.
---
It's my mule. I made my level 350 my mule with unyileding wwr armor. I just log in to cash scrip.
---
I'm a super sharing person, but even I considered attacking them, at least nuking their bases - hey they got the scrap to repair right? Lol!
---
You're getting griefed so much that part of your decision in buying first was to get away from a public server to avoid regular griefing? Why do you think youre getting griefed that consistently as its not due soley to being a firster.
---
I better start doing both then! Thanks!
---
so you dont even care about the fact that theres another vault on the map? theres also a whole questline that may or may not already be activated to give you a bunch of pre wastelanders info. A huge part of the development team is currently working on wastelanders and we have other things coming including the current halloween event and a thanksgiving event and a christmas event.
---
If being Chinese means not bowing down to Bethesda's greed then I guess Im Chinese now.
---
Praise be to Mao.
---
But try to remember what it was like at launch.  Pepperidge Farm remembers.  Pepperidge Farm remembers how everyone was shitting on Fallout 4 when it first came out.  Pepperidge Farm remembers the cries of #NotMyFallout. Pepperidge Farm also remembers how it went on to become Game of the Year.  Sound familiar?
---
Perhaps, but I’m willing to pay for it.  Fallout is our glue (that and Magic the Gathering) and not that we don’t have any other connections, but these our our strongest
---
Didn't think it had to be pointed out... The 1st players literally ARE the problem.  There would be no issue to begin with if you dummies weren't throwing your money away for what was supposed to be free, but now it's not because of you.
---
Get the scraper perk and scrap assault and laser rifles get a tone of steel and plastic sell the steel for 1 cap each and the plastic for 2  you can get a tone from killing super mutants at a low level place like top of the world
---
but..fallout 76 actually gives you more atoms then you could get normally for the price...
---
I said part of the problem. Im not giving grief. I will reiterate, all Im trying to say is consumers have the power. Its clear this whole ordeal is completely unethical. All the investors want are people fall for it, that is all they care about. Its clear they care for nothing else when it comes to this particular title. For some reason, consumers are so oblivious to the fact, they will blindly just keep throwing money at them and for what exactly? Some extra credits for the in game store which is filled with absurdly overpriced items.   
---
In a hypothetical situation, BGS and investors would be utterly shocked if noone subs to FO1st. So much so, it would force them to change everything.   
---
So yeah, consumers that blindly just go "eh, why not" justify the companies actions and are more than likely, in my opinion are part of the problem. Going back to my overall point, that consumers have the power.
---
Yes, do both for sure. It helps your chances, but like I said, the drop rate is horrible. It has taken me literally 2 weeks or more to get 5 badges the past 2 times I’ve gathered 5 of them.
---
I think your miss understanding me. I bought my own server as well. I’m talking about ppl crying about private servers and spending money on it. Trolls are bitching and down voting subs when they see ppl happy with spending the money they’ve earned on what they want.
---
Because it is an objective advantage over others, and negated the purpose of virtually all weight reduction perks. Weigh management becomes irrelevant,which has been a vital part of these types of games.
---
The problem is that dumbasses who spend money on crap like that encourage developers to make microtransaction-ridden shitshows instead of good games
---
I dont ever remember caps being that important. Or scarce. Now I spend all day vendor hopping trying to spend caps faster than the vendor makes them, so hold on, it gets easier.
---
Mine always lags for a solid 10-15 seconds at least. One time I think it froze for full minute. But comlletley freezing because of this has been pretty rare for me. Still really needs to be addressed tho, along side many other things
---
You make a rabid fan sad, you could make a GROWN MAN feel had! Make a man start feelin BAD! But in the end itll be me thats glad!
---
1. Why are you comparing sports events to video games?
---
2. Well I don't know how you do things in America, but here in the EU that kind of sale or advertising would probably be illegal.
---
3. I honestly have no idea what this has to do with Fallout 76 and Bethesda.
---
Why don't you make some honest comparisons instead. Compare this video game (FO76) to other video games out there. Are any other video game companies doing what Bethesda are currently doing? Can you think of any?
---
That is similar to my experience after it was fixed up to 2 weeks ago. Now no badge in 2 weeks. Hopefully the luck will turn around!
---
My butt is okay, thank you. I was almost assraped by paid (THE LIE) private servers, but I avoided that. If you want to believe that lore before Bethesda is unreliable then that's great.
---
yeah. i'd say it's a good general view if community numbers are going up or down but nothing 100%
---
surprised you never saw one of those before now..
---
yeah that makes sense, attack the people who are paying for your server usage.
---
I wouldnt go that far and if they needed the money to finish wastelanders or extend this game by 6 months thats bad news for us all. Paying or not.
---
&gt;How dare they pay into the game so everyone else keeps getting the rest of it for free...
---
Weird, I have a pretty large number of MMO survival games that I paid less for than 76 that haven't tried to con me out of a monthly sub to keep playing. Ones that have a massive number of single players on a server in comparison to 76.
---
When Fallout 76 first started if gave me hope that not all people were assholes with advanced players helping new players just coming from the vault. It's now a totally different game it seems...
---
playercounter.com
---
I, too, would like to see a source for this.
---
Yeah, bummed about that one.
---
I'm getting griefed in the first place because there's a group of children who don't like me and a few friends because they violated a bunch of discord rules and ended up getting banned. I'm getting griefed now by people who AREN'T part of that group as well because I'm a first subscriber. I don't want to just play by myself I actually enjoy most of the interactions with people I have in the game, but I'm being forced to do this now. I also bought it because i like supporting the game, The atom deal is really great, I end up holding a lot of junk and wondering why i can't move all the time, I like the emotes that come with it, etc.
---
Weight reduction perks are virtually useless because you are never more than a few steps from storage. And having so much more access to junk allows you to craft much more and faster, which is an objective advantage over those that dont pay for the feature. Aka, pay to win.
---
What, if hear me out. That there is another communist base other than the one for the food production company?
---
cept the ones who are trying to harass fallout first users
---
thats not very nice.
---
yay for private solo worlds lol
---
if it was said lightheartedly, it's funny. If they were being a jerk, then f anyone who acts like this.
---
NOTHING about what the first players are getting was supposed to be free. The fact that you think that just goes to show exactly how unaware of everything you actually are. Nothing in the package was ever said to be free or even implied.
---
I feel bad for ya.  Not for wasting your money, but for not having the wits to understand why you shouldn't have.
---
Also, don’t forget to do Campfire Tales when it pops up. That’s another chance for a possum badge. Since they have reworked the public event timing I’m hoping that event comes up more often than it has been since they started public events.
---
i feel ya. i have a decades old appreciation for fallout lore. game doesn't have to be good or successful to still enjoy. the drama is that a less than aaa game charged aaa prices, has aaa micro-transactions and now has aaa sub fees. if this was a great all around game experience the community around it wouldn't be so toxic.
---
i agree. i played the beta and then got it on sale on the pc.
---
there ARE some major issues. but private servers if you have zero friends on your list do work
---
guns seem to be broken for me tho lol...but i got muh axe!
---
i like the world i like how you can just go at your own pace maybe theres not a ton of quest/npc/story content but its still a huge world to explore  (bigger then fallout 4) 
---
and that is what makes the game NOT shit.
---
oh yeah.?   well guess just stay on my private server ....where the Fallout 2nd Players can't get me.....Fallout 1St AD VICTORIAM!
---
Yeahh I bought 1st because I was just about to buy 1100 atoms for 10 bucks anyway so I could buy those dollar store halloween decorations that cost more in game than they do in real life. I'll admit i felt a little ashamed haha. And then when I made my wastelander armor, I ran off behind a building so nobody could see me put it on 😆 It felt so dirty! 😩 I'm sorry, community, I've failed you! I'm so weak! My GT is BIack Earth . please somebody come destroy my camp and T bag my scrap assaultrons' lifeless body 😵
---
Nah cringe pretty much nails it.
---
must be dumbass kids who think this way. players should be thanking those paying these fees. Some sort of boycott isn't going to do anything. Beth isn't doing this to be malicious, they are doing it out of ignorance of a better way. That's not going to change. The people making these decisions aren't going anywhere, but fo76 could shutter and without the Bethesda servers, there is no more fo76. Some of you need to think about this.
---
tl;dr: I dun git capitolizm, i jus know God and gunz and anglish
---
See, we're just being petty at this point. Have a nice day fella.
---
You're lying lmao
---
Some people don't want their hobby destroyed.
---
I know, EVERYONE is doing it now, I went to the gas station and filled up with gas and noticed they sell PREMIUM GAS TOO FOR MORE MONEY! I was outraged!
---
Bought an airline ticket, and they had a FIRST CLASS seat that you had to pay more for! THE GAUL!
---
And the WORST by FAR! Went into the grocery store, and bought a box of store brand food, and they were selling name brand food FOR MORE MONEY!
---
Like a shovel? Happens sometimes.
---
Lol I’m playing the game now and so far it’s awesome. I think the game is awesome. Yeah I miss the npcs but it’s still good.
---
You don't actually play the game obviously
---
ZENIMAX  is calling the shots on this premium version, which is all it is. Pay more get more. What people should try to understand is how ZENIMAX planned on FO76 being an MMO type game when it comes to it's business model. Much like ESO, so people that have been playing sub based games or f2p MMOs with cash shops and premium services will not be shocked, upset and just see it as more the same. Which may not be a large part of fallout fans, thus they may expect different things.  When they try charging a sub to play content patches get the pitchforks, otherwise you're just yelling at an mmo publisher (ZENIMAX) for using a business model that they have always used. And in honesty back when in development they stated that this was what was going to happen. Patches will be free, vast content free, item shops and premium service. Eso does it, EQ still does it, Wow is still sub only. And released 15 year old content that you have to pay the subscription to play. Everyone cheers!
---
You said this was your first time playing which is false :)
---
Oh I have, but not to the point that I see 5 in one West Tek run. It’s at an entirely new level.
---
If this had occured a few weeks ago I would suggest it might be a lead up to Wastelanders but now I can't imagine a reason at all.
---
this maths makes sense
---
And that’s where I am. i see bugs. Shoot the other day my buddy and I even on the personal server had some bugs with the chat.  I don’t care though. We worked through it because we had a game to both play.
---
Not that I’ll just throw my cash at Bethesda...but if I can get an experience that my buddy and I can experience together I will do it. Or at least have the way point set up for him
---
Agreed.  I’m not sure how much longer it will be around.  Clearly they are lacking resources they need, and that’s likely due to lack of funding. Unfortunately due to the lack of resources, I think the game’s fate is sealed.  I hope I’m wrong.
---
Damn, we got chance up on here layin it down
---
Yea saw the posts talking about that the people who attack fallout 1st members for subscribing are just pathetic assholes
---
thinking guy says "cant be greifed if your alone on your private server" 
---
;-)
---
Maybe a communist bundle
---
This is marketing 101. Read carefully, assume anything not specifically and clearly mentioned to be NOT included.  The specific word here being "content"
---
This only includes missions, maps, and game modes. However many have chosen for it to mean more. As in absolutely everything ever. Classic mistake.
---
Consumers should be careful and always assume any offer to be excluding anything possible, definitely not inclusive of any possible twist.
---
I seriously can't believe that you sincerely think that Black Isle couldn't have made any of their characters liars, even when Myron LITERALLY lies to the main character in the game. Do you know how story mechanics like unreliable narrators work?
---
&gt;smaller key resellers don't.
---
Shocking! You mean to tell me that shady fucking companies who profit off of selling keys bought with stolen credit cards aren't paying their taxes? Whodathunk?
---
10% tax for Todd
---
someone else reported this issue. i think....too
---
do you have any other friends in your friends list? they could have hopped on and looted it.
---
or maybe a bug? lol
---
Try /r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Ever heard of “ignorance is bliss”?  Not sure why it’s necessary for the blind man who smiles to be given eyes so he can frown with the rest.  Happiness is hard enough to find in this world.  If this is their forever game be happy for them, not sad for yourself.  Plenty of other games to choose from.  ...and there is no such thing as a forever game.
---
I usually would have someone take them after a few hours.  Even if they're trash they can just keep contesting and force you to either leave the server or babysit them.  I'm on PS4 so it's probably worse for that.  Plus I'm assuming private servers are more stable so you don't have to worry about disconnects.
---
But anyway my point is you can farm like crazy for a month and avoid paying the year subscription.
---
Yeahp. Nuka spot too.
---
You’re arguing one company is evil and the other benevolent over **$7**?  lol
---
And this is more of what I'm talking about. The fact that people think its okay to grief other players at all is a problem and is actually against the Bethesda/Zenimax ToS/CoC
---
mine seems to just not work nearly at all. like it does either little or no damage but SOMETIMES it might actually hit.
---
i just said fuck it and scrapped all muh guns and just use axes and stuffs thankfully i put some spec in strength..
---
The truth is*
---
Right. This is my first time playing the game. I started playing today and I’ve been playing it all day
---
Ill give ya a nickle, to lick mah pickle. I AM DOLEMITE!
---
Pretty much sums up why most players found this game a flop at or near "endgame"
---
Every and any update to directly effect gameplay was to be free of charge (only exception being cosmetics), therefore this update would not have come with a fee had you stuck to your guns.
---
not sure but doing good so far in adventure...
---
guns seem to be not working well for me so .. scrapped them and gone melee! lol
---
Therefore, you're just a corporate shill, unable to think for yourself and doomed to a life of mediocrity and sheepishness. So terrible you've been brainwashed by...something, I can't keep up.You sad fucker.
---
Do not fix the nuke mine.
---
wow this is pretty fucking accurate.
---
thats why i like private servers to play alone ;-)
---
Sorry, mate.
---
Collateral damage involved here.
---
Idea of having the beth supporters hunted = love this.
---
Collectors edition, beta tester here.
---
Was hoping until Fallout 1st.
---
Now going rogue once i log in. If ever.
---
If I had gold I would have given it to you for this point you made.
---
I see. Neat!
---
Apparently lol
---
I feel same. Everything hinges on wastelanders now, thatll tell us all if this thing can make 2 years.
---
That is ENTIRELY incorrect. They never stated that EVER, just that DLC would be free of charge and that specifically is (WIld Appalachia, Nuclear Winter, Wastelanders). This is what i mean by people are expecting everything to be free and refusing to acknowledge that they only said that about specific things.
---
i assume they become captured when you log out and log back into the private server yes?
---
i wanna try to capture one or two but im still just level 7 i think.
---
sort of, been happening for a few weeks now
---
Yep the world is the best storage.
---
I'm in the same boat. Having played Fallout 76 since launch, and thoroughly enjoying it, I feel that it has become a bit stale lately. I will absolutely be jumping back in for Wastelanders, and I'll probably keep playing infrequently just to keep up to date and play seasonal events. I've got decent armour, weapons, I've been everywhere, all I'm doing is grinding caps to buy all the serum recipes, and getting Possum Badges to buy all the upgrades.
---
What Fallout 76 did though was inspire me to play Fallout 4 survival mode. I can handle diseases, food, water etc in 76, why not give it a crack in Fallout 4? I started last night. I know it'll be harder (got killed by the first mob of raiders because I rushed in like an idiot), but I think it'll be a good challenge.
---
Oh, and my biggest gripe from 76 is way better in Fallout 4. Food crafting is QUICK! I'm so sick of eating dog food! If I could cook my meat and vegetables faster in 76, I'd have a more varied diet.
---
Don’t grief just stop playing and uninstall
---
Nope. Enjoy your 43% suicide rate, 68% of all syphilis cases, and as a lesbian, being 4x more likely to abuse your child
---
well if your playing solo on a private server not really a big deal lol
---
&gt; Reddit isn’t too priority for input as it’s has become a place to rant
---
It's also not indicative of their actual player base. If you only read this sub you'd be convinced that literally everyone and their grandma hated FO 1st, but given how many randy outfits and scrap boxes I've seen the last few days that obviously isn't the case.
---
They don't like anyone who doesn't waste $20 on shitty cosmetics
---
i do it for the private servers i dont care to be play to win and break the public ones.
---
i just want to have fun and go at my own pace without worrying about spawn camping ....annoying players and other issues lol
---
Hmmm should I hack this computer? Umm flip.my perks around 2 times? Screw the computer.
---
they be jelly
---
i is happy in my private server alone ;-)
---
Rofl you are clueless man, it's a fact and there is proof that this was in fact said.  You think everyone is in an uproar based off false claims?? What a clown.
---
Got old quick I'd imagine
---
agreed.
---
yup
---
they be jellly :-p
---
Always been the case
---
&gt;Fallout 1st has provoked near universal disdain. 
---
Maybe on this sub, but I'm seeing at least 30-40% of player camps having scrap boxes, so outside this astroturfed echo chamber there is a large chunk of the player base that actually paid for the service.
---
Yes, I had been stuck, but finally got the night vision camera yesterday.
---
I got one earlier today.
---
If you have the cannibal perk you can actually eat the rich
---
Do they know if we are playing less?
---
Yeah I think over time, shown by me seeiing more valseeks on Forums and less LoneVaultWanderer here, they know it’s a venting and circlejerk platform as opposed to feedback. Comparing Reddit to the forums this week opened my eyes to it.
---
&gt;My concern now is will this modding philosophy carry over to Starfield and TES VI?
---
Considering this is what, the third attempt by Bethesda for paid for modding? (Original Steam Workshop one for Skyrim, then Creation Club for both Fallout 4 and Skyrim Very Special Edition, and now this.)  
---
Pretty damned high.
---
With average salary about $1000. So if you want it, welcome :)
---
Look at a game like fortnite where, and I don't play fortnite so I'm just googling this shit, you have player skins going for 1200 or so each.  Their premium currency is priced roughly the same as Bethesda prices atoms so that's essentially $12 a skin.
---
Also if you look at these packages Bethesda's offering for $10 you're getting an outfit + 1500 atoms, 1500 atoms can buy you two more outfits so you're actually getting three for about $3.33 each
---
Definitely a lot more calming. And you can still withdrawal from the scrap bin after you sub expires
---
I'll gladly get the subscription when they put the armor in the Atom Shop, the scrap box in the base game, and the forward tent behind a quest with skins for it in the Atom Shop. As would many others, if the upvotes every time I say this are any indication. 
---
It's not that the subscription itself costs money. It's that the subscription has things in it that should be available for everyone, regardless of their subscription status, and yet aren't available for everyone unless they subscribe. This isn't rocket science. I'm beginning to think you Fallout 1st defenders are deliberately not actually paying attention to what any of us say because you don't want to admit that Bethesda sold you a wet sack of shit and you ate it right up.
---
The game had many many problems. Turned away most players. The ones who remained really tried to have a good time for themselves! Negative people largely left. I'm on xbox, and I've had nothing but positive experiences.. with that said, I do wish people talked to me more on their. It seems to be complete silence from most everyone. But silence is better than negativity! Glad you're liking it so far!
---
How would be get all that sweet outrage karma if he didn't tell people he was quitting?
---
Could be new alts too.
---
ESO wasn’t a $60 game when it launched. It was when it launched on consoles, but it was also a much more complete game.
---
YouTube gaming channels are the worst. When this game came out, even with its bugs and mess these guys hopped on the train to bash town real fast. Even before the game released they talked about the fact it was going to fail. They created the hate hype we see now.
---
 I'll give credit where its due, some of them re-reviewed it after it improved, but the ones pushing the hard hate stayed silent. They jumped on the next bad game, then as soon as something else bad happened in 76 they went right back to bashing it. I bet half of the channels who hate on this game won't even talk about wastelanders after it releases if it does good. Only if it does bad.
---
To them it's not about the game or the companies pulling some shady shit. It's about the clicks. Those clicks are their revenue. And nothing brings clicks like controversy and outrage. 
---
Unfortunately with that you have the people who are going to mimic their shit word for word and they flock to the reddit to spew their garbage. To them it's not about making change to a game they dont even play, its about being assholes to those who do play and actually want change. Sadly even the people who do want change, but are angry, get lost in the waves of assholes.
---
There are reasons to be upset and their are reasons to complain and ask for better, but putting people down because they enjoy something you don't, is childish and these people clearly never grew up. 
---
Critisisim is only constructive when it's a conversation, not when you are a bully.
---
Time for a "Red Scare"
---
What do you mean pay to win? Reread original post. It says "making scrap weigh zero **for all players**..."
---
The game is easily grinable with things like crimson masterminds for sums of money people praise rockstar for free updates but the shark cards are expected because they stil need profit
---
The game at the start very well couldve been my favorite game ever! It really started to drag for me around level 45 or 50. But that was still weeks and weeks of great entertainment. And even after it's fun every now and then! I hope you continue to have a great time!
---
sign me up!
---
It only for PC games, unfortunately. Playstation, Microsoft and Nintendo don’t have regional prices and games have are fully $60 cost.
---
i think it will still be free. and i think it will come out
---
and im glad they didnt delay private servers lol
---
i dont know why someone is screaming near those cabins and the ground is shaking
---
and at this point im too afraid to ask.
---
I have opened up on her as she exits the Fissure before, taking her below 50%, and she still Morphed to Legendary, then immediately regenerated.
---
Man I’m more so jealous that I’m paying 150 a year for elder scrolls online + and fallout first is only 100. But on a really note, how does this effect the game I haven’t played fallout 76 yet. On elder scrolls online I actually don’t mind the subscription I get to play all the dlcs with out buying them and get a unlimited crafting bag and free in game currency. 
---
Does the sub make better to play and people just don’t want to pay or is it really no difference and a bunch of bs?
---
That sucks. 
---
No issues on my private servers. 
---
Legendaries galore. Some 3* dropping 1* weapons though. Kinda lame.
---
Thats disappointing. Sorry your having annoying experiences like that. The firster stuff will die down quick and that should sort itself out. With survival gone people seem to need any reason now. Ive noticed an uptick in people trying to instigate lately and im not a firster. Hopefully it works out and you get some peace with your subscription, thats worth the price imo.
---
Here's the hypocrisy of this post. You hate it when Fallout 1st subscribers get griefed in game but can't find a single fuck to give when those same Fallout 1st subscribers tell people on Reddit "you must be poor" or "begone peasant" when those people express their dislike for Fallout 1st.
---
Uh I paid $80 for the imperial edition which stiffed me twenty bucks for a race which should have been included in the base game. I am on console though. Besides, that game is way more of a rip-off, it has nothing in common with the other ES games, just an ES skin tacked onto a generic mmo. At least 76 plays like FO4
---
You say that as if it being 25 hours instead of 15 is anything to swoon at.
---
You say there is fact and proof. Then link it here. Show everyone. If you can't then how can anyone believe that what you're saying isn't you just spouting shit specifically to get people more riled up.
---
🙄
---
Whoa there butthurt
---
Maybe 2014 was the last time i played battlefield and cod. These games have teams so you know whom the enemy are. I never understood pvp, especially winning losing caps in fallout 76.
---
I think creating a separate character especially because of pvp with a shitty little camp and minimal caps is the ticket. Supply and transfer to the minimal character with legendarys from your own main characters stash.
---
Thanks. Yeah, I shouldn't have. But the Ranger Armor.... I wanted it since launch lol.
---
Bethesda knew exactly what they were doing. Offering that as part of this subscription guaranteed thousands of purchased. I see 3-5 Rangers per event. So it seems to have been very successful.
---
I'm calling bullshit. Poseidon is level locked at 10-15 depending on the enemies. There's no way a high level player caused a bunch on high level scorched to spawn.
---
The only thing that's sad is people who post hate.
---
Not saying it’s worth it but 12 bucks is a pretty bad hooker and this for a month
---
Sure sound salty. You can keep your homophobia.
---
You get plans for taking workshops?
---
they need to add more stuff with atoms for fallout first members to get
---
lol
---
People have the right to support a policy that is p2w. People also have the right to fuck with them ingame as a reaction towards that. So fuck anyone who buys 1st. When i see one i will do anything possible so the game becomes unbearable for them. Best way to achieve that is usually spam bright stuff in their face not only to make it unbearable for the eyes but also reduce their fps. If trying to talk to Bethesda or quitting the game doesnt work then the only solution left is to make the multiplayer unenjoyable.
---
&gt;As I understand from your suggestion If I left and relog to my private server it is still the same server. But what happens if I relog with diffirent character?
---
Same server. I've used the feature several times to move stuff from one character to another.
---
a solo game ?
---
but woudnt that defeat the purpose of battle royale?
---
match begins
---
i win by default yay!
---
i mean i have a slight problems with wanting all the cool things since i never experienced them in other fallouts as this is my first one so the atoms are a nice bonus. i spend most of my time doing datamining, bug finding/reporting, exploit finding/reporting, and general tool development for people so i also dont even get to play that much anymore, it just frustrates me to no end that everyone is so toxic about the whole situation while i sit here trying to help the game actively get better.
---
Yes and no, I just got out of a game with people flying around and 1 shooting....That being said I sniped killed one so...
---
Possibly. Keep in mind though that this thing just debuted.  If it follows the typical pattern for newly released material,  then 30-40 percent represents peak usage.   In a few more months it will be down to 10-20 percent or possibly less. 
---
Survival, NW, Sheepsquatch etc. were tried by everyone out of the gate, then quickly diminished.    And they were all  free additions. 
---
I could be wrong, but we shall have to see.
---
i like their worlds
---
remember it all started with the Elder Scrolls I Arena
---
it was a buggy mess but had a massive world
---
they are just sticking with their roots ;-)
---
Yes. Since beta.
---
They axed it so there would be a sudden influx of Survival players griefing Adventure players and ruining their passive playstyle so that they'd be forced to pay for their newest weaponized pay to play microtransaction.
---
You bought the game right? So aren’t you as well? Thought I’d see if server stability was any better in solo.
---
It wasn’t. Bought outer worlds. Moved on.
---
You should probably move on too
---
I don't mind so much if its a challenge CAMP, I don't like the floating boxes.
---
I’ve never woken up there I hope my camp doesn’t affect that!
---
In a solo game you launch a nuke. When you go to white springs the first time, there should be live ghouls there.
---
Is there a lot to understand?
---
An unsourced article from Forbes? I bet you're one of those morons who thinks Ukraine should investigate the Bidens, and that Hillary ran a child sex ring from the basement of a pizza shop.
---
If you quickly jump out &amp; back in again, it's supposed to fix it
---
I remember watching as my buddy cleared the mobs out, and allowed the destruction of megaton
---
a waste-land of money
---
Fortnite has things going on like seasons, packages that cost an amount and give you a reward of skins depending how well you do. 20 dollars or so and you could earn well over 10 skins and other cosmetics by putting down under the potential of not getting it. 
---
Aside from marketing schemes BGS has a different metric because they have huge modding scenes where there are thousands of high quality outfits for free. They need to at least compete in quality, originality, or be worth their price. Creation Club failed to do this and 76 doesn't have much of a modding scene. 
---
The bundles are worthwhile looking at it like that but that's still a large up front cost. 
---
What I'm saying is that the up front cost is too much for the quality, originality, or just not worth it when there were free alternatives just makes it not be worth it. It's a bit different for 76 since there isn't a free option for the game but it still stings when Fallout 4 had a free option.
---
It is not a battle pass it is more like minecraft realms
---
In a solo game you launch a nuke and head for white springs... for the first time.
---
There should be live ghouls there.
---
Is there really a lot to understand?
---
all the old fans just stopped caring, new fans who weren't accustomed to better standards came along and decided fo4 was the new benchmark.
---
Stop playing a shit game
---
Exactly i don't understand why people get hate on for liking it people are allowed to like things others don't if someone likes something you don't like it's fine to express an opinion just don't be an ass about it
---
it was kind of a shit hole to be honest :-p
---
I'm not butthurt because I'm not condoning Bethesda to do this shit. You keep paying them for stupid things like this they will just want more and more of your money they just want to suck you dry. These features SHOULD be in the game for free considering it was all promised before the game even launched.
---
Nah they’ll just add Creation Club into 76 with a separate currency than Atoms
---
Same. I've never run into any bugs with this game at all though, so I guess I've just blessed by the atom.
---
You don't have to build them 50 feet in the air, or fill them with missile turrets or make them a 10x10 empty metal box though.
---
Are you seriously trying to say that an MMO set in the ES universe is a rip off because it has nothing to do with the other games? 
---
It was literally marketed as an MMO in the Elder Scrolls universe, and plays differently from every other big MMO on the market. 
---
From the sounds of it, you expected Skyrim with Friends, and have never played another MMO(or just don’t know what generic means.)
---
I think you’re just upset that it wasn’t the game you wanted, even though ZOS marketed it by saying it wasn’t an Elder Scrolls game.
---
I paid it for the ranger outfit and disabled my sub right after. No different from spending on atoms to buy a cool outfit on the store.
---
16 times the detail
---
Didn't know I could have a boyfriend and be homophobic *big thonk*
---
I had the reverse happen, two 1st players decided to bother me while I was simply building a fitting base, and I kept being griefed, so now it is on, I will hunt those that support terrible practices with EXTREME fury.
---
&gt;People also have the right to fuck with them 
---
No, they don't.  Think if the target was you son, daughter, brother, sister or whatever.  This ugly mob mentality is everything that is wrong in gaming and in this world. 
---
&gt; So fuck anyone who buys 1st. When i see one i will do anything possible so the game becomes unbearable for the
---
You're just a straight up bully, not some righteous crusader fighting the power. I actually pitty people like you that have nothing positive in their lives.  You're just a punk. Feel free to try it with me ingame, I'll happily out your scrap from your paper bag into my stash. Come on big boi, bring it, we'll see who PVPs better.
---
Yeah, the bourgeois definitely struggle.
---
\*deal
---
Not company.
---
And yes, the price point is what determines the deal's value. And it's an $8 difference.
---
Math and thinking are difficult, I guess? I could forgive the former if gamers simply applied the latter more often.
---
But vapid rebuttals are easier, so you do you.
---
I’ve run servers for a lot of different games. A cheap VPS was perfectly fine for single digit players on all of them. And again, I understand that servers cost money, but if I’m paying to rent a server, I expect a 24/7 persistent server, not an instance that resets when I log out.
---
Next month they release the anti-materiel rifle and you dunces go for it again.
---
You mean the behind the scenes stuff Bethesda makes shows Bethesda people care? Wow. I need to sit down for a moment. I thought for sure they would release a video of the development team taking dumps on lists of player's names and raucous parties. 
---
Sarcasm aside, I'm pretty sure your average coder, animator, artist, tester, (if they bothered to use them for this project) HATES what Bethesda has done. They probably DON'T want their name on this buggy, unfinished, money grabbing mess. They're just doing their job. 
---
The responsibility for all of this nonsense falls on A-holes like Todd Howard, Pete Hines, and the board members who willfully make these bad decisions in spite of their audience, even when it means taking something they promised the community and going "so what?"
---
Its in the description for the vending machines in build mode. They take 10% of the caps from what ever you sell.
---
You want factions... we can give you factions...
---
Doesn't justify bullying. No one should be bullied for buying F1st. However, they should be subject to reasoned arguments regarding why the service and their purchase of it is an overall bad thing for gaming.
---
I got it for the ranger armor lol big fan of new vegas I'm definitely gonna keep it on renew seem like a good deal with the atoms and private worlds plus they will probably have more exclusive outfits for it
---
Do you get to keep the icon too?
---
And I know it's old now but they got my $12.99 and had to fork it back over 2 days later since the refund transfer came through and is no longer pending. I'll enjoy the free atoms and cosmetics. I'll thank bugthesda for paying for my snack run on movie night though, was really nice of them...
---
You can be homophonic towards lesbians which you have demonstrated. Gay men not giving a fuck about other LGBT people isn’t new.
---
Fucking got em...I guess?
---
I think everything you claim you get to keep, minus the things like survival tent and scrap box
---
Yes you do
---
I might do that and just for that stuff then cancel
---
good
---
damn that sucks man far harbor was by far the best content in fo4 imo.
---
I like it :)
---
Thanks
---
I might do that for the stuff and cancel as well
---
Woo hoo another bug filled wreck of content intended to launch with the game.  Everything we have gotten has been half assed, nothing has gone over smoothly.
---
Yea I'm loving it im glad i got it really excited for the wastelanders update next year maybe then more people will give it a chance
---
Lol. If they do, yeah. I will go for it.
---
i am the lone ranger since i am the only one in my private server ;-)
---
yup its not bad i mean sure they could have charged atoms for the armor on the shop but eh its a nice little perk lol
---
I'm only against griefing people who bought it because I don't know if maybe the person on the other end is a kid whosee parents bought them F1 because they really love 76, maybe you're griefing a 12 year old. Maybe it's somebody who got gifted it. 
---
Like in theory, if I knew that the people with F1 icons had bought it to be "better" or to show support for that train wreck of a game, I'd be 100% OK with griefing then as a form of protest against both Bethesda and the p2w concept for F1.
---
But since I can't know who is on the other side of that screen I can't condone it.
---
For better or worse, Todd has made himself a celebrity at Bethesda. That means he's the face, for better or worse since he shows up at the announcements, does interviews, and in general, sells the game. As for Pete Hines, he's the asshole who made all these proclamations about cosmetics only, and not charging for future content. 
---
It's 100% okay to shovel the crap back into their face when they are the ones to throw it in ours.
---
Still won't do the trick. Tried putting the Spotlight on front on a Pylon to see if it does earlier detection and a missile turret next to it. Won't attack until it's really close.
---
Customer support in a nutshell...
---
Dillon!?
---
Gj puppet.
---
As I understand it, each World is an "Instance" on a server, not actually an entire Server, so each Server can have some given number of Instances active at any time, Each Instance refreshes at some interval, which is relatively seamless from the players perspective, and servers are likely re-booted periodically based on performance, if a server is having issues we get a notification that the server is shutting down soon, but if the server has a cascading failure, we get booted without warning. It stands to reason that a limited number of players in each instance (8 in the case of Private Servers) would be less taxing, and with the limited information Bethesda has provided, it appears that each instance gets assigned as needed for either Public or Private use.
---
All of this makes sense when you consider how frequently you can join a server, invite a friend and find out you just joined a full world. The biggets difference I've seen with the Private worlds is how easy it is to get several friends together at once.
---
Reread my post. Keep up next time.
---
I agree. I like how random people will help you or you can join a event. I was in a event to kill the grafton monster and two randoms came to help. That was much appreciated.
---
Preach it brotha!
---
Well there’s no accounting for good taste apparently.
---
Nah. Cancelled my subscription. I don’t support P2W content.
---
did the run on normal server yesterday at westek outside was a crown,inside a legendary 2 star
---
This is false. We have played for 12-18 hours since launch of F1st. No issues so far. 7 people playing as subscribers and not one issue. 
---
Stop making crap up. Bethesda screwed up with this deal, you don't have to try and make it worse.
---
Okay butthurt.
---
Even if we could boycott the game or change this companies business model, what does it solve? Yeah, it's a video game, it's a pointless endeavor. To me anyway, a small pastime I like to engage in, but I'm not gonna expect a company or organization to change for me, obviously since NO ONE is doing anything about it, must mean maybe we are dumb enough to buy into something like this, so I'll take my piece of pie thank you :) if it means I get unlimited storage space and not be grieved by dudes who take this game entirely too seriously 
---
Btw it's my money so I'll do as I please, if I dont like it, I'll stop playing
---
Thanks so far I love it. It’s a great new world out there in West Virginia to tame and meet wastelanders
---
Whaaaaat?
---
I like the patriot prime version better, but I got it mainly for the voice.
---
Good lol if anyone is stupid enough to spend 100$ a year on this deserves it
---
Nooo. The community
---
Almost the same as you get free atoms (crowns) a scrap box (unlimited mat bag) a new free to place "survival tent" that gives you quick access to a cooking station, scrap box, and stash box. Also came with free icons, some dance emotes, and the ranger NCR outfit.oh and I completely forgot about your own private server for you and your friends (if you want it completely private you can temporarily block your friends and they wont be able to join your server)
---
I agree it should have weight.  But there is no reason we shouldn't be allowed to build chests/storage to hold it.  Even if it is seperate storage only available in our base.  Limit the stash that is at all stores, but don't limit the space at our base.  If we want to hold a skyscraper worth of steel, we should be able to build a skyscraper to hold it.  Fallout is all about scavaging and feeling stronger the more you play.
---
For me it was the opposite.
---
That requires logging into the game.  Just can't bring myself to do it.
---
I probably should have assumed you don't grasp the concept of Google either, here you go ya lazy bum.  
---
https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-microtransactions-hines/
---
You brought up P2W out of nowhere, it wasn't mentioned once until you brought it up by saying it.
---
Exactly!!!!
---
havent really noticed them before either until today, a bunch of frozen unkillable ones in WestTek. This happend in WS too. Same seever. Another server I jumped in on had no frozen enemies.
---
Speaking of WestTek, I used to be able to sneak through the entire place killing the muties. Now they are fighting robots in the first room, and when the robots are dead I aggro the whole place and I have to defend against waves of super mutants. They must have gotten hold of some mentats and psycho because they seem smarter now ;-)
---
How long have you given it? Sometimes it will take a solid 2 minutes but it will always unfreeze for me. I'm on Xbox and it happens at least once a day.
---
This is the worst thing about Fallout 1st.  The stash problem they made such a big deal about was just a lie to make money.
---
EAT THE RICH!
---
Just make sure you have the cannibal card and a little salt. I hear they can be gamey...
---
I'm playing on the private server with my gf who I live; i was just testing it alone. But we're playing outer worlds now.. not together ofc, just in the same room
---
I haven’t got the chance to play it yet, more so I don’t want to play it because when eso first came out I hated it but they fixed a lot of things after a year or so of it coming out, would you say it’s worth playing? I haven’t talked to anyone yet who has played it. And is there going to be a bunch of dlcs coming out for fo76 like eso?
---
Thanks all.  Problem solved.  Wad using the wrong doors. Which,  raised new FO76 build issues, but I got there. I wish the keypad doors came in metal.  Oh well, bigger fish to fry.
---
What's worse is if you're on a public server at an event and they're one-shotting everything then using the dances as taunts. They could be off obliterating the event on their own server but instead are actively choosing to make other people's games worse.
---
said it before its only 0.43 cents a day,and everyone is moaning?ive seen badder deals this day..
---
Someone with a Brain.
---
I spent the 12.99 to try it, the servers mainly. So I can actually play with my friends and not have to deal with rude players. 
---
Spend your money how you want. I believe it's worth it. But that's my opinion.
---
There's absolutely nothing they can say that woukd make the situation better and many things to make it worse. It's better they say nothing, which is probably what they've been directed to do by Zenimax.
---
I'm guessing you either didn't read this thread or blatantly ignored:

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d2ikst/cosmetic\_only\_was\_never\_stated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d2ikst/cosmetic_only_was_never_stated/) 
---
It even says in the article you posted: " Bethesda will be using the revenue generated through the sale of cosmetic Fallout 76 microtransactions to fund the development of DLC for the game. As a result, all of Fallout 76’s DLC [will be free](https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76s-dlc-will-be-free-bethesda-will-fund-it-with-cosmetic-micro-transactions/)"
---
I highly suggest if you play very hard, just go one step further to survival.  It is really a different experience.  They do more damage, have more life, but you also do more damage.  Very hard just feels a little bullet spongy.
---
Wassamatta? They got you pushing too many pencils?
---
You got to really know what your doing to try and kill players with melee in NW. Its good to have a melee weapon with you for wildlife so you don't make noise.
---
That was well-put and I am right with ya.
---
Amazing
---
And who can we call, to put a salve on your own whiny ass?
---
Its not that strange considering this game is just fo4 modded and the broken state that it is
---
Someone in the comments talking about teddies punching them. I can't get past the fact that it's worded, projected, like the person was actually being physically assaulted.  Fucking, grow a spine.
---
The ones you can convince to drop money on this game anyway.
---
How convenient for you to skip over this part: "Bethesda has been very clear since that initial announcement that there will be no pay-to-win elements".  I'm done with you, clearly can't realize when you've lost.
---
Seriously, I don't think FO4 is worth the incessant hate but it shouldn't exactly be the landmark standard for Fallout games (neither should 3, though, it clearly should be... *Brotherhood of Steel* ;\^))
---
I haven't seen any of this yet but that isn't a bad idea OP. With enough power armor and launch codes we can ruin fallout 1st for Todd's gimps
---
It's still an OR if its not an XOR :^ )
---
theres no subscription fee for the base game is there? once bought if you keep playing you arent paying bethesda, you're costing them an (incredibly) small amount of money to have the servers support you
---
On public server tonight, I've seen quite a few legendaries, killed a 3*SB in the Ash Heap and it dropped a 1* Supressor's Lead Pipe. Who-hoo.
---
shit meme is shit
---
It's a shame 4's modding scene is largely dead apart from the very long-term projects like F4NV, although I do understand why, because the engine has a lot of potential compared to 3 and NV's for a lot of things (weapons are the greatest example, the modding system is farrrrrrr better than NV).
---
No, they're probably using alt accounts. Make it sound like there's more people than there actually are that support first. Could be conspiracy theories, but that's what everyone said 76 breaking it's promise was until it happened.
---
*laughs in 600kb/s* 
---
Happened to me a while back, game corrupted and had to be redownloaded.
---
You say there are pay to win elements. How is anything so far pay to win? part of the point of pay to win is to have an actual competitive advantage over other people. it was even said in a set of patch notes in april:
---
"When we originally announced the Atomic Shop last year, we said that it will not provide anything that offers a competitive advantage. We remain committed to that statement and take it into account when we evaluate every new item that we bring to the Shop, both now and in the future. While Repair Kits do offer a way to fix an item in the field, we feel you will find that they are a convenient option you can utilize during your adventures. If we find that Repair Kits do offer any sort of competitive advantage once they are available, we will make any changes necessary to ensure that advantage is removed." 
---
You seem to only have the ability to pick and choose what you use as your information in order to control the context of it, when all that does is attempt to force your beliefs onto others. You're set in your head about what you think and nothing i say and no proof i could possibly provide you is going to change that so I don't see a reason to reply to any more of your comments here.
---
Nothing wrong with dogfood, it never spoils, and it makes you feel like a good boy.
---
No you can refund your purchase and get your money back and keep cosmetics and atoms. Don't even think about letting them run off with your money
---
&gt; Its like saying, you grow your own tobacco so you support big tobacco
---
Growing your own is the opposite of supporting big tobacco. Playing the game and no other means that the player is supporting the game at this moment. How are you being used by someone's criticism of these recent moves?
---
Every now and then my character sounds like Nate when they run. Reminds me of how polished Fallout 4 is everytime it happens

People are not mostly complaining about the price, but about the exclusivity of the utility items that are included in it which could be released for free to everyone instead.

I deal with the hunger and thirst with melons. 10%water and 18% food. I just refill Everytime I'm at my camp.
---
Would you really think people do that? Going on the internet and telling lies?
---
I've gotten three: one right after the patch (cleanup), and then two in one night a few days later (cleanup, stings)
---
&gt;That's actually a really cool tool. Thanks!
---
Is also totally innacurate.
---
We should just start another war. Adventure enthusiasts vs the survival parties. Multiple groups just duking it out against one another.
---
I know, and I've got good doggy perk so it's super useful, but I'd love to experiment with other foods you can make that provide additional benefits. The crafting of food is just too slow and makes it a grind rather than a feature.
---
Or i havent yet learned how to do that socially acceptable way on reddit yet.... but you know what is really easy for you to do? Check it.
---
Who the fuck is stupid enough to buy that, or even play this game?
---
That's the most pathetic manchild shit ever.
---
It seemed like more of an accident than a free unlock. It looks like they're preparing to release a liberator-themed pack in the store and that they're getting the emote ready to sell
---
Fucking hilarious haha

This community is awesome. Keep it up guys.

 Whats a trader?

it's the most accurate source, as companies don't like to release potentially embarrassing data. but official numbers have never been good from bethesda. height of 76 they reported 400k active daily users. and total sales are at 2.6. given the most recent report (about 3 months ago) declined to 200k users per month. i'd say under 40k at any moment for today is pretty accurate.
---
True on Bethesda helping to expand Fallout to a wider audience.
---
Bruh.. let it rest.  The facts are there, I'm not gonna argue with you as you skew them in your head.
---
&gt;50 caps was a lot to me, I’m only level 41
---
Are you not selling things, or are you eating money buying things from robot vendors? How the fuck can you be level 41 and have less than 100 caps?
---
You could take a character fresh from the vault and hit the daily max in a couple hours, so I'm truly baffled.
---
It's 180 AUD which is 123 USD and that doesn't make sense because GST is 10%
---
thank you for your comment. I guess I just have terrible luck.
---
that is probably happening all the time, regardless of whether there is a controversy or not. i've long suspected the same thing happens on the destiny sub
---
We did that, it didn't work. It did repopped the mobs indeed, but no legs.
---
I'm hoping there will be a bunch of stuff for the holidays.
---
I know it's just a trigger event, but it is creepy as shit.
---
Yes, so far I've seen this issue only on PVs.
---
"consume product"
---
lmao
---
How could you be wrong about it sucking if you never played it until today? Something smells kinda funny.
---
Publics seem unafected so far.  
---
At least not since they've fixed it the last time.
---
&gt; It was also stated that the servers would house approximately 12 players per instance
---
I'm not sure where you got this info from, because as far back as the [NoClip documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi8PTAJ2Hjs) (which came out in June 2018) they stated that servers were planned to be between 24 and 32 players.
---
The game is definitely having some growing pains, but I have been playing pretty consistently for nearly the past year straight and still haven't really moved on to another game.  So with that being said it's been a good value and have had as much longevity  as any other game I've played if not more.  I don't really see me buying the f1st or whatever its called because I can just buy another  game with that money, but if someone is enjoying the benefits of it that's fine let em...
---
Exactly. This. Although Fallout 4 was kinda testing site from some game/engine features for future project, it is still playable and enjoyable... except role-playing part, of course. Nonetheless, Fallout 76 can be good, if Bethesda do things right. Wastelanders (and all future updates) will add more and more content. Let us hope it will not be "pay-to-lose-your-scrap" content.
---
But now they're solely using alts.
---
fuckthis game and fuck todd howard. i want to punch that lil bitch in the face
---
Yes it's gotten alot better, I mean there are still bugs ofc and some stuff that needs to be fixed, but it's a million times better than when it launched that's for sure. Its definitely alot better to find a group or community to play with tbh, there's one raid out now (think of it like dungeons) that requires a team of 4 that all know what they are doing in order to complete it, but there's no match matching for it yet. There has been limited timed events kinda like the seasonal events in eso, but as far as dlcs the only thing announced so far is wastelanders and that wont be out until first quarter of next year unfortunately, after they haven't announced anything. I definitely think it's worth playing if you like the gameplay style. Also it seems like keep fixing more and more stuff every patch, and haven't added loot crates in yet so that's also great lol
---
If people stopped buying these sorts of things, the companies would stop investing resources in creating them.  Maybe they would focus on other things that actually benefit the consumer.
---
They look at things like time played across all accounts. You're not really hurting them even a little bit because they're gonna have those servers up regardless. If you wanted to hurt them, you would uninstall because if a large enough amount of players quit playing altogether it would affect the numbers presented to the bean counters back at Zenimax. But I doubt players who actually enjoy the game want to "hurt" the game enough to have it shut down. If you want to effect change, write out a feedback report on their website, they actually review those
---
Already triggering the fanboys I see. Don't  take jokes as hard as you take dicks, helps ease butthurt :P
---
&gt;A few days ago there was a post here of a dude showing a picture of his fo76 character screen which was the Fo4 load game screen. Lol
---
Got a link?
---
I had hoped that 76 would end up being another No Man's Sky. Bad Launch but then given a lot of free massive updates...
---
I had this happen to me in NW on Thursday. Couldn't open my pip-boy, couldn't close my reticle to target, my reticle was 4 animated arrows.
---
I agree, Survival is where it's at. The thing is though that ALL 3 playthroughs I did in Fallout 4 were on Survival. I also did a "Rambo" playthrough that was very intense and almost sadomasochistic.
---
This time I want to play more casually and see what a good stealth commando build is like in Fallout 4.
---
It's terrible unless you're stealthy or you can catch people by surprise, but I've also had a lot of fun playing about with the build too - I use clubber, incisor, martial artist, run for your knife, action girl/boy, marathoner, and one more card to keep me alive (I've had some luck with chem fiend, suppressor, and ironclad). Whenever I want to win matches I switch to a shotgun or a machinegun build
---
Some people give up on 76 and move on
---
But not us...
---
*Not us...*
---
Actually thank you! I’m glad I had someone’s opinion on this, I kinda figured it would have a bad release so I wanted to give it time. But I’m actually going buy the game and give it a try! I love eso so it would be cool to get into something else kinda similar but different
---
This glitch has actually happen before in Vault 94. It was on a [livestream](https://youtu.be/Ah_sV0_OLQ8) of the opening of the vault raids with a couple of youtubers where on 57:33, UpIsNotJump is describing the same glitch in which you had encounter.
---
You made a new profile, just to post this?
---
I'll bet your momma, is *real* proud.
---
Go up the basement stairs, and ask her.
---
lol sounds a little like what people thought about F76. It's not a traditional fallout, and is a Survival game like NMS or Dayz almost, though definitely lighter. As soon as people heard *No human NPCs* they should have realized. I played wow, I was comfortable enough in ESO. It's just not even the writing is anything like ES games, most characters talk like they're in the modern day and nothing like Skyrim even though that's in the future lol
---
Fuck Fallout 1st
---
And as always, a non-fo76 quote is highly upvoted. Love it.
---
Yeah, that sounds about what I expect from this community. Attack other member's of the community because they don't share the same outlook as you. Is Fallout 1st a bad move, sure is, but being a scumbag to other people over it just makes you a child throwing a temper tantrum. Move on with your life, play other games. Dont be a dick.
---
&gt;entitled players
---
There's that word again: Entitled
---
You know, entitled isn't a negative term by default, right? I would consider those who bought this at the full, AAA price *entitled* to the truth, at the very least. 
---
Decent scrap storage should not be part of a VIP service. Call me crazy. It was a complaint because it was/is an inconvenience to the base game. It would have been, most certainly, a QoL change. It is the very definition. 
---
Instead, it's something extra you gotta buy, when people were told from the start shit like this was not gonna happen. Lord forbid people hold them to their word and suggest fixes and QoL improvements. People should have known that, on top of a full priced game with microtransactions, they were gonna end up having to pay even more to get the luxurious service of decent scrap storage. Entitled indeed. 
---
They created the problem to sell the fix. They told a lie, and sold the truth. It really is that simple.
---
I think you mean *traitor* (e.g. Pete Hines / Todd Howard).
---
I support it.
---
&gt;Really the absolute biggest advantage over a public server is the workshops. You can take them all and do none stop event farming along with the goodies.
---
Unless you have a full team of people it's basically impossible to take all the workshops. I tried it the first night, and by the time you Dinah the defense event on the 5th or 6th shop the second round of defense starts popping up on workshop 1 and 2.
---
You can hop back and defend, or let it get overrun and they destroy everything so your producing stops to zero. Either way, once you get to 8 or so it's a nonstop stream of defense events that don't give you enough time to claim new shops.
---
It sucks. If someone just keeps spamming the emote, the music keeps stacking until it's just an electronic buzzing sound.
---
Because you're rabble rabble "paying to win"" rabble rabble, rabble rabble.
---
You can build a fortress, and an army of protectrons with that mountain of unlimited scrap!
---
Yep, gone for me too :-/
---
if i were bethesda I would abandon this sub
---
Still using kindergarten insults? Come back when you have something more brutal, perhaps a dead dad joke? Or idk something more creative?
---
People just like slapping the highest number value possible to get clicks.
---
When the notice came up for me it said 20 minutes.
---
Thank you

Me? I wouldnt pay shit.. hoarders/collectors will pay a lot for the rare ones
---
*yawn*
---
Wot colour is considered rare?
---
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
---
Red
---
I dont know.. I dont really follow that
---
i know there is a list on here somewhere.. Ill link it if I can find it
---
Hats are worthless. The outfits range. Red can go from 25k to 100k yellow and forest can easy go up to 20 to 35k
---
Pink tops out at about 15 to 20
---
Blue is about 5 to 7
---
Brown and green around 1k maybe
---
Where is there a Halloween cat plushie? You just talking about the Mr. Fuzzy thing?
---
2K hours. Well at least you've gotten your moneys worth.
---
Now can we please stop with the I'm quitting over FO1st posts. It's the RK's all over again.
---
A lot of players have already bought subs. They're not changing it.
---
If you want to quit do it because of server stability or the fact we can't get into West Tek 50% of the time. Dropping frame rates melee attacks won't register the first hit V94 running like shit and there's a lot more. Those issues need attention.
---
Space Fallout has been such an exhilarating experience. I can’t wait to get some mods to add the proper music.

It just works

ufff. You owe me for a lot of scrolling :P
---
Very informative, thanks
---
Good thing no one listens to you pal
---
Yeah that seems to be for the best
---
Of course it was going to happen, we don’t take kindly to those who don’t take kindly
---
True. Fallout and the community are so special for us that we are willing to keep up with the bugs and insults. A soul for a soul
---
Not shady companies, but smaller companies that technically don't operate in Europe yet
---
A bad day in Appalachia is still more civil than a good day in a GTAO lobby.
---
So you got your money back?
---
Imagine not being upset about Bethesda lying to our faces about not being able to implement unlimited item storage and then turning around and selling it for $100-144 a year plus other lies
---
Only thing I'll suggest is if alt+f4 doesn't work do the three finger salute ctrl+alt+del to bring up a screen that will allow you to open task manager. Once task manager is open just find the process (in this case fallout76.exe) and right click on it and go end task. This will work for any non responsive program and easier on your windows install.
---
Aww I'm on Xbox. Raids aren't bad, there's some charisma perks I would recommend the whole party to have to make it easier. Also, not sure what build you guys were running but any full bloodied build is very challenging in raids. 50% max hp min. Would be my recommendation. I run raids with my shotgun build, and cripple everything to make it a smooth run. Enforcer = crowd control. I've done it with my bloodied commando build @ 50% hp, dropped my damage output a bit but increase my survivability significantly.
---
 No. I want to know what "I was a trader from almost day one" means.
---
Exactly my point, thanks.
---
Like with this person you’re replying to, I’m having a hard time with people who are still led down this path of “Oh this game will improve, I’m not worried about it”.
---
Improve? Every improvement has been either removed or stuck behind a paywall. BGS has really only still focused on critical bugs and left QOL updates for their membership. Can’t wait for the posts two years from now that read something along the lines of “I took out a second mortgage on my house to afford all the GREAT cosmetic and membership perks of FO76 since they upped the price a little. Oh no, don’t worry about the bugs.. they’re still improving it!!!”
---
The reason to quit this game alone involves having to balance your stash box for 30 mins prior to checking out every new location. That gets old real fast.
---

Maybe this was the plan all along to better simulate an apocalypse scenario with the struggles that society would still have when trying to rebuild itself such as class wars between the haves and the have-nots. /s
---
It started happening to me when I got the backpack.
---
This sounds exactly the same reasoning behind the captain marvel hate bandwagon. You on that too?
---
Solid AVGN meme
---
Everyone has a different perspective of whether it would be worth it or not.
---
They legitimately have the right to make their own decisions.
---
It makes me think a lot about Don't Starve, spoopy yet whismical.
---
What do you mean?
---
We've always fought each other over loot and caps, it's not like we had towns or market squares of people in a server.
---
There is always going to be conflict
---
Pretty cool fantasy though
---
Lol they should
---
I love this game, but lets be honest, FO76 is a dumpster fire of a game since the beginning, and it took 1 whole year for us, as a community, to get really mad at Bethesda. Do you really think that we are the 'toxic' (the most overused word of 2019) side of this relation? 
---
I'm talking about us, the ones who plays this game, not about shitty youtubers, ign, eurogamer and all this bullshit.
---
Fallout 4 has longer load times than 76. Zoning out from locations in Boston area took minutes .. in a solo game. I can't go back to that 😎
---
Deserved, they are sheeps that support rotten leeches ruining the game for everyone with half a brain.
---
So what you’re saying is that the community has acted like asses towards each other since the beginning as well. Fair point carry on on all accounts
---
You should find another game to play. Thanks for leaving us in peace!
---
Can't tell if that's sarcasm or not tbh but thanks lol
---
Or this just isn't a good post.
---
Love it! Hope they carve it on his headstone
---
They could seriously do with 20 more songs.
---
No sarcasm lol. I love the AVGN. I've seen every episode twice.
---
You talk too much.
---
Watch the music video on YouTube

Initially the price for 1 month is justified. I did lose my scrap the day before they said they'd fix it which really sucks honestly but it was my fault for accidentally using another players scrap stash. I didn't put anything in it just opened it up an backed out of it. Anyways the price is justified because they had other bundles for 9.99 that came with a outfit and 1500 atoms. This is 12.99 and 1650 atoms and basically unlimited scrap. If you have alot like I did on multiple characters then I would definitely get the 1 month to condense it all. If you don't have a mountain of scrap then the only reason is the 1650 atoms an ranger outfit. I don't think the yearly price is a good deal. I'd be more akin to buy a monthly subscription once in a while if they got something good bundled in that month rather that fork over 100 for a possibility of something good for 12 months. The mini camp is nice but not really needed. Private servers is ones own preference of what they wanna do in it. I don't dislike the idea but also have no real personal use for it. It's just there to me if I ever should want to use it.
---
I thought that this was well established already. Like water being wet.
---
The Witcher 3 was game of the year in 2015, not Fallout 4.
---
In case of you don't know, i have 5 pieces of weapon reduce.
---
I always keep a portion of junk for stabilize repair weapon on the way.
---
Wandering all around applachian so basically weapon station are everywhere.
---
I'm betting whatever system their using uses virtual servers, as all modern systems do, and they can spin up or shut down servers whenever they need to. If the survival mode is not under heavy load then there wouldn't be many servers didicated to it anyway. They probably wanted players grouped into fewer game modes so they can create more populated servers and make the game feel like it's not dying.
---
All the junk in the box will stay there, and you can use it. You also keep all emotes, the armour etc.
---
You just won't be able to add more junk to the box. :)
---
Getbtwo copies of The Outer Worlds instead, one for yourself and one for a frenemy.
---
Your junk will still be there, just can't add to it
---
Hes referring to when they put in an update that allows players to set up trading posts at their C.A.M.P. to sell their earned loot.
---
If they weren't butthurt they wouldn't insult they'd move on, yet they got upset over a meme, a joke.
---
Now I could ignore it myself I admit but if someone flings mud I fling back :p
---
Bought it for one month. Fallout 76 is all I play at the moment besides dabbling in some Oblivion but so far I really really like the private world. It’s relaxing to know you won’t be bothered in anything you do. The private world combined with the stash box is a huge advantage. Yes it’s pay to win and yes it’s fun as heck. I do stand with the majority of the community in saying the subscription is ridiculous so I won’t be paying for it for a year, but I may every once in a while drop 13.90 just to rent it for a month
---
Okay. Still new to the game. Might have been my alt? I'm just relating my experience. You could call bullshit if I was glorifying myself or a friend I guess but the point was the assistance, not my ineptitude lol
---
You'll forgive the confusion based on the reception I've gotten to a joke lol. But yea James is great
---
Oh people were traders on 3rd party sites long before then, legitimately the only thing that saved this game
---
They found a way to implement the VAT system finally it seems.
---
Bought a month, not sure if I’ll renew or not. 
---
My experience so far: I’ve enjoyed private sessions so far. I hate PVP elements, so I’ve never messed with workshops before. It finally gives me a chance to use those. It also makes it way easier to immerse yourself in the RP element and the worldbuilding, imo. 
---
I also didn’t realize how much more I’d enjoy looting in a private session - way more stuff, way less time spent thinking about it. Enemy leveling is way less frustrating. I like the scrap box. I haven’t touched the tent yet.
---
The price works for me. I like spending atoms on cosmetics, so that’s a big plus for me, but it might not be for everyone. I’m used to paying for ESO and this feels like it’s along the same lines as it...less content, more privacy. 
---
So far, so good. Not game-changing for me, but I haven’t run into any real downsides yet.
---
i have compained about this many times, whenever they put something out for The Elder Scrolls: Legends.
---
Its usually 20 $ and 20 € each time so europeans have to pay 20% more.
---
&gt;financial retardation
---
There it is!
---
I could tell you were someone whose opinion wasn’t worth considering before but this just confirms it.
---
Not worth the energy arguing with you I’m afraid
---
I believe I stated that already. Just to see how it is. Didnt buy a yearly pass. 30 days for $18 isn't much of a reward imo.
---
And if you do, hopefully they'll pay it forward like I plan to. Good on ya!
---
My endgame consists of creating the perfect base for me, farming the exact legendaries I want, loot everything everywhere, and mindlessly wandering the wasteland
---
Nothing. Because you will skip one trip to Taco Bell and buy another month.
---
My "gift" emote seems to have disappeared into the either.
---
Still, there is no 90 percent poll that was taken. I don't deny there are trolls out there, but you can't throw a random statistic out there unless you got proof to back it up.
---
Unless they fixed the shotgun bug, i wouldnt bother
---
Yeah it gets f'ed in the a and yet they continue to support the game.
---
The fallout 1st emojis are absolute taunt emojis
---
I think that's more of a trait we all spawn in with lol
---
I just take complaining as people caring and having some passion for what's important to them.
---
I know I dont complain about things that are not important to me.  I'm sure most people are the same.
---
So yeah gamers complain....but so does everyone else no matter what they choose to do.  It's a thing that happens.
---
From my understanding explosive shotguns can still be viable but the two-shot ones are next to useless.
---
I might be wrong tho
---
[](/ajshrug)Yeah, TSE shotties got nerfed to oblivion a while back.

They must not know who the nerd is. Their loss. AVGN, board james, and james and mike mondays is some of the best stuff on youtube.
---
Never trust people in teddy bear costumes, they're terrible in any other game too
---
Here’s my solution. Buy fallout 1st if you want. Don the ranger armor and have your quad automatic Tesla ready for the protesters
---
Facts don't care about your feelings, alright gang?
---
They are not unused servers. If someone leaves their server that used server is assigned to another player.
---
I mean, when those choices are shitting on everyone else’s fun, I agree they should be doing something else.
---
Lmao. I don’t think they should abandon the game at all but I at least respect your self-awareness
---
They wont stick with it unless the subs bring in enough revenue to keep supporting the servers and staff. 
---
That's all there really is to it.
---
Oh no, I used a word that has a legitimate meaning in the dictionary, and I used it in a way that suited said definition!
---
Well that’s just it then. Need something to cling on to when you can’t argue the facts. You know, you’re the third person to actually do that? Some guy earlier got offended that I used the word “fuck.” It’s a pretty common tactic for someone to use when they’re on the losing side of an argument; pearl clutch and get offended.
---
But I’m sure you have so many things going on and so little time to expel on someone who uses *gasps* profanity. Even if you had to waste a comment telling me so, lmao. Run along kiddo.
---
If only, my m2.SSD is so much faster in 4 then waiting on the servers online.

Well one good thing that came out of this dumpster fire of a game is a good advertisement campaign for The Outer Worlds.

I guess lol, already noticed at least 1 person down voted you just for liking a meme.

There is no reason to hate anyone in this game. Besides, bunch of old Fallout 2/NV fanatics wont play Fallout 76, soooo... it's pretty neat to have a sensible players around.

good to know then.
---
another misconception that the ragers dont wanna see :-p
---
/r/evenwithcontext
---
Gee what an original opinion. Can’t believe nobody has said this before.
---
Also just FYI the scrapbox glitch was very uncommon and is already fixed so you don’t have to worry about that.
---
The scrapbox/stash limit argument is also flawed. Scrap items are a single item with a set value that doesn’t change so having unlimited scrap doesn’t affect the stability of the game. However, with weapons, armour, and aid items that have individual mod slots and conditions there are essentially unlimited variations and each would need to be processed as an individual item - that’s why 100 of the same unmodded, 100% condition hunting rifles wouldn’t stack in your inventory and instead show up as individual items.
---
Idk why I’m wasting my time explaining this
---
You can use the box in adventure mode too.
---
Hey dumbass did you know there’s an atomic shop and that we can support them there instead of them ripping us off? Get your head out of the sand. Get out of this sub-reddit and look at what everyone else is saying. Your denial is sad.
---
"Your camp is too large to be placed on this world. Switch to a private server? Yes/No." Yes would log you in to a private world, where you could either make your camp public-ready or just play there. No would behave the same as when your camp spot is taken, and load you into the server with no camp.
---
You don’t. Theres currently no way to get them. Only a small minority of the shown mounted creatures can actually be unlocked.
---
12 something or another a month is the new rich!
---
guns dont work so well for me. they mostly dont seem to do damage im lower level but still.. i just scrapped all mine and gone melee. thankfully i have a few points in strength lol
---
still loving private servers as solo tho
---
The funny thing is, is I only want private servers and mods, the mmo was the bastard from the start.
---
Before I log off I travel back to base so if someone's there I'll wait, and so if I need to make stuff when I log back in, I'm there already.
---
Just an FYI since it's been brought up a few tims in the past few threads I've read. Passive mode only makes it so YOU will not do damage to another player or their stuff. So others are still free to attack you.
---
The "Survival Tent" can be placed anywhere a camp can be put, costs 0 caps, and comes with everything shown. Scrap boxes can be opened by anyone, but only those who are 1st members can deposit scrap into it for storage, its like a Second Stash
---
Ya know.  You didn’t have to hide haha
---
That’s a big L ,I have a lot of em I just want the yua gui bc I’ve seen it
---
The reason i quit Fo76 10 months ago is the limited endgame. I hated that we had such a huge map to explore yet only a querter of the map had mobs that scale to max level so i got tired of exploring only the bottom right part of the map. I wish all mobs scaled to max level. Once you reach max level you have no reason to farm 75% of the map. Such a waste.
---
I've spoiled myself.  In previous fallout games and elder scrolls I have always used a weight mod so that I don't have to manage my weight.  For me weight management was not fun and was too much of a chore.
---
I don’t give a shit about using the word fuck.
---
Using slurs on the other hand... I’m not personally offended because it just shows to me that you have no awareness of other people around you and have a severe lack of empathy to double down on using a word that is *by definition* offensive to people with disabilities; let alone when you consider the horrible history of the treatment of disabled people.
---
It’s like you have no idea what context is.
---
And people like you always chime in with the “oh you’re gonna dismiss what I’m saying because I hurt ur feelings with some dumb word and ignore all the HARD FACTS I provided” while you jerk yourself off thinking about how you owned another libtard with your *logic* on the internet.

Minimum requirements to run the server is three logical cores and 6GB RAM.
---
&gt; I expect a 24/7 persistent server
---
I completely understand wanting your server to be persistent, but that's not related to system requirements at all. Based on the stash being broken it's a safe bet that the persistence issue is yet another bug.
---
Damn. For a second I thought they added moumted creatures. That one could ride, like horses. Not like whatever you were thinking about, weirdo.
---
Do [this quest](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Unsolved:_Tracking_Terror) and you should receive it:)
---
Haha
---
This has happened to me twice in the Vault raids immediately after I revived a fellow teammate. After which I could not go into my pip boy, stim teammates or open doors. It made a difficult time even worse to say the least, can’t believe more ppl aren’t talking about this
---
This is not true, you can get the quest multiple times a day, once per each Technical Data you pick up.
---
Cannot believe I was down voted for this topic!!
---
Thanks for the feed back! Also good to get a view from the people who are using it. I might try it for a month, I thought the price was steep if you don’t use atoms. Also I’m a PC and Xbox fallout 76 player. So would be good if you could use it on both platforms.They should’ve had a version without atoms that is a few $ cheaper. $15 a month it but much I think ongoing
---
I like that. Im going to start doing that. I normally just look on the map but i like this better
---
Someone likely said this already but get a different gun.
---
~~&gt; The thing is, the game was rigged from the start.~~
---
Could the game **BE** any more rigged?
---
The problem is that most people want conformity.  If you dont think the way they do, then you are enemy. In psychology we call it tribe mentality. The internet intensifies that sevenfold. "If I think its a bad game then you should too, and if you don't, you're an idiot."
---
Thank you for the info.
---
Forget people. Fallout 76 the video game is grief incarnate.
---
I love it when players attack me. I laugh at them. Wasting ammo and game time doing no damage. LOL
---
I mean literally like 80days ago you were talking about power armour cells or some shit
---
I think it is still a technical limitation otherwise they would have made a general unlimited stash.  Since weapons and armor and clothing and such are stored by piece and scrap is not it's easier for the servers to handle.  It doesn't matter if there is 10k steel, it's still technically 1 item as far as the server is concerned where if I had 10 white asylum hats it stores them each as a separate item.
---
Honestly my style is I like to carry a lot of different weapons with me; I enjoy swapping guns and melee choices often. And I can't stop hoarding outfits and armor in my stash. That obviously leaves not much space for junk and scrap in either my inventory or stash, so I end up having to juggle stuff constantly, and frequently ending up with nowhere to put things (inventory is full, everything I wanted to scrap is scrapped, and stash is full). I could just get rid of a bunch of stuff, but that would make the game a lot less fun for me, and it's one of the reasons I don't play much, probably the biggest reason.
---
If you're on pc I can give you screws if you still need them.
---
For $100 a year I won’t post about it. dm for details
---
If you guys wanna see some Fallout 1st defenders check out my latest post on this sub. They exist in the bowels of this sub and it’s sad. So much sweet salty denial.
---
You could always consider befriending some antisocial or "less social" gamers. It doesn't really help to jump to the server that a friend is on if they're a person who typically likes to play with a group of people, cuz they'll often end up being on the more crowded servers. But if they play alone most or all of the time and you jump to their server, it can end up being a server that has less people on it in general.
---
I think this is a great idea. I’m gonna pay 13$ just for the icon and dances with the added benefit of people coming after me... Great news!!!!
---
You also lose your tent
---
Meanwhile I’m not able to return any new tech data since weeks. Quest never pops up, whatever I do (place in world container, find new one, sell/rebuy at vendor, split the stacks). So I will never get any BoS paint ;-)
---
Fallout 4 is the framework for 76, but unfortunately the jump to multiplayer has required them to streamline many things that people may not even notice.
---
In general, I would argue the AI for NPCs has been simplified.  I believe Scorched do not follow traditional humanoid combat subroutines except *maybe* taking cover, but humanoids in Fallout 4 were capable of doing things like taking cover, flanking, and flushing you out with grenades.  They could also blindfire from cover too.
---
Certain NPCs in 4 are also capable of performing evasive maneuvers in response to you shooting at them.  Deathclaws and feral ghouls are the ones that did this I recall, and it greatly contributed to their combat threat at one point, especially ghouls since they would duck and weave crazy fast.  I believe Mister Gutsy, and Assaultrons were also capable of performing shuffles to the side to evade your gunfire too.
---
Exclusive to Deathclaws, Deathclaws could grab you and slam you into the ground, both in, and outside of power armor, and several NPCs that utilized melee attacks (the player could also do these) were capable of performing finisher animations on low-life targets to kill them.
---
All of this stuff was pretty much removed from 76, maybe because it was too hard to implement in a multiplayer environment, or perhaps they just didn't find the time to include them smoothly.
---
And there's still lesser stuff in 76 for combat people aren't likely to notice either, like that gore was toned down considerably.  Melee weapons don't gib, or dismember enemies at all, and only if you're using BLoody Mess is it possible to do full-body gibbing on NPCs, but that's not the same as normal limb removal on death like Fallout 4 had.
---
Live dismemberment used to be a feature for specific enemies such as Feral Ghouls, and even Mirelurks and Bloodbugs as well if I'm not mistaken.  Evidently dismemberment IS something that is still completely possible, since most robots are still capable of losing their limbs, so I find removing it from Ghouls and other creatures to be inexcusable.  Fuck, even in pre-release videos, a player was incapacitated after being shot with a black powder pistol that gibbed their arm off.

When i see that style of camp, i get real weary.
---
Oh right the tent, I keep forgetting about the tent
---
That’s kind my procedure as well. Also if I’m bored and see someone at my base I generally fast travel just to say hi. I like meeting people in this game. :)
---
Explain world of warcraft then? Same principles, game is full of elitist assholes.
---
I'll admit, I was a little surprised to read this at the very end of the conversation and got "but why male models" flashbacks.  My entire whiskey comparison and the points (the reasonable, coherent ones at least--not the crazies) throughout this thread all revolve around consumer behavior rather than in-game behavior.
---
FO76 came out at a time that game companies as a whole are pushing the monetization envelope further and further, stripping features out of games and selling them back or structuring the game to punish people for not spending extra money.  Many people, myself included, suspect Bethesda is testing how much they can get away with here by introducing a subscription service in a microtransaction-laden game non-F2P game.  Plus the sub itself is jam-packed full of business practices people hate.  The list is pretty extensive and I'm sure someone else in this thread has done a full breakdown of issues there.
---
By buying this sub, you're answering Bethesda's question with "yes, you can get away with basically anything."  Again, rampant anti-consumer behavior, feature stripping, and customer exploitation are massive themes of late in gaimng.  It's a common narrative that games overall (especially once-beloved franchises) are getting worse and worse *because* companies are structuring games to wring money out of players, sacrificing game quality in order to cash out.  Again, the entire point of the whiskey comparison is...*that only works because enough players are supporting that business model with their wallets.*  So if you give a company money when they engage in these practices, you're actively endorsing and subsidizing that decision and the industry trend and you're validating that corporate approach.  When marketing asks "was it worth it?" and "did it work?", your purchase is evidence they point to that they should keep pushing even further.
---
That's why people are mad.  Because gaming, obviously a favorite hobby of many people here, is in a bad place right now.  And FO76 sub purchasers are directly contributing to the worsening of gaming, subsidizing the rot eating the industry.  **Whether they're right is debatable, but also irrelevant.**  These people genuinely believe you're destroying their hobby with your purchases and damaging their quality of life, so it's completely reasonable for them to speak up about it (though not all are going about it in a reasonable way).  Because your purchase, in their minds, acts directly against their self interest.  Nothing about that makes someone "a ridiculous child that needs to grow up", it just makes them a normal person doing exactly what normal people do when their interests are threatened.  Some handle it well and some handle it poorly, but that's just people for you.
---
Well it is a fake source. You can refresh the page and the player count jumps up or down 10k. It's just a site trying to generate ad revenue, hence why every post they beg you to whitelist them on your adblocker.
---
People have an easier time remembering bad things than good ones. So, for example, you're less likely to remember each and every SBQ fight where it went smoothly and you received decent loot, but those disconnects and ghoul's gamma guns stick in your memory.
---
And a big frustration is more likely to stick in your mind than a little frustration, too. I probably disconnect most when I'm just on my way to or from a scrap run, but those aren't memorable. Disconnecting from a Queen fight the time I was trying out my brand new legendary gun and doing great damage, though, I'm still salty about that two weeks later.
---
Not sure it's worth that to be honest.
---
&gt; Fallout 4 has longer load times than 76.
---
Fallout 4 has a mod for that but it requires running the game off of an SSD.

Def someone’s survival tent...
---
Haha good for you. I have other ways of making ppl leave.
---
I’m an OG and this is a d**k move from zenimax
---
Yes i got my money back, rightfully so. If you're tight for cash I would say no or out of shear principal not to give Bethesda money (again no but that's just me). If you're going to do it just go to the refund option (idk if there is one for ps4 since I did this on xbox) as soon as you can after making sure that you got what you wanted. It's up to you tho since again this is Bethesda we're talking about, crazed out of their gourd for cash they are...
---
Far as I know you only get the quest for a single one  picked up and while you have the quest and even after that fact the rest in your inventory are useless. But every new one should trigger it but I dont know that's a new glitch for me never heard of it. Worse case scenario get a friend to do it for you if you have ps4 I'll hook you up
---
Who doesn't like a bit of whale hunting?
---
Thats fair. I might be weary now too. Felt odd falling suddenly. Some anger, sadness and disappointment flooded over hahah
---
Whoa whoa whoa! $12 bucks a month is just “rich” to you?  Look at this guy with his obscene wealth.  He probably thinks a banana cost “only” $10
---
Same. The impossible floating bases drive me crazy despite the fact I get their utility. I prefer to build something that looks like it could really love in the landscape.
---
We got ourselves a good guy greg here. Im not a talker so i dont do that. If i see people i wave and if they ask for things il help if i can but i generally am just a peaceful lone wolf with a war drum
---
they didn't beg me to whitelist them. their numbers corralate to known data (such as rdr2/apex data). far from a fake site, and has no bias against 76. Simple math, going off the numbers we know are fact (all of which is 3 months old) it's fairly easy to view this as within a 10% or so margin of error....as certainly, since the last numbers released there hasn't been a ramp UP.
---
No war but class war babey
---
Or probably restart the launcher.
---
I personally just like practicle. My base top floor is vendors and crafting, downstairs is beds, chairs and instruments. No floating, no specials, no shelves. But thats me
---
Lol “your own “not so private” little world you mean. Shit we could all join it if we were on your friends list! Even if didn’t want us too!
---
lol, Yeah same here! TOW could use some third-person view, but otherwise... GET ME A STRONGER HUNTING RIFLE I need to murder some Snek-monsters!
---
I usually will fill the vending machines up too before I log out so I don't forget to when I log back on.
---
The weapon modding system in Outer Worlds already feels more rewarding than Fallout 4 or 76's ever has. It's just so satisfying and I can't pin point exactly why.
---
You think you have it bad
---
Try being form Australia 
---
Its $180 a year and $22 a month
---
Yeah I’ve had about 50% of people talk back at me. I’m on PC so whatever I still feel like that’s a good percentage and if people don’t feel comfortable on the mic I get it! No prob. I’m just saying hi and rendering services if requested. Gotta make that wasteland hospitable somehow.
---
Man, fallout first is gonna have to be put after finding this thief😂
---
If you bought a  new electric car and the company told you that they would pay for electricity for the car, then a year after buying it they changed their mind, and also decided to give updates to people that paid that were actually able to optimize things and increase mpg, but you had to pay monthly to use that, would you just be ok?
---
You bought a product and were lied to about what you were getting. You weren't misled. There isn't any fancy wording where they didn't technically say something. It was specifically said so that you knew when you bought the product you would not have to worry about this aspect.
---
60 may not be a lot of money, but it's still money spent for a product, and the customer that bought the product deserves to at the very least, get what was promised. It's one thing to buy a bad product. Bad is subjective. It's another thing to be told that a product won't have something, and putting it in anyway after being bought.
---
dont bother saw this guy yesterday. he'll downvote all your comments, report them, and respond with inane shit. probably upset people dislike fallout 1st
---
I have five 5 threads X folders in my desktop right now, time for me to find a job at bethesda
---
&gt; It offers very very little for the price
---
Actually,  it offers quite a lot, especially if you regularly buy atoms, as you're basically getting them for half the regular cost. I, personally,  didn't buy atoms regularly but I still find it quite worth it just to have a private world when I want just jam or have an organized event with friends. Oh, yeah, the emotes and armor are pretty cool too.
---
It's a fake site and there's no known data to compare it to. If you go to even the Apex page and refresh it goes up and down like 400k players every time you refresh. I can guarantee they are not losing and gaining 25% of their player base every second.
---
Reading your develo, develop, develop reminds me of this https://youtu.be/Vhh_GeBPOhs man I'm showing my age...
---
i disagree with you. I even tried spamming refresh and only saw numbers jump around the 1-2% range.
---
ZeniMax! Not so much Bethesda, I say that feeling much the same as you. I just would like to point out it goes past Bethesda, they are the face and voice. Owned by ZeniMax. They do make the game and speak for it, but this business model your seeing is ZENI. If you are upset and don't want to support Bethesda, then please don't support any ZeniMax games. P.S Jerry Bruckheimer, Cal Ripken Jr. And Robert S. Trump are all on ZeniMax board of directors. Look it up lol
---
Literally unplayable. The fact that I had to set my maximum framerate below what my machine could actually run it at in order to fix the CTD, causing no perceivable difference in visual quality? Completely unacceptable. They should be ashamed.
---
ooohh... very nice :) thank you!
---
because them bringing down survival servers dont have to be a technical issue.
---
I respect your opinion, I just feel like instead of locking private worlds behind it completely, there should be an option for private worlds hosted locally, that the scrap box should be free for everyone but with atom shop skins, and that the sub should have a bigger focus on atoms and unique subscription cosmetics instead of things like the scrap box. I’m ok with there being a sub based private server as long as there’s also a local option.
---
Same but I got all the vendors and workbenches on the ground floor, bed and fun stuff up in a loft. The whole camp is a barn in the Toxic Valley and it makes sense organically.
---
Why would they? Any response to the community would only flare this whole thing up. They're waiting for the hate/hype to die down before they come out of hiding to assure us that everything is fine/looking into issues/making some changes/bullshit.
---
I'll add you, Golder7, I'm in the UK.
---
Can you at least send me the known data they're pulling these numbers from then?
---
Fuck COD, its gonna be full of 12 year old crybabies for the 1st month or so anyway. Stay in Appalachia!
---
I miss the cycle through your fav guns with the pad.  FO76 is current and last, FO4 cycle through your favs.  I never liked the wheel.
---
Added back :)
---
Except if fallout fuckyou 1st is a success it will ruin other games? This isn't about people having a different outlook as you. This is about gamers defending their hobby and keeping the goalposts from moving any further.
---
that'd be like a dozen articles over the past 6 months. google is your friend on that.
---
With it being a legacy weapon you're looking at 15-20k
---
I’m running off allowance, buster. Can’t afford to keep spending money on this scam.
---
Have you tried the Scan and Repair function in the Launcher?
---
Open the **Bethesda**.net **Launcher** and click on the game icon to select the game you want to **repair**. Click on the Options link to open the options window. Select **Scan and Repair** and the **launcher** will immediately start **scanning** the game files to validate them.
---
Alright thanks mate!
---
Thank ya kindly!
---
It's a good game. 
---
It's a bad Fallout game.
---
Psn pmoto82 I'm always down to team up and welcome to the fallout world
---
well, stupidity needs to be punished
---
So they're sourcing the data for a *live* player tracker from articles from 6 months ago? That's amazing.
---
Wait, what?
---
Thanks G
---
downvoted for the truth
---
*Due to a bug protest signs have been removed*
---
NO. they're tracking network usage. I thought you were asking about the other numbers I referenced. I did not take notes, only took note of the general trends.
---
Fo76 private servers and ho's over there! lol
---
Uglier than 4? Having played Fallout 4 and 76 back to back recently, I can say with absolute certainty, that 76 does have better graphics than 4 in every department that I've noticed. It's not by a whole lot, but it's a noticeable difference.
---
Lmao every now and then I ask myself how Bethesda can fuck themselves over more than they already have, and each time they come out on top with some new stupid shit.  Can't believe people are still playing this trash ass game.
---
naw but its ok for society to ridicule bad choices. its part of human nature. we live in a society etc
---
FO76 has me addicted to the legendary system.  FO4 the settlement (CAMP building) system.
---
something like that
---
Bill2million mention reddit
---
I was filled with ennui.
---
The game introduces the mechanics as you leave the vault, and you don’t even have much to consume yet. And the first few missions of the game walk you through more detail of managing food &amp; water in this game. So I think there’s something in your question I’m missing
---
I usually wait for people to finish up at my vendors out of politeness and the want for caps, but sometimes I need to log off quick and someone is taking their sweet time so I just do it. Not much to be done.
---
The weight reduction perks are so you can not be overencumbered. They don't apply to stash.
---
Wtf no they are not 😄 I have 1st, no one cares.
---
Projection 101. First, you shift the goal posts when someone provides you with evidence: "that was BEFORE the game came out!" (as if the means anything: a promise is a promise). 
---
And then you go with a very narrow and disingenuous definition of pay to win: after all, in a game without any meaningful competitive gameplay outside of Nuclear Winter, then it could be argued that *nothing* Bethesda could sell players could constitute pay to win, couldn't it? But no, the term is obviously being deployed here to mean any kind of transaction which nets you an in-game advantage (it doesn't have to be over other players). 
---
To anyone who isn't desperate to defend Bethesda's dirty dealings, it is entirely obvious that a) they have gone back on their word, and b) they shouldn't be charging for things which bring the game more closely in line—even if only by the smallest of increments—with what it should have been at launch. If Bethesda were half as decent a company as they used to be, they would have done a No Man's Sky and set to quietly working away on adding a boatload of free content to the game as an apology to those who trusted them enough to drop any amount of money on a game that still, to this day, isn't worth it. Alternatively, they could have done an FFXIV and pulled the game down for a reboot, so that the next time we have the opportunity to play the game, it actually looks and plays like a title that at least partially lives up to the Fallout legacy. But no, they chose instead to go ham on cramming as much overpriced crap into the Atomic Store as they could, while failing to deliver anything of substance with their 1/16th-@$$ed content drops. And now, they want to users to play a subscription for things that any company with any sort of shame would offer for free.
---
I don't support griefing players, but I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for those who are directly supporting, or defending, Bethesda's bad practices. Those players are not doing themselves, the community, or even Bethesda any favours.
---
reminds me of triads in Hong Kong
---
Who's triggered? You took time out of your life to make a meme and post it on reddit. 
---
And how are you accusing someone of "flinging mud" after posting this? How big of a hypocrite can you be? Or are you just plain stupid?
---
*bugged
---
ty gonna give it a try, been itching for fps kind of rpg
---
Well what do we have here
---
The definition of pay to win is literally the definition that Bethesda uses. When the developers actually define what pay to win is in their eyes that is the definition you have to you. It doesn't matter what you think of as pay to win at that point.
---
You act like the "promise" as you put it is something that the company has to follow. When that promise is made by one man who has people above him who can easily override whatever he says then it doesn't mean anything. They did try for a long time to abide by what was said but again he does not have the final decision in this.
---
No problem :)
---
at least they got something done right
---
Yes but you’re never going to get those few people to stop buying it and if there are those few people buying it, it makes it worth it
---
Wow it's a good job this community can't see our real colours or sexualty if this is anything to go by. Anyway I thought they were all so ragged up they'd all deleted?
---
u/T4Gx : cheap fallout ripoff lol
---
Also you: (posts and comments on r/theouterworlds)
---
not me. im without asshole - and opinion
---
Damn. I'd say get a job but I take it that's not in the cards.
---
It is jammed packed with great one liners so far
---
Goodness me. LOL
---
Just trust me, it's 100% a fake site, lol. It's plastered with ads for a reason and they actually even lie on the site saying "Ad blockers may prevent stats from updating, please whitelist us", which is not true at all.  The ads they have setup are given an "impression" each time someone hits the update button, which is how the person running the site makes money off it.   
---
I imagine most game developers would rather keep the competition from knowing what their player base is like and unless the game is on Steam exclusively or they release numbers themselves you have no way of knowing the exact numbers.
---
Don't lump us all together.  If someone else does not choose to subscribe, whatever the reason, that doesn't effect my opinion of them, nor should it.  Maybe they can't justify the expense, they prioritize something else more highly when spending money on entertainment, or don't want to contribute to the project's bottom line because while they're happy enough at the moment to play, they're choosing to show the degree of dissatisfaction or disappointment with the state of the game and/or recent company moves by not paying into a system they don't think is worth supporting financially right now - or probably a myriad of other reasons I couldn't guess if I tried because *I'm not them*.  I don't need to know why they don't subscribe, it's their decision and I respect that.
---
Anyone making implications that folks who aren't interested or currently don't have the free budget space are somehow less is in the wrong.
---
But making assumptions about the reasoning of anyone who has subscribed is just as wrong - and going beyond that to either make blanket statements about subscribers, or to go so far as to support griefing on any basis of real or assumed identifiers (in the current discussion "being a subscriber" or to invite comparison/contrast all the people this summer who got - some continue to get - griefed for using the Pride icon) is also wrong.
---
I actually had switched back to a different icon partly out of whim, partly out of inspiration about the directional shift I was planning on taking my CAMP/vending in.  Next log in I'll be switching it back before heading into adventure mode, because with everyone so prone to hasty statements about fresh experiences, openly displaying that I paid less than the cost of a nice dinner for something so many are shouting to the rafters makes me an idiot.  I'll cycle out the rest of the weekend into midweek when the daytime demographic is most representative of the server populations I'm typically online with.
---
If the vitriolic polarization is in action/reaction as blatant as it's seeming here, then I'll may have to count the money wasted, be ironically grateful that I only paid for one month because timing wasn't right just now for $100 at once, and know that while the game certainly still has many things broken, it's a break within the community that might be the proverbial final straw.
---
I hope the better elements of the community prove the more prominent, because it will be difficult finding something else that will not only be entertaining enough to hold my interest almost daily for approaching a year, but also provide a gaming experience that my Wife and I have a similar enough opinion on that it's a shared activity at least a few times a week.
---
At this point I should likely apologize for what feels like having hijacked your portion of the comment threads.
---
You can do both. Not at the same time but Just saying..
---
I don't trust you. I believe you have a bias. I don't trust that site 100% but I'd guess from known numbers that at least on 76 their numbers are within 10% margin of error. I use ghostery. If there's ads on that site I didn't see them and didn't get any whitelist requests. But all the same cheers.
---
It wouldn't bother me as much if it weren't squeezed into your face so distastefully. Every time I open my menu now I am reminded by the greyed out "Survival Tent" coupled with the Fallout 1st logo, that I paid full price for a game I can't play all of and that it will likely be just one of many things the "other players" get.
---
There is a difference between malfeasance, and ineptitude.
---
How many times have you made a choice for something, and then later on decided something different?
---
I've had my game crash while people were spending. I always wonder if they think I'm just a dick. 😂
---
Yeah more New Vegas world space(with actual content) to play in would be great
---
*imagines all the new glitches*
---
I like it. It think the price is fine.  I don’t consider this a DLC nor do I  consider this a “broken” promise by Bethesda.  It gives no advantages and I just see this as a discounted atoms with some extra incentives package that do not negativity effect the world.   This community has a lot of good but can be very toxic and I think it’s a silly thing to crucify them for this.  12.99 a month isn’t an awful price point and I think as long as wasterlanders and any other DLC that comes out remains free, I’m all for it.
---
I have tried but it didn't work like the button was like nonono cause I couldn't even download it but maybe this petition will somehow help us

I bought about 200 caps from a vendor, yet the vendor still stayed at 0.

Its not hard to understand. They essentially copied the Korean MMO model of creating really grindy mechanics and then sold us the solution to avoid those mechanics all for the low price of 14 USD per month. Newsflash those tactics are decades old and have never been accepted in western culture and surprise surprise we dont ever rly get korean MMOs releasing in the West because of how scummy this practice is.
---
they probably don't give too much of a fuck and are after their paychecks in this really competitive scene known as video game development
---
lets face it friends no one but a handful of lads give a damn about fallout anymore, higher ups look it as a more approachable series than TES thus riddle it with trivial shit like Shelter and 76, and devs just want to be done with the day and go home to their families just like 90% of us.

I can help you out in about an hour or so if you haven't found anyone before then.

Gonna miss role-playing as a raider/psychopath. RIP Survival mode. Back to baby mode I guess.

yes dito. and people have shown they will accept anything and still say "dont see the problem". well, if paying a corporation that is deceitful and greedy for a game does not bother you, who am i to say anything.

this subscription and the passive reaction to it has shown me they will get away with anything. they can lie and directly contradict their promises and people will still go with the dozens of repeated fallacies that ultimately does not answer for the lies or malpractice ("its only a game"; "its my opinion"; "i dont see the problem because &lt;insert reason to like the game while ignoring the future of it&gt;", etc).
---
like, i get it. who has time for hate. but to me, bethesda has lied too much. im tired of the energy it takes to believe bethesda.
---
this is long? boy oh boy you haven't seen some posts around here trying to spin off things in bethesda's favor with goddamn 2000 word essays
---
It's hilarious that you have such a fawning, pathetic admiration for this company that not only do you want to give them a free pass to break all the promises they wish without suffering any consequences, but also the right to exercise sole control over the definition of words. It's rare to meet a genuine fanboy in the wild (you might disagree, so perhaps ask your Bethesda overlords whether you meet the criteria for THEIR definition of the word), but you, Sir, surely qualify.
---
Could you imagine what it'd be like for a long term fan of Fallout &amp; Bethesda watching their once beloved franchise go down the toilet due to incompetence &amp; greed to then have an outsider who knows very little of the situation at hand come on here and laugh at &amp; made fun of these fans?
---
Yeah bud. You might want to check yourself. Your hypocrisy is showing.
---
Um, what? 
---
You're more then able to carry around the same spec weapons and you dont get any penalty.
---
Idc what you say really, each post like yours just makes me feel good inside that my post got to people clearly. Negative or positive I like all reactions :p
---
yaay, eat the rich, class struggle forever
---
Gotta team up before you go in  and youll get the option: play as team
---
They actually said what they won't put in the game. The fact that YOU think that your definition matters more is what the actual problem is. You don't get to tell them what to put in their game and the fact that you think otherwise is asinine.
---
my man I've been playing cod for this last two days and a) campaign is fucking brutal, first time I've felt the ugly side of war in a fps b) MP is really cool as gunplay really changed a lot c) its not fo76
---
some good reasons to play I'd say. campaign is especially beautiful if you are into military thrillers
---
criticism is not complaining
---
Actually im harassing everyone i see wearing or using 1st gear :) its mean and im okay with it. Mayne they'll get mad and quit
---
Shotguns got nerfed into the ground patches ago. Strongest builds are commandos, heavy guns, melee
---
I've been using that icon since it came out and haven't had anyone bother me about it yet.  There are a few bad eggs out there but I think the community is pretty friendly overall.
---
Damn internet Sherlock Holmes over here.
---
You're right, because this 76 team is going to do a bang up job on a single player Fallout 5...
---
I think we nuke the fuck out of valt tec university
---
I'm just annoyed that they're putting 90% of the Halloween rewards in NW to try to get us to play it.  
---
If I wanted to played a battle royale game, I'd go play one lol
---
I just went to site and it $23 a month in Australia. Yeah I don’t think I’ll try it. That’s just gouging.....
---
Thats what I use, heavy melee &amp; Automatic commando
---
You are aware modders do a better job of finishing off and adding items then bethesda themselves have ever done right?
---
Yeah I got one today.
---
What always got me were the invisible walls. Like, there's no reason I shouldn't be able to walk over this 45° incline other than the devs just don't want me to.
---
I’m with you, brother
---
Then why are you asking about worthless shotguns? They killed shotguns as any viable build a while ago
---
I can see your point.  However, in most Korean MMO games you start with an disadvantage which force to buy.  There are no disadvantages to not having Fallout 1st.  I just think it’s a crazy thing to be upset at.  It’s 12.99 a month, that’s a McDonald’s meal.  I would say we should wait until wasterlanders to decide whether or not we should completely ban Bethesda.  I wouldn’t compare them to Korean MMO titles just yet.  This is still new, it could change or it may not.  I just think the hate is too much for something like this.  I do see where you’re coming from though. I appreciate ya commenting!
---
Don’t recall eso bullshitting anybody about charges and plans for their game though do you?
---
So you're going back to the point you already conceded? You're as stupid as you are dishonest.
---
Long for me, haha.  I’m not for Bethesda, I’m for the community and I’m putting the little faith I have in them to create someone magical for us.
---
Lol good point. Maybe we should just hope Bethesda sells the rights to obsidian or someone
---
Ya I would not buy this sub even at the USD price.  It is insane they are trying to sell us solutions to the grindy mechanics they intentionally placed in the base game. Furthermore, switching to a korean style monetisation system is a rly bad sign that the devs believe this game is essentially done and they are gonna milk the whales they have left.
---
I'm on xbox it makes me sad to see you go why you leaveing?
---
I had legendaries tonight all over on my private as I was leveling an alt. Had a few spawn where I hadn't seen them before too. I can not say anything about west tek or WS or even SBQ just what I found as I did workshop farming and exploring around.
---
Obviously you don't know how to read so I felt I had to say it again. You go ahead and think whatever you want buddy but I'm not the one throwing a bunch of hate at a game that I paid for and continue to play even though I hate it ;)
---
Same, I played the game up until the latest patch notes. In fact I had stopped because of poor hardware performance and updated just last Friday and was excited to get started again, until I read those damn patch notes. I feel disgusted to log in again.
---
Likewise it was just the server subscription it wouldn't have been a big deal either. People are mad that there are new gameplay mechanics being added that they don't get. I think calling it Pay 2 Win misses the point, there is no real winning in the main game anyway. But it is definitely making second class players out of their loyal fans.
---
Whatever then, I've given you like five different reasons that site is inaccurate and you've dismissed each one for no reason really, while not even providing one link or any sort of proof the site is legit, but sure, I'm the biased one.
---
i made a post elsewhere. but in short, this has killed the game for me.
---
im not a spender so bethesda doesnt care. but i did. now your choices have enabled their egregious behavior to the point that the game development is taking a hit. bottomline? im not playing the game anymore.
---
having spent 60 USD on the promise that it would be non-subscription makes me feel entitled to the opinion that my investment was screwed over by a literal lie, and you enabled them.
---
You may enjoy /r/fo76FilthyCasuals more than this subreddit.
---
16 Times!
---
Maybe a glitch- I have a handful of ‘duplicate’ weapons, and haven’t had issues carrying both
---
You gave me one: that they had ads. I never said it's legit, I said it's likely within 10% accurate going off numbers that have been released and likely decline of daily usage. It's strange that a random banner-ad farm as you suggest would have a bias against 76. Also, it's a rather ill-conceived farm at that as it certainly isn't a high traffic model. But cheers.
---
Wont very home till Monday, but I can join. Level 77 (or something close)
---
I think someone mentioned the reason being GST. Still a bit silly.
---
Ok thanks
---
What's your gamer tag?
---
Just trying to point out that it would suck to be a little guy in the company receiving so much hate. Didn't mean to offend but your probably right, the last paragraph might have been a bit to much on the sarcastic side, I was just trying to make light of the rampant hate by people I saw on youtube who for the most part haven't even played the game.
---
"Apneac"
---
Not for server subscriptions, that stuff costs money to run. But adding the survival tent to the atom store would have made this slightly more palatable. At least I know I could grind for it if I wanted, it would keep the player base on an equal footing as someone could have bought or grinded for things.  
---
I really want to support this game too, like monetarily. I get that it is hard to offer something both worthwhile and not balance breaking. A major out of world DLC could get my money, but paying for minor gameplay mechanics is not going to happen.
---
Or Maryland deal with it, like the original plan.
---
ELIMINATE THE UPPER CLASS
---
If you are measuring general opinion on the game by those actively playing the game then by definition you have already prejudiced your observations.
---
They run on Amazon web servers.  An Amazon server in Sydney is about 20% more expensive than an AWS server in Ohio.  I'd say that's the answer right there.  Microsoft just announced they're going to globalise the Azure pricing, so perhaps Amazon will follow suit at some point.
---
So I think that's at least part of the driver - hosting in Europe and Asia is more per instance than in the USA, so Bethesda is just marking it up and selling it on.  My real problem with this is that ALL THE CONTENT IN FALLOUT 1ST SHOULD BE FREE.  Seriously.  It's barely even OK content, there is no way at all I'd even spent $3/month on what they're offering, let alone AUD 22.
---
From what I’ve seen, a lot of people who hate it bought it anyway, generally for the ranger armor just for 1 month and also because scrapbox is pretty useful. We may see worse numbers next month, but based on the less upvoted posts on the subreddit Bethesda is probably sitting on a fat stack of cash at the moment that they probably won’t want to get rid of. (I uninstalled the game, don’t blame anyone who bought the subscription, these are just my observations)
---
my man since you typed a long post I wanted to return the favor
---
* they have lied about cosmetic only approach
---
* they have specifically lied about stash size
---
* they have not added a worthwhile singleplayer content since march (yeah yeah V94 it literally stripped you clean for a month and it is too laggy now) and delayed Wastelanders until q1 2020 (it should be in a good state when it releases, true, but that doesn't justify the fact that they failed to deliver on time)
---
* they have 2 weeks ago pledged to add more non-cosmetic items through atomic shop, expect canners, ammo converters, completely new weapons etc
---
* they have not fixed many bugs and issues plaguing this game for months yet they have fixed stasher bug in three days
---
the issue is, my man, if the game was in a better state no one would set everything on fire but game is in a really lackluster and broken state. right now from the top of my head;
---
* a whole set of weapons (shotguns) are broken
---
* some legendary prefixes are broken
---
* many atom challenges are broken
---
* quest markers are AWOL all the time
---
* balance is in shambles
---
* many plans, items are not available or available with a droprate of 0.25% or some shit like that etc I could go oooon and ooooon
---
and with all this bullshit they add FF, taking advantage of people who are too emotionally connected to the game of course along with laid back fellers who just don't give a shit about 15USD / month or state of the gaming industry - which is fine btw.
---
As someone who didn’t buy fallout 76 I have to admit I’m getting way more enjoyment from it than my average game purchase. Watching dumpster fire after dumpster fire spring from 76 over the past year has been divine.
---
stillll loving youuuuuuuu
---
thats a good song, unrelated to the subject at hand tho fuck bethesda
---
Yeah I'm up to 12 on one character and stuck at 6 on the other.
---
Ight see you then
---
its nice out there mate screw bethesda go to a beach, gold coast was amazing yesterday
---
I never suggested the site had a bias against 76. I said the site was not a legitimate source and was obviously a clickbait site designed to get you to refresh the page over and over again (thinking you are checking player counts) in order to get the owner of the site impressions for their ads. I even told you that most game developers don't release their player counts. That's one of the statistics companies are able to withhold when they run their own game launcher like Bethesda does with 76 and doesn't put it on Steam.
---
The part that hurt me the most was the part about unlimited scrap space which was meant to be a main game feature
---
Having come from warframe, this is like mediocre?
---
Same here. Totally agree with OP. We love this game, anyone who stuck with it through the first couple of months after launch before Wild Appalachia know how bad it was. I know personally when Bethesda started adding good content I bought cosmetics because I wanted to try and support them. Now it feels like I just wasted my money because the support I did give them just wasn’t enough.
---
Fuck them but fuck I love this game. I get a whole like 3 hours to play this game a week and i fucking love it
---
Gaming the system/using a group of players to influence a bigger group of players to change the way they behave for increased monetary gain on the system's part? Wow, that sounds just like some Illuminati conspiracy shit, where the Man keeps ya down by making you hate on each other rather than who's really the one holding all the moneybags and missile drones... that is to say "Myth: Plausible".
---
Yea screw them i could use that $180 to go on a drive and admire This beautiful country
---
Of course they don't release daily numbers. Of course this is an estimate. I see no ads. I'm sorry you're on some 1988 internet explorer or some shit. But, you are arguing with someone else I think... at no point did I say this is the official absolute accurate... I said it is likely given the number bethesda themselves have released last quarter and the estimated decline since. This is tedious. Cheers! (that means, next reply gets you blocked)
---
I would agree but the problem is Bethesda released this at the right time. Releasing this after Wastelanders was delayed several months wasn't the right thing to do. If Wastelanders released and it was a great expansion that brought Fallout 76 closer to what people expect a Bethesda Fallout to be, I think releasing bFallout 1st wouldn't have had nearly the backlash. At least then you can see that your money is being put to good use in support of a game you love.
---
The problem is right now there really isn't anything going on with the game. There are only so many times you can do the same repeating quests or events before you just get bored. Not having a major expansion release in the first year of Fallout 76's life cycle was a massive error, but then they see the premium pass being added, you are going to get an upset fsnbase.
---
Me? Not offended in the least. Just pointing out your hypocrisy &amp; sanctimony. 
---
You're right that some devs do deserve some sympathy. Not all. The people who handle the code versioning are independently incompetent from anything upper management related. Same too with QA, given personal account of people in the community who were invited to the studio for some testing &amp; feedback &amp; devs were blown away at how quick &amp; effective amateurs were at spotting bugs during their play testing. 
---
On the other hand, the Dallas team (battle royale) &amp; Atom Store devs deserve high praise. They're both doing a great job overall.
---
&gt;. I'm deleting anyone on my friends lists that so much as visits a private world.
---
How very mature of you.
---
You are wasting your time explaining this, everyone already knows the difference between individual items and stacks of integers, that’s why we’ve been begging for this change since launch and Bethesda decides to create a problem and put it behind a paywall instead
---
You are not my friend. You are my brother, my friend!
---
People defending GTAO......
---
You bought a participation trophy lmao.
---
No, you're the guy who plays a terrible game devoid of worthwhile content, defends a scummy company who has their sights set on exploiting you, and on top of that you throw good money after bad by supporting their subscriptions and micro transactions. I, on the other hand, held out some hope for the game because I saw that it had promise; but when it became clear that Bethesda had no intention of fulfilling that promise, because milking idiots was more lucrative and/or they didn't have a clue how to fix their game, I jumped ship. 
---
I've kept an eye on the game since then, because I thought that the laws of probability might mean that Bethesda would eventually do something with the game that didn't actively make it worse, but every news update and development since the time of uninstalling has only made it clear that there's no hope for this game; especially not when there are STILL people like you who will run interference for Bethesda and empty the contents of your wallets into their coffers, rather than holding them to any kind of account.
---
Good job, you.
---
:) Great opportunity for PVP players.
---
Get FO-1st... wait to be targeted... PVP
---
What do you mean
---
Fucking amen. It's beautiful. There is so much in this game that is being damaged by bad marketing and management
---
I tested it and you are correct about being able to do it more than once per day.
---
However, everything else I said is indeed correct. Please do not mislead people by discrediting the entire response.
---
I paid 11k for mine.
---
More people need to understand this. It’s not the developers, it’s not the people who bought subscription (I’m not defending it, I uninstalled the game), it’s not the community managers. It’s the big wigs in zenimax flexing their money boner to the world. The studio developing 76 is primarily Bethesda Austin, they haven’t made a fallout game before so they had the shitty creation engine dumped on them and asked to make a multiplayer game out of single player code. This doesn’t excuse all the bugs - corporate should have allowed for more development time and focus on those first - but the studio is at the whim of Zenimax suits.
---
Since you arent actually playing the game then you have no idea what is actually going on in it. They have been actively making it better in general but you wouldn't know that. You only know what you see from the people who are constantly complaining. You try to call me out when I actually experience everything that goes on with the game and more since I'm also a mod author and a dataminer. Maybe try actually looking yourself and making a decision instead of blindly believing all the stupid hate that goes on.
---
Lmao im posting this to gaming circlejerk
---
A guy overwrote your camp with his fo1st base tent?
---
They probably removed dismemberment because you can damage enemies by hitting their dropped appendages.
---
You idiots seriously STILL don't get it?  
---
BETHESDA IS USING YOU STOP GIVING THEM MONEY!!!  FFS!!!
---
Red and pink. Thats it.
---
Honestly, I don’t see it going away. I wanted the subscription for the same reason as you, so I uninstalled to keep from being tempted - but I totally get anyone who buys it, it’s an almost necessary and absolutely interesting bundle if you get it. But based on the posts I’ve seen a lot of people who hate it bought it anyway. It won’t be until they can’t start putting out good items and they’ve started losing players for good that they will take the subscription away.
---
Honestly, probably encountered this when someone came to my camp, saw the scrap box and just kept shooting me over and over again until they gave up and fast travelled away. Either that or they noticed I had the Ranger uniform from New Vegas on...
---
Absolutely pathetic, imagine being this much of a blind fanboying shill lmao
---
Was actually gonna say this same exact thing. It's only happened once or twice that I know of for sure. But i really hope they don't just think I was an ass. Lol, because I always check and make sure I don't have a customer before I log off.
---
Fuck my entire existence
---
Well I just seen it $23 for a month.... like WTF. That’s crazy money for this.
---
Hmm let me try it out
---
How is it Bethesdas fault for us constantly getting mad at them when they add things to the game. I've called them out plenty of times before for bs they've pulled but I also support the game and want it to keep going. Saying this is Bethesdas fault when from the beginning the people here and on the forums have shit on Bethesda when the team that developed this game was shoved into it with little to no knowledge of the engine. We still have a very good game as they are constantly making updates to try to make things better. They listen to our feedback but if all the feedback is just torches and pitchforks instead of actual talk about things then they are forced to ignore it. People have jumped at the smallest things like when they added repair kits. Then that died down fast. Same with scrap kits. Same with the fridge and collection. It just goes on and on with people constantly hating on the game. No matter what improvements they do add people can't see past anything else
---
I am surprised that there actually is FO 1st players.
---
"of course they don't release daily numbers"
---
you do realize it says "**LIVE PLAYER TRACKER**" on every single page, right? If it's an estimate why does it change every time I refresh the page? How far are you going to backtrack so you can be right on Reddit again? Please do block me, if you can't comprehend an ad-blocker that can be toggled on and off, there's not much of a chance you can comprehend anything else I said.
---
What part of the outer worlds did this happen in ?
---
I bought the year subscription. I love this game dearly and play almost daily so I felt I'd get good use out of everything. I also tend to buy atoms at least once a month because I make impulsive decisions, so getting an "allowance" every month from the sub gives me a reason *not* to buy atoms. I love the emotes so much tbh. Don't really care for the outfit (I think it looks weirder than it did in NV) or the icons. I have yet to go into a private server since I can't actually think of a reason I'd want to be trying to do events alone. The scrap box saved me at most 400lbs in scrap. It's honestly really nice not having to choose between two materials on which to drop to make room for the other, and hoping you don't end up needing all of that later. The tent I originally underestimated. Placing it for free is a huge deal, and while the things it provides I find pretty mundane, being able to pop one down in the middle of a SBQ fight and hide inside for cover, Or to quickly toss valuable loot so you aren't over encumbered, is game-changing. I have no regrets buying the year subscription because I know I'll still be playing a year from now, assuming I don't die or something.
---
If you catch it in on a good sale, yeah. I paid 60$ and I regret it. If you catch it at 50% off, I think it’s worth it. I got about 175 hours before I lost interest
---
I’m also having the same issue with my one foundation mobile base. 
---
Can’t replace it at all since patch 14
---
If your a true fallout fan find a cheap copy. But don’t buy into the private servers unless u have the moneye. Most players are pretty nice but u still have much lag/bugs and server instability they removed very good items from the game and added weight to a lot of items I had stored which is annoying
---
It's a fun game, but Beth is struggling with it's games as service model. I suggest that you get it, but don't support Beth Fallout 1st subscription robbery thing.
---
Except the “rich” in this case are just normal people who bought something for $12 dollars. It’s not like they’re fucking bezos making billions off of the suffering of his workers.
---
I only got the month one and so far I like it
---
The real way to protest is just not playing the game
---
With the 5ocal you can not go back since it didn't have another recover plan. With most other gins you can though
---
Holy shit take my upvote. Love it
---
Delrith, who reviewed F76 for Angry Joe, put over 200 hours into this piece of shit game.  All on stream, live.
---
STOP DEFENDING BETHESDA YOU FUCKING DOLT
---
Yeah how dare they have fun
---
Okay??
---
I rather have fun content than an endless boring grind which is what we have now
---
Yup. U didn't pay the sub so now ur a second class citizen. Welcome to the new fallout experience.
---
Did your daddy buy you fallout 1st, can he buy me it too!? *Kills player*
---
The main story was bad, but the rest of it was a good Fallout game. I'm one of the apparently few people who loved building up settlements though.
---
Its was very devastating. I had picked up a number of furious, berserk guns which I already owned. In the end. They didnt show up on my inventorg. Very upset
---
How did they destroy your camp? Did you shoot back at them? They can’t do damage unless hostile.
---
Maybe it's because you don't know how to build it.
---
I still use shottys after the fix/nerf though I am using a BE one lol.
---
Yeah, ambient is great. I wish they could add more radio stations. I miss Stars On The Midnight Range.
---
Glad to hear! Considering getting a month just for that ranger armor and some temporary sracp storage. However some more ranger armors were datamined, so I'll probably wait a bit and see.
---
You actively supported a greedy bullshit service. They locked things players have been begging for behind a fucking paywall, and you supported that by paying for it even once. You're encouraging future bullshit behavior, and have helped in insuring that the game is only going to get more and more exploitive over time. If you fanboy morons would stop licking Todd Howard's taint and actually demand positive change for the product you claim to love, maybe it'd be in a much better state it's in now. Maybe this entire rediculous controversy could have been avoided. Hell, maybe just maybe the game would have launched in an acceptable state to begin with, maybe the game wouldn't be a total joke to the gaming community. Of course, all those things are and will likely always remain a maybe, because you blind fucking idiots refuse to stop spreading your legs (and wallet) for Bethesda. It's like a mother smoking meth while pregnant and wondering what went wrong with the baby, that's exactly what you dumbfucks are doing. Enjoy you're sinking ship, everyone with an IQ higher than 15 will enjoy watching the catastrophe unfold.
---
Be home in like 2 days and I'll add ya, I'm "apneac" and I'll let ya know when I'm back
---
Its prewar riot gear.
---
I've made every build possible in this game. Shotguns are worthless outside of close range fighting. I prefer dropping my enemies in 2 shots from a distance, not allowing them to get close range at all.
---
Is this some american thing I'm too european to understand?
---
You seem to forget how excited people here were when they launched Wild Appalachia, NW, when they announced Wastelanders, the private servers, yes, people were excited because of the private servers, as excited as they are mad now with this half assed private worlds Bethesda came up with.
---
Bethesda promises, people get excited, Bethesda fails to delivery numerous times and people get mad. Is really that simple.
---
I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think it's NCR Ranger armor. The armor the NCR uses for their rangers is pre-war riot armor salvaged from police stations around Los Angeles and I'm fairly certain that the armor in F76 is riot armor scavenged from the Charleston police department.
---
It sucks that people are getting picked on, that's never okay. But I can't blame people for being frustrated at the people who would support such a terrible business strategy
---
I just love it when someone proceeds to lecture me on my country's history without knowing the first thing about it.
---
[As was preordained.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GnBpsUZDiQ0)
---
Tents are basically a Stand.
---
Its not the NCR armor. Its the Pre war Riot Armor.
---
k so if I don't smoke and drink can I complain about Fallout 1st?
---
Like, what kind of argument is that?
---
Well after checking the website seems like my region is outlandishly expensive. @ conversation $18 usd a monty or $130 year.
---
Sounds like a horrible bug if that's happening. Just a thought, though. Sometimes when you pick up new Legendaries and the display comes up with what you found, sometimes it shows Legendaries already in your inventory. I've thought I've gotten duplicates before but the display is kind of buggy. By habit, I usually look at what it is in the npc's inventory before picking it up.
---
They delivered what they said. It's not like private worlds are the end of it by a long shot. You say people were excited. How long did that last before people started shitting on Bethesda again? Because I seem to remember it really didn't take very long at all. Bethesda never promised that private servers would be free btw. There are a few current bugs with them which are being worked on right now. No company ever releases new stuff with 0 bugs in total.
---
My main is a Strengh build so I use shotguns Heavy weapons, melee. Only Combat shotguns are viable because of Armour Penetration.
---
Also mod your shotgun for max range and accuracy, on a combat shotgun you don't even need skeet shooter.
---
One last thing is that TS effect on shotgun is horrible imo because it diminishes you spread too much, use an Anti Armour, a Mutant, or a Junkies one instead. Or even a Quad just for more ammo.
---
*loads game*
---
*Drives outside garage*
---
*Immediately met with hail of missiles from Oppressor*
---
*Closes game and goes back to Skyrim*
---
remember, it just works
---
It’s not like they’re actually hurting anyone... if you’re going to be upset at a big capitalist entity, at least go after one actually harming people, like amazon or nestle. No one is actually getting hurt from this, you are not forced to buy it, it is not pay to win, it’s a completely optional service for those that want it. 
---
You could also realize that this is a very minor symptom of capitalism and significantly worse shit happens on a daily basis, what Bethesda’s doing is no where near as bad as some of the other shit that capitalism allows.
---
Long story short they had been after me for awhile they shot at me first I left they followed and eventually I fought back killed them booked it they sought revenge and then attacked my camp they had previously found
---
Lmao
---
I don’t think I could work on the series if I was a fan of the series. Bethesda are not handling it well, IMO. I do feel for those guys - but it’s a job, they can go work somewhere else if they’re that disheartened
---
I mean I dont get it why that happens. Its everyone choice how they would like to play a game. I believe buying sub, in this case, is punishment enough, without any necessery bullying.
---
Then it depends on how you define close, shotguns are of course relatively close ranged. I'd say they have decent range if you max their range.
---
But a buff in range/damage fall off would be much appreciated.

This is about much more than food &amp; water.
---
I left the Vault a year ago and completed the first missions. I haven't played (progressed) really in a long time. I have forgotten all the little that I learned then. I don't even remember the basic controls. I can not progress, because I get killed every time when travelling. I have no friends, so no-one is helping me. I have very little health because of rads. I don't have any radaways. I don't even know how to build the C.A.M.P. I have not built anything. I have never played a Fallout game or even "western" role-playing game like this.
---
Yes, I don't have food and I drink polluted water because I don't have anything else. So I can't read the help pages.
---
There is really no good reason to not be able to access full settings while in the main menu.
---
Ooh yeah. Just like Blizzard. We sure showed them, Reddit! Let's get outraged for a week and then move on to another ineffective outrage movement!
---
If you are measuring general opinion on the game by those who aren't actively playing the game then you are a moron.
---
Bethesda doesn't and shouldn't care what a subreddit that's mostly full of people who haven't played the game in months think about the game.
---
as all things 76: supply your own narrative (far less of a headache that way)
---
I mean I'll let you play how you want, but Bethesda probably won't for long
---
It's like the amazing music of GOT S8 -- so many great themes amongst the mess...
---
It's going to be "mod support" like for 4.  
---
Buy our mods.
---
No why would it be, I guess you can’t see the rationale for this. But fallout 76 uncommon business model resolves around the fact that any player given enough time can earn for free what others pay for but  to off-set this everything has to come from the store. It’s a very silly business model and you bet they regret it so, I even think they are looking at ways to transition away from this model but unless they plan to just stuff it and start anew, people like yourself are going to be angry whichever way they go because you don’t realise how lucky you really are.
---
why is OP and most of the people replying on month old accounts with only a couple hundred karma. I get that the sub is being negative since fallout first but this is such bad fake post its cringy.
---
They hate us all brother. They definitely hover over as many as they can before shit comes flying out of every Orifice
---
You don't need yo subscribe to know that it's worth the price at face value, I mean did you see the Atoms?
---
As for real value I doubt if it's worth it to pay for this game at all, after buying the game.
---
Yeah, the stock prices over the last year were totally due to the recent HK Reddit outrage and not because they haven't released much and the reception to what they have released was lukewarm at best.
---
Actually it sounds like you didn’t read their argument at all, just copy pasted some cookie cutter response about stash limits that everyone already knows, gee what an original opinion!
---
I paid 10k for mine, it’s really bad had max rifle men cards barely killed ghouls
---
What do you not understand?
---
The help section should be available to read when not in danger of dying, being attacked by creatures and other players, other players interacting, health, food and drink bars dwindling.
---
Maybe they are not good with numbers
---
Don’t think it will be when he’s included the name in the url
---
Definitely not the open world part because there is none.
---
What, you think wastelanders DLC will be free? I mean, Bethesda specifically said that all DLC's will be free, which means that they will absolutely charge you money for it now. Have fun everyone! Lol.
---
It's not even the executives. They're doing what they're allowed to under our economic system that encourages and facilitates prioritizing profits over customers or even human rights. The issue isn't the devs' or the studio, it's the system that allows these huge corporations to exist and exploit their workers for more and more profits.
---
I don’t use atoms I still have all of my atoms over earned. Have no interest in atoms TBH
---
So far CoD has been an incredible experience and a treat to play. I'm done with FO76, at least MW was a finished product
---
Get it as cheap as you can and DO NOT buy the fallout 1st service. Great game but the paid service is pointless. The bugs in the main base game adventure mode are the same if not worse in the paid private world.
---
Then it's just you, it doesn't affect the package at face value.
---
Just get another game development job 4Head
---
I had the same thing last night. Private server was fine for a while, then legendaries just stopped spawning. It seemed like it was maybe due to the length of time I was on (about 3-4 hours by the point the bug appeared). First noticed in Leader of the pack, no starred mobs. Then again in Uranium Fever, nothing. I had done a Uranium Fever several hours earlier on the same server and it had all 3 legendaries. Someone else in my friends list was complaining about the same thing in their private server.
---
Same here. Shit was annoying af
---
You can’t place a tent in an existing base, even if you’re friends and on a team. Tents follow the same rules as a CAMP does.
---
People who like the Fallout franchise?
---
single player &gt; multy player
---
Oof, sorry about that. It’s pretty shitty that people are actually trying to ruin other people’s fun because of something relatively minor that was just blown WAY out of proportion. I do gotta recommend just not engaging in pvp at all in the future so shit like that doesn’t happen again.
---
I second your heavy gun reasoning. I’m moving away from bloodied myself and getting on this type a build
---
When you play the old Fallout 1 and two, you might release how far we have strayed from what the franchise once was.
---
It’s an extremely vocal minority. I see a LOT of players, half or more of the ones I see on many server per day, with Fallout 1st content.
---
When you pay 60 quid with the promise of only cosmetic monetisation you ARE entitled to what you pay for... do you have any idea how buying things is meant to work?
---
Criticism is allowed to use names.
---
Then how is his under what used to be my vending machines
---
He left but I can send you a picture of my half eaten base if you like
---
yawn, more backtracking. In your original comment you said the numbers haven't broken 40k, how would you know that for sure if these are estimates?
---
I can confirm that they are here and paying attention. It's also a weekend and they usually have weekends off. All 3 of them are in my datamining discord.
---
No, but I'm sorry, levity is complacency, and Bethesda is watching for that, some people are starting to slip back into the normal routine of content and it's disgusting. Bethesda watches this Subreddit, and they shouldn't see anything but backlash right now.
---
I love the fallout franchise, this game is still a flaming disaster
---
Can you elaborate on the last part , what very good items did they remove from the game , and I’ve never come across Bethesda adding weight to items ?
---
Australia is a very long way away, the transport costs add up.
---
During the outage on Friday evening I went back to GTAO to play some tennis and was killed three times on my way to the court!
---
Well It’s basically like Fallout 4 with multiplayer. And Fallout 4 was a great game.
---
There those Australians go again, destroying the planet without a thought...
---
Add a silencer a sneak for 2x dmg
---
it was NEVER a game of the year!
---
How is the subscription costing atoms and giving you atoms making any sort of sense in this case? People treat this like a battle pass when it's literally just renting out a private world with a few bonus perks to go with it. Check how much private servers cost to host on other games and you'll see this isn't really that much at all compared to many other games
---
Disregard the other commenter who said it’s not possible. You used to not be able to switch back and forth between recievers but that issue was fixed a while back
---
I’ve seen better grammar
---
I still think it's just cosmetics and a few things to help you do something quicker a tiny bit.. Nothing to get worked up over. But I still feel like they will honor the free DLC thing. Fallout 1st isn't a DLC is just a Sub like ESO in my opinion.
---
I don't think they are really lying. I don't know programming too well but I'll try to explain.
---
The games mechanics is that every unique object in game has an "id", everyone played pc versions of TES and 3d fallouts would know.
---
For junks/aid/food, every one of the same type of junk/aid food has the same id, that's why they can stack, to the game it's just a change in the value of 1 object.
---
For every other thing that cannot stack in game, they have unique ids and are treated as different objects, as more objects created, more loading is needed, and will cause strain to the game. Sometimes you can already see this loading issue when trading with traders wearing WWR armour pieces to store weapons on them.
---
Share.
---
But isn’t that literally what reddit always does?
---
I think you may have missed the parts of the announcement of private worlds where they said that they are working on things like mod support, larger camp areas and budgets. The issue currently with the restricting players is kind of a bug that they are also working on. As for the limit on the player count: this is an entirely new feature and they wanted to be safe with it instead of break everything for everyone.
---
You're a fun guy I bet. How much do shills get paid?
---
I'd love for players to group up and attack me, honestly I wish they'd remove the player tracker from the map and allow for full on open world pvp.
---
Awesome thanks.
---
Off for the night, gonna be on tomorrow at all?
---
The way the game is going lately... well, I ain't a communist but I get where they're coming from.
---
Ya it’s 20$ a month in my region and even for a regular player who loves the game everything you listed sounds like a massive waste of money on my part and effort in Bethesda when it could have been focused elsewhere. How does it feel to have paid over 200$ for an unfinished game where the creators have proved they are only looking to gouge you
---
You act like the people developing the game aren't fans of the franchise. They actually are but they are constrained by the management they have and can't just do whatever they want. You're just as bad as the rest of the people shitting on the game when you act this way towards someone who took the time to come here and try to show everyone the point of view of the actual developers who care about this game but are not in control of how the game works.
---
Oh yeah that will be amazing. 8 players on the entire map trying to kill eachother.. would surprise me if you saw eachother in the first week online.
---
Yeah I'll be on tomorrow, I'm UK based so will be about 9pm (ish)
---
You sound like a little bitch, don’t get your panties in a wad because you got called out for your BS. Go get griefed or get good, either way you deserve to fall in a fissure with all your junk on you for being such a shill.
---
Although I understand and respect the realism, having junk not weight anything would make my life much-much easier, by allowing to not micro-manage every pound I have.. and perhaps I could stop using Excavator Armor and become more viable on the field for a change.
---
So it sounds like you should be mad at Bethesda and not the other players.. isn’t that the whole point of your post? The hypocrisy is fucking cringe and the fact that you don’t see it would be laughable if you weren’t such a pathetic person, I genuinely feel bad for your existence and how people around you must feel.
---
Yeah outrage then attack players that paid for it the descent to toxicity and how fast it became toxic really does disappoint me tbh I loved the game due to the community
---
An example. Point is, people are complaining about a type of entertainment that is less expensive than other forms of entertainment they spend money on unthinkingly.
---
So there are still bugs?
---
Anyone who downvoted you is a fucking sheep.
---
To be honest if it's that simple I doubt this would be considered an issue in the first place. Clearly you havent had griefers stalk you through a server before and harass you
---
I mean, the mobile gacha model is pretty exploitative and trash but was successful and all of Asia copied it from the Japanese.
---
And it also started crippling into desktop/console games. 
---
The thing with the "vote with your wallet" argument is that doesn't work. Companies just know how to use marketing to their favor to such extend that is not possible to stop even the shittiest game selling models because companies bet on Whales.
---
Uh huh. Because you aren't just a nameless mindless drone among all the others who are toxic and hateful just because others are toxic and hateful. You can't even come up with anything clever you're just basically telling me to go die and quit playing this game which is just so worn out by this point. I bet you endorse the use of exploits to grief people as well? How about hacking in nw cuz from the sound of it either you don't give a crap and are here specifically to troll which btw is against the rules of the subreddit or you don't play the game and just follow along with every person who is mad just because it seems like the fun thing to do.
---
ESO's subscription was supposed to [include all DLC](https://i.postimg.cc/90Bf5cKh/eso-plus-5-27-17-2.jpg) at no additional charge so they called the new content 'chapters' instead of DLC. I'm expecting to see something similar with 76.
---
Still a flaming bug ridden disaster.
---
i don't think wastelanders will be paywalled. but i do expect a disappointment because fallout! and because they released subscriptions first. if they had a great product right around the corner they would've waited until after to mitigate the drama surrounding the monthly fee. also, i think a lot of folks are expecting an entire games worth of content. and it's just not going to be anything near that.
---
Like I said.. you sound like a little bitch. Did someone steal your lead and now you’re gonna cry about it? It’s a fucking online game get over it, you’re actively letting yourself be engaged in PvP. Get good or go play in your private world with your other cuck friends.
---
The fact that Bethesda and zenimax both have rules you are supposed to follow which includes not using exploits of which these are. It's not Bethesda who is abusing the exploits its players who are so insecure about themselves they have to attempt to make other people in video games feel bad. The point of my post is that it's the players making the conscious decision to purposefully cause other players who have done nothing wrong grief because they are mad at Bethesda which makes no fucking sense.
---
I want to grab your hand and flex my bicep so hard right now.
---
They're really good at catching the average man do it, but if you earn millions they don't give a shit. 0.5% tax is fine my rich dude buddy.
---
Yes. It is the same as what i already have. But it should allow me to have more than 1. If not, then the system should be smart not to duplicate what I have
---
Yeah, no, that isn’t happening. I have 1st, a lot of other people I’ve seen have 1st, and those that don’t have it don’t attack. Most of the time they’re asking for me to stand still so they can take a look at the ranger armor. Maybe you’re just playing on servers that have a bunch of people from this subreddit, given how toxic y’all are, even though 90% of you will be back when Wastelanders drops.
---
Yeah. Whatever happened to that big update they promised where they were going to add NPCs? Guess we get an overpriced, broken subscription instead.
---
Like I said, the fact that you don’t see the hypocrisy in your statement is cringe af. Go die in a fissure, metaphorically of course.
---
Damn right, not only is it my favourite Fallout, but it’s my favourite game for sure. Got 2700 hours on record
---
20% is really low VAT? Please tell me where I can go to live where it's like 10%..
---
I strongly agree with your post BOSS\_Zombie, I have loved the Fallout series since the first game. I bought Fallout 76 primarily due to it being another Fallout game, except it finally game me the option to play with friends. With this Fallout 1st business it is blatantly obvious that the loyalty of the company is not with the people that stuck by them and continued to play Fallout 76, but rather with money. At this point I'm standing strong in not paying for Fallout 1st and I do not agree with it, however we will see what Bethesda has to say in the future about players and if they will listen to us.
---
I expect parts of Wastelanders will be paywalled, like perhaps some quests and npcs, and definitely an npc companion/packmule if they add such a thing, "members" only.
---
This exactly. Why couldn't we do this?
---
So now you're literally just insulting me over and over in multiple comments. How is it hypocritical to want the player base to stop punishing other players for something they have no real control over. At this point I can tell you are only here to troll and so I've reported you to the reddit mods.
---
The bottlecap mines and plans I got for ore ordering but update 12 I believe they removed the plans I had learned to make em and all my mines. Same or next update all my weightless mainframe cores(I had 200) and nuclear keycards(109) gained 1.5 pounds of weight each. I logged in being 900 pounds overweight going “WTF”had to drop a lot of them I grinded for so I could move
---
You've obviously never worked for a game company. Generally people work at game companies because they love the game or franchise that it represents. The developers of this do really care about the game but they don't get to make the decisions on what happens. That's entirely up to the management.
---
Haha oh boy ya. The most recent patch has claimed for the 5th time that a super annoying bug has been fixed yet again but it really hasn’t. These aren’t game breaking bugs by any means and I only experience a few somewhat frequently but the worst for me as a melee build is that probably half of my melee swings will connect but don’t take off damage. Very annoying when trying to kill mobs where you should be one shotting everything but it actually take 3-4 swings per enemy to kill it so you just get butt fucked when you should have done the butt fucking. SBQ fights always ruin my audio until I log out and come back in as well which sucks. 
---
It is a very fun and beautiful game all of those things aside. I’m just pissed about this paid service shit
---
That really is not as simple as you think. When you work years on a specific engine moving to a new one is not easy at all. Game developers also have some of the least stable jobs in general due to the nature of game development itself.
---
You have no place in an online game, this isn’t hello kitty adventure.. this is fallout, a world full of raiders and people who want to kill you. Get good or don’t put yourself in a position to PvP. You sound like someone cut you in line and you don’t know how to stand up for yourself. Grow a backbone and stop whining about being bad at this game, just pay more money and circlejerk with your private world cuck buddies.
---
And that's in a city. Live in the country you'll be lucky to get $500..
---
I’ve had this issue since day 1 of launch. If I have something hanging on my walls like lights or paintings it will never let me place my blue print house even when it’s highlighted green. Fuck this game
---
Roughly 15 USD. Ok that's pretty bad.
---
You do understand that there's literally an option to disable pvp? And that players use exploits to get around that option? And that using exploits is against the bethesda/zenimax ToS/CoC?
---
Daily cap and scrip resets are probably only for fallout first members now.
---
No, and please stop making the same post all over again.
---
War never changes
---
You could just like, I donno, use the Internet to re learn how to play the game??? There’s this thing called google that if you ask it a question it will give you the answer believe it or not. No need to waste our time and yours by crying about your own idiocy.
---
I agree but oh my LORD the bad grammar wall of text is hurting my eyes.
---
Bullshit they are.  No more or less then Adventure people are targeted by PvP people at any given time.  Look I'm unhappy with Fallout 1st but c'mon let's not cause more drama than we have to.  There's already plenty of real drama to go around.
---
Sorry😂 I’ll try to fix it, grammar isn’t my strong suit.
---
Now its just real life, we have the poor players, tge rich players, and the bragging rich players
---
orrr zenimax is just trying to squeeze some more money out of the game
---
There’s a bug where melee and guns will sometime not do any damage for what would have been a hit even if you seen blood and hear the hit marker. Super frustrating
---
The reason is that it was supposed to be a part of an upcoming comminist pack but was accidently put in too early
---
There's a ton fo exciting stuff currently in the files so keep an eye out for them
---
damn i really wanted the ranger armor, but fuck paying 13$ for it.
---
They also stated no season pass lol
---
Up until recently that wasn't a thing they could consider due to Sony not really liking cross play but they seem to have backed down on that so maybe after wastelanders
---
I wasn't a fan of the stripped down mechanics and overall dumbed down mechanics either. The settlement stuff I did like but felt it could have been done better.
---
They would have made a lot more money if they had released a game that actually worked on release.  Just saying.
---
I don't think anyone should download stuff they're not sure of their content. If you want your stuff to be seen put them on a Google doc or something
---
Not the game, it is already ruined. people who encourage unethical business practices by buying into a blatant cash grab built on lies are ruining the fallout community. Anyone paying money into this game in its current state is laying the groundwork for Bethesda to keep releasing unfinished trash-piles  filled with microtransactions and the promise of gold at the bottom.
---
I never said anything about ridiculing them but if you believe supporting this scam practice is good then I'm sorry for you.
---
There's currently some caravan stuff in both the game files and the exe so it's entirely possible we might get them
---
The chest of the armor seems to say CPD instead of LAPD, so I'm assuming it's riot armor from the Charleston police department.
---
The desert rangers were also probably already active during the timeline of 76, so it wouldn't have been impossible for the gear to have made its way to West Virginia.
---
For Australians, without GST it's $20.86
---
Updated!
---
Yeah I feel bad for people that had to work on the creative side of this game. I'm sure many of them only felt dread as it rolled closer to release date.
---
But when I say fuck Bethesda, I'm not meaning the low level employees. I mean fuck the pathetic choices made by management.
---
They intentionally lobotomised one of my favourite game franchises for short term profit. Anyone supporting this garbage by buying Fallout 1st is suffering from Stockholm syndrome.
---
That is incorrect. You are not able to take damage from other players unless either you own a workshop, have unstable isotope or electrically charged, or they set off nuke Mines or similar. The last two options are actually exploits and the use of them is against the ToS/CoC
---
I am a member. :(
---
I hope they are shouting 'scaaaaaabs' at them, or 'dey terk err jerbs' - second one is less relevant but made me laugh.
---
Am calling the police
---
I took a quick glance. Very nice list man. Too bad I'm on pc. Best of luck with trades :-)
---
&gt; Delrith, who reviewed F76 for Angry Joe, put over 200 hours into this piece of shit game. All on stream, live.
---
If what you're saying is true, then it sounds to me like this person you're talking about got their money's worth, and then some. Not only did they get 200 hours of entertainment, but they got 200 hours of stream content, as well. I mean, nobody would play a game that they don't enjoy for *200 hours*. I think we can both agree on that, right.
---
Just so you know. The act of doing this on someone who is in pacifist mode is an exploit and against the ToS/CoC.
---
So what people are just supposed to only say positive things about the game because some Devs might have a cry?
---
&lt;/applause&gt;
---
Pacifist mode is supposed to stop this. However it doesn't. People who do this to others who are in pacifist mode are using an exploit to get around that system. Use of such exploits is against the bethesda ToS/CoC and I would recommend you report those people.
---
it's too strange to me
---
Ya you should all quit. It wont matter 2 me i can afford 8$ a month. That and ill be in a server you will never get invited 2. Lmfao bye
---
They fucking ruined the community, it was fun/relaxing rebuilding Appalachia and making progress and now it's hell.
---
Thats okay. I don't want to play with you screaming Xbox kids anyway.  
---
/s
---
Its not "NCR Armor". Its pre-war riot control armor with a Trenchcoat. If you look at it, its says "CPD" (Charleston Police Department) on the chest
---
Yeah nah
---
That’s a massive waste of time. Kill and loot all the mole miners at Blackwater mine 2-3 times and you’ll have a good 2-3k steel.
---
Thank you so much that is super helpful! 😊
---
I've been having a look at nukacrypt.com/search would I be right in thinking that if the item has the keyword &lt;SURV_DiseasePrevention_Inhalation&gt; then it has the effect, or is there more to it than that?
---
Me
---
but people are already payd for fallout first... mmmh
---
Who is to say that Wastelanders will still be free for everyone?  BGS already broke their promise about all content updates being free with Fallout 1st.  How do we know that Wastelanders won't only be "free" to Fallout 1st subscribers?
---
How much would you like for the powered sent auto stim scout left arm it would complete my set.
---
It’s easy to understand, but the way I look at it is that one person will not make the difference, and that telling myself that if everyone thought that way things would be worse doesn’t make sense because it won’t change how other people choose to spend their money.
---
Personally, I've only run into nice people inside the game itself. I find stuff left by other players constantly in the suitcases and other containers at the train stations, and I drop off my excess ammo and stuff there as well. Caps prices for stuff people are selling are for the most part very reasonable. Never been attacked by anyone really either. People tend to wait to kill legendaries so anyone nearby can tag, and so on.
---
I just wish the entirety of the Fallout community, outside of the game as well, was as civilized and friendly, instead of what it actually is.
---
Oh well.
---
And now I need a price for #151. The Bloodied Meat Hook.
---
Feel like the point was that the Austin branch is in charge of 76, while the Maryland branch is in charge of all the singleplayer stuff
---
The change is welcome and that we are able to adjust the volume is absolutely cherrished.
---
Jesus thats kinda sad. I am outraged as the next person about the fallout 1st situation but there is no reason to harbor ill will towards others who wanted the service. Our anger should be at Bethesda for lying to fans. I do wonder how many of them are people actually outraged at the situation or just simply greifers that found a shiny new target.
---
Bethesda actually does pay attention to this subreddit. One of the community managers even joined the discord associated with the reddit. This sub has always been negative towards Bethesda at the first sign of anything "bad" (remember repair kits and how they were going to be the downfall of the game. Or scrap kits or the fridge and collection) I've never really found this place to be very positive in general as whenever the views of anyone are challenged like when I datamine how certain things work and I get told I'm wrong because they saw this or that then the whole thing blows up.
---
Oh they're very active on alt accounts spreading love for that amazing subscription...
---
I have never actually seen this happen. Could you explain the steps or post a video of it so I can forward it to the community managers?
---
Use nukacrypt instead. They usually have the code almost immediately
---
What money? Most players got it second hand. GameStop was just giving people copies on the way out of the door. Bethesda can't be making too much off of it.
---
Could tell when they started putting atom challenges behind walls like brewing and camera pictures. Those don't come up like they used to, but maybe people weren't throwing down cash for atoms like they'd hoped and so they made them harder to acquire.
---
 It makes sense they would want to monetize it like they do with ESO+. Even though you can make the argument "ESO is better" the game has made a lot of improvements
---
We already have such loadouts, been that way for a long time.  I doubt this will even be noticeable.  How does that affect plebs unless PVP is involved?
---
It's 20 hours after the first buy/sell of the day
---
It looks fine man. Just double space every few sentences lol. Makes it easier to read
---
you answered your own question, they're not making enough money rn someone they release a subscription service to get some extra revenue
---
Got it.
---
Not really. It's not a subscription it's a monthly private world rental fee. Literally every other game that has private servers does the same exact thing but only Bethesda gets shit on for it?
---
This roadblock will get worse and worse. At Zenimax they have very clever bastards designing monetisation. You will gradually notice more heavy important items appearing in the game. Most likely materials just to push you more and more towards subscribing. In ESO stash limit depends on number of unique items rather than weight so with every bigger update they add new unique crafting materials (which is totalky unnecessary) just to fill up your bank space and force you into subscribing for ulimited stash.
---
Also calling it now, subscribers will eventually get base budget increase (just like in eso) in a form of raw budget or some kind of basement whatever.
---
It’s not bullshit they are being singled out, fuck Bethesda and they stupid ass Fallout 1st subscription the people they just think ‘fuck it I’ll do a month’ are the reason why Bethesda think they can get away with this joke of a game, hows about fixing the game enough before bringing in more bullshit feature to make a quick buck.
---
Most of those have some spell effect associated with the actual creature that you'll end up getting the mount on the death of it. Expecting it to probably end up coming with wastelanders
---
&gt; Wastelanders better deliver (has to deliver)
---
It sounds like you might do good to manage your expectations. Personally, I'm actually enjoying 76 quite a bit. For me it was mostly exactly as advertised, barring a few missteps, which for me haven't really taken away from the game itself. Having said that, I'm not expecting Wastelanders to be some biblical second coming that will blow my mind. There will be NPCs that talk. There will be some amount of story, but nowhere near as much as there already is in the game now. What you won't see is some illusion of choice, in the form of dialogue options quest choices, nor some minor changes in how some story goes, like in many other games. There will most likely be no dialogue skill/attribute checks. There won't be followers.
---
All of that should be blatantly obvious by now, and nobody should be expecting anything more than that, and hence nobody should be disappointed.
---
But, *of course* people will be disappointed, because we live in the age of being disappointed and being offended and being angry. Still, if you honestly want to avoid that, then manage your expectations.
---
Companions will definitely be behind a paywall. The entire quest line should be free though, and that's all I care about. Love me some lore.
---
Woe be unto anyone that decides to support their favorite game.
---
It's a 25% chance per event. Stings and things, whatever the cleanup one is, and campfire tales can all award them
---
I hope it won't because if it will, Bethesda will get all excited and design the game to further push people into subscription. At this point i hope Bethesda fails at everything until they realize bow bad they fucked up and reverse it totally.
---
Try placing a single foundation then snapping that foundation to the first one?
---
Well this has aged well already.
---
The thing that people fail to understand is that scrap does not weigh nothing. This is just a different kind of container that can only hold scrap but has no weight limit.
---
they will if you pay them enough, so I doubt anyone here will have problems playing how they want
---
Because the possibility to have 5 characters is so you can do multipie play styles without having to delete your character, not forcing one character to be junk holder.
---
$130 a year in canada. :p
---
8.33/month is not cheap considering
---
RUN THEY ARE COMING I COVER YOU
---
This entire game is gonna be the new world of Warcraft blood plague. Down the road people will research class struggle and google will bring up fallout 1st players get slaughtered by everyone else
---
You do realize they're saying it has all the good qualities both games share(or FO76 tries to) and none of the bad.
---
Ok and please leave this sub too instead of joining the circle jerk snivelling
---
Yes, I had 2 drops and 4 scorch beast following me around. So many 'thuds' were heard this day.
---
That's sad to hear, Bethesda seemed to have split up the community in a bad way.
---
Lets not forget about the enclave
---
(Xbox player) an interesting thought! Never considered that difference. I imagine thatd be much more convenient, but the scroll wheel never did bother me too much. Itd be much worse if stimpacks were on it, but since they're not I actually think I prefer the wheel. With that said, I dont change weapons a ton. Idk what kind of space itd take up, but an option to change wheel and fo4 style would be a sweet addition
---
Depends how many realized that with the whaling model they would have to produce negative value to out weigh the paying minority and get attention
---
Responders?
---
Hey Mom! I found one in the wild! He actually LIKES fallout 76 hahahahah
---
How can any of you support this game still?
---
Strange, not a problem I've had. Be sure the door has no other wires going to it. Also try disconnecting it entirely to experiment a bit. Lastly try and close out your game and restart. Entirely possible it's just bugged out.
---
Yet you are still here...
---
Sure thing, princess.
---
We must play different games and read different subs then. And your Bethesda must be different than everyone else's Bethesda too, because yours seems to be perfect.
---
Stop saying it's not the people who bought subscription. It's like saying (sorry for more serious tone here) people who buy drugs are not responsible for the success of drug traffickers in any way. If it doesn't sell, it will fall. By supporting the scam that this subscription and it's game is you are funding the future for more of the same or worse practice. And don't give me crap that this is not a scam. They've lied, multiple times and they've purposely designed parts of the game to pretty much force you into subscribing. This game had so much false advertising it's not even funny.
---
I am the 'princess' here? Ok xD
---
EAT THE WHALES
---
No I just have more info on what's going on than a lot of other people due to being a dataminer and bug/exploit reporter as well as a reverse engineer, programmer, and mod author.
---
Except that opens up the possibility that they're either not incompetent or not lying :^)
---
If it was only that I would totally agree with you. Add in the p2w element and the double crossing over scrap / inventory capacity and I'm done. Not judging anyone who wants to keep playing or pay for it, people will do what they enjoy and I have no say in that, but for me zenimax have gone too far now. 
---
It's a shame as I really did like the game and encouraged friends to buy it when they were being put off by the media.
---
Is not a new bug, had the aid drop one ages ago, and recently scorchbeasts...
---
Anyone else also have the weapon bug return on the favourites wheel? Where if you have two weapons of the same type, one is removed each new load into game.... that’s come back with the last update.
---
Its hilarious you guys are even playing the game bethesda says thanks for the cash for a halfmade fallout.
---
That's a yikes to me chief. It shouldn't matter if they bought Fallour 1st or not... they are still people just trying to enjoy the game
---
I feel you! 🙏🏻
---
For now with the private worlds being the same as regular ones there's no issue with character crossover, however as soon as they add things to the private worlds that changes that you won't be able to take your characters back and forth the same way. There's no way they could make that work. The thing about the scrap box is that it's an entirely seperate inventory than your regular one or your stash so they can handle it a different way but not in a way that would make sense if every person in the game had it. You have your own opinions on it and your own definition of what p2w is and so does Bethesda. They actually stated that they would not put anything in the atom shop that gives a competitive advantage and they haven't.
---
Someone should uninstall you ffs.
---
Gotta pay atoms for every change you make.
---
I'd absolutely reccomend it if, and only if, you guys are into the fallout universe. Being a huge fallout fan, the game was absolutely amazing. I loved exploring a new wasteland all over again. And it really is great at the start. Itll get boring later on, and if you dont care about the fallout world then that bore will set in far far faster. It's not too expensive atm (typically around $20 I think) which is a fair price. Bugs are there, but despite how "game breaking" people say they are, I've never had anything too bad. So again, if you're a fallout fan then I reccomend it! If you're new or dont care much about the fallout world.. give it a few months
---
Or they just want to enjoy the game in spite of the bullshit Bethesda are pulling?
---
Comparing the games Devs and owners to drug dealers? Ok, let's run with that.
---
Fallout 76 is some super addictive crack, hundreds of thousands have died from overdosing on it, and Pete and Todd are kicking down my door as we speak, screaming ' Where's my Money!'
---
Ridiculous comparison to make.
---
I only really listen to the radio stations, and they're absolutely awesome. Some very amazing songs on Appalachia radio and the classical station is by far the best yet. Tho I am a bit biased, as one of my favorite songs is on there and that really sells it for me
---
Yeah fair enough. I didn't particularly mean p2w in a PvP way, more that people who have enough disposable income can make the game significantly less frustrating for themselves. Which to me basically says they deliberately made it a pain in the dick unless you pay them.. classic candy crush saga tactics.
---
You clearly did not understand the issue. I am just trying to say that the help articles in-game should be readable from the main menu. That's all.
---
Material on the www depends on some people volunteering and making their own (or some websites making material trying to earn money). I want to read the in-game articles.
---
I have read these (and can find) www-materials when I was playing the game, but they are not a good reason to disable in-game manual when not in a server.
---
You are attacking me instead of the the party that made this decision. It's not a big or medium level issue, but even a small nuisance can be discussed. What if FIFA or PES would let players only view help pages and button commands WHILE IN A GAME THAT CAN NOT BE PAUSED and the enemy is racking up goals while you try to learn. And then if you read too much, you will be kicked from the server and help pages because you were idle too long.
---
It's more related to Fallout than FO76, that's indisputable.
---
I get that. Part of the thing that I think will end up happening is that Bethesda will use the scrap boxes for 1st only members as a test and eventually give them out. Then give 1st members something else. It's not a bad idea in general.
---
Side note: Bethesda has stated in multiple interviews that the money that they get from atom shop sales goes to the development of future dlc and due to that the future dlc will remain free. People seem to forget this part.
---
No loss. Sycophantic losers need to be punished for actively diminishing the value of gaming for everyone else.
---
LMAOOOO this aged well. Yeah, new vegas isn’t overrated and the outer worlds is just as amazing as we knew it would be. Stay mad 🥴
---
Not really though. It's their fault for buying overpriced bad stuff and thus fueling their respective system.
---
Yeah you were wrong, it’s open world.
---
... I'm aware? [That's what the 4Head is for?](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/4head)
---
Ah fair enough. I'm bad with memes I'm sorry
---
Oh they're fine. They're here, posting subversive shit in support of FO76 and the scumbaggery of Bethesda, only under alts.
---
Astroturfing is their actual job.
---
lmao were you munching on paste as you typed that up?
---
It's not an apology if it doesn't cost them something
---
I see the astroturfing is in full swing. Try harder, Bethesda PR person.
---
Ouch, that's rough. Well if you ever do happen to see something in the atom shop that you cant live without, maybe itd be worth a 1 month go. That's kinda my plan. If I ever happen to want atoms then I'll try it
---
I'm baffled that you're receiving downvotes as if the game has *not* full of bugs throughout its entire history.
---
So don't opt in and let the firsters support the game so it gets better for everybody. And fill out a feedback report and specifically mention things you think are wrong with firsting. Anonymously complaining doesn't do anything for the game at all
---
If you love the game, you're deranged.
---
I can't quite tell if you agree with me, honestly. Like... You realize that the people who bought 1 month of 1st aren't the problem, right? It's *LITERALLY* the system that encourages and enable Bethesda to engage in shitty business practices that are the problem, you know?
---
You might want to take a look at this post.

---
Breaking promises is worse than simply letting the game fail and packing up
---
I thought the same.....but then again, it's only worth 1 month, after that the price just isn't worth it.
---
There's actually other collection types coming down the line that have different options for what they collect
---
Nah you're alright! I don't expect *everyone* to understand Twitch memes outside of Twitch. That was why I linked the KYM page
---
It won't. Beth hasn't delivered this whole time why would you expect them to suddenly start delivering?
---
How about play the game if you want, and don't if you don't, and whatever else happens it's up to the individual? 
---
Looks like more and more of the population have become jaded assholes as they stopped playing.
---
It's the skyrim dragon all over again.
---
FONV
---
The only thing still kinda getting me is that scrap box. Everyone wants it and we certainly dont wanna pay for it.. saving like 400lb of storage would be insane. The other thing that hurt was how the marketed it and said everything, as if it was exactly how people wanted it. The atoms should've been a way bigger selling point in all this. 
---
Anyways, didnt mean to crap on your post, I actually do agree in many ways. The atoms alone are a great value especially with everything else. And I have full faith wastelanders will be free along with any other dlc
---
Had paused for a few months, this is new to me.
---
How old does a account need to be to be real in your eyes?
---
Wow, this was a very successful karma post.
---
&gt;There are people who defiantly care at Bethesda even if people want to think otherwise
---
Dwaah that's sweet
---
&gt;Todd Howard said 
---
Whoa whoa I'm gonna have to stop you there buddy I thought we were talking people who care not lying asswipes.
---
I think I might've just thrown away a red outfit... *slowly realizes horrible mistakes*
---
Nah but I dont care all that much for things for their rarity. I'm just here to look and feel cool. Asylum gear does not quite give me that feeling
---
Dis you checked if your account with psn is set as principal in the pq4 settings?
---
Huh, different people like different things? , weird.
---
Not ridiculous.  The consumers are at fault for the state of Fallout 76.  They bought it and disregarded all the bad reviews.  They bought all the mtx from the atomic shop.  They bought the subscription adding to the problem.  If the game would have been a commercial failure, we wouldn't even be talking about a subscription service, because it would have never reached that stage.  
---
Just take Breakpoint, for example.  That game shit the bed so bad in sales that Ubisoft came out and said the have to rethink their games and delayed a couple to rework them.
---
Honestly the Savage Divide music is just 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
---
You're paying a monthly fee for a private server just like hundreds of other games out there. Not entirely sure what in that is a game utility that you need? If you don't want to pay for it (the bundle for the atoms alone is worth it) then you don't have to. Abstaining from the game is only going to have you miss things like the Halloween event that's coming up this week.
---
I dont think it should live on as long as most want it to. But I do think we should get a couple more big dlc and some of these ridiculous bugs out. Keeping at this for too much longer is a waste of time and money. Giving up now would be the biggest FU to the fans yet. The game still feels a little unfinished. They just needa finish making it feel finished.
---
Karma is meaningless who gives a fuck
---
If you crouch whne reloading it doesn't cause any issues
---
Your view on promises shouldn't be the reason everyone else does not play.
---
Agreed, I was just curious cos I was selling crap in my inventory, lol.
---
its not funny and it is stupid. Well ,maybe it was funny   30 years ago  (my dad told me back in 90s  it was a thing )
---
Hahaha! Well deserved! 
---
You paid for the post apocalyptic premium, prepare to be mobbed!
---
Also if you've logged in as another user or guest?
---
Don't mind me in my Ranger Armour 😎
---
There was never going to be any free private worlds. If you want a private server you have to pay. That's what the subscription actually is for. Every other game that has private servers either has an open source one (never gonna happen here) or has hosted ones. Its simply a monthly/yearly fee for a hosted private server with other benefits tacked on like the atoms for example.
---
Fully disagreed, getting rid of this annoying chunk of weight play has finally allowed me to enjoy the damn world and explore, rather than constantly being anxious about preparing for hauls.
---
Yes my main is Set to be Primary
---
So you'd rather have wastelanders be broken and untested? Wastelanders itself is being worked on by a seperate team at Bethesda than the rest just like how nw was developed.
---
Provided they keep their wors the reason should be economical. If the game isn't sustainable as advertised they have two choices. Take the financial hit for goodwill keeping the game online despite being in the red, or shut it down for being too costly to maintain.
---
To break their promises for any reason means we will never trust what they say about their next game.
---
Take down the bourgeoisie
---
In game, we are generally very pleasant as a community. Online forums are another story.
---
I  login like a user on both a think
---
I'm sure the CMs are just as outraged as everyone else at Fallout 1st, and that they feel lied to.
---
The Outer Worlds is pretty shiny too. He could play that...
---
Should take a look at this. Your view of content and the view of content from the game developers side are 2 totally different things.
---
NV
---
A lot of these neg posters don't even play the game, man. I bought first and I enjoy the perks. It's hardly p2w, the tent doesn't even have a workbench to scrap at. Just a lot of people upset they're being a package with benefits for a little more money, and then a bunch of astroturfers
---
They are obviously in need of money. "But Bethesda has so much money already" well, yes but the project is going to have to be self sustaining PLUS create a profit in order for a business to keep the service running.
---
Wastelanders isn't free, or any update for that matter. Voice actors, dialogue, story, design, programmers, everthing is quite expensive.
---
the only thing you must reevaluate is the value you are getting from that scam
---
Fallout 1984
---
It happened to me last winter. I was staggered by a Grafton Monster while reviving a pal, and all my controls converted to a companion mode for him. Go here, pick that up, inspect the super mutant, etc. Relogging fixed it, but I guess you’re SOL inside a raid.
---
&gt;Maybe I'm being paranoid,
---
No, that is how it always works. Once a game starts with DLC, they add more and more. This is because the **price of entry goes up after DLC,** and all new players stop joining
---
&gt;Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny...
---
 ^ some green dude
---
They probably won't lock away dungeons and shit but coolest stuff will probably be locked away yeah
---
...I get the issues people have with it, it's the "Bethesda as Drug Pushers" comparison that's ridiculous.
---
We'll be doing a South Park next, "Pete Hines raped Fallout!"
---
I understand people are angry, but if people make comparisons like that, then the facts get ignored in favour of hurling insults.
---
horse armor started that, who's laughing now
---
**SMACK**
---
I bought and played the game for a couple weeks during launch, then stopped to wait for it to improve. Nothing ever drew me back for more than a few hours, so I've basically quit.
---
But I respected this sub for being equal parts critical and appreciative of what the game did well. And to see a large amount of people who want everyone to turn on it entirely is disappointing. 
---
First is a bad deal, by a greedy company trying to make a buck off of whales. That's a fact. But Fallout 76 itself is still just a game people want to play.
---
Aye it’s been much longer. I clear caps and scrip in the morning every day and it’s 5:40 pm now.
---
lol you supported and continue to support a genuine scam
---
I don't think tents do take precedence. I had one near whitesprings &amp; when I joined a public world the tent couldn't be placed due to a camp.
---
I wonder if you can buy it, redeem the outfit then request a refund to keep the outfit
---
That could be a clever loophole, stop bethesda profiting from shitty business practices and still get the outfit you want
---
I agree with you, I bought it for a month even after all the shit just to see what it's like and tbh it could've been better, Stash and Tent should've been free maybe the outfit as well but with 1st you get free outfits with the subscription per month same with the Atoms 
---
I also still say the 1st month should've been free for everyone
---
They got my sub, and before this I'd only bought one atom bundle for ten bucks so I'm hardly a whale lol. I don't want people to turn on it. The game needs support to truly improve
---
Real life people in a pretend virtual world in which you can block people you don’t get along with, report them and also just jump back into your own private world - chill out dude.
---
There was a time during the flatwoods map that the mothman fog machine was able to be placed though. Was shortly patched after that. Was only able to place one, and even then we were better off just going out to fight without it
---
Hmm interesting. I haven't seen that happen before. I'd suggest if it's still happening by the 48 hour mark please send me a pm and I'll see if I can get you in touch with a community manager to figure out what's going on.
---
On a side note sometimes vendor bots show as having no caps. Usually a server change fixes it but with what you said with scrip as well I'm guessing that won't help.
---
Two completely different mediums that do not correlate with each other in terms of value. People judge game prices in comparison to games, not in comparison to food, alcohol, tobacco, etc.
---
True
---
Need a tissue? I hope 1st sorts out blubberers like you. 
---
They didn't take anything from me, just offer new things. (And iff they'd waited for wastelanders, we'd had to wait till q1 2020 for both. Step by step, they decide what next, it's a company, not a direct democracy)
---
Please leave this sub, you and the other crybabies make it a shame for humankind currently.
---
FO2
---
What country are u in?
---
Pretty sure you’ve misunderstood
---
America.. so I guess I'm getting a way better deal? Very odd situation
---
The game has support, it's Bethesda's job to support it, and the entire point of the game was to be a live service.
---
But their support has been poorly handled, and they think the best idea to boost revenue is a subscription that doesn't even provide what is advertised.
---
You're paying for snake oil, you should be ashamed of yourself. 
---
What the game needs is Bethesda to improve it properly, not hold essential features hostage behind paywalls. This isn't an MMO, this isnt F2P. It's a full priced game that was sold into beta and is still unstable in places.
---
Oh alright my bad. It's been kind of a long day! Haha
---
It's not the fault of the developers. It's the fault of a money hungry publisher.
---
Correction: The studio that works in mainline Bethesda games like Fallout 4 and Skyrim was not the studio that worked on FO76.
---
Inon Zur always does a knockout job on the soundtrack
---
Essential features? There aren't any essential features my guy. Besides, they've been improving the game for a year. They had to push back Wastelanders anyway, check in on the game then
---
Been along week for me bro considering work and Fallout 76 among other things lol
---
Yeah they turned this game more into Sims rather than a survival.
---
Didn't even have to be with the Desert Rangers, the connection to law enforcement and military use was more than enough basis in canon.
---
I hate to say what I am going to say as someone who loves gaming, but at some point the company does have to make money from the game. They are going about it in a bad way, but as an example.
---
GTA 5 has no subscriptions, and has been running for a decade? It has massive DLC added all the time and you can play it all for free.
---
The trade off is people can buy the in game currency.
---
I think Bethesda set themselves up by saying no "pay to win" 
---
Because at some point they need a revenue stream from the game.
---
They should either, have fair prices for the atom shop stuff but make it so you can buy loads of Camp building stuff at reasonable prices.
---
Or they kind of need subscriptions.
---
Launch was a disaster for Fallout 76 but they have improved a lot of the bugs it shipped with. Streamers needing content did a good hatchet job on it too limiting the playerbase. There does have to be some money coming in to keep the servers running, wages paid and in profit.
---
Lucky for you it’s $189 here
---
They rose up.
---
You should be against griefing because it’s grieffing! At the very least because it’s only going to cause Bethesda to do something to punish the grifters or make 1st just more op to compensate.
---
And they want 15€ (16.62usd) for 1 month or 120€ (132.97usd) for a year here in Germany :(
---
That's the only bitter point for me regarding 1st :/ otherwise I'm fine with it
---
Take the 20% VAT off of the UK price as the gap is $6-7......that gap is likely due to currency exchange rate fluctuations and  Bethesda aiming for a £xx.99 price point
---
HAHAHAHA I Just love how Bethesda's attempt at publicly glorifying spending so much money  is backfiring  so badly
---
And?
---
It doesn't matter who they are. Anybody can grief anybody. It doesn't matter who's being griefed. The community has found a group they don't like and are doing what they have very right to do.
---
Suck it up.
---
It cost money to turn your communist money into real money. /s
---
US prices are shown without tax. UK prices include it at 20%. 
---
So you have to add tax to the US cost, and dependent upon where you live (I believe sales taxes can change from state to state?) it will probably be around £100 worth of dollars, give or take $5.
---
Using fake accounts to generate positive hype is not a "conspiracy theory". It's something that happens in all layers of society. Last year a major political party in my country got caught buying 100.000 likes and comments for their social media from an Indian company, essentially in an effort to sway the elections. Same thing with twitch streamers, youtubers and in this case game devs. You can't trust social media anymore. Paid shills are everywhere, it's a booming business.
---
Aye I tried buying from a vendor to update but it was still only at a few caps. I’m mostly annoyed at not being able to sell for scrip, I have way too much weight in legendaries.
---
I picked it up, and it totally changed the game for me, mostly for the better.
---
I still haven’t made the outfit, the atoms are still in my account and I used the tent once.
---
The weightless scrap is a huge benefit. I’ve always been frugal and kept junk limited to just what I need to get out of a situation where my camp is leveled, and having 1000 aluminum or cork really changes things. All my excess legendary armor is now ultralight modded and my stash is at 475. It should be a feature for everyone.
---
The private world is amazing. Having no competition during legendary-heavy events creates a leisurely atmosphere, and I can do everything on my own schedule. I can shoot at full power and not need to carry an extra underpowered pipe rifle with explosive bullets to tag enemies.  If I need to kill roaches in toxic valley or gulpers at the lagoon, I never have to worry that someone wiped them all out. All the enemies are alive when I want to farm West Tek. The best part is when I come back to camp and MY FRONT DOOR IS CLOSED! It’s a lot more like the classic solo experience, and I’ve only spent about an hour in public servers since Wednesday, mainly seeing if there were ridiculous god gear blowouts due to people rage quitting. There were a couple, and I don’t have to worry about getting a full vanguard/sentinel suit anymore.
---
Don't blame Bethesda, these children are showing their true nature. Guess most are 12 or 13 &amp; don't quite understand right from wrong yet. As no adult who isn't trailer trash would act like this.
---
Is funny to me that dupers never got as much crap from these kids as we are for purchasing something in game.
---
Probably because, all of them probably benefited from duping so they never stood up to it. Now that is something that was ruining the game. Now the only thing ruining it is the children throwing their tantrums because it didn't go their way. Welcome to life.
---
Guess what morons, I'm benefiting from fallout 1st are you?
---
They do not have the right to use exploits like nuke Mines and nuka nades to kill me when I'm in pacifist mode and do not own a workshop. That's not only a shitty thing to do but it's actively using exploits to circumvent a system which is against the ToS/CoC
---
The ability to play alone/offline/in a private server is essential to any online title, especially if it's not a PvP experience. Private servers have been a given for decades on PC, and now, when literally the biggest thing everyone wanted was private servers, Bethesda sell them, and they're not even real private servers.
---
There is no valid reason Fallout 76 had not to ship with an online mode. There is not a single feature of the game that cannot be handled identically offline in a solo mode. 
---
And fixing, or improving in any way shape or form the absolutely insane situation with loot storage is absolutely essential. The biggest core issue of the game has always been punishing players for efficiently looting and stockpiling said loot. The issue itself being caused by the online nature of the title, and Bethesda being unable or unwilling to fix it. 
---
Except to sell a workaround for what is probably the most important aspect of looting. Crafting junk. 
---
Essential. 
---
If their improvements were not fixing the poor loot storage, lack of private servers, and mod support, that is on them. The fact that anyone can defend this travesty is insane. Your standards are objectively poor. You have become indoctrinated by the greed of todays gaming industry. You expect and accept shit with a smile on your face. 
---
Meanwhile fucking Ark lets you host a private server for free. And the devs of Ark sold a DLC while in Early Access.
---
I have 4 accounts. I know your pain friend
---
Whoever bought that scam subscription deserves to get griefed...
---
Don't care.
---
This is the best fucking praxis I've seen all day.
---
Noticed this reply just now, thanks!
---
Did you find out when the scale stops dropping ?
---
I wonder if we can get disease immunity by endurance alone.
---
Do you keep the armour even after the subscription runs out?
---
Guess its not cool to divide players into first and second tier.
---
I'm on PC, I usually carry 3 weapons on me, plus stimpacks, water, and dog food. It's super easy to spam these when needed on PC. 
---
From what I've read too, this game works a helluva lot better on PC.
---
So you have no problem with using exploits to kill people in pacifist mode? If so then you do know that your account can easily be reported for doing those actions?
---

They don't have to show the final price you have to pay in the US? Thanks for clearing this up. At least for B2C it's by law here in Germany.
---
Or do you have to pay the taxes later on your own? How much you have to pay with taxes?
---
Don't care motherfucker.
---
Maxes out at 15 endurance unfortunately.
---
Private worlds being pre-looted has already been de-bunked as a continuation of game state from Adventure mode.
---
Don't think I do, in my case someone else's camp took precedence &amp; my tent was removed
---
And now you're blocked and reported to the reddit moderators. Have a wonderful day
---
Uh, OK.
---
Go ahead and target me.  The worst thing you can do is buy out my vendor.  And if I need to, I'll spend the next year in my private server. 💵💰💵
---
Is there any way to see the number of active players at any one time? Those stats would make very Interresting reading.
---
It's like 99% of this sub don't know how consumption tax works.
---
Oh I'm certainly not buying into their money pitfall trap, but why would it be anyone else's descision to control what they do with THEIR money. Idk dude it's like beating up someone for wearing bad clothes or overpriced shoes.
---
&gt;In Fallout 1 it’s about stopping the master from turning everyone into super mutants or killing them
---
And it just so happens that that game was made first. If J K Rowling wrote Order of the Phoenix before Prisoner of Azkaban you wouldn't read through book 3 wondering 'oh boy I hope Sirius gets out of this ok'.
---
&gt;In 2 and 3 it’s about stopping the enclave from rising to power once again and subjugating or killing everyone they come across
---
Again. Chronology = game order.
---
&gt;Every other game has a larger threat, however the scorched is the first one to transcend all biological barriers and threaten all life, not just the lives of humans
---
It's also the first one to suddenly, out of the blue, be a retroactive threat with no justification for being 'completely forgotten'. It did happen, but no one remembers, there were no consequences, and everything else happened just the same as it was always expected to happen. So what exactly is the buy-in for this story?
---
&gt;Why watch a horror movie? You know the last survivor will kill the killer
---
Do you? Texas Chainsaw Massacre
---
&gt;Why read/watch some war media? You know the people you’re following are gonna live
---
Do you? And besides, this has the different aspect of telling an *internal* story. You know the beginning, you know the end, but the focus is on the interactions and events between the two. Fallout 76 doesn't have this because everything already happened, or happens at the end. What is the internal story? 'Everyone was dead when I woke up and then I killed the Scorched'.
---
&gt;Why play an RPG? You know you’ll kill the villain in the end
---
Do you? KotOR.
---
You mean the fact that there was literally maybe 3 total survival servers running at any one time? No one played the game mode so they got rid of it.
---
Nah, think that's fear mongering tbh. I'm not shilling, I think Bethesda and fallout 76 are objectively dog shit but that's a romise they'll abide by.
---
Wha- why did you buy it in the first place? There was nothing subtle about the feature being anything but P2W.
---
It really is not far-fetched, I agree.
---
https://youtu.be/qX59OmFPM1U
---
So you get to keep the armour after the subscription runs out?
---
Stockholm syndrome man, don't bother.
---
&gt;chill out dude.
---
Me chill out? Have you read some of the bible crap that's been written here? Have you see the videos of the shit that's been happening on the servers? Yeah, real people, really getting harrassed,  abused and bullied. 
---
Sorry, I'm not the one that needs to chill out, these vicious, amoral bullying punks are the ones that need to chill out. For myself, I dont give a rat's ass, I can take it laugh it off. Better yet if one of these morons tries to PVP with me they have a bit of a surprise,  but you and I both know a large portion of gamers, even more so FO gamers, are fragile and reclusive by nature. Females and alts also get particularly nasty attacks. But it's just a game, right?
---
It would be ok like if in any other survival sandbox we could just buy a server from a provider, and it being permanent...
---
I know people hate to be responsible for anything and I'll be downvoted for sure but people that keep giving money to companies regardless of what they do is why many "AAA" games have are in such terrible condition, because why make a quality product when you still getting money  for it regardless of it's condition  and problems
---
Pretty sure your paying for 30 days of 1st from whenever you purchase it so for example if you buy it today you get 27th Oct to 27th Nov I'm sure other will confirm.
---
This, with some visual ques from bioshock thrown in.
---
They have been lying even before the release... not sure why you are surprised.
---
Bethesda are a bunch of incompetent liars, they can't even test their own shit they produce.
---
Most states charge different amounts of sales tax so if you did quote a price including tax you would end up quoting different prices to most people....
---
...even if you did though US sales tax is nothing like 20%, it’s between 0% and 13% with a median around 6-7%. This doesn’t make our 20% unfair though as governments still need the money and they may just get it in different ways. 
---
Typically the US and UK are similar on income tax (Germany / France have higher income taxes) - the US hammers people with property taxes though compared to Europe.
---
Your tent wasn't loaded* OP is talking about if you're already in game and have your tent placed where his camp is, then Bethesda should remove your tent.
---
Can you read with understanding? I apologised for more serious comparison but it's the first thing that came to my mind. Stop trying to play smartass mate. My point still stands. If you support scam, the scam will thrive. Simple as that. If you can't grasp it I can't help you.
---
Imagine this.  Porting first then going through your menus.  This is group gaming 101 right here dude!
---
"You ah came to the wrong ah picanic boyo!"
---
Because the problem isn't that Bethesda broke any promises. People made expectations that were not correct. Bethesda never actually said cosmetic only items in the atom shop. The only mention was on a tweet in response to someone asking if they would be able to buy a legendary mini gun on the atom shop. The scenario is pretty specific.
---
As for all content being free they've actually stated as to what they mean by content in those interviews. A private server rental using a subscription service is not a battle pass. They continue to give us free dlc and in one of the early interviews even said that the money from the atom shop goes to funding free dlc in the future.
---
Everyone forgets to read the whole thing and either takes the info from someone else who already has a bias or takes things out of context
---
Hahahahaa whatever man. Be sad about it, be angry about it, doesn't matter to me at all. Some people like it. Get over it
---
The idea that 'any publicity is good publicity' has no basis in reality. None.
---
&gt; i dont do it to pay to win an online game i do it to actually make it the single player game i wanted it to be
---
You know there are single player experiences that don't cost $150+?
---
I'm gonna ignore the insults because you seem like kind of an entitled person and I don't want you to feel entitled to insults from me lol. If they sold a dlc in early access why didn't they add it to the base game? Or were you saying that was a bad thing and they still got private servers right?
---
Oh so "internet badasses" are ganging up on people who paid to enjoy the game? Real mature...bet they're all 13 year olds or 50+ year olds living in their moms basement. People need to get a fucking life and quit being little bitches.
---
The unfinished "Communist Salute" emote was tested in the patch build and erroneously pushed live.  
---
A reasonable company would acknowledge this mistake by making the completed emote the "free gift" during the debut week of the Communist atom shop bundle.
---
It's a full 30 days after you purchase it.
---
I’ve added you - stonejaguar24 :)
---
It's not practical to have paid expansions on an online game. It would cause problems of non paid and paid loading into the same server.
---
Yes you are paying for 3 days only
---
\^ This.
---
What they CAN and probably will do is send that dude a cease and desist-letter, telling him to remove the fallout logos etc. They cant just grab the domain, but they do own that logo and those illustrations, and can sue his ass if he does not comply (or more likely - have the webhost take the site down)
---
"We hold the line here" is my go to for gettin shit done tune.
---
The mutation itself has to proc which can happen from melee attack even if you are in pacifist. When this happen you take some damage and the person takes some as well.
---
You realize that if they don't actively seeking to shut down the private servers, they stand to lose the rights to the game don't you? The way the US system works would allow for that, you have to make good faith efforts to defend your IP. Now granted blizzards actions of late prove that as a company they are despicable, but shutting down private servers is not a point against them, it's them protecting their rights to their own game.
---
Let them hide in their "private worlds"
---
Quick search on ps4 forums "try to delete the second profile (the one without psn) and relog it. Settings &gt; Loggin Settings &gt; Manage Accounts".
---
You buy a month, not this month. It will run out on the same date next month. I don't think any services are for a calendar month, but I could be wrong.
---
The biggest issue In my mind is is that the legal theater tends to view digital customer complaints  as so much chaff in the wind. 
---
Removing the digital aspect. We paid for a product that was incomplete by its sale definition. Similar to buying a condo before construction is complete. Hell, some buildings are sold out before ground is broken.  We paid for the incomplete product with the promise the product would continue to be worked upon and new features added as time goes. You don't pay the property developer when they excavate, nor when they frame, nor when they hook up utility connections. You paid for the product to be finished. 
---
We paid for an incomplete product. They are now demanding additional funding to continue working on the project. To compare to the condo developer again, if the developer cannot fund the development, the payment from the customer is returned. Usually through a banking institution because we're talking hundreds of thousands if not millions. 
---
In my mind, for Bethesda to make this right, they need to put the unlimited scrap box as a patch improvement, and they should give players with a confirmed beta account the first year. We tested this game for them. I feel at the very least we should be compensated for our time. 
---
Again, if they lock wastelanders behind this subscription, they blatantly reneged upon their marketing and promises. Locking new content behind a paywall is the fastest way to alienate consistent players.
---
Maybe I should buy a copy on sale and do the same. But that means supporting Bethesda so maybe not.
---
It doesn't spawn in the locked explosives crates
---
Yes, lied and put the best QoL content behind a pay wall.
---
Sounds like a paid review, try again bot.
---
This is what happens with corporativism.
---
Still, there's something i don't get. Your main is the account you buyed psn on. And it is the one that can't go online oÔ how it is on another games with your main ? Did you checked your psn subscription?
---
I use EBay. Every now and then they'll give you vouchers. I found a unopened copy for £5, £2.50 postage. I used a free £10 voucher to pay for it.
---
Tragic
---
&gt;Believing even with delays it's not going to have major issues.
---
Agreed. They should have gotten better at climbing, before they started putting those walls up...in a lot of frustrating places!
---
Ty man it worked.. I got it to work
---
"JuSt StOp PlAyInG tHe GaMe YoU aLrEaDy bOuGhT."
---
Galaxy brain take there. There's zero hypocrisy involved in enjoying the game and want it to be improved while hating Bethesda's shitty decisions. How else is anything going to change if Bethesda isn't faced with negative backlash. Wanting people to either quit the game or stop criticizing 1st is just you being a fanboy, I'm afraid.
---
Exactly what I’ve done. I’m not sure I’ll bother keeping it but if I do I don’t expect to get other players targeting me for my decision. At the end of the day it’s my choice to pay for it, the same as it’s their choice not to pay for it. That behaviour is bs. Having said that so far so good, no griefers...yet
---
Single action revolvers are primarily museum pieces due to their antiquated reload method, Bloodied/Explosive or otherwise.  
---
If you insist on using a civil war relic as your primary means of defense, consider getting 3 ranks of the luck perk "Quick Hands" to reduce the time you spend stuffing rounds into the cylinder by 18%.
---
The price is fine, it's actually on the low end of subscription fees as a whole. The timing is terrible. I'm 95% sure that the decision to push out the subscription without Wastelanders came from Providence, and investment firm that owns roughly half of Betheada right now. They have just shy of $1 million invested in the private company. People think corporations are bad? Try a private company that owes a firm money. They will stop at nothing to squeeze out revenue. Atleast a corporation is obligated to maintain PR for their shareholder's sake. I wouldn't be surprised if we see a total takeover soon, and then an IPO within the next couple of years. Most likely immediately after TES VI.
---
It won't be locked behind a pay wall everyone knows that already. You mean you should be compensated for playing an optional beta that you paid nothing extra to do in the first place? Some of the people who play (me included) actively hunt down bugs and exploits just to report them to Bethesda. We get nothing extra out of it. Hell we even inform the community about things quite often. Playing the beta was something you were not obligated to do just as me and my group are not obligated to do the datamining and bug / exploit finding that we do
---
&gt;It's not about whether or not I want to buy it. EVERYONE needs to refrain from buying it
---
LMAO. When you do my job then you can tell me how to spend my money. The nerve of you self righteous crusaders...who the hell appointment you as the gaming Gestapo?
---
So what’s the solution?
---
What is your definition of a force close btw?
---
Yeah, who gives a shit tho?
---
Depends on the luck of the draw, if it's heavily downvoted it continues to be downvoted. There're both sides using this subreddit
---
How many of them are though? Perhaps RUST, but e.g. DayZ and Scum only has a very niche audience. And very few of them are with few bugs. Also, any of these games compares better to fo76 than Outer Worlds, and even to earlier Fallout games.
---
What’s more deranged? Enjoying the game or wasting your time and energy ragging on it. Dick.head.
---
A hobby like playing video games?
---
&gt;No, in most definitely doesnt. More content will get locked behind paywalls
---
At this point, because of shrill Gestapo wannabes like you, I hope more does go only to FO1st.
---
I’m enjoying the benefits of 1st too man! Now hoarding so much junk I don’t know what to do with, and freed stash space to keep all my weapons in. 
---
Hoping an ammo box comes out soon for FO1st so I can enjoy that as well :)
---
Best benefit is the nice cap flow selling off huge excess of valuable junk to all the grieving players against the 1st members
---
I met one of the elite rangers today, cool dude, was one-shotting the horde boss on a public server.
---
No, you take those insults. You deserve them.
---
And calling people entitled these days doesn't mean anything. It's a buzzword people throw around whenever gamers are unhappy with being treated like shit by devs and publishers. 
---
We are absolutely entitled to good quality, consistent support, and basic features games have been delivering us for over twenty years. Yet whenever a community expresses distaste for a lack of the three, people like you come out of the woodwork with suspiciously brown noses to call them entitled. 
---
Ark sold DLC in early access because apparently they were low on funds, owing to a lawsuit settlement. Which I disagree with, as an early access title, any content created during development should have gone into the game itself, and if funds were so low, they should have sought out literally any other source of additional income, rather than invalidating their own business model.
---
Private Servers were in from initial launch, they were expected, and server politics are one of the biggest draws of Ark. Similiar to Rust.
---
That the Ark devs lacked the integrity to maintain early access expectations, yet still had a basic, universal feature of an online title shows how out of touch Bethesda is. They alienated a large portion of their potential playerbase by refuses to provide an expected feature, and now that we have the option, it's worse than every implementation in the past.
---
I remember one time I was at this guys CAMP and he had a siren with a sign next to it that read "When the siren is on that means Im logging off in 2 minutes". I think thats a pretty good way to solve that particular issue.
---
Oh man, the 30 seconds I've wasted ragging on it... what will I ever do with this wasted life.
---
Dumbass.
---
So, asking for people to argue using logic and reasoning means I'm triggered?
---
And clearly, your apology means fuck all, since you continue with the crap analogies.
---
I'm saying to call them out on the shit they've actually done wrong, not comparing them to obviously illegal dealings.
---
It’s pretty nice, I’ve been running with it since day 1
---
&gt; No, they don't. Think if the target was you son, daughter, brother, sister or whatever. This ugly mob mentality is everything that is wrong in gaming and in this world.
---
And I'm sure Bethesda will ban all these players who are just bullying...oh wait, no they are just playing the game, a multiplayer, PvP enabled, interactive game.
---
And hey, it shouldn't be a problem right, the whales can just go to their private servers.
---
😂 What's a paragraph floop?
---
lol anonymously complaining online does nothing. Bethesda only listens to player count numbers, money and feedback. Have you sent in any feedback reports?
---
Sorry if it doesn't follow the rules I don't post much.
---
I'm hearing Zenimax is angling for an IPO, hence the change in business model. 
---
I guarantee they pushed wastelanders back to next quarter to let this quarter finish the year strong with a bullshit subscription service. They're going to figure out a way to profit off a "free" DLC and turn over strong profits in Q1 2020, keeping it going. 
---
I for one will not be contributing to this charade any longer. I'm telling yall who are buying this damned subscription and trying to talk up this bullshit are idiots. They are playing you like a fiddle and you're doing exactly what the decision-makers hoped you would do. 
---
If not a soul bought that shit this week, they would be walking it back.
---
Looks fine - you've got the main bloodied perks and explosive perks in place....
---
I reckon that you could manage with less strength an reinvest the point in agility or luck - you can't drop below 1 strength whatever you do (mutations, etc) and you don't need a lot of ammo for rifle / pistol builds. Also concentrated fire / glow sights might work better than longer pistol range (depending on who you're shooting)
---
I see you've hedged to use a rifle sometimes as well....keep an eye out for a bolt-action / revolver pipe rifle to take advantage of both the rifleman and gunslinger perks. This said you'll get more buff across all weapons by investing in bloody mess and dropping the 2nd and 3rd stars out of either a gunslinger / rifleman expert / master perk card.
---
Your perfect weapon for this build would be a BE pipe revolver as you could use tank killer then as well and perhaps squeeze in some stealth perks again.
---
&gt; But it's not okay to say you won't and then do it anyways
---
You sound like a 4YO. It's Bethesda's IP, they can and will do whatever they like with it and more power to them. Especially if drives people like you away.
---
Don't stress. Hopefully one day we will see you back in Appalachia! Love you
---
Yeah, who the hell cares about things like reputation and keeping and expanding the playerbase, let's listen to the same ten whales who didn't have a brain to quit yet.
---
Haha how ridiculous. A player to dislike another player because they took an action that wasn’t within their expectations or understanding. So off with your head...
---
The new content is responsible for separating players,  and the negatory influence on us hath bringeth shit from shinola. May our commonalities be destroyed by us who claimith destruction of our society cuz our every thought ain’t executed into sociable action. 
---
Again, you complaining peeps are poopers for open 
---
Mindedness, connectivity, and having an ability to admit fault...always to seek reprisal of an idea upon enlightenment of another’s action. The sick part is that usually the majority of players responses to facts or events released by B are demeaning and without regard to the positive intentionality, development, and actions done to continue to improve gameplay experience.
---
Thanks for the insight! TIL about US taxes xD
---
Like some i fell for the  atoms and unlimited scrap box . Thankfully only did one month
---
I believe there's around 200k active players, and that's anyone that logs in atleast once a week. I know most of the people I played with and the people they knew, none of us ever bought atoms. We exclusively used the ones we got from challenges. Why? Honestly, I could afford to buy them. Easily. Most people could. There's no end game really, so grinding out atoms was something to do. It WAS the end game.
---
Boom - thanks alot! I will take this in mind and refine the build!
---
It's also a type of entertainment more expensive than itself as a form of entertainment.
---
Would you think someone who spent $100 on a super-deluxe cinema ticket was of sound financial mind just because 'Hey, $100 is still less than you would pay for other forms of entertainment'.?
---
I also could endlessly repair my camp in that fight, something I could never do with the 800 stash limit
---
The grammar police lmao
---
Yeah, they MUST be using some kind of real version control, or making anything this big would be near impossible. Its probably as you say - that someone have fucked up merging a branch.
---
This is beautiful
---
I'm not stupid as to ever give Bethesda money ever again.
---
No problem - I added a bit about losing some of the explosive expert and investing in agilty / luck as well
---
&gt;It's not free DLC. It's  slowly turning an incomplete, broken mess into a real game.  They released an unfinished game on day one, slowly complete it over time, and call it free DLC, like they are doing us some big favor. But hey at least it's free.
---
Damn, it's true. Once you see it you'll notice it everywhere in the industry.
---
Fair enough. Don't stress about it then
---
It's not bullying, it's in-game acceptable PvP.
---
I think it's all a beautiful, brilliant,  publicity stunt for wastelanders guys.
---
too strange to be true
---
"enhancing the experience" now means "adding Singleplayer for a subscription fee"
---
Yes, we wanted singleplayer, but that was long ago and not for a fee!
---
Best new feature TBH
---
The only problem is learning inventory management. I had the HC backpack and rarely ever used it. Some players haven’t learned to prioritize and they hoard everything they have ever found, and doing so has disadvantages. But to each their own, they can play as they want, just live with the pros and cons of the style of play
---
Beep Boop.
---
Psn: ibiza4me  timezone:GMT
---
More likely they use a docker architecture instead of full virtual servers. If you have really fixed usage in terms of what runs and not many problems in terms of security then full virtual servers would be quite a bit of overkill and wasteful.
---
Man I think it’s one of the worst. I find that people think it’s good because of how rarely u run into others. Maybe 10 people every few hours but then people compare it to every other game and think there well worse but it’s just that u meet more people more often. I actually hate it
---
They always disappear for a couple of weeks whenever controversial (shithouse) changes are made. They were gone for about 2 weeks after the repair kit debacle.
---
And it's also OK to look at people who think they know the universal truth as assholes...it's also a society...
---
Probably don't even play, just coming from somewhere else to see the shitshow and make the issue seem worse than it actually is
---
Im gonna eat u alive
---
How can you see them as crooks? I don’t understand. They offered a product and a service for a clear price. I agreed with that price, and I’m benefiting from it with using their products and services. I do not understand why anyone is mad about this??
---
Yeah I’ve had my tent not place and someone’s camp was there. The camps more important than a tent.
---
That makes sense yes. To be honest I have no problem paying a bit into games I enjoy. I went back to fallout 4 for a while but planned to start playing again when human NPC arrive
---
Do you know what kind of game it is, now? I'm very confused, I've done a lot of inventory management the past 12 months.
---
&gt;It's not practical
---
It has been done over and over again, despite it being impractical. 
---
The WoW expansions just had areas you could not go into if you did not pay. WoW could afford to lose users, this game can not
---
My private server is gonna be open to the public for small flea markets. Just putting the finishing touches on New Floopwood and stocking the vendor. I posted about Flea Market Fridays last Friday but I forgot it was Friday and my new camp-town wasn't ready lol
---
My guess is that you can not get your money back.
---
They’ve fixed it now. But force closing is  when the game is loading in and you go out of the game to your dash board and shut the game down. Like if you’re in a infinite loading screen and you have to shut it down to restart the game.
---
naaa
---
 My reference to beta saves was simply to point out, those of us that bought and supported the game at launch should be compensated compared to those that shit on it endlessly until the free weekend, or bought it at 5 bucks from gamestop in the 8 wks post release, or the 15 that its usually listed at now. 
---
You're correct, we were not obligated to play the beta. But we paid for access, and received access. Your social circle that data mines and bug hunts are, again, not obligated to do so, but they put time and effort into a franchise they love, and in my opinion Bethesda should compensate you guys. If you submit verifiable bugs and exploits and do testing that normally they'd have to pay an employee to do, you should be compensated somehow. Even a 10 atom drop in the bucket. 
---
 We put our trust in the words "all new content will be free, no season pass, no pay to win." And I personally am holding my breath until the wastelanders release. If it's still free, I may pick playing 76 back up, but I refuse to give money to encourage lying to the consumer. If they lock it behind this subscription, ill be done. I had such high hopes for fallout with friends and the hits Just keep on coming.
---
Fallout Gamers are the most oppressed minority.
---
Awesome.  I hadn’t seen news they fixed it.  Thanks for replying 👍🏻
---
I appreciate the link, thank you! I've wanted to be a part of a Fallout 76 subreddit that doesn't have the negativity that this one has.
---
Actively encouraging and partaking in business practices that are slowly destroying triple A gaming is worthy of a little harassment I think.
---
May hook you up later today
---
You’re welcome. I say they’ve fixed it but I’ve been keeping my harder to find scrap in my normal stash, just in case.
---
I can tell you right now that it is going to be 100% free. There is still no season pass and when referencing content they specifically talked about  dlc. They said that they would not put anything in the atom shop that would provide a competitive advantage and if something did they would remove it until they were able to make it not do so
---
I wonder how that would work though in a single world like 76?
---
If it was like you say, new areas that can only be accessed when paid for, vaults would be the obvious one.
---
Non subs can walk up to the door but get turned away.
---
I dig the music and all the Halloween decorations too
---
Sales tax in the US is a complete chaos.
---
1. legacy weapons are weapons no longer obtainable in world; i.e explosive energy weapons no longer drop because Bethesda removed them as they were very OP
---
2. Bloodied builds have a lot of perk cards etc that benefit them greatly i.e nerd rage, radicool, etc and armour too (unyielding). this means they boost all their stats, carry weight is better, barter is better. so yeah why would you then not also take the weapon that gives you the highest damage
---
3. currently the highest base damage rifle is the fixer actually handmades can be shit too if you don't spec them right for your build etc.
---
4. this i don't know; i don't like it much either.
---
Good point to the discussion, inventory management is key. The only slight problem is, if someone only has space for lets say, 150 screws, springs and gears, and no useless junk kept after inventory management. That's enough for about 6 full turret camp repairs, and a couple of armour and weapon repairs, which can go in under 2 minutes against a skilled player who targets your turrets and generators, as opposed to 10 minutes with someone with endless stash
---
Having said that anything that could be seen in the open world that both sub and non sub could access other than cosmetic would cause problems.
---
&gt;the overseer's camp (what I think is the best tutorial zone I've ever seen on a fallout game, it's just surpassed by fallout 3)
---
The Overseers camp is 3 work benches and a chest in a circle. I'd genuinely love to know what makes you think this is "the best tutorial zone".
---
it's all a publicity stunt man, it's all too strange for me... like an halloween prank and, "dah daaaah! here wastelnders guys!"
---
Living the high life by having a couple of extra emotes and slightly more scrap in the most derided game this generation?
---
Just a guess but I’m assuming it’s due to cost of doing business in those places.
---
You were right!
---
1. Legacy is any energy weapon with Explosive, or a weapon with the Double Prefix. Heard legendary Dragons don't drop anymore either but I don't believe it. Explosive Gausses and Radiums are legacy
---
2. People want to push for max damage at all times, it's just minmaxers wanting to max. They also only want either Explosive or Faster Fire Rate
---
3. People still want Handmades because they have a larger clip and better recoil, but a Fixer is now the best auto rifle in the game for damage, plus it has sneaky sneak perks
---
4. People decided caps are meaningless (they're definitely not) and naturally when people don't put weight on the worth of a currency, it loses more and more value. This is actually inflation in action, it happens in real life too
---
You didn't ask about it, but be wary of taking 5.56 for currency, that's gonna be going down soon
---
I’m really loving the squad of morons dumb enough to pay for this shit going through the subreddit and downvoting anyone who criticises their incredibly poor decision making skills.
---
The truth is, the game was rigged from the start ;)
---
They make you toss out useful stuff if you do not pay. They waste your playtime if you don't pay.
---
It's like 99% of US Americans don't know that the whole world is working differently... better.
---
Because you literally get 3 misc quests, craft a gun, make food and craft an armor piece, besides of the little detail of the chemistry workbench plans.
---
Also it can be useful for inspiration for your first camp. 
---
There will be probably people around there so that can also provide you information about player interaction.
---
But if you think that I'm wrong, don't worry, it's my opinion.
---
Imagine that, a company wanting money.
---
Whoa, good catch OP! I'll have to check this out. Glad I caught this between all the neg posts
---
The line has been drawn in the sand.
---
They have their hands full, deleting all the opinions from their "forum".
---
You're late, buddy
---
Updated it with some of the lines that caught my attention. This robot is messed up.
---
You were dealt a dirty deed done dirt cheap
---
No, not at all. I believe your whole elaboration on how my comparison was out of place was completely unnecessary. What was even the point? That's what triggered people do.
---
1. Legacies are mostly Energy Weapons with the Explosive legendary effect. They cannot be rolled randomly anymore. There are other legendary effects, but those are not as valued by the wider community. 
---
2. Bloodied builds are generally the most reliable of the powerful, highest DPS builds around. Allows you to be ammo and time efficient as well as solo end game events such as Encryptid, Project Paradise and Scorched Earth with ease.
---
3. Not the highest for ranged weapons, but it's up there. It's behind some legacy Explosive Gatling Plasmas and the more recently added legendary The Fixer rolls. But it was the primary choice for sneak Commando builds and decent enough for Rifleman builds too.
---
4. Caps are easy to farm in this game and with millions, if not billions or trillions, duped into the game since B.E.T.A., many end game players don't consider caps to be that valuable. Usually the best items are trade only with other similarly tiered items. Sometimes you get players willing to sell though but it's usually at max caps and sometimes higher.
---
Yeah that's pretty messed up lol
---
Playing the game is not a proper protest.
---
A proper protest for this situation would be, stop buying atoms all together, stop buying subscriptions, stop playing the game.
---
Go even further, go buy The Outer Worlds and take pictures of you playing in game and then Tweet them to Bethesda, Bethesda Support and Fallout. Make comments about how it is nice to have a developer listen to their fans about what they really want and not what Todd Howard and greedy Bethesda want.
---
Don't waste your words. Some people just prefer to be ignorant.
---
FO76 was a good idea, poorly executed. Then it turned into a cash grab. This was truly Bethesda’s “jump the shark” moment. They’ve shown that they really don’t understand what makes a game good anymore. At this point, I’m nervous that Elder Scrolls 6, if ever released, will be garbage. And that sucks.
---
They fake all this fallout first situation... Think about it, is too stupid release this hateful stuff. "The truth is, the game was rigged from the start".
---
What's more interesting is the locations somewhat close proximity to Vault 79 which also appeared this patch.   
---
I'm most likely making connections that aren't there, but still...it's weird.
---
Couldn't agree more. One minute they say they are delaying Wastelanders till next year. I can live with that, cause i would rather they got it right then stuff it up and give ammo to the trolls. 
---
But then this! All it looks like now from a PR perspective, is that they delayed work on new content solely to put their efforts into a massive cash grab,and turned a community that was pretty good as we were all on a level playing field together, into a community of the have's and have-nots. And from people who were pretty friendly to one another, to now one that has some sections calling for harassment of players showing signs of getting the subscription. (NOT COOL,btw).
---
Also, you do wonder what is next. As 
---
O.P said, things were rolling along nicely on the gameplay front. Stability had settled down, disconnects had improved and bugs were disappearing. Yesterday, was the first time since the update i was able to go on for any length of time. Suddenly I, and the friend I was playing with,were both getting disconnects (2/3 times in an hour). Lag where i didn't even know how or what had killed me (one minute passing through peacefully, next a pause,followed by me dying and a scorched ghoul that wasn't there seconds ago slinking around). And once not even being able to reconnect after both had dropped out until we closed the game and started from scratch. Hopefully, it was just a bad run, but that little part of me made cynical by this controversial move was wondering if it's not beyond Bethesda to now "tweak" it's public servers to perform badly deliberately, so as to drive people into taking the subscription. Now, I've been playing from release day. I have been with it through all other faults and controversy,and stuck with it because i genuinely enjoy the game, and the devs always seemed to be improving it for the players sake . But that touch of cynical thought happening for the first time ever in an update has left a bad taste.
---
So this is how it is over here... ouch.
---
I have never had to toss out useful stuff. I sell excess cloth, leather, asbestos, and a few other things I don’t need a lot of but have ample room to store whatever I need.
---
Deserved
---
I put up a sign saying unstable rock and a power armor station inside my vendor greenhouse overlooking the edge of Seneca Rocks.  If that isn’t enough clue that you should prepare yourself for a possible fall, I don’t know what else to do for you.
---
But...uh...if you don’t buy something, I might log off.  Just saying.
---
No I think you're right, they added a lot of unmarked locations and expanded the wall in the Mire, and it's not that I was out of the map area, they added enemies up north too so it was expanded purposefully
---
Game was rigged from the start
---
How? There is no change to the way we have all been playing for the last year. The unlimited stash is a something that benefits players who haven’t learned if anything. They don’t *make* you toss anything, they make you think of necessity. If you can’t do that then you have an option available. If you don’t like either option well The Outer Worlds is pretty fun and you can hoard away from what I’ve seen. 
---
Yes FO1st is kind of over priced and they should look into it, but also there needs to be a steady way to growing the game. This sub is a fraction of the player base and I’m sure there is just as much subscribing as there is complaining.
---
Damn really? Did they have the holotapes on them? I guess I assumed they spawned when you did the quest. Never bumped into them
---
By accident.
---
"iTs TrYiNg To SaVe YoU fRoM iTsElF"
---
The people that bought the subscription and have continued to pay Bethesda to support this Abyssmal project are absolutely responsible. Frankly speaking I'm disgusted given that this sort of disregard for quality control is so detrimental to any game a company puts out. You all have shown them you'll pay for pretty much anything and the rest of us will suffer for it.
---
We know it's not top priority for yous guys over at Bethie, as most people here know how **FAKE** the **official** forum is. As low as one non-positive line and you're spam/plain banned.
---
Would be nice if they could implement a way like in ESO, to make everything sell-able without limit, to further reward you for your time
---
We are just talking about junk or? The game mechanics I think as made to make us think about the inventory in total. Shouldn’t hoard to much of anything, also why we have trade between players. Getting rid of certain weapons is a bit harder of a choice though, I admit I’m bad at that haha
---
It’s not 189 USD lol
---
When did I state I was in the US lol
---
Read clearly I said it’s $189 here :)
---
Where abouts have they expanded? I'd like to explore a little!
---
You can hold onto faith. I'm standing by my cautious skepticism. 
---
Further, while they might only consider pvp to be a competitive advantage, unlimited scrap box is the ultimate middle finger for player vendors. First subscribers have a bottomless box, fill it with crafting components and undercut any competitions prices. Ballistic fiber? That'll be 1 cap per piece,  Rather than 5.
---
And then there's stable flux. Classed as junk, it drops in your bag. It weighs in at a pound per piece. With the bottomless box you can stockpile 800 of each flux and not notice, rather than how I've got my box strictly regulated to have 10 of each flux stored, eating 50lbs. 
---
Also, totally unrelated, but it's genuinely nice to have an in depth discussion on this topic that doesn't spiral into personal attacks. Thank you for an enjoyable discourse.
---
Ha sucks to be me
---
The "little guys" shouldn't care about the hate and criticism because they're not the ones making the decisions that spur it.
---
Thank you you get it.
---
Oh and if you want proof that you know other countries and currencies other than the US exist I can show you that it is indeed $23 a month and $189 a year here :)
---
I understand, but your $189 comment is useless without context. I have no idea what $189 can you buy where you live. Is that a lot of money or a little money? Inflation in different countries means 1 unit of currency can buy different things depending on the country. 189¥ for example is nothing.
---
I mean no one really wanted survival or PvP in the game anyway, thats why they made it a completely separate mode.
---
The population was so low that they even discontinued that, so the demand really isnt there for high survival or pvp demand.
---
North in the mire!
---
&gt;the game sales were a flop
---
The reviews were horrible. 
---
&gt;I hope they know how much this game means to us, and how much the series means to us.
---
People got their friends excited, and were embarrassed by the product. If Beth'y cared, it would have shown on day one 
---
&gt;This stuff costs money and I believe that after Wastelanders everything will get better. 
---
I see no reason for that to happen. As the game grows, it will get harder to fix the bugs. As we get further from release, they care le$$ about the game
---
&gt;or they don’t do Fallout First and they're short on money which leads to crappy patch’s and updates to the game. 
---
What about the first $65?
---
I love the game but I'm mad at Bethesda for lying at me as well as the players supporting them in doing so.
---
$189 is very expensive. Xbox love gold upgraded which covers live and game pass is merely $20 a month and to add $23 is a lot. It’s a very big waste.
---
Just because it doesnt happen to you, doesnt mean it does not happen.
---
Empirical evidence is worthless, and thats what this is.
---
Well they re used those sounds from fallout 4. If you have a male character, you will hear misc lines from nate and if you have a female character, you will hear stuff from Nora. No actual dialogue. Only sounds when getting hurt or when exhausted.
---
if this is true i welcome it, gives me a reason to dust off my player damage VATS focused Gamma Gun.
---
Awesome thankyou! I'm gonna go right now and scour the area!
---
Its not about bullying in itself, its literally about sending a message.
---
If people that paid stop playing the game, that is a big message towards the devs and towards the idiots that shelled out and made it worse for everyone else.
---
The community speaks, but their words werent heard, so now actions have to do.
---
So based on what you are saying, the pricing is very similar lol considering what $1 buys in your country
---
So it sounds like the costs are very similar then seeing what a $ buys in each country lol
---
Absolutely worth it IMO, despite its flaws it can be a really enjoyable game. A lot of the side quests are really interesting and it delves deeper into the pre war aspect of the games. You will be able to buy it on eBay for about 10 pounds. Plus the new wastelanders update will be out by the time you get into a comfortable position
---
I think it’s important to ask yourself a question and have you be honest with yourself. Do you think they were turning it around or do you think over the course of the year and the awful release drove enough people away that the only people left made it seem like it was way more positive than it actually was?
---
Porque no Los dos?
---
Bro just sit right outside vault 76 in sneak and nothing will hurt you. Enemies don’t spawn close enough to be a problem. Your food and water shouldn’t be depleting so fast that you can’t read the help menu.
---
The best part is they did it the same week the outerworlds came out.
---
This has been asked so many times! There's only one way to find out.
---
And now you're accusing me of being mad? God, you're definitely not old enough to own a Reddit account, or even use the Internet. 
---
Are you a very young troll, by any chance?
---
Their model for this game are mtx and a unified player base under free expansions vs no mtx and paid expansions.
---
No. Al expansions are free. Always been that way, always will. They  added a subscription for the very purpose of keeping these actual content drops free.
---
You're welcome! There is a place for both subreddits, of course, but sometimes it's nice to see positive stuff from other people who also enjoy the game.
---
thanks for replying! yeah it was my bad lol i didn’t have the power connector connecting to the switch first and then to the door
---
They explicitly said quests will not be behind paywalls. You are just as bad as OP
---
No, the price is not fine. Even among players there's now a dramatic cost shift. 
---
Pc players, until now, needed to have a stable internet connection.
---
Console until now needed their internet, and their service membership.
---
As of the announcement, pc players get premium access for $100 a year, while console are going to be paying $170 for premium access. Why do console players deserve a 70% cost hike compared to other players?
---
Oh yeah that happened to me on xbox, so I just left it for about 8 months, and about 2 weeks ago I redownloaded it and its been very fun👍
---
Wow has millions of players so they can do that.
---
I don't understand why people are putting the tents in these places. People are pissed at us enough already for buying fallout 1st why place your camp where it will piss people off?
---
I put mine about 200yards away from the ammo workshop at the top of the map as I like to make ammo as I use it if possible. I never take from another player just clear and activate when unowned. 
---
Went on my travels no issues for about an hr then saw 2 players had found my tent. They took over the ammo factory fair enough I thought it happens a lot but I had no intention of pvp so carried on playing I soon noticed the same 2 players following me around shooting me then jumping in front of me during events trying to instigate pvp. I feel this is going to keep happening which so I'm only taking workshops in private servers now.
---
Ru serious
---
Absolutely, inventory management is the number one priority in Fallout 76 before any mission. With that set aside though, removing my essential repairing components,  freed up 200 slots meaning I could equip more damage resistance perks and remove carry weight perks, equip the full armour bag, and carry a ton of Stimpacks super's and pyscho's, and repair my turrets to no end
---
I’m pretty sure the standard .50 is still a hair less damage than the hardened .308, but better criticals. The refined .50 however does do more damage than the hardened .308.
---
The community will honestly give you enough free shit once they see you're a new player. Players always drown lowbies in stims, chems, food/water and ammo. It's rough starting out, we all remember the struggle
---
I have more fun with it than Fallout 4. You can play it solo or with other people.
---
Blame BGS. What a way to split the community. Well...what’s left of it.
---
No not really. I can’t think of a lot of things you can find for $1. And to say that $189 isn’t a lot when you don’t really know anything about what it’s like in my country is like saying “how are you guys complaining about $100? That’s cheap!”
---
$23 a month is basically my phone plan. Add $20 more for live gold. Add $20 more for my actual phone plan. $189 + $240 just for gold and fallout 1st. That’s enough to buy me a whole brand new Xbox. Considering I brought my Xbox 1S for $430
---
THAT is the point.
---
&gt;I’m sure there is just as much subscribing as there is complaining.
---
I bet many more people are paying than being publicly upset. That is why you make pay-to-win games: it get people to pay
---
&gt;Yes FO1st is kind of over priced and they should look into it
---
They had a huge franchise and lots of good will. They then released a game that was mostly empty and kinda broken.
---
&gt;there needs to be a steady way to growing the game. 
---
Fix the bugs. Make a big expansion. Get reviewed again. **Gain players and money by selling to new people** - not milking us
---
Imo it’s worth full price. I have 600 hours in game. No regrets. If you like FO4, like exploring and killing enemies, leveling up, collecting loot, competing quests the game is for you.
---
Fallout: NV: The Divide: Yes you can launch a nuke at the end of the DLC but this will prove that you haven't changed and that you are using the same values that the old world had that brought an end to humanity as we know it, it also changes the entire world based on where you choose to nuke, however if you disable the nukes you prove that people can be better and that they have changed for the better, because war never changes...but people can.
---
Fallout 76: I just launched a nuke to kill a Deathclaw over there hahaha kaboooom!
---
I'm out of the loop. What is adventure mode?
---
Bugs are not bad at all quit spreading misinformation lol. What did the mayor do to hurt you so bad?
---
Despite how buggy it's been, I still enjoy it, especially on PS4, can't seem to get past level 55 like but it's been fun
---
It's the nonces like the CEO and the board who are making these god awful decisions
---
&gt; Think if the target was you son, daughter, brother, sister or whatever.
---
Doesnt matter, if you publicize your opinion in a public space (that also means showing signs like that stupid dance or whatnot) then that also means it can be criticized and protested which includes people mocking/annoying you for it. It is only right.
---
Proof?
---
Survival was only beta.
---
We truly live in a society
---
I doubt its happening at all. No pics or anything. Just hot air.
---
Don’t buy it, it’s a sinking ship and many people have already jumped.
---
&gt; and how much disconnected you are from the community.
---
I feel like this isn't clear enough to some people. For a game with so many flaws and so many fuck-you aspects to it thus far, they've done a pretty shit job at working with feedback. All the ''we'll forward it to the team'' has led to so far seems to be people's suggestions showing up in the atom shop, more so than any problems being fixed. Things that were actually fixed took months. Dataminers and modders are getting on top of shit quicker than the developers. Some of the most stupidly basic QoL fixes feel entirely ignored. The bug backlog is huge. 
---
Either they don't have enough staff or resources to support this game the way it really needs (which is understandable), or they're just not listening to us.
---
You are worse for actually considering buying it
---
That’s my point. It sounds like $1 buys less for you in general than $1 here. Xbox 1S new is less than $200 USD. So what I am saying is it sounds like $189 for you really is similar in terms of local buying power to $100 USD
---
It ain't worth it, dude. These people are just delusional. There's a comment here claiming the scrapbox saved them 400lbs, and below it someone saying the subscription doesn't provide any gameplay advantages. This sub is possibly the most bipolar community on the internet
---
Prices are set at what the market is willing to pay. That's why you can buy CD keys from Eastern Europe for £20.
---
The market is obviously willing to pay above the odds to play their game.
---
Lol you moron 😂
---
Be careful you're not crafting things with acid (ie gunpowder) because it will use the things in your stash to craft and you can burn through insect parts if you aren't paying attention.
---
I don't think you're doing that, it's a bit strange. I hope you work it out. I store my insect parts in a vendor (hidden at my camp) for 25000, because you can access them from normal stash boxes, and they won't accidentally be scrapped.
---
We do not yet know unfortunately unless this is stated in Bethesda's terms and conditions. We'll have to wait a month to find out.
---
Hello all, I'm not sure about, but for me it seem that after the scrap box fixing of the last maintenance private servers and public servers are slow and lag again and it's so bad play with this lag in a private server, the stability of the game was perfect the fallout1st release day. It happened someone else?
---
I had the same problem until i learned they were being used when i crafted gunpowder or smelted lead and iron. I had plenty of bulk acid but the bug parts were being broken down and used before the bulk acid was.
---
And blame the douchey youtubers that started the sheer vile negativity of Fallout 1st.
---
I bought for month because I wanted the ranger "armor" and those atoms were like bonus. Imagine this way, 1€ = 100 atoms, premium cost 15€ and I got 1650 atoms (16.5€) PLUS armor that would normally cost 10-12€ in atomic shop.   
---
Was it worth it? No.   
---
It's ugly, clumsy, all it does is piss on Fallout New Vegas. Not only Bethesda tried to fool us with the best Fallout game that wasn't even made by them, they didn't wanna mention the name, only "iconic fallout armor". their nasty plan worked and many like me bought it. Fallout NV has better graphics and the armor looks million times cooler in NV.   
---
What about the other stuff? I don't give shit about private servers. Please give any good reason to have private server. It's not single player fallout. It's online fallout without people. How does existence of other players bother you? It doesn't. It's the idea of online fallout that bothers us. On positive note, Bethesda promised mod support and I believe private servers can have it. Similar to Minecraft realms, all players there must have same mods in order to work.   
---
Scrap box? Well it's kinda handy idea, my junk weights about 400 so it would be useful... IF IT WOULD FUCKING WORK!!! instead of storing the trash, it works as trash compactor. But when working i like it, but it's not worth money.   
---
That tent? I love it. It looks beautiful and cozy. Nothing bad to say about it.   
---
Those emotes? Lame fortnite shit. Bethesda why and how could you fall into their level?!   
---
Player icon? That sign that tells other players you are piece of shit who supports Bethesda's bad decisions?   
---
Atoms? Well it was kindla like plus minus situation. You could see it as buying some atoms but atomic shop sucks. Too high prices and garbage content.   
---
Overall score: *one rotten ghoul* out of *pimp boy 3000*
---
Would’ve had no problem if BGS didn’t get greedy
---
Looks like you're stuck with both the armor and sub.
---
No, they did not intentionally reuse those sounds: the male Sole Survivor was played by Brian T. Delaney while the male Vault Dweller was played by Kaiji Tang, and the female Sole Survivor was played by Courtenay Taylor with the female Vault Dweller being voiced by Linsay Rousseau.
---
If you ever want to play a game that has DLC, **you want to buy in early.** That way you do not notice the ridiculous price, as they have slowly raised the water temperature until you are boiling.
---
Oh, hush, you sanctimonious turd cutter. Like this one dude is responsible for whatever grievances you have.
---
And might I point out that you're shitting on someone for buying shitty games *in a FO76 thread*, a totally shit game at launch. So from my perspective, you're a goddamn hypocrite.
---
Shit a time traveller killed john Lennon
---
\^Agree.  
---
A few months ago I'd recomend buying and trying it, I enjoyed it back then. Now I honestly can't say there's any hope left for the game/studio. Decide for youself however.
---
You’re just in for that month, I even checked all the avenues to cancel and there isn’t one. If you want an extra month you can “extend” via the way you bought it otherwise it’ll just run out
---
To be honest, you're wrong. Even if you and I and every subscriber to /r/gaming stopped supporting this stuff, there's tons of people who will buy it because they don't care enough about the industry trend to not do so, and less people who will buy it because they can/have the cash/are "whales". And while you and o are the vocal ones, the fans who read all the news, we aren't the ones who bring in the most money.
---
$179.99 in Australia. For reference, at launch, FO76 was $99.95, and Tricentennial Edition was $129.95).
---
Dame that harsh now think about the repercussion for getting that long coat you like 
---
I mean im not guilty of anything but helping my self to an open collectron station scrap
---
Appalachia, the new apartheid.
---
Wow thats smooth
---
To be fair, did anyone expect private servers to be free?
---
Same as me. Few months ago I’d recommend this to everyone to. Used to be good, but now it’s going down under, and it shows. People will disagree but that’s fine, like you say they’ll have to decide for their self.
---
I got no bag and no power armor but I got 285 carry weight :D 
---
Help me my back is suffering
---
and toasted
---
That's the hilarity in this thread, the epic cognitive dissonance is epic.
---
I dont have any, sadly. I play FO76 with my brother and hes way too young to get it himself.
---
Gary!
---
Pathetic
---
Having stickied posts about The Outer Worlds on both fallout and fo76 subreddits is some great promotion indeed.
---
Yes, I dont play FO76 atm. As I wrote.
---
So the most heavily downvoted thread by a game company goes to...
---
Lmao what a legend
---
Maybe they came out with fo1st because they discovered the "game" is about to implode. fo1st sure seem like it was created in panic in about 10 minutes.
---
It's fine to love the game .. you do you.
---
It's not fine to condone the shady, shitty business practices BGS/Zeni is pulling with the game. Not saying you are. But it seems to be something missed a lot in these threads.
---
No one cares who loves or hates the game at the moment, they care about who and who does not condone the poo storm raging hard right now and how a AAA game is trying to nickle and dime them.
---
Dame i men Bethesda could have doen this the right way but nope they rushed the idea and now people are really angry
---
wait a minute, how do you differentiate between a non-1st player and a 1st player?
---
i’ve been on the game 4-5 month or so and it’s seems to be a good game. i have the subscription thingy. i don’t mind,
---
Maybe they came out with fo1st because they discovered the "game" is  about to implode. fo1st sure seem like it was created in panic in about  10 minutes.
---
Don’t pretend that it’s their fault. All they did was report on it.
---
Even if Pete Hines had not said any of the above, it wouldn't make me view the subscription in any more positive a light. I look at No Man's Sky and FFXIV, and what those developers did with their botched product, and then I look at Bethesda and their cash shop, and now their subscription which ameliorates some of the shortcomings/frustrations of their botched product (or, at least it was intended to, but said ameliorations don't actually work, lol) is being served up with a nifty little price tag. Regardless of what any given mouthpiece for the company has said, it's just not good enough, and only drives yet another nail into the coffin of what could have been an interesting spin on the Bethesda-Fallout formula, but which is likely to remain a broken, and then forgotten, mess.
---
**communism**
---
As if we didn't already have enough Obsidian good Bugthesda bad circlejerk, now Bethesda give people a reason to do it more.
---
Wait, blame YouTubers for what Bethesda did?  
---
Am I reading this right?
---
I bought fo76 for 59 aud in JB hi-fi at launch, so the subscription is 3 times the cost of the game new.
---
Bit of a suggestion for bulking out the town: if your camp can't be placed, you can stay on the server until the other person in your spot leaves, then place your survival tent where your camp usually is, then when you log in next, your tent will be inside the camp boundaries
---
Yep the game was mostly empty and they are expanding it with wastelanders which takes time and they have admitted taking longer than hoped. 
---
How do you think the bugs are going to get fixed, and expansions are going to come. Workers aren’t free, nobody can keep working on something they are making a small profit on by selling a lower and lower amount of copies of. I myself and from what I’ve seen many others will happily pay so we can get new benefits and for years to come keep getting new content because they are funded to keep doing so for their player and fan base.

&gt; Issue 1:  You have ruined the in-game economy with this release.  You  have now made it possible for one person to go and grab all the  workshops, gather all the ore, scrap, junk, whatever... take it all in  to a "scrap box" with no penalty and craft consumables at an incredibly  increased rate and let them return to the public server(s) with all of  this intact after doing so and then they go on and sell it.  Meanwhile,  the people who do not fork over the cash are left on overloaded servers  fighting others for scrap to do the same thing.  It is not pay to win  but it is definitely "pay to make another's hard work look worthless"  and that should not have been acceptable in the design meeting. 
---
Also, players with the Scrap Box have more stash space that can be used for vending, weapons, armor sets, aid, and other items. 
---
They can undercut the price of scrap sold by non paying players because it's easier for them to supply it. 
---
They can pick up nearly everything they come across and don't have to worry about its weight because they can just drop their tent and dump it into the scrap box. 
---
This fundamentally changes the gameplay loop by drastically lessening the need to consider an item's weight when looting. Going to a location and looting everything that can be scrapped then dropping the tent to store it before moving on to the next location.
---
I agree. But it's your choice whether to use it or not. Same as it is to buy it in the first place.
---
You’re putting the cart before the horse. They didn’t cause the negativity. The negative sentiment towards F76 and MTX already existed the Youtubers just reported on it. If you want to find the source of the negativity look at Bethesda.
---
Unlike Fortnite which is mostly teenage wasteland
---
skip it
---
Interesting.
---
Fortnites season pass is a one time purchase, not monthly fee. You only have to rebuy the pass when another season starts. One season lasts like 70 days or something like that.
---
You can't really refund something on the PS4 with some valid exceptions. Just turn auto renewal off.
---
Nah, fallout first is get some funds together to pay off the vulture capital company Zenimax borrowed money from.
---
LOOOOOOOL
---
no
---
I miss. I was one of us 7 players who played it. The excitement of wandering around was what the game needed. Shame no one else felt so and since only 10-20 players played survival Bethesda removed it.
---
1) currency rates fluctuate. They aren’t going to adjust prices daily to reflect. 
---
2) you aren’t accounting for local taxes and tariffs.
---
So after finishing outer worlds - time to start working on this.. 
---
For those interested; [https://discord.gg/YUKB8Ux](https://discord.gg/YUKB8Ux)
---
Some work has already gone into it and it's promising so far :)
---
Yeah, most people seem to forget that it is actually gear used by pre-war police riot units.
---
No, playing the game supports the game. Not anything else done by Bethesda. Does playing the game support Creation Club? Does playing the game support the AC settings in their office? Does playing the game support what color of shirt Todd wears?
---
Of course not. Playing the game supports the existance of the game. Buying Atoms supports Atom shop. Buying F1st supports F1st.
---
I went to the entrance to Vault 79, or at least to the elevator to it. I was able to enter the elevator, but the elevator wouldn't function. My buddy who was lvl 26, but wasn't in the enclave or brotherhood could not pass the lasers. Although that leaves two possible conditions being present for access via that lift, either an Enclave membership or Brotherhood membership. Now of course it may change later on, but it is interesting none the less.
---
Cant believe anyone would spend 100 bucks on that and defend it.
---
Oh yeah - these were the digital prices in the PlayStation store.
---
i would suppose some one at the top said generate revenue with a subscription or we’ll cut way back and move on to something els after wastlanders.  i wish they would throw a bone to the day 1 players on this whole deal cuz y’all kept the game alive. out of love.  that being said i am a subscriber and the private server is been fun so far.
---
Dont tell me outer worlds is epic exclusive.
---
will prolly add that to the paywall
---
found one for 5k, turned around and sold it for 20k.
---
And I love it
---
So Zenimax is trying to become like EA, Activision and Ubisoft...that's a bad, bad news...
---
I think what they were saying was the gameplay of Classic WoW was built with genuine/non greedy intentions, not the release of it. That’s also wrong, but less wrong than retail wow.
---
Thanks I've found that one now. I'd been looking near the water line.
---
They are all just collateral in this war
---
So you're annoyed at paying VAT?
---
Good to know you feel the same way 😢.
---
Nice find! Could complete BOS stuff first, then try it. Then we know what the conditions of entry are!
---
Found it, thanks. I must have seen it before and just forgotten. It's enormous.
---
Yes, go to the social part of the main menu invite them to a Team and then join nuclear winter
---
I'd say take points out of intelligence as u only need 5 r 6 points max. Just swap out perks when u need them.
---
Ehh- Ranger armor. I regret buying it though, not worth it at all - especially with the not-so-private servers.
---
When I saw the first lvl 100+ player a little year ago, I noticed you couldn't see the last level-digit on the map, suggesting no one actually made it past level 100 before it was released.   
---
It also had some &lt;Alias.blablablalocation&gt; errors that I was having in my new fo4 mod at the time.  
---
The type of mistake that I should be making, and not a rich experienced game-company.
---
FO4 was a dull, lifeless game.
---
If you're getting it cheap enough then go for it!
---
"Monsters from the ID" :)
---
Do you intend to sell them or are you just showing your collection? I'm interested in weapon number 30.
---
I used to be an adventurer like you...
---
I'm not really the biggest fan of it personally. I mean yeah it can be seen as a spooky tune and all, but given the Halloween music and soundtracks I've listen to, it just doesn't measure up to them. Still a nice touch though.
---
100% understand. That is still why unlimited scrap is not a wonder fix. Weapons take a lot of weight. If you like save things it will fill up also. Definitely a huge flaw.
---
Cheers
---
Im also on PS4 I'm level 110 and I can help you with everything you want.
---
I would recommend you to buy the game because it's really fun, but if you want a good story wait until wastelanders.
---
Despite all the people saying is not worth it, I think that the game has enough content for get you covered until wastelanders comes, and  again if someday you decide to play 76 I can help you.
---
PSN: Weezunder
---
dude the people on this sub have lost they minds. i’m getting down voted left and right. i paid the subscription and everybody here’s mad. i get that the game launched broken and they feel ripped off. but the game plays fine now and we have a free DLC comeing and also need more updates. they need to keep things going they can’t keep a online game going for the 2nd year off last years sales. i mean, to me the real game starts now.
---
Obsidian have made bethesda look imcompetent again, not that bethesda needed any help with that
---
What makes you think that survival = pvp? 
---
For survival I mean a tougher and harsher game mechanics and environment but no don’t worry if you die during an event you don’t drop your junk anymore ^•^ 
---
Because the game was already extremely hard, so they took away the only negative effect of dying. At this point they might just give us invincibility mode and it would be literally the same thing except for the location respawn.
---
Well, he wasn't speaking directly to you and I reckon a great deal of us knew he was implying that wherever he is it's a lot more expensive than the Americans are paying. It's pretty clear from just reading the comment what the tone was.
---
How is possible that a game uninstalls itself?
---
Have same psn if u want to send fr!
---
Id recomend it
---
What's it gonna take to get you to believe Bethesda's scams are bad? Todd Howard himself mugging you while you walk down the street?
---
I heard the same type of argument when Wizards of the Coast bought TSR (and again when WotC was bought by Hasbro). 
---
Anyone that played the new version of D&amp;D was ‘betraying the gaming community’ and ‘feeding into the big corporate mindset’. And yet, the game is more popular than ever and shows no signs of ever diminishing. And the overall TTRPG community is stronger than I’ve ever seen it in over 40 years. 
---
Times change. Communities change.  And what some ‘old guard’ may see as a broken path could be one that leads to a stronger future. 
---
All I know is that while we cannot control the actions of others like Zenimax or Bethesda, we can choose how we act towards each other. And toxic behavior because you don’t like a fellow gamers opinion or how they spend their money isn’t productive. All that does is allow you to vent your frustration on a proxy scapegoat.
---
I think people who bought the game during the launch window should be given at least 6 months of it (or a year) for free, for supporting the game.
---
Eat the rich.  
---
Or the stupid who fell for more micro transactions
---
I have no clue
---
Bethesda did state it in the terms, but when has Bethesda kept by their word? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
OP's is just as worthless. As far as empirical evidence goes, I'm more likely to believe the guy in the comments over OP. OP might be motivated by that sweet circle jerk karma.
---
I buy regularly atoms so the rest is just a bonus for me and its a good price i dont know why you guys think its such a bad price please explain and bethesda is still a company and guess what company's need to make money too there are more things you buy and consume everyday that are overpriced and no iam not on the exact same server iam on my own server farming ws and westtek as long as i want (you can server hop your private world and mobs will spawn again)
---
15,3,3,4,3,14,14
---
You can spend your money however you want. Doesnt mean I and tons of other people wont hate you for it, considering you are contributing to shitty business practices which only hurts everyone else.
---
Request sent
---
1. They never post on the weekends.
---
2. They are doing what they are told.
---
Did I just witness a stroke?
---
Well I play on console so now it's really impossible that the game uninstall itself.
---
Now that I think about it, console players have less problems than pc players...
---
Anyway, if you someday want to jump into console and it's a PS4 I can help you, don't worry.
---
Without boomers, you would not exist dumba**
---
That’s the kind of talk that gets someone annexed.
---
Yeah the only way I’ll ever get that crap subscription service is if they include it free with ps+. I’m not going to reward Bethesda with a yearly offering that is like 5 to 6 times the cost of the base game.
---
This. People are free to play whatever they want and buy whatever they wish (as long as it's legal). It's noone's else business. People who want to dictate what others are buying remind me of communists who ruled (and ruined) my country until 30 years ago. There's no good or bad purchase. What may sound like a bad deal for one is a good deal for another.
---
And I don't buy this "enabling" bullshit. Every purchase enables tons of things. So other people are enabling something one person doesn't like? Well, though luck - it's their purchase and maybe they want to enable it. Noone is enabling anything illegal or 100%-ly bad. What if someone doesn't like sports games? Are they allowed to harass sports game fans because they enable sports games?
---
Anyone who harasses other player for what they play and buy is a total asshole. There's no way around it. Everyone votes (or "enables") for whatever he wants, but only with his voice. What other people vote for is strictly their own and shouldn't bother other people.
---
Also, people need to keep CDPR in their minds - if we are enabling bad monetization practices with supporting Bethesda, then too many players are supporting employee abuse with supporting CDPR. And employee abuse is tons worse than some subscription. Where are people harassing CDPR players?
---
Yeah, how lucky I really am that I have to pay a monthly fee to not lag. Or were you referring to the Atomic Shop? Yeah, how lucky I am that I can earn clothes for free. Or some wallpaper. Yaaaaaaaay.
---
So you think that somehow removing the ability to get free atoms will somehow benefit me?
---
i only bought it just to finally be alone
---
Probably too dumb to know how judging by the dribble coming out of their mouths
---
Unless you’re an x-er born directly from Greatest generation I guess
---
Ive played 17 hours so far, it's a 5/10. It's got the good stuff from New Vegas (besides actually unique weapons) but its got the bad shit too (besides obscene amounts of bugs).
---
Oh I know what you meant. You're talking about the Liberator bots. I haven't played for a couple of months but I have played the game, though I got bored of it.
---
Idiots.    
---
  If people are getting this bent.
---
out of shape 
---
over a game,they have some loose screws 
---
Why be a asshole over this
---
huh ? if you aim and don't use VATS it takes a SB out in more or less 2 shots....
---
for a year yes. you could also buy Xbox Game Pass on PC and play it that way for 1$
---
You're just attacking fans.
---
You're right, just looked it up and regarding scrapbox:  " In the event your Fallout 1st membership expires, you’ll still be able to access any Atoms received and resources stored in your Scrapbox; you just won’t be able to deposit new additional crafting components."
---
If this is an attack to you I am sorry. I just want to understand why do you people keep going back to this like battered housewives after being fooled and fucked over again and again and again.
---
Oh so it goes from truth to truth................. right?
---
And put a few of those points in agility if you like sneaking around! Escape artist and sneak are kind  of a must, and covert operative even 1 point is over double damage for sneak attacks, best with silenced rifles...
---
Nope, it's because they reckon they can charge more, here in Australia we had a royal commission into why shit is so much more expensive (it came out that it was cheaper to fly to the US and buy a certain adobe product there and then fly back than it was to just buy the same product here)
---
And 99% of the conpanies investigated simply stated they "thought they could get away with it".
---
And particularly in todays day and age there is little to no cost for selling things internationally, especially with dlcs and subscriptions which have no physical or shipping cost, and they don't even have the cost of going through ratings approval, which itself is cheaper now since most countries will accept each others ratings
---
I can help you too, I'm lvl 110.
---
They must be, because with a graduate degree working on the financial industry services, I could not afford to rent a home for my self in a major city, and they think I am going to drop 2 digits for skin sprays ? Clearly its not my generation they are aiming at.
---
Thinking about it, it would need a lot more rigor than we have seen this far. From what I know of them, private worlds are just Amazon EC2 instances. However that would imply that you would need access to the game at a low level. Not only that, but you would require a clean &amp; common instance that was a known quantity. I doubt this is ever going to work the way the community thinks it will. The world's will not be stable. The only way this works at scale is if Bethesda do the mod integration. 
---
This is the second such mess I have followed. As I was a big fan of the community around Sony's "Star Wars Galaxies" too. Never played that either. 
---
I continue to believe that this is a live test case for what will come next with TES6, Starfield is a halfway house, IMO. The real deal is a much bigger franchise.
---
I only read about it in the bug round-up. Didn't play much after patch 14.
---
Nothing about Fallout First was a lie. They never said private servers would be free.  Not even the scrap box was a lie, because it’s not truly unlimited storage. It only stores junk/scrap. Stackable items. Which means that the impact on server stability is virtually negligible. Changing a ‘x25’ prefix to a ‘x25000’ is the same as changing ‘0000000000011001’ to ‘0110000110101000’. 
---
Having 1 piece of Scrap Wood in your stash has the same server storage impact as having 65,000.  True unlimited storage would be the ability to have 65,000 Combat Rifles in your stash, since those are separate items, not stackable items. 
---
The scrap kits and fridge were more of a lie than Fallout First.
---
The reality is the duckies and bunnies crowd - you know - the builders and grinders and collectors - or the non PVP non killing crowd- have whined and complained since day one to get what they want.  SIMS Fallout 76.  I like shooting and killing (players and enemies) and blowing shit up.  Yet at every turn there’s another nerf or change that takes away from those experiences so of course players will respond.  Bugthesda has catered to your type too much already so don’t be surprised when people act out and grief or instigate because oh by the way that’s part of the game.
---
On the plus side, Queen's body follows you as well. This helped for 2 or 3 bugged Queens.
---
$ donates the USA dollars when used by most people, mainly corporations that are based in the USA.
---
So them saying it's $100 for year is the truth, they didn't say it's going to be "100 of what your currency is called."
---
Come on peeps.   I know they suck and this whole thing is shit, but at we don't need to make up lies, they are doing enough bad shit themselves.
---
I'm an old man who's been blue and gold since Fallout 1.  I'm not mad or sad, just disappointed!
---
Isn't this the case for every company to have ever existed?? The only company that I know that has some insight on who their fanbase is and what they want is Adult Swim.
---
Its pretty obvious they put Wastelanders on hold specifically to drop their bullshit subscription service. Ever since the game came out they would constantly state they cant up stash size due to instability yet now if you enter the whacky numbers on your CC you get unlimited junk storage. Stop being a sheep and encouraging this shitty behavior, Bethesda has been very clear that this game was just a cash grab.
---
The $ is the context. You already know the game is $60 but this individual payed $189. Everything we need to know is here. Gtfo
---
When I first made my character and named him (Nathan), the Mr. Handys in the Vault used Codsworth's barks. I'm sure there's still more than a little FO4 under the hood.
---
Now this is praxis
---
Maybe the people like the subscription? When it comes to entertainment we decide based on strictly our own needs. We can't think of everyone else. Or when I go the the cinema to see Star Wars should I think "oh no, I'm enabling Star Wars movies. All those people not enjoying SciFi movies are going to suffer"?
---
You cannot judge a person's purchase just because you dislike the product. That would lead to extreme situations, because we don't enjoy more products than we enjoy. If I started giving people grief for buying what I don't like then I'd be attacking strangers 24/7.
---
Simply put, judging a person's purchase based on your preferences makes you an asshole...
---
they said they would never introduce subscriptions, seasonal passes or fees for anything but cosmetics. they lied.
---
What’s the difference between
---
1. Buying a game at launch before you see what the reviews and gameplay are like. 
---
2. Paying for in game content or features on a ‘bad game’. 
---
By your logic, anyone that preordered Fallout 76 is guilty of supporting a ‘bad AAA game’.
---
I would say buy it, its a fun and uniqe game
---
Nothing in Fallout First was a lie. The scrap kits were more of a lie than this. 
---
Private servers were never promised as a free option.
---
lol nice one
---
Nobody's talking about the Battle pass but please don't try to come on here and say that Bethesda hasn't broken any promises or hasn't been misled their customers or hasn't misrepresented their product. That just is not true. And I'm not going to sit here and research all the instances I told you already that I already did that in previous recent comments. You have wholly missed the point of what I was saying - Bethesda has screwed over their fans at every turn on this game, and exhausted any Goodwill that their players had toward them. So now they are going to have a harder time because everybody just assuming that it's another money grab, everybody's looking closer at the details and discrepancies and calling them out for it.
---
That's when you do when somebody screws you over time and time again, you stop trusting them, and you start paying very close attention. Not to mention the fact that Bethesda's handling of this game and their intentional misleading of their fanbase has painted a target on their back when it comes to the streamers and game reporters who run the outrage machine. They brought that crap upon themselves, there's no reason that a leading gaming studio with a huge following should have ever engaged in any of the nonsense we saw in Fallout 76. You can continue to excuse that all you want, you may just have lower standards than I do, but the way I see it if they get called out at every turn they will stop their bullshit.
---
See you at the party, Richter!
---
i mean its doing you a favor at this point my man
---
You do that in every starting area in every fallout game, except most of them have a town or some sort of world building around them instead of just... 3 benches and a box.
---
That’s my point.... it isn’t a lot more expensive because $1 has less purchasing power for all products where he lives.
---
Is there a full write up anywhere for this? Would be grateful if you could link me.
---
The game is not $60 in his country. He isn’t talking about American dollars when e uses those figures. Read the thread.
---
I'm just fucking around. The meaning of the word lBoomer" has evolved, becoming less about the age group, but rather the archetype.
---
Except the gas station didn't promise your get the premium gas with the regular gas. The regular gas works fine and doesn't do stuff like turn your car off randomly.
---
The airline didn't say you'd get the first class ticket for buying a business class ticket. The airline didn't intentionally make the conditions of business class horrible.
---
The grocery store doesn't poison the store brand food to make you want to buy name brand food.
---
We know Bethesda intentionally released this game in a bad state. Todd Howard admitted it. 
---
We also know Bethesda promised cosmetic only microtransactions and everything else would be free.
---
We also know they lied about the stash limit and how they could raise it any higher, because the scrapbox exists.
---
We also know the normal servers lag and hit detection sucks most of the time, so instead of fixing an issue THEY caused, they just make you pay for it with private servers. 
---
People wouldn't be angry if Bethesda made a good working product. But they didnt. The regular airline experience is decent, it gets the job done. You aren't miserable or anything. Fallout 76 is broken and still has tons of bugs from launch and FALLOUT 4. 
---
They are literally making you PAY to fix issues they caused. Why is it hard to understand that's bad?
---
That's been a thing for literally EVERY OTHER GAME ON CONSOLE. Don't act like this is some new ridiculous injustice. Ever other online game requires the PS+. Some subs for games themselves are optional, some are mandatory. 
---
Where are you even getting the $170 a year from?  PS Plus is more than that, so that's not it.
---
Fallout 1st is $13 a month, or $100 for the whole year. That's nothing. If you can't afford that, you should be picking up a second job(or first) job, not playing video games. (Outside of a handicap of some sort of course).
---
The price is just fine. The timing is terrible.
---
yeah ahahahaahahahaahahahha
---
hey hey now your talking to a bonafied fallout first member with all my dues paid in full. i wanted a private server and unlimited junk, and i got that. why can’t you just be happy for me and keep playing your game the same way you allways have. it don’t effect you. unless you want to become a member to.
---
I think we have had plenty of this sentiment posted over the past few days - I get it, you don’t like the new subscription thing, they’re charging too much money, they lied, etc, etc, etc
---
Give it a rest, it’s a video game. If you don’t like it then play something else. Jesus
---
Whats new?
---
Or go monthly, spend less at a time, more over the course of the year. The PS+ covers Beth using Sony's servers.
---
Has it? I'm pretty sure it's still the generation. 🤷‍♂️
---
Hey, we found the Boomer that plays video games!
---
That’s fair, thanks for the insight and not a knee jerk reaction. Not surprised that charging more in certain markets simply because companies can is factor. In this case, I though maybe it had to do with costs of running servers (primarily electricity) which is a huge factor with large server farms. I don’t know anything about the costs of running servers for a game so it’s pure speculation on my part.
---
That's precisely why they removed it. Most pvp people preferred NW to survivial. Not to mention PvP in the standard mode was and still is severely broken.
---
Actually you can kill anyone if you know the right things. Even pacifist players
---
Do you respawn at the tent if you logoff there? Can the tent be damaged by enemies? I haven't even seen a screenshot of what the survival tent looks like yet.
---
That must be what happened to mine thanks man 👍
---
No idk I've had a lot of random encounters happen since the patch too. I was walking through the ash heap and was at the edge by the savage divide. I ran into a mr handy and mrs nanny playing guess who indefinitely and it felt like they were responding to eachother in an automated fashion. One would ask and if it was correct the other would respond properly. I looked into it and it's old however. With how the game had been bugged to see a randomized system working autonomously I was surprised.
---
"We've come to teach you a lesson!"
---
Yeah, there's fuck all to do in the game. Pvp was great, I try to get bounties and build a workshop Fort. Sometimes that works.
---
The only difference is now the small lot that were looking for a reason to "jump ship" are doing it VERY vocally. There's actually been a marked increase in player activity, despite the handful of people leaving.
---
Because I wanted to..?
---
video wasn't too bad
---
I would say get it, and if you don't want to constantly struggle with junk in your stash then also get the sub. Totally worth it.
---
Hell yeah. If I still played the game, I’d do the same
---
I miss it so much!! I'm not coping well. I just want my favorite game back.
---
yes, cuz they support them, and they will make much more stupid decisions because of them. - next they will announce that the wastelanders update will have only for fallout 1st owners, and it will continue.
---
To observe the car crash first hand.
---
They should enable server wide pvp just to see what happens. Reckon it would be like the purge, people lynching the 1st clubs and burning down camps.
---
it just works
---
There should be an additional fee of 100$ per month for anti-harassing mechanism for the fallout first members
---
Haha this so put me off GTAO
---
Mostly just to see about the private servers
---
&gt;  I didn't know Pete Hines
---
Please show me when I mentioned Pete Hines? Or are you going to try to argue that Fallout 76 devs *haven't* been doing a lousy job? 
---
&gt; Yes, that makes harassment okay! Let's excuse harassment because the company making the game did a bad!
---
Please show me where I said harassment was ok. You sure do like jumping to assumptions based on literally nothing but you imagination. Do you even read what you reply too?
---
1. I don’t like storage management 
---
2. I don’t like paying to fast travel, the tent helps a bit
---
3. Monthly atoms cheaper
---
4. Haven’t used private world at all
---
That's a good point.
---
Eh. I appreciate the sentiment but up/down votes are pretty meaningless. 
---
People have been downvoted for being right. All the people that declared the p2w aspects of the Atom store well before we hit the scrapbox, people with coding/database backgrounds on the lies that Bethesda told regarding not being able to better manage stash space due to server limitation or restoring lost items/characters. The list goes on.
---
This is no different.
---
\- next patch:
---
Fallout 1st owners got new music.
---
I’ve been thinking of it, but lack of 2FA just keeps me from pulling the trigger.  
---
I’ve wanted to pick up ATOMs on more than one occasion, but without a solid, secure system for my account, I won’t.
---
Yes they did - I live in the UK and the price is £100 for the year
---
Sorry but we demand a more comprehensive explanation from you. Start with your childhood. Did you hate your father?
---
I love this
---
&gt; I don’t like storage management 
---
I feel like they made storage management annoying just so they could let me buy my way out of the task.
---
This hole game is a horrible Vault-Tec experience
---
"War never changes" yeah neither does bethesda
---
I had $15 on a throw away greendot style card and said fuck it.
---
I figured I’d try it for a month and see how it goes.
---
I don’t plan to buy a year, and unless the rewards are as good or better for next month I probably won’t get another. 
---
Mainly just needed some iconic NCR and the atoms were worth it. Pretty sure the emotes ended up being my favorite part. 
---
I will say that all this shit should have either just been in game in the first place or at least available in the shop for everyone. 
---
Beth seems to want to separate its fan base. Casuals, hardcore, whales.

I bought it honestly because it was a better value than buying just the atoms. And after I purchased it and loaded into my first session in my "private world" is when the real value kicked in. There was no lag at all, and I usually have a little lag. Partially my IP should be blamed for some of the lag. I've honestly probably only played around 3 or 4 sessions on the private world. But all in all I'm pleased with it, and so are the people who have joined me. If your on PS4 and wanna try it out, let me know because I would be more than happy to let you play.
---
Survival mode was the best mode!
---
Yes that's what's up, tested it extensively with a friend and I can safely say all these morons screaming about reused servers are disgusting trolls/had no idea until now how the raw spawns looked.
---
They still have a large franchise and plenty of goodwill. 
---
The subscription is actually cheap when you compare it to other ones.
---
They can't fix the bugs without revenue to pay the dev team. Everyone who is going to buy the gane has, and those who haven't aren't going to bring in the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to maintain the game and release new content. 
---
If all you ass hats would have purchased atoms once a month instead of solely using the ones earned for free, they wouldn't have felt the need to roll put a subscription. So, it's actually the fault of everyone that went out of their way to not spend a single dollar on the game.
---
Because they want to support the developers, and make them this game Pay to Win,
---
1. Fallout 1st owners get infinite ammo's
---
2. Fallout 1st owners get increased damage in PvP
---
and soo on, soo lets continue supporting them.
---
That private servers wouldn't be free wasn't what I meant. That they would be payed should have been clear to everyone that wasn't completely delusional.
---
The point is that what we got aren't private servers, just private rooms. A feature many games offer for free at release.
---
The lie was that every content they would release THAT ISN'T COSMETICAL would be free. They already broke that promise with scrap kits, the fridge etc. and now Fallout 1st which splitts the player base in two halfs.
---
I can't even afford the monthly subscription in my country even if I would like to get it.
---
They use community suggestions and charge us for them and the game still is in a bad shape bug wise with some bugs around since Fallout 4 or even longer.
---
It's should be pretty clear now that Bethesda doesn't want to make a good game (That many people around here would gladly invest in with their money) but instead want to make a game that earns them as much money  as possible and are willing to lose large parts of their loyal player base.
---
If you want to support the greedy business practices of many modern gaming companies sure do so. But you are helping in destroying something many people love.
---
Lemme guess, you're hearing that from Luke Stephens, right? A guy that has no background in finance outside of an unfinished bachelors degree based on information that's close to 4 years old.
---
The community in Fallout 76 is freaking awesome. Mind you there are the handful of douches out there but overall it's amazing.
---
The game itself is amazing. I remember hearing all the grief it as getting before it came out but being an avid Fallout fan I figured screw these naysayers I'm gonna get it cause I wanna try it.... I've been on since christmas I'm level 120 rocking my excavator PA - shotgun/rifle build and loving it. 
---
As for the help, plenty more where that came from
---
After you farm all the mats that you needed for it sure. Which still takes the same amount of time that it used to. The stash doesn't magically give you unlimited of every item. It just gives you the ability to store as much as you want.
---
Waiting for confirmation that the the junk bug is fixed.  Might also wait until they make the server option truly private.  Then I'm in.
---
 I still have additional playthroughs with different character builds in mind.  I also enjoy building themed C.A.M.P.S..  The subscription provides the Atoms and convenience features that make it a value...to me.
---
$69.99 Canadian a year for PlayStation plus.
---
If the subscription is a static 100 then the point of $170 still stands. If they alter the transaction to be $100 US then it'll be a little more. 
---
I'm honestly having difficulty thinking of another game that is both pc and console, that contains a subscription, that isn't free to play at base. 
---
Insults aside, your point has merit, if you can't afford 170 a year into your budget, maybe gaming isn't the hobby for you. However what that marketing model does is make it so every game wants your subscription. Let's say every game wants a flat $100 a year, plus initial purchase. 
---
Do you want to play call of duty? 100
---
Fortnite? 100
---
Fallout? 100
---
Fifa? 100. 
---
So now we have 4 games. And we are paying $470 a year. Every customer would eventually hit a point of "do I want to be able to play this game anymore" rather than "do I want to play this game, that I paid for"
---
I believe i either have a couple of prime pipe plans, or have learnt them, I'm also on xbox so I could help you.
---
So is that the total price including the VAT tax you UK's pay?   Or are you paying that on top of the £100?
---
Rip. I dont get paid enough to be comprehensive.
---
Don't lie to him to try and get him to not buy.
---
Sultry.
---
:)
---
Psn: Ye-oin
---
Add me.ill be on Wednesday when I catch a day off.
---
GST is 10% That's make it $1.90 more or $20.90. There's still $2.10 worth of greed not accounted for.
---
I'm really interested, where'd you hear the increase in players? Any source? How many active players are there in fo76?
---
I payed only for 1 month to get atoms and the ranger outfit
---
CMs, blink twice if you're under duress.
---
i bought the subscription. why? 1) becouse  i want the perks. 2) i plan to play this game for the next year more or less so in the long run i’ll have a better experience. 3) i don’t feel guilty, in my view the folks that sub and buy atoms are keeping the game going, we are funding  year 2 of fo76. y’all folks who bought the game day 1 did you part now the wales are going to do there part.  ok, should all this be in the base game free. sure why not. but it’s not and. i’m going to be playing wastlanders  on my own server with unlimited junk and that’s what i want.  
---
also, you guys know this game was majorly fucked up with all the dupers, then people are buying guns $50 a pice on ebay, and PvP gear is 5-10k a pice or more. you can buy caps online, buy gear with paypal, they is all kinda money stuff going on with this game.  it’s it’s own little world and we’re all playing it our own way.
---
there is also the halloween event pumpkins in the area around jes-2r. if you wanna check out what those camp rewards would look like when placed
---
People are still complaining? I thought you all would have moved on to other games by now like everyone promised to when the patch came out...
---
Add your platform.
---
Bit of info on the Wiki but nothing much more.
---
youd definitely need a big damage boost so id suggest getting your hands on junkies weapons get some addictions and make your build focus on vats use (high agility and luck) thats probably the best way to make a semi auto energy build work
---
I made out with 800 caps and a decent amount of junk after a group of three with explosives thought it was gonna be that way. People get an explosive rifle and think they’re untouchable lol.
---
Who exactly told you that wastelanders will be for 1st subscribers?
---
There isn't. It's a vain hope of people not wanting the game to disappear. I regularly see no more than 5 people when I log in (myself included).
---
well, i would reccomend you make your camp at The Whitespring golf club
---
A lot of new stuff, watch for a list of the new things that the last dlc brought.
---
Harass as in bully and grief them? No, that's terrible. Should never be condoned.
---
However. the Fallout 1st crowd aren't above criticism for supporting an anti-consumer practice that Fallout 1st. Not the subscription model part. Nothing inherently wrong with that (well, aside from the other two monetisation models already in play). However, putting core requests that are much needed for the base game behind a paywall is no bueno. 
---
If people support this by paying for Fallout 1st, they deserve the criticism that's coming. Polite and fair criticism, ideally, but criticism all the same.
---
Paid single player subscription.
---
The sad part is most are likely kids who don't know better. So people are picking on children.
---
Yea seems people just like to hate on Bethesda and anyone that tries to support them. 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Even though 3/4 of the people I saw last night all had NCR armor.
---
Lol what are you talking about?
---
Look into junkies or bloodied - as the other guy said you'll need a big damage boost as laser weapons need some more buffing. Go for semi auto, and a lot of perception, agility, and luck. Intelligence wouldn't hurt so you can modify your weapons better
---
Someone posted in the sub saying it doesn't just runs out but it renews if you don't explicitly cancel. Is that not the case?
---
Yeah, but now you can PAY for them!
---
That’s what I was about to say lol
---
The problem is greater than that but at least that highlights a specific case.
---
It only gets worse once PvP is better balanced so more people participate and we get prestige levels where levelling up actually matters. Then the p2w aspect really becomes apparent.
---
I heard the same ‘you’re supporting the destruction of something I love’ about 20 years ago when WOTC bought TSR and then released D&amp;D 3rd Edition.  And the TTRPG community completely disappeared... no, wait, actually it’s stronger than it ever was before. 
---
See, you know that Bethesda and Zenimax won’t feel any sting from your rage. And that bothers you. But you desperately need to know that someone is punished for making you feel this way.  So you lash out at a peer for having a different opinion than you. You try to belittle them or blame them for Fallout First. Because it’s not enough for you to express your dissatisfaction, no... you need someone to blame for this that you can actually get to and affect. 
---
The classic trope of the downtrodden husband coming home from a horrible day at work and then beating his wife and kid. He can’t lash out at his boss, because he’s get fired and it wouldn’t have any affect on his boss. But he CAN take out his frustration and blame his wife and kid for something. 
---
This is displaced aggression, and it’s a coping technique, albeit an immature one. 
---
You can’t get a reaction out of Bethesda/Zenimax, so you lash out elsewhere. It’s a temper tantrum, nothing more.
---
You have scrap kits that do exactly this time. I mean if you want a robot to do that, sure but, as with the scrap kit, you're going to have to pay for it.
---
Bethesda aint give two shits about anyone who plays this game tbh
---
I got F1 I had to go in 2 adventure mode 4 something I ran in to a level 3 and I did the mothman dance 4 them while in my NCR outfit and they loved it lol
---
Do not focus on the explosive aspect. Go high luck, high agility, buff criticals, bloody mess, get eagle eyes and speed demon mutations. Concentrated fire 3 and Gun fu also. 
---
Don't pay attention to those who say you can't do well with a revolver. It is doable, ammo efficient and fun. Vats critical builds make them shine.
---
If you ever find an instigating or stalker, use them instead of the bloodied one.
---
What do you mean by "harass"? People who don't like the game have a right to express their opinion. If this bothers or upsets someone, too bad but that doesn't constitute as harassment.
---
That's the one I mentioned as being north of Alpine River Cabins. Weirdly hard to find, but I got there in the end.
---
Oh yeah!
---
Well, it isn't just yes. It's yes for now until the world hits an 8 person limit.
---
There are plans for controls to allow owners to better control access to their worlds.
---
Hope you're close with that person on your friends list :)
---
If you're going to add in the cost of ps+ might as well count the cost of the PS4 itself, or the PC. Wow you PC players are really getting hosed.
---
Not the game, the people who buyed the subscription. Obviously you can express yourself.
---
But there's no point on bother and grief people who decide to use their money to pay for the subscription
---
i guess we’ll see if all that limited junk space really is pay2win
---
What do you think the poor reddit community manager is doing right now?
---
It's a bug. Forget shotguns until they fix them. You can have a fully modded instigating shotgun with all perks and still need 10 shots to kill a gulper.
---
The only thing that works for a shotgun Is enforcer, to cripple everything.
---
Jet cannot be found anywhere in Fallout 1. In Fallout 2 you come across several towns which are now struggling with this newly created drug coming from New Reno. 
---
You can say Myron found it, but can you explain how Jet is strewn about all over the east coast as already invented, yet not so on the west coast?
---
Thanks for the link didn't know about this sub definitely joining
---
The number of posts here, on Reddit, talking about it. I read three today, so far. Griefing has intensified and now it has a bit of an excuse.
---
I haven't purchased it but a friend of mine did. He got one month of it so myself, him and a lady friend of ours used the private server just to farm the shit out of legendaries and fusion cores. 
---
Getting all the junk before anyone else and not worrying about being attacked at the claimed workshops is nice. Got a shit ton of fusion core too! Went to whitesprings and monster mash event for a shit ton of legendary and XP farming. But on the negative side the world feels so damn empty, only 3 of us for the couple hours we were on, just didn't feel right.
---
I asked him about the stash space to which he said was awesome but it was only for junk so he was still going to have to be careful with meds, guns and ammo. 
---
I asked him about the ranger outfit but he said he had not look into it yet.
---
The tent he seen but hasn't used it yet, thinks it's really cool.
---
The Atoms he said he was gonna spend this shit out of... He openly admits that if the game was pay-to-win he would spend like it's candy.
---
Basically what I'm reading is that you pay $100 a year just so you can turn a game that was traditionally a single player experience that was turned into a pseudo-MMO.. back into what is essentially going to be just a single player experience in your own private server..
---
Why not just play FO4 with mods at this point?
---
I can come to your camp and build one for you
---
PSN is Woodchuck
---
Did you do this alone? How long did it take?   Do the robots constantly keep coming at you?  I haven’t don’t it yet and fear it’s too much for my average character.
---
Did I say something wrong, I shan't report anything then, I give up.
---
So you're talking about griefing people in game? Is there any actual evidence of this happening (griefing simly because they bought the subscription?). Also, hasn't griefing been part of the game ever since its release a year ago?
---
Well I listened to the people that played it and hated it without trying it myself.
---
Haha great stuff, go on.
---
Hurt those who hurt the gaming genre by supporting bad business models
---
Hi.  Good overall build.  Below are some comments/ suggestions:
---
Endurance: consider Rejuvinated for 2 points (more HP and faster AP regen).  Fire Proof is helpful against SBQ and Scorch Beasts and Super Mutants.  Also very helpful in PVP vs. explosive weapons.
---
Damage Resistance: Depends on your play style.  It may be better to do more damage and kill enemies faster than.  You may play around substituting Barbarian, Ironclad and Evasive for damage perks (unless you are building for PVP). That will also allow you to put more points to other Attributes / Perks
---
Charisma: consider Field Surgeon (if planning to PVP). Tenderizer lvl.1 for that extra 5% damage.  Travel agent (if being thrifty in caps)
---
Intelligence: First aid (especially if PVP), Demolition Expert if you have an explosive weapon, Pharmacist for Nuke zones, or Scrapper for extra materials 
---
Agility: Born Survivor lvl.1 will greatly increase survivability (highly recommend it).  Dodgy is a very good perk.  You may also consider Action Boy.
---
Luck: Serendipity (if out of power armour); . Ricochet (fun - not for its damage, but for protection when you are closing the distance with ranged enemies)
---
Shotguns are still a bit bugged.  You may consider a heavy weapon alternative - which would go well with your main STR.  For example Harpoon with flechette mod and/or Gatling gun or the traditional MG.50
---
Makeshift warrior, white knight, lucky break: these are quality of life perks and don’t help with damage or survival.  My recommendation would be to repair weapons/armour to 200% with Weapon Artisan and Fix-It-Good.  Also you get 150% repair kits from SBQ that can be used in an emergency.  This will give you 8-9 points to play around with.
---
&gt;next they will announce that the wastelanders update will have only for fallout 1st owners, and it will continue.
---
Build a straw man and burn him to the ground!!
---
I paid, and i think the benefit of the private world is good enough in itself. There was rlly no need for the extra stuff, but im glad its there.
---
FAVORITE game of all games? Man, they really need to play more games....
---
It sucks for me cause I love that armor and only bought fallout 1st for the private servers cause some cunts kept following me between servers and that armor and emotes are just bonuses
---
Idiot
---
Well they have created an actual player faction system I guess
---
Yeah, Bethesda's loyal fan base has totally turned on them.  Has absolutely nothing to do with a 2.5 Billion dollar company taking every opportunity to screw their fans over on this game.  What a bunch of A-holes, those Bethesda fanboys who demand quality and honesty from the game developers they support almost blindly.  Poor, poor Bethesda.
---
That's where you're wrong kiddo. You definitely can. I'm a regular PvP'er, and there's certain tricks you can use to kill Even pacifist players or people not at workshops
---
Oh yeah they said about that , why would you grind for mainframe cores tho ? Aren’t they literally useless outside of silos.
---
I really think this membership thing would be viable at 50 or 60 dollars. The amount a family member might spend at Christmas time. 
---
 I'm not going to spend it myself but it might be good to put on your wishlist. 100 is above average for most.
---
I don't think it's about the money, so much as it is the idea of pay to win. Until this point, the playerbase has been a single body. You all suffer the same issues together. Now some people can pay to make some of the issues they face disappear, at least in theory.
---
This has been the case since the invention of money. It's a universal solvent. However, it doesn't just dissolve the issues you face. It dissolves the bonds that tie you together too. 
---
This is, as Karl Marx and Thorsten Veblen observed, the stratification of the unitary playerbase into classes. The haves and the have-not's. 
---
There are other ways to do this, Eve online does it another way. But FO76 is not Eve, and Fortnite is cosmetics only. The Fortnite item shop prominently displays the text: "Item shop purchases offer no competitive advantage." Or something like that. Because a better gun will unbalance the game. When they introduced robots to Fortnite that was unbalancing. The players complained. Epic removed the robots. It's about the perception of advantage. Again, FO76 is not Fortnite, but the idea is the same. You purchase what others cannot. You have perceived advantages that other do not. It is the perception of unfairness, that annoys the players that cannot pay or do not want to play. Again, it is a fundamental perception of unfairness, with no corrective action available.
---
Grab all nine rifleman cards to boost damage along with tank killer and the luck card tormentor.
---
Really you want to Max out perception and agility while throwing some points into luck and endurance while dumping strength 
---
I run a laser rifleman build and I easy take down Scorchbeasts 
---
If you're on PS4 BoSAC-LN_Hayes is my name,  hit me up and I can make you a decent laser rifle or sell you an anti armor one for a decent price
---
Given the number of apparently new single digit players I'm seeing on every server, whatever their motive the publicity is making them money so that hopefully will fun new content.
---
It’s not the first and won’t be the last I’m sure.
---
Yes yes and yes
---
Sure there is. If it bothers them so much, maybe they will rethink their purchases next time. Maybe they will see other angry players and understand that AS consumers we are in this together. Trying to find a way to say it .. 
---
if ten people pitch in and get a pizza with mushroom and the pizza shows up without mushrooms.. what do you do? The smart and correct thing to do is call, complain, and get what you paid for along with apologies that it wasn't right to begin with. Now with this, it's like 6 of the 10 people decided they didn't want to call and complain,  they got money to burn, they ordered another pizza with mushrooms. 4 people are fucked. They still sitting on that plain pizza and now they can't have mushrooms unless they pay AGAIN. Do you get that? We have every right to be angry.
---
If you think Fallout 1st will give free Fallout 5 and off on other games, you're the joke here.
---
It was a genius plan indeed, not for the reason you think though. But because they know that idiots like you will always suck up to them and make crazy theories while being blind to their obvious greed.
---
That was a really smart move that in fact will increase sales of their already well received game.
---
From Obsidian that is. If I said Bethesda that would be sarcasm.
---
What core request are much needed for the base game?
---
You can spot them by accident, like all the other bodies.
---
Ah. Today’s the day huh?
---
Perhaps.  But I'm glad people are all over them on the crap they pull.  Hopefully at some point, if they keep getting called out, they're going to realize that they just need to stop screwing over their fans, deliver on what they promise, and knock off the profit over quality nonsense.
---
Well thought out.
---
:) If that’s wasn’t Bethesda’s initial thinking - it should be now
---
This fallout first is Too stupid to be true man, it's all a brilliant publicity stunt. "the truth is,  the game was rigged from the start" ;)
---
I for one sit and watch my computer trying to get the motivation to play anything and when I do I close the game 5 minutes after opening it
---
Supporting this trash only makes more companies release bad games and bad monetization practices for the rest of us. So yeah, if you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem.
---
Really? Didn't know that.... well I stand corrected then. Sorry about that! Should have looked it up a bit before making claims. But it honestly sounds like it.
---
I haven’t had any issues with it. But just to be safe wait at least one full minute before signing out of your game after you deposit anything into the Scrapbox. The issues seem to be when junk is deposited followed by an immediate exit from the world
---
That is true, 4 guys tried to gang up on a me, I still play, but lol Pacifist mode is on always now.
---
Really? I'm giving some rational points which as a prove for Bethesdas shitty business practices and all you can answer me is some kind of pseudo psychological analysis of somebody you've never met. Sorry dude but thats weak. If you can't defend Bethesdas shitty business practices you should stop playing devils advocate for them because you're blaming yourself here ;)
---
I'm sorry that you're probably addicted to the game and now need to go on the internet to defend yourself and a greedy conpany that doesn't care for you.
---
Regardless of price, they sold power. Lowering the subscription cost might satisfy some but the scrap box crossed a line in many ways.
---
So your plan is for them just to release everything right now, no matter what state it is in, and then abandon the game and shut down the servers. 
---
Hmm. Going to vote a no on that, Kevin. We will need you to clear out your desk though.
---
Buy and activate the key over a VPN, that way the transaction doesn't take place in your country.
---
You could wait until the outfit isn’t available anymore, then people magically won’t know where you got it
---
The emotes were one of the big pushes for me but mfw people downvote this confession :V
---
thanks for the info, much appreciated!
---
¿por que no los dos?
---
That’s the total price. 
---
Do you have to pay Vat on top of the $100?
---
Same here it's the only game my wife's plays it's fun in our own world
---
No it couldn’t be lol smh😂
---
Lol nah we just laughing at you.
---
Anyone still playing this game is equally an idiot and bad for the gaming community.
---
One workaround is to buy it from Humble Bundle. You still have to add it to an epic account, but I just add the shortcut to my desktop and never have to open the launcher.
---
Sorry, i dont have the entire bit memorized (though i wish i did) so i took the comment at face value
---
Maybe wait a few months for the Wastelanders update, to see if they add good content, I don't know if its truly worth it right now. It has good parts, I like them, but after the disappointments in the past couple of months I am kinda sad that I bought it. And expect a ton of adds every time you enter the game, which multiply it seems, even if its a game that you buy...
---
Ignorance is bliss, as they say. What makes me feel good inside is knowing how much more intelligent and creative I am compared to idiots like you :p
---
It’s their money to waste, you shouldn’t do that but it’s still funny
---
If more people thought like you, there'd be a whole lot less vitriol in the Fallout 76 subreddit. Unfortunately, there seems to be two groups in this subreddit, those who worship the game and those who hate the game, and if you're anywhere in the middle, be prepared to be downvoted into oblivion.
---
I worry that there is no one smart enough to think this strategically at Beth. Wastelanders is the shining hope though.
---
Ngl I’ve put my tent right outside white springs station 😂 maybe I should move it!
---
Just to clarify, I’m confused as to what persists between sessions on a private world and what doesn’t.
---
Also, what happens to the stuff you have stored when you switch to a public world?   Are you reduced to public world limits?
---
Good fuck this game. anyone who plays thisgame is part of the problem. You are letting big companies shit on the little guys and still get paid hope your happy in that shitty game
---
I stopped playing and bought Outer Worlds instead.   But I might have to come back for this.
---
Yeah, you totally need to chill out. 
---
It is just a game. I’ve played since Beta and it’s painfully easy to avoid people being rude or shitty. Chill the fuck out.
---
Wow you really trolled me by spending 100 $ on the dumbest thing imaginable.
---
The scrap box doesn't accept bulk scrap, it ignores it (and craft items like beer bottles &amp; baseballs as well). If you want to store or sell bulk it has to go in your normal stash. It automatically breaks down all your other junk when you add it but for bulk if you want to put it in the scrap box you have to break it back down yourself.
---
You are MORE than welcome to move on.
---
I have one of those I think, got the torch on the side like a colonial marine on alien?
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
Good example of a in game advantage that you pay for....
---
I don't know for sure...The thing Is that when i see the Fallout 1st armor i can't keep my nuke mines in my pocket...
---
Maybe they could have the pre- Trog map be covered in such radiation you would need a special armor developed by Enclave Secret Service and New Brotherhood, While they are sending you to collect a coveted large Factory and Military Grade Fusion Core, and once you complete the quest it changes the Brotherhood, giving them more outposts on certain servers or Enclave outposts on certain servers. While you have unlimited access to the armor to explore pre-Trog Pittsburg.
---
Other comments say you can kill passive players with radiation damage.
---
Not one issue here. Just remember that it won't take bulked items.  So don't worry about bulking things anymore.
---
I have F1 and I agree with you, or as an alternative require the tent to be placed each login vs. having it automatically place itself at login.  I believe CAMPs should take priority.
---
Then they should just use their private servers XD.
---
Yeah but you can play gtao alone ;)
---
What is fallout 1st?
---
And set our own rules, progress separate from the official servers, etc.
---
If I want an iron man (permanent death, zero respawns) 64 slot PVP server, and am willing to pay for it, let me run it. Or if I want a passworded 10 person PvE server with 5x lot drop rate and zero scrap weight for my friends and I to just fart around in, I should get that for the $1/slot/month average for similar games. 
---
Or, start a local server to play by myself and save progress locally. 
---
Ark really did it right.
---
Why the hell It can't happen to me? 😂
---
I believe I just did.
---
Some servers have a higher chance of Legendaries than others.  If you run the same Legendary farming route, you get used to the potential locations where Legendaries can spawn.  On some servers, you'll see none of them.  On a few, they will spawn at almost every one.
---
They fixed it in the last patch, but be safe.
---
Premium currency that can be used to trade with non premium players, circulating premium currency without having to purchase it. Equalising the opportunity to use platinum among all players. Not an equivalent model is it really.
---
That’s a really low bar to set.
---
You can get the keycards by requesting them in the white springs bunker command center after you join the enclave. Then an objective point will show on your map and you have to go shoot down the cargo bot to get the keycard from the crate it is carrying. This is toward the end of the main quest line
---
ain't that the truth
---
Uh, you can play 76 alone. I’d say 76 is more designed to play alone than gta o.
---
You have the combat helmet the marine combat is different.
---
Thank you, at least there's one person here who isn't a fucking idiot. It's people like OP that allow Bethesda to keep getting away with this shady shit
---
Well i already did this my self but i guess that the game is trying to save you.
---
What !?? Lol you can’t play 76 in a empty server until now and that requires fallout first
---
Wow! That’s awesome. You know it’s a big problem having to much money and finding what to spend it on
---
So, you can't explain how the fridge being purchasable with Atoms is "cosmetic only" as promised by Pete Hines back in 2018
---
Or... and hear me out on this. Maybe they enjoy the game and don't have a political opinion or industry opinion. Some people play games and enjoy them despite what other people's opinions of that game are.
---
I'd say the only criticism I have about the emotes is that the music doesn't stop when you cancel out of them.
---
Good.  Stupidity deserve punishment! Thanks to that sheeps the gaming industry will be forever broken since FOR THE FIRST time absolute corporate greed  goes unpunished!

---
&gt; Except the gas station didn't promise your get the premium gas with the regular gas. The regular gas works fine and doesn't do stuff like turn your car off randomly. 
---
Neither did Fallout. They didn't promise you free private sessions either. 
---
&gt; The airline didn't say you'd get the first class ticket for buying a business class ticket. The airline didn't intentionally make the conditions of business class horrible. 
---
Haven't flown on an airline lately have you? I'm average height, if I buy economy, I'm literally squeezed into the space with my knees jammed against the seat in front of me and I might be able to lean my seat back .005°.
---
&gt; The grocery store doesn't poison the store brand food to make you want to buy name brand food. 
---
Neither did Bethesda, the game was just rushed, I haven't had issues with the game like y'all apparently have, might be a YOU problem, and not a Bethesda problem. I'm running it on a 3 year old laptop I bought at walmart. No real problems here. 
---
&gt; We also know Bethesda promised cosmetic only microtransactions and everything else would be free. 
---
Wow, you must be really pissed at oil, tobacco, pharmaceutical, &amp; financial companies then, they've lied about the impacts their product has on the environment and people for DECADES! Is, is this the first time you've noticed that corporations lie to consumers? Boy, I hope you never find out who the President of the United States is, you might have to take a tranquilizer for that one. 
---
&gt; We also know they lied about the stash limit and how they could raise it any higher, because the scrapbox exists. 
---
Doesn't this conflict with your gripe about them shipping a broken game, just a bit? They used to have issues with stash limit, now, they've apparently overcome that problem. That fix probably taxes servers, which you have said suck, so, in order to limit the amount of people that have this option, and the resulting strain on server load, they put it behind a paywall. 
---
&gt; They are literally making you PAY to fix issues they caused. Why is it hard to understand that's bad? 
---
When I buy a first class ticket, I'm literally paying to fix the issues that the airline caused by cramming people into a metal tube like cordwood. When I buy premium gas, I'm literally paying to fix the issues that the oil industry caused by selling a substandard product. I don't HAVE to buy either of these things. But I can choose to.
---
If you want to two hit anybody in pvp, and take down anything short of behemoths, mirelurk queens, and sheepsquatch in 3-4 hits, use this build with an anti armor faster swing speed Grognak’s. Although with this build You could take out most anything quickly with a regular two handed weapon

Yeah that's the keyword I looked at for the list. There's also a list of headgear that has disease protection in water. Mainly, these are hazmat suits and PA helms.
---
Dude, it only takes one person to complain that you got the wrong pizza, you don’t need 10 people to complain. Also it’s a free market, people vote with their dollars, you have your vote, don’t be angry others aren’t voting the same way as you. I haven’t got FO1st, I haven’t bought any atoms but I’m still able to play the game, I’m not locked out of anything I need to play the game so I’m happy. Now if they turned around and charged for wastelanders that would be a different story altogether.
---
i wanted to try it out and see how it is 
---
my conclusion, fallout first definitely gives the members a shitload of advantages 
---
i understand the haters, but then i enjoy my unlimited scrap and claimed workshops
---
I like my Raider emote...but I don’t always want to salute..sometimes I want to be a mad raider
---
Or they could’ve been in on it.
---
Get carnivore mutation, melee gets most of its buffs from food. You might as well get plague walker as well if your getting the other 2 proximity mutations. 
---
Max out adrenaline and get ninja if you need more damage, as well as your melee perks. I personally prefer unarmed, gauntlets are very powerful and maxing out the damage only takes 3 perk points. With 15 agility you can use sneak attacks pretty consistently
---
 If you put on the sneak perk, or get armor with sneak effect it will be easier.
---
I dont use white knight until its time to repair, put on fix it good to get 200% repaired. Then take them both off and put on combat perks. My intelligence is 3 with the only perk I run for combat being nerd rage.
---
If you really wanna be capable, go bloodied. Bloodied melee is the most powerful build in pve. Full unyielding set with radicool perk = 40+ strength. Its easy mode, you one shot everything and the only thing that can challenge you are bosses, and even those can be one shotted if you stack all your food buffs and min/max your build.
---
I'm sure there are uses for a non-bloodied melee build, but to me its a waste of potential. Bloodied melee is the most powerful build, and it requires zero ammunition, and very little repairs because your encounters with enemies end when you hit them. Theres no tanking hits and breaking your weapons and armor.
---
Join the bloodied side its great over here. The other day I hit a ghoul for 34,000 damage. I hadn't even had all my melee damage steaks yet.
---
Wait until we get more info on wastelanders, hop in and wait for it
---
Could be, probably would be legally actionable if it wasn't...I would join the chorus if it turns out to be... but right now that is at best speculative and wishful thinking on the part of everyone who wants to see this game fail...as of right now, as far as anybody knows, Wastlanders will be free and to claim anything to the contrary is just plain old wrong
---
did you switch to a 3 day old account to make a point or something? quit shilling for bethesda on alt accounts.
---
Your wording makes you sound like an internet troll, but I'm going to respond asuming you wanted an actual answer.
---
I have just over 480 hours is this game since the beta. I've been dying for a co-op Fallout FPS experience since FO3 released, and this "MMO" was not what I wanted but it still filled that void so I enjoyed it. I got the tricentennial version and I bought a couple Atom packs in that time because I don't mind cosmetics when they're also able to be earned in-game. I fully expected a buggy broken experience and I still could enjoy it because there's nothing quite like it in the market.
---
My point is I played the game, I enjoyed the game, and I still want to enjoy the game.
---
With that said, everyone who gives them money for this subscription is negatively affecting everyone who is against it. Think of it like a workplace strike - strikers refuse to work until they are treated/paid more fairly. That is, until other people referred to as "scabs" come in and fill those workers' positions without demanding management to change, which ruins the whole point of the strike. In our scenario, subscribers=scabs. People get upset with subscribers because they're plugging the wound that we're trying to make Bethesda feel.
---
Subscribing is actively supporting Bethesda for advertising lies. They're locking content and experiences behind a paywall, which is exactly what they said wouldn't happen in this game. And that's not to mention they added a high priced subscription to a very buggy, very poorly rated game, and simultaneously the actual content that everyone wanted was delayed. The way they're squeezing us for money doesn't feel fair, especially to those of us here since day 1.
---
All the bitching on this sub, everyone uninstalling their game and calling out Bethesda's scummy practices, this is the only form of protest we have in this environment. It's wrong that people are lashing out at each other over it because it's just a game, but it does stuck to see my favorite way to decompress after work has devolved into predatory monetization practices, and to be powerless to change it.
---
I was BANNED from this sub for trying to be a light of reason. Ban lifted just hours ago, but I guess the damage is done already.
---
I'd like to see Kentucky, especially all the way to Fort Knox. Another game I really like is called Project Zomboid, I'd love to see locations from it translated to Fallout, like West Point and Muldraugh.
---
A premium subscription service in the universe.
---
Except the part where wastelanders will come out around the same time as final fantasy 7 remake and cyberpunk 2077 which will give any rpg fans more than enough to love instead of their dlc. No it was definitely a stupid decision on their part. Now if they delay it again till summer when no games come out that will be genius. 
---
   Also on the note of outer worlds requiring two subscriptions. No it doesn’t. If your playing fallout on Xbox you’ve already got Xbox live. And paying a dollar for a month of game pass to play a complete game is much better than the 40-60 dollar buy in to fallout 76 and the 13 dollars subscription In order to get everything fallout 76 has to offer. Not quite the same.
---
They should really have a pity system like some games have because RNG can be quite rough even to those who are veterans of RNG games... I stopped getting them around the start of the month while doing both dailies on two characters. Going from \~1/3 to \~1/80 makes me thing I'm either extremely unlucky or something is borked up at times.
---
The only thing they'll expand are the monetization avenues.
---
Not to be that guy but still being that guy. Getting free stuff hardly makes a game more enjoyable in the long run. I've heard some great stories on people helping out new and low level players with tons of goodies and legendaries, but that on it's own doesn't make any game worth it.
---
I got it just to try out the first month, Also I wanted the NCR Ranger Armor.🙂
---
I've spent most of the time I've had a private server building up this camp lol
---
The timing was terrible.
---
It baffles me how they thought releasing it like this was a good idea -- especially off the back of the Wastelanders delay. 
---
They should have packaged it with some sort of bonus for normal players, whether that's putting out the announcement at the same time as Mischief Night kicking off, of giving normal players a sleeping bag which works as a temp free-fast travel point and some extra scrap space -- just something to take the edge off it.
---
 Hell, knock together an identikit dungeon and release it for all at the same doing Fallout 1st, just some spoonful of sugar. You'd think after seeing the responses to a fridge they'd have some inkling of how, what the's word... 'sensitive' portions of the community are. 
---
I don't have any strong feelings about F1st -- I figure they must be needing money to keep the game going, but it's not something I'm personally interested in, but nothing against those who like it. 
---
But after the bag, the rum, the bugs, the delays... I just don't understand the thinking that another PR nightmare would be good for the game. And they have lost players because of this, and they didn't need to, and they won't be attracting new ones. 
---
The current perception of anyone who doesn't play the game is that it's broken, bugged and all the good features exist behind a one hundred dollar paywall. That's not remotely true, but the truth doesn't really matter in these situations.
---
Wait for the DLC and play the outer worlds for now
---
Never thought of chess before. I have been racking my mind over this decision. Not negatively. "Oooop bethasdss being dumb, dow dow dow, I cant see the forest through the trees dow dow dow" no. Why would they do this when they *do* read the forums and reddit pages. They have computers and google news... this though makes more sense with factoring in outer worlds. I watched an interview with obsidian's team and they didnt have anything bad to say about fallout. Even after both took it. Nothing catty, sly or coy. They honestly are just moving forward so I see the only people being so bipolar about it(i.e. bgs or obs./ black or white/good or  evil) are the ones entitled enough to complain.
---
Good stuff :D
---
No worries I found it, man after reading it all I wonder what the treasure is!
---
Stable Flux can actually go in the Scrapbox, so it removes the main motivation for selling it (it's weight).
---
I don't know how I feel about that, tbh.
---
Oh I wasn't saying it was worth it, I was just saying that he doesn't need F1st, the community is already accommodating enough that he doesn't need it
---
four people attempted to attack my camp because of my NCR ranger icon.
---
At the end of the day I am more shocked at how people have received this game and their take on the atom shop as a whole. FO4 was a hated hot mess until Nuka World came out and then everyone came circle jerking it as the best FO ever. And FO4 was not without controversy with the creation club. Which let us be honest was a preview of the atom shop.   
---
Yet so many people act shocked and surprised by their actions. Those that got FO76 knew what we were getting into, we knew it would be a hot mess day one until a huge DLC came in as that seems the only time they really consolidate bugs and squash them. We all knew they were going to monetize, yet there are people that are trying to cause such a disturbance that is not warranted using false info, youtuber lies, and things taken out of context.
---
Wear that ban as a badge of honor my friend. Something Bethesda doesn’t have. As there is no honor among thieves.
---
I appreciate the understanding.  And you're right, sometimes it seems like people get penalized for "not choosing a side".
---
It's like buying a BMW just to drive like an idiot with anger problems in order to keep up the stereotype where everyone who drives a BMW is a terrible driver.   
---
   
---
Its also completely true that BMW owners are bad drivers, but that's not the point
---
A membership might have been accepted if it didn't include p2w elements.
---
People is really nice. But nowadays this griefing problem has been increasing. You don't play the game?
---
I haven't had any bugs or crashes or anything negative performance wise in ages I'm talking months
---
I could see this happening in the next year or 2 if they are able to keep making money/growing active user base
---
Thanks man but Im on PC.
---
What about Intelligence? Does that not help?
---
Melee is good with the right perks and mutations (i.e. Twisted Muscles, Talons, Martial Artist), while ranged is good (i.e. Cameleon, Concentrated fire).
---
I have a bloodied swing speed Mole Gauntlet that hits 4k dam. really good but I also have a bloodied lever action that hits 2k but I can stay away from danger.
---
Good. Honestly if you're so brain dead you're gonna keep giving Bethesda money for this game you deserve to be greiefed.
---
I like to believe that people from Bethesda will come to my front door like publishers clearing house and hand me flowers and a big check when I hit 7600.
---
Wow, that's pretty bad on the mods' part, any sub drowning out criticism is a bad sign of corporate meddling. Either that or it's easier to just plug their ears and convince themselves that Todd can do no wrong, fucking Stockholm syndrome after how shit this game has been since launch.
---
yeah 
---
people need to get angry at Bethesda 
---
not random people
---
Holy shit you idiot. 
---
A company needs to survive, business models change. This is the first lesson you learn in Economics in HIGH SCHOOL you little child. 
---
The PLAYER BASE demanded a fridge, the company couldn't release it without PAYING their employees to make it, thus payment of Atoms for a service. 
---
I have answered all your questions as if I were talking to a mentally handicapped 7 year old. If you can't fathom how the world works I suggest graduating a few more grades. 
---
Or maybe try out Google and educate yourself, fool.
---
Yikes
---
To me, the biggest advantage of the scrap box is the ability to store immense quantities of scrap to make ammo. Right now, most command builds have bandoleer 2 to carry 10,000+ rounds of .45 or 5.56. They aren't using all of that at once, but they cannot put it in their stash because of how much weight it would be without the perks. 
---
With the scrap box, you can put several Lucky Hole runs worth of lead, plus steel, cloth, and acid and craft ammo on demand at benches. It frees up 2 perk cards that can now go towards DPS.
---
Never flown on a plane. So basically what your saying is everyone else lies so it's okay. This is what I'm talking about. Normalization.
---
So if a bunch of people with the membership join the same server and it DOES cause issues, the servers will perform worse than they already do, meaning they are essentially making more opportunities for their game to break. If they DON'T cause issues, they lied. 
---
"ALL CONTENT WILL BE FREE"
---
Bethesda themselves have said they have went back on their promise. Of course they didn't phrase it that way. "We changed the plan because the plan had to evolve".
---
It just wouldn't be Fallout if the bombs didn't drop on October 23rd
---
Good. Shame them for how pathetic they are
---
It is fixed. I have personally done tests both before and after the patch as well as a few others.
---
This is the key.  I personally believe they know the game is dying.  Every update has been met with lukewarm sentiment.  Raids sucked.  NW was good but theh cant keep it good.  I think wasterlanders is their last hurrah that's why it's taking so long.  They arwnt really interested in gaining a new playerbase they have skeleton crew.  They need tk finish wasterlanders as if they didnt it would be terrible and they already pushed resources into it.  And the engine is so old and outdated I can garuntee they dont have long term plans with this. 
---
Sl what do you do when your game is dying, you cant seem to put any sort if meaningful content in, you cant program it to be free from bugs? You bleed your hardcore fans.  They dont give a shit that no one new is coming back they are doing the last ditch effort to milk who is left before they launch wasterlanders and ditch the project.  They will leave a few people on it just enough for maintenance and the last 5% of die hard fans and make a small but steady stream of income while they focus on their newer stuff. 
---
Problem they didnt foresee or think about I'd the brand being utterly destroyed which will effect the bottom line in the future.  Someone high up must not care about long term gains and is making a quick exit and wants tk cash out, or is just an idiot
---
He's right you know, IF you're going to commit tax evasion or outright fraud: Do it for tens or hundreds of millions (or more!) and in the worst case you'll get offered a deal where you pay "part" of what you scammed the government out of back to them.
---
Extra + those deals involve keeping a clean record! No conviction!
---
Whereas if you do it for a small amount, say tens of thousands at most, they wont offer you a deal, take you to court, you end up with a record and fines far higher than what you originally owed.
---
That is just how things work in this world.  
---

---
I could always hold onto that loot for you though if you are worried about it. -raider smirk-
---
Why do they bother? They know they can’t damage it, you should just stand there doing the robot emote until they get bored and leave. Lol
---
I'd buy Atoms whenever they had them on sale, which was maybe every couple months.  For $8.30/mo, I felt I basically locked in a fair price for them all year, support the game, and get a few little trinkets to go with it.
---
I could do without those.  Private servers are nice, but they lack the spontaneity of the public ones.  The TENT is a nice feature that provides more flexibility in where you place your actual CAMP, but I got by for almost a year without it.  The Scrapbox is a more controversial feature, and I wouldn't hesitate to say that it changed the way I approach loot.  Now, I have no reason not to loot everything, like I did in Fallout 4.  The Scrapbox changes the game for the better, which is why I would have zero objection with giving it to everyone.
---
Maybe, idk why you said that. Do you not have cognitive deduction and reasoning skills?
---
Maybe they could have a dead money sort of mission in game where a major scavenger group in Kentucky sends you to fort Knox for the gold, but the bots and sych have gone crazy and with all the stuff it makes it a very tough mission. West point could be called Gardner military academy, because Gardner is an homage to the first graduate.
---
In poland it cost 500 PLN (Around 132 Dolars) while the averange income is much below US... Fuck those greedy bastards.
---
How do you identify hot server? By random testing, then hopping? Sry, im not english.
---
Actually you can. If you look at what it provides and you notice it gives multiple quality of life benefits, you can easily come on here and voice how inappropriate that is.
---
I really don't give a fuck anymore. I was a die hard Bethesda fan, but the sheer quality of The Outer Worlds has opened my eyes. I have played that game for about 20 hours now with 100% enjoyment and 0% fun, a number that Fallout 4 came close to, while 76 could not even make that 50-50. So, even though I LOVED 76, I see hardly any reason to invest time in this downward-spiraling disaster anymore. Sure, I'll nip in for the free items and maybe a few hours for new events, but that's about it. Judging by the state of affairs I am prepared for Wastelanders to be a let down and a buggy mess AT BEST, provided it even gets released or is free when it does.
---
I think there's enough empty space in the existing map that they could fill in.  Vast swaths of the Savage Divide might as well be cut-and-paste jobs.
---
I wouldn't mind them freshening up the map with seasons or weather improvements, though.
---
 In poland it cost 500 PLN (Around 132 Dolars) while the averange income is much below US..
---
People hate what it represents from bethesda and zenimax. It's nothing but the $$$ for them
---
Oh man your right eat dicks though cool 😁
---
Damn opinions cost money now.
---
Even if you factor tax, the price is off. 
---
In the case of Australia, without tax, it's $163.63 AUD. However the current exchange rate would make the $100 USD $146.58 AUD. 
---
There's $17.05 AUD worth of greed not accounted for.
---
Some of the stuff was already included in the base game, but was taken out.. then later included in fallout 1st.  For example, the fast travel mat
---
Sucks. 
---
Not saying anyone deserves to get harrassed in game. It's a game. If anyone should be the target of ire, it's the company. Not players. 
---
But sadly, that armor, though iconic, is going to stand out to people who are pissed off on the servers.
---
Let me get this straight... Some of you actually paid for this bullshit? After everything that's gone down you STILL decided "Hmm, yes, it's one of the shittiest things a company has done to its consumer base but fuck it trolololololol. Skins! Trolololol. Private instances where I have to be online to host trolololololol."
---
Just... Wow. No wonder the industry is turning to shit.
---
I mean that's why I want it by year 3, maybe quarter two or three, because that would be time to fill in the map with main wastelanders stuff.
---
They stop working after the sub is up, you can buy it for a month and instantly cancel it and still have access for tye month. This is how I do it.
---
I know I'd hate to dry swallow a live hedgehog. I dont need to try it to know that. 
---
But I can be pissed when a company I've already paid $60 tells me that I have to get swallowing if I want to keep playing.
---
I agree with you, and I will only buy it next year once it comes out on Steam. Just a quick thing tho, it was the publishers (Private Division) decision over Obsidians heads to do the exclusivity, the people at Obsidian where not amused.
---
Only by comparing the same route and the results, really.  I used to have a route that went from Watoga to Harper's Ferry along the freeway.  On a hot server, I might bump into 6-10 Legendaries on the way, either along the road or slightly off of it.  That's very rare, though.
---
You might also be on a good server if you find a Legendary at West-Tek whenever the enemies respawn there.
---
Seems safe now. I am putting it in scrap box. But it's always a liiiiiiitle bit of a crap shoot so I still keep some on a mule just in case. 
---
Since you can't store bulk it's fairly easy to just make as much bulk as you want to reserve and just save that. 
---
That being said, I'm personally putting all new scrap in there and haven't run into any issues.
---
The $10 a month sub has both the pc and xbox games on it (a bunch are cross platform a la SoT). The pc one is just the pc games exclusively.
---
uuh didnt the british pound lose some value? like a lot actually recently?
---
Who hates eating faeces?
---
You can't complain if you've never done it.
---
Ive been sarcastic jeeesh
---
Corporations lie man, it's already normal. Probably has been normal since corporations existed. This isn't new. If, y'all really feel that you've been harmed by this lie, get a group together, find a lawyer, and sue Bethesda over it. That's your recourse. Trash talking the game and the community doesn't accomplish anything. You're not going to get Bethesda to shut its doors, by bitching on the internet. You're literally screaming into the void.
---
How do you farm legendaries at say Whitesprings?? Launching a nuke and running the golf course one time doesn't seem very profitable? On public servers someone would always show up to refresh the ghouls.
---
I uninstalled fallout 76 to make room for outer worlds the day fallout 1st when live. That game is incredible. The dialog alone makes it a 10/10 for me.
---
Ahh is the combat helmet pretty common?
---
*INTENSE FLEXING OF BICEP*
---
Lol that's what i did, when he messaged me he said "fight me." Then I went third person and saw his firend with the minigun. "I see you're friend :3" And I did the Robot and Mothman dance while I saw the other two of them up on the cliff ready to kill me.
---
Furious kinda sucks it’s a mid tier but still good
---
They apparently fixed it with a recent hotfix but who knows it might be an idea to remove all the junk from the stashbox just before the next patch goes live. Bethesda have a history of unfixing bugs.
---
"I can get a good view of a T-bone steak by shoving my head up a bull's ass, but I'd rather take the butcher's word."
---
It is rare enough that people buy them for 100 caps from my vendor, but I learned how to make them and most can not.
---
We console gamers are going to have to get used to the notion of subscription costs like PS+, unfortunately. I'd suspect the next gen consoles will rely heavily on those online services. I do think that's gross and I'm not looking forward to it.
---
At any rate, I view this FO 1st thing as a complete luxury item...premium, as you said. Most players wouldn't need or want it, frankly. The only gameplay benefit I can really come up with is that in a private world you have easier access to workshops, which is nice if you want to gather ammo or cores AFK, but even that's a stretch because workshops in adventure are hardly ever contested.
---
Absolutely. And the actual game is fun too. Literally no grind required, compared to even older Fallout games.
---
I love the holotape games. Playing Wastelad was my favorite because I was playing a post apocalyptic video game inside a post apocalyptic video game.
---
You can smell the desperation in this post
---
Invite me!
---
I don't need to eat shit to deduce that I'd hate it.
---
Especially if that shit cost $100+ a year.
---
I can’t say I’ve ever felt the need to grind in the older fallout games. Unless you mean 1 and 2 cuz I’ve never played those.
---
I have to hide in the private server 😭😭
---
No, but I imagine it's very cathartic.
---
Glad The Outer Worlds is out because I don't like this game anymore
---
hey ya, i appreciate your comment. and i do believe day 1 players should get something since y’all did keep this  broken game alive up to this point.  but that was year 1, y’all paid for the game year 1, were in year 2, and free DLC is here soon. all the atoms and subscriptions should keep the game running with updates etc for the next year. to kept the game going they need money and what y’all paid full price for has come and gone. this is year 2 . either season pass, paid DLC, loot box, hook or crook they need $$ to keep a online game going. they all do it and this is the way beth chose to do it.  but in total i agree with you. your totally right. etc. it sucks but it is a business and “fingers crossed” the next DLC and patches and updates will keep going next year!
---
I wouldn’t drop a nuke for legendaries if I was solo. Normally I will go to west tek then harpers ferry and burrows the Charleston capital then white springs. I can normally find a good amount of legendaries without dropping a nuke. I would only drop a nuke on private of it was at Morgantown or harpers ferry and I would do thy for a large amount of flux components and flora.
---
&gt; You can't really say shit about the subscription if you ain't got it... 
---
Of course you can say it's shit if you don't have it. We know what the subscription comes with. You don't need to buy the subscription in order to find that out.

I don't need to be gang-banged to know i dont like it. Do you ?
---
I think October was very much a rip-the-Band-Aid-off month.  Bethesda has had months to look at how 76 was going to work in the long term and probably came to the conclusion that a course correction was needed that was going to make a lot of players angry.  It was invariably better to drop a bunch of bad news at once than spread it out.  That's probably the only strategy to its timing.
---
Honestly, a lot of people will tell you a lot of different things for different reasons. The game at it's current state is a hard sell. It's still laughably buggy, has no real meaningful end game content besides daily quests and vault raids that aren't worth the materials most of the time. There are very few people but the community is still mostly good (save the few pvp players that want to crap all over low levels because it makes them feel good).
---
 If I was able to talk to my previous, self, the one that was going to buy the game at launch a year ago, I would tell him to run far and run fast. It ain't worth all the trouble. Go load up New Vegas one last time and enjoy the story. Go play Fo4, hell even play shelter! Anything but 76.
---
But that's just me. It's my opinion and I know what I was hoping for in a fallout mmo. It wasn't quite this. 
---
 If you have friends that play, go ahead. But they'll all get bored in a month or two and since wastelanders was delayed until God knows when, you'll most likely move on to other games and forget all about 76. 
---
If you do or don't get it, good luck to you. I'm sure you will eventually anyways. You just might want to wait to see how things play out after the menagerie of lunacy that was released upon the community this week.
---
That's not how it works though with major gaming companies. I can't call Beth and complain about server stability. It does nothing. It does if we all call. How are you not getting this?? Yes , people vote with their dollars. This was a shitty money making move that people are saying is OKAY by buying it. We aren't talking about atoms. I am angry and IT IS JUSTIFIED. If more people DIDN'T buy this shit what would happen? They wouldn't do it again. Other companies wouldn't do it either. How is this so difficult ?
---
Lore wise infinite storage makes sense. Why wouldn't you hoard everything in an end of the world situation? I just wish they wouldn't have locked that behind a paywall. Had Bethesda not done that, and given it to everyone,  I think the hate would have been much less.
---
Survival for pacifists...
---
I was able to spare $13 so I got it out of curiosity. It is good for what it is. The Private World is nice and the perks are super useful. However, I did also get Game Pass to play The Outer Worlds and with trades I got Modern Warfare for super cheap so I have no reason to come back right now so I'm just gonna let the month run it's course and not renew.
---
Once I finish those games and when Wastelanders and Private World Modding get released, then I will continue my subscription, which considering the backlash could be updated to turn out different than how it started.
---
So since it's normal we should just deal with it. No thanks. I don't want Bethesda to shut down. I want Bethesda to make good games that AREN'T filled with predatory microtransactions.
---
"Trash talking the game and community doesn't accomplish anything"
---
Yes it does actually, if enough people do it. Enough people blindly worship everything Bethesda puts out for Bethesda to care if most of the gaming community thinks they are horrible. They can lie all they want because they know people will buy anyways. Which means the only way to get them to stop is to get the people worshipping them to stop.
---
Blatant lies aren't really thay common. Game companies might often exaggerate their products, but it isnt often that games blatantly lie to everyone. And if they do we shouldn't just sit down and say "Well its normal oh well"
---
Plus I'm clearly not screaming into a void. You are responding, tons of other people are responding to me, so clearly people are noticing.
---
Come on dude. Don't give this the Donald Trump treatment. There isn't some genius plan behind this all. It's just a continuation of the terrible and tone-deaf management this game has gotten. 
---
This is not some 4D chess. It's barely checkers.
---
What essential features ???
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHHA
---
I get the feeling fallout 1st was supposed to a background announcement. They delayed wastelanders which would of provided fallout 1st a buffer and left fallout 1st as the only significant piece of news. Zenimax probably made them push out fallout 1st now instead of with wastelanders. They have used good news as a buffer before when fo76 was announced they also tested elder scrolls 6 to give fo76 a buffer.
---
For a low monthly fee this might happen. 
---
Probably not but they still want you to pay up.
---
How do I reeeeach these keeeeeeds?!
---
Oh, sorry. Thought you were saying how enjoyable each game was to play alone.  To be fair rockstar did put in that option but soon as they realized that too many people used it to avoid griefers they required you play in public lobbies for anything that makes decent money. And they eliminated the option entirely in red dead online.
---
Oh no, I requested a refund 2 hours after I bought it. That was a year ago.
---
Thx for info, learned something new :)
---
Hmm should I spend 100$ for a private server of a broken game or 80$ for a complete game.
---
(Actually its 1$ for a month if you havent used gamepass before)
---
In Illinois if you are within the Chicago city limits I think there is also an additional tax. I say this because I recall hearing mention of some tax on entertainment based subscriptions for the city of Chicago.
---
Hit up the bandit camp near top of the world. Usually a set in the arena there
---
Honestly what i hear from the game is, that it is mediocre.. So i wait until steam sale
---
Private Servers and improvements to abysmal item storage.
---
Yes these are essential, this game does not need multiplayer to function, there is no excuse for not providing an offline mode and the ability to host custom servers.
---
And the entire reason there are issues with items is because of the shoehorned online that no one asked for.
---
Then why you post about things on the game without playing?
---
Oh I totally agree.
---
Why not? Is there some rule against it?
---
Great, all this waiting and buildup and a year later we get some talking robots and people can’t even tell if its new or not.
---
For fucks sake.
---
No but it's moral. I don't have anything against you, but for taking about something it's better to be informed about the subject.
---
Why exactly do you need FO1st to walk the map? I didn't realize I couldn't do this on public servers.
---
dafuq...?
---
I wish they would expand anything.
---
Remove passive! Enable full pvp! Let the civil war begin! Force them back into their beloved private lobbies! It's open season on subs! lol
---
I can understand that people want this, but they can't even get the game to run properly with the current map size.  I personally don't hold out much faith anymore for any sizeable future content.
---
Staffing isn't an issue let's be serious. Every fallout game has had this issue where they ignore any feedback. At the same time every fallout has been fixed by a modder who did all the work Bethesda couldn't be bothered to do and released an unofficial patch. The issue with fo76 is that Bethesda has never bothered to fix any of their previous games and has no idea how to fix this one. This game can't be fixed by a modder so Bethesda actually has to do the legwork and they have no idea or desire to actually do it.
---
The box! I feel like the meme *what's in the box?!* with that bottomless box you can stockpile all the flux in the world and never feel the pinch on your stash. Those stable flux each weigh a pound, and I strictly keep only 10 of each to avoid eating my stash. Bethesda may only view pvp as competitive, but why am I going to go to a base players camp shopping, when I know a 1st camp will be cheaper via unlimited storage.
---
 Ultracite ammo, serums, power armor mods, and some other high tier stuff all require flux. These players can more easily craft and stockpile these resources just by stashing their stable flux in the bottomless box.
---
I might be interested. I usually keep a Nuka-Cola T-51 Power Armor paint job on my vendor.  :)
---
Haven't touched the game since the release of Fallout Worst. Is this event at least interesting?
---
The point is the things you get with fo76 1st are being used as advantage.
---
1. Not exactly Dyer Chemical, but at least a stuck robot:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB0lvSmFisY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB0lvSmFisY) 
---
2. The Let's Nuke emote gets unequipped or inaccessible sometimes (it says equipped but doesn't show up on the emote wheel's customize options where it should). I'll try to capture this on video the next time.
---
3. "Craft Different kinds of Chems 0/5" challenge. Crafted just one "Bufftats" and Buffout, Bufftats &amp; Mentats got checked too, putting me to 3/5. Crafted a single "Psychobuff", both Psycho and Psychobuff were checked, 5/5. It looks like having the ingredients while crafting (Bufftats = Buffout + Mentats, Psychobuff = Psycho + Buffout) counts them. No video as I wasn't expecting this. Maybe next time.
---
Just because I don't personally play the game doesn't mean I haven't been following its progress. I do watch videos, read about the game, etc etc, you know. I didn't go to war in Iraq either, that doesn't mean I can't have an opinion about war. I think your argument is pretty dumb.
---
If you follow the UI from the PlayStation home menu, go to Settings, then Account Management and Account Information. If you check PlayStation Subscriptions, if it isn’t there go back to the list of account information you’ll find Services List — find Fallout 76 and it’ll tell you what you have, for me that’s Fallout 76 Tricentennial Pack but you’ll find yours with Fallout 76 1st: Base Subscription Settlement, you can select that to find when it expires so it technically shouldn’t renew if it it’s there.
---
However I have checked the feature of purchasing and extending and it confirms auto renewal which is wrong by what I’ve explained above if you haven’t found it in Subscriptions, what you can do to be sure you aren’t charged for another month is remove any payment methods you have on your account and phone PlayStation support to turn the renewal off if it is in fact on and then you’ll be fine.
---
Since I don’t have the funds or a payment method on my account that may be the cause if you don’t find it in PlayStation Subscriptions, defaulting auto-renew to off. I hope this helps :)
---
That's why im saying in the far future what im thinking is year 3 quarter 2-3, or maybe in Year 4 or 5 but that would be a big missed opportunity to not to expand the map.
---
For crafting mods for the weapon yes, the actual damage no. 
---
Intelligence is used only for things like weapon condition,  modification and repair. 
---
To really get the most out of a laser rifle you need to Max it's damage out out with all 9 rifleman cards and tank killer. You'll find that a lot of enemies (ghouls and mirelurks top this list) have high energy resistance
---
By far Anti-armor is probably the best legendary effect I've experienced on a laser since patched.
---
That is the second most popular place to nuke, so not a good place for a camp...
---
"I feel bad for Bethesda, and you should to. The team really does seem to  care (based off some documentaries ive seen and behind the scenes  stuff) about this series just as much as us but they just cant seem to  get it."
---
I feel bad for the *developers*, yes.  I don't feel a bit sorry for Bethesda.
---
A war and a game is different. Besides, all the people that I helped that came back or are new claim to like the game, so it's better experience the game itself.
---
Also war... war never changes.
---
Sorry I needed to say that 😂
---
I didn't know you could get plans for any raider armour.
---
Look up the excavator and X-O2 they both have plan locations
---
R I S E
---
its saving you from itself
---
Good! Don't buy this shit! Maybe the added cost will deter people. It's a rip off
---
Event doesn't go live until Tuesday. But from what I've read and the stuff that's been datamined, event is looking like a lot of fun! Some nice rewards like a firemans uniform (non-responder) , whitesprings jumpsuits and other stuff. Though there's theories going around we'll start to get teases of wastelanders since vault 79 recently appeared up North.
---
Maybe that's why it's not in the base game?
---
DM sent :)
---
Solid Futurama reference.
---
Yer a good man. 
---
In my mind, this is what the game is all about. So good to hear good stories. I often do such stuff. I leave bags at flatwoods, at my camp and often at lower levels feet. Sometimes it's appreciated, sometimes not. I remember when I was a little vaultling, how difficult it was to survive with nowt but a machete or pipe revolver. 
---
Kudos bruv
---
Yup. You can! Light/sturdy/heavy arms/legs/torso plans :)
---
This fallout 76 despite what the internet will tell you isn't unsalvageable but it was up to bethesda to actually improve the game and make it worth playing to those they drove off. Unfortunately they didn't.  Fallout 76 has the skeleton of a good fallout game. It could have been the best if they knew what they were doing.
---
What you wish, you make this all out as if Bethesda and Zenimax aren't both making millions of dollars in revenue each year.
---
The franchise had to move in some kind of new direction why not online I bought the base game super special edition and I've still got that why should I mind paying a bit more 4 EXTRA content when I would have probably bought the atoms anyway
---
Can anyone ELI5 this for me? Been away from the Internet and gaming for a while and not sure why everyone in this sub is so mad; something about "Fallout 1st"? Can anyone fill me in? Sorry for my ignorance.
---
Good. Could understand people giving it the benefit of the doubt at launch but anyone who now invests a penny in this abhorration is part of the problem.
---
Love the sudden dramatic nature of scorched earth
---
I have zero doubt Bethesda has a pr team using alts to give the game some good light. They have probably been active since launch.
---
Where did I attack you?  I’m giving an explanation for why the people that try to blame other gamers are displacing their aggression. If that explanation applies to you, that’s on you. 
---
It’s not about whether or not I agree with what they’ve done. It’s about 1. Did this subscription break any promise or contract? And 2. Does an individual player have any responsibility to base their purchasing decisions upon the majority opinion?
---
The answer to both questions is ‘No’.
---
Lashing out at a fellow gamer instead of focusing your ire on Bethesda/Zenimax  is like yelling at a customer in a store because you don’t like the company’s return policy.
---
They’re just another customer, like you. You do your thing and they’ll do theirs. But trying to blame a fellow customer is childish. 
---
Hell, I may actually buy Fallout First out of spite at this point, lol. I’ll be damned if one of you is going to dictate to me how I spend my money. 
---
Oh, wait.  I’ll just do what I always do and decide if it has value to me and is worth my money.
---
TL DR: IMHO... buy it if you have to (or waiy to see if it may be released as Free2Play), but ATM paying for it more than what an indie game cost, is not that worth it as it has blocked some basic content behind paywalls and have design flaws/bugs as if an indie dev (make no mistake, i love and play several indie games), most bugs you may find reading online about the game are already fixed (not all, but most), also as you asked for, just waiting for "next fallout" will be too much time to take it into consideration unless you can wait 5 or 7 years if not, just buy it.
---
\-------------  
---
IMHO, IF, lets say, you get it cheap, like under $20 USD, may be ok to buy (was/its selling as low as USD 16 somewhere IIRC), but only if you really cant wait for it been F2P or the Next Fallout.
---
 Is not worth buying if like USD $20 or more, the game has some BASIC features blocked behind a $12 a month/100 a year New paywall system (like for example: playing singleplayer i mention it since you played fo4 so much. Also this still requires a constant internet conection, this may not be a problem, but you need to be aware of it) you can allways wait to see if fallout 76 is changed into Free2Play, i know is a long shot, but waiting for next fallout also is. (F2P wasnt announced but "I BELIEVE" it should be released as F2P way before they release a new Fallout game).
---
If you can handle to be shown "some spoilers", is a MUST/VERY GOOD IDEA to go and watch some "CURRENT" Lets Play/walkthrough video, that is some that has less than 1 or 2 month old, so you get the actual game state and not the launch/early issues.
---
Also worth mention "next Fallout Game" may come in 5 or 7 years if lucky. and i mean a main game, not some mobile. also no i dea if that future FO game will be any good or not. etc,...
---
Other players helping you should be taken as playing on a easy mode, at least on the begining, it may be an amazing thing, or not, is up to your taste. So is good only if you like it that way. if you already have friends playing it, is a very good idea to ask them, when do they play/their aprox. playing sessions schedule, so you can weight  if you can actually play with them, that will be huge fun factor to consider, since you are not planing on buying Fallout Premium subscription.
---
If you enjoy Battle Royale style of games you will really like Nuclear Winter mode its fun.
---
Also content is comming all the time, don't know for how long or how much of that future content will be available outside the Premium subscription... but at least some should be available to fo76 owners.  
---
I hope you find this comment usefull as a diferent POV. i enjoyed the game, i come back to it from time to time to play a bit and see new content  
---
PS: sorry if i didnt link to the low price i mentioned, but you should be able to find it. or find a diferent offer. maybe a halloween sale or something... i dont know your localization.
---
“Some rich kid”. You know average age of a gamer is 35 right? And $8/mo is hardly a small fortune.
---
Being totally honest, I hope the game improves enough to keep a player base that makes it last 4 or 5 years.  But right now, with how this last year has gone, I'm not sure that's going to happen.  
---
"Missed opportunities" really sums up the entirety of this game in my opinion.
---
I will do the Robot emote while you attempt &lt;3
---
It's just an odd example. I don't think this particular example is P2W as it can be done on public servers. 
---
The portable camp and scrap box border on P2W. But they're basically convenience items. The servers running more smoothly for V94 would be a fine example of a major paid convenience or P2W.
---
If they make the scrap box availible to everyone it would cut back on some of the hate.
---
Was that in the beta? That's shady behavior on their part.
---
I told you what you can do. Get a lawyer and sue.
---
You know i keep wanting to reinstall if it got better sinse launch. But everytime when im almost deciding to install it , i read or see a video about what they fucked up this time. Its so annoying
---
yeah, but it's never good to loose hope now.
---
it's like protesting Trump by staying in his hotel.
---
if you're hooked enough to do this you'll buy whatever Bethesda is selling.
---
Only Zenimax exec's bank accoujts and Todd's dong.
---
How the hell is that link p2w? Lol
---
Can't say I've come across it, really. I don't plan on buying myself, but it seems like around 70% or so of our Facebook community have. I don't feel like torching them, though :P
---
Trust that no one who dislikes something would be focussing on it for a whole year, when the sole value of the product is dependent upon whether or not you like it.
---
Wow. Completely uncalled for.
---
How is that an advantage? Being able to walk around the map? You can do that in either mode lmao
---
Bethesda is doing what they always do when shit hits the fan. Their going radio silent. Pete Hines won't tweet for months again and the community managers have been pulled. Bethesda always does this shit whenever they do anything stupid.
---
Damn.
---
OP is grasping straws since their brigade has left, aka whining about something he can't afford lol.
---
This is really depressing. While I didnt enjoy the game, the few fans who did are now being hounded out by bullies. 
---
The few who keep the devs paid to continue improving the game are now all going to leave and no one will want to play a game full of bullies. How long do you think they will keep working on it when no one but trolling jerks plays it?
---
I dont support the pay scheme - I think its horribly wtong and shouls be a free service for those few who play the game.  However, forcing the ones who do enjoy using it to quit is obscene. Wtf is wrong with people.
---
Dont like it, dont buy it or boycott the company. Don't screw over those who do.
---
If only there was mods in the sub
---
Really? What I heard was good but mostly comming from pissed off fallout 76 players and my friend who didn't quite like 76, so I'm gonna wait and see too.
---
If I bought it right now it would be just because I'm angry about what Bethesda has done, and that doesn't sound like a smart idea.
---
Can somebody elaborate what's happening? Fo1 and fo76 are on the same servers??
---
Morgantown. Around 3-4 sets in the area. At the railyard, in a barn near mama dolce, (mind the mines) and 1 under dolces which you'll need the pass card in the factory. 
---
Also 1 at one end of the big bridge over flatwoods. Forget the name.
---
Loads of location vids on YouTube
---
If it doesn't affect your game play, I don't really see the point of ruining it for others. Do you also key cars you don't like?
---
While I generally disagree with the whole “fallout 1st is the worst abomination since ever (someone literally likened it to the holocaust last night)”...
---
You win my upvote for the tommy boy reference!
---
this is a perfectly fine discussion thread friend!
---
which part did you hate most? come on don't be shy you are among comrades in this thread!
---
You can tell the people pushing this narrative of "Kick their ass" have never played the game. It's really difficult to do so without the other player taking part in combat. Also on another note I just bought the subscription to see all of these people attacking other people and so far after 2 hours of going to events and dancing with the new emotes all I have gotten is thumbs up.
---
You're absolutely right as I was about to give it another go and then they revealed this pass and I just couldn't bring myself to re install the game
---
You dont understand a picket line do you? Just because there isn't a physical line of people doesn't mean they aren't there. And while I myself wouldnt target others just because they bought the subscription, I wholly understand why it is happening. No one likes a scab.
---
I'm not going through a legal process to get 60 dollars back thar I'm certainly not going to get back. I'm not even angry about that, I am angry that Bethesda continues to lie and people continue to buy. 
---
Lawsuits aren't the answer to this problem.
---
Plus I'm 15. And also people already have tried suing them.
---
Ok what ever you think. To me the things you get when you buy fo 1st are a in game advantage. That's all I'm saying
---
I bought it, love the private server and the stash box
---
That’s just not true... lol. Do you even play the game?
---
All of Wastelanders behind a paywall, no. You think people are livid now? Wait til they start charging for access to the Wastelanders DLC and see how truly mad a community can get.
---
I imagine that we'll be back to class action lawsuits for false advertising or deceptive sales practices. 
---
No doubt a bunch of people paid for the game with the expectation that it'd come with free DLC. Can't speak from a US consumer law perspective but other countries would find that kind of activity illegal. Much the same as the false discounting they tried to pull earlier in the year, that was likewise illegal in several countries.
---
There having a long hiatus till all this blows over, we might not see them for years lol
---
YAY, NUMBERS!
---
I know, it was just an example. My point was that a person doesn't need to personally participate in something in order to have an opinion about it, or to see that something is wrong. And I \*have\* played the game. Just not for very long.
---
THEY PLAYED THEM LIKE A DAMN FIDDLE
---
It’s predatory, employed by investors with half the company in their pockets, Bethesda has lost its spine and say in the matter, so of course it’s infuriating to most especially considering cut content is being sold back to us that was planned to be there in the beginning and would’ve likely been there if not for these investors forcing it out in the state that it was in, from beta and now.
---
yeah, give me some PvP im gonna fight 💪
---
Couldn't agree more. 
---
Totally get people sticking with it at launch and hoping for the best but there comes a point where sympathy runs out and you're just enabling the kind of practices that will eventually kill this company and continues to infect the industry as a whole.
---
War. War never changes.
---
Is everyone forgetting the fact that Zenimax is behind all the bullshit?
---
what
---
No. It was not. Guy doesn’t know what he is talking about.
---
A new Fallout game? First of all, we have to wait 13 years for the next Elders Scrolls and I'll be d***ed if you get - *continues angry rant*
---
It has always been that way.
---
Wait so what I'm getting at from reading comments, y'all think this is class war? Rich vs poor?.... People seriously think that people are getting targeted because they are **jealous** that other can afford it???
---
So if first is 12 usd and it includes 1.2k premium currency and a unique skin is there any value to buying it once to get the skin then ditching the premium?
---
communist money?
---
Dojyaaaan
---
The pizza analogy was yours mate not mine, I was just pointing out how it isn’t relevant to this situation, so in essence it’s you who does not get it. Secondly, the subscription has no effect on my or your gameplay, I can still play the game fully without paying another cent, therefore I’m voting with my dollars that I don’t want to pay for it, the same way you are and I imagine the same way must people are, but you are getting butthurt that some people are voting differently to you, I ask what does this achieve? Absolutely nothing, we live in a democratic society where people are free to choose what they spend their money on, nobody is forcing anybody. Thirdly Bethesda are a business, to create content it costs money, and that money has to come from somewhere. In the past this money came from charging for the game initially and then for dlc, they never added new content to the game for free. Now as this is an online only game it would be unfair to ask people to pay for dlc as i imagine it would be a lot of hassle splitting servers depending on what dlc’s each person has bought so now the the likes of wastelanders and nuclear winter are free for everyone and this content is paid for by people who pay for subscriptions and cosmetic items that give no competitive advantage to the subscriber. So yes I do get it, you’re annoyed about something that no one is forcing you to do, at it seems pretty ridiculous to me.
---
Right. If they cared *that* much about Bethesda’s business practices they’d vote with their feet and stop playing altogether
---
Lol that F76 reddit has a stickied Outer Worlds thread.
---
Kinda says it all.
---
Yeah its just you specifically linked a an example that can easily be done on any server. Server stability has been garbage. You need to pay to have a good server. It's a better talking point than this.
---
Nice i will keep that in mind aswell. How much does a crit boost dmg? With and without better criticals
---
Another factor for the price difference is the AWS costs are higher in regions outside the US, such as Australia and Europe.  And since these are private servers in those higher cost AWS regions, the cost is translated into the price structure accordingly.  Anyhow, just a possibility.  I looked it up and the costs to acquire AWS in those areas is higher.
---
Thx dude I found one ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

“American Company wants more money, fans shocked capitalism continues to exist”

My camps are by blackwater mine and when I got on yesterday a 3 star was flying around, white though, tried to chase and shoot it but couldn't hit it, then my daughter woke up from her nap.  Good game 3 star non hostile scorchbeast, good game.
---
Theyre legitimately paying 100$ a year just to get an advantage, anyone who pays just to get buffs that will give them an unfair advantage over others shouldn't even play at all
---
Search engines are your friend

🤦‍♂️
---
.... who? Literally nobody i have seen in any of the threads talking about the financial decisions has ever said that name (to be fair, might have missed it though)
---
Im amazed people actually bought that trash.
---
Yes, the mats were in beta.. do you play?
---
Yes, they were.. then they were patched out about a couple weeks after the beta start.
---
They could have implemented game mechanics that weren't so time consuming to incrementally increase enjoyment in their player base.  But they didn't.  I created a lengthy post a few days ago detailing this. Instead they wasted time and resources on buggy add ons.
---
Nice
---
No, we just want bad practices to die and throwing your wallet at cancer just makes it fester. Cancer has to die of starvation or be cut out!!!
---
It's not tax evasion if you ask and they give the OK.
---
It shouldn't really even be the company just the Bethesda publishers not Bethesda Game Studios cause the publishers are the ones calling the shots
---
Yep. Vault 94 actually works now.
---
Except bethesda now counts this as a punishable offense now :) so yall just gonna get banned. Cause now you can be reported for harrasment.
---
Too bad they pretty much removed pvp, I know theres other ways but it would be more clear in hardcore pvp. Whales dont pvp
---
Am from RL Appalachia and can say the only way this would be more realistic is if the 1st players built their bases on mountains overlooking the rest of us ~~serfs~~ ~~peasants~~ common folk.
---
I think it's going to have a bad impact on trading which in my humble opinion is the major reason people stay with this game. The good thing about having a limit meant that people only afforded space to stuff that held value, people were on fairly equal footing, caps travelled well and it was likely you'd get customers making the drive to go out and find valuable loot high but imposing limits to not completely tank the markets.
---
This is going to create the problem where you'll have p2w players with hoards of items funneling most in game currency to them and dominating the market. It's actually pretty ironic considering fallout themes so heavily on corporate greed and its ultimate demise.
---
Change your icon and youre safe, unless your name is same in game. lol
---
remember when everyone said “ Bethesda actually cares because they aren’t a public sharing company like E.A and blah blah blah they won’t scam us “
---
Zenimax is public traded tho lol
---
You definitely missed it. I preemptively bring it up because when I ask where they got their source from, Luke Stephen's name keeps popping up. I think this is like the 5-6th instance of having to counteract his misinformation I've had to deal with within the past few days, between here and Discord.
---
Btw, he's not some financial insider in the gaming industry, he's just a youtuber with almost no background in finance and his most recent source is 4 years old. It's a conspiracy theory with about as much merit as some other random Joe on here saying that Bethesda must be going bankrupt because they keep coming up with really stupid ways to be greedy and milk the community.
---
If you like a game that is a cross between fallout and mass effect you will love it. Not knocking Bethesda here (think we all know there are issues etc),
---
 Just saying it's great and I'm loving it. Plus it's not crashed or bugged out once apart from the random pulling a gun out irritation when talking.
---
Power armour also isn’t allowed btw.
---
Well that's something that usually 9 out of 10 people enjoy.
---
I approve they are traitors to our cause of putting a stop to a greedy bethesda.
---
I could see that. Honestly, if F1st just even gave the 1650 Atoms, private servers (true private servers, that allowed you to set it up as invite only, for example), exclusive emotes/outfits (no stat/effect bonuses), discounts in the Atom Shop, access to Vaulted Atom Shop gear, and even the ability to get Atom Shop items a week before anyone else, but the Scrap Box and Tent where standard quest items available (like the Backpack), I doubt we’d see this much backlash.
---
I keep seeing these posts and can't understand it. How can you be level 14 and already have an opinion about the community? I have 700+ hours and most of my interactions with other people were horrible. Players griefing my CAMP, killing enemies before anybody else has the chance to tag them, camping public workshops, crashing servers on purpose while duping, trolling and abusing other people in voice chat, etc.
---
So it’s the same as ESO’s craft bag? It’s all there until you use it or take it out, just can’t put more in?
---
Where did you hear that from?
---
You are the problem with Appalachia
---
same with australia, its called tax, blame the government no bgs
---
People gotta stop pretending Game Devs are their friends, man.
---
Exactly :)
---
Lawsuits are the only answer. Case flipping out on me ain’t gonna do shit.
---
Who is pretending? You? Ikr
---
This is what makes, (and I say this carefully) fallout 76 different from most other video game communities, everyone is extremely helpful to one another and it’s very rare that you come across someone who is only out for blood, you are demonstrating how everyone should act towards one another and it’s fantastic, good job!
---
Lol yes. I imagine the bundle will drop next week
---
A majority of what’s adeed to this subscription should be free. We asked for some of it, but not for it to hide begind a $100 paywall if you want to keep everything. I want to use private servers yearly, but $100 is too much to ask for. On top of that you have to oay your Xbox Live or PS Plus expenses.
---
It's obviously an advantage over other players if the tent makes travelling easier/less cumbersome for you. Come on, don't play dumb...
---
Minecraft has the better solution - you can gather all you want, but a given chest has a given location and you have to go back to it (the whole stash accessible everywhere feature has always been stupid). Also, you can get robbed in Minecraft.
---
Faulty base premise. You don’t need first-hand experience to form an opinion. While direct experience will allow a more educated opinion, it’s not a requirement. 
---
I’ve never been thrown out of a window, but I have enough access to outside data to believe I wouldn’t enjoy the experience.
---
No, they aren't. They still love and want to play the game but are trying to get Bethesda to change their shit.
---
But that isn't ever going to happen if people just keep buying into their bullshit and giving them money.
---
Its been what? A year now? And the game is still broken, and now they want MORE money for watered down services that other games offer for free or cheaper and at better quality?
---
All these people buying subscriptions is the fucking nail in the coffin. So many of you guys were up in arms about it but now that it came out so many of you instantly flipped "ehhh what can it hurt if I just try it?" 
---
It's obvious now to a lot of people the game is never going to improve. And everyone with the badge, emotes, and armor are glaring reminders.
---
The people griefing the idiots that actually bought the sub are not hypocritical, they are angry, and lashing out at the people that have betrayed them and signed the death warrant of the game they so love.
---
Worse, Zeni has sold a large portion of the company to outside investors.  Those are probably pushing these changes, either to try to leverage money in an IPO, or to pump up the value on paper to sell off their share.  They could care less about the IP, they just want their short term profits.
---
The economy of this game is pretty interesting actually, and I hadn't really thought the stash that way. There's a marginal case to be made there, but I don't really see the value in storing loads of flux and valuable junk. That's not good business if you're not turning over inventory quickly. Players still have to put in the same amount of time grinding to get the junk whether they store it or sell it. If anything the megastash may only make resources more accessible because the reliable sellers with the best prices have always been pros with an army of mules anyway.
---
People pay for an optional feature and crybabies throw a fit because they don't like it?  Sounds pretty childish.
---
Good. Those idiots deserve it.
---
Anything to mentally distance yourself right?
---
Not like they love the game, want to see it improved, and now it's just about a sealed deal that the game is destroyed with all of these people telling Bethesda they are right to behave this way.
---
What a bunch of sad losers
---
You know there is one executive pushing for this shit. He sat there and thought up a way to fuck over the players for another dime. Then came in to the office thinking how great of a businessman he is.
---
Once shit hits the fan and its a failure, no accountability will come their way.
---
I really don’t know how anyone thought it was a good idea to buy this service for $100
---
Well, a scoped lever with all the possible buffs hits well over 600 headshot on 0 DR. A fully charged assaultron head hits over 1k on 0 DR. I think max HP is 355 with life giver, buffout and the magazine that adds 10 hp. If his DR is less than 300, the lever can one-shot him.
---
I can tell most of the time what killed me based on sound alone.
---
This does nothing to make Bethesda look shittier, but just makes the Fallout Community look like shit honestly
---
They should try the Outer Worlds. It's like FO76, but its $60 once and players dont try to kill you.
---
It's also nothing like FO76
---
That's true but you need your friends to also not add assholes to their friends list because once a friend joins your server their friends can join it off of them as well. Of course if it works the way I've heard then they'll be kicked out of the server if you block them
---
Problem with creation club is gamers were being entitled and not wanting to pay for mods. Where as creators were pissed that the community didnt think they deserved anything. Under the guise of bethesda takes to much a percentage. Which wasnt even that high. Its just entitled people.
---
Got my COD MW yesterday, fair and fast paced PVP action, what a concept for a shooting game 👌
---
It should be there still it just got unassigned. Happened to my other salute emote.
---
Your in the fo76 sub. One of the worst received games at launch. Everyone and their mother had shit to say about fo76 being literally horrible. This game got a mediocre review and is literally free with game pass and your waiting for it? It doesnt bother me any but it just sounds silly
---
I havent found any bugs with the game yet and the story and character development is great. Feeling like there is no clear right and wrong decision is amazing. There are actually consequence for every major choice unlike every other game that says that. I think the game is really well done
---
How so? So you mean bitching and moaning on Reddit about something not being free because you spent ~50ish dollars 1 year ago and feel entitled to years of free additional game content is what REAL Appalachia supporters do? Get off your high horse and feeling entitled to everything you see you want. Get a job and pay for shit. I (and I know others) are tired of hearing whiny ass posts/comments like yours, grow the fuck up kid, YOU are the problem with the real world.
---
this happens, private servers or not. I've seen it dozens of times
---
Anonymous online hate isn't how you enact change. There's three things Bethesda listens to, and that's money, player count numbers, and feedback reports. If you're an active player, it would do the community some good if you sent in a feedback report on what you would like them to change. Regardless of what people say, Bethesda DOES read them. If they didn't, we wouldn't have half of our content like vault raids, player vending, or even brewing
---
It's a worldwide game at full triple A cost. They are milking people with a subscription.
---
And now if you grief me for it i can report it its now considered harrasment enjoy your ban:)
---
*tips hat*
---
Thank you fellow dweller. Just trying to be as good person as I can. I too remember walking out of the vault with very little on me, keeping myself crouched as much as possible, ah yes the good ol' survival days lol.
---
I always leave bags full of junk, chems and ammo I don't use on the porch of my camp, just don't get incredible traffic due to not being on a main road (I'm just north of Camp McClintock)
---
Ok so this is what you mean: I played the game but not for too long, so I get information and follow the progress of the game by the journalist and users on the internet (something really risky 'cause once I thought one thing was bad because I read it on the internet and then I love it when I proved it) and from that info I get my own conclusions. S
---
o is that what you meant or am I skipping something?
---
The traveling scorched walk like this.
---
You could easily solve that problem by not playing Bethesda games though right? The  “people who buy the subs are rewarding a shitty company” logic is true to a certain extent, but it doesn’t have to affect you in any way. Stop buying Bethesda games, then Bethesda can be a shitty as they want and you won’t know the difference...
---
Vanilla FO4 is shit. But the modding community is huge there with a gazillion incredible mods. I have \~200 mods and it has transformed the game into the god damn amazing experience I wanted. But vanilla is disgusting.
---
And the “NCR Armor” says LAPD on the chest.
---
&gt;You can't really say shit about the subscription if you ain't got it..
---
That's such a dumb argument. As if that's the only way you can get knowledge and form an opinion about something.
---
It's like saying: unless you've personally been stabbed in the face with a knife, you can't say you hate being stabbed in the face with a knife.
---
Keep doing it its now considered a bannable offense thankfully.
---
Hey there's a PVP idea 🤷‍♂️
---
All of these people doing mental gymnastics so they dont have to deal with this simple fact.
---
I've seen people claim wow syndrome, that they are hypocrites for still playing the game, that its class war and it's just poor people jealous.....
---
No people are just angry man.
---
seems about right tbh
---
Except it’s not an advantage, it’s a convenience, they aren’t going to do better at pvp because of it, they just get a scrap box. I agree the scrap box should be free, but to call it pay to win is just wrong.
---
It makes total sense now
---
That's funny that you think the players will destroy the game and not the developers/studio.
---
use VPN to avoid high prices, and stop making this threads, jezuz
---
I understand that people spent the money because their parents have it or they have it and dont need it or whatever, but by doing so, they made bethesda stick to the decision and continue down this path. 
---
If everyone stuck together and said hey even though I CAN buy this I'm not going to because it's wrong, bethesda would have been forced to change. So thanks everyone that bought f1 for telling Bethesda it's fine to keep doing this to their customers
---
&gt;What is your personal definition of ‘winning’?
---
Coming away from your gaming session feeling like you had fun
---
Cognitive dissonance is when you dont feel right with something. They are performing mental gymnastics to **reduce** the dissonance.
---
No, not really. Convincing people to stop buying their scams in the only answer.
---
That's shitty.i think the game is broken, and the idea a tonedeaf scam, but I dont condone that shit. C'mon, being a cunt wont help.
---
Maybe im just a anarchist who understands theres no such thing as ethical consumption with companys?
---
Its also worth noting that no proof of this has been provided in that original post. While I do think some trolling is probably happening in game because internet trolls will predictably spend too many resources getting a reaction out of you, I can't imagine this being the widespread wildfire of toxicity that is being portrayed. I also think both sides are contributing about equally to the shouting and name calling which should be pointed out as well since this is leading to a lack of a real discussion between the two parties. "Everybody is talking and no one is listening" seems to be the quote to best describe what is going on right now.  
---
I do however feel like Bethesda is partially to blame on this matter because of how little they actually try and interact with us compared to other games I play (The Division 2 and Vermintide 2). I feel as though they pretty often leave us with something controversial and then step out of the conversation with little clarification. We have to try to fill in the gaps too much with speculation on what their intentions are and how to respond to it preemptively if possible and usually it is too late. Had I known what it was we were getting last Wednesday I would have sent in a feedback ticket the earliest I could explaining why I think adding the Scrapbox and the Tent to the bundle over-incentivises it and leaves part of the community out and will lead to backlash. I feel like if they left those items out the worst we would have gotten is some ruffled feathers about the servers being instances rather than actual servers and the pricing internationally (RIP Aussies), not a class war within the community.   
---
My Opinions:  
---
Cosmetic subscription service to support game: Good.  
---
Inclusion of community asked for items that change QoL features: Very Bad.  
---
Pricing: bad.  
---
Lack of communication: bad.  
---
Griefing: bad.  
---
Name calling from both sides: Very Bad.   
---
Saying "This is what you asked for" when the community is obviously upset: Very Bad.
---
It's sad to hear that people actually buy this crap of subscription...
---
I'm glad the general gaming community is finally starting to grasp that video games aren't developed in a vacuum.
---
Can't hurt.
---
Release Wastelanders as a buggy mess too? Okay, that’ll help Bethesda so much. May as well release TES6 or Starfield too while they’re at it.
---
Gonna do tv ads? Billboards?
---
Thats so sweet, i love to grief people its so much fun, its good to know more people are doing it now
---
I suspect with Wastelanders DLC they will drop a lot of assets on the Atom shop that we have been waiting for as well -- responders, BoS, and more Raider stuff
---
&gt;You walk over to investigate and bam, their back posture goes from chad to gamer bent and they start acting like normal scorch.
---
So it's true.  The Scorched really *are* just a bunch of slackers with face makeup.
---
They're in the shelter until the rads have returned to safe levels.
---
There is a big difference, trying to stick it out and being faithful to a game. But whatever mental gymnastics you gotta do to feel righteous right?
---
The subscription is optional.  You can keep on playing like you always did.  Was the timing bad?  Yeah.  I think a great good will gesture would have been to give the unlimited stash item to players free.  I am very new, but for those who stuck it out since the game's release, they deserved a big ole fat carrot, yes they did.
---
I love it. Don’t have to deal with 30 kids asking me to drop camp decorations at their camp. Don’t have kids screaming at me to sell them a bloodied explosive weapon for 2 sugar bombs and a stimpack because they don’t have the caps. Don’t have to worry about people constantly annoying you to engage in pvp. I’ll gladly play 1st to avoid annoying ass kids and enjoy my play time.
---
most online purchases aren't taxed in the u.s and yes tax isn't included but even so tax on purchasing things is based off of the state and city you are purchasing said item in. like in peoria illinois sales tax is about 9% and there are some states in the u.s. that don't have sales tax at all
---
As a former anti-hoarder, I feel like I could build a yacht with all this extra wood, glass, adhesive and screws I now have.
---
I’m still setting a personal limit of 5000 per type, so the newbies will still get goodie bags full of springs, adhesive, etc. If 5000 isn’t enough of anything, steel being the exception, I’m doing it wrong.
---
The wheel is always buggy but switching weapons isn’t a huge issue for me, you press one button to go back to previous weapon, another press to switch back (PS4). How many different kinds of weapons do you use in a battle anyways?
---
119,99 Euro in Germany. That's 132.95$.
---
The irony of paying 300 for a game and calling someone who spent 13 a shill...
---
The souls community blew this one out of the water, all I've ever run into back when I played was angry 1-shotting madmen and people who would murder you and sit on your stuff in survival mode so they could do it again.
---
It's like buying a bag of crisps from a shop then going back to the same shop a while later and expecting more crisps 4 free just cause you bought the 1st bag
---
Nope, all the mutants and ghouls are where they are supposed to be. They are only in different position if someone was there shortly before you saw them.
---
That’s what mine says. That number doesn’t mean much, for commandos it’s all about the sneak multipliers. Add Adrenaline on top of that,  headshots &amp; VATS crits to really stack the numbers. 
---
Once you get all that cooking and take on some mobs and you’ll see damage numbers ranging from 400-1000+
---
That's totally fair and I understand why they make it that way.
---
this will be argued about until the end of gaming. but pay-to-win has nothing to do with 'winning' it has to do with an advantage that is not available in the free or base model. any advantage, convenience or otherwise. but defenders of whatever subscription or atom shop whatever will always claim the item or sub or whatever isn't actually a direct winning advantage.
---
Good. F76 needs to die so Bethesda can do the right thing and fix their engine and focus on making ES6 and Starfield actually QUALITY products.
---
What’s like minimum level for PA? The first time I tried to get in one it gave me a level restriction(I had to be 15 I think) and then once I hit 15 it said I had to remove the high level armor on it to get in(every one I’ve tried since does the same) so what’s a normal level where you can use the average PA laying around
---
Getting a message through to potentially fix the game means nothing in the face of a good deal right?
---
I think griefing Fallout 1st players is a bad thing too.
---
It's not infinite because it keeps deleting the contents.
---
So really, did they lie?
---
They break constantly. I’d advise you do lots of scrapping first. At 125% I can’t make it through 500 rounds before it’s broken.
---
I can't believe how many people gripe about other people pumping money into a game.  Money = more content, at least in theory.
---
I’ve noticed this on private worlds, which makes me think that maybe because of the traffic on public worlds I just never got the full amount of enemies. On the other hand, they also fixed the spawn issues with enemies who had been turned to goo piles, which may have fixed some other spawn issues in general.
---
Winning is by letting go and start playing outer worlds or some other game.
---
Hmm, I'll remember to look again.  I  thought I was pretty examining, but at the same time it can be so easy to glance past things.
---
Good grief.
---
P2W is getting weapons, more damage, higher defense buffs, stat boosts via a cash purchase.
---
Its Golden Bullets to one shot another players tank.
---
Having to walk less on the next login to go sightseeing is not P2W.
---
Well, to be fair, the responses are from community mods not really directly quoted from developers right?  Unless they can get a direct quote to give to us, I would take the phone game response potentially inaccurate.
---
No clue, but then again, I am also confused when people talk about "endgame"
---
The question is, why on earth would you even want it installed? Fallout 76 is a SCAM!
---
You’ve got to be a centipede to be able to try all of them lol 😂
---
You are Danish though? xD
---
YOU: &gt;Hell, I may actually buy Fallout First out of spite at this point, lol. I’ll be damned if one of you is going to dictate to me how I spend my money.
---
ALSO YOU: This is displaced aggression, and it’s a coping technique, albeit an immature one.
---
I believe you. But I have had people launch countless mini nukes at my camp and it did nothing. Maybe they didnt know the tricks you do. And I'm not a kid.
---
Never thought of it that way.
---
Maybe if I was a millionaire.
---
I think what people might mean by pay to win is something that gives you a notable advantage over other players. Repair kits, scrap boxes, a second mini camp, those unstoppables outfit buffs from ages ago - they're small but present things that make you just a little more well off than others who didn't pay, and that's kinda not groovy. 
---
If I can make 5 fasnacht donuts each time I log in, I call that a win
---
Getting banned off of Fallout 76 isn't exactly my number one concern on Earth. If it was, I wouldn't be doing the griefing in the first place. I'm already not doing the griefing anyway, never said I was griefing. In fact I specifically said that I'd much rather message the person and just ask them what compelled them to buy the subscription, but whatever. Someone dumb enough to buy Fallout 1st, I don't expect them to be able to read. Thanks for proving my point.
---
I bought it to avoid annoying kids. Best $12.99 I’ve spent. Will definitely get the year.
---
The only thing I think would be genius is if they purposefully released fo1st as is just to be able to change it due to “outrage” and come out on top giving us what they originally planned.
---
I.e. they gave us fo1st the way it is on purpose fully knowing people would shit a brick so they could change it, add what they originally intended(or stuff they see people want during this “outrage”) and come out looking like the heroes. “We listened!”
---
It’s actually a genius idea
---
The tent is basically an infinite supply of those junk teleporter things they added, the things that scrap your junk and teleport it to your stash, because the tent can be placed in most places (some places C.A.M.P’s can’t be) and it’s free to move. Other people have to pay for the junk teleporters or constantly find a stash box, not if you have a tent.
---
Thank you! I do my best to help out as much as I can. I didn't get too much help out the gate so I feel that extra need to help the community and I do it with pride! Myself, like a lot of other people in the game, if the old karma system from 3 and NV was still kicking I would be in Jesus mode right now LMAO
---
IMO private servers plus unlimited scrap is a huge advantage.  I think what's really pissing people off compared to, say, the ESO subscription is stuff like how Beth was claiming they COULDN'T let people have infinite scrap because of server issues.
---
Honestly if I wasn't neck deep in the Destiny grind right now, (and assuming the scrap box works like ESO craft bag where you still have access to your mats if you quit subscribing, you just can't add more) I'd buy a month and loot everything not nailed down to profit from later.
---
Even if they don’t expand, I wouldn’t mind if they just let you explore different maps. Same gameplay in different worlds, like this game and Fallout 4.
---
This will kill all hope for Starfield or ES6 to actually be good. I hate it, I really do. All the talented and passionate creators at Bethesda having to bend the knee to a profit first mentality.
---
You sure do like making posts to cry about this game. Just fucking quit if you don't like it.
---
Yep
---
Drinking most likely.
---
Thought you were going to get the outfit for free didn’t you?
---
Anyone that does this is 100% a cunt...lol I'm not gunna buy F.O1st, but I'm not gunna be a bitch and harass people that did. Bunch of geek cucks.
---
If you need someone to supply semi regular fasnacht donuts for the Slocum's Joe, I run a branch near Summerville. 
---
Happy to get my donut man power armour on and make a delivery, maybe some publicity too
---
I typically have one or two weapons that are my main ones, but I keep an extra or two in case I run out of ammo, or the guns break in battle. Plus some are just better in certain situations than others.
---
People are targeting 1st members?
---
I mean the point is to completely destroy Bethesda, and ruin Todd Howard forever right? 
---
After all, he ruined your life by making a sub standard game, you’ll never be able to recover from the shame and depression that 76 has caused you. 
---
That’s the level y’all have brought this to, have the courage of your convictions and crowdsource the complete downfall of anything related to this game. 
---
Otherwise you’re just pissing in the wind really.
---
As they should
---
Thank you!!
---
Don't have the numbers, but you want to hit as hard as possible and as frequent as possible. You only have six shots, so you want all of them to hit, and criticals never miss.
---
By uninstalling and abandoning Bethesda's games. They are now worse than EA, I love fallout but not enough to play a beta that's broken and now has an added 100$ a year tax for things that should have been in the base game.
---
So how many hours would I need to personally play the game before I can have a legit opinion about it, according to you? For me two hours was enough. I also played the beta for a few hours, so it's more like 4-5 hours all together. Still, the precise amount of time I invested (or wasted, rather) should be irrelevant. What matters is that I played it long enough to come to the conclusion that it was garbage and that I wanted my money back.
---
Haha, it’s good we share the same thoughts on this; I’m currently playing through my second character and I trying to get a bloodied build working, I’m only level 31 but I’m getting there and even though I don’t have much to spare I always do try to help everyone where I can, and for the most part you don’t get anything in return but that’s not the point, I believe fallout 76 is bashed far too much with regards to its mechanics and bugs that it’s rare light gets shed on its fantastic community. And I mean let’s face it, if fallout 76 had a karma system, I’d be right up there with you! 😂
---
Almost every online game has a paid subscription plan that gives you benefits. Half the people complaining don’t even have the game or don’t play it. Or they’ve never played an online game before. Heck, with most online games you’ve gotta have a subscription to have access to any additional content, modes, maps etc. or pay for them.
---
When does the event start? Today? Tomorrow?
---
Wow quite the list. I’ve been hunting for that machete (#546) for a while now. Any chance you want to sell it?
---
By looting, do you mean just picking up random items?
---
As to #4, many items used to be cheaper because dupers made them plentiful, driving down their value. With weapons duping largely fixed (fingers crossed) the demand remained the same but the supply is much smaller driving up the price. 
---
This, coupled with the ease of earning caps, drove prices to insane levels for certain rare items.
---
Dance emotes and outfits.
---
But you can or at least could when they first dropped. 
---
To be honest I never found it effective nor did I “win” using it so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ you might get shot trying to place it properly.
---
That’s not how the world operates.
---
Didnt know that!! Nice thanks!! Is critical savy or four leaf clover better? Or both?
---
Before the delay, I expected that they’d release some information about Wastelanders on October 23rd. I was even hopeful that it would actually gain some traction, and would draw more people to the game. Well, what they ended up announcing certainly got attention... The problem is that Fallout 1st really cements the public’s view of 76, and there’s no coming back from it now. What could have been a relaunch is now another excuse for everyone to write off the game. Even if Wastelanders is a massive success, no one except the small group of remaining players will know about it.
---
Ah that explains it
---
&gt;a decent deal on Atoms
---
Do you even listen to yourself?  Stop being a sucker.
---
Yeah like Fort Knox area, West point area, The Pitt, fallout 3 map, and stuff like that
---
No I don’t want anything anymore. I’m done, Bethesda can do whatever they want with this cash grab.

I did it with a buddy, It’s honestly very simple. You have to be a general at the enclave and complete most of the missions for them, until you begin “I am become death.” This is the quest that leads to the nuke. You have to have a nuclear keycard which are not to difficult to obtain, and then have the correct launch code depending on which silo you would like to launch from, A, B or C - i did mine from “A” (Site Alpha.) The code can be searched up online, commonly from “NukaCrypt”  that can tell you the codes from there. The codes change every week, I believe Monday is the day. Then you can head down to the launch site, there are numerous robots ranging from Mr. Gutsy’s, Assualtrons and Sentry Bots, with a few RoboBrains too. Once your down there a mission begins (I cannot remember the exact name) which will lead you what to do, just leading you through the bunker which is straight forward to follow. Then once your at the control room (The launch room) you have to defend the friendly robots to prepare for the launch, which is not difficult and actually no where near as many robots as i thought there would be, Maybe you have to eliminate around 20? So next you then decide where you want to launch the nuke, by first inserting the nuclear keycard and then entering the code, which you will have from the website. And you will have access to choose exactly where to launch the nuke, preferably the Scorchebeast Queen, but it’s up too you. The whole process took around maybe an hour to an hour and a half depending on whether you take your time. I highly recommend a Gatling Laser as them weapons will melt the robots in seconds. 
---
Hope this helps, but remember to take your time, there is no rush. Good luck! 
---
Also 100 $ is not 3300 CZK. It is 2300.
---
Sales tax is way better than paying a state tax.
---
Have fun. The Outer Worlds seems to be doing well.
---
But Todd said the community of this game isnt like that, did Todd lie to us? kappa
---
Wrong. The point is not to destroy Bethesda or Todd Howard. The point is to get them to stop lying and releasing scam after scam for 76. I think they could make 76 a good game. But they have yet to do so.
---
People are already trying to sue, they have been trying to since the game came out. As far as I know it's gone nowhere.
---
A 30 hour, non open world, budget ass space  rpg, that’s 90% dialogue is more related to fallout? 
---
If it’s so great why are you here, did you already beat it?
---
You can't destroy a camp simply by launching mini nukes at it. You need to abuse certain in game mechanics which triggers PvP. Then you can kill the guy or destroy his camp. You can't deal damage to a camp unless player is hostile. 
---
And as a general rule of thumb, the fat man, missile launchers and such are horrible for pvp.players using that are either trolling or don't know what they are doing.
---
Dont let the door hit you on the way out
---
It seems like it was broken so they replaced it (and removed it from our inventories as it had no animated icon) and I think the bundle is gonna drop next week
---
The map will expand over time as the game settles in and progresses. The first year of any online game like this is usually ironing out the problems. The second year is usually implementing broad changes and content. The third year on is when new areas and expansions happen.
---
The forum i am in.
---
So the general opinion is: its okay, but nothing special. Some stuff even bad or a step back in comparison to New Vegas.
---
So the technical level is, it looks kinda old.
---
Like a game from 10 years ago. 
---
The NPCs are just decoration, dont even have their own day routine., just standing 24/7 on the same spot. Companions are really funny and good. But Quests quality are a mixed thing. Opinion about dialog is also mixed, some is good, other like they try pretty hard to be funny or interesting. Enemies are not pretty the same over the game, not much enemy types. 
---
No real consequences. 
---
Gameplay wise nothing new, sometimes even feel clunky, combat system is meh, no real feedback, stealth is strange and doesn't work rly. Perk system is kinda not necessary.
---
Overall the game seems way too easy, skillchecks are like always passed, the value is way too low for them.
---
Overall it seems you dont need to specialize in the skillsystem.
---
Then all the bugs, especially stuff like Headbobbing, everything in the sky moves when u walk, where a lot of people get motion sickness. No supported real dolby 5.1 (the mid speaker is silent) and a lot of other bugs.
---
Overall an okayish game, kinda like greedfall. But not the RPG a lot of people where hoping for.
---
That works both ways. I wish people would realize that. There are other ways to voice displeasure without ruining the experience of other players.
---
Oh man that would be awesome! I just keep coffee and sweet foods that don't spoil along with honeycombs. My Faschnacht donuts go in the display cases haha but I'll pay well. PS4?
---
There's a thousand times more passion invested in the development of Fo76 than WoW. This is obvious in the quests, holotapes, design choices, nearly everything. WoW's devs are a bunch of psychologists who only knows how to develop addictive game design
---
You edited out the following part where I made it clear that was sarcasm.  
---
*’Oh, wait.  I’ll just do what I always do and decide if it has value to me and is worth my money.’*
---
But nice try, kid.
---
Throw a post up asking for it! The ground is definitely soft for good PR requests.
---
My theory on why Fallout 1st is all well calculated chaos by Bethesda: [Bethesda 4D Chess: A theory on why Fallout 1st is so damn crazy it's genius](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnt238/bethesda_4d_chess_a_theory_on_why_fallout_1st_is/?sort=new)
---
Sure it is, he destroyed your life, ruined all your hopes and dreams. Left you a shell of a man. Destroying Bethesda and Todd in court is your only option at this point to regain some semblance of normalcy in your life.
---
No they arnt. They do have investors though, which get a say in how their money is spent.
---
I like the sound of that!
---
Any advantage over other players that you gain by paying money is "P2W". It doesn't have to be something specific like weapons, higher damage, etc. For example, if there was a queue to join the server and you could bypass it by paying, that would also be "P2W".
---
To quote urban dictionary:
---
*Pay To Win. when you are paying for advantage which normal players don't have access to unless they either pay too or will have to grind very long (weeks and months).*
---
&gt;Fallout 1st is 100 dollars for a year which is about 90 euros, yet one year of Fallout 1st costs 120 euros in Europe, what gives? 
---
Europeans have more money than Americans.
---
I don't have any junk and my stash is always maxed out. That stash wouldn't even help me
---
Yeah Bethesda might charge him for the scratched paint.
---
Why tell anyone just leave, not sure if people will miss u,
---
I’ve had them land personally 
---
Maybe they only land for fallout first players
---
No one played it. I was never in a survival server with more than 7-10 people ever.
---
Obsidian's airdropping paid Liberators on us again.
---
I would suggest stop picking items up or stop storing aid sir looool
---
Looks awesome. Since the private servers were released I finally built me a proper base. It turned into 1 giant empty building because I was trying to cover up the 50+ water purifiers in the basement and that took all of my budget.
---
I did quit. 
---
 yes I do like making post crying about this game. 
---
It's bc I loved this game at one point. And I want it to get better.
---
until I took a missile to the dome
---
So why aren’t we using a more accurate term, such as ‘Pay for Convenience’?  ‘P4C’ is just as easy a term to use as ‘P2W’.
---
Zero aid too. All legendaries
---
That doesn’t answer the question I asked.
---
That plus VAT means y'all are getting boned pretty hard on the prices.
---
as far as i remember im using mentats/daddyo/daytripper/fury/psycho
---
im loosing mainly intelligence/charisma/perception 
---
im using heavy weapons without power armor and it works very well, most definitely not the optimal combination though
---
Thats one of the things I like tbh lol
---
Yes. 600 hours
---
&gt; a cross between fallout and mass effect
---
Ok you got me there, because I even liked Andromeda despite it's flaws and EA cancelling all post launch content (Kett sucked and story was lacking but the class system was fun). I will still wait because right Fallout 76 and Freestiny 2 are consuming most of my gaming sessions time but I'll probably buy it around Christmas time.
---
Wouldnt have bought it. It looks like some cosplayer took a look at one picture and did their beat to recreate it from memory i.e. not good.
---
That doesn’t work with the things they are offering. It would have to be restructured. I think it’s fine how it is.
---
Lol. That’s a stretch.
---
Yes i have about ten different weapons on me all the time, but for any specific situation I found myself using one or two at most, so switching hasn’t been an issue. Switching between different nades/mines is a pain though, as I have to go into inventory to pick the one, and no instant switching back.
---
Breh, you need to make an alt, jesus christ.
---
Yeah, I like when the state/federal governments don't double dip.
---
 You asked for this so we are happy to provide! For the exclusive low price of $31 (Oct 31st) it can be yours!
---
0% fun?
---
because play-to-win is the industry standard to describe non-cosmetic items. it's not like i made up the term. but that's why players who want to defend utility/convenience micro-transcations always get aggro with the phrase. and that's why this will be argued about until the end of gaming...and why anyone who points out what it means will get downvoted into oblivion.
---
I agree, I think most everyone here wouldn’t hold them accountable for any business decisions. I like the jokes asking where they are cause it’s funny to see them out making friends when there’s a positive reception and then radio silent when there’s drama I dunno why it’s so funny to me lol
---
You seriously only played it for 10days lol. Outer Worlds is ok but it's no fallout 76
---
It's not about the 13$, you damn simpleton. It's about the principle.   
---
I don't care about 13$. In a month I spend far more money on energy drinks.   
---
But also, these 13$ get me almost 3 months worth of Playstation Plus, which gives me 6 free games, which will all very likely be better than Fallout 76.   
---
On top of that, these 13$ are the reward Bethesda would get for a good product. But if Fallout 76 is a good product in your opinion, then your name must be Todd. Bethesda deserves no money for this shitshow of a game. And I'm very anxious about the future of the Elder Scrolls, because Bethesda will find a way to fuck it up. On top of that, I'm also anxious about the other Bethesda published games, since I could see them over-monetize these to make up for the travesty that was, is and obviously always will be Fallout 76.
---
For me reaching lvl 30 is the perfect way to see all the game and have conclusions.
---
But obviously you do what you do with your money folk.
---
I got a bloodied+crit? (I think) one from the purveyor so i’m quite happy
---
At lvl 5....
---
If you’re going rifles, pick up a hunting rifle. 
---
If you’re going melee pick up a fire axe.
---
He is using USD. He's converting it to USD because that's the global point of reference, especially with online purchases.
---
I'm playing Fo76 *and* Outer Worlds. Go me.
---
Fallout 1st isn't for me, but don't have a massive issue of what it contains -- didn't expect private worlds, unlimited scrap storage or a fast travel point to be in the main game anyway. And as long as they're not taking anything out of the game I'm playing right now, it doesn't really effect me. 
---
I play games based on what they are now, not what I hope they might be months later.
---
But I also buy them for fun, rather than out of spite.
---
I have 7 alts lol
---
Oh sorry meant to type frustration.
---
Most games : Pay for every dlc
---
Fo76: Free dlc, optional microtransactions
---
Greedy how?
---
In Florida we get a few days where they completely drop sales tax for certain things as well. Not going to get that with state taxes.
---
They only land if they have room to land
---
Ah, that makes better sense!
---
That isn’t my question. My question is what weapon I can mod on my main to give to my new character. I want to know what lv.5 weapon is the best for a low level when fully modded.
---
Shoot the wings
---
Yeah, okay. Bye. Have fun supporting the downfall of Bethesda.
---
I don't need, nor want, to destroy Bethesda because they are already doing it to themselves.
---
I was one of the lucky few who lost nothing in the end.
---
How does this not answer your question? Because you disagree with their personal definition?
---
Except pay to win is exactly what it is
---
I think that accuracy in discussions is important to move toward resolution. 
---
And why are we letting the ‘industry’ decide what terms to use?  Shouldn’t the community have more say in that?
---
The 'win' in pay-to-win doesn't necessarily mean that you will 'win' something by paying extra, but that you will obtain a significant advantage compared to people who do not pay extra.
---
The term is slightly misleading and I think it would make more sense to people if it was referred to as something along the lines of pay-for-advantage.
---
The scrapbox is a good example as it grants you unlimited storage for components. It will also make you have more available stash space because you can simply transfer all of your junk from your stash to your scrapbox.
---
The scrapbox clearly gives you an advantage over people who do not have it because it makes it so that you no longer have to worry about carry weight due to junk, which is a big part of the game.
---
Because people that have the scrapbox do not have to worry about carry weight when looting junk, they will naturally have a lot more junk in the long run compared to people that do not have the srapbox.
---
I agree 100%, especially in this type of game.
---
No he isn’t. Read through the conversation. That is his local currency. This is exactly why I said it was misleading LOL
---
Lol just wait until the glitch to enable full console access becomes more well known. It's basically sandbox God game at that point.
---
Haha camp building is more than a little difficult sometimes. I only added the lower level next to the ship to cover up a HUGE gap under the upper foundations. This took like five hours over the course of a few play sessions. I added the little raider lookout on the cliff for flavor, and wanted multiple levels
---
50 cents a day is SO MUCH MONEY.
---
Indeed. Appears we both are echoing the same sentiment. It wouldn't be smart to price Fallout 1st @$3.99mo at launch, add value to answer the competitors in 2020, then RAISE the price. Instead, you add value THEN lower the price. This draws new blood into the service while making existing members very happy. I think the target price come 2020 will be $8.88/mo. with some nice F76 benefits. If you opt to stay at $12.99/mo you'll get access to Fallout 5 and more. How does that sound? Just my theory.
---
Bit the US Senate already passed a bill that has languages describing p2w and none of it fits anything in fo76
---
How are we supposed to know what weapons your main can mod?
---
Mod either the hunting rifle or the fire axe.
---
Answer is the same, those are the best weapons you can mod out at lvl 5, that a character can use at lvl 5.
---
Well shit idk what to say now. And why in the bloody hell am I being downvoted? I swear people in this sub just like to hate shit.
---
I want to hone in on one thing here - your theory is entirely based on wasterlanders being *good*. IMO most of the new content has been okay at best or buggy/broken to the point of being unplayable (raids and now NW with exploiters). I did enjoy the Lying Lowe/Pioneer Scouts updates but I can't say they were amazing since they boil down to a few fetch quests, some grindable events, and two mobs that can't easily be one-shot. I feel like survival and NW were the most impactful updates since they provided different ways to experince the game and aren't just a repeatable thing you grind for a rare hat or plan but one was gutted/discontinued and the other feels abandoned by the devs given the rampant exploiting. 
---
I haven't given up on this game but my confidence on it ever being something greater is low. I for one don't really care about dialogue with NPCs so I'm not expecting much from wasterlanders.
---
you think fallout 2 is the best fallout? your opinion is automatically wrong is that’s the case. outer worlds has been nothing but a cookie cutter copy and paste of fallout because they know bethesda saved obsidians shitty company from collapsing years ago by helping them make new Vegas. (An ass game btw) also i implore you to get off the couch u lazy virgin.  viewing your profile all you do is collect ancient shit nobody cares about and play fallout. go outside and get a life pal.
---
because it's their term. not mine. pay-for-a-shortcut-not-available-to-base-users...isn't as catchy i guess. i find it all amusing how offended folks get in this sub.
---
No, he doesn't realize you're assuming he's using local currency, he thinks you're assuming a different level of inflation / CoL.
---
Hotfixes come after patches. Hotfixes and bugs are entirely different. Hotfixes are just quick one off fixes, not large patches. They dont address large glaring issues. And every online game has hotfixes. The better ones, more often. Hotfixes show you a team is paying attention to their game. 
---
Again, you are so bitter you dont even know why you're mad any more man. 
---
Again, you're so bitter you dont even know why you are
---
This is like a battlefield lmao
---
I don't see the problem with the membership just don't use it
---
They don't care. It's all about money. They are a company and they treat us like stocks. We can try our hardest to avoid the blatant capatalism but eventually it will over run the game.
---
"Do you even play the game bro?" should be this Reddit's new meta.  Have an upvote.
---
It's my personal definition, which you asked for?
---
Outer Worlds &gt; A piece of shit &gt; Battlefield 5 &gt; Fallout 76
---
I agree with the second class player thing but I do think it’s pay 2 win. The scrap box isn’t even the biggest thing about it. I saw a post where a guy was talking about leveling 25 times in his private server. Then I realized, these people are power leveling all the hotspots by themselves, farming legendaries by themselves, hoarding ammo and cores by themselves so when they go back to adventure, they’re at a HUGE advantage. That’s pay 2 win in my book. However, I don’t see why people are making Bethesda’s decision to go pay to win such a big deal, because *why wouldn’t they go pay to win*? Have they not shown since release that they have no integrity? Lmao
---
I’m not modding them at level 5. I’m modding them at level 50+ for my level 2 character fresh out the vault to use once he hits level 5.  I just want to make sure that is clear.
---
Nobody hates us when we drop our temporary camp next to the SQB
---
The game is still $79.99 here in Canada
---
I think it's 17 for Raider Power Armour. You can usually find a partial set at the Crosshair, a weakly defended Raider camp. The Crosshair is directly north of Clancy Manor, which is directly north of Cobbleton Farm, which is north of the red cow to the NNE of Vault 76.
---
I don’t mind the idea of paying for a private server hosted on their end, and the atoms are worth the sub alone since it offers more than the cost of just buying the  atoms. But I can’t get behind the QoL additions being locked behind a paywall in a game that isn’t free.
---
Not to mention most online games that offer private servers require you to rent them anyways.
---
Have you played FO3 or New Vegas?  Those are both terrific, if you can get past the aged graphics.  If you've BTDT, Fo76 might be worth a look.  Def helps if you have friends who play it, but I wouldn't say it's required early on.
---
The people you're harassing may just be keeping the game alive so that you can continue to have a game to harass them in. ::taps head like that guy in the memes::
---
Hope this subreddit gives you as few clicks as possible lol
---
Damn!  Such a glitch exist? Or, I mean, obviously it does but I never knew :0 I'll need to learn this
---
He says it is local currency LOL
---
He also says the game is $100 (his currency) in his country lol. Not $60.
---
that bill is based more around loot boxes, and how close that comes to gambling...especially to youth. but given that utility/conv items offset progression of a game i'm sure p2w in 76 falls under these lines: "manipulate a game's progression system... to induce players to spend money..." or which alter the "competitive balance between players of multiplayer games."
---
Fallout 76 is the meme that keeps on giving
---
You won't trust anything. But I trust them more than I trust their detractors. The kind of people I dont trust is the people who'd say "Our only option is let devs starve for 'goodwill or let them starve because it was too costly. Not letting them starve is not an option." Cause i've seen games that are happy to do those two options and I hate how so many times it just makes devs of my favorite games leave because that kind of corporate environment is downright wrong to deal with.
---
I'll counter by saying those of us that bought the subscription *know that already* we also understand that silo-ing a player in their own instance in an "MMO" style game takes time and resources and unfortunately those resources cost money.
---
PS4, and we've met a couple of times before I think
---
Same in Greece or 15€ for monthly
---
P2W is valid only in a largely pvp settings. 
---
It means one has serious advantages over other players.
---
Like a game with low droprates of item, low exp rates, low skill rates with methods to make them higher via paying.
---
F76 pvp is not that dependant on player level
---
The other p2w things are like giving the most powerful or at least a larger variety of items to only those who pay. 
---
People crying about f76 "being p2w" have never played a p2w game.
---
Both Tera and Blade and soul have became p2w. And i played megaten imagine which really was pay 2 win.
---
(megaten imagine has expertise dependant pvp, expertise farming was really slow and like most of the weapons were shop-only)
---
Fallout 76 has cosmetics and generally minor QoL improvement.
---
"Oh you like that Redgrin Grumboldt reference? I made him up. God you really are your Father's children. Think for yourself, don't be sheep."
---
Takes a scene about being original and thinking for yourself, slightly changes the name of the fake person given, and uses it for a Reddit name.
---
There's something off about that
---
I dont think so as it would be defined by the "reasonable average user"
---
Just realized we had. Found your camp by chance once. Made a cafe look inviting haha
---
To be honest, having now played Outer Worlds, I wouldn't drop full price on it. $30-40 for sure, but not $60. Thankfully, it's on game pass so I don't need to buy it at all, and likely never will.
---
So, they obviously dont mind getting items from the atomic shop... the bear costume was from there. Lol so they will beat you for getting 1st, but buy stuff from atomic shop.... interesting lol
---
I did. I lit it up. Never landed. Ive been experimenting. Tried rockets with limb damage. My vats refresg hero on just the wings. My minigun shredder all over. Never landed. Still waiting on this one
---
 Time experiment. They dont hurt me so i can sit here all day.
---
Secondly. They should land without shooting. They did prepatch
---
Open field.in the bog
---
average users in my circles think anything not purely cosmetic is p2w. if you are paying to change the game or change your ability to progress (unlimited junk storage/extra fast travel point/etc) that's p2w.
---
"The answer is don't think about it." -Fallout 76 players when asked why they still support a company that raw dogs them like Trump on Stormy Daniels.
---
Yes it will. That’s why this backlash is so rediculous lol
---
Yes, I understand. I’ve done this exact same thing. Those are the best modded weapons your new character can use at lvl 5 that you can mod with your veteran character.
---
Just do he main quest. Responders- head to Morgantown-&gt; follow your way to die firebreathers-&gt; then head to top of the world... keep following story. 
---
I don’t want to go in any further detail. I assume you are missing something in the above chain.
---
Brotherhood recon rifle
---
Exactly. In a highly used db you do more performance harm deleting records and fragmenting your indexes than setting a deleted flag field and dealing with that in the code.  Then dealing with deleted records 
---
 during a maintenance cycle. 
---
A few extra records for inventory will make zero difference.  Our intranet filtering log database logs every internet click not just urls, it is a security requirement in the nuclear industry. The db stores for three years and has hundreds of millions records.  The db is a few hundred gig, speedy, peanuts.
---
So.. let me get this straight..... By your ideology, we should kill people that fly first class? Or drive nice cars that are over priced? Hmmm interesting.
---
Somehow, I feel that the net sh\*thead quotient didn't budge. Haters gonna hate.
---
No it will it not. The gameplay loses a lot of grind with ghe subscription perks.
---
Well average users I know and speak to only think its p2w if theres some sort of serious advantage or paywall, such as good gear or exclusive games modes. I think we should think of other p2w examples such as BF2, madden and plenty of mobile games. If you're not putting in extra money in those game you're not going to be competitive in the multiplayer
---
It's just greed, not bankruptcy really
---
Why are you holding so many legendaries?
---
Fallout 1st? You mean Fallout Worst.
---
I didn't say it's any *huge* advantage, but it's definitely an advantage. Also it adds up if you add in other various minor advantages like that.
---
They said it would be possibly be added in the future. No details yet.
---
Random stuff
---
It’s zero advantage. Do you ever have trouble just walking around? Lol
---
I’d consider the backlash justified because the gameplay was meant to be improved (for free I might add) and not left stagnant.
---
and that's why this will be argued about until the end of gaming. because there's one definition on the industry side and there's another definition on the side of players who are defending micro-transactions. i don't really care. i just think it's funny that so many people in this sub get upset by the term. you are paying for an advantage if you buy the fridge, or if you pay the sub fee.
---
You can kill bloodied builds with nuke mines
---
So people using money to get the costumes got mad at you for using money to get private server? Sounds like they had good reasoning...
---
Second this. You can make a level one version and give your alt a lot of .50 cal ammo
---
Finally! Someone that gets it! Don't hate Bethesda you uninformed sheeple. ZeniMax owns Bethesda and is calling the shots here.
---
In short, gameplay will virtually stay the same, although people with Fallout 1st will have an advantage over non-members. So it’s entirely possible you can feel some ripple of a subscriber having an advantage, but in the long run I think the core gameplay for a non member will be the same.
---
yep, its great. Even my mom, she stopped by my place and I was in the atomic shop and she heard the music and liked it asking what the game was.
---
$12/month and $100 year is steep. I’m not going to buy it.
---
My main concern is camp budget, we all need an increase but it would suck if they only give it to the premium members... same with other small things we’ve been wanting. If that happens I’ll actually be pissed about fallout 1st.
---
Honestly I think the game peaked right before they redid the event system. It was more fun, easier to get legendaries, find variety with events while exploring etc. That update really sucked. 
---
Before that update, I struggled joining friends worlds bc servers were full. Ever since that update it hasn’t been an issue.
---
I feel fine! I have fun playing, and I set aside money every month for videogames so it doesn't hurt my wallet. It sucks that they made it more expensive in other regions. It comes out to $9 a month for me after tax, so it felt reasonable.
---
I agree but I think the advantage argument is exclusive to first since atoms you earn by playing the game. I also agree that first is an advantage but not a competitive advantage so I personally dont see how its p2w. Its pay for convenience for sure but definitely not pay to win
---
Teamtrees. The team for the trees.
---
It's not a question of could you still do it. It's about the effort, and how long it takes. If you can do something faster and with more ease, than that is obviously going to be an advantage. I don't know how else I can explain it to you.
---
.. tells me how to spend my money...
---
Do you mean that making donuts is your personal definition of winning?  If so, cool. 
---
But everything that preceded that was talking sour what other people might be defining as ‘pay to win’, not what you define as ‘winning’. 
---
The last sentence did answer my question, so I stand corrected.
---
Isn't that in fo4, too?
---
Well what takes care of that then, thank you!
---
All I did was give something to consider. I haven’t told you to do anything. - imagine being against planting trees
---
I did because I can. Also freed up like 700 lbs of stash per character. Now whenever I make a nice haul from killing an excavator boy I can store everything without inventory management
---
I’m surprised people play out of their private worlds tbh...
---
If I was paying that much (which I prob will when they patch the scrap box problems) I win’t be leaving my private server.
---
The whole game is Survival mode now.
---
It must sting having some kid use your own words to point out your hypocrisy.
---
I'm sure a mature well adjusted adult like yourself has already moved on and won't feel the need to resort to name calling and other such childish behaviour.
---
EDIT: I WAS WRONG- THIS GUY IS MAD AF
---
I'm done with them too.
---
no. because those who take the shortcut still have the advantage over those who spend hours or weeks of gaming to earn those atoms. still p2w. any advantage for the user is a 'win'. but these threads tend to drag on long past my amusement in them. you're free to disagree. i don't care.
---
 No, once I re-read it, he defines winning as making donuts. That part did answer my question. The preceding portion of his post did not.
---
People grind to become better. Once they become better, they usually start comparing themselves to other players, because the meaning of "better" changes to "better than others". This is why people play online multiplayer games. People are still playing games like Counter Strike, World of Warcraft, League of Legends, because of the competitive element. If you don't want to compete, you can always play a single player game. Like Fallout...
---
Any kind of advantage sold in online multiplayer games, no matter how small, is considered Pay 2 Win. This is not my opinion or the opinion of couple angry people on reddit. This is the definition of Pay 2 Win. It is a simple fact and not a matter for debate. 
---
If you want to understand more, you can check the history of every MMO ever made. But the shortest version is that the ones that tried any form of pay 2 win were dead a year later. Because a game is supposed to be fair and there is nothing fair about paying in order to progress faster than others.
---
If you still don't understand how this relates to Fallout 76, then I don't know what else I can do.
---
You walk at exactly the same speed with or without the tent LOL
---
No it doesn’t? I still have to grind just like everyone else. It’s not giving me items.
---
Agree to disagree friend
---
Explain the value in throwing themselves into the Internet Hate Machine as a schadenfreude-fueled sacrifice to entitlement and disordered thinking.
---
I see no reason we cannot coin a new phrase.
---
FO76 released a new premium membership for 13$/month, or 100$/year.
---
Generally regarded as the worst decision possible, as it comes on top of a base game being originally 60$ (unless you get it from a retailer not bethesda, who will sell it for dirt cheap because no one is buying this game), and on top of Bethesda delaying Wastelanders, a content updated the remnants of their FO76 community have been waiting on edge for.
---
Yeah, no. If the game wasn't losing players, it would still have had that introduced. Why you ask? Because a lot of people playing = a lot of money earned.  
---
Bottom line is, *someone* had that idea, and that someone was going to implement it, whether the game was still popular or not.
---
So boring you played 20 hours in 3 days.
---
I buy atoms every month for like 15 bucks so this is a great deal for me. 
---
Private servers are amazing for workshops as i am a low level and usually higher levels pick on me
---
What about the children starving in Africa? Are you saying trees are more important than starving children? Imagine being against poor innocent children starving!
---
It has nothing to with being ignorant. I fully agree that Fallout 1st is bad, but attacking other players over it does nothing. It just makes you look like a jerk. Providence Equity and Zenimax are the ones who need to have our ire turned towards them. They are the shot callers and they are responsible for these choices. Harassing some guy because he wanted Ranger Armor wont get any attention and it wont change anything, it just makes us look like clowns. You know as well as I do that the people doing this are not protesting in any way, they just want to kick down to someone because they are mad that their toy is being ruined.
---
start emailing devs and industry publications.
---
The game was indeed getting better but they were far from flipping the game around. Wastelanders does have the potential to transform the game, but if theres anything I've learned playing this game, it's that's Beth (austin) simply cannot make content that is truly thought out, compelling, meaningful and polished. All content released until now is mediocre (even if it was 100% polished).
---
That’s important too.
---
The fallout franchise isn't anything like 1 and 2.
---
Liberators inbound boys!
---
USA doesn't have a VAT.
---
Y'all is a dumbshit
---
Thank you sir for using reason, and logic! People are jumping on the hate wagon not even seeing where it would take them. Honestly it's just because most didn't understand that this is not an MMO but has an MMO business model and thus we should have known it was coming.
---
The NPCs were here all along. They're just trying to avoid the basement-dwelling sociopaths we Vault Dwellers turned out to be.
---
I bought a month to try it out and have been playing the game entirely the same as before it came out.
---
I could be wrong, but I thought I saw 30.
---
The fact it would only be in private is what scares me...
---
What does happen when you go back to regular adventure?
---
I'm laying a lot of Blame on Zenimax their CEO was a man who was involved in a major banking scandal back in the 1990s and got off with just a lifetime ban from banking and a slap on the wrist. I have a very deep suspicion that the bastard paid off a few jurors for a Not Guilty Verdict. Not to mention who a few of Zenimax's board members are. And they are Jerry Bruckheimer, Cal Ripken Jr, and Robert S. Trump.
---
Not only for 10 days, but when I first picked it up I played it 10 days straight. I played consistently after that point, 1-2 hours every other day.
---
Part of it is *absolutely* part of the cost of doing business there - the international pricing includes VAT in countries where it exists.
---
The rest of it is absolutely because they feel they can get away with charging more, yeah.
---
I would not be surprised if even Bethesda doesn’t know at the moment.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but the survival tent gives you access to your stash and scrapbox, does it not?
---
Have you ever considered that some people might enjoy games that you don’t like?
---
I don’t really see a major advantage for farming legendaries.  There are other advantages, but that’s not one I see much of a difference with.
---
This is awful. Let’s bully people who have a different viewpoint to you... sorry but not going to join the circlejerk this is not right
---
Nicely done! I've been tempted to start a new character but I've helping out some friends so much that I can't bring myself to so it lol. And yes Fallout 76 doesn't get the credit it deserves, I firmly believe most of the people bashing it are those who haven't even tried it and are just bashing it cause it's not what they wanted. 
---
Back in August I convinced a friend from work to get the game (we are both on Xbox) and I told him that when he gets on to let me know and I would help him, well I did just that.... Literally walked him through the first 15 levels LMAO. He got really annoyed at first but once the dust settled now he is going balls deep into it
---
If it can't see you/it won't attack you it won't land ever. Also use tormenter for rifles- and enforcer for shotty. I have see several of them land normaly but they were fighting me.
---
1 - 3 are already answered, so here's #4:
---
Fear of missing out. Whatever the "new" flavor of the month is, people will pay top cap for. I believe it's BE Fixer rifles (among others.) Quad FFR Teslas, etc.
---
Simply delicious
---
Most games use a two-step confirmation, rather than a countdown.
---
Oh ok thank you!
---
They need to add a lot of things from Borderlands, don't see why not as they already stole the colour coded loot and put it in NW (white, green, blue, purple, orange) they didn't even change the order, it's the same as in Borderlands.
---
Wouldn't mind a last stand feature that isn't just you sitting there for 30 seconds.
---
No I saw it improve, it definitely peaked before this tho. A couple weeks ago when they changed the way events worked and limited them, is what caused people to leave the actual servers. Worlds were always full and the game was more fun with a lot to do. Since that update it’s been 30%+ less people I’d say and I definitely lost interest.
---
If they rollbacked to the old style of events (maybe keep like 3 public) and released some qol stuff for everyone (camp budget and perk loadouts for example). The game would be in much better shape
---
Nah, doing coke.
---
You’re probably correct.
---
There was a glitch further back in January or so where your camp could duplicate all camp items you had built (walls/beds/workbenches etc) . This would technically double your camp size budget used.
---
To be honest, literally nothing happened, you just couldn’t build anymore. That is probably how they will do it:
---
You will just keep everything the same but won’t be able to add anymore.
---
Or we just start using ourselves and they pick up on it. Virtually all the industry publications follow what the community says instead of trying to trailblaze on their own.
---
Yeah the 3 or so comments I saw referencing OW really shows that. Boy the denial in how bad things have gotten is strong.
---
The fact that you were downvoted for a legitimate opinion is sad.
---
Saw someone post it’s what you get from the event.
---
DON'T BRING ACTUAL FACTS INTO THE BITCHFEST !!!!!!!
---
This again...
---
*12.99 aka 13 dollars a month
---
Correct but OP isnt even at thy point yet (I assume)
---
“It’s not a tumour...”
---
I'm just speculating here, but I wonder if the delay of Wastelanders wasn't at least partially *why* they decided to do this. The big thing with this live service games is player engagement. They want as many players to keep coming back and playing as much and as often as possible, so they're more likely to spend money on the game. With no big flashy update to entice people back in during the winter season, those player numbers are going to drop, and that doesn't look good on the financial reports. So they had to come up with a way to squeeze out some extra cash flow in the meantime. 
---
Whether or not this ends up being successful remains to be seen. Clearly a lot of people have already bought the subscription, but is it enough to offset the people who might now never play or spend money on the game because of it? Impossible to say. Guess we'll have to wait and see.
---
Best thing ever.Make 76 a True Solo Game
---
PvP is dead. What was left of it was Stealtboys and Tesla’s
---
Interesting, I have heard the opposite from people but I appreciate your input.
---
Will still be picking it up though.
---
I think the timing alongside the Outerworlds release is the funniest aspect. There’s no way it wasn’t planned and they just weirdly and seriously believed it would be successful
---
No. Stay away dude. This sub is a cult, just buy a better game like red dead
---
lead the way.
---
Yes? So what? Do you not ever pass by train stations or red rockets while you wonder? Is your current camp not portable?
---
FO76 is a hybrid. It’s not a true competitive game like Counterstrike. All PvP in this game is optional. Therefore I don’t think your comparison fits quite right.
---
That’s even worse lol definitely not worth it
---
"literally nothing happened"
---
I'm not saying they are good right now, but don't you remember just how bad servers were back then? Server disconnects and crashes happened like 5 times a play session.
---
People keep saying Bethesda is greedy, which is what your uncouth analogy implies.
---
How exactly, are they greedy? Fallout's DLCs are free. All of them. How do you people expect them to run the game without the completely, 100% optional microtransactions, of which even the utility items give an extremely small, pointless bonus.
---
I've never bought repair kits because I have at least 30 better ones from the queen at all times, and to repair a weapon at a workbench to 200% is a literally unnoticeable amount of junk.
---
I've never bought scrap kits because there's a workbench within a few minutes walk at all times. Also the scrap kits don't even touch the biggest weight items, which are the weapons and armour you pick up.
---
I'm not buying the subscription because I have no clue how people are still having problems with weight. I have all the weapons I could want, tonnes of aid, and enough junk to rebuild my camp from scratch twice, with 80-110 stash weight free at all times. Again, a very minor, pointless bonus which is completely optional.
---
If people want to buy these things let them, they're supporting the game. You're not. I'm not. They're making sure that the people bringing us content are able to be payed and continue making us content for years to come. These people need homes. They need food. They can't live in the office and subsist on hate mail.
---
You don't need to do any of that stuff, just close the game and play The Other Worlds. It's way better and isn't trying to nickel-and-dime you.
---
You guys know that even the online pre-order price was just about $35 worldwide if you knew where to buy (legal), right? Atm its ~$17.
---
I don't know why everyone is throwing those prices in and complaining, it's simple, if you paid more than $40 for the game it's your own fault. Period.
---
&gt; what
---
Like I said.  "Without a thought..."
---
Even if your car was a Tesla most Australian electricity is generated by coal, per capita Australians are among the dirtiest on the planet.
---
&gt;  But the shortest version is that the ones that tried any form of pay 2 win were dead a year later. 
---
Except Fallout 76 has NO pay-to-win.  No matter how much angst you have that your mon won't cover the cost of your new camp tent and scrap box - it's *still* not pay-to-win
---
How tho? Im in
---
My guess is Enclave, since they have a direct connection to Vault-Tec. It’s POSSIBLE that a US Army (BoS) ID could suffice, but I think it’s more likely to be the Enclave ID.
---
Either way, this implies either faction could possibly have something to do with whatever is in the Vault, and I’m intrigued...
---
Where did I call you a name?  You intentionally took my words out of context to attempt to prove a point. 
---
You might as well cut single words out of a newspaper and paste them together to write your own article. 
---
You obviously got triggered by something and I hope your stress levels drop soon.
---
You’re amusing. Stick around, kid.
---
Yup, cause I didnt notice it posted.
---
You should wait a few weeks for ANY game that's hyped up. I'm definitely waiting to buy Outer Worlds until all the people who just WANT it to be good are done with it to see if it's actually good. Gonna have to do the same thing for Cyberpunk.
---
They could easily make a lot just from selling emotes that are not locked behind bundles.
---
Yea I know. I just mean it is not like it was made unstable by one player, because I was able to rebuild my base a second time over (for science, of course) and there wasn’t even a drop in frame rate.
---
However, if EVERYONE on the server had a larger camp size and swapped back to adventure it might cause problems.
---
Either way, I’m not too sure why anyone would leave a private server besides to check shops or do public events (like SBQ)
---
I killed 2x 2star legendary Scorchbeasts yesterday and they both acted exactly like a normal Scorchbeast (they landed when they had enough room)
---
I am. I’ve been using ‘Pay for Convenience/P4C’ for a while now.
---
Here's shots from Bethesda [Fallout 1st](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-launch)
---
Remember folks, if you hate anything obsidian made then you get downvoted
---
Late to the party, no cake left I'm afraid, here have a 🎈
---
Loading into a private server, is exactly the same as a public server, just with 23 less people.
---
The timers on static items are still the same, if you loot a magazine/plan/safe, the 20 hour timer is the same as public. So there isn't some crazy advantage. The real advantage is not having to compete with anyone else for those resources.
---
The junk stash is usable in either for subscribers
---
I’m sorry, but if you still support Bethesda at this point you’re either willfully ignorant, or don’t know the extent of their predatory practices. Go find something else lol.
---
Private servers aren’t free in a lot of games. Get over it.
---
I was trying to be discreet when I said "I found another way to entertain myself" since mods don't wanna hear any more about Outer Worlds on the Fallout subreddit and I don't blame them. And if Wastelanders doesn't cost me a thing, I'm playing it because Fallout is about interesting NPCs and quest lines that make you question your morality and Wastelanders is the closest FO76 will be to giving me that then goddammit I'm gonna play it!
---
Too funny but they can only attack thoes who dont go passive.
---
Games are so fucking expensive in Australia, I really can't imagine how pissed Aussies who bought the game are at what they got.
---
Thanks...where is a post to one prior of this? I dont see it.
---
Please explain to me how, having an unlimited scrap box is giving them an advantage against you? Its completely convenience, most of the game you aren't working against other players, and the part of the game that is pvp isn't affected by Fallout 1st.
---
&gt; they are very FALLOUT-ESK
---
Have we been following the same Fallout franchise?
---
Solid point. It wouldn't be unwise to put your chips on that number like every other person. But, what's the unrecoverable risk to assume that this is all well calculated on Bethesda's part? Why decide either way? Why not grab some popcorn, kick back, watch the show and let it all shake out? My post is a theory. It is a theory I am confident in. We seem to live in a world of 'what have you done for me lately?' no matter your history of success. 
---
Bethesda has more homerun's than strike outs. All said and done, F76 can turn out to be a complete disaster on their books. Or, they can do what they do best and when they do their best and knock this sh\*t out of the park. Only Bethesda really knows. I'll tell you this much, in any plane I get into, I generally trust the pilot wants to get home to his family just as much as I do no matter how much turbulence we hit. 
---
There is absolutely nothing wrong with hoping the best for a group of people who make cool games and [ open their doors to terminally ill children](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-07-23-todd-howard-reveals-by-far-the-greatest-thing-bethesda-game-studios-does) with no fan fare. There's real people at Bethesda. It looks like good people too. I am not gonna throw them under a bus b/c of a subscription service they're not forcing me to buy in game where they pledge to put the proceeds toward creating more content for the game. Here, take my $99 and keep making cool games. Even if 76 crashes &amp; burns, throw a party for those kiddos. It's worth it for me.
---
Do you play the game OP or are you one of the non-players who are part of the "campaign?"
---
West Tek had a mutant hound stuck in one of those orange boxes/carts.
---
The supermutant building across the road from Robco had a supermutant stuck in a sink.
---
The spawns do seem to be a little... Janky...
---
How do you give your alt toon a weapon? Asking another player for help?
---
Private servers have nothing to do with it to be quite honest. It’s more the QoL changes they are locking behind a paywall when you already paid for a fully priced AAA game. But nice try!
---
So if you log out of your private world, and log back in, say, an hour later, the new private world would be a totally different one?
---
It in fact will remain the exact same.
---
The change comes *with* the membership, not without.
---
At it’s core, the only new opportunities it brings are saving a few caps on fast travels with another free fast travel point, and the lack of stash space needed for scrap.
---
Theres gotta be a point people stop and think "should I really keep shelling money on this sort of thing?". I would think it'd be the train wreck that is 76 but people have a way of surprising you with how little they think of their time and money. Dudes right though, this shit practice only continues because enough saps buy into it.
---
Loloool. You grind for weeks and months to fast travel?
---
Why be discreet, BGS hasn't been?
---
Mistress of Mysteries.
---
All his dialog is clips from the Silver Shadow radio show.
---
Well deserved.
---
Dont think so. At least not yet. 
---
My pet theory has always been that they've gone heavy in the free support side and were big on announcing Wastelanders as way to avoid that. 
---
As long as they provide free support and are promising to eventually provide the features they liked about before launch, they are somewhat safe. 
---
Remember, "live service" means "unfinished"
---
So having the tent always with you means you get faster and easier access to your stashed items. Again, like I said, it may not be any *huge* advantage but it's still an advantage. Even if it just saves a little time and effort it's still an advantage that other players don't have.
---
Wait what? Is that pretty much what the year pass is or what? I dont follow?
---
Because the mods on this subreddit aren't BGS and I'm trying to be courteous and respect their wishes.
---
Junk teleporter? Tell me more please.
---
You have Xbox game pass tho its included
---
So much envy in this thread.  Just so you know, that crap eats you up from the inside out.
---
I hope that if Bethesda blatantly catches someone abusing someone who subscribed, they ban them.  Period.  Nullify their game license.  Whatever it takes to get rid of them.  That has no place in this game.
---
Nah, unless Wastelanders completely turns this game around, I don't think I will be back.
---
Welcome to the internet and Reddit...regarding your posts edit ending statement. Especially here, you literally got dumbasses here who sit around all day downvoting. Go peek at new posts, literally everything is downvoted to 0. I cant take most people here anymore seriously then this damn game.
---
If you could sue over anything changing and not going according to plan, the world would be a terrible place. I don't agree with what FO76 has gone through and all the lies, but they were never held to a contract.
---
My theory is a simple one. 
---
1. Wastelanders was unfinished and unpolished. It was laggy.
---
2. In order to make it seem like free dlc, you low key need private servers to run wastelanders because of the lag( think terminal lag )
---
3. In order to keep people interested in paying monthly you release content for private servers near the end of the month so that they pay again (all of a sudden private servers will have increased functionality "soon").
---
You don't give it your all up front in bed, you side track and keep going ;)
---
Ah awesome! Thanks for letting me know! Had the feeling it was something as simple as that. Will update my post!
---
This is awesome and makes me happy.  Well done, Wastelanders.
---
1. Launch Fallout 1st with Wastelanders DLC or ~a week after.
---
2. All players receive a Scrapbox, only Fallout 1st players have unlimited space, other players must complete x quest to upgrade the base Scrapbox (i.e. starts with ~150 lb of scrap space, each quest upgrades by ~100). 
---
3. Like the backpack quest, allow players to complete a chain offering players a placeable fast travel location with no stash box, no bed, etc. Make it a movable pulowski preservation shelter, fits right in with lore purposes and is completely barebones. 
---
4. Offer fallout 1st players the survival tent with stash + bed and throw in a tinkerer's workbench on it. (perhaps a quest line or 'daily challenge' series to provide cosmetic customization of Falllout 1st items (and preservation shelter for those without.)
---
Everything else included with Fallout 1st could stay.
---
One or two quest lines, and a slight launch delay, and they could have avoided a bunch of backlash.
---
Don’t know but when I found out how short Outer Worlds was I decided not to buy until it goes on sale.
---
It’s just unnecessary. I would not be able to progress any faster if I had the tent. I’m not missing out on anything. I challenge anyone to find me one person who thinks they would be able to progress faster if they had access to the tent
---
Gameplay wise I can't see there being much of a difference if I'm honest for us 2nd class plebs.
---
Those with 1st subscription have only an advantage with storing unlimited junk and an extra free tp point. Both of which dont bother me, This means they can store and collect unlimited junk then sell bulk to us in their vendors ( not a problem)
---
The tp point isn't an incentive for me as I can't fast travel anyway lol so i would be unable to use it.
---
The only thing entising me to at least think about subbing is the NCR gear but even this will probs be available to us non sub guys/gals  later down the line as the datamine shows at least 4 variants with hints of a bundle of three.
---
The only fear I have is the 1st atom shop exclusives they've hinted at, which may or may not include said NCR variants and other things we have asked for. This would make us literally 2nd class citizens even in the atom shop, with those subbed getting better QoL items, gear etc..  compared to us who havnt subbed
---
I think it’s a fair question, but I don’t know if I’d go that far. I believe there have been definite high points over the life of this game. Fasnacht, for example, was a really memorable experience that only could have been possible because of the structure of F76. I don’t think the game has always been bad. I side with everyone here, though, that the new subscription model does not bode well for the future of the game.
---
I like how in the atom store picture it's floating on the table, really highlights the quality they put into their atom store items.
---
DONT BUY THAT STUPID OVERPRICED SCAM wtf is wrong with u ppl
---
You suck
---
30 Mirelurks at one of the toxic barrels, while doing that quest for Grafton's Mayor.
---
Exactly. My play time is much more paceful
---
I did, mainly out of curiosity. I have bought Atoms in the past, but only for CAMP items. I don't really like the 76 version of the ranger armor.
---
It is nice being in your own world, but I still like the public servers, too.
---
YOU: "but nice try kid"
---
ALSO YOU: "Where did I call you a name?" 
---
Followed by the usual "lulz you got triggered" response that only the most mature and super intelligent adults use.
---
Stop spending money on it
---
That would have been a somewhat accurate statement before they added in a premium subscription service. 
---
Now's it could be classified as a subscription based MMO thats severely missing key features
---
Ah this thread is a refreshing change.  So sick of all the hate threads, and hearing about how people are harassing subscribers.  Thanks for trying to make the community better.
---
All those "FO76 is a cheap cash grab" don't have a clue about the huge differences between FO4 and FO76 behind the scenes.  In FO4 if you're not in a map area it's dead, nothing is happening there.  In FO76 all of the map is live, all the time.
---
What? Why??
---
Survival mode was fun and masochistically brutal in the best way possible.
---
There's something poetic about killing other players just to steal their junk, not because you're evil, but because you're addicted to crafting. You do it again and again, you feel the rush, and it all ends when somebody ambushes you in your own camp. Hours of hard work flushed down the drain. So you start over. Again.
---
I hope they bring survival back. I miss it.
---
The technology isn't there yet.
---
Are you asking me personally? I don't play the game so I'm not grinding anything at all.
---
I was reading up on this yesterday. Since Zenimax is currently privately owned, the only information out there regarding actual share distribution is what they've volunteered, so you have to do a little inferring to get a picture of the current layout. That said, we know for a fact that Providence Equity bought a 25% stake in the company in 2007 for $300 million. Then 3 years later, they invested another $150 million for an undisclosed percentage, though since it was only 3 years, they probably tried to get close to the same value for their dollar if they could, if not better. That means in all likelihood Providence Equity owns a minimum of 33% of the company, if not more. For comparison, as of 2007, Christopher Weaver, one of the founders, owned a 33% stake; it would seem Providence has as much if not more say in what happens with this company than its founder.
---
Wait a minute...people are actually paying for Fallout 1st? There are people who have actually paid money for that bundle of horseshit?
---
Nah...stopped playing this game months ago. Luckily I woke up to what this game really was...a lets farm the same enemies all day and all night long...all to gain a level that doesnt matter...that does nothing more then look cool on a map, and to newbies contest. I did have fun in the game when I started, ONLY cause me and a faction roleplayed a bit....but eventually most of us woke up and said fuck this. This game has a long, long way to go to get me back into it, if it even can, I currently have zero desire to play this game again. I am here still, just cause the fuckups and bullshit is too entertaining not to be involved in. Its mindblowing actually.
---
You’re blowing it out of proportion now. It doesn’t help you win, it’s completely convenience. That is all.
---
I've had a theory that Bethesda is actually Vault-Tec but I have no clear way to present it lol
---
Is it really only 20 hours?
---
&gt;It's 100% okay to shovel the crap back into their face when they are the ones to throw it in ours.
---
Its really not.
---
My friend just got scammed a couple days ago and I'm fairly active in trading. Just adds peace of mind
---
But it lets you store way more. Hence, you don't need to throw out junk when your stash is full.
---
This. Good luck competing with CyberPunk next year and the FF7 remake.
---
Why don't you read the fucking post before commenting? You responded within 20 seconds to a post that is 2 pages long - There's no way you read it.
---
You guys honestly deserve it. A subscription for a game like this is a joke. It should have never been considered. So many other games deserve a subscription, this isnt one of them. There isnt enough quests, places to explore, and so on.
---
Maybe don't blindly trust the Fallout 76 subreddit and try somewhere more objective like [Metacritic]( https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/the-outer-worlds), where it currently has a rating of 86.
---
If I could store unlimited scrap I would be set, Im limited to like 400 pounds if I'm normal and have other things in my stash, unlimited scrap is unlimited crafting without needing to grind constantly, they get more time to actually play instead of grinding three times a week, then dont even get me started on the stupid tent thing
---
There's some stuff on the wiki regarding Vault 79 and it holding "The Treasure Of Appalachia". Few notes mention the military sealing the area off and shipping tonnes of concrete in. Claimed it was a radiation leak, but people didn't detect any radiation. It screams shady Enclave doings.
---
I trade all the time. Please explain how a timer would prevent that.
---
Pretty much, but don't like your chances of having kids after :(
---
Every since they announced multiplayer Fallout I knew this company was garbage. What a terrible idea, taking a game where every one of your descions effects the world around you and gutting it to fill the corpse with shitty loot box mechanics and multiplayer. 
---
Then, when people realized they spent $60 on the worst concept for a video game possible, they dropped the prices steadily every month and even gave the game away for free with consoles because people starting waking up. 
---
Now, when they hold the features you all wanted behind a $100 paywall, maybe you can see how fucking stupid this whole idea was.
---
If you act like a kid, I’ll call you a kid. That’s not an insult, unless you’re exceptionally thin-skinned. 
---
Do you need a SafeSpace?
---
You keep skipping over the fact that you tried to prove your ‘point’ by taking a comment out of context.  But that’s because you only hear what you want to hear, isn’t that right Michael?  Any anything else that didn’t support your presumption should just be discarded. 
---
Again, that’s adorable.
---
I will attest that frozen and invincible enemies exist in FO 1st as well.  
---
Playing as a guest on someone else’s server, ran across one last night.

I never did. I just transferred it. Just takes one small step out. Not game breaking by any means.
---
It just sounds too smart for it to have been on purpose by Beth.
---
Event starts Tuesday
---
The standard repair kits are obsolete due to the improved repair kits that you get from the SBQ.
---
You know how we all hate when people who’ve never played 76 come on here making incorrect assumptions about it? It’s no more interesting when you do it about other games.
---
Both people put up what they want to trade. Hit accept trade and it counts down.. like borderlands.
---
That is a far more accurate assessment that calling it a competitive game with P2W elements.
---
And the Pumpkin House daily too! Imagine if they rewarded 50 legendary scrip for Halloween or something like that, everyone would be playing them.
---
Shame Bethesda is so stingy with rewards. Well, with everything, but more legendaries would be healthier for the game as they would keep players engaged instead of leaving the game.
---
Thats all ya got? Come on....you can do better then that.
---
There are lots of games that charge for the game and then subscription on top. Don’t like it? Don’t buy it.
---
That does not exist currently.
---
I’ll predict right now that we see a full blown fallout (cookie cutter) MMO before we see a fallout 5.
---
Kent Connolly agrees with your comment:
---
&gt; She sounds...I dunno..real? Some of the line's she says feel like she's actually trying to tell us something.
---
He claimed me Shannon Rivers was the best.  As her successor I have to agree,
---
If you actually bought this you probably have more issues with your prostate than I right about now.
---
Ah. I see now. I never played borderlands. Thanks for explaining it for me.
---
Do you actually play this game bro 😂
---
To be fair, ESO does include those chapters with the subscription for free, just not the latest one. So when a new chapter comes out the previous one become free for subscribers. Still sucks if you want to play the newest content though.
---
Did your friend enter the code on the pad too ? 'cause you can only pass the lasers if you use the pad yourself.
---
Yeah, had one of these spawning on me whenever I'd fast travel. Not sure where it came from, but I suspect it may be related to requesting a government drop in the very far south at the edge of the map - the supply drop never happened (I am presuming it tried to drop it off the map but got held up?)

You cant really what a shit update LOL
---
Oh...breaks guidelines, or fans cant handle it?
---
Im keen to help you out dude
---
And that monetization feature is fine if that’s what you originally promised your player base. But please enjoy getting nickel and dimes for basic features. I’m certainly not stopping you. I’m just trying to explain why the backlash isn’t as ridiculous as you stated it was.
---
reddit user posts old news to criticize bethesda..
---
It’s amazing how much controversy this game has created. It may have been better for Bethesda’s reputation if it had gone the way of Anthem and immediately died. Now its just an continual controversy generator.
---
Yeah lol me.
---
Do y’all not understand exchange rates?
---
12.90 is like 18.50 in Aussie....plus I’m sure there is some tax because Bethesda is an American company.
---
Nope literally not P2W by Bethesda's definition and a long standing one at that.  You have wasted everyone's time since you have your own definition that is not how it is defined.   
---
Now you can not like 1st a lot of people don't that is fine but to put your opinion as fact when there is a definition and quotes that can be easily found stating otherwise, how about you hope of the hate train bandwagon and think for yourself and look up the quotes involving P2W.  Otherwise quit spreading lies and misinformation.
---
4 times the size of Fallout 4
---
You are what is wrong with the gaming community.
---
You’re right, I got the gist and it’s too long winded. It doesn’t change the fact that my response is correct. You’re blowing it out of proportion. It’s nothing more than convenient content.  Exploits aren’t pay to win either, they aren’t intended, are always going to be used until patched and not PTW.
---
lol you actually bought fallout 1st 🤣
---
After being a Fallout 76 hater since it dropped, I was probably gonna buy Fallout 76 for the Wastelanders update. The game’s price has gone down, lots of improvements have been made, I was poised to finally get it.
---
Then Fallout First happened .
---
Old news....I cant seem to find this previously posted here...heard it may have been deleted, and if so, why?
---
Finally someone said it! It is true, improvement to the world space, UI, and Creature and Weapon adding and improvements! it IS a big thing in this game!
---
You are the one that put in   
---
&gt; Let's get the TLDR summary out first: This is pay to win.   
---
Kinda makes you an ass right now.
---
This is a trash mindset, fuck fallout 1st but anyone who seriously condones and takes part in harassment like this is gonna be banned and rightfully so.
---
Reddit user tries to come up with stupid comment for fake internet points...
---
Most of those new players are alts my guy.
---
Move  along please.
---
How many shots does it take to kill a max level super mutant? I have several BE shottys but haven’t used them since the last nerf. I keep wondering why bethesda does stupid things like this while meat hook is still way OP.
---
You lost me when you said you cleared up 400 lbs of stash weight with 2 of every bulkable item and 30 of everything else. I had at least triple that and I cleared up about 120. 
---
Before even addressing anything else you've said, why start off with a blatant lie?
---
Nixing reasonable PvP is why I never bought it
---
If I can't roleplay Arkansas, why bother?
---
How is scraps and able to fix stuff pay to win? A convenience yes...pay to win, no, not in my opinion.
---
Now being able to buy weapons that do max damage, and even have effects that you cant get in game or something along those lines...that would be an example of pay to win.
---
You don't get paid at all 😂
---
Preach onnnnn reverend!
---
"P2W" is a loose term. It doesn't necessarily mean pay to *win* literally. Paying to skip having to do a ton of grinding also counts as P2W.
---
How else would Bethesda quantify displeasure other than a drop in active players following a controversial decision?
---
It is 40 hours thank you very much, you get two different endings and different slides depending on how you played it, but yeah people are done and getting pissed at the waste of cash.
---
It is though. It’s people crying because they expect EVERYTHING to be free if you buy a game. In reality servers and constant updates to a game are not free. And if I enjoy a game I have no problem supporting further development of said game. I would have paid the price for private servers. The other things are just a bonus in my eyes. Sure it could be a bit cheaper but it is what it is.
---
I’m a third-year University student majoring in Architecture and Historic Preservation, so collecting and preserving “ancient shit” is a pretty big part of my life. Otherwise I don’t get much time to play fallout or any other game for that matter since I’m working 35 hours a week overnight at FedEx Ground to pay for my own schooling and to support my family. Aside from all of that, your absolutely disgusting and baseless claims about Obsidian and New Vegas aren’t even worth addressing. Obsidian is made up of the original fathers of the Fallout franchise. They can take whatever inspiration from the Fallout world as they want to because it’s their goddamn creation. The game is completely its own world and the subtle fallout references only make it more enjoyable to any RPG player. Bethesda fanboys are going in wanting to hate it because of how much they loved Fallout 3 and 4, 2 of the worst fallout games of all time. And first off where do you get off saying Fallout 2 isn’t the best? I can almost guarantee that you’ve never touched it yourself and are just basing your opinion off of the fact that it’s an isometric RPG that isn’t first person like 3, 4, and 76 so it automatically sucks. Bethesda didn’t “save” Obsidian by “helping” them create New Vegas, they gave Obsidian a chance to create the Fallout 3 that they never got to make because they had to file for bankruptcy. But they have Obsidian only a year to create the entire game, intentionally trying to get them to mess up somehow, but in only a year they created what the majority of people consider to be the best fallout ever made with a huge immersive story that far outshines the awful stories of Fallout 3 and 4. Todd Howard can’t stand how much better New Vegas is than anything else he’s made, that’s why he never mentions it. I don’t know where you get off believing all of this bullshit but you need to educate yourself and stop playing Fallout 76. Please.
---
No thx
---
Make the ranger armor, actual armor..
---
Haha god i do love q race war
---
These maggots are supporting bethesda. FUCK that
---
If you want to split hairs - Adventure mode has no "win" condition, so there can never be a pay to win.
---
And I didn't say I didn't like it - I just don't think it's fair to the rest of the community.
---
Lets plan an assassination on every single member of the team that makes decisions, whos in?
---
Aye that's true on deeper level.
---
Lol people just downvote to downvote. I have you some ups
---
&gt; So you think that somehow removing the ability to get free atoms will somehow benefit me?
---
Well yes, as this would mean they would have to give things like the fridge out for free or lock it behind a paywall rather than leaving it ambiguous on if it’s meant to be free or not.
---
P2W!  People say it wasn't here already, but jesus they'll still say it doesn't give you an advantage.  Fucking shills.
---
 One of the things that ruined the game. This is where dupers came from.
---
yeah allthough we did see similar behavior in Payday 2 when the paid skins were released.
---
Stuff like people with skins getting instant kicked from the room.
---
It is though it can take you an hour in real life just walking corner to corner in fallout 76
---
You can keep leaving server and rejoing and farming the nukes zones. Your private server doesnt change every time.
---
I am probably older than you, and I make decent money so it is not a problem for me. My problem is that I don't want to invest money in a dying game.
---
I can only turn in 150 scrip a day and I've got max caps on 7 characters. I'm refusing to start another mule. So I'm kinda stuck
---
Can you Stimpak the Brahmin?  If not, then no.
---
I'm sorry, straight up my last comment was rude. I'm just getting frustrated. Time for a Reddit break.
---
I bought it and played for a little bit even though I hated the survival aspect. But I kept having to deal with invisible ghouls and immortal robots. So that bugginess along with the survival aspect made me stop. I tried again when the battle Royale was brought in but it still didn't feel right.
---
I refuse to believe they would reuse the assets of F4 in this game, let’s be real
---
This is dumb and doesn’t even justify a legitimate response....
---
I said that's a possibility if all the bullied players leave and player counts hit a point that the studio dont think its worth the cost to work on.
---
 Its also possible the studio just gives up on it. Why would people try to increase the odds of the game failing, by purposely lowering the player count. One is in the control of the  players. The other is not. 
---
Bullying others players can only be seen as destructive towards the future of the game.
---
I love the subscription. Worth every penny. Get a job.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Yeah I did not see it on the subreddit either. The sites are still up and active though. Did Bethesda ever respond to the kid?
---
But Pete Hines promised! 😫
---
I got The Outer Worlds.  Done with all things Fallout 76.  Bethesda can go fuck their hand.
---
“There’s always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it’s all free after launch – all our content, there’s no season pass and no paid DLCs.”  -Pete Hines
---
So if this is what you promised your consumers, you really think the backlash to a paid subscription that includes QoL additions is ridiculous? I’m not saying you have to agree or disagree with the service, but I wouldn’t call it ridiculous I’d say the criticism is well deserved. Normally yes I think if additions to a game aren’t free people shouldn’t have a problem paying. But if you’re going back on what you’re saying when advertising your game...
---
You're a beaut
---
&gt; $100 does not equal £100 . It’s £77.
---
+20% VAT = GBP 92.
---
What you are maybe also forgetting is that exchange rates are *uncertainty*.  USD 100 is GBP 77 *today*, but who the hell knows what it will be after 31/10/2019 (or whatever random date in the future Brexit happens).  When companies bill in foreign currencies they have to include not just the costs of converting today but the possible costs later on.
---
I love a suncunt burntree
---
I meant "at least 2 of each".  You like calling people liars, I like blocking assholes who are too quick to call people liars. Goodbye, good riddance.
---
didn’t read this because too long + I don’t care. fallout 76 is easily the most well made game in the series thus far. all the updates have been fun and people over exaggerate the hell out of all of the issues. it’s an always online game therefore there’s bound to be issues with it. go outside virgin.
---
Give it another try with Wastelanders when it comes out, still gonna be a while though. Enjoy Outerworlds and others in the mean time. Hell just come back to this sub and we'll let you know the right of it, if it's bad I'll be the first to say
---
True. Thanks for your insight!
---
Yeah, ya can barely even get a logical reply or response here, Reddit is great for info, but holy fucking shit is it a nightmare for any form of adult discussion.
---
Its more a pay for convenience. Who exactly do we compete against in fo76.
---
yep just some musing. been waiting for wastelander a few months, but now the joy has been drained completely, so will most likely not play it. don't think i'm the only one, but obviously it's a minority.
---
but this whole "it doesn't affect you" is such bullshit. imagine you want to go to the movies, but you're sort of poor and can't just pick any title carelessly. you also don't really have money to buy any snacks or candy for the viewing, so when you hear of this deal "no snacks or candy allowed!" you think "hey, i do think that sounds like an interesting movie, and i do hate when people chew loudly, especially since i know i won't be eating any snacks or candy myself". so you end up spending money on this - a choice in part dictated by your poor economy - to have as a nice experience as possible. then when you're there, not only are there people with snacks and candy, and some guy in a booth with a queue selling it at large (there is also a large group of people who is ready to defend the whole booth, but i digress) despite the very real fact that you solely bought that ticket because you thought there would be no snacks or candy.
---
it's easy to see people who are spending money and have no issue with spending some money, not just for snacks and candy, but for a variety of titles, will have no issues with this, even if the movie theater technically lied when they marketed it as "no candy or snacks during viewing". it's harder to see for those people who selectively spend money because they don't have a lot of it to spend, and are reeled in by false promises and lies, and in the end "the big corporation" get away with it scot-free, while you are poorer, your experience diminished, and everyone around you loudly chewing on candy and snacks.
---
could you ignore the sound of chewing and continue watching your movie, to salvage the experience? sure. but we're not talking about "could" but "would"; how many people would, for example, stay at a restaurant if they are ridiculed by the waiters? you \*could\* stay and enjoy your meal, but why the hell would you? in a similar vein, if they are lying to you while you make your order, you'll also not want to stay - even if you could.
---
now, i got a few hundred hours out of fallout 76, so as far as money spent per hour, i'm settled. the price was great, and to me the experience was very enjoyable. but bethesda lied, and people do not seem to care, and i don't want to be around for the next big thing they break their word on. so don't tell me "it doesn't affect you"; it's essentially killing any joy to be found in the game because as we all can see the game is heading toward mtx heaven, and always has been. this subscription and peoples reaction to it showed everyone at bethesda that the lights are green.
---
i really do believe that you will be of the same mind further down the road. you might not agree with the current state of things, but it's just a question of time if this mtx development continues in a similar fashion. and seeing as how willing people are to buy just about anything, bethesda calling this off is highly unlikely.
---
have you seen the game when you get it render in? People who haven't played the game confuse it for real life sometimes during the day time!  It is a beautiful game if you played past the B.E.T.A. Last year. :)
---
Edit: I actually went back to play fallout 4 to compare it, and Fallout 4 felt really grainy and well simple. Fallout 76 feels and looks amazing (most of the time)
---
it's really a game you need to grow on you  This game might be in a down area a t the moment, but This community has been able to bouce back from even the worst bullshit.
---
How? How is it not fair? Is it because people misunderstood the term content to relate to everything produced, (seriously they said content would be free and people got mad because they made the atom store)   
---
Everything they have said has been pretty carefully worded or quickly sometimes in the same sentence clarified upon or at least a quick revisit during an interview. We have known for over a year that private servers would cost money yet everyone is all mad about it.   
---
They went subscription based instead of one off rentals no problem there and basically you buy $13 in atoms and get free stuff.  That is the reason number one I have no problem I normally drop $15 a month on atoms and here I get to save a couple bucks plus get 50 more and an outfit and I do not have to worry about PK dickholes when I am leveling my alts up.   
---
Explain how it is literally not fair and how they broke a promise that was never made.  DLC content would be free (and has been)  and there is no P2W for PvP. That is all their quotes have come down to.
---
Get back to me when they charge for actual content in the game. As of right now they aren’t. There is a few minor perks. But they aren’t charging for waste landers and haven’t charged for any other update that added quests or events to the game. 👍
---
As of right now all I see is cry babying
---
I haven't touched 76 since OW came out. Probably will drop in for a few hours to check in the Halloween event, which will definitely suck like 99% of their new "content" and then head out.
---
I agree. I keep getting targeted non stop. I say,  we start making our camps in and around White Springs. Then place our Survival camps where we are actually going
---
Yeah I'm hoping the next fallout (if there is a next one) goes back to it's single player roots and THEN adds a multiplayer version.
---
Saved it in my opinion. Game would have been way worse. Hunting down legendaries for good trades was the only thing to do. Other than enjoy the survival aspect. I tried to stay away from dupped goods myself
---
If someone confuses this with real life, I don't think they have ever been outside.
---
If you think I'm wrong then explain why. Otherwise I don't see the point in responding at all. Your post contributed nothing.
---
Many large cities in the US have their own sales taxes.
---
For example, in New York City:
---
&gt; The City Sales Tax rate is 4.5%, NY State Sales and Use Tax is 4% and the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District surcharge of 0.375% for a total Sales and Use Tax of 8.875 percent.
---
IN GAME... all I see is collectrons, fridges and now scrapboxes... pretty obvious that a good majority don’t have a problem with this at all! 
---
Numerous posts in this subreddit is far from what the actual Fallout 76 community actually feels regardless of 50 posts complaining about Fallout 1st.
---
It’s literally not pay to win since paying you technically do not win anything nor does it make your character do better earn xp at a higher rate or anything that makes the character do better compared to any other player. 
---
I see it as the difference between the regular version of a game and the premium version... you simply get extra stuff. 
---
Fallout mirrored ESO on Fallout 1st as I mentioned 200+ days ago here in this very forum. Many thought I was crazy but to me it made a sound business decision and a large part of the community have ESO plus, so why not do the exact same thing in Fallout? 
---
People who say Bethesda “lied” must have huge issues with everything in their life outside of the game if someone lying is a game breaker... it’s a daily occurrence on multiple levels, sad but very true. 
---
So I don’t believe the 2019 mad at the world faux outrage... YouTubers get paid indirectly talking about Fallout thanks to people who watch them and rely on drama for views build that faux outrage more. 
---
Oh yeah... when you read these and they say “I don’t actually play the game but...” OR “I uninstalled the game...” sorry I don’t buy it... 
---
Ones that uninstalled never show them deleting their characters... go figure... 
---
Here’s what I said 200+ days ago...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b9tjh3/fallout_76_plus_much_like_the_eso_plus/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
Yeah I know right. Someone always tries to come in and troll! Depending on the subreddit some are better than others.
---
PvP is gonna be horrible when a player power leveled through all the hotspots, got all the legendaries they need, collected the limitless scrap for nuke mines in their private server, then jumps over to adventure to fuck your day up lol
---
And isn’t pay for convenience the same as pay to win? Winning is subjective in a game like this really
---
Of course it's not a good arguement because you don't win shit by buying fallout 1st. Plain and simple.
---
The major argument should be that they are not fixing the game properly. Game is so flawed yet they dare launching a premium asking for money, the nerve of these motherfuckers.
---
Didn't really mean to sour talk anything, just trying to express what I've seen from the community. 
---
And yeah, I'm not sure it's possible to win in a game like this, but for me, if I get to see my friends in 76 and if I get to make a decent amount of donuts then I'm content
---
My mistake, didn’t realize I was being trolled. Have a good day.
---
Could this be the vault tec experiment?
---
Wait are you saying you somehow magically put bulk into the scrap box? no bulk can go in it only raws.
---
Psst you should try messaging support. Because I think you can probably buy fallout 1st with atoms because you can buy eso plus with crowns vie a support ticket. In the case of eso plus is costs 1500 crowns so I reckon this will cost you 1650 atoms (also obviously you won’t get any atoms).
---
Coke would give them energy to look. Probably meth.

YOU: ".The classic trope of the downtrodden husband coming home from a horrible day at work and then beating his wife and kid. He can’t lash out at his boss, because he’s get fired and it wouldn’t have any affect on his boss. But he CAN take out his frustration and blame his wife and kid for something.,"
---
Weird that you would use this figurative language in an earlier reply to the OP and then go around calling someone who disagrees with you a kid.
---
Don't need to be a psychologist to see you got some issues there Dad.
---
I really wanted to get the responder shotty skins and also the freestate one, but because they got nerfed to next to useless there’s no point
---
I've played 20 hours and have just reached the second planet. There are 6 more. I don't think that'll be just 20 more hours, as I just found that mew areas on the first planet started unlocking as I did more quests.
---
And there are literally dozens of ways to do each quest. You really think people are not gonna replay it a few times?
---
Also, the dialog and stories are downright amazing, as opposed to Fallout 76's "go here, fetch that, kill some stuff, read a few notes" and then you get some Purified Water and a Bobby Pin as quest reward.
---
Isn't playing the game in general supporting the game as well?
---
And I don't even want to think of people being so petty of launching the game just to kill these people
---
Ah yes, here we go with name calling. You clearly have no further argument to make. Now that I’m showing you the evidence all you can do is throw names. Enjoy your denial, but all I was trying to do is show you how the backlash is more justified than you thought. You can’t accept that? Please enjoy the game and have a good life.
---
In reality, it was probably originally planned to launch with Wastelanders' original launch. Wastelanders was delayed but pressure from higher ups meant they couldn't do the same with 1st.
---
Not that I mind. Helps me make up my mind on this game sooner.
---
Fairly certain their bottom line is the only thing they're giving a shit about lately, with all the goodwill they've been burning.
---
I'm in the same boat as you I feel like this game has potential that's why all of this is sad because if it wasnt bogged down with so many bugs and rude business practices I feel like it could be a great experience
---
I received the world full message when joining friends a lot still so I’m not seeing an issue at all.
---
“Actual” content lol. Any content is actual content. At this point you seem to be reaching.
---
They'd probably just leave it behind the paywall. If they had just said that there WOULD be non cosmetic microtransactions I personally wouldn't have much of a problem. It's not even good anyways. 
---
I'm not even outraged by the fridge at all. It's Fallout 1st that I don't like.
---
While loose you have to see if the company has a definition as your idea of P2W does not matter. In this case Bethesda is very strict in that P2W is only tied to PvP. So it is not loose as you imply at least for this case.
---
P2W is when someone gains an advantage in a game by paying money. I don't care how big or small the advantage is, or whether you can get it for free or not. If it's a gameplay advantage that you pay for, it's P2W. Plenty of games have things that you can get for free, after tens or hundreds of hours of grinding, but you can get it instantly if you pay for it.
---
How short? If you think OW is *short* then in comparison, Fallout 76's quest lasts a minute.
---
I been toating my 3* mini gattling gun because they never land till dead for me eather.
---
Thanks that’s a good point, I saw captainnoob always used a shotgun to bring SBs to the ground then kill them with whatever other weapons he’s testing.
---
Yay!  You're a tax cheat, good for you.
---
Please remember not to use the public roads or call the police if you get robbed.
---
It's funny how that works, isn't it.
---
ok, if you beautify the game with filters and a good system you can get it to look good.
---
At least the Costume is Lore friendly
---
I’m not reaching at all. But keep crying.
---
Yes, i have. There are people with all manner of diferent tastes, some like to be abused, called names and to be beaten up, and all manner of diferent methods of phisical and mental abuse, most of these kinds of people suffer some mental disorder. Someone who play this broken, buggy (and now PTW) mess of a game for 120 hours and still defends the abuser is the kind of person who enjoys some manner of abuse, This is some stockholm syndrome level shit here.

Hey u/ladydevann, how do you feel about talking to people who think you should work for free?
---
Even the first two planets are not done in 20 hours. And the game has 7 or 8. They get bigger as you ho further, and new areas unlock on old planets. And it definitely is a full fledged open world RPG, not jist a looter shooter.
---
Anyone could IF they had the money... unless you have millions to throw away over years of paperwork and paying lawyers and I’m betting th a result would only be you losing all that money.
---
I highly...highly doubt this nightmare was a solo effort lol.
---
Allegedly 30.  But I'd assume a normal person could squeeze 50 to 60.
---
Same thing happened to me a week or two ago. I have the habit every time i see a work bench to "Scrap all Junk" to keep my weight down. It took me a couple days to realize most of those insect parts are scraped for their components when you do that. I ended up having to scrap items one by one until I completed that particular event.
---
Wow are you saying there’s a weapon that’s actually better performing WITHOUT vats?
---
I never called any names. I described your actions. Because that’s what you’re doing 😂
---
Now I don't discriminate. Regardless of there icon. I just grief everyone.
---
15eurocuntbucks  / month or 120 / year over here, which is even worse
---
Take my upvote you Scoundrel!
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
It costs half a grand in Poland.
---
The thing is, Bethesda had no way of making a profit from the game so their only choices were to abandon the game or create a new source of profit.
---
I can also make things up and pretend they are real.
---
I'm level 10. It started happening as I had found a aid request holotape, didn't even do the request part.
---
!remindme 4 months
---
I dont think they would care. They would move on to the next game they hate and continue the cycle. 
---
 Miserable people and bullies get off on that stuff and no amount of sane arguements will ever change things. 
---
Some people just lack the intelligence for simple problem solving.
---
"At least 76 plays like FO4" Yeah.... that kinda tends to happen when it's a reskin of the same game and all.
---
No VAT, you'd pay taxes based on your state/municipality. Some states don't enforce it on online transactions if there isn't a physical good delivered, some do. Some have state, county, municipality, and city taxes, or some other specific type of tax charged for online purchases. It can vary wildly and factoring tax differences the gap between pricing is a lot smaller
---
Well, when we said that repair kits was a slippery slope, no one listened, and here we are.
---
I don't agree.
---
Weight management has always been a thing in Bethesda games, it's not like they came up with that all of a sudden and make you pay for it.
---
At the same time, some less weight in stash don't really give any competitive advantage, so I don't care.
---
They should forget about this whole junk stash argument and fix the game right, as long as the game is well fixed I am good.
---
Not going to lie I haven't touched tOW yet but my wife played through and it took her 21.3 hours.  I am sure for the role playing aspect it will be awesome just from walking by while she played, I plan to play it on wednesday into the weekend so been trying to stay away from gameplay.   
---
Still I figured if she could beat it that quickly and it is two actual endings only that it would be around 40 hours, but I suppose if want to mix things up different ways it has more replay.
---
Neither did yours, like the OP, just trying to bend the term, it has never meant convenience included. Grinding junk is doable, everyone did it fine until 1st one way or another, many enjoy it. It makes it easier is all, you aren’t winning anything,  you aren’t gaining game changing exclusives for cash, better weapons for example. Grow up.
---
There more stuff to do, I’m level 198 and still have quests to do.
---
I haven't played in a couple months, mostly because I've been to busy to game. But after reading about the paid sub, I uninstalled 76.
---
I love the FO franchise, but I wont pay people to lie to me.
---
Is it Todd?
---
But it doesn't necessarily mean that, and by pumping money into this shit-show of a game you're only convincing the parent company to keep pushing for things that are more of the same shitty content.
---
No mercenary will stop dedicated workshop raider.
---
Why do people announce they’re leaving Fallout or uninstalling On a dedicated Fallout subreddit about Fallout? 
---
Will they and you leave them as well? Or stay for sympathy because y’all like drama? 
---
BEFORE you leave can you make a video of you deleting your characters? Yeah... literally no one does that... wonder why?
---
It's weird because they were really starting to fix things with Nuclear Winter, the bugfixes, and the hype for Wastelanders was there.
---
Then they throw it all away.
---
Yes, with a few shots the beast will land, given there is room for landing.
---
Oh, great points! It's only 80% more expensive.     
---
Currency rates fluctuate you know, lol!!
---
I have to pay state tax here in the USA.   I guess I misunderstood what was going on, my bad.     If I was to buy it, I'd pay like 10% tax on it, so $110 total.
---
They obviously can't be as "outraged as everyone else" because not everybody is outraged.
---
The problem is that the sales numbers are artificially inflated because human nature will obviously drive certain humans toward paying for time savers and other such gameplay enhancing features. Also, it's *very* obvious that we only have to pay for the luxury of some instanced cloud server instead of being able to host our own servers(Like, how servers have worked for... ever(?) in gaming. So what if the hardware requirements are hefty.) is that they can't control modding and will miss out on all that sweet sweet micro cash.
---
I'm not saying a company shouldn't listen to sales. When they're clearly just saying that to gaslight the public and cover their own asses while pulling greedy ass maneuvers like this though? Fuck'em.
---
You can fill the scrap stash with an obscene amount of junk during the one month you pay. And still draw from it after you cancel.
---
This bot says you need a girlfriend
---
I'm 99% sure she just rushed through the main quest. The game ends once you do that, like NV did. The most gameplay lies in the sidequests, as has been true in most Fallout games and similar RPGs like The Witcher.
---
And it definitely isn't "two actual endings". It is three broad endings like New Vegas, but with tonnes of different details depending on how you did quests. Again, you never see them unless you actually do the quests.
---
In comparison, in Fallout 76, you can run straight to the Enclave and launch a nuke by level 15 at most. Takes a few hours at best.
---
Oh gosh. As a player with over 1000 hours in 76, 32 years of gaming experience and a Fo1st membership...it's p2w. In 2 days I have farmed more of the most valuable materials than i normally would in a week. Yesterday i farmed 12 hours while watching football and the world series. Today i traded some of those those mats for a BE Handmade. Some players can't get a handmade and have been trying for months. I had multiple offers in about 5 minutes. Farming on private worlds is definitely a p2w feature.
---
The issue is people's definition of p2w. Some believe it only means selling better gear than can be obtained regularly in game. While others believe it means selling anything that provides an advantage over regular gameplay. Too much depends on opinion and we have all seen why arguing opinions doesn't get us very far
---
Fo76 doesn't even use the entirety of vest Virginia. It just combines the origional Virginia with the west to make a rectangular map.
---
Exactly my point: Bethesda double-downed by delaying Wastelander's and launching Fallout 1st. Let's assume Wastelander's October 2019 was gonna be a buggy/broken mess. What would 5 months of additional development time do for a company like Bethesda under a "make or break" scenario? 
---
They may fail but what happens if they knock it out of the park? Moral on this sub is so low that most will swear Bethesda never made a good game ever and are going to "fail at everything do b/c they've done nothing but fail with everything ever so Wastelander's will fail 100%...now come die in this gutter with me." Which begs the question: If Bethesda is THAT bad just wtf are those people doing here in the first place? Many won't share my optimism. But I certainly don't want to die in the gutter with those that have no hope among all things a game. 
---
I'll put my money on Bethesda. It's not like they're EA. If they go full-on EA, I'll be the first to boots to asses. But this is Bethesda. They make cool games, help terminally ill children through the Make-a-Wish foundation and come across more relatable than most AAA studios. Have you've ever heard Yves Guillemot @Ubi talk games? Dude's gotta be an android. But Todd Howard, you can sit down and have a beer &amp; good talk with that dude. 
---
To me, there's bigger fish to impeach. Bethesda's not quite there yet. EA for sure. In comparison to the vitriol on this sub, still much ado about nothing.
---
Honestly I loved it, and I'd rather support Obsidian for making a pretty damn solid game that, for me, goes back to the roots of a post-apoc style RPG.  It's a mix of New Vegas and KotOR with a dash of the Firefly Universe for taste and I absolutely love it.
---
It's from the Halloween event
---
Imagine doing a silo run, with no lag or latence during the core replacement section. I did it, on private server I invited myself to. 
---
Disturbing shit. Not fair at all.
---
Yes... if you r trying to mock me.
---
1850 Atoms per mile.
---
While im dissappointed in the route they're going im more surprised anyone payed 13$(or$100) when the game still has a lot of bugs/ freezes. But i also never bought atoms, the scavenger bot, or the fridge because the buffs as i understood them just werent worth the payment ( id rather visual).The scrap box does annoy me, but they probably wont remove it once the first sub was bought. Im just keeping an eye on it from the dark brotherhood side(playing skyrim).
---
I can't believe I see their new tag line being parroted. The so called QoL or quality of life items/update. Am I mistaken, or does that equate to the in store items that they reference, like the fridge and others that should be in game already or at least obtainable through ingame progress, rewards, etc..? If it's something other than my reference, I'd love to know what this QoL truly is. I was a player at release but couldn't deal with the bs being tossed in all directions by devs, so I'm on a indefinite hiatus. That said I drop in here and there to see if progress is made. And only QoL improvements I've seen are buyable IRL $ only. That's not QoL, that's LOL.
---
Yes?
---
What the stash box does is convert the junk items, which have previously been stored as individual items in stacks, into single line items with an attached value. This actually alleviates strain on the server, so it's a win/win. They get more revenue into a dying game, and there's less resources bogging down the server.
---
Yeah but expanding it include some more major cities and monuments of the area, like Fort Knox, West Point, D.C., Pittsburg, Ohio, etc. would be REALLY cool!
---
well you dont have to subscribe the full year ;-)
---
It’s the people complaining that literally stated they either never played Fallout (quite a few posts) or those that said they uninstalled but funny there’s no videos of them deleting their characters... many who joined the subreddit after it came out to post about it... 
---
They’re the ones trying to destroy it... but seeing collectrons, fridges and now scrapboxes in many players camps... I’m not seeing the masses have issues like at all...
---
No I'm staying on the subreddit for updates about stuff in the game, plus I like seeing the posts about cool things people build or come across. And I'm not gonna delete my characters because A) who deletes their characters when they're uninstalling a game and B) I said I'm returning to the game, I'm not throwing out my characters even though I'll be back in like 3 months.
---
Go ahead and reply to any other comments you can dig up, I'll respond to them all at once my guy
---
What a shocker.  A game with themes of class struggle and people struggle against a feature that only benefits players with disposable income.
---
I get that on xbox on adventure mode, but mine got much worse when I got the Super Duper perk. I think it has to do with that for me. I could be completely wrong, of course.
---
So there's no level cap? That's good to know. I was reading about someone saying "the level cap is too low" but I guess it was just a Bethesda boot licker then.
---
It’s winning by this game standards, but I agree. Can’t believe they did this, but it’s unsurprising when you think about it
---
Yea i can imagine everyone trying to kill that yugi  with the stupid syringer its a quest rose gives u 
---
I mean if u look at most amo containers you stand about a 72% chance to get syring amo like nobody use that weapon
---
We are talking about getting an advantage over other players by *paying*. That is the definition of "P2W". In this case, getting a tent that allows easy and quick access to your stash and scrapbox, and also getting unlimited storage space for junk items is obviously going to be an advantage. Why are we even arguing about this? If this is because you don't like the term "P2W" then just call it something else... it's just a word, who cares. It still means the same thing. You pay to get an advantage.
---
no im not tax cheat, im paying taxes in my country
---
its not my problem when regional prices higher and i go and buy from another place, free market
---
As someone your elder with the same ingame hours but more years gaming 37 years and a FO1st membership you are wrong. It is not P2W there is a definition of P2W you can not win this argument since P2W is a loose term, but the company has it defined. Therefore you must relate the phrase to the company's definition and not your personal opinion on what you think P2W is.
---
Mark my words: 3-6 months someone will find out they are a fool.
---
Either you, or me.
---
lol, i can give you that joke.
---
They aren't gonna run me off. I was followed and shot at. They just wasted their ammo. Didn't affect me.
---
Its hard out on these mean forest streets for a bear. Give us food.
---
Da fuck, it's not even 1:1? That's preposterous
---
They've been muzzled until we "Calm Down" enough for it to be safe to post. 
---
In other words, "Duck and Cover."
---
They know people are going to get pissed and they don't care at all. Fallout first subscription is meant for the few people who compulsively buy microtransactions.
---
If you want to do something, boycott the whole company, and that means Doom Eternal and TES VI
---
The game tried to be competitive with Survival Mode. Bethesda removed it just before they released Fallout Worst. What a coincidence... The thing is, what if Survival comes back few months from now?
---
You also say, "All PvP in this game is optional". Well, it isn't really. If you want to use ranged weapons, you have to be able to capture Public Workshops and defend them. With Fallout Worst, you can skip all that. So, Pay 2 Win in this case means Pay 2 avoid PvP or Pay 2 not get annihilated by dupers with god tier weapons. Btw, dupers exist because of fundamental game flaws. Not because they are bad people.
---
The "Win" condition is different in each game but the concept is the same. You are paying to progress faster than others. So it doesn't matter if the game is like the ones in my example. I just mentioned them because they lasted long, without braking these rules. I can't even remember the names of all the games that broke the rules. Will remember Fo76 though. It is the biggest scam I've ever seen.
---
Agreed. One of my buddies has a hoarding problem, and we spend a LOT of time waiting for him to throw away enough desk fans and typewriters to get underweight enough to fast travel. I don’t know why he picks them up in the first place, since his friends are mostly lvl 200+ and have enough screws to each fill up a dumpster. Sweetest guy ever, so I hope premium membership improves his quality of life.
---
I would look more towards Zenimax.
---
Alright bye
---
That’s not the point I was making?
---
Bethesda = government
---
Governments make the rules and seperate the mass into classes(parties).
---
Connect the dots
---
Human nature repeating itself
---
I've stayed entirely mum on this issue, but you drew me out as I was at your Scorched Earth event yesterday. So, thanks for that! (You folks certainly took her down quickly . . .).
---
Anyways, I can afford 1st, but play solo, so I haven't paid out for it yet. I don't mind everybody else having infinite junk stash, although admittedly I'm always overencumbered, so I'm sorely tempted to get it. But here's the thing: I don't like that it's a rental basically. I have enough subscriptions in life as it is.
---
I said those exact words 6 months ago when Repair Kits came out and there was a slew of hatred. I defended the game, and deep inside, I though "Bethesda won't do that, right?"
---
Well, who's laughing now?
---
How about using your unlimited scrap to craft unlimited nuke mines and killing players out of PvP? Winning in this game is also subjective, so when you’re using a private server to hoard all the legendaries, xp hotspots and manufacturing by yourself, you’re “winning”.
---
At the same time, you’re wasting $13 a month on trash, so you’re also losing tho
---
i thought that was the original goal
---
maybe (Soon) TM
---
i still just got started so i am a long ways to go before i see everything lol
---
but if they want people to keep paying for a subscription and atoms and stuff they really SHOULD add new areas to the game.
---
You’re right on the money I think.
---
What possible evidence do you have for this ridiculous claim?
---
I think most of the people hating on this are idiots but I see no reason to think they're hypocrites.  (Some of them are liars -- the people who claim they're quitting without being players).
---
(Context:  I have no interest in subscribing to FO1ST, I've never bought an atom, I have a fridge and a collectron, I've played since BETA).
---
The game seemed like it was improving for a more casual player like myself (lvl 49). It was still a grind at times for getting good weapons and maintaining them. I was holding out hope for them to do something like an update that would make scrap have 0 weight in the stash so less of my time was wasted there. This announcement made me uninstall... it was really disappointing that they took what should have been a QoL update to make the base game more enjoyable for everyone and locked it behind a subscription.
---
Speed running it maybe.
---
Wouldn't even be surprised.  The fanboys and shills will excuse anything Bethesda does.
---
The content is ass.
---
&gt; It baffles me how they thought releasing it like this was a good idea...
---
They probably discovered quite a while ago that there are enough dipshits with enough money who would pay for more of their shart scraps. I mean, it seems to have worked. People are paying, and the other sub is full of absolutely shameless, clueless suckers boisterously celebrating amidst their fleecing.
---
I think it's a lot of fun, but feels.... Bland I guess. There is another word that was honestly on the tip of my tongue, but I can't think of it.
---
The corporate shills shtick that is most NPCs wears off incredibly fast, making it almost depressing instead of funny. Not very impressed by the combat or weapons, it's very basic and so far the weapons seem to be your standard rpg fare. The quest payoffs are pretty nice and the environments look beautiful, but feel dead. Enemies are also pretty much the same. There's no difference between fighting one group of humans or another.
---
They only way someone can destroy, is if you initiate pvp by attacking someone. But no one can actually take stuff from your camp.
---
It’s amazing they thought they could do this, but not surprising considering their lack of self awareness so far
---
People give them money for no work... why should they make new content?
---
The amount of scrap boxes, fridges and collectrons out in most worlds negates most complaints about this issue. 
---
But people claiming they uninstalled it wouldn’t see that... they probably also didn’t delete their characters either... wonder why...
---
No worries, I exclusively play in private worlds now anyway.
---
For $9.99/month you too can explore west of westeros!
---
Im not sure....but I am expecting a lawsuit or cease and desist letter bare minimum. I am no lawyer, but I am almost positive he cant use their logos, images and bash them with ill intent like that...in a court of law, that is causing damages, and impersonating their company. Guy is probably gonna be fucked id assume, even though it seems all funny haha right now to most people.
---
&gt; They were gone for about 2 weeks after the repair kit debacle.
---
Yeah, that was a horror.  Some players have been overloaded for months because of all the free repair kits they had forced on them.
---
The amount of fools in the world isn't small as well.
---
You're being ridiculous. The sub is a good thing. The game obviously suffers from a lack of cash flow.
---
Every single one of you that rarely or never bought atoms, this is your fault by the way. If you made a point of only farming the free ones except for rare instances where there was a bundle that you "had" to have right then, then you're the reason this subscription has become necessary. The game was obviously struggling. We went from weekly bug fixes and changes, to bi weekly, to monthly, to a totally sporadic series of maybe fixes, maybe it was just a new package for the Atom Shop in the hope that some of you "loyal" fans would actually spend some damned money. 
---
You caused this, and those of us that are buying the subscription will be the reason that the game turns around, if it does. No, you guys don't deserve anything else for free. You were given the world, and you took it and ran away.
---
Again not P2W by Bethesda's standard and since this is a Bethesda game it is not P2W. There are many definitions of P2W but even if you go off the original then it is 100% PvP related and it was over gold ammo that gave a huge advantage over free 2 play players. And P2W in the original definition only related to F2P games.   
---
So again tell me why your opinionated definition trumps both the original meaning and the meaning that Bethesda has given us in the past even before FO76 had come out.   
---
At best if you wanted to identify it as something other than a subscription it would be P4C or pay for convenience.
---
Oh I'm aware, I was just trying to confirm this, because its unbelievable the mental gymnastics people go through to justify their actions.
---
That could be Ward and June Cleaver scorched. Sometimes they remember their old life for a while.
---
People can still break things they just become wanted
---
By your definition, for something to be P2W it needs to basically take you straight to the credits
---
It's also fine to criticize bad decisions and refuse to support companies that engage in them.
---
I think it’s just the crappy monetization model of AAA studios as a whole. There has to be a balance between charging in live services and keeping your game fun/playable while making sure your fan base isn’t FEELING jipped. I think Battlefront 2 was the best example. They had a terrible pay to win monetization, and people saw right through it. Once that stopped and they let Dice do what they wish with the game, it started doing tremendously better. I don’t think it’s too late for Bethesda, and I think the silence on their part is them thinking about how they want to change Fallout 1st to be less greedy-looking. I’d be shocked if they don’t cut back on some aspect of the service, whether it’s a permanent price cut or removing some features for the base game.
---
Careful, most everything has cost too much to ask for
---
My only grievance is people underestimating their power as consumers, as stated in each of my posts relating to the matter. I have no grievances with the game. I played at launch for a good 100+ hours. Came to my realisations and walked away. It's not just this one instance, it's with all games that have investors that want us to purchase microtransactions. The investors don't have any interest in the games, they're just laughing at us on their waddle to the bank. We can change this, but I can't see us all coming together to make it happen.
---
How is it winning, and what standards?
---
I saw your comment about Nuka mines but anyone would be better off shooting their guns or even just vats other people.
---
And they even have to farm the junk, lol.
---
No they can’t. That was changed probably like 4 months ago
---
Nope. I tried, couldn't damage anything unless the owner started shooting me.
---
Those are conveniences though, they aren't paying to be better than you, they're paying to not have to deal with something. I do understand where you are coming from though, I hope they release the scrap box for free at some point.
---
She may have rushed, I will find out for myself in a couple more days, when I have free time.
---
Only Bethesda has that power.
---
But I don't think stash or Fallout 1st as a problem, the fact that they are not fixing the game is the real problem.
---
&gt;&gt;  I didn't know Pete Hines
---
&gt;Please show me when I mentioned Pete Hines? Or are you going to try to argue that Fallout 76 devs *haven't* been doing a lousy job? 
---
You said the *devs* lied. What did the *devs* lie about? Because the *devs* haven't made any statements. 
---
&gt;&gt; Yes, that makes harassment okay! Let's excuse harassment because the company making the game did a bad!
---
&gt;Please show me where I said harassment was ok. You sure do like jumping to assumptions based on literally nothing but you imagination. Do you even read what you reply too?
---
"People will be angry, their anger will be misdirected at other players. And the circle goes on."
---
If you're not saying it's fine that it's happening, you're at least dismissing it.
---
If you're playing this game, definitely you lol
---
Why do they need to? You keep paying them anyway.
---
Wtf...
---
I’ve stood silent on the subreddit for a while now, but this comment-this is exactly how I feel.
---
Again, you're only focusing on the word "win" in P2W. It doesn't mean that literally. It's a loose term, as I was trying to explain. Yes, paying for convenience also counts as P2W. Paying to save a ton of grinding is P2W. "It makes it easier is all", you say. So, pay to make a part of the game easier then? I think this discussion about the meaning of words is silly. You know what it means. Grow up yourself.
---
Already is one. It's called Fallen Earth and had one of the devs (Tiggs) from SWG working on it. It is a dumpster fire.
---
As if anyone is going to be surprised that they're dead lol
---
Like I said... most uninstalling the game never delete their characters but I’ll give you credit saying you’ll be back. 
---
I get some people are mad... so what... it’s life however just like the news that shows the smaller minority of people mad to make it seem larger just like in this case. 
---
Almost every single camp I’ve gone to has collectrons, fridges and now scrap boxes... all 3 people posted and complained about... so a few angry posts does not reflect the community as a whole even remotely. 
---
Enjoy your time away and see you in the wasteland when you get back!
---
lel
---
Still, the logic supporting paid QoL items also can be used to support selling weapons, and that shows just how ridiculous this whole thing is. 
---
Hell, a couple years ago, even selling cosmetic items in a non-f2p game would have been considered absolutely insane. And now they sell gameplay affecting items in a pay to play game, and somehow we're ok with it?  
---
We need to face it, every little thing we accept when it comes to microtransactions is eventually used to make us accept more.
---
I hate this as much as you do
---
I hear ya, luckily im not "that guy" that is paying for it lol. I just stick around here at this point, cause its too entertaining and mindblowing not to.
---
This is far from the "first step" on that slippery slope. The first step was basic repair kits and the AS
---
You use too many big words.  Most of the idiots posting on r/FO76 these days won't be able to understand you.
---
If you kill someone in PvP you win. They farm the junk? In their private server where they have it all available to them and them only?
---
Why would anyone need to make a video to prove they quit playing a game? I, like most people who quit playing, did so because the magic was just... gone. It didn't feel like fallout at all after a while. I watched my friends drop it shortly after. Nobody quits playing a game to make a statement. They quit playing it because it's more trouble than it's worth or it's simply not fun. I don't need a video to prove that.
---
Awesome 👍🏻
---
Why did you make it?😂
---
Yes, I do use super Duper too.  I tried it without using the card a d it was still laggy. 
---
I know fallout had that fun feature when you had to much in your stash, it would litteraly take 10 seconds to take or store 1 peice of anything. 
---
It's weird though, I didn't really notice it until fallout 1st.
---
The shill damage control team got my boy just for spouting the truth.  Keep preaching, brother.
---
It's not a bad game. It's just not the "savior of player one" that people are exclaiming it to be. Combat is frankly boring, gunplay is pretty bad, despite a rather nice character creator most of it only shows up on stat sheets, the corporate shill shtick is so repetitive that it's annoying and almost depressing, and a ton of npcs look the same or so similar as to hardly see the difference. I have other minor issues with it, but I'll give the positives instead. Some of the quests are fantastic, the environments are beautiful if somewhat empty and small, and story payoffs can be great. Character interactions are beautiful, harkening back to Mass Effect one honestly. 
---
It's a good game, but not an incredible one.
---
Damn I took a break had no idea they changed it that’s good change though
---
I stopped the game from updating mid update last week on my Xbox and it uninstalled itself from my Xbox.
---
First time the game was ever convenient...
---
I'd like to point out that Bethesda Maryland has done a top tier job. The biggest mistakes are all non development related and as such fall to Bethesda Austin. Bethesda Austin was a shit show before Bethesda bought them, they still are
---
Excellent
---
I would be glad to help you (I am on PC) my IGN is JanynFletcher, I have helped over 200 now and I dont mind at all :)
---
Sell them? Donate to new players? Lol. Seems like just taking up space. But hey, you do you! No wrong way to eat a Reese’s.
---
No, that's fucking bullshit. You know what *actually* actively encourages and facilitates these shitty business practices? Capitalism. The system that prioritizes profits over literally everything else. 
---
How many things do you have that were made in China or India? I can almost guarantee you they were made by literal slaves. Would you be okay with someone harassing you for owning a smartphone? *Everyone* spends money on businesses that engage in shitty practices.
---
Idk, was a stupid thought that came to my head where people would be like wtf
---
Pretty sure the ones you get from killing the SBQ are better than the ones you pay for. It’s an online game, not a single player game. What SUCCESSFUL online game do you know that doesn’t have one of these a) a form of micro transaction b) a subscription or c) a pay to win aspect
---
Companies have to widen their revenue source to support large projects. Truthfully, there is no source of revenue for a completely free online game without one or two of these aspects
---
I strongly hope so but they will probably made illegal like the Protests in Hongkong. Just this time Bethesda is in the place of the red chinese communists and the Community tries to be Liberty Prime.
---
Democracy is non negotioable!
---
Yes, but he wants a single player fallout 76, and I think its safe for me to assume he doesn't mind paying a little bit to get that.
---
i'd help if i were on xbox.   
---
try to get the \*pharma farma\* perk card in the luck tree, and you can double search first aid boxes and such and find more stimpaks

My favorite part is trying to get the nuke authorization as a melee player. /S
---
It’s not 80% more expensive. Your maths aren’t very good. They are claiming 20% more expensive if converted to USD and that is due to local taxes and currency fluctuations. 10% is VAT, the other 10% is the current strength of the US dollar, which changes from day to day.
---
It’s a utility item in the atom shop, under the repair kits.
---
It’s not that you disagreed with me. It’s that you intentionally misrepresented a comment by taking it out of context and presented it as some form of proof of your point. 
---
I have no issues with differences of opinion. 
---
I have an issue with someone being disingenuous and deceptive when attempting to prove their point. 
---
That’s what you did, and that’s what makes you childish.
---
Same, I started playing again for Wastelanders, just for this to happen. Ditched this trash for Outer Worlds and modded Fallout 4 real quick, but it’s still funny to see the drama ☕️🐸
---
If you're buying things while pretending to not be in your country you *are* a tax cheat, assuming your country has any kind of sales tax.
---
What people want to do with their money is their deal and considering the amount out there of collectrons fridges and scrap boxes... it doesn’t exactly mirror the negative posts about them here. 
---
Fools? Everyone has an opinion, great thing about them is you don’t have to agree with them.
---
Are there more players wearing space suits?
---
I know, my dad was given stock as incentives at his old job. It's not worth much now.
---
So you just accept that FO76 is p2w and it *should* continue to have it?
---
Did they get royalties for KoToR 2? Maybe this history of getting stiffed on sequels is why they had to crowdfund their last two games. Right before getting absorbed by Microsoft
---
Liberator enraged.
---
It's not really about "losing hope".  It's about the fact that there are so many other games out there doing this type of game so much better (and for free or much lower cost).  
---
The biggest thing to me is: Think about how much of a player base would be left if this game didn't have the name "Fallout" attached to it.  That, to me, is the only thing that will keep this game alive for longer than another year.
---
Again, I hope I'm wrong and I hope we all eventually get the game we were all promised when we paid $60.
---
There is really no cause between paying them and them not fixing things you know.
---
Yes you can protest through not paying but they can still not fix it properly, bombarding them as recurring customer might even give you more grounds actually.
---
That seems very difficult, but if it works then it must be good? 😂👍
---
People will say it is due to crashing and all other things, I think it is just plain rudeness most times. I always check my map and wait until the player leaves before I log off. Now there have been occasions where a player will leave themselves at my camp for some reason for a long time and in that case, well they are on their own.....
---
Is having a high definition monitor and a high speed internet connection ‘pay to win’?
---
My thoughts exactly. It was saddening really, I hoped that even if they couldn’t redeem themselves they could at least redeem the game for the people who still play and enjoy it.
---
&gt; At least for B2C it's by law here in Germany.
---
Yeah, that's EU-wide.
---
These fucking comments lmao I am stunned at how easily people just lap shit up. God, at least go play Fallout 4 with mods if you want a sandbox experience. Literally ANYTHING than this.
---
Playing this game is like building toys with broken clothes hangars that a junkie sold you instead of Legos from the store. Jump ship already.
---
I always have some for sale, have some for sale right now and I never have problems getting 200 caps each for them, I try to keep it between 100 and 200 caps
---
OKay I will call bullshit on the $60 worth.  How many hours have you played? 100,200,300, 800?  I mean if you are newish maybe you have less but let's say 400 hours that would make the game have an entertainment value of $0.15 an hour. That is one hell of a return compared to say seeing 1 movie in the theater. I will go off prices near me.  $4.94 an hour.   
---
So unless you are new, I doubt you got a return worse than going to see the average movie.
---
I don't think Bethesda will like that
---
If there is somebody then he should have some good lawyers
---
Bad money = more bad content.
---
I know there is nothing wrong with buying the domain names, most companies buy various domains to prevent this. I think the term is called domain squatting? As for the logos I assume he can get taken to court for that but I am not sure. He can put whatever slanderous stuff he wants to on the website he just can "steal" their logos and stuff.
---
Bombarding them with money? When in the history of anything has that ever worked?
---
XD SoOOOoooOoo RaNdOm
---
How is this reply related to defending your statement of "Anybody still playing that ALSO hates on f1st players are filthy hypocrites though"?
---
&gt;Regardless of what people say, Bethesda DOES read them. If they didn't, we wouldn't have half of our content like vault raids, player vending, or even brewing
---
Do you have viable proof? Or are you correlating the two and reached the conclusion correlation is causation? Because all of those things are pretty standard to video games and are going to be naturally put in a game like FO76. Who is to say they didn't just plan on adding those things and the feedback reports just happen to ask for them? Wouldn't be too much of a stretch to believe Bethesda is claiming they are listening and pointing to coincidences where their development map intersects with player wishes.
---
Because **obviously** if they are listening they ain't listening very well.
---
In six months I hope you're going to be back here confessing what an idiot you were.
---
But I know you won't be.
---
I’m confused. How does being able to use ranged weapons have anything to do with taking Workshops?
---
Oh it's definitely a smart business move from a monetary standpoint.  They know they have whales who will pay, and it's good to have then reliably paying every month. 
---
It's just thrown what's left of their reputation in the toilet.
---
No but the bug you described didn’t make sense, especially if it happened repeatedly as you said. According to players with handson experience if two items are completely identical (duped), they will show as one item in your inventory and show the item count as 2. Otherwise they are listed as different items even if features are the same.
---
With complaints, clever boy.
---
Wow, I'm sorry you've had a bad experience. I've got around 400 hours and I've only ever had one slightly negative experience with players, which was just some incel stalking my character and staring at her, but other than that I've had no problems. I wonder if people in your region are just more inclined to be dicks to one another?
---
Where are we?
---
I appreciate you also being civil in the discussion. A lot of people just outright get super outraged. I actually didn't think of the Flux part of it. Also you can't assign stuff to your vendor from the scrap box.
---
&gt; someone who play this broken, buggy (and now PTW) mess of a game for 120 hours 
---
I played Fallout 76 just yesterday, and there really aren’t any noticeable bugs. Most of the glitches have been patched. And having more storage space isn’t really “pay-to-win”.
---
Same here, I love Outerworlds so far...only complaints I got is, a bit linear, and the gunplay is a bit floaty/shaky. Thats about it though, I do wonder do we all love it love it...or are we all just mentally drained from a terrible gaming year and love anything halfway decent that comes out lol. I honestly cant answer my own question there haha, sadly.
---
How much you want to bet, this was released to balance out the loss of Atom shop sales from all the people leaving the game?
---
Solidify their stance that they’re leaving the game and serious about not playing... sorry but I don’t believe them and I’m willing to bet the overwhelming majority don’t believe they won’t be back in the wasteland! 
---
Uninstalling is nothing... doesn’t mean anything to even say it... literally weighs 0.00 in any stash box!...lol
---
Delete their characters... let’s see if they’re serious about what they say... they won’t... they’ll be back, they always come back...
---
If you enjoy Fallout definitely give this game a go. At this point you can find it on the cheap side (I’ve seen $15 on Amazon for a used PS4 copy) and at this point you know what you’re getting yourself into in terms of Bethesda’s atom shop and subscription.
---
Immense back lash lol. You mean the clickbait YouTube videos and the minority of players that are part of reddit?
---
P2W is a common term for content in games that is locked behind a pay wall. Not things like cosmetic items, but anything that is going to give you an advantage over other players who are playing the same game and \*not\* paying. I'm done discussing this now. You know what it means and it's stupid to argue about a made-up word. It means getting an advantage over other players by paying, and that's it.
---
Really? Can you let me know your username? This would help a lot and save a lot of time too, thanks. 
---
Just started playing after the most controversy yet?  Smells like fish.
---
Oh I am riding this game out. I started on day one, back when it was announced, I'll be there till it dies prematurely. I'll even shed a tear thinking how great it was, till you whales ruined it.
---
IGN JanynFletcher, I will be on today :)
---
I agree.
---
"Apparently" ...lol, just because you assume they are new doesn't make it obvious or apparent, it's apparent you make bad assumptions. In reality it Doesn't mean a thing, I have 7 mules @ lvl 2. Low Level doesn't immediately mean "New Player", Everyone has 5 Characters Per account, highly doubt anyone is buying FO76 in droves like people claim....Fallout 1st is not drumming up new players, it's chopping away at the Base, this tree is going to fall over eventually.
---
That’s $2 is due to currency fluctuations. Get back to me in 6 months when the value of the USD swings again.
---
&gt; You said the devs lied. What did the devs lie about? Because the devs haven't made any statements. 
---
Todd is one of the games designers, directors, and producers. He is very much a dev and he very much lied. 
---
&gt; If you're not saying it's fine that it's happening, you're at least dismissing it.
---
I'm saying it will continue on because that's how it is. This is not a pattern that started today, and it wont be a pattern that will end tomorrow.
---
Lol. I never gave it a shot after its horrific launch. Been a "no" for me, permanently. I'm amazed with all the great games out there that anyone ever gave this a shot.
---
As an outsider, this is obvious. Game fucking sucks, it always has. They've never given a ahit about this game. It's a stop gap revenue stream between their big games. 
---
This game was never meant to be good, just make money. And y'all are praising it. It'd be hilarious if it weren't so goddamn pathetic.
---
You put any feedback reports in lately?
---
You defenders are always quick to get mad about a player lying, but have unlimited tolerance for the lies the greedy business that made this trash dish out
---
Nah. Even the Mayor of Grafton has been unusually quiet.
---
The count was low after they nerfed it so we all went back to adventure to PvP.
---
You tell me, whatever mental gymnastics you gotta do to justify playing the game, right?
---
They sold you a product that you're angry with and you're continuing to keep the community thriving. You're participating in giving a game that has let you down over and over again a heartbeat. You are supporting this game by playing it.
---
Remember the flag disaster, everyone all of a sudden was a homo supporter 😂
---
Amazing, I’ll be on soon and send you a request, My name is yevrahh. Thanks dude.
---
Anytime! I love the game! I heard about the hating about it before it came out and said well it's probably just people who don't like it cause it's not what they wanted. I've been a fan since Fallout 3 and love them all. So I wasn't about to let some people's opinions get in the way. I have been playing it on and off since Christmas last year and still loving it. The bugs and glitches can be annoying but that just comes with any game plus I just try to find ways to use them to my advantage lol. I voiced my opinion once back when the fridge and scrap bot were payable items (I just said people need to stop bitching cause it's not a pay to win thing) needless to say I'm pretty sure a lot of angry teenagers vented their frustration on me lol.
---
Yes, it’s Pay-to-Win. It’s pay to win because it is easier to create a “one-hit” build on private servers and that allows you to “steal” loot from players on adventure servers. Just look at all the crap bloodied builds get on this sub. Now I can farm legendaries to my hearts content with no competition.
---
Want to have a junk storage competition?
---
Mid update? Why you stopped the game on mid update? And how effects that to uninstall the game itself?
---
Yeah...id imagine if they pursue it, they will get him for using their stuff. Now if he monetizes that site, I think that becomes an issue, cause he will be profiting from their copyrighted name, logos, symbols etc etc.
---
How does it feel to be so obsessed with a franchise you waste countless hours on a fake game designed to milk fanboys?
---
I bought the game for $60, knew I got scammed about 30 minutes in, and played about 80 hours to get my money's worth and the game is done.
---
I come back after a year and there's no actual content added and you people are still playing it. I'm amazed, really.
---
A bad game you enjoy is one thing, this is barely a product.
---
Scrap boxes collectrons and fridges in the majority of camps I’ve been to... hmmm... kinda says a lot right there... 
---
Looks like the community as a whole isn’t exactly mad... instead I’m seeing more happy people that their experience now is better. 
---
A lot of faux outrage... trying to make it bigger than it is.
---
Smells like an opportunity to get people to attack me!
---
What are you winning?
---
There was an entire more set up for pvp that was barely ever used. While I understand that you enjoy pvp not everyone does and those of us that don't shouldn't have to be forced into it. There are measures in place I.e pacifist mode that are supposed to protect those that do not want a pvp experience however there are exploits around that and the exploiting is what I have a problem with. Personally I'm really bad at pvp so I just prefer not to do it.
---
Thanks,must check it out
---
It's just incompetence. 
---
Bethesda Austin made this. They used to be battlecry studios and made a game that was supposed to be a team fortress 2 killer but was so bad that their owner company Bethesda didnt even let them sell it. 
---
That's the first red flag. 
---
So they got rebranded to Bethesda Austin and were given 76 as a filler project between fallout 4 and 5. Just like how Obsidian was given new vegas to fill the gap between 3 and 4. 
---
The logic was probably something like "why hire a 3rd party studio to make the filler game when we can just use one of our smaller studios?"
---
The job was to make a Fallout MMO/Survival game. They appearantly did not have the expertise to make an online game and they didnt understand survival games either. Regardless of whether or not you or I like 76, if judged as either  an MMO or an online survival game, it's a design failure. It's missing key quality of life improvements and features that have been an industry standard for decades. 
---
This is their baby. Other beth studios had to swoop in to help them reach launch, and they've been trying to fix the game, keep players from leaving, and bring in more $$$. And sadly they've been failing at it slowly. 
---
The reason why microtransactions matter here is that they likely financed and budgeted 76 with them in mind. The funds to keep support on 76 going were likely to come from ingame transactions. That's not uncommon. 
---
The belief a few years back was that "live service" games would just be money printing machines that didnt require the massive expense upfront that real MMOs require.
---
The tragedy here is going to be when the cost/benefit calculation from Bethesda/zenimax tips over to "unprofitable". When that happens, regardless of player loyalty and love, they WILL pull the plug. That's just business
---
Forest, yes and yes
---
Maybe this is why they delayed the "Legendary player system". It is going to be a Fallout Worst exclusive.
---
Okay sure anytime, if you join the enclave part of being a member is a terminal that shows you where in the world the vertigo is and you can go and try to shoot them down. They are not tough to bring down if you have great weapons but finding them and getting to them to do that is time consuming. So while some will say it is no big deal, they are actually a hot commodity :) Both of my characters are bugged so I have never been able to launch so I just sell them when I get them
---
Under WV theres Kentucky  and  I would like to see some "People Republic of Kentucky "or something
---
Totally agreed. This should have happened when Wastelanders launched (and was proven to actually work and have been properly tested).  
---
The timing here is absolutely indicative of Bethesda trying to squeeze year-end money out of this game to try to meet budget projections.
---
Bethesda also doesn't have much coming out soon in the way of new games, so it's not surprising that they did this, but like you said, it should've been done AFTER the game had improved.  There are STILL bugs in the game from launch.
---
Its been around since release yet bethesda hasent lifted a finger.
---
Instead of throwing a bone just make a good game.
---
But you prob already knew that since you launched :)
---
Only the player making the last shot that kills her gets the challenge complete.
---
I feel the same way! I think a lot of the love comes from Obsidians good will and the inclination to root for the underdog that Bethesda screwed so bad. 
---
But yeah, I wish the game had 3rd person or at least the dialogue was like dragon age origins where we could see our character every now and then, but it’s still a great AA game. A thought I have is it’s laying a great foundation for a bomb ass sequel lol
---
So funny so many downvotes from outerworlds famboys or Beth haters or both
---
This literally reads like some dystopian shit that would be IN Fallout. "You are wrong, company word is law, I'm older than you so I know what's what".
---
Lmao you fucking loon, dude.
---
How is it P2W.  How do you fucking "win"?
---
If you were playing the game the day before FO1ST came out and you played the day after *nothing* changed.
---
Why should you care that some people spend money to play a *different* game.
---
Yeah, maybe you don't like the game, but then just admit that you don't like it instead of getting all bent of shape because some people want to spend their money to have a different experience than you.
---
FO76 is generally P2W.  The "P" stands for "play".  People who play get better stuff than people who don't.
---
I mean, I agree.  I'd give it a solid 7/10 but I'd MUCH rather support it and give Obsidian the change to make a sequel and improve then give another cent to Fallout 76.  At least Obisidan are giving people a good solid experience.  The corporate shill scthick is supposed to be repetitive and depressing, to be fair to it.  That's kind of the whole point of having the Corporation Controlled system.
---
After fallout1st a lost every hope in this game
---
Have you tried loading your original FO4 saves with that screen? Wonder where you could load into
---
If it costs 100 dollars in the US and 180 in Australia then that’s an 80% increase compared to the US. Or is there something I’m not getting?
---
Pay attention to your down votes mate and don’t kid yourself.
---
way late bud
---
That's very much subjective to the player. If they feel like they got their $60 worth, who are you to tell them their wrong.  Not everyone breaks down enjoyment the way you do.  If a player plays only 10 hours versus your 1000 hours, who's to say you got your $60 worth and they did not?
---
He didn't steal it, he got it 1st
---
No. Even if you solo her, it doesn't count.
---
Trademark and copyright laws will squash them if they want... it’s literally a non issue.
---
Bethesda openly goes back on the promise of cosmetic items, and you idiots are applauding it.
---
They can spend their money on whatever they want, doesn’t mean I can’t mock them for poor choices
---
You should figure out how to spell before you think about suing anybody lol
---
Registered it before Bethesda did.
---
I think somone at bethesda forgot to set a domain user.
---
The price though large is not the only issue.
---
Resource machines can only hold so much, and they do not give stuff quickly, you'd have to spend time and keep hopping around to just collect them, little by little. 
---
This might add to you normal farming but really you might be better off to spend that time used  to hop around to just keep farming normally.
---
And VATS or just normally shooting might be a quicker way than tossing a mine, seriously.
---
There you go again. The brain washing kicks in.
---
Much salt about being a moderator and having to waste time moderating something that even vultures wouldn't get near? Spare me the "the community must be kept organised and there are people that like the game and it is for them this "job" I do gladly" ...
---
I’d much prefer quests with actual substance personally.
---
They didn't steal it they brought it oversight on Bethesda's part
---
We have all been there and you have to remember this is a survival game! At those levels it is important to have strategy and you cant just going running in blazing, you will die. Keeping food and stims is going to be your biggest challenge for sure. Dont give up it will get better. Collect EVERYTHING you find and sell what you dont need for caps, you will want to buy stims when you cant find them...
---
Yeah for valuable stuff. For stuff that isn’t valuable you can just join a friend and leave it in a box and join on the other character and grab it.
---
It is with great reluctance that I must accept these emergency powers
---
exactly, at this point I don't give a shit about fallout 76, I give a shit about them learning these lessons and expanding them to starfield and elderscrolls 6.
---
I feel the only reason they haven’t stated anything yet is because they plan on changing stuff about the subscription and just want to see what works before they release any official statement.
---
How are you going to fail at bandwagoning lol
---
So you're saying just because you don't like what's going on I'm not allowed to support a game that I actually enjoy? I'm betting you would also get all pissy if someone tried to tell you what you can and can't do with a game that you actually enjoy too.
---
You are the man dude! Thank you!
---
Bethesda does not get to define terms and of course any business will go with the narrowest possible definition. I was trying to have a conversation with you but it looks like youre another that just wants to argue and be a jerk about it.
---
It's p2w, just not the most egregious definition of p2w
---
"It's not P2W, because Bethesda doesn't call it that."
---
"They aren't paid mods, they are mini-DLCs because Bethesda calls it that."
---
the grape juice?
---
Cost ratio is the only objective outlook you can take, if someone has spent 100 hours playing a game they had to have enjoyment or are a masochist (which is their own form of enjoyment so...)  Thus complaining about not getting $60 worth is sad when you look at other forms of entertainment.   
---
If you put 3 hours in and never touched the game again because you hated it then you did not get the worth.
---
Vault Tec is real
---
I’d say place a ticket in and see if you get the “this is a known issue...” response. At least we’d get confirmation of it being an issue. 
---
My comment was based on people who have said it so not sure if anyone has it actually checked off.
---
Don't forget to fill out one of those feedback reports on your way out. Those matter. It's like voting lol
---
Then you don’t have any competition against your production, so by default you’re winning, right?
---
Yeah. They came out and said "We like money."
---

In other words...
---
**LOOK AT ME!**
---
Ranged weapons use ammo =&gt; you need to capture a public workshop (preferably The Ammo Factory) =&gt; you have to defend it =&gt; PvP is not optional
---
Heroin most likely.
---
My bad I thought you were trying to be funny, so I tried to help and add to your joke. People really are taking it too far, and people who really give that much a shit have too much time on their hands. I just kinda stopped playing after a while. Haha but yes I key my full name, address, and social security number into every BMW I see. Except the bus ones. Those are still cool
---
When you have people who bought every other game of theirs and not this one yet seeing what the community says about it I feel like on the scale that Bethesda is at, they are losing more money then they'd gain with good faith.
---
Honestly not returning to 76 for a good while.
---
 But Outer Worlds wasnt as good as I was expecting an people are saying it is. The combat mechanics are mediocre even on hard/ super nova. You get stuck in companions ability cut screens for more then half the fights. The story was great I'll give them that but so many of the quest are exactly the same. Go here talk to X do Y for X to give you Z that you needed to give to W from the identical quest before. There isnt anything outstanding interesting guns. The science weapons are interesting but weak. I probably have another hour or less left of game play then I'm done. 
---
76 doesnt deserve anymore time from me at the moment. I appreciate the 600+ hours its given me but the Halloween event just isnt enough to make me wana log in. I'll definitely be back for Wastelanders I love what 76 can do but they just arent doing anything at the moment.
---
You mean NV. I saw the writing on the wall with 4 and it saddened me.
---
Awww did the troll wake up on the wrong side of the cave?
---
The “win” is preventing other players from getting loot and XP by one-shot enemies, or killing players and taking their junk and caps. It’s more pay-to-dominate
---
Exactly this, it's a buncha astroturfers my guy. Several don't even play the game and they'll admit it. Someone riled 'em up and said "go make a difference" lolol
---
I have been giving them away since the last update. Gave a few random low levels enough for scrip and 10k each as well.
---
That’s garbage, but hopefully enough smart people bought the Outer Worlds to make up for it
---
**Activate Liberty Prime!**
---
I switched to ESO 2 months ago and have not looked back. There is continuous content and near limitless things to keep me entertained. I have absolutely no problem subbing up ESO+ for the perks, as they are actually perks. (Sadly, I know it's all Bethesda)
---
My entire gaming life I’ve wanted to see a fallout game in Texas. The Alamo, the new republic of Texas, rangers, rad-nados. I hope they move us south-west. Texas is hardly mentioned in the series, so there’s a lot of lore they are free to work with.
---
Lol I have no clue who's 'internet historian' but the game wasn't and isn't falling. 
---
It's developing and growing.
---
Dang you're bad at analogies
---
Whales? Lol. So the players who purchased Fallout 1st are whales now? Do you spend money on your hobbies? I do, I consider Fallout 76 a hobby therefore that is how I justify spending money on this game.  This game isn’t perfect it never has been but what game is. I’ve been playing this game since beta and I still thoroughly enjoy and look forward to playing it every night. Remember it’s a game, everyone needs to remember that fact and not take this stuff so serious.
---
&gt; playing the game supports the game. Not anything else done by Bethesda. 
---
You're keeping the community thriving. You're giving the game numbers. You're being subjected to ads. You are using their product like it was intended to be used. Still, after they had lied to you time and time again.
---
By playing this game you are supporting Bethesda's bad decisions. Bethesda doesn't care if a **handful of players** on Reddit choose not to get Fallout 1st. They're still making plenty of money *without* Fallout 76 in the picture.
---
If you don't want to support Bethesda's lies and greed, stop playing the game. Let the game die until its good, because downing the Scorchbeast Queen with a bunch of 1st members without an unlimited stash isn't doing shit.
---
Pharma Farma perk 3 and search all the first aid boxes then craft antibiotics, removes disease and +50% disease resistance, I find this easier.
---
I really don't want to argue your point because I agree totally.
---
But some of us who have fridges and collectrons didn't pay a penny for them.
---
I am 100% in favor of people buying ATOMS and subscriptions if they want to, but that is not the way I play.  I am also 100% in favor of people playing like me, and, until proof otherwise I assume Bethesda are too.
---
I played FO:Shelter until I had a max sized vault of max level dwellers.  I never bought one single loot box.
---
(PS:  Kept writing FO::Shelter.  Too  much Perl programming).
---
Every cloud has a silver lining, I guess.
---
Bethesda is locking content behind a pay wall in a game that was launched broken and is still broken. Now they’ve stolen ideas from our community and are charging us for our ideas? They’ve basically admitted to lying about scrap weight limit which has been a constant complaint since beta and now NOW they have the balls to demand a subscription for the fixes to the shit we’ve been complaining about for the longest time now and some of you are confused!?!? Your active support for these practices is killing the game it won’t ever grow because of bs like this but instead of holding the company to a standard forcing it to grow YOU fanboys are killing it it!! Look at what’s happening to Ubisoft! You aren’t helping Bethesda your letting them dig their own grave! If they don’t stop this games servers will shut down in the next 5 years mark my words.
---
&gt;just uninstall the game 
---
Do it now and leave this sub
---
My problem with it personally isn't really the cost it is the fact private servers are attached to it and the whole unlimited junk storage. Separate those and drop the cost a bit and I'd be fine.
---
I was intrested in private servers but not a membership I'd rent a server. Also better if it was full capacity not just what it is now.
---
The unlimited junk storage that should just be for everyone base game.
---
And yes the price of the pass is a bit high. Half seems more fair.
---
Won't do what?  What did they do that is so wrong?
---
Well, there were some minor improvements. But the main thing that killed it was the 100 USD per year premium subscription for things that the community begged for. Private servers, unlimited junk storage.
---
They already got your money.  They know they won't be getting it again so they are not really worried about what the players think that would not pay for  the subscription service.   They are just milking this game to make a dollar.   If you quit  you are just costing them less money.   Use a script and keep your character in game even when you are afk.   If enough people utilize their resources all the time it costs them money.   Let's face it.  Few people still play fallout.  My friends list is huge and only ever has 3 or 4 people active at a time because most people quit.
---
You love to see it folks
---
Really not so good, every good stuff is inherited from Fallout 4, they are the combat and the building system (with some flaws).
---
Everything else like perks or equipment system are straight up mediocre.
---
Edit: Ok the questline and stories are fine by normal standards.
---
you should, maybe you could afford some self respect, and balls to stand up for yourself, how about even some forward thinking beyond your petty selfish life.  everyone that buys the subscription are going to be personally responssible if elderscrolls 6 is a shitshow of shitty MTX and missing features sold back to customers.
---
Open mindedness is the term.
---
In the end, if people enjoy a game they will subscribe to support the game. If they don’t enjoy the game, they move on. Happy vault hunting!
---
OKay here, the main stem from this whole 1st issue started with people screaming they lied, when they were proven wrong and they were not lied to it moved on to P2W which is a very loose term today. However if a company for it's business practice has a very direct view of what the consider P2W and gives it definition openly, then 1st does not fall into P2W   
---
It does not matter what you or I think P2W means for me I have always been more in line with the PvP advantage over the the original meaning which was you need to pay to win a free to play game.   
---
The issue lies in ethics and the fact that Bethesda did nothing wrong this time whereas many feel they did because of youtube ragers and trolls. It riled people up something fierce. "  
---
Now at the end will we agree, probably not as I see P2W as fluid if a company does not have a stance and solid if one does.
---
Correction: Private servers have only become a "paid" feature in modern games as companies have become more greedy. Nearly every old school game that is still beloved today gave the ability to host private servers to the players. The reason behind this? Companies don't WANT their games to have extremely long lifespans like quake or unreal tournament or tf2 because that'd mean they'd lose playerbase for newer games to that older game and they'd have to, in a way, still support that old game in order to keep the fans happy. All of these things are extremely anti-greed so no modern gaming company wants to support them. 
---
Taking away free private servers was just another way of supporting the "disposable" game society. 
---
Answer me this, name one game that has had paid private servers that was popular enough to command and keep a large private community. 
---
Now do the same thing with games that allowed you to host your own private servers.
---
I wish I had the ability to be this confident when I'm wrong :/

---
Well yeah you arent buying the games, you are leasing the licenses to play them like you do with Netflix etc. 
---
The way I see it is that I could continue spending hundreds of dollars on shit games that I resent myself for purchasing, or I could spend the price of one triple A game for a years worth of shitty (as in good but not worth owning forever) games I would have bought anyways.
---
Oh no I’m being down voted. The internet doesn’t like what I’m saying. Guess I should just go make a rage video in all caps so the internet will like me again
---
Or how much Bethesda will pay to get these domain names back.
---
They could add an expedition option, kind of like in Far Cry New Dawn, but a larger area. Quest could start with having to repair a Vertibird. Fuel would decide how far we could go, a destination could vary between 1500 - 5000 fuel, the most costly expedition would be the ones with the highest level and best loot.
---
thats not our fault, they are the ones that made a shitty game that couldn't make them money, maybe wait till the games worth 60$'s like the wastelanders update would have helped with.
---
Still making stupid assumptions.  Loads of us who are cool with atom store repair kits, fo1st subscriptions and so on are cool because we *don't* need or want those things.
---
How do you target someone if they are in a private server?
---
Oh so you literally have no facts after you looked it up so you came to spread your opinion and leave got it.   
---
Here top definition and the oldest from 2011:  Short for [**pay to win**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay%20to%20win), in the sense that in order to 'win' a free to play game, such as [**Maplestory**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Maplestory), you need to pay for various advantages to 'win' [**ingame**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ingame).
---
You make an excellent point here about reputation. Can reputation not be rebuilt? Especially if you have a storied history like Bethesda and wanting a 2nd chance? Everyone good deserves a 2nd chance, right? ;) Like I said in my post, "It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission." and Bethesda seems to be doing just that.
---
Add to this, that the gaming industry is so fickle and so, "What have you done for me lately?" no matter how much past success you've had. Ever curious why we're so quick to dump a company that brought us Elder Scrolls, Fallout 3/4, Rage, Wolfenstein, et al? If you're only as good as your last game then why not put it ALL on the line including your reputation? If Fallout 6, Elder Scrolls 6 or Starfield hits then you easily go from gutter to glory. If you're Bethesda, you take that chance every time.
---
Most survival games of this genre allow you to play offline (ie single player) or host a private server directly (though that seems to have limitations to keep the game from crashing, such as a limit on how far apart players can be). Paying a sub for what comes naturally to a lot of survival games is insane to me.
---
Ah, a martyr. Downvoted because they don’t like what you said and they have no counter to your statement.
---
Not to be a conspiracy theorist, but I think this may be a test balloon to see if this game is going to get any future updates. If they can't meet the subscriber goal, you may never see Wastelanders. This seems very carefully orchestrated.
---
Piss off
---
I thought it was pretty good and accurate. But see that’s the difference here in our perspectives is I think
---
Hey, dumbass, when was the last time you bought any atoms?  For the majority of players the answer to that question is going to be NEVER.  
---
All you ever see in this sub in regards to the atom shop is that everything's too expensive so no one buys anything, or there's nothing good so no one buys anything, or everything good is in bundles that people refuse to buy.  
---
Also, dumbass, Bethesda doesn't make any money off of atom shop purchases when people are sitting on hoards of free atoms.  If they don't get people to buy the ACTUAL bundles of atoms in the first place, whether through offers like this or the atom bundles that come with a free outfit, they don't make shit.  
---
I personally have well over 15000 atoms saved up from not even trying and will likely never have to pay bethesda another cent unless something I like pops up in one of these bundles.
---
I dont have to when you suck lol
---
Fallout 1st was slated to release with wastelanders most likely
---
No.
---
You would be correct, if these were private servers. However they are not, they are private "worlds" there's a big difference between the two hence why they named it accordingly.
---
the real reason for the subscription, is so they can find out how much shitty stuff they can put into elderscrolls 6 and starfield and idiots will buy.
---
How is it winning when I can farm faster than the workshops produce.
---
I wont open my wallet anymore. Already paid 300$ for this game an its Power Armor edition an like 50$ in Atom shop. But when they do add things like that an content updates I'll come play. But theres no more progression for me at the moment. My gears "maxed" my CAMPS are built an I've done every quest/ daily / events 100x over.
---
man, it saved my life, i use a 144hz ultrawide monitor on a rtx 2080, and it really saved me from playing at 20fps, thanks man :D
---
The only way they know who u are is by wearing the outfit otherwise how else do they know ur a 1st member
---
People are so dumb today it’s beyond belief. A few would bash something they never played just to clickbait. Idiots got baited and watched it and spread the BS also without playing it. I actually run into people in real life that says FO76 is horrible then when I asked them they told me they never played it but their favorite youtuber said so. Unbefuckinglievable.
---
You are 100% wrong but that's ok.  I assume because you use so many meaningless words in your responses to people you have lost track of the conversation.
---
Just read through your earlier responses to the OP and you will see where you slipped up.
---
Overdosing
---
Thanks for the reply. I agree that this sub (and reddit in general) can be a bit dramatic. I don't really care about private servers or any of the ATX stuff because I opened my wallet twice for main and mule accounts and that's enough money for one game. I'm not upset over Bethesda's hype man saying everything would be free because I've worked with plenty of marketing/PR people and know it's their job to full of utter shit. If they were to, say, add legendaries to the ATX I'd bounce for good but nothing so far affects me much.
---
I do, however, think frustrations over content being influenced by business decisions are valid. Someone else pointed out that Zenimax was somewhat recently added to the portfolio of a private equity firm and, in my professional experience, PE firms are pretty savage when it comes to influencing how a company is run and it usually impacts consumers/employees/clients poorly. As a consumer, I personally hate feeling like business decisions are being shoved down my throat (looking at you, Microsoft). The atomic shop standees at train stations is a good example of something I found pretty irritating but not rage inducing. Thankfully this awesome community came out with a mod to hide them on PC prior to their removal... 
---
I'm sure Todd would be great at a BBQ. It still feels like there's a ton of passion and creativity in the game which is what I look for in Bethesda games. I'm a total pessimist and have accepted that this game may never live up to it's potention but admire your optimism and do sincerely hope you're right in the end.
---
You're not special enough for a real death threat, When someone says "You should die", they mean it figuratively not literally.
---
But this is hilarious. This guy stays
---
Or they could just put you on ignore.
---
Lets say harassing players with subscriptions is effective (*which it isn't*), you'd be stuck playing with a bunch of toxic like-minded apes that nobody wants to play with. That wouldn't be helping the game get any better.
---
I'll take a community over 1st members over a bunch of grieving brats who claim to be boycotting *without actually boycotting* any day.
---
I support Fallout 1st. It now allows me to have a true Fallout Game. Playing Solo
---
&gt; It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrents—except at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.
---
--  Bulwer-Lytton
---
one more reason to get fallout 1st. I'd like to be given the goose by a posse of vindictive players.
---
I have to add as a side note, the whole thing about workshops is that they don't impact the game so much, that people would fight for them, not even the munitions factory. People fight just for fighting's sake.
---
FINE? BY *NORMAL* STANDARDS? What are your *normal* standards? Even Fortnite BR mode has more story than this game.
---
Go play Outer Worlds and see for yourself what story and quests mean.
---
i've read its 180 AUD aswell, aswell as 100 british punds.
---
Developing into a tumor.
---
Like not a big game?
---
Can you show me which parts of 76 Todd developed? You realize producers and developers are different, right? The *developers* have literally spoken in public like maybe twice. 
---
&gt;I'm saying it will continue on because that's how it is. This is not a pattern that started today, and it wont be a pattern that will end tomorrow.
---
So you *are* dismissing it. That's a shitty fucking attitude. "Oh well people will steal things anyway, might as well not do anything about it."
---
What a shameless shill
---
&gt;get cool dance emotes, have access to unlimited workshop materials
---
Quick, say aluminum for me!
---
I dunno. It did cost me $60. Last I checked that was a AAA price.
---
*Pittsburgh 
---
Shame you got that wrong.
---
Here's a quote from pete. I don't consider it to be lying, i feel more like they tried and failed.
---
That third and second to last sentance paint a different picture than adding a subscription service that includes new features
---
We'll see how it goes with Wastelanders
---
Win what?
---
So would you call an AAA game a normal game?
---
It should be funny. Instead I see and it kills my drive to keep playing because I'm not enjoying it. If you make a dark and depressing game that isn't enjoyable because you keep tossing real world issues at people with no hope, no prayer of change, then you, the player, become trapped in this depressing atmosphere.
---
Explain how it’s a ‘poor choice’. Just the Atoms alone make it a value.
---
Yes, I also know how to google. I quoted urban dictionary in a previous post I made 2 hours ago.
---
Here's another one from urban dictionary:
---
[Link](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=p2w)
---
As you can see, it's a loose term that can mean different things depending on the context. But it always means getting an advantage over other players, like I have been saying the whole time.
---
Are we done now?
---
It’s disappointing.
---
Don't forget to hand out your stuff before you do. Maybe one of those people coming out of that vault could use a good start
---
Lol you cant even take the lightest of criticism, so what would be the point in conversation anyway?
---
The sub is not forced. The freeloaders are just whineing thinking everything should be free.. they need a nap or passie.
---
Owen doesn't have any friends!
---
&gt; If I don't get the fallout 1st subscription (which I didn't plan to anyway) will the gameplay remain the same as it was pre-FO1st?
---
"I'm benefitting from fallout 1st, are you?" Nah, a lot of better ways to spend 100$ or whatever the amount is in dollarydoos.
---
Yes. Have you ever played a game before? It's AAA or Indie. Bethesda definitely isn't indie. If you sell an Early Access game, you typically release it for much less, at most at $30 if the game is huge in scope, such as Factorio, although most Earlt Access games stay below $10.
---
Yep my ts gamma is really handy
---
I've spent 1000 hours in game and I still have fun without FO1st. I've run 2 characters up to level 100 now (I think you get 5). It's super fun meeting new people and completing events in a group.
---
The game
---
I’ve never needed to use the Ammo Factory to gain ammo. 
---
Lead from mines, gyms, nuke silos. 
---
Steel from practically everywhere. 
---
Gunpowder is in abundance virtually everywhere. 
---
With Super Duper 3 &amp; Ammosmith 2, I’ve not only never run out of ammo for any of my ranged weapons but been selling surplus like mad. 
---
You do not need to take or control any workshop to get any resources. There are almost always faster/easier methods.
---
They earned a salary or were paid for contract work... end of story. This is not the music industry.
---
That's a really good point.
---
No big difference, depends on your style. I prefer to put points into strength, because six bullets usually mean having to use a baseball bat to finish some fights.
---
&gt; rediculous
---
Ridiculous.
---
(fuck, tried to write without help, fucking spellchecker told me I'd fucked up.  My brain is clearly fucked.  Please ignore this post).
---
Says the guy making a post about suing because he didnt get enough free stuff lol how dumb are you?
---
Have my upvote for the truth
---
&gt;I am probably older than you,
---
Bet you a hundred caps you're not :)
---
&gt;My problem is that I don't want to invest money in a dying game.
---
No one is twisting your arm to pay for a private server and the game is hardly dying.  Nearly 18K people on this forum alone seem to love it.
---
Exactly.  I see Bethesda trying, scrambling to make things better, but it's like putting a temporary band-aid on when you have a cancer within that takes every effort and tries to eek out every possible dime they can from it at the players expense.  We can't stand for it.  Bethesda, at this point, will tell you to your face that all they care about is the gamers, but apparently the decision making powers are clearly granted to the next person who has some absurd scheme to screw the players over for money.
---
Bethesda has exhausted any goodwill that their player base had for them.  At this point, they can't do much that isn't going to be heavily scrutinized, because now we are well aware that they're trying to bend us over at every turn.
---
I'm not your mate, buddy.. yes the pizza thing was mine and you didn't grasp it. It's completely relevant as it's I'm using it as an example. The subscription 100000% effects gameplay, COME ON. Stability is better on a private server. I just explained I saw that. You can't just say shit and expect someone to believe you..so I looked at videos and read posts. You can too! Stability is better. You cannot play the game fully. I can't beat a raid on expert because of LAG which is gone on private. I am butthurt that people are voting in favor of all of us getting fucked in the future. No one is arguing this isn't a money grab. We get that. You have to get it by this point or you're just fuckin with me.
---
I know they aren't forced at all, but the audacity to lock very requested behind a massive pay wall after saying that they weren't going to have P2W features (that being the Junk Box) is a rather scummy thing to do.
---
AAA games are not normal by any means, that's why we have high standards for them.
---
If anything indie games are the norm because there are less big developers/distributers than indie developers that you might not even heard of.
---
Maybe you played too many games that you need better schooling.
---
The H is important.
---
We know.
---
XD a fallout 76 fanboy is the last person that should be taking shots at smart people’s self worth
---
Come on...ya can do better. Assuming you are 12 or so as of now.
---
Agreed. I’m like 7 hours in and haven’t finished Emerald Vale yet. I’m sure that future playthroughs will be much quicker, but this is going to be at least 35-40 hours for someone like me that picks through everything. 
---
It’s not as long as FNV, which personally, I think is a good thing. They’re going for replay value, so it needs to hit a sweet spot for length that is long enough that a first play feels deep and immersive, but replays don’t feel tedious and repetitive. I have a feeling they’ve got it right.
---
I’m happy it helped you
---
Lets see. Fasnacht had a broke Prize RNG. Burrows had zero replay value. Imposter event required alot of caps to replay and the community turned on each other fast plus it was only handing out fedoras. Arktos was straight broken on launch. Tourist was delayed yet atom challenges were mostly tourist based. Vault 94 is a tedious fetch quest. Theyve not allowed a respec. No increase to gear cap a year later. Junkies was broken for what 6 months? before it worked and is the only alternative to a bloody build. Lets not forget those nerfs.
---
The timing is hilarious. BL3 has been out about a month, and you already had population drop from that, and then you have this announcement 2 days before Outer Worlds drops!
---
It's like they are daring us to abandon the game. And I did.
---
&gt; Can you show me which parts of 76 Todd developed? 
---
I'll give you 2 replies to this.
---
1st, he was a game director of F4. F76 reuses a ton of F4 assets and mechanics. It's piratically the same game, but with MP mixed in. It's so much the same game, that bugs from F4 appeared in F76. 
---
2nd, Todd is an executive in Bethesda, and was the lead producer of F76. Todd very much had a say in how F76 was developed. He may not be the one doing the coding, but he does have a seat in a position which can influence the direction a game takes. 
---
&gt; So you are dismissing it. That's a shitty fucking attitude. "Oh well people will steal things anyway, might as well not do anything about it."
---
What's a better attitude? Pretending it can all just go away if I wish to my fairy god mother? 
---
Getting shot at in a PvP video game for having paid cosmetics is not high up on my "list of things I give a fuck about". Especially not when said targeted players can leave at any time and play on their own just fine. This is a non issue and I will not pretend to virtue signal for something so insignificant.
---
Is that Bethesda’s logic? Cause they’ve always said they’re supposed to be contested and in the early days they were a lot
---
Yes a few people have said that, but thank you still! That sucks that both characters are bugged, as it is a big part of the game of course. Cheers mate.
---
So by your definition Fallout 76 *is* a AAA game. So, what's your point? That's what I said. It charged a AAA price and then delivered content less than most indie games.
---
hm, what?
---
&gt;It's developing and growing.
---
2.8 user score on metacritic. Are you sure it's growing or are you just guessing? Because I would not believe such a statement unless someone showed me some actual statistics and player numbers from a credible source.
---
Cool, cheers.
---
Yeah I was gonna use it for a month for the costume and atoms.....but $18 ??? 
---
No thanks.
---
And I'm assuming you're discarded genetic material somehow made sentient by the level of intelligence you displayed by making this post. ;)
---
Right? I guess I’m not allowed to play the game that I enjoy and helps with my depression and stress.
---
You go ask anyone if they actually fight for the workshops not just for fights lol
---
Al - U - Min - I - Um
---
The story behind the different pronunciations is actually quite interesting but not something I have time for here.  But frankly, in this case there's a good argument that the US pronunciation is probably correct (although not grammatically so).
---
They are **LOOK AT ME** posts and represent a minute voice on Reddit that is itself a small part of the user base.
---
You’ve answered with an insult, not what you are actually “winning”.
---
For me it will be much longer, I think. I finished Emerald Vale at around 9 hours and then later, found that new areas unlock on Terra 2 as the quests progress. Plus, the second world onwards are HUGE.
---
I think I took a look and theres just too many to bother with on mobile.
---
I want my private murmrgh that does more than sitting there selling me stalker’s pipes🤬
---
Not that I've seen.
---
I haven't seen any of the new 500 atom guts on display either.
---
I mean, if you don't enjoy it you don't enjoy it.  There are plenty of quests that make the places you visit a better place.  I mean, the WHOLE point of the game is to take down the corrupt Corporations government and give Halcyon back over to the people and you do just that.  You are the hero in this story unless you directly choose not to be.
---
I don't know what to tell you.  I mean, if you didn't like it you didn't like it, but I think you're focusing way to hard on that negative atmosphere and ignoring the fact that the game expects you to want to change it, not give in to it.
---
That's why I said normal standards, not high standards, not aaa standards, not Fallout standards, clever boy.
---
Yes because you can assume all that from me calling him out on his lying. Ok buddy
---
Weight limits make sense in a survival game though.  Keep in mind that when this all started, we had a 400 WT Stash limit, which was pretty ridiculous, but goes to show what Bethesda's thinking was at the time.  They wanted us to pick-and-choose.  I still believe that even if they could implement a bigger Stash, weight limits are a sacred cow to them, albeit a misguided one, imo.
---
Also imo, the Scrapbox should be offered to everyone.  Because the thing is, while you familiarize yourself with what junk you need to repair things, you can never keep a running tally in your head of just how much you need of it.  What needs 12 Steel?  What needs 4?  What armor takes Screws?  What armor takes Ballistic Fiber?  If you can just hoard it all, these problems are moot.  Take it all, sort it out later.
---
I have never been more proud. Today is a good day.
---
Pay to win is defined as anything that reduces grinding or other time consuming aspects of the game for real money.
---
Bethesda has already broken the "everything will be free and you'll only pay for cosmetics so I doubt theyll make anything that would make the game worthwhile free
---
I'm guessing you're the "smart people" in this situation lol
---
No, they didn't. It's still an awful game.
---
Hell yeah
---
So you don't buy games with the unreal engine as well or is it just the usual 'epic bad' circlejerk?
---
Umm welcome to the internet, friend.
---
Umm there are no god weapons in the atoms store or loot boxes offering god tier wepons eather. The only Loot box mechanic in the game is the pervayer. So not pay 2 win. You want Pay 2 Win go play Elder Scrolls Blades then you will see the diffrence.
---
Yeah, for sure they will. But they deserve to pay for whatever Bethesda shoves down their mouth for the rest of this games short life. Let the 100 people pay and pay until Bethesda says “whoops still not profitable” and shuts down the servers. Then we can laugh when they’re all mad about all the money they spent
---
Nah! Dismissing something as false because you disagree with it is what people don’t like.
---
Providence Equity Partners owns probably half of zeni at this point.  They want a decent return on the hundreds of millions of dollars they've spent.  Though, I'm certain zeni wants a big profit as well of course.  But with what likely amounts to 'controlling interest' in the company (or at least a very large influence on operations), I'd be pointing the finger in that direction. 
---
BGS, and to a smaller extent zeni, have an interest in preserving the franchise.  PEP has no such interest and just wants to pump and dump.
---
OK, fair enough, I'm wrong.
---
You need disease cures to craft antibiotics.
---
Not really a nerf. It's a bug, the game can't register damage properly. All those pellets drive it crazy and your damage goes up and down, as if the enemy was regenerating health. This happens with regular shotguns too. My instigating shotgun causes less damage than my instigating walking cane, even with no melee perks AND nine shotgun perks on.
---
Yeah one of the bots on the trade subreddits checks your reddit info to keep out scammers. It has stuff like how old the account is, how many completed trades they have, and how many comments they've made on Reddit and I'm at almost 50k comments so it would take awhile to get anything juicy lol
---
L
---
The game is not dying. It is already dead. And how did you come to the conclusion that 18k people love it? Please explain!
---
Id say the state of the game is how you want it to be. Draw your own conclusion, not based off of online sources as its all a hot spot for he said she said arguments
---
As some have said, nothing in 76 is forced upon you.
---
Personally, i still enjoy it. And probably still will into the new years
---
I mean they're releasing DLCs. The content is growing. It's developing with adjustments.
---
 And over time I, yes, guess the amount of active and paying players is growing. Of course there was a high after release and probably atm there are some leaving. But I'm sure at all there are more than enough players.
---
Depends on where (in the world) the website is located. And the domain name itself isn't trademark infringement because as far as I know you can't trademark domain names.
---
Where on earth did you pull that response from? 
---
Who even mentioned you not being allowed to play something that helps with your depression????
---
Yeah, streamers using Day 1 Beta bug videos and labeling them as new is totally honest.
---
Gfto sheep
---
The com,Mets are full of Bethesda defenders. It’s sad how many people don’t have a limit, and will keep being brainwashed by a company that screwed them kfer.
---
Sounds like the trump administration
---
The end is nigh.
---
The price is really the big issue for me. I actually like the idea other than that.
---
You are dead right about the tent. Never deal with being encumbered again. And yes, it's very handy in a fight as well.
---
Not sure why people are going nuts over the scrapbox when the tent is so much worse.
---
Not if they did it on gamepass. Looks like Obsidian's getting gypped again. They don't make as much as if people bought the full game at retail
---
!remindme 5 months
---
Haha, no harm done. No honestly, I haven't come across this when playing in the EU time slots. I do end up in the US if I play really late at night, otherwise I never get any trouble from other players. Not even the russians, who tend to be double D douchebags in most other games! (Hi ruski!)
---
Makes sense, I agree.
---
I don't disagree that if you've played a good number of hours playing, you've probably enjoyed it to some level. I think FO76 is on a different level though.  With all the issues the game has had, the bad times then updates, then the good times, more updates and now the bad times and given all the negativity on here, it's reasonable to assume that the level of enjoyment people get can't really be put into a dollar amount.
---
I could have put 300 hours into it because I kept hoping it would get better.  Reading the news and hearing the updates planned, it's reasonable to consider people play the game hoping it's going to improve.
---
I purchased FO:4 the day it came out, played it last night even.  But I have less than 100 hours worth of game time, does that mean I haven't gotten my $XX.99 worth?
---
that's so cute, if only you noticed the hate is directed toward the ones who blatantly use false information.
---
there are a handful who used launch day bugs in the most recent videos of "how bad and buggy it is"  or lets not forget the ones that included PA edition helmets in the mold issue, even though the info was in the thread they word for word quoted.  they are just reacting for the clicks yo, fuck proper info.  they deserve the hate they receive
---
then there are the ones who try, talk about our current issues, use recent footage to show the things.  that actually put in the effort to get information correct.  we don't hate on these youtubers.
---
Other sub?
---
Duh, I’m not the one shilling for a greedy company that has no passion or commitment to making a quality piece of work and only sees the players as pay pigs
---
Truth be told if they made the price $12.99 for a year then it’ll be a steal.
---
&gt; normal standards, not high standards, not aaa standards, not Fallout standards
---
Dafaq? You mean, it's ok by bad standards, then? Because you are excluding everything except bad games. Fallout 76 is a AAA priced game and I should expect the game to have worse content? Are you mentally sound, buddy?
---
Fair enough. I would however guess that with such a terrible score and reputation the game is losing players rather than gaining them.
---
Yep.
---
The only thing that really altered my gameplay was the Scrapbox, mainly because now there's just no reason not to hoard everything I come across instead of having to pick-and-choose.  I believe the Scrapbox should be available to everyone simply because it makes for a better game.
---
Nah, nothing yet.
---
I have a small part of me hoping that there will be a proper response to this Utter greed on Bethesdas part, But the rational part of me realizes that is pretty unlikely.
---
Which sucks because this made me go from "I play Fo76, the game isnt as bad as others say. Maybe give it a try" to "Bethesda pulled a Dipshit move. Avoid the game unless they rectify it." Still cant believe wasterlanders was delayed just for this to get dropped on us.
---
People are free to bully the smoothbrains that support shit like this.
---
This should have been $5/month or $50/year. 
---
I don't mind what's included but when you factor in what they have said about the popularity of the Atomic Shop, I think they should have settled on a more reasonable subscription price. Yes, people can earn Atoms but the payout is low, the shop items are overpriced, and the incentive to purchase atoms is high. So, it's safe to assume many are straight up buying atoms.
---
I paid the $13 for the month but only for the month. I am not gonna renew anytime soon unless we get more bonuses or they lower the price. Preferably they should do both.
---
slippery slope fallacy strikes again
---
theres a big difference between convenience and buying a bloodied explosive gatling laser
---
Aw you didnt punch a hole through your tv and quit the internet like everyone was hoping for?
---
Given the amount of people calling for a boycott of this game and calling you a shill if you don’t agree... but I don’t let the opinions of people who are unhappy stop me from playing a game so it was more sarcasm than anything. :) I’ve been playing since release and I’ll keep playing. If me being happy playing the game makes me a shill, I’ll take the title.
---
I’m honestly not sure how the game pass decision will work, but Microsoft acquired Obsidian, which is why it’s being used to sell game pass more. Hopefully it pans out and Obsidian builds a cult following for a AAA funded sequel. If Rage can get a sequel, anything is possibel
---
I disagree. 
---
I’ve seen a hell of alot of passionate displeasure. 
---
I wouldn’t say that it is being made bigger than what it is if it eventually made its way to BBC news. Lets hope it gets better for everyone.
---
Did I ever say you should expect that? I am giving objective assessments. You should calm down boy.
---
Maybe they'll even add OPs mom to the atom shop.
---
Lmao at all the people who just suck off bethesda. "Bethesdas definition of P2W is just pvp so this is fine". Why does it matter what their definition is? It gives a clear advantage to the player, and they have to pay for it. Just because it doesn't give them boosted damage doesn't mean that they don't have a big advantage.
---
Stop letting Bethesda get away with this. If everyone didn't put up with this bullshit, most of the stuff in fallout 1st would be free. Stop allowing them to scam you. It's a 60$ game, why should you have to pay a subscription on top of it? Not to mention the cosmetic only promise. You people realize you're the consumer right? You don't owe any loyalty to bethesda, they work for YOU, not the other way around.
---
True, BGS didn't register it, or thousands of other domains that could contain the word fallout.
---
Trademark issues will probably become something that that person will learn a lot about in the coming weeks/months though.  Especially since he's asking for donations.
---
I'm guessing you know less about game development and working contracts than I do if you think that's how it works.
---
That sounds like paying for a convenience, not anything you win? What do you “win” in this game?
---
At this point I'm pretty sure it's not the game but your hardware starting to fail. Memory corruption maybe?
---
I don't know how well they will actually finish this quarter. But it makes perfect sense to roll this out Q4. That's when finance is forecasting for the next fiscal year. They can "foresee" massive profit and sell this as a reason for more investment from the board. 
---
They are very likely trying to do this to avoid a cap raise. Cap raise is bad for the people at the top actually working for the company and good for the board. 
---
I'm honestly concerned that I'm not sure at this point if Todd having more control or the board is better. 
---
If people would actually abstain from the subscription it will royally fuck their forecasted numbers and a change in leadership becomes more likely.
---
&gt; Whales?
---
15$ definitely makes you a whale xd
---
See I always thought he was still talking along the lines about F2P and P2W mechanics and that he wanted to avoid them. That could be since I understood content to be DLC level products. The fact that since Oct 10th  2018 that he said private servers would be a paid service with modding coming later on to them.   
---
So I have always sat on the features part of his statement as a private server would be a feature, but was said it would be paid. So what is a feature to him or was he just talking in general compared to P2W style games.   
---
So we fall back to dates,  Aug 27 Hines said the private will be paid only, on October 10th Pc gamer published saying as much. While your quote was from later in October after beta had released. So what is a feature to them if they had already decided to make private servers paid?   
---
That is the only weird phrasing that left me wondering.
---
Of course it's pay to win. Why else would people pay for the sub if it didn't help. They clearly weren't making enough through cosmetics. Enjoy the winning but I'm long done with the game.
---
Oh no? How is it NOT a convenience if I go to a "convenience" store and pick out the exact legendary I want? It is pure convenience. Nothing pay to win there. It just saves me having to server hop for 200 hours.
---
Oh! But I thought Fallout 1st made the game pay to win? Why aren't the 1st players able to win against non 1st members automatically? Is it because everyone was whining for nothing? Oh, man!
---
Little kids attacking grown men with jobs who can afford to pay 12 dollars? That's kind of funny.
---
Doesn't matter, whatever they do is evil af so get in line and hate.
---
You’re so cool. 👍
---
Nah. I would indeed quit playing if levels or weapons/armor came to the atomic shop.
---
People can think and have an opinion but I’m literally seeing it the opposite in the wasteland... seems like the overwhelming majority have all three... the fridge/collectron posts were crazy!...lol
---
I just said that the Junk Box is the mechanic that is P2W. Plus all of the borderline useless things that are included PLUS the fact that private worlds, a feature that was MAJORLY requested and hoped for, is locked behind this EA sized pay wall. It's evident that Bethesda is currently just wanting to squeeze more money out of 76 players. While I used to love the game, this pay wall kinda killed it for me. I am hoping that Bethesda will either decrease the cost substantially, or make the features free and lock the junk box behind a questline or something. While I don't hate 76 at all, I do dislike it as of now.
---
look at review dates, look at the reviews themselves, most are all the old circlejerks. there is also the fact MC is stupidly easy to review bomb (which happened with 76)
---
I’d like to think that they’ll work on something to calm the pitch fork bearers at least as everything was going oh so smoothly, even with the delay of Wastelanders and how we would all rather it be 110% perfect.
---
&gt;  I'll even shed a tear thinking how great it was, till you whales ruined it.
---
Nothing has changed in the game since FO1ST was introduced.  Nothing.  The only thing that changed when repair kits were introduced was that some players were inconvenienced by the weight of all the repair kits they were given for free.  Some people complained that the collectron (buyable with in-game atom points) gave too much rare scrap so Bethesda "nerfed" it.  Those of us who have one didn't give a shit because the dad jokes are still as bad. 
---
Oh, I'm such a whale that I've never given Bethesda a single penny since the initial purchase of the game.
---
You whiners are such a bunch of egotists that you can't imagine someone having a different opinion than you do.  I play FO76, the game I bought.  I buy things in the Atom shop using the Atoms I, or anyone else, can earn in-game, I repair things (rarely) using the advanced repair kits I can earn in-game.  I've visited the camps of people who have scrapboxes, they're cute but I feel no need to have one of my own.
---
This is not a competitive game.  Why are you so obsessed with what other people do and fictional futures?
---
TL;DR:  Chill.
---
That’s not funny. There are many players who have never set foot on Reddit, and have no idea that people are angry, no idea that other people dislike this, or it could be just someone who genuinely gets enough enjoyment out of the game every day that they have no problem paying to support it. 
---
Would you want to be harnessed? 
---
If you don’t want to support this, that is your right, but it’s not your right to question someone else’s decisions and harass them over it.
---
Fuck. Dont have xbox. Guess ill have to add this one to my to be pirated list.
---
I don't think slapping to initiate a duel is a good way to do PvP. I also don't enjoy workshop fighting. I think  you're right that Hunter/hunted, Nuclear Winter, and Monster Mash are the best forms of pvp now
---
Sure, but I’m talking about Bethesda’s intention. They’re selling players a way out of conflict.
---
But back to your point, the players are fighting to fight. So who’s gonna win? The 2nd class level 42 trying to enjoy the game or the level 150 1st player with all their hoarded items and gear?
---
Got tired of server hopping, just to find every single gym empty. So no gyms. Mines and silos require killing mobs, and how is that going to happen if you don't have ammo? The best way to farm ammo is always going to be the Ammo Factory and it is always contested.
---
no im not because i can travel just the same in usa and buy the game without vpn  for less price
---
its not my problem that betehsda didnt lock price at your account settings, but only at your IP adress
---
you can get gamepass on PC too
---
It's their attention to detail in fucking up that really puts them over the top.
---
At least i got the event awards from scorched earth.
---
That’s great to hear. I’m having so much fun with it.
---
Yep, I was actually going to put survival but I'll wait until wastelanders comes out.
---
Nobody is calling you anything. 
---
Stop creating outrage about yourself.
---
I like lasters better. those elitist firsters think they saved the game and we should be throwing them a parade. They call us entitled! Pffft.

Oops!  Sorry - Forgot I was on the whiney sub - my bad.  Thought for a moment I was on /r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ where 18K poeple (and growing!) actually like the game.
---
Again - my bad
---
Because their videos are outright lieing about bugs for clicks.  They are engaged in just as greedy and assholeish behavior if not more so that they accuse Bethesda of partaking in.
---
For example, I cant remember the last time I encountered the T-Pose bug, but there it is front and center in these assholes video.  I play ~2 hours a night.
---
So... Forbes and the BBC were reporting about the tubers then?
---
Please take off your blinders.
---
Screw off.
---
Many people take personal offense if you criticise something that they like. They feel personally attacked, even when the criticism wasn't directed towards them. It's pretty strange when you think about it, but I guess it's related to tribalism and the way human beings function in large groups. "Us and them" thinking is built into our brains.
---
EDIT: And ofcourse I'm instantly downvoted.
---
That’s great except no one will pay $100 for an extra quest, mobile stash, and which is all fallout 1st would include if Bethesda did that.
---
Most companies do if they want to remain a company.
---
You can just find antibiotics in first aid kits, instead of making them.... I have like, 80, and never made them. Just Pharma Farma.
---
No because it is your opinion. No matter what at the end of the day Bethesda defined for FO76 that P2W is related to PvP before the game had even released. We knew from day one P2W in their eyes only applied to PvP and not anything else.  From a business ethics standpoint they have done nothing wrong and because it is such a loose term it is taken many different ways but when a company lays it out on what they view as P2W then for that one game or for the company's catalog than that is what P2W is and can not objectively be taken any differently.   
---
You say it is an advantage it is, however not a PvP one and since we knew private servers would be a paid service that is also a non-issue.
---
How about comparing a level 42 and another level 42 with the sub? You should have paid attention to your science teacher.
---
Still, I believe I already answered that question, junk don't give you an edge in fights with all else equal, you'd be better off straight up shooting or using VATS than keep tossing mines and shit.
---
@ the entrance of silo ......
---
When did I say I don’t buy games with the unreal engine? 
---
I just don’t like the idea of closed garden PC stores like Epic is trying to create with Epic Game Store exclusives. That’s the reason I refused to buy Metro until it comes on Steam and why I bought Outer Worlds on Microsoft store.
---
If Epic suffers from poor sales despite buying exclusivity then it will send a message.
---
No problem!
---
Good joke 👍
---
 You are a big help. ;) Go to Slocum Joes, grab all the Firecap Mushrooms across the river, the one in the yard and the several behind and to the South of the place. Go down to the river and grab Bloodleaf and Snaptail as you make your way to Flatwoods. Go in the Vault-Tec Agricultural Research, go downstairs to the back and grab the Firecaps in that room and in the corner at the Chem Bench make some Disease Cure. ;)
---
Dont give them ideas... They will take the ideas and hide them behind a paywall
---
Google the definition of a shill and get back to me chief.
---
!remindme 6 months
---
I just canceled the auto renew through my Microsoft account. Not sure if there is an equivalent for the PS.
---
All you did is show them that there is a demand. So they will continue to supply. You effectively justified the non-gamers in the company of their decision. You just made bethesda a business, not a passion.
---
Gameplay will remain exactly the same. All fallout 1st provides is some convenience features like the tent that you can plop down pretty much anywhere and private servers where you can play by yourself or with other people.
---
Thanks! Great answer
---
You might be right, possibly they figured there was a core audience who would be on-board with paying for an atoms and private world package, and that would outweigh the cost that came from histrionic gamer reactions. 
---
Definitely feels like a short plan rather than a long term one, and hasn't helped the game's image issue. It's a shame as well, because at the heart of it all, it's a pretty good game.
---
The "Fallout firstest, most premium pack- for 30£ a month you get a brozooka and no clip. Brozooka is 1 hit kill on anything but other firstest members" /s
---
Dumb? Not at all. People have sued for less for one. Secondly, twas simply a question of if you could. There was no reason to get butthurt or name-call. But you're coming out of the gate swinging aintcha? But as other posters commented (civilly mind you) there's no real point and it would take millions and years to do so for probably a losing battle. 
---
As for to why people would want to sue, we were promised a good gaming experience and what we got was metal gear survive fallout version. There was false advertisement and lots of people feel betrayed. I'm sure I'm not the only one who thought of it, I just wanted to know the legal standing behind it. 
---
I have my answer. And I'm moving on with my life. You should too. ✌️👋
---
again
---
It's the same. Slightly more stable now. And theres a subscription service to get gameplay helper items and a private server.
---
Finally someone makes the real argument. I've been waiting for days for someone else to say this; freeing up stash for extra combat perk or two.
---
Grafton Mayor quit to protest ;)
---
I believe hes going for the crafting chems daily's.
---
That’s what everyone’s been doing for the past year lol
---
I brought up the fridge and collectron only due to the outrage expressed over them, not how people got them whether earning atoms or buying them, fact is a small minority of players complained... 
---
I say small only due to seeing fridges and collectrons literally all over! 
---
I’m seeing the same exact deal with scrap boxes. I’m thinking it’s the minority of players. 
---
I bought the subscription mainly due to wanting a world to explore with friends and do the events without someone one shotting the legendary...lol
---
Scrap wise isn’t really a big issue anymore... I’m good with my stash so I placed it in camp since it looked like a snapon tool box and looks cool. 
---
I also have all my scrap bulked so I’m not gonna unbulk it to but it in, maybe new stuff in the future but I have a lot of bulk. 
---
I’m also not arguing... it’s just an opinion and Believe it or not I’m also one that can talk to others that have different opinions and be respectful....lol

Its actually ridiculously cheap for what you're getting.

Again, I wish I could be this sure of myself with an arguement that completely falls flat. Assuming my level of intelligence because I have a different opinion about a video game company's monetization practices - automatically qualifies me as the more intelligent of us two. Not only are you wrong about Bethesda, because its Zenimax, but you're dumb too.

I wouldn’t be surprised

I ain't seen 'em.

Scrap box...
---
I ain't fo1st, and they land fine for me.... when I let em.
---
Was excited... now deleted.
---
I should back charge a monthly fee for the time it spent dormant on my HD.
---
Bethesda slacked on buying the domain and an angry fanboy snatched it up first.
---
Bethesda fumbled this whole thing from day 1.  And for someone who watched the legal fight play out for years leading up to this... all I can think is “They spent how much in court to get the right to release this piece of trash?”
---
It sucks because 76 is really great in terms of Fallout lore.  But anyone who thinks this is a good video game is not facing objective facts.  The game is poorly designed as an online game in almost every respect.
---
The closest they came to “turning it around” was the initial launch of Nuclear Winter.  And that wasn’t really that close.  The game is finished after wastelanders.  And honestly I doubt we’ll see another fallout until we’re at the tail end of the next gen of consoles.
---
Right. So why isn't it filled with positive review bombing then? It's not just the haters circlejerking. Those who have been defending this game have been equally guilty of that.
---
You hate it so much yet you can't get over it, fo76 is living rent free in your head
---
15-100$ dollars on a 60-200 dollar game definitely makes you a whale, and if this game is a hobby then you really have no life lmao
---
Lol. You STILL can’t answer the question. You just respond with insults
---
You’re right! But most larger places it’s not or can be controlled by ICANN
---
Kinda funny my comment got downvoted...haha, sorry to those so sensitive to trademark laws... grow up... read and learn...
---
Lol boys have dog brains, I swear. Keep up the nerdy defense of capitalism and greedy corporations!
---
....
---
Right. The game was on sale 2 weeks after launch. Which was messed up as it was almost half off.
---
One man's wet sack of shit is another man's peaceful private server.
---
“I don't need the tent and scrapbox to sweeten the deal”
---
I couldn’t agree more. I payed for the subscription because I love having the option of classic fallout solitude on a private server. I really wish they’d move the tent and scrap box to the base game.
---
Hey yeh you got a point me broda
---
Your personal experience doesn't reflect everyone's, just because something seems a certain way....doesn't mean it is that particular way. No, most people on my friends list are currently playing The Outer Worlds, only 10 or so are playing FO76, the rest are playing fortnite or COD.
---
Because I have defined P2W for you, and you are ignoring that question and asking stupid questions.
---
You got what was promised. Wild Appalachia and Nuclear Winter add ons were free. Wastelanders will be free.
---
That's nice, shill. Stop supporting bad business practices.
---
You've conflated common shares and preferred shares. Not all shares have voting powers, many people buy stock as a means for dividend as opposed to for voting abilities.
---
I’m guessing they scrapped their bulk first. That’s what I did.
---
IIRC it spawns only if you launched a nuke at an area that ISNT a fissure site.
---
Sigh.
---
Passionate displeasure from a few... many who self admit they don’t play fallout or ones mad at the world who uninstalled it and now don’t play. 
---
I saw the same thing with fridges and collectrons and like that outrage this will pass as well. 
---
I’m not worried about it at all since it doesn’t effect gameplay.
---
What he hell does science have to do with this piece of shit game? Lmao
---
How about a level 42 who hoarded junk and crafts 100 turrets to light up the level 42 2nd class player O_o
---
It’s pay to win dude
---
I bought the game a while back out of boredom. I thought it could not be as bad as everyone thought. Man, was I wrong. It's like playing Fallout 4 but without all the cool features. I'm mad I wasted money on it, and now this subscription bullshit for a shitty game that they know is shitty. That is next level assholery.
---
I still like this game, but I’ve stuck with games that made similar decisions to this before. They never came back. I refuse to stay aboard another sinking ship.
---
Radio silence.
---
I do agree it is subjective, but since its goal is entertainment and just like you could go see a movie you hate you wasted X amount for X time. I was talking strictly in entertainment value. 
---
Oh I could play a game for 5 hours and feel like I got my money's worth but for entertainment value it was crap. I probably could have phrased it better in my first comment.  Also yes if you have 100 hours in FO4 and you bought the season pass you got a great return to entertain you. Maybe I look at this to logically for value/worth compared to passionately like others.
---
#It is adequate
---
 Chemist gives you twice as much and Super Duper can do that again.
---
Maybe theyre keeping the shitty game you're playing going.
---
Congratulations on financially supporting the worst excesses of corporate greed just so you can arrive at the exact same conclusion as everyone else.
---
Maybe next you should donate to ISIS so you can learn they're a terrorist organization from their weekly newsletter.
---
I love it because you can literally see in the pictures in the atom shop that it doesn’t have the hair. Bethesda is literally showing that they know it doesn’t have hair when placed and puts those pictures in anyway
---
Freemium games are one that don't cost anything to play, but contain elements of P2W (or something close to that).
---
It's the 'free' part that you're mixing up.  76 isn't free in any sense of the word.
---
Griefing other people is certainly a bad thing to do. Mostly because you have to play the actual game.
---
$100 subscription seems to be the standard... ESO, World of Tanks and more...
---
First definition fits perfectly 
---
&gt;an accomplice of a hawker, gambler, or swindler who acts as an enthusiastic customer to entice or encourage others.
---
I would've picked up outer worlds regardless. I don't need to hate another game to like outer worlds
---
Melee weapons while you’re farming for ammo.
---
Use your secondary ranged weapons that use ammo you don’t normally use. 
---
Tell me how I haven’t taken the Ammo Factory in over six months and yet I’m selling about 10k of 5.56 ammo (along with a smattering of other types) each week?
---
Can we move stuff now in private worlds?
---
Your broke ass is salty as fuck lmao
---
I recognized that username, they’re a weird fanboy who tries to act smarter than anyone criticizing Bethesda. Imagine defending 1st Pass and thinking you’re smart, ugh, their mind
---
because its not worth the effort for the massive fap that is internet trolls.  is the concept of a review bomb that foreign to you?
---
 seriously read like half of the reviews and you can tell whats being bombed and what isnt.  next to none hit actually issues.
---
Ever done experiments before kid?
---
You cannot build 100 turrets, turret number is limited to 20, and anyone can build them up easily.
---
Working turrets is the answer. But they would have to charge you extra for it. Maybe with Fallout 'Seconds' or Fallout 'the third'.
---
To be honest, I feel like they have effectively broken their own game. I don't see 76 recovering from this, which is really sad. I'm not some *butthurt hater,* I actually loved the game and wanted to see it succeed. 
---
I genuinely have no hope left for the game. I'm taking **another** break from the game to see if Bethesda sorts this out **again**, but I really don't see it happening.
---
Open up your eyes child, you are not "everyone else".
---
You opened up by calling me a troll, how hypocritically unaware are you that youd think to say something about getting butthurt and name calling? Secondly, nobody uses "twas" unless they're being pretentious, so at least do yourself and everyone else a favor by never using it again.
---
It's a solid rpg with fps elements of a hybrid rpg fps made 5+ years ago.
---
So video games are a lifestyle to you or your job? If its something you do for pleasure to pass the time that you enjoy that’s a hobby.
---
No I closed fallout 76 and downloaded The Outer Worlds for 2$. See I have some god damn sense compared to you. I figured that paying 2$ for Xbox Game Pass for a month and getting access to countless whole games as well as TOW was a better deal than paying 18$ to play the same buggy incomplete game that I’ve already paid 80$ for.
---
It's been fine for me.... But I'm still gun shy.  I grab all my junk when I leave the world.
---
I did have an empty scrap box, and noticed that after I scrapped a small cooking stove, it put the scrap into my scrap box, not onto my charecter. 
---
Has it always done that?  I guess I haven't noticed.
---
If I really knew this is the kind of player base Fallout 76 will have, I never would have bought it.
---
Enjoy throwing your wallet to Todd Howard's feet.
---
This is funny, don’t let the fanboys make you think otherwise. Weird too cause a lot of these same usernames popped up in my post critical of Bethesda, lil sus
---
Haters gonna hate. Ignore them.  Listen to people who can give reasonable arguments only - the rest can go to Hell for all I care.
---
That's an incredibly defeatist outlook. Assuming that everybody on /r/gaming purchased FO76 (they didn't, obviously), then if 200,000+ people went from "I'm going to buy this for $100/year" to "I'm not going to purchase this", that's a $20 million annual difference. They're not going to put the effort and manpower (money) into developing something which isn't profitable.
---
Also, I didn't say "If /r/gaming stopped buying these sorts of things". I said if general people stopped buying these sorts of things they would go away. /r/gaming is in no way unique regarding this matter and the idea of "I'll just test it out, it's only $13" ignores the cumulative effect such actions hold.
---
You got some real nerve questioning my intelligence, coming from the guy who doesnt even know the difference between/how to fucking use YOU'RE properly. For your statement/run on sentence to be correct, you wanted YOUR, NOT YOU'RE. That being said, I think we found the dumbass.
---
Except this sub is almost entirely sceptical of all this shit. Just look at your own up votes. It's preaching to the quire while telling ourselves that we're a brave minority standing up to a fanbase of shills. Come on, you can all do better than that.
---
No, it's as I described. The $10 one is just console, $15 is for both.
---

I like rpgs and I like giving them a chance before passing judgement. Sorry.
---
Lol you should stick to Fortnite. Leave 76 for us people who can hold a conversation :)
---
All hail his divine light!
---
I remind everyone Skyrim is still not backwards compatible.
---
The irony... YouTubers for the most part do it for money and drama creates views... views makes money... people watching them help them make money to make a video about a company making money... go figure... 
---
Sorry but a lot don’t buy in to monitized videos and many more don’t watch discovery vids because they like to figure out the game themselves.
---
700+ hours and still having fun!
---
Mostly giving you a hard time, played with a kiwi so it came up a lot. Water too for some reason. Anyways, take your fancy 'ours and... split like a leaf, yeah.
---
It’s amazing how far you boys are willing to go to defend this. You all must have the nerd rage perk maxed
---
If you go to the US and buy something of value you must declare it to customs when you arrive back home and then you will pay the taxes.
---
Usually customs won't bother billing you for small things, but that is a matter of practicality, not principle.
---
Taxes are how we pay for civilisation.  Avoiding them is evil.
---
So why are you still here bothering us?
---
Iirc you have to complete the Enclave missions before you can actually launch a nuke. 
---
By that time you already found the Overseers chest. 
---
But maybe i’ve missed a shortcut.
---
With or without the 1650 Atoms?
---
100$ a year not defending it, but people are spinning it to be worst then it really is.. Like any MMO out there, you pay for the game and the sub. for wow you can pay up to 155$+ a year, like wise for FFXIV and it is mandatory not optional like it is here... I don't agree with the how they priced it not with its concept.. 
---
people or rather drama pushers are playing waaay more awful then it it really is.
---
Vote with your money and voice your concerns but resorting to belittling another person or harassing others for not agreeing with what you believe in is not helping your cause.
---
Not talking directly at you its just in general the tone of this thread is very toxic
---
Thanks, but u missed my point. I'm just saying it was a better idea to make something like a battle pass/ranking model where u can either grind or pay.
---
I thought of that, but it is worth my word getting out there.
---
I know, thanks.  You're not so bad yourself.
---
🤷‍♂️ called you a troll cuz that's what you were being. Rude and uncouth. I'm not butthurt at all. Twas you and thine own ego who started it. Fare thee well fine rapscallion.
---
Did you aspire to work at seaworld as a whale trainer growing up? And when did you give up on your dreams and settled for whale's bitch?
---
Battlefield entices players back with free content updates, fallout uses the buy more platform.
---
Come on street pusher 101: Get the customer addicted first then raise the price.  Should have gave everyone a free taste of private world limited time only minus the atoms points. One the community helps debug, and two you seem to not be only in for the cash. Then add the price at the release of wastelanders. BAM
---
Thank you! Thank you! May his radiance forever shine upon us!
---
I agree with most of it but I genuinely don't understand the Pete bit, he said content would be free dlcs etc which they have been but the service they're offering isn't
---
Oof sorry, are you a Pittsburghian?
---
That's why I never bought this shit show
---
Minnow?
---
They’re keeping it shitty. If they didn’t accept dog shit, Bethesda would have to actually put out good content at a fair price.
---
18k is just laughable compared to r/Fallout and even this sub. If you think Bethesda are going to continue developing a game for 18k people, you are either naive or just stupid. 20000 x $10 = 200k each month. That is not even enough for a new Tesla for Todd. 
---
Again - it is just laughable.
---
You're not going to get rid of the whales completely, but you can mitigate the damage it does to the industry. A game community with whales and a compliant playerbase is rife for exploitation via microtransactions and other anti-consumer practices. They can keep ratcheting up the requirement to do those microtransactions and are incentivized to do so, because it makes them more profitable.
---
If the general playerbase isn't compliant and stops playing because the game is too exploitative, eventually the whales will leave too because the game is dead. There may be some zombie effect as a few whales remain, but the overall effect will be limited.
---
I highly reccomend it. Imagine a Fallout game, but made by the original creators of Fallout, except its in space with some Mass Effect features mixed in.
---
Me too, that's why I find fun popping some Rad-X and walking around as a wanderer and roleplaying.
---
Being a satisfied customer isnt the same as an accomplice. You say shill because you cant make an actual argument.
---
Seperate bundles should be a thing.
---
It’s protected under the First Amendment and parody laws. 
---
No reasonable person would conclude that that site is being presented by Bethesda.
---
Hell yea thats what we want Bethesda
---
&gt;The problem is that a membership migh have, MIGHT HAVE been accepted if  for example it came out simultaneously with the wastelanders dlc, and  cost significantly less, I don't know maybe around 5$ a month.
---
I know it's not exactly what you were proposing, but this train of thought lead me down a tangential path; as shameful as the current monetization scheme is, I really hope they don't reduce the subscription cost down after this uproar, because that to me would signal that Bethesda has adopted one of the most insidious and manipulative monetization practices going around today. I'm not sure if there's a name for it; I'm tempted to call it "the reverse bait &amp; switch", but it's becoming more and more common these days, and pretty much universally with monetization schemes.
---
Unlike the bait &amp; switch, where you dangle something appealing then swap it with something crap at the last minute, the reverse bait &amp; switch is where you present something repugnant, then give the appearance of listening to your consumers by replacing it with something marginally more appealing to widespread praise, whilst still getting away with more than you would have if you had lead with the second option first.
---
If Bethesda drops the subscription cost down to $5 now, they'd probably do so to thundering applause. However, I would be suspicious that they had planned that all along; that $5 was their goal price, and that by hiking it up then dropping it, they were able to get the price they wanted, lock away private servers, modding potential, unlimited scrap etc. behind a paywall, and get praised for doing it.
---
That is a really good idea!
---
Lmaoooo no way you’re serious. Anyway, I am sticking to fortnite, a game that listens to its community, has consistent updates to prevent the game from being an unstable piece of shit, has actual good cosmetics available, offers a battle pass to keep people invested (which 76 SHOULD’VE DONE! It helped bring red dead Online back from the dead!). Yeah, I’ll stick to that 💅
---
But having said that. I payed for the game and will still probably play it on and off. Im just not putting anymore than that into the machine.
---
Going public without exception ruins good companies. Wish the stock market was gone.
---
It's amazing how much you want to win this argument that you failed to win kiddo.
---
yup, me 2.
---
Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!
---
I think the map is cool, the lore is fun, everything else has been awful and makes me hope they just stop what they are doing and go back to making fun instead of money. The money would have come, but now they just come off as a bad friend (or jerk that I knew) If they keep this up I'll see them as the crazy ex.
---
In my experience even this sub has turned against Bethesda.
---
honestly, this is the most toxic sub i've ever followed. i really only check it at this point because the drama is so funny at times.
---
You are feigning enthusiasm over getting fake currency in a game with less content than the game it stole 95% of the assets from to buy things that should be free
---
I had it installed on my D: drive, however when it auto-updated it updated a new install to the C: drive and uninstalled the original one on the D: drive.   (Not sure if that's your issue, but thought I'd mention it as it may have moved itself to another drive.)
---
You’re not helping
---
Damn Bethesda’ dick must taste pretty good to you huh?
---
YES HOLY CRAP, sorry, im just a Texan Native, and Texas has no lore whatsoever and it is perfect place for a fallout story.
---
"Because all of the assholes jumped ship when the game was 'kinda' broken."
---
"Kinda" is a massive understatement.
---
Lies, a quick history check shows tou been bitching since day 1.   Quit already.
---
I’m probably older than you, guy. I’m smarter by default cause I’m not defending 1st Pass lol
---
I checked what this was monthly for me, and after my New York state sales tax, it would be $14.14 a month. Having a British spouse, I can confirm American banks don't "speak" to other nations' banks the same way banks, say, within the EU or EEA do. Transferring money between us costs extra money. Maybe your non-American banks are making Bethesda pay more and they are trying to recover a loss in banking funds and/or it's your VAT.
---
I didn't know we had salt mines here in Appalachia
---
Look making the map 4 times the size of fallout 4 was really great  but make it much bigger and ad npc well dame take my money wait no not my money umm my caps
---
Never lose hope, I felt a bit of despair after the announcement, but then I remembered *Wastelanders.* and that is the thing that is keeping me going for this community.
---
This post will selfdestruct in 5 minutes.
---
&gt; They sell you a $60 game and then let you pay more to not play it -Yahtzee
---
I dont mean this subreddit. I mean the game star forum and the world of players forum.
---
Honestly meta critic is not a good platform same as steam reviews. Too many review bombings and stuff. Same if smth gets hyped that isnt that great. One of the key factors to me is immersion, a vivid world. When i read the comments about static npcs and a world that feels un natural because of putting together different bioms in a small place, that puts me rly off.
---
For example Witcher 3,has a rly good story and dialogs/cutscenes. But the world itself feels not vivid, doesnt rly get my commitment in exploring it all, cause side areas are not rly that interesting. A lot of sidequest are good, but mostly their cutscenes and stories that are interesting, not the gameplay or place itself there.
---
The exact opposite is skyrim, i dont rly care about the mainstory, but exploring the world is super exciting, cause it is a vivid world. There can happen a lot of random shit in it. Also the Sidequest are pretty fun and you get to do a lot of unique stuff.
---
You get two types of people:
---
-The “White Knights” that tell you the game has gotten so much better, and that Fallout 1st is worth it due to the features, even though all of that shit should have been like this since launch.
---
And
---
-Logical, reasonable people
---
Unfortunately there are less of the latter that are vocal on here.
---
How can they do that? If you turn friendly fire off no one can attack you?
---
Sure the Atoms bonus is nice. But for the lower subscription price, maybe lower it to 1000 or something.
---
In many ways, in game currency is totally worthless and I would rather accept the option for straight up real world currency to be used to buy items or do challenges that gives you the specific item you want.
---
Why don’t you try some of spacer’s choice koolaide, it’s calm, refreshing, and guaranteed to get the salt out of your mouth.

No, I struggled to set up a small two man company, fed myself and later my wife and children as cheaply as I could, grew the business then sold it for a few millions.  Just working my way to retirement now playing video games for fun.  Kids are set for life, I've got retirement homes on multiple continents, found a new hobby talking to people who obsess about marine mammals.

yeah, like sort of a scavenger faction trying to break into impenetrable Fort Knox.

---
I find it hard to believe that the majority complaining do not play the game. Its funny how unified this subreddit is, and has been, for so long yet this one incident seems to have split everyone straight down the middle. 
---
So would you say that people that were complimenting the game also had a strong number on non-players who would just merely join the crowd through rose-tinted glasses? 
---
Its not fair to just assume that someone who has a genuine point to prove while being disgruntled is a non-player.
---
Now with this comment you might be an old guy with a childish behaviour, which is worse lol.
---
So what you're saying is that anyone who has ever bought atoms or any skin in any game at all is a "shill"? You're funny.
---
I'm assuming you are discarded genetic material made sentient, not assuming your genetic material made sentient. "Your" is possessive as in your sad attempt to sound smart but only sounding even more dumb. Lol nice try
---
That's exactly what I said, dumbass. Yet you fucktards kept feeding Bethesda and made them greedier.
---
Kind of like a barter system? I can see that happening.
---
I’m personally done, I’ll see what the consensus on Wastelanders is, *maybe* pop in to see it, but otherwise, there’s better games out there
---
Hey there! I’m on Xbox, gamer tag is Splaishe. Happy to give you a handful of stimpacks, water, and go along the occasional quest! I don’t use my mic though because I usually only play when my fiancée is asleep next to me, so I can only talk via text or emotes. 
---
I’d also love to make you some weapons :) but to make it fun maybe I could send you on a “quest” to get the materials, lol. Anywho, hope to see you around.
---
I 100% agree with you, they indeed did “fuck everything up” and they should have made it a lot cheaper, right  now its more expensive than PS+ which you need to be able to even play AT ALL, this is such bullshit
---
Advantage against people who don't pay, is called pay to win.
---
“This sub is full of despicable people who only hurl insults” “Or are you just plain fucking idiots”
---
&gt;ass rape jokes. 
---
&gt;bit cringe and homophobic? 
---
&gt;Dude make several references to getting pounded in the ass
---
&gt;Like what’s the worst and angriest thing I can think up? Oh yeah buttsex.
---
If the point you're not making is that butt sex = homophobia, you're going to want to rewrite quite a bit of your comment.
---
Agreed, but Bethesda did it in a very stupid way, with absolutely terrible timing.
---
Oh I full well am. And it has made me realize how much of a dumpster fire Fallout 76 has turned into, because of idiots like you all.
---
It's especially hilarious since Outer Worlds is just your average generic story on rails with specifics zones you can explore in a scripted environment shooter.
---
You specifically dont have to do it tho. You just have to be on a server where it happened. If you see someone nuke whitesprings, for example, then you can pick it up from any silo afterward.
---
And private servers, I didn't exclude that.  It's basically what people are paying for now., but the non paying player gets a little taste.
---
Its really the only multiplayer game i still play other than street fighter.
---
Not just those people. I had somewhere between 450lbs and 600lbs of scrap and lost it all. I did have hundreds of many items but not thousands and certainly not thousands of pounds. I lost mine on XBox changing from a private sever to a public adventure server. My game did not crash. My junk just disappeared. It is really gone I can not craft anything at a workstation so it is definitely all gone.
---
I like how you say that this sub is nothing but insults but,you proceed to insult people who pay for fallout first.hypocrite much?
---
You cant even use those words correctly. You suck.
---
Nobody does mtx at a fair price, they haven't for so long mtx are institutionalized at a shitty price. They're all overpriced. But Wastelanders was supposed to be free and the good content.  They should've pushed back subs w the release of Wastelanders
---
big word hurt grug brain. grug use purple arrow.
---
 Not for the vast majority, that's for sure. You guys and the fucking dupers really fucked up the game. I used to log in and see how taking water from a hand pump worked, to see if that session was being fucked with. I did this for quite a long time and am still pissed.
---
Made my base here today. Thanks for the tip! The Halloween smoke machine looks so good among the graves, I just wish the mothman bundle came back to the atom shop so I could get the black smoke too.
---
Welcome to reddit.
---
Owen loves his Mama!
---
Someone called me twat once when I was playing football. Want me to give you his email address for proof?
---
The filthy casuals server. Basically the place where people went to to genuinely talk about the game whenver this server is brigaded. Strict "No vitriol. No bashing. No complaining, even about the people on this Sub. Only talk about the game and your fun experiences" and it worked out so far.   
---
Sometimes coming here isn't very fun. And it's nice to have a place to talk about how you met an irl senior citizen in the game playing with his grandkids whenever controversy or non-controversy gets people here in a rage. Or a new patch comes out, and people want to talk about what it broke.
---
None of this surprises me you're a living stereotype whale bitch
---
I’m a woman, thanks but I would reserve “childish” for the people thinking this greed is at all okay. Like you have to be a child to play fallout and not pick up on ANY of the subtext. No wonder you see so many fanboys unironcially quoting liberty prime lmaoooo
---
How many AAA games with p2w do you know?
---
Nah, that is a fallout first exclusive, for an additional $0.50 though.
---
Well, I don’t know about you but SBQs make me burn through .50s and 5mms like crazy. 
---
I used to farm ammo while using melee weapons but it has become quite difficult lately. People learned every decent spot and The Ammo Factory is always contested. And let’s face it, trying to do PvP with a melee weapon is just suicide.
---
That’s very helpful to know! Personally haven’t been able to find the pesky log myself at the Silos so I assumed I had to be part of the team to do it.
---
No shit. This was obvious from the get go, and you seem to be proud of the arguments you had with people who aren't shortsighted morons. It's not the first step in a slippery slope, it's about 11 months down that slope at this point. You and a majority of this sub are the perfect example of why this shit is even allowed to happen in the first place. It's like the events of the prior months never happened and you are living completely in the moment, like the mental capacity of fuckin dogs. And not even smart dogs like Alaskan Shepards, who would actually learn, but Beagles the dumbest of the dumb.
---
But they are clearly using predatory practices. I’ve played a few Bethesda games, including this one. Something happened to them along the way because it’s almost as if they are a different company now. I have almost 400 hours in FO76, and even after the nice patch a few month back that made it playable, it is STILL broken. At this point there is no argument. If you have fun that’s fine. However, trying to say what their doing isn’t greed-driven, scandalous, and immorally wrong, is just being in denial. I had fun for a while, until the broken mechanics were holding me back from actually having fun. It’s a shame, but these are the cards Bethesda dealt us.
---
Radscorpion claws would be pretty neat.
---
Honestly nothing changes if you don’t get it outside of not getting the atoms or the emotes. As for the outfit - I have a feeling it will be available for all soon enough. 
---
Yes you don’t get a scrap box but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ if you weren’t dying from scrap limitations before you won’t now?
---
Nothing changed per se just new paid features were added.
---
Chior* sorry xx
---
I am a sub and i hope they dont make this a pay for 4-5 star Gear. That will ryin the game, i understand paying for your own server but not for 4-5 star gear.
---
Something over looked about the tent is its indestructible in pvp as well. I had someone square off on me and in their tent youre forced to get in their field of vision to fight back. The tent should be destructible and repairable just like a camp.
---
Hello, you should make a paid Fallout 76 dlc playing in china where everything is censored.
---
You must have a lot of patience to play SF online
---
I'll buy your one way plane ticket to China. Maybe if I slip the pilot a $20 he will boot you out the back with nothing but a parachute so you can get the full experience.
---
So, I've been away from this game for quite a while, I was planning on coming back but since I'm already packed, I'm never ever going to play this game again
---
Thats is true, hard to get into at the start if you don’t spend any money on plat but perfectly doable none the less.
---
Good point.
---
It wouldn't matter if it wouldn't be p2w.
---
You pretty much put my thoughts about it into words. That’s not to say I haven’t been enjoying it, but it’s definitely no Fallout, like people have been selling it as.  
---
It reminds me more of Borderlands/Mass Effect, or something in that FPS realm.
---
&gt; "P2W" is a loose term. It doesn't necessarily mean pay to *win* literally.
---
It means "something I want but I don't want to pay for so nobody else should have it.  Whaaa!"
---
#pwned
---
I would LOVE the OG Wattz Laser Rifle
---
Ok thanks for the info. I have yet to launch a private server nor access scrap stash from there (jumping back and forth) and have ~700 lbs of scrap; have yet to lose it or see any display issue with the items in it.
---
If you want a private server - this is just like minecraft realms but in its infancy. 
---
If you want the atoms or the outfit well you get other stuff too. 
---
Could have been better but the controversy misses the real mark imho.
---
Yes, SBQs take a lot of ammo. But that’s separate from gathering/crafting ammo. 
---
I have no issues with running the first section of a silo with just a melee weapon or even running Lucky Hole without firing a shot.
---
I'm not gay, I'm deeply closeted. Get it right, scrub.

A lot of mine was also purchased from player vendors so I am out a ton of caps. If they can not restore our junk I think they should at least give us 25,000 caps so we can try to purchase new junk. I lost some stable flux which was expensive but I did not have very much. The things that I am most upset about losing are hundreds of screws, gears, springs, aluminum and lead. These are all things I use all the time and are a bit hard to get. Hopefully the issue is really resolved so it does not happen to anyone in the future.
---
How do people still defend this company’s actions with the “product(s)” they continue to put out for it?
---
&gt; We are talking about getting an advantage over other players by paying.
---
How can you have an advantage over other players in a noncompetitive game?
---
I'll spend my money on whatever I damn well please to.
---
You responded with this and believe you’re at all smart? Yikesssss
---
I bet you quote liberty prime unironically
---
Bethesda is a billion dollar company already getting money from atom sales, game sales, and creation club LMAO
---
&gt; P2W is a common term for content in games that is locked behind a pay wall.
---
What  like DLC?
---
They should just roll back the nerf to legendary spawns they implemented some time ago. No one was asking for that. They could also roll back the nerf to atom drops for new players, and the nerf to led drops while they are at it. Oh and the collector robot stealth nerf was also not warrented.
---
I mean you did say “no one is calling you anything.” I gave you evidence that yes indeed people are calling 1st members these things. Don’t know what more you’d need to see but ok sure
---
No. Bethesda simply ignored it. They dont really care. Its all about money in the end anyway. 
---
I am not surprised game did get sub, but I am surprised by how did that happened and how little it offers. Game was bugged from the start. Any new update created more new bugs. No real content that would expand gaming experience (thats a year after release!!). And they did dare to put a sub on the game that actually has nothing more to offer at this moment, with content that doesnt really give anything (not to mention is broken). As much as I played, for over two months I did not log in. I was hoping for Wastelanders soon being released, but as we all see that wont happen anytime soon.
---
To be honest, I am surprised anyone actually did buy the sub! 
---
If they would make all things right, and sub would offer so much more than maybe it would be worth it. But as they say “If ifs and buts where candy and nuts...”
---
It started before then, remember the Christmas bundle that was discounted without even having a base price? I don't think that was even the beginning but I'd have to look it up.
---
My first thoughts while playing was that I would rather be playing New Vegas. So I did but the game can be quite fun.
---
I played off and on with some bodies with every new update. Each of us have about maybe 14 hours put in. Most of the people that bought the game don't have much more than that. Because news flash... There is nothing to do. I am amazed that there are people that have hundreds of hours in the game. Like what do they do? I don't even have guns. I just use melee weapons because ammo is impossible to find, and wood is the easiest resource to part with for repairing.
---
It's not hard to decide to make a full game, release it on release day, and NOT make people pay a monthly fee for it.
---
The issue is when game companies release an unfinished game, make you pay for more content (thereby eventually getting you the amount of content a full game should have) and also lock things behind a monthly membership that just makes the game unenjoyable to play without. Sure, Private Servers aren't quite that yet, but what happens when they add more to Fallout 1st and then playing the game without its membership is just not fun, and you get to see all these people who DO pay for it with all these features you want? 
---
There is a fine line between releasing paid DLC for a finished game, that is fun on its own, and paid DLC for a buggy mess of a game that doesnt even feel like the devs tried that hard on it. One gives you more of what you love. One gives you a full game for 2, 3 times the standard $60 price tag on most games.  The route Bethesda is taking with Fallout 76 and Fallout 1st is encouraging them and other devs to make unfinished games and lock the rest of the game behind post-Day-one updates and paid DLC and memberships. Thats what frustrates me. Its not that they have a paid membership at all, or that they locked private servers behind it. I really dont care about that. Its the future of games like this that upsets me.
---
I wasn’t assuming you gender, only that your a slave to greedy corps
---
Lol... Mate, i'm not happy with Bethesda's decisions either, nor will I ever defend that shit, but I don't see this sub trying to convince anyone of these 5 examples. A couple trolls here and there *MAYBE*, but not "this sub" as you've so generally put it.
---
You cannot win the the arguement so you just spin off to another unrelated one, clever, but not quite enough, just shows how weak you are, not able to admit mistakes or reason with reason.
---
I am actually keen on seeing you keep doing this because that's such a stupid thing to do lol
---
It os a known issue, since they "fixed" it couple of patches ago. Also issued another "fix" after that. Yet the problem remains.
---
Also, please don't hate me, those are the facts.
---
What fucking "advantage"?
---
Were you here last Wednesday?
---
&gt;if the battle pass included solely cosmetics nobody would have a problem with it
---
Didn't people freak out about a combat knife reskin?
---
Lmfao that's why they had to practically give away the fuckin game almost right after release, because you're the majority and everyone secretly loves the game. Even my friend who played it non-stop, even using multiple characters on multiple computers to get party bonuses, has the same shit to say about it as everyone else and doesn't play anymore because it's such milquetoast garbage.
---
I love America!
---
You seem like a masochist, sell your rights to a sweatshop in Indonesia since you love companies staying alive by exploiting for profit
---
I think you meant to type "false dilemma," but my point was that they wouldn't be taking such a drastic shift unless they believed there weren't any alternatives.
---
&gt;  it’s almost as if they are a different company now
---
Providence Equity Partners invested a few hundred million dollars in zeni, so likely they're calling a lot of the shots now.
---
I spent my first day on private worlds looking for legendaries and only saw them during events where they are guaranteed to spawn. Watoga, West Tek (spelling?), and the golf course had not a single legendary spawn.  I actually got on here to see if anyone else was having the same problem.
---
Okay but... this isnt what I asked. I asked what keeps you guys interested in the game at this point.
---
I lapped you intellectually about a mile back so it doesn't require any belief on my part. And you're just mad because you couldn't afford that power armor skin either. Lol
---
Gave you An up vote because you play just how I have. I think we are obsessed with what the company does to it's players (lie, rip off, sell broken over priced add ins)
---
It could be literally anything, pvp, pve, storage space, etc.
---
I'm not actually saying you're wrong in your explanation, I'm just playing devils advocate that the money spent on a game can't always be attributed to entertainment. More so in that you can't subject someone to what you consider a proper level of acceptable entertainment.
---
Op apparently hasn't enjoyed the game given the way he ended his post.
---
I never bought the season pass but I do have the DLCs, but haven't played them yet.  I do enjoy the game but given it's been out a few years now and I have only 100 hours, I'm not sure if I feel like I got my moneys worth however, the limited number of hours isn't because I'm not enjoying it.
---
I might just be getting me a tent tonight lol
---
Like I dont need to assume you're an idiot
---
*Smdh*
---
It’s a shame what these publishers and investors do to the developers, the people who see the games they create the way we play them. Not sure if I am even going to buy ESVI or SF at this point, never thought I’d type or speak that.
---
Lol. I haven't heard anyone calling each other bootlickers so far, thats funny.
---
The timing was indeed awful. If Wastelanders released and was well received, I think the premium service in turn would have been better received.
---
I was, and I recall this sub being a bunch of pissed off people, not people sticking up for the dumb decisions Bethesda made.
---
Ok, I never said you couldn't. I just said you're an idiot for doing so, so dumb you are actually negativity impacting the industry, and arguing with people who were factually correct.
---
How about neither side call each other anything?
---
Right? They're not even gaining anything, just wasting ammo.
---
I mean its possible that it's not instanced by player and someone else snagged the holotape before you could, but i got it before ever even launching a nuke myself, so i know you at least dont need to personally do it.
---
Okay so this just isn't your type of game.
---
No, P2W refers to the advantages given by the developers/publishers of the game in question, not outside sources.
---
P2W in a PvP/competitive game would be like if there was a UFC fight, and one guy could pay to have brass knuckles.
---
For FO76, a more PvE oriented game (with a touch of PvP if you go looking for it), the developers have included disadvantages (item durability, survival mechanics) in the game only to later sell you a way to avoid or mitigate it (scrap/repair kits, the fridge, scrap bot, the infinite scrap stash). Imagine paying full price for a new phone, but to open the lock screen you have to view 5 minutes of advertisements unless if you pay extra. So the "winning" in this situation would be not having to wait 5 minutes to open your phone. P2W in Fallout 76 is any advantage set by the developers that you can pay extra for, especially if you can only get it by paying for (such as the Fallout 1st subscription).
---
I'm sure you've won a lot of arguments calling people idiots.  Blocklist++
---
This is what pisses me off the most. Not just that BugthEsdA is ruining their own game in order to milk those few left playing it, but the fact that so many are bending over forwards and saying "Please daddy Todd, fuck me harder" like damn. I decided to give this game a chance and came to love playing it. But whenever anyone makes criticisms or suggestions in order to improve the game, you know, make it better for all of us, they get called toxic haters and are downvoted into oblivion. Many of us made the slippery slope argument and they told us we were being toxic and ridiculous...yet here we are, watching a game we enjoy get fucked over by its devs for a quick buck, while many cheer on.  
---
Ah well rant over, guess some of us now know what it must have felt like to be a BioWare fan back before that went to shit.
---
Because I wanted to know what keeps you guys interested in the game still. I can't offer my opinion and ask for other people's?
---
Less weight in stash doesn't, more junk in it is another story. Junk which can be converted to ammo, sold etc. 
---
The stash argument doesn't stem from weight alone, don't forget it was mentioned with server stability.
---
A whale who eats no krill, is it a whale?
---
P.S. That word for a female dog?  You might think about what it makes you look like when you use it.
---
Yes I agree
---
 Im just a glutton for punishment.
---
Just Providence Equity ass*****s that threated Zenimax to make more short term profits or they leave with their money... And this disaster is one of theses consequences
---
If there was a radio I could build in my CAMP that played the Halloween music, I'd probably build a house made completely of Halloween station radios.  
---
Afterthought: No, I would not pay actual real world money for this feature.  
---
But it IS pretty good.
---
You asked it in a confrontational manner. Which I evidently cannot site, as your text has been removed.  It wasn't framed as "what do you enjoy" it was framed as "why are you doing that"
---
Quite frankly I don't see how the current practices are predatory nor would I qualify the remaining bugs in the game as broken.  The only bugs I have really seen in months is a server crash maybe once a 2hr nightly play session if at that and assholes with duped explosive lasers server hopping and PVPing the workshops.  Annoying yes but certainly not broken in any sense.

How old are you just out of curiosity? You sound like you still live with your parents. It’s makes sense seeing as you don’t know the value of money yet.
---
That's ok. Enjoy your ride on the hate bandwagon but it doesnt change the facts.
---
Phrasing. 
---
Boom.
---
It's sad that Bethesda does worse job on F76 than EA with BF2...
---
Well, they released Wild Appalachia, and Nuclear Winter for free, Wastelanders will be free too. Most of the game's expansion content has been free. The Atom Shop and Fallout 1st are the exceptions.
---
There are literal HUNDREDS of ftp mmos that survive PURELY on cosmetic cash shops. The difference is that those games are optimized properly, have tons of high quality content in the shops, and have fair prices, instead of $10-$20 for one thing....and yes, games need money to survive, but they also need to be held to a certain standard, and they need to to things to garner trust, and respect from their community.
---
It's ok man not everything is funny to all.  Maybe you had to be there and remember how stupid/huge it was at the time I dunno but for me it's funny.
---
We need to spread the word
---
I can understand this but there are massive sections of the current map that are basically empty and under utilized. I would like to see content fill out these areas and make them worth going to. Point Pleasant for instance is a place ripe for questing and exploring but there really isn't much there.
---
I already won the argument and even then it doesn’t matter. You’re a loser by default if you purchased 1st Pass or defend companies with your every breath. You can tell you’ve gotten more frustrated as you’ve gone on and when you found out I was a reeemale, woooo I’m sure that was a shot to your fragile incel worldview 😛
---
Nobody in this post called you anything.
---
Those people may well have done but just because THEY did don’t immediately assume that THAT is also my opinion on you.
---
I'd consider the fact anyone buying is as being a whale in the way that they can just buy stuff with no consideration of what they are getting or how much value it is. Base game was $60, now it less than 25, so to pay $26 for 2 months or $100 for one year of a couple features for said game shows no regard for your money IMO. I've spent tons of money on other games so I'm in no way against it, but this is just bad. Don't forget it's a SUBSCRIPTION, pay a year and it's gone after that. I'd feel a lot better if it was an unlock
---
Very well spoken - I seriously don’t know what kind of people are gathering here, probably bit of all. Kids who just don’t know better, lacking of virtues other than online credibility; grown ups who just don’t care about money and some likeminded who see the bigger picture behind all the scam Bethesda is offering us. 
---
Funny thing is I came from Battlefield because the community has been toxic from the beginning and found this sub pretty nice and helpful. But after Bethesda dropped the money nuke again after trying to earn back the community this sub turned into wasteland.
---
Maybe it’s just because people are frustrated how a great franchise gets ripped cause every studio wants to ride the fortnite train which is basically earn money fast with less effort cause people will always pay for the shortcut.
---
These studios know no other language than money, which is fair enough. But be sure that if you want your favourite game not to turn into a cashcow just don’t - buy - the - premium - items - period. No “I just want to look or give it a try” or “I want the game to be better”. There are no excuses for feeding the money trolls. You are the customer, you decide with your money.
---
Better private equity than public markets.
---
I dunno, but that probably cost what? $5?
---
A battles pass would be $10 for 70-100 items
---
Yet another top post is people harrasing people ingame for a 13$ purchase.
---
Okay but we don’t pay for new content.... it’s a fucking scrapbox &amp; private servers that are re-used &amp; can’t even be farmed properly.. I was pissed when I found out private servers were gonna be paid for but then I realized wtf is the point? The games literally meant to be played in Adventure we have vending machines for god sake. It’s not a big deal imo man &amp; it’s waaaay worth the measly $13 if you’re that upset about it. You get $15+ worth of atoms, an outfit, private servers &amp; the scrapbox. It’s totally worth it to me. I understand where you’re coming from but you’re a little loose with the logic. This isn’t new content in any form, Wastelanders &amp; every ACTUAL content update is free. There isn’t some badass weapon you get from Fallout 1st, no guaranteed legendary spawn or anything. It isn’t pay to win, so just don’t buy it &amp; play along😂
---
I'm lost. Where did they announce they'll be selling legendary gear in the Atom shop?
---
I don't understand 10 a month for a private session, it's not a private server. You have zero control of it
---
You are going to want to follow the story and head to Morgan airport once you have found the responders camp. Once at Morgan airport you should be able to find all sorts of things to do there that will help you create healing items, find healing items, and also a small back pack in the airport building, inside the over seers chest. As far as helping you, this is all I can do considering I am on pc. Good luck and remember to turn on your passive mode or you will get bullied.

Private as in I don't have to worry about other players contesting my workshops. Making faming resources easier for me and whom ever is on my friends list that wants to join.
---
Mine happened before the maintenance to the servers for this issue so hopefully it will not happen to anyone in the future. However, I had not gotten my scrap back as of 1:30am 10/27/19 and I have not been back on the game since. If I do get my scrap back I will post and let folks know. I started using the scrapbox again last night but I do not have much in it yet. I will definitely know if my stuff gets restored because like I said I had hundreds of screws and a few other items. I will also update here if I lose the new stuff that I put in my scrapbox since the maintenance to fix the issue.

I know that, hell i'm an accountant, it is my job to know that, but what I am saying is there is a tax on entertainment subscriptions in addition to the sales tax in Chicago.

Not that I think the 76 ship is being expertly captained, but ESO had a pretty rough first year. Look at it now. New Vegas also launched in just as bad a condition as 76, if not worse, and it’s praised as the best in the series. 
---
Maybe 76 will crash and burn, but certainly not for want of effort on the development team. 
---
Blame the investors, blame the parent company, blame a player base with a shitty attitude, take whatever side you like, but I think the folks in Austin are really trying to make lemonade out of a lemon.  It’s pretty admirable considering their fans have been nothing but critical at every turn.
---
I really "wanted" to buy this game... for the simple reason, Bethesda titles such as Skyrim/FO3-NV/Doom were a big part of what got me 'back' into gaming. I held off from pre-ordering FO76 for the usual reasons. I may have still purchased the game shortly after release and the subsequent price drop of 40%, had "It Just Worked".  Yet still, I held off from buying... Fast forward thru this past year with ALL Bethesda's mishaps (within the game itself, the PR disasters and Marketing villainy) and now "This" ! The Timing alone is terrible. Take into account the postponement of the Wastelanders, Bethesda decides making more money off an originally disastrous release is a good idea ? I'm gone Bethesda, thanks for the memories.
---
Yeah, now that you mention it. There was this whole thing because that's illegal in some countries so it was very quickly rescinded.
---
/r/fo76 / Bethesda's Sockpuppet Marketing Team: It's not dying you salty youtuber! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
So, you consider ‘winning’ to be avoiding any time or resource management bottlenecks?
---
Weird, I don't remember it being a CoD campaign.
---
I forget that the average redditor these days isn't old enough to have played iconic rpgs like fallout 1 &amp; 2 and bioshock in their hayday
---
I'm gonna laugh if they say npcs will only exist in private world's, only with Bethesda am I right?
---
workshop hopping a nice new way to power level alts also.
---
I win arguments by fully understanding what I'm talking about, and using facts. I don't get into an argument unless I know I'm right, because why else would I argue. Calling you an idiot was just something for me, I mean you are but it was also a good vent. Why are you telling me you are blocking me, just do it and move on instead of trying to get a final zinger when you are already defined as an idiot.
---
That's false advertising, they're talking about pay to win. The false advertising started before the game was even released, i.e. canvas bags.
---
*Claims to know all the glitches and exploits*
---
*Still sells junk on the marketplace*
---
Yeah, you’re bullshitting.
---
Zero evidence of any of this on Reddit, YouTube or the web.
---
But sure, I’ll believe some random dude who says it’s true **haha**
---
If you choose to see it as if you won the arguement, go with it, I have no responsibility in teaching you the reality, keep showing your stupididity to others and represent as a bad example of you anti sub crowds.
---
If there's someone at my CAMP, I'll always wait until they're gone before I log out.  
---
Last night I was having some connectivity issues, though (this was due to my internet connection getting spotty, not actually the F76 servers) and I got disconnected right as someone was buying a few plans. I felt bad about that, but at least my CAMP was on level ground (Twin Lakes area).
---
 No there aren't. There may be a few second rate games like that, hundreds you would have to list.
---
I don’t have an issue with Fallout 1st in any form. I mentioned the other day the only issue I had was the timing of it. They didn’t even advertise it or anything we found out DURING THE FUCKING MAINTENANCE.. They drop the bomb we all knew was coming with Wastelanders being delayed until possibly March 2020 then they drop a $13 membership which easily should’ve been $9.99 with less atoms. I’ll gladly take 1k atoms &amp; the rest of the stuff for $10 a month. Everyone knew when they announced private servers were coming that it’d be paid for like every other multiplayer game that allows you to host servers. I also think they should’ve given players who don’t buy 1st an option to buy the scrapbox maybe overpriced for about a week just to be more generous to our community. Idk man, they need some real people in BGS because rn we just got robots I haven’t even seen a BGS employee in the subs since this blew up.
---
Never seen these posts about it back then, but I wish I had. Would have kept me from buying originally.
---
Use English.
---
I'm not telling you what I consider to be winning or not, I'm telling you what the term "P2W" is. I'm not a linguist, I can't tell you why this term is as broad as it is. That's just how it's defined, basically.
---
No, nice try on the deflect, that isnt how you intended it.
---
I have a collectron and didn't pay for it.  It's from the free atoms I get daily for the past year. It still is easy to get 20-30 a day
---
Same
---
This game has given us a friendly Super-Mutant (Graham), a sentient Mole-Miner (Murmgrrh), I think Wastelanders will give us a Scorched vendor of some sort. It's inevitable.
---
I had a bug maybe 3 weeks back where it was letting me go over the stash limit. It was only letting me do that with junk, nothing else.  No clue how it worked, but it went away after a few days.
---
And there it is. So turns out you're not just dumb, you have no idea what you're talking about. Now I understand where the confidence comes from.
---
If anything were fallout 2nd's 
---
We get the 2nd's, the left overs that's not as good as what premium 1st members get ( or will get)
---
Damn, you got them man. What else does ESO have?
---
Most games that provide server hosting have a cost. It's not the cost of the server that bothers people, well some people it does, it's the scap box,  increased camp budget, and a second FT that comes with it. People are upset about features that they'd be forced to pay for if they wanted them, that aren't just cosmetic and they aren't earnable in game via atom points.
---
Kwiyor?
---
My camp is usually set up by Gorge junkyard, I run the hills east of the railroad grabbing firecaps and soot flowers all the way to slocum joes, then follow the river grabbing all the bloodleaf and snaptails  south thru flatwoods and then east to the river and up thru point pleasant. With green thumb, chemist and superduper I usually end up with over 200+ healing salve, 50+ disease cure and 30+ mothman omelettes. The healing salve sells to train station vendors and cleans them out of caps...
---
Private server, as in my PC is the server and people I invite play the game on my PC, are not even possible at this point. And this is what people were asking for. People that are smart enough to throw money into Bethesdas´way to get the stuff that was usually in single player games and then argue, that the "private servers", that are just temp server connections and not on your machine... yeah... you guys deserve this.
---
whats your gamertag?
---
Read the rest of the post.
---
I hate to break it to you but there is zero advantage. Oh, you have a tent? So what, I have a camp, and do the same thing for a few caps. And I have basically infinite storage anyway because I have alts.  And as you pointed out, playing in private renders vending machines pointless so its not an advantage really.
---
That is a VERY good question. I think you should also ask if there are license and fees that are required to be paid in order to sell/has subscription services in said countries. I wonder if there is a bigger picture and more too it then just simple math.
---
thanks! i just added u on xbox. tell me when u’ll be on!
---
The fuck? Is this the only fallout you’ve played??
---
Im still waiting on someone to show/share a prior post about this from here, since its not relevant and all, according to your insinuation. Not everyone seen or heard about it, didnt know I wasnt allowed to share relevant FO76 info in a FO76 Mr Reddit officer.
---
Well warranted
---
Did I say I was going somewhere?
---
Wasnt there a event with Fallout world superheroes in February?
---
Costume granted 15 health to every squad member for each unique costume up to 5x bonus.
---
Sunk cost fallacy, "I've put too much time and effort into the game to abandon it, I just have to hope it gets to a point where it was worth it!"
---
I'd go to the river near the Vault-Tec agricultural center in Flatwoods. You can collect the ingredients to make healing salve and fight robots for steel and lead scrap to make ammo. You could also head up to Point Pleasant and get a decent amount of ammo clearing out scorched.
---
Not an exploit, people pay $13 a month for it
---
$50*
---
Overseer's Journey, is just collecting the Overseer's personal holotapes. Each one has a clue to the next. The last holotape, is a bit of a cliffhanger, so likely there'll be more when Wastelanders come out.
---
The issue is that if you and I both do the Lucky Hole, without firing shots, I will have ~2x the amount of ammo compared to you, because I had the Factory at the same time. So I can then kill more mobs, farm more legendaries, get more XP, etc. That is if I am in a private server and you are not.  Not to mention the fact that other players can interfere and ruin your runs / events. And it is all designed to be like that. So you can pay to skip it. Like in a mobile game that costs $0. Fallout 76 costs $60 and came out more broken than any other game in the history of gaming.
---
Not one of us -- 30% price hike.
---
huge difference between this and eso plus though to me at least. an MMO practically needs a subscription model unless the xpacs are all $60 and eso plus gives you a shit ton of the dlc for the subscription, the lootboxes are scummy and pretty mobile and thats what stopped me from playing. but fallout 76 just doesn’t have enough content to warrant a subscription and saying “anyone who disagrees with me is a big baby” and that “you shouldnt have a problem with companies lying to you after you buy their products” are seriously bad takes
---
Intended? That's what I said. Are you really that dull? Just take the time you need to think it out, I'm sure you'll get there eventually.
---
I laughing *and* having fun playing the game !
---
Hurray !!

Careful there bud, your obvious truth will upset the people vehemently up in arms.
---
Wait, really? I bought the game for €15 in the Netherlands.
---
This happened to me as well and I couldn't eat or drink anything so I was slowly dying during the whole ordeal. My friend had to use his flamer to keep me from dying.
---
Griefing is the whole reason that many of us bought the Fallout 1st subscription. PVP in Fallout is a horrible idea and people have found a way around all of the safe guards for those of us that want nothing to do with it. If folks are mad at Bethesda they should take it out on Bethesda not those of us that just want to play the game without being shoot and having our camps destroyed.
---
Maybe if their atom store had stuff we wanted we would spend more on atoms.
---
But no, we have stupid stuff like teddy bears, beds with quilts that a 10 year old would be embarrassed of, mascot heads to make us look even more idiotic, emotes that don't even change the emote just slap a new icon above our head, 4 pickaxe skins, 4! Ever seen anyone over level 10 using a pickaxe?
---
They were on the right track adding handmade and 50.cal skins, but that came like 10 months into the games lifespan and it was limited time purchase!
---
Fallout 76 is not a noncompetitive game.
---
Sez who?  Where? Why?  What does "digital" mean?  Books?  Movies?  Music?
---
If you think you wanting to sue bethesda because you didnt get enough free stuff is somehow "relevant", I am not surprised you dont understand the difference between your and you're
---
In this instance we were referring to the more broad "slippery slope". I somehow actually forgot about the bag, so thank you though. Each time they do a scummy business decision they most likely sit back and watch the community. They judge the outrage and desensitization at that point to decide how to successfully push it a bit farther next time. False advertising, p2w, and overpricing are all part of the slippery slope as they can each feed into each other.
---
mayby those freeloaders should be called "server cpu resource thieves" instead?
---
And Bethesda supports you giving them your money for all eternity.
---
That's where my camp was. It was an open cave but now it is filled with Vines and some green vegitation.
---
You need to educate yourself on predatory practices then. The price, and content locked behind the membership are clear evidence of that. The game is BROKEN. Quest problems, event triggers, crashes, crashes on death and loosing any scrap, death barriers, the decrease of atoms earned freely, I mean come on lol! The list goes on! Do some research of your own. “Buyer Beware”, Jesus. Be a smart consumer and know when you are getting duped! I loved this game until around April, so I have a right to bash it, 380 hours man, over 7 or 8 months from launch.
---
If you enjoyed that's fair enough. For me i couldn't get past the boring story, repetitive mission structure, lack of rpg elements, below average shooting mechanics, dull grey world, and general bethesda jank
---
the whole game is still in beta though
---
How did this become about me lmao? So you are insinuating this is my website? You are making wild assumptions, including me wanting free stuff....say what, say huh!?!?? I simply shared info.
---
But since you're of the opinion that I ignored the question - I enjoy base-building, I enjoy helping out other players (the number of people who have either assumed the items free in my vending were listed as such accidentally or who have dropped high volume items either out of gratitude or guilt at paying nothing/almost nothing.  
---
I enjoy just exploring on whim, finding some scene or reference that I hadn't noticed over the past nearly year, or realizing something is just too perfectly lined up for either photomode or the in-character camera.
---
I'm medically unable to work, so particularly since player vending started I enjoy being able to run my little spot, happily irritated when someone cleans me out of things I try to keep plentiful as a service to the odd new or returning player, or helping start up a new alt if they don't have duplicate accounts or other players they trust to transfer possessions.
---
I'm often terrible at non pve combat, but my wife and I typically do a few rounds of NW on Friday and/or Saturday night when NW is most active, and it's becoming more common for both of us to be alive and shooting when the "final competitors remain" pops up, although it's usually shortly after that we're eliminated.  It's something to do together to break up the rhythm of other days.
---
Not working and living in the approximate region of 20 miles East of nowhere, it has usually been nice to interact with other people in real time, even if via a virtual setting.
---
I like to check off lists, I'm pretty pleased with 100% Trophy completion.  The pushback of Wastelanders is ever-so-slightly welcome because I'd like to finish my last Possum Scout badge before then.
---
Stellar argument. 👍🏼
---
I am happy for you. Not even joking. I don’t know why people are trying to make it look like the people who state obvious facts about the game are just “trying to run the experience for others”. This is the internet. I am allowed to share my thoughts. Right?
---
How about you shut up, you 'die-hard' posser? Go pet a wendigo.
---
Just kidding. But you certainly sound die-hard.
---
Kawaii her
---
Yeah I don’t expect fo5 until at least 2026
---
They have better weapon skins in Fallout 4 dlc that they could simply port over to this mess of a game, Google "Atoms Judgement", it's a supersledge with 4 leaking fusion cores on the front of it, do you think we got that? No, we got an ugly ass green Super mutant super sledge that I've yet to see being used by a player.
---
If any of you have ever wondered what a real life case of Stockholm Syndrome looks like, here it is.
---
I think the difference is that more people wanted a rougher pve experience than pvp. But they only created a mode that merged it together, which alienated people from it or forced them to take both. It's why people are so hyped up for raids and the burrows and every other new piece of pve content and then subsequently disappointed when it's broken and easy, or at least when the challenge comes from bad design rather than actually challenging mechanics
---
Thank you - that is a great answer
---
For saying people shouldn't be mean to eachother on the internet?
---
If you paid actual attention to the people angry about Fallout 1st, you'd see that the big issue isn't that it costs money, it's that it pay walls things that should be available to everyone regardless of their subscription status. 
---
Every time I talk about how I will gladly buy the subscription when they move the armor to the Atom Shop, the scrap box to the base game, and the forward tent behind a quest with skins for it in the Atom Shop, I get upvoted galore and replies from people agreeing with me. I don't even really have any use for private servers with the way my character is set up, but would gladly buy the subscription just for the monthly atoms. 
---
Considering how unstable the game is at times, yeah it's a bit of a slap in the face to then charge money for private servers that are actually stable, but there again, it's not the issue of the cost, it's the issue of the state of the game. Server stability shouldn't be behind a pay wall. Servers should be stable for everyone, regardless of subscription status.
---
But why genuinely listen to the people who have issues with Fallout 1st when you can instead scream at the top of your own lungs about how Zenimax can do no wrong, FO76 is a flawless game, and you'd eat literal shit in a wet bag if they fed it to you? I used to think working at Bethesda was a dream job of mine. Now I just feel sorry for them with what Zenimax is putting them through.
---
😂🤣😅
---
What makes the timing even worse is that there are probably a decent amount of people who decided that enough was enough, quit FO76, and used that $100 they just saved and went and purchased The Outer Worlds instead.
---
As if the game hasn't gotten enough insult over the whole "obsidian is making the fallout we want" deal, the timing just really feeds into that in the worst way possible.
---
Yes, now that I have calmed down and realized I don't really need anything that Fallout 1st offers, I am just waiting for some content, so that I would have a reason to play.
---
Because clearly I have the time to do so. Please, feel free to open Google, and look up every ftp mmo/mmorpg/multiplayer game that uses a cosmetic shop to fund it. You'll be busy reading for quite some time, as I usually am when I'm looking for something new to play. As for your second rate line, buddy, this game is second rate. Don't get me wrong, as much as I'm disappointed in Bethesda, I do enjoy the game, but in the long line of online, multiplayer games that I have played, this is one of the buggiest, unstable games I've played that has had the gall to even think about charging me for something. In a year very little content has been added, the bugs have shuffled around, but never truly been fixed, they've gone back on several promises, and had several legal cases open for fraudulent promotions for the game. If this game was run by any other company, it would have been buried, and forgotten by now because of all the issues, but Bethesda had earned an extremely loyal audience due to the heart, and soul they used to put into games. They loyalty is wearing thin these days though.
---
I just don't want to see my fellow gamers ripped off and support a greedy lying company.
---
There is actually a reply similar to your's, what I said is that I would like to see it by year 3,4, or 5 That's more than enough time to flush out the Wastelanders.
---
Have not been on in a long time but no survival mean I probably just wont be back at all
---
I mean, I don't doubt that it's happening somewhere to some people, but all I'm saying is I spent 600+ hours playing by myself and only got griefed about 4 times total. Even with the pride flag player icon, nobody ever targeted me for anything even when I took workshops or went to public events
---
While i can understand your point if you are new to Fallout and see this as a game feature, i really don't agree. Stash limitations have not existed in the last 3 fallout games. It s certainly not a feature for me. Before launch, Pete Hines also told that there is no limit as he knows. I believed, that Bethesda was to incompetent to programm that into Multiplayer, but know we learned that this is not the case. Further i don't like to play InventoryManager 76 where i need to be carefull what i can collect with this very limited Stash Limit. I don't like such things, it is not Fallout for me and if i want that kind of Inventory Managment i buy another game...
---
How do you assume that when YOU dont even know they released a Patriot/Liberty Prime power armor skin in the atom shop? You are are the real problem in every situation, an idiot talking out their ass.
---
Are you the key master?
---
Not really lol
---
Yeah, I don't mind them adding a subscription service. Just without any gameplay affecting stuff. They should have kept it strictly cosmetic. Except for servers, I understand why they'd want money for servers, but I'm pretty sure people in general wanted dedicated servers for modding, now what we've got now.
---
hate sells
---
Why do you expect upcoming content to be free? Why are so many people feeling entitled to expect free content? You should pay for the upcoming premium content such as wastelanders. They should charge you 19.99 for it!
---
Why should have to pay for a private sever when they said it would comes as free content. Let be honest the reason why the are charging for it because this way they can monetize mods. Here the other thing we do not even know whether or not if 76 going allow us to use mods from nexus. Instead of them putting their resources into making the wastelanders dlc come out on schedule they hobble together a subscription model while still charging full price for the game. I was going to pick the game up since was on sale for 23 bucks but then I stopped because I realized they have change the game for better they are trying make money from this sinking ship.
---
Aren't they?  I work in an independent pharmacy. I came from a big chain.  The chain could EASILY put us out of business, IF they would staff the store properly!  They refuse to.  They think it's perfectly fine for one pharmacist and a tech if she's lucky to handle input, adjudication, counting, verification, and 2 registers, 2 lanes of drive thru and 10 phone lines.  It's insane, but as long as their customers keep getting pissed off and coming to us (where the time to answer the phone is measured in seconds, not minutes), works for me.
---
TLDR:  NEVER underestimate how stupid companies can be, some literally operate on the "why make billions when we could make millions" principle .
---
The Ammo Factory doesn’t generate that fast. It has a rate of 83/hour.   You won’t be doubled up.
---
Thats not how it works. When you create something under contract for a company to be used in a project- such as a video game or film- then the company owns the design. Do you think the guys who created the lightsaber sound effect get a paycheck every time something star wars related comes out?
---
i would, great idea. Unfortunately i already deleted the game.
---
Goodluck finding anybody, when the only people left are the 1st subscribers and everbody is playing solo on empty worlds.
---
$5 a month was never going to happen, you're in faerie land on that part. :-p
---
$9.99 USD / £7.99 GBP / $12.99 CAD would have been far more appropriate, both in context of other games and 76's own lifeline. 
---
I agree with everything else though. The game was slowly turning around, major publications were posting neutral and even positive articles about the game, and even the r/fallout sub was becoming more accepting. Then Bethesda decides to shit the bed in spectacular fashion by ending the Nuclear Winter phase with a limp (crappy display cases, delayed Legendary progression, failed vault raid), allow a content and communication drought to exist for the next 2-3 months, and then-- with possibly the world's most blunt force PR move-- release a statement defending microtransactions, delaying Wastelanders, and teasing private servers with no details.
---
So what happens? All the negativity of the MTX stuff and Wastelander's delay was allowed to fester for a full 6 days, leading into a major update (patch 14) which wasn't really \*that\* major in the first place and quickly became overshadowed by this company, after the last 5-6 months of MEH, asking its player base to pay a monthly sub for non-persistent servers that felt like paying for stability in a non-MMO game. 
---
Yes, this was one of the greatest decision making fails I've seen from a major games company.
---
Yup they never said anything about the many many things that they did good with 76 and just hate
---
Well i didn't even think of that. Good tip. My alts could use a few more weight perks but i also don't really need them as mules now either.
---
Except the bug where others could join. I'm telling you, if you want scrap and have unlimited storage you'll have more than you need with minimal time investment and no need for workshops. I can count on my hands how many times someone took a workshop I held in one year, no joke
---
THANK YOU The people making the amazing and texturing items are not to blame. Also remember that Studio Austin just started and they were given one of their biggest projects. With all the deadlines and pressure they get from the higher ups,
---
C u t  A u s t i n  s o m e  s l a c k .
---
Absolutely true. Fully modded, cheap, silenced. A great weapon.
---
For the low, low price of $40 a month you can explore a slightly updated version of Fallout 3's map!
---
I know you can lure enemies over, or exploit reactive plates/the two damage mutations, or blow up cars/etc, but that kind of stuff is generally pretty obvious when somebody is trying to set it up. It's not like they can just snipe you with a gauss rifle while you're in pacifist, you will see them coming up to you and trying to mess with you first to trigger some exploit
---
Oh, they can do it, they just have to be sly about it. I had a low-level 13 grab a workshop by me, no big deal right? He starts a "defend the workshop" event but comes over to MY camp after "aggro'ing the mobs... Which shows a little too much savvy for a lvl13!  I let it stand because I had a feeling I'd be dealing with his Hi-lvl Alt. in the future...
---
Try shooting without pacifist mode. If they don’t have it off, nuke them repeatedly.
---
And your paying the company money so other players don't take your stuff... Sound like a shit game
---
I find the fridge not all that useful.  The scrap collector game breaking either.  He gathers very slowly.  I can get hundreds of pounds of scrap in the same time he finds 10 items.  People love to complain, and envy is just an ugly thing.
---
"They're just jealous poor people." He said as him and his entire family was dragged to the town centre and decapitated.
---
I have soloed the queen and still it does not complete...
---
Ok, they're hypocrites sure. What's your point? Bethesda is still money greedy and I guess the YouTubers are too. Nothing here to say
---
I use a full set of Unyielding. It did take a while to find, but definitely worth the wait.
---
Nice straw-man argument you have there. Funny how someone who named themselves after rick and morty is this bad at understanding people's arguments enough to refute them.
---
do people still run those? regardless, it's pretty obvious what somebody is trying to do if they start running up to you and throwing mines around you. literally all you have to do is keep walking in one direction and they won't be able to do anything. or fast travel away. or leave the server
---
They Arent This Is Litreally The Same Subscription Every Ohter Mmo Has Even With The Addition Of Private Servers
---
Boy, it's like they want to get the information out there. Not like YouTube demonizes nearly any video that has any "trigger words" these days, or is considered to be controversial in any way. Trust me, as an ex YouTuber, they aren't making jack shit on the videos, they are just weighing in in the topic, and proliferating the information.
---
Not yet
---
Well they paid to be a target to be honest lol while i don't like grief on anyone i have no sympathy for people that support this kind of BS either, you can also thank Bughtesda for that they put their own already small community against each other Bugthesda greed turned into toxic poison.
---
Yeah if you have pacifist mode on other plahers cant touch you outaide of workshops. You also cant damage anyone else either though. Pretty mych the onoy way to become wanted against someone who has pacifist on is to pick something they have that's locked.
---
not yet
---
It was most likely going to release with wastelanders but it was delayed, they were too pressured to release the membership service by the big heads at Zenimax and there investors. I personally think they were pushed into a corner and either release a broken dlc or the membership service they thought that the membership service might not cause as much of a shit storm that it has become.
---
Yes. Actually, I'm a friend of his, he told me to meet him here.
---
That is good. Bear in mind multipliers are the real deal. My commando uses a.38 Fixer Which says 78 on Pipboy but hits for 200-500.
---
Most of the player base is actually really friendly and good people...but here lately it’s just a bunch of people bitching about a game that is taken way too seriously. If you don’t want to pay, don’t...the game is still there. NOTHING HAS CHANGED FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DONT WANT TO PAY. But every few minutes there are still karma whores like yourself that want to make posts and get people wound up over OPTIONAL PURCHASES for a VIDEO GAME. “I’ve been here since beta, I deserve better!” and “But Pete said this, so let’s sue Bethesda!”...that shit is getting old. Buy it or don’t, but move the fuck on.
---
But hey, if you all want to downvote me that’s cool. I’d rather have you at my camp buying ammo I crafted from my unlimited budget scrap box than your upvotes anyway.
---
I plan on purchasing it on Thursday when I get paid
---
I use it too but all I find from vendors and off legendaries is 1 star i managed to get 3 3 stars but nothing very amazing
---
And you sound like a trashcan of a human being so why aren't you on a street corner collecting actual shit?
---
I had so much problems in this subreddit with fanboys without a brain taking over the community. I got better respons by posting in r/gaming seriously. It's same with Borderlands 3. Their subreddit is all about fanboys and roleplayers and cheaters that are ok with exploiting, glitching and cheat engine. And don't you DARE say against that.
---
I'm tired of SINGLE PLAYER PVE GAMES having a large AF community, and yet it doesn't count towards the multiplayer online rules.  There is a page selling weapons for 10 dollar, and the weapons are the one you don't even pick up once you played a bit end game. It's a fucking scam. Either they scam people who have no clue, or they mod weapons and run around like god tier players IN 4 MAN GROUP CONTENT. And when I see this that they run around like this without getting banned, why in the name of fuck would I spend 350 hours farming a god tier weapon as rng, when a modded cheat weapon is better and it doesn't need to be farmed even.
---
&gt; \-Logical, reasonable people 
---
No-one in their right mind will tell you to spend your money if you don't want to. But the idea other people can't have fun, enjoy, or willingly pay for Fallout 1st  without being a "reasonable" person is just despicable.   
---
For the record, I haven't payed for Fallout 1st, but I wouldn't be such a dick to people who have. It just feels distasteful.
---
Your right the fridge is almost useless, I personally got it cause of wanting to build an all out kitchen in my camp. The scrap collector again your right it's incredibly slow, my mineral extractor does it faster. I'm still reading some of the threads about the new updates and Jesus some people just want to set the game on fire lol
---
Eh, if it was publicly traded, they'd still have to at least *try* to provide good profits, but it's not like stockholders can directly tell them to screw over an entire franchise just for a stock bump.
---
If your grasp on economics leads you to buy a subscription for a game that is still in need of bug fixes that have been in game since day 1, you might want to research slightly more complex economics. My understanding of economics is that this company is not delivering a good product, so I will not give this company any more money until I see some drastic changes in how they do business. Laugh at that all you want man.
---
Mine is a mix of 2 and 3*, I've slowly been upgrading the 2* to 3* when I run across them. But now that you brought it up it has been a little while since I've upgraded a piece.
---
It was literally said that you would never be able to do this and that it would only be hosted by them.  So for 14 months this has been a known fact.  14 months...over a year, you can find posts on reddit about it the info was not hidden.    
---
This is not up for debate over a year they said there will never be local private hosting, so I do not get where people ever thought it would happen or even had a wishful thinking for it.
---
So you don't remember how great some of the weapons you got in FO:NV DLC were?  I was using the BAR from dead money all over the main game, definitely, from my point of view, gave me an advantage over people who didn't buy the DLC.
---
What a shill.
---
I dont need to assume, you're too stupid to understand the difference between your and you're
---
No, they won't. And stop conflating arguments made specifically for something else to boost the "veracity" of your argument.
---
No one is selling because they all want a set as well 🙃
---
Shouldn't be dropping nukes then. Although that's more the fault of Zenimax than Bethesda's community managers.
---
Exactly it feel oddly like the pieces drop rates are nerfed. At this point I take any unyeilding piece I see regardless of the affect cause I cant find any with ones that I actually want
---
Anything from Gun Runner's arsenal in Fallout New Vegas especially the Garand, M16, and the 12.7mm smg. Also the 9mm Mauser, Pancor Jackhammer, Grease Gun, Desert Eagle from Fallout 2. There really needs to be a "gun runners arsenal" type of dlc when Wastelanders comes out. The weaponry needs expanding.
---
Ummm, wait, maybe because they said so? Are you a troll or just someone who want's to fight with everyone?
---
Now with Straw man fallacy. You're just full of fallacies, aren't you.
---
Fans are begging for 5 star legendaries to be pay to win atom shop items.
---
Probably yes that and vanguard
---
Except there are explicit disadvantages if you don’t pay.
---
When is it delayed to? And when was it supposed to be released?
---
Unyielding is probably the most popular set out there. You probably don't see it often in vendors because the people are using or saving them. Powered unyielding sentinel is the most expensive piece out there next to assassins with same rolls.
---
Bethesda stopped calliing the shots when they took hundreds of millions of dollars in private equity from one investor.  Providence Equity Partners, look it up.
---
&gt; 'm an accountant, it is my job to know that,
---
My commiserations.  Didn't mean to undercut you, just give some support.
---
Lmao nice jab at bethesda. Wont lie though I wont be surprised if legendary players will the 5th star lol
---
Does Bethesda call them private servers? 
---
They don't.
---
 You know why?
---
Because they are not private servers.
---
They were talking about legendaries in the cash shop bring a convenience? Because that's *your* argument.  You can't even make an argument of what is, so you slippery slope and setup a straw man attack.
---
I know, but the person I was responding to specifically mentioned crafting antibiotics as a way to avoid farming for disease cure ingredients. Pharma Farms will absolutely give you enough antibiotics to keep you from ever having to craft disease cures, but crafting antibiotics won't.
---
You have a good point and I'm glad you brought it to my attention. Wonder why they would nerf the drop rate of armor? If they really did. Maybe everyone is using it, I see a lot more people who are using a Bloodied build now than I use to also.
---
You’re thinking of toilets. Toilets collect shit. Maybe finish high school and then rejoin this ‘convo’.
---
I can see that but is it just any or a specific combo
---
Yes, I agree to 100%. 
---
Especially the private servers cost money.
---
And because all DLCs will continue to appear **free for all players**.
---
EDIT: I too will continue to support Bethesda. Most of my favorite games are published or developed by Bethesda, including Fallout 76.
---
I'm not saying to attack the 1st players, but I do think it's interesting that pumpkin grenades, and nuke mines can kill a passive player with radiation without them attacking you back. Would be a shame if someone with a love of pking people, and a dislike of what Bethesda has pulled, started to microwave anyone that supported that shit.... You shouldn't do that, but if you did, that would be a shame, taking advantage of some friendly information I put out there with the intention of just informing folks of a bug...
---
But you never explained how the subscription service is pay to win. I'm being serious about that too. 
---
Me or the next guy having Fallout 1st gives no competitive advantage over one another during an engagement. Which is the only way p2w would apply to this game. 
---
I've made thousands of rounds of ammo,farmed resources, farmed legendaries for scrip to acquire the best weapons from the purveyor and to trade amongst the community and I did all of that before fallout 1st came along. All of that can still be done without Fallout 1st. It also still does not create a p2w situation. Yes the tent is convenient but it's only that and doesnt create an competitive advantage over another player. With that being said, shouldn't someone actively looking for pvp be totally prepared? Have only their best armor and weapons, aid need for pvp (atoms, berry mentors, stealth boy, etc) and free of junk as to not get overencumbered so they can retreat if need be. On the flip side, someone not looking for pvp should have pacifist mode turned on! That is very important. They should also avoid workshops. So see, two perfectly good examples how to side step one of two situations. 
---
People like to throw terms around and base them loosely on their perception of it. Now with that being said, maybe the OP feels it does create a p2w situation. But by definition, it does not. He is entitled  to his opinion and feelings towards it.
---
Exactly even now some still are drinking the Bugthesda Kool-Aid there is no hope for these very "S.P.E.C.I.A.L." kind of people they are living in their own bubble.
---
But the positive side has plenty of trolls too. Like I said, it hasn't just been one-sided. Those who have been defending the game have been equally guilty of trolling and circlejerking. So I don't buy your argument. The reason why there are more negative reviews is simply because there are more people who have a negative opinion about the game than a positive one. The game bombed. It happens. It's not the first game to do so, and it won't be the last. I think it's unfair to call everyone who gave the game a negative review a "troll". What about the professional reviewers? Sure, they gave it a slightly higher score, but still not a good one. 52/100 is pretty poor. So are they trolls too?
---
Fine with me, I've know the workarounds for killing players outside of pvp zones for a while now I've just only done it to the biggest assholes.  Fo76 class war my dudes :)
---
The Autoaxe! But we'll never see that in 76.... :c
---
All within the rules of course, which is why I love bethesda games.  Legal exploits 😎
---
Says the person who went with "you live at your parents house" as an insult. Who's in high school? Lol you're making this too easy
---
Cool idea. I would join you, but i already deleted the game.
---
That may be true but Appa and Lloyd were very clearly just talking about the P2W part.
---
Yeah, no. Nothing in Fallout's past predicted how bad 76 ended up being. Sure, I knew it would be buggy, and I accepted that. Sure, I knew the cash shop would have a lot of overpriced tat. But as someone who *didn't* hate Fallout 4 (yes, including the base game), I wasn't expecting 76 to be so bereft of engaging content. I just couldn't conceive that Bethesda would turn their backs on the RPG inheritance of Fallout so completely as they ended up doing, and that they legitimately expected player interactions to fill the gap. 
---
The game is a massive disappointment from any vantage point other than blind Bethesda fanboy devotion: no 'false info, YouTuber lies, or things taken out of context' required. It was a terrible game at launch, has been terribly mishandled post-launch, and remains a bad game today, and it has thoroughly earned both its reception and reputation. Stop apologising for Bethesda, and instead demand that they do better and actually produce a game worth people's money and time.
---
Scrap N Cap - Thumbs Up To THIS POST!
---
Pretty much spot on.
---
Less S more P
---
Because they can't afford more servers, and the public sessions are practically private servers anyway because no one even plays the game 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
Cool, i had to manually delete it from 3 machines. That would have been very convenient.
---
I might buy fo1st if there more content in the game. But honest, not now.
---
&gt;I don't have any actual rebuttal so I'll just say you're bandwagoning even though there are tons of legitimate criticisms of this game
---
Let me guess, SaLtY yOuTuBeR next right?
---
If this somehow, and please understand I’m saying somehow, ends with Bethesda giving refunds for the Fallout 1st subscription or just straight up canceling it, I just don’t know man, is that enough to get us back to where we were all standing last week? I hope that this comes true or something similar at least, but I can see more backlash happening because it just proves that they really are creating problems and selling solutions (yes, I know that IS what they’re doing, but that’s just solid proof)
---
What is this referencing? Have bethesda said they will add 5 star legendary items to the store to pay for with real money?
---
Just curious, why has 1st made this easier? I'm a fan, just not sure I understand.
---
Anyone who thinks free to play is awsome go play Skyforge its free... O wait ya its free to play yet it costs 15,00 month subscription. + 60.00 to buy a new toon.
---
Mayor for a day
---
at this point, if anyone buys this shit they deserve to get fucked with bullshit exchange rates. a fool and his money are soon parted.
---
Also for anyone that reads this, I wont be giving out my xbox ign but if you see a bloodied dude that owns all the workshops in a server and has a tendency to hang around the fallout 1st cool cats, send me a message and we can enjoy this update together 😎
---
Yeah, it's downright game breaking. It literally breaks multiple core mechanics of their game. How it made it past QA, I'll never know.
---
Exactly it is to be just melee players who used it now everyone does. I've even started to adjust mine to be different lol but maybe they would just cause nerfing it would just make it useless
---
The mistress of mystery questline was my favourite :)
---
But outer worlds and 76 are not similar games at all.
---
Their audiences wouldn't even overlap.
---
How are you going to kill them in their private world? There is no war.
---
If it bleeds it leads.
---
Again, read the rest of the post. Not just the first sentence. Nobody was talking about DLC. Also, New Vegas is not a multiplayer game.
---
It is a pretty bland game.
---
I actually just picked it up in game yesterday. Saw it in the chest, turned the sound WAY down, and THEN picked it up. She's so shouty, and she likes heights and bright lights.
---
when companies pull this shit i just pirate their game :)  if they try and scam, i just don't buy that shit. [the australia tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Tax) is fucking bullshit and i'm so sick of it
---
My understanding is that if a business model is making plenty of profit then there is no real reason to change it and that the production of more content requires more funds and cannot be provided for free indefinitely. I'm not laughing anymore as much as I'm just dumbfounded that people dont understand.
---
That's not what the outrage is about, if they separated the servers from all the other bullshit and made it its own $1 or $2 per month subscription, very few people would care compared to what we have now. It's the fact that they are charging so much and slapping pay to win features alongside it as well as atoms and the outfit, which makes it *technically* a good deal for people who already buy atoms but still really scummy for the people who don't
---
Imo best option would have been to keep the ranger outfit and atoms as a bonus promotion bundle, private servers as a cheap separate subscription, and the scrapbox/tent either as an in-game reward for a short questline or just thrown in the atom shop like the fridge and scrap collector
---
&gt; Holy shit you idiot
---
This is always a good way to progress a conversation in a respectful way and will never cause the recipient to completely shut down
---
This is what happens when Devs don't player their own game/
---
My rebuttal  to "Nuh Uh, my friend stopped playing" is my friends haven't sropped playing. Equal and opposite reaction I guess
---
PoE does things quite well.
---
Your...or shall I say it this way for you... you're dumbass makes assumptions about me wanting free stuff...guess we are even eh? I dont need anyones free stuff, im well off, hopefully you can say the same.
---

low effort circlejerk shit.
---
Honestly this sub is becoming worse than /r/gaming
---
DAE EA BAD? UPVOTE NOW!
---
They seem pretty good at expanding outrage.
---
Are you saying they are wrong?
---
Who downvoted me and why?
---
&gt; you'd see that the big issue isn't that it costs money, it's that it pay walls things that should be available to everyone regardless of their subscription status. 
---
Should?  According to who?
---
Had the game installed since beta and it hasn't deleted itself once.
---
Sounds like something on your end.
---
Some folks are really bending over backwards to narrow the concept of pay to win in order to make it seem like Bethesda hasn't actually done this.
---
Sorry, but developers that care about the community is another $12 a month charge.
---
Your right, I've actually been trying to get another compete set together. But instead of Unyielding I'm going Bolstering Marine this time. So far I've got 3 of the 5 pieces I need. And it's been kinda rough finding the left arm and left leg for it also.
---
Calling out low effort circlejerking != not being able to "handle" the game being criticised.
---
This post isn't even criticism. What are you even talking about...
---
It isn't?  Where's the scoreboard?  Have I won yet?
---

I really like how the marine armor looks by its self.

* **X-01 Power Armor - level 50**
---
You are stupid so it does not matter what you think. I will help you out and not use any more contractions so that maybe you will understand. Better?
---
I showed them there is a demand.  Well, yeeeeah.  I find things to enjoy about the game.  The rest of you can sit around and complain and harass people who support the game financially if you want.  Never mind how stupid it is to attack the people investing in the game so you people who want everything free can get it "free".  Seems like the vast majority of gamers these days are just entitled cry babies.
---
Mark my words: 3-6 months from now this sub will try to convince you that they are quitting and uninstalling this game ‘for good’.
---
I've been a Bloodied melee build from the beginning and recently have thought about switching over to heavy guns. But don't know if it's worth it or not. Have you ever changed your whole build? Just curious in your opinion
---
the only slippery slope fallacy is the one where you pretend that slippery slopes don't exist. i never thought that people could be so dense until i saw people trying to claim that it was a fallacy here.
---
By your logic here why would you ever watch or read a prequel, and by extension play or watch or read the original? In the later installments you know it works out
---
"They"
---
Which youtubers are you referring to? I know plenty of youtubers who have been praising the game.
---
You are stupid, so I feel the same way, probably in your moms basement as we speak, if not, prove me wrong.
---
By the sound of it when you said Bloodied FFR Handmade what you really meant to say was a real money purchased duped Junkie's Explosive Laser and you also forgot to mention your real money purchased duped Assasin Sentinel Marine Armor set.  In fact me thinks youre just salty that people no longer are forced to contend with your actual Pay2Win glitched legacy god roll bullshit.
---
A game that has PvP isn't "noncompetitive". Don't be ridiculous.
---
Oooh I found the salt to my chips guys.
---
I lucked out and found a lvl 2 coming out straight from the vault. First time he went down, I revived him and it counted. Then I gave him some stimpacks and purified water.
---
&gt; Nobody was talking about DLC
---
Paid content that gives an advantage?
---
&gt; New Vegas is not a multiplayer game.
---
So what?  FO76 is not a competitive game.
---
You're complaining that FO76 includes paid content that lets you play in a different way.  I'm pointing out that FO:NV included paid content that let you play in a different way.  The outrage is hypocrisy.
---
Sure. Except it's not like Bethesda grasps the concept that letting us *pick* the server we'd be joining would make things a little less annoying. Which means even if you befriend a "less social" gamer, you still could end up hopping into a nearly full server. I mean, I typically play only with my SO, but I'm frequently put on busy servers because of how Bethesda has the server selection system set up. It's not like there's a bit of code that goes "oh! You don't play with others much, so let's put you in an almost empty server!".
---
If BGS had 2 working brain cells in the group, they'd be protecting their IP and not turning it into a cash grab - if they were in control.
---
They're not in control.
---
I'm also seeing a ton of low ranked players on PC.
---
Try playing the game.
---
I found the idiot too.

If the world building and interactions don't do it for you try bringing two companions with you.

Not only will you build relationships with them as the slowly open up to you, but they will also converse with each other.
---
For me fo76 offers a bit of everything I enjoy about fallout (except for a lack of story) and I can play it with my gf and brother.
---
No game offers the same experience and like other live service product can get better with time(eso/destiny/gta/etc) or fail. 
---
I mean yeah 13 dollars a month for a game thats alittle dry on content is little meh but I spend that just going to see the joker for 2 hours. And I play fo76 quite a bit.
---
You're missing the point that I'm not trying to be respectful to you.
---
what about games like minecraft, space engineers, I'd also guess ark, rust maybe even no man's sky. A multiplayer fallout, while a new idea, isn't really pushing any limits, other than the outdated engine it was made in (I mean for God's sake they used the frame count to calculate physics lmao).
---
Thank you! I was wondering how everyone's p*ssd with the high price while I'm sitting here, wondering how the heck $99 translate to 120€.
---
It's friggin 50% more. 
---
I uninstalled the game, by the way. But still, I found no official information about this. Anyone got word from Cashthesda?
---
while things are expensive here, people who bought this game deserve what they get. there were countless people warning everyone away from this game, even just for a week or so until you can actually see if it's good or not, but no, gotta pre order and suck that bethesda shaft. oh what? the game sucks? wow i can't believe it.
---
I know. I'm okay with the cost,  Ranger outfit and  the 1650 atoms. The scrapbox, the increased budget, and second FT are definitely paid features. Things that people in this sub have been asking for since day 1. Specifically the stash and budget. Then they give it to us at a price. They needed something to hook the players into buying the subscription, but that wasn't the right way. At the very least the scap box should have been in the atom shop.
---
&gt;in order to milk those few left playing it, but the fact that so many are bending over 
---
Which is it, so few or so many? I mean, you contradict yourself before the next breath. Lmao
---
You think a cool costume gives you a competitive advantage in PvP?
---
One of the few games that I've played on a regular basis over the last few years is DDO and they started the freemium model that FO76 is using. You can subscribe for points and some conveniences, pay for account and character upgrades, or grind out points for rewards in game. People have been screaming doom for at least 5 years, but they still exist, and regularly release new content.
---
But... but... what are the people on this sub going to whine about if they can’t make false claims about the private servers?
---
What you have is a game developer that's sold out and isn't in control of the decisions any more.  The investors are demanding a different business model that's worth more, so they can make money selling off their interests.
---
Atoms are not real money folks!
---
Do you hear me? ATOMS ARE NOT REAL MONEY.
---
Wow. You can not even use commas correctly. My 5 year old niece has a better understanding of the English language than you do. How does that make you feel?
---
EA BAD?????
---
To be honest the tent doesn't bother me. I intentionally built my C.A.M.P. as a mobile one. I only used the necessary equipment (sleeping bag, some work benches, stash) and drop in areas I know I'll be stationed for a while. If you want to build a mansion that's perfectly fine. Next time roll a new character build smaller.
---
Nope.
---
Get a private server, turn off pacifist mode, and make your own battle royale/pvp.
---
Hell if I care - I’m balls deep in The Outer Limits now and won’t be back.
---
not as much as you seem to think, a pound is still worth more than a US dollar.
---
Yes, Bethesda is a very small indie company that spent all their money to pit out a perfect, bug frer, polished, stellar game with thousands of hours of content so good that fans are clamoring for more, but alas! Besthesda has no money, because they started just last year in a garage. And now we must give them all our money because the three deficated people eho worked on game tirelessly to provide a perfect game at indie prices are starving after the massive sales and rave reviews!
---
yeah but you could get LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE, LIGHT WOOD LAMINATE!
---
Its about time we ditched the Pay to Win and called it Pay for Advantage because idiots or shills will take the "Win" part as literal and use it as a excuse to defend the incovenience they introduce in this broken game.
---
They need to fire whoever came up with this
---
How many different ways can you say "ugh".
---
😂 Chill man. Its just funny how people get soo wroked up about the game. I havnt buyed fallout 1st because it costs way too much for what your getting. Bethesda wont listen to us at all with this feedback so I reccomend people to bother with the problem. But you know I understand, this is a great way to karma farm.
---
You can find the answer to your question by doing a google search for ‘How many AAA video game have some form of monetization’.
---
&gt; for the rest of this games short life. Let the 100 people pay and pay until Bethesda says “whoops still not profitable” and shuts down the servers
---
So your enjoyment comes from other people not having enjoyment.  Got it. You might want to stop and think about what that says about you...
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Tax this is what he was referencing in case you wanted to read more about it.
---
Like the low effort "when you leave, please drop me your stuff" I never see you Fallout 1st defenders calling out? 
---
The person I replied to is also the same person who, on another post, equated the amount of people in this subreddit who are against Fallout 1st, but don't even play the game, to being on the same level as Russian election meddling, while also heavily implying that everyone who's against the subscription service doesn't play the game. Something that could not be any farther from the truth if they tried. 
---
For every one person posting about how stupid Fallout 1st is without playing the game, there's multiple others who do play the game and are against Fallout 1st. 
---
They also sure as shit aren't going to call out anyone who posts in this subreddit about how Fallout 1st is just fine and dandy, even though that person never played the game. Because even though that person never played the game, they have the same opinion as the person I replied to. 
---
So, no, they can't handle the game being criticised.
---
Second rate is too much praise for this game. This game is third class.
---
&gt; Where as creators were pissed that the community didnt think they deserved anything
---
Not true at all. Many mod creators were pissed about the whole thing, especially since a lot (probably most, especially of the bigger/more popular mods) of mods incorporate other (free) mods. It's a whole ecosystem, and super disingenuous to push the narrative of entitled players vs creators.
---
Just finished my collection of marine weapon weight gear. Took forever.
---
Nope. Never said or even implied.
---
Dafaq you commenting here for then you cretin?
---
Sadly this sounds possible
---
Point #3 on the main post. Wow you already proved his point.
---
Convenience is an advantage. If i have a gun with unlimited ammo and my opponent has the same gun but with limited ammo, im at an advantage. Which can happen by buying a scrap bot, unlimited scrap space and AFKing.
---
Brah that's your PS4 screaming out for mercy. Your console hasn't aged well and is having problem running games most others have no problem with
---
Why would Bethesda Game Studios willingly blow its own reputation to artificially inflate the reputation of competitor company Obsidian Entertainment which already enjoys a vastly better reputation over BGS among Fallout fans because of their work in the Fallout franchise itself?
---
no 100 a year is a lot of money for a broken service on a broken game   
---
100 a year to have like 200 games on game pass seems alright , see what i mean
---
Reminds me of a beaten and affection starved dog.
---
Are you kidding? They wouldn't overlap? Fallout fans are fans of single player RPGs and outer worlds is a single player rpg literally made by the people who made fallout.
---
They overlap so much they are nearly the same cirlce.
---
Just funny
---
How is this not a simple fix?  Just do it.
---
Well, it seemed like you had some kind of statistic with successful AAA games which did or didn't have some of these.
---
Trying? They aren’t trying friend, look around. They’re here.
---
I feel great, doing well in life, how about you? Like my commas?
---
Fantastic
---
It doesn't give you advantage because you are not playing against other players. You can stop trolling now.
---
Do they tell you to please not spoil too much?
---
We are talking the same company that offered paid dlc horse armor before it was really a thing.
---
The company that milked one game dry for like 10 years and through different platforms. And offered paid mods in f04
---
Like the writing been on the wall for awhile. Could they be better sure, But doesn't stop me from enjoying the games for what they are.
---
Garbage game
---
Very well put, very informative thank you for this!
---
 You made the statement back it up. 
---
 The game runs very well for me and I have no complaints right now as to the game. On my 32" 4k screen I cannot get much below 55 FPS and its smooth and fast. I have not been disconnected in a very long time.
---
 I suspect many of you have substandard equipment. You need an Xbox One X to even play at 4k and that's going to be less than ideal. I dunno what the PS4 people are doing, but again weak machines.
---
I think we'll get the prestige system and legendary mods at the same time. The prestige perks will make you op and the legendary mods will help balance? I'm guessing well see weapon weight perks and fire ,ice and electrical mods.
---
Gyuck gyuck
---
Appreciate the offer, but I finally scrapped the prerequisite 300 tons yesterday. The horror was still fresh in my head when this discussion popped up.
---
I guess you weren't around in the 90s. Ever heard of Multi User Dungeons?
---
no man's sky? rainbow six siege? Minecraft? For honor? there's probably a ton more I'm forgetting but it's entirely possible to update a game without adding subscriptions
---
It isnt on rails just because it's split into discrete zones instead of a sandbox lol
---
You can even do that with games like Minecraft.
---
Lol the pizza thing is not relevant by your own admission, you said that one person calling the pizza company could resolve your gripe and with a game company this could not work.
---
Lmao your idea of doing research is to read and listen to the biased opinions of others online? I’m sorry but that’s just moronic. I prefer to experience things myself and then make a decision on whether I like it or not and I can guarantee you lag is not gone from the vault raids on private servers. I tried the vault raids on a friends private server and although it wasn’t the worst lag I’ve ever experienced it was definitely not the best. Perhaps you’re fighting the wrong battle maybe you should focus your attentions on campaigning for better performance from the instanced vaults. After all that’s the main thing ruining your experience and it’s certainly not as a result of the implementation of the subscription service. 
---
Also you make the point in your initial comment of what would happen if nobody paid. Well I can tell you now that new content would stop and eventually the FO76 servers would shut down. Why would a company spend time and money creating new content if they weren’t going to make money off it? 
---
Like it or not your game costs money to make and the funny thing is they’re not even forcing you to pay for new game play so you don’t have to if you don’t want to. So why are you so angry? Cuz they won’t give you free private servers? Get over it, servers cost money to host, even roblox charge you for private servers lol
---
Call it a cash grab if you like, but nobody would expect you to work for free so why would you expect Bethesda?
---
Lol fair, forgot about that whole thing.
---
And how would I make a Fallout 76 DLC? I don't work for Bethesda.
---
Same gunplay as fallout 4/76 or borderlands with the writing quality of NV
---
Miss the idea, but they never quite ironed it out. The damage caps at the end we're just dumb. Still need to bring back some sort of PvP area or arena, not hunter hunted.
---
Imagine comparing a video game company too a terrorist organisation 😂
---
Upvoted.
---
Also the company that's been releasing broken games for a while but people accepted it because "it's part of the charm" and Modders fix it anyways
---
It depends.
---
In the US, generally, a business only has to collect a sales tax if the business has a physical presence in that jurisdiction. The internet has made that significant.
---
Amazon has become a great example of this. In any state where they have a warehouse or distribution center to shorten shipping times, they have a physical presence and must calculate and collect the sales taxes for any item being shipped to a customer in that state, even if the item is coming from a different state.
---
To further complicate it, we have 50 states all with taxing authority then about another 3000 counties which may or may not have their own sales tax and then any cities with their own sales taxes. And of course they all can make their own exemptions (or not) of any items like food or school supplies or time periods for a temporary exemption.
---
Your 2nd question "pay the taxes later?" is a yes we're supposed to. But many people just evade the tax and never report it. And the government doesn't come for the taxes because usually it would cost more for enforcement than it would recover. Most states have a 4-7.5% sales tax, counties 0-2%, and cities 0-2% for a total of 0-10%. And it's not that unusual for businesses just feet away from each other to have drastically different taxes if they are on a border.
---
Our taxes vary greatly from place to place and type. It's why people dock their multi million dollar yachts in iirc Rhode Island and residents of Memphis, Tennessee cross the state line to buy their vehicles in Arkansas. Or why you'd want to file your LLC for a lemonade stand in Delaware or register your freight company's trailers in just a few states where it saves a lot of money.
---
(This is the same globally where countries encourage companies to headquarter their businesses there by having lower taxes.)
---
In any case, it's unreasonable to require every online business to know the current and ever changing tax rates and rules for every local government in the whole country, so they don't always show the taxes at time of purchase because they don't know them.
---
If you're still curious, check out tax-rates.org
---
After that, we still have sin taxes for alcohol, tobacco, and the odd occasional federal sales/use tax for things like firearms and fuel.
---
I think you are playing the wrong game.
---
Just played it.
---
Can confirm.

Tryhard with a name consisting of forehead being smashed into keyboard killed me 3 times and somehow wouldn't die, kept crabdancing and ALWAYS oneshot me with marksman+full body armor+helmet.

It surely is, Vault 79 is half open in the art for Wastelanders in the road map.

OTOH, if you're Obsidian, the timing could not have been better.

---
You can't say that for sure tho. I have over 50 blue screen error code dc's logged by my ps4. I have changed nothing and havent had a blue screen in 3 months. Like if it was my ps4 causing those dc's why did they stop?
---
Can't say anything about this guys situation but i guess my ps4 must have revived health for 1 last push like the SBQ. That or the elves that live in my internet fixed it for me

I would agree with you if it were player-placeable junk.

The gaming gods are doing a divine intervention on your computer and saving you from Bugthesda.

Pretty easy to collect most of the important cards for both, then switch as needed. Depends on your specials. Int for stabilized, and luck for one gun army, plus the strength HW damage cards, and of course PA.

How can you create challenging content in a game that basically doesn’t punish you for dying?
---
Unlimited scrap has been a feature of previous fallout games for awhile now without a pay wall, so who? Those previous games. Hell, I redownloaded Fallout 4 recently and got reminded even more just how nice it is to store as much scrap as you please. Unlimited scrap in 3 and NV was handy as fuck. 
---
As for the tent, it gives an advantage to those who have it versus those who don't (saving caps on fast travel definitely adds up), and therefore should also be able to be acquired in game without money. Put it behind a quest with skins for it in the Atom Shop and I'll definitely buy a skin, same as I would for the fridge and collectron if they treated those the same way. 
---
I know this would require you to admit that your subscription gives you an advantage over those without it, but admitting such a thing won't kill you, no matter how strongly I've seen many of you insist that your subscription doesn't give you an advantage over those without. It may put some weight on your conscience, but it won't actually kill you.
---
The modders the real unsung heroes of the community.

Good luck hitting me with a grenade while I'm on my private server!
---
Rust is close.  It can get to about 36 square km in map size before server instability comes into play.  Fallout 76's map is a little over 40 square km.  Also rust is not applying RPG calculations to the objects.
---
I am the victor, until you can prove you are worth a fuck, accomplished anything in the real world, and not in moms basement.
---
Discoursging people from buying and supporting this crap is one of the best ways to do so.
---
Yeah, a few UI bugs that are just sort of annoying (like when dismantling things sometimes the cursor will jump back to first item in list when it usually selects the next). Also I got I think a corrupted auto-save once. Game froze as I was doing a zone transition and when I relaunched and hit continue it instantly froze again. Luckily it autosaves like every 5 minutes so I only lost &lt;5 minutes of progress.

Well, toxic behavior is obviously toxic.  Harassment is inexcusable regardless of how valid someone thinks their point is.  But, again, it's completely reasonable for someone to civilly point out that they don't like what you're supporting with your money when your spending threatens their interests.  It's actually a lot like an election--if enough people vote for these business practices with their wallet, then the practice wins the election.  Just like an election, if you walk around in public talking about whom you voted for, you can't be that mad if people challenge that when they think your vote screwed them over--though you can be mad if they move into toxic harassment.  
---
On a side-note, while I think it's pretty unimportant whether someone's correct that you're damaging their interest (only that they're sincere in their belief)...people arguing it here have a much stronger case than with that TTRPG comparison.  A lot of gaming companies now are doing things that should get them in legal trouble.  This is more akin to supporting Monsanto.
---
Human rights vs corporate greed. Bethesda still comes out on top here
---
Blizzard. Simply because of the fact that their greed bleeds into real world politics. But as far as the worst for the gaming industry definitely Bethesda.
---
Let them stay in their "private" servers.  A game where p2w players have to run and hide from the rest of the community sounds like a beautiful place 😎
---
The timing was indeed VERY terrible but also kind of makes sense. Most of their big titles were pushed back to 2020 or later and the majority of the titles that came out this year have been less than big successes and they needed a a solid revenue stream. First was most likely cobbled together to be that revenue stream. They knew there would be an outcry against it among the fanbase, but they probably didn't expect as big an outcry as they got from the entire gaming community as a whole, which was for good reason and only got louder when the service went live and delivered a whole new host of problems for players.
---
Honestly, just financial reports from other publicly traded companies in gaming. Bethesda isn’t public so we will never know... but an educated guess is that they surprisingly will do well.
---
*On that note though, Zenimax the parent company plans to do an IPO in 2020 so then we can finally find out!*

I have a One X. Just because you are lucky doesn't mean literally every player that has issues is doing something wrong. You'll have to excuse me if I have a life, and don't feel the need to spend hours typing put literally every ftp game to you. If you want to fact check me, feel free. You can easily look up plenty on how poorly the stability of the game has done, how many complaints have been made on several forms of social media about it, and even do a server stability search with several sites. I already work all day with ingrates that wouldn't believe they were on fire, if they were already dead from the burns, and I don't plan on wasting my time with another one on here, especially since I'm not being paid to do it. Tldr: Believe what you want, but if you take some of the time you waste defending Bethesda, and actually look into shit, then you might change your mind.
---
Delayed to 2020 (so I assume it's included in Wastelanders) and it was supposed to happen this spring.
---
Dude use friends only mode like everyone else. Oh wait fo76 charges $13 a month for that(unlike the glorious master looter shooter that is the borderlands series)
---
this is such a tired debate at this point. folks defending a specific transaction in a game will always say 'but that's not a direct win', the industry at large, gaming publications, and the US senate define p2w as anything that '**eases a user's progression through content otherwise available within the game without the purchase of such transaction' --** but really, why is there always such a lengthy debate about what term is used? p2w = p2s (pay to shortcut) or any other acronym you want to create to explain paying more to get an advantage over players who didn't pay more money.
---
It dosent have any noticeable bugs? Some of the newly implemented subscription features have game breaking bugs LMAO, i never seen a company as incompetent as Bethesda, cdpr is much more new to the bussiness, and they can deliver a much bigger and polished game, even EA with all their greed can manage to deliver something more polished than this garbage on its present state. And realy, adding a new travel point and more storage space in a game where you have to craft lots of stuff isnt pay-to-win for you? realy? depending on your playstyle this subscription is a requirement.
---
love what you say
---
Your spelling of, “which”.  That is most definitely the worst.
---
The constant threat of getting attacked and killed by another player. The strive to become stronger than other players (so you can defend yourself - or grief them). Is that not competitive gameplay?
---
And anything that helps you towards that goal faster or easier by *paying* is by definition "P2W".
---
Ark has a very basic attribute system, no perks, and certainly no character concepts that can introduce new interactions with objects.
---
Why would I be nervous about The Outer Worlds? I'm playing it and enjoying it.
---
Just because it's made by people who made other Fallout games does not make it directly related to Fallout 76 in the same way that Destiny is not directly related to Fallout 4, despite Josh Hamrick having worked on the combat systems of both.
---
Yeah, first step was literally the thing people said "on it's only a minor convenience, it's not a big deal, you're being a whiny bitch for complaining about that."
---
Slippery slope may be a logical fallacy, but it was right on a money in this case.
---
First it was repair and scrap kits which were pretty minor. Then they did atom shop camp items like the fridge. Now they do this. I think they wanted to gradually see how much they could do and have enough people defend them.
---
You're a fucktard how is their no disadvantage for those choosing not to pay, when someone can fucking buy a 5 star and blow their ass away.
---
True. Didn't mean that though. What I mean was that it sounds identical to the ones in fallout 4.
---
The same amount of energy being put into a video game can be better used doing Actual things in this world. If yall hate how a corporation does things then cease supporting them at all costs and Actually do something instead of wasting time being a talking head
---
!RemindMe 6 months
---
I'm hoping this game is successful ESO has tons of add ons and would be cool if 76 did too. The map goes on for a while in all directions.
---
In fairness it’s not justified to be angry to pay for private servers, it costs money to host extra servers just for private use, why shouldn’t that cost be passed on to the consumer given it is they who are asking for it. And yes playing offline locally was also an option but then those wanting a private world to play with friends would be complaining.
---
I thought long and hard about it, then reread what you get. The server is great, Atoms are good, the extras are nice, the discounts are cool, but what got me was the more to come though. It's not just what you get now, but what's added next that also sold me. I have a feeling 1st will work out rather nice in the long run. And well screw the rage, its Fallout I'm in it for the long haul and always will be.
---
That's your opinion of the problem, and you're using terms that not everyone agrees with.  P2W doesn't mean 'winning the game' to everyone.  For most (?) people, it means that you can pay money to get advantages over other players.
---
Very few games have a single 'win' state for one player, so no, there's no 'winning' in 76.  But they're moving more and more to allow some players to have an advantage over other players by paying money.  It's minor at this point (though not all will even agree with that), but they've gone farther in other games, and I believe that it's that practice that people here are vehemently opposed to.
---
If I could pick up the game today, pay BGS $50 to have a level 50+ character outfitted with legendary gear, they're still not 'winning' the game.  So, would that be OK with you?  If so, you don't quite have the same opinion as a lot of players you're seeing in here.
---
then what about modded minecraft for example, me and some classmates (about 20 people) got a modded minecraft server that was always online and didn't have any instability issues for 10€ per month. That was about 5 years ago. Maybe cube World could count on as well but I haven't played on big servers so I don't know how that compares to fo76
---
Actually yeah it is. These people deserve to be harassed until they stop supporting fallout fuckyou 1st and Bethesda.
---
He's a idiot
---
You say that like it's a bad thing. Also, shame that they aren't private, since all someone has to do is add someone's gt to their friends list to join the server.....another bug some folks might want to know about.
---
You know as well as i do that people are buying this, a lot of them. It's their fault. And if you hate the subscription but have bought atoms you are a big hypocrite.
---
As much i can hate b(greedlethesda after what they have done blizzard is still much worse.
---
Exactly....you have nothing for me, besides cheesey and lame one liners. You arent living well, or you woulda proved it. I hope you continue to feel cool about being a Reddit warrior while sweating and talking shit in your moms basement.
---
Source?
---
The people that should be banned are anyone that supports fallout fuckyou 1st.
---
Create a punishment for dying? losing aid along with junk was a great feature. Too bad it was forced alongside pvp. Or in the vault raids, being reset to the beginning if you die. Having to start a dungeon from the beginning and risking enemies respawning before you finished is also a problem. They could make it so you take condition damage on all your currently equipped gear on death, maybe a quarter of its current condition or a flat 10-20% of its max condition. Hell, they could even go the FOnline route and have you drop literally everything you have on death for the really hardcore players. That would dwindle out the supply of duped god-tier legendaries at some point, too, while providing a use for the "decent" stuff
---
Maybe not actually uninstall (as in fix the registry things and all), but it could be possible the game creates a folder for temporary assets or something then autodeletes it at the end of a session. Then you just need some bug (which, it is a Bethesda game so that's a given) which screws up the path of what to delete to the base path of the game.
---
That's where my problem is, really hate wearing PA. I don't mind it in the nuke zones. But other than that I don't use it at all. But for some reason carry both an Ultracite PA and X01 PA on me at all times. Lol
---
Thanks for ruining gaming 👍🏻
---
Because it’s important to discuss the specifics. 
---
If I’m not specifically competing with another player, why should what another player does have any bearing on what **my** experience is like?
---
Awesome.  When you drop by I'll get you to hold onto my prized weapons and armour as well.  😉
---
There are a lot of things that get lumped into the term “Pay to win”. It’s not a good term to use for what Bethesda is implementing. They are implementing “Pay to avoid inconvenience”. 
---
In theory, that doesn’t make an impact on anyone’s game but the person paying for it. However, in practice it does, because developers specifically build mechanics into games that are inconvenient—just so they can sell solutions to those inconveniences. 
---
The scrap box is a perfect example of that. Bethesda has implemented an artificial limit on how much scrap players can hold. If you pay, you can stock up on as much as you want. You can spend less time managing inventory and more time having fun. You don’t have to make your friends wait on you every hour or so while you manage your weight anymore. 
---
Obviously, if you don’t pay, you spend more time doing those tedious tasks—which you wouldn’t need to do at all if Bethesda hadn’t implemented the artificial limit in the first place. So in that way, these mechanics—while not paying to win—actively make the game worse for players who don’t pay up.
---
So, do you have *actual* statistics of AAA games with mtx, subscriptions or p2w?
---
When actions don’t line up with what people say they’re going to do or not do it’s a red flag. Always loved Fallout, but with the track record of BGS not sure how it will play out. A lot of players leaving the game, and communities divided. People getting toxic over opinions, it’s just unnecessary squabbling. At this point I am just jumping ship before it sinks. Metaphorically speaking that is.
---
Huh. What’s the exchange rate for $3000 (medical insurance) and $40k (college tuition) over there?
---
What I've seen is that some 76 fans like to bunch them all together like they're a single hive mind. I'm fully aware some YouTubers got the info wrong such as the helmets, but as far as I can tell that was a small minority.
---
I would like to know which ones you consider to be honest. I know people like Cleanprincegaming screw up quite a bit. For me personally, people like YongYea appear to the best in getting to the truth.
---
It is unfortunate that they made some of the areas barren or missing opportunities. Morgantown doesn't have a football or basketball stadium which could have been cool. Huntington is almost non-existent other than the Nuka Cola plant. Any other "live game" could have just expanded on these areas, but that would not fit the lore. 
---
The only option is go to outward. I just don't see them doing that any time soon though.
---
* Online MMO lite looter shooter
---
* Single player RPG 
---
Um no. Like the dumbass news article that someone posted the other day, nobody playing fallout 76 is going "huh, you know what FUCK this game I want outer worlds" that wasn't already gonna get outer worlds.
---
You don't have to hate one game to like another. These games are not similar at all.
---
That's like saying WoW fucked up because now WoW players are gonna go play the new call of duty campaign.
---
This is crazy to me as an American because elected officals actually investigated something on behalf of consumers although a few minutes of googling didn't tell me if they took any action.
---
I just did the Sheepsqautch one yesterday, and really enjoyed it. Plus got some cool animal mounts.
---
Also this Bethesda's outdated engine meme is a missconception of software development.  Just because a game company throws a new version number or a new name for an engine does not mean it rewrote the engine entirely from scratch.  Any programmer worth his salt wants his code to endure and be reused.  In fact I will bet you that every AAA game title has inside of it code written in the 90s, every... single ... one.
---
Bethesda has nothing coming out, so no cash flow. Doom got delayed, Rage 2 and Youngblood were flops, Starfield is years away and TES 6 might as well be decades away. This just seems like a ploy to have a decent show of "growth" and "earnings" to show off to higher ups and investors.
---
Can’t wait for it to carry over into wastelanders
---
My personal biggest conser is the price. If they priced it as something viable, let's say 5 dolars a month and  40 per year plus they made a realistic road map i would be okay with that. But 130 dolars  (500 PLN price in my country)  is a insane price for a buggy and lacking content product.
---
Forgot the period at the end of your sentence...Mr Einstein.

Lmao envy of what? Stupidity??

Follow the yellow marker. It shows a cabin you have to step into without pa.

See my notes on voxel games in the OP.
---
Nope they fully deserve it and this is great. Not everyone wants to ruin video games.
---
To be faird bud we did'nt get private world, rather a private instances for which tgey sacrificed survival servers.
---
&gt; I know this would require you to admit that your subscription gives you an advantage
---
I don't have a subscription.  I don't admit that having a subscription gives people an "advantage" over me.
---
It allows some changes in playstyle, but not ones I care about.
---
&gt; As for the tent, it gives an advantage to those who have it versus those who don't (saving caps on fast travel definitely adds up)
---
Does it?  I'm almost always at max  caps on two characters.  My problem is getting rid of caps, not saving them.
---
&gt;you Fallout 1st defenders
---
Excuse me?
---
Where did I defend fallout 1st?
---
&gt;to being on the same level as Russian election meddling
---
Where did I say that? Please quote me.
---
&gt;there's multiple others who do play the game and are against Fallout 1st. 
---
Yup. I'm one of them :)
---
&gt;So, no, they can't handle the game being criticised.
---
This post isn't criticism. This is like if I said you were a moron for just saying "THIS GAME SUCKS. WORST GAME EVER" and you said I couldn't handle criticism. Saying something sucks isn't criticism. There's plenty to criticise of this game.
---
 You seem to be putting a lot of words into other people's mouths. Probably because you have no real point so you have to make things up by saying the other person said things they didn't or thinks things they don't so you can easily come up with a counter point to something that never happened.
---
That has literally nothing to do with it but good try lol
---
I think a lot of people DID defend this game but there’s no ignoring it now you’d have to be blind dumb and deaf to think they have our best interests at heart or it was an “ accident”
---
Can't blame anyone for forgetting how many lies Bethesda has told. They are numerous.
---
Every time any game releases a micro-transaction or now subscription on top of base game that is more than just cosmetic...this debate comes up. and it's not a real debate. folks defending the transaction will always say that's not p2w coz it's not a direct 'win'...and everyone else says, yes that's a clear advantage to paying user clearly it's p2w. this is tedious and boring. why are you fixated on a word? every time you see p2w just visualize pay-to-advantage. done. debate over.
---
Convenience is an advantage.
---
Don't give Bethesda ideas!!! Omg better get my wallet ready
---
And I specifically stated that if it’s in regards to another player (as in a PvP encounter) then something that allows you to carry more meds or gives access to weaponry would be an advantage. 
---
But the majority of the community has no interest in this. So it begs to question again why so many are upset.
---
Ah you see, for me it's trying to go out and systematically scavenge everything that's entertaining. Even as far back as Fallout NV I joked that these games are recycling plant simulators. You go out, find trash, sort it, and turn it into useful things. Nothing stays unrecycled.
---
The storage cap hinders that because, "I already have a pretty balanced stock of every junk type, there's no need to play now because I can't get a better stockpile".
---
Focus your anger towards Bethesda, not the players. Your breed of toxicity is what really kills games.
---
100$ USD a year for what you get is clearly not worth it. Honestly, if you spent that money on beer and cigarettes and threw a party you'd probably have more fun than having an unlisted stash that deletes your items.
---
You’re absolutely correct in everything you just said. Luckily, THE OUTER WORLDS IS FUCKING AWESOME!
---
I have some free advice for you.  If this game is as bad as your reply indicates, then it's a simple thing.  Stop playing.  If you have already stopped playing, then get off the forums and leave the people who like the game alone.
---
Sitting around and spreading your toxicity isn't going to keep people away.  It just makes you look like a fool.  There is a "block user" function, and I use it judiciously for haters like you who have nothing better to do than troll forums, pissing and moaning about everything.
---
It's a bland game. Too short to justify full price. Open world is pretty meh.
---
If people weren't hyping it up and comparing it to huge open world games with hundreds of hours of content then it would be a decent game.
---
But the fact that you're saying it's better than these 100+ hour games with amazing worlds is only making it seem better than it actually is.
---
keep pacifist mode on, do not incite PVP, and do not bother with workshops. a lot of people easily avoid PVP unless they want to bother with it (in adventure mode) 
---
when i wanna PVP i do so in NW, because there i know everyone is on the same page
---
I have a ps4 Pro and get that error all the time
---
A strange game. The only winning move is not to play. How about a nice game of chess?
---
True actually and I don’t think people get seriously furious about the PtW thing. Got exactly the same opinion like you - no real way to whatsoever win so no PtW. 
---
And imho it’s fair enough to charge for private servers.
---
BUT Bethesda being a big studio once again shows that they don’t have any empathy. They are selling stuff which gives paying users an advantage. Stuff you can’t access without paying.  And even if you’ll never meet a paying player online it still leads to a 2-class-community. So shit we experience in everyday life enters our escapes from reality. It just kills people’s retreats.
---
I don’t disagree with you that the price is steep 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; I personally don't hold out much faith anymore for ~~any sizeable future content~~ the game in general.
---
Hello, That’s pretty specific there, nope, don’t have anything like that anymore. More importantly, this post is for people who don’t have anything in game. If anyone has legacies, explosives, or full sets of armor then this isn’t for you. Please don’t ask me for any top tier weapons or armor, I am dropping all of that to random low levels not on Reddit because I don’t want anyone taking advantage of my kindness. Thank you in advance
---
Honestly the base game kind of did that for me. Why go out and try to scavenge junk I can't store?
---
Gun play is way better than that. Combat is actually fun. Lots of satisfying to use guns and melee weapons. And TTD &gt; VATS.
---
Prove what? Lol and what reason do I have to prove anything to you? You are a person who is so stupid they do not know how to properly use your/you're or commas, and think they somehow win an argument by assuming they live a better life than the other person. You have reached a new level of stupidity that I have not encountered before.
---
Didn't have to potential render static graphics or even animations for each object.
---
&gt;  I don’t know why people are trying to make it look like the people who state obvious facts about the game are just “trying to run the experience for others”.
---
Saying the "game is dying" is NOT a fact - it's just shitting over people who like and enjoy the game. 
---
 Obvious BullShit is obvious.
---
Once again, you’ll have to do your own research. Burden of proof doesn’t rest on me. Hope you find your answer!
---
Really interesting take. Appreciate you leaving some feedback!
---
I have made my peace with FO1st, because it offers nothing to me, so I don't have to buy it, but I think this is more about the "lies" and balancing in that gray area of P2W, and testing what they can do with it. 
---
Now I am not talking about myself here and this is just assumption, but I think people are upset because they don't know what's the future of Beth's games as service model.
---
Meanwhile, I am just waiting for something to do in the game.

yeah it really was i was going to buy the game on that day and on the way to buy it i checked on reddit and then saw the Dumpster fire
---
Would like to see the guass rifle from FO3 and NV, maybe a version/mod that has the crank like in the cc FO4 version
---
I get what you’re saying but due to the lack of support for survival there was never that many survival servers. Again that was down to the fact Beth fucked up survival in a bad way but still I imagine there will be a bigger call for private servers than survival servers.
---
I agree completely and recently posted a similar sentiment trying to understand the internal thinking that could drive this decision. 
---
This is hearsay and conjecture so please take with a grain of salt - I heard Tim from Kinda Funny mention on their podcast recently that Bethesda was possibly being purchased. He didn’t have details and also acknowledged this was rumor - but that this move, and willingness to damage their brand, tracked with a company making mistakes on a path towards possible acquisition - or something. I hesitate to write this because I can’t explain or defend it and of course, I have no fucking idea if it’s accurate. But I’m also curious what led to this in a company that used to feel very connected to its fans now feeling like its’ decision-making and messaging is equally confused and confusing.
---
What's funny is the meme doesn't even make fun of 76 itself but the subscription, but I guess y'all like being good lil piggy banks for Bethesda to just use huh? Here's a tip, want something to improve? Don't support greedy monetization tactics.
---
of course most engines are old, I'm not saying Bethesda should get a new engine but that they should bring it up to current times, I mean look at what cdpr can do for example. But honestly I don't know enough about the creation engine so maybe I'm wrong and the engine isn't an issue.
---
I canceled the update in the middle of the download because it was killing my internet while I was in the middle of doing something else. Later that day I was browsing my game library and FO76 was uninstalled. I don't know why it did that, nor do I care... Haven't played since sometime around March or April.

yea pre-ordering is  a bad idea too glad you point that out, it didn't use to be as bad because game developers use to have finish products, nowadays pre-orders is cash in their pockets so they release a broken game and worry about "fixing" it after launch,   
---
Yea Ever wonder why Pre-order bonus are getting so ridiculous and have more core features?  because that pre-order money is very important to them and they try to make the bait as luring as possible, but it's especially important to their investors because  it's money that comes in Before the game launches,  
---
Now no one knows the future, so making a bad pre-order can happen to anyone, but if the company has a reputation of releasing  broken products and has use pre-order bonus   to incite pre-orders that neither of those are a good sign ,  
---
Sorry for going off-topic a bit, to answer your question yea we all been burnt by a bad game before and is hard to tell even with reviews, for example  fallout 76  had a review embargo (usually not a good sign) so it gets a bit hard to tell whars gonna be broken or not when companies like Bethesda try to hide how broken their product actually is , but honestly  the best course of action, if you stuck with a bad game then stop giving them further money, or better yet just don't play the game anymore, you help your self and you help the company too
---
Good luck. I mentioned this yesterday in a differnt thread. It wasnt well received to say the least.
---
"by Bethesda's definition" lmao. Bethesda's definition has the same merit as my definition. The definition os P2W is having any kind of advantage over another player. End of story.
---
Well, you made an assumption about me wanting free stuff/being broke. So yeah, what im saying holds weight, prove and show me what you got and are worth, then ill go. Then we can end this debate.....just remember this, you started it with your bullshit reply and assumptions.
---
I wonder why so many people downvoted that.
---
I am afraid I missed the part in which you "win". Care to explain?
---
The trick with the tent could always be done by using your C.A.M.P. blueprints by the way. So no game change there, people been doing it forever.
---
Scrapbox scraps stuff for you. So? Can't you just use a workbench like everyone else?
---
And Private Worlds share cool down with Public ones, both lootwise and spawn wise. You have absolutely no advantage, no "increased" spawn or better loot.
---
The only real effect I see is that, it seems, by staying out of Private Worlds you whine more.
---
As a West Virginian...no. Just no.

Extremely anti Bethesda myself but currently pwning all those other players with piles of junk, what you got a TSE and a pvp build then BAM crushed you with 6000 cloth except for that teammate of yours wearing power armor as he suffocated from lack of oxygen as all the cloth stopped him from being able to get oxygen while he was trapped under the cloth!

I would be perfectly fine with it. In fact, there are plenty of games that DO offer the exact same service. 
---
Every time a new expansion comes out for WoW, players get a **free** boost to what was previously the level cap. They are instantly put on par with players that have played since Vanilla WoW. 
---
And no one has a problem with it. Why should we have a problem with it in 76? If someone chooses to skip the infancy of the game, I don’t see what the problem is.
---
Yeah idk why people fall for it.  So easy to bandwagon hate and love with people.

Maybe not this post, but it isn't the only place I've seen this person's comments and you'd better have only nice things to say about Fallout 1st or they're in the comments acting like anyone who's against Fallout 1st can't think for themselves. Both sides are making a fool out of this community at this point. Makes me wish I'd never played the game or that, when I started playing, I stayed away from the Reddit aspect of it.

You don’t have to move your camp to drop a base. So you’re exploring, then when you stop you drop your survival tent, which functions as a sub base, then when you log back in you’re right where you left off.

1) Because it's unfair.
---
2) As long as griefing is possible the advantage gained from paying is going to be a problem. Regardless of what "the majority" thinks. Also, I think you are generalizing.
---
Thank you good sir! This is super helpful for future reference
---
Seriously? you got upvoted for not even contributing to the convo or having a civil discussion. Oh how far we've fallen.
---
Even if you said something I disagreed with I might have upvoted cause it shows you have critical thinking skills, but this is pathetic.
---
You can get legendaries from the store now?
---
okay but what if I am competing with another player, it's a multiplayer game that's not solely built on coop
---
Don't give them ideas. They'll probably put it in the atom shop for 500 atoms.
---
Stop your crying and just quit the game. Enough of the temper tantrums and whining.
---
Short answer is that procedural generation games like NMS create the illusion of simulating a very large world by simulating only the players immediate surroundings with a determinstic simulation highly sensitive to a single number as its initial input.  Each zone gets its own randomly generated input number.  But when the player steps away from the zone that zone ceases to be simulated.  FO76 is different.  I step away from my camp, parts of that camp still get simulated.  In FO76 I can drop something in a location fast travel to a different location come back and still find my bag.  You cant do that in NMS.
---
And I am making another assumption that nothing you have ever said in your entire life has held weight, including this "debate" you have been losing from the start. I will do you a favor and not embarrass you any further, peasant. Just remember this: you chose not to pay attention in school, and must suffer the consequences as an adult.
---
Which is why I've reported your post and hope that you are banned from this sub.
---
Where is this increased camp budget information coming from from? This is not a feature of the service. This misinformation is what is fueling the fire.
---
99% of the posts on this subreddit in the past week have all been against the game. So 99% of the circlejerking has been on one side.
---
And it is true that this sub has suddenly gained a LOT of new users since fallout 1st was revealed. It had 10,000 active users the other day. I've been here since beta and daily users has never been above 4000. That's a TON of people coming in just to complain about fallout 1st that probably haven't played the game.
---
When the outrage dies down (it always does) and the sub goes back to its regular users, you'll start seeing more circlejerking on the OTHER side again. But right now it's very clear that the majority of circlejerking is on this side.
---
No money = no content.  Your statement is subjective.  Mine is accurate.  Life ain't free.  Everything costs money.
---
Yeah it occurred to me after writing that you said you already enjoy sneaking so you probably would have those perks already. So then maybe you're only missing an instigating rifle to double your double or more damage lmao. I was damn lucky 1st day of purveyor got 3* IE lever action rifle been sneaky ever since!
---
What about fallout first do you not like? Would you still hate it if they periodically offered you a free weekend where you could bank your scape, set up your forward camp and so forth?
---
What's more silly is the random gibberish about "few playing". The player base spiked because of this 1st garbage, which means most of us don't have any clue what people really want.
---
I win...cause you clearly have nothing worth showing or talking about that you have accomplished in the real world, or you woulda shared it and shut me up already...PEASANT!
---
How do the scrapbox, tent, and private worlds prevent other players from getting loot and XP?
---
&gt;but then those wanting a private world to play with friends would be complaining
---
What? Just release it as dedicated server software that players can run on their own computers. Nothing (except for greed) was stopping Bethesda from doing this.
---
&gt;It allows some changes in playstyle, but not ones I care about.
---
Your playstyle isn't the only one out there. For those who craft a lot, the scrap box is a huge advantage. For those who don't have a lot of caps all the time, the forward tent is a huge advantage.
---
&gt;Does it? I'm almost always at max caps on two characters. My problem is getting rid of caps, not saving them.
---
Congrats on being at max caps, but that isn't the experience everyone has and even if everyone was at max caps all the time, something that saves you caps is an advantage when it's not accessible to everyone unless they pull their wallets out first. I have yet to break 10,000 caps, and I've been walking everywhere since before the latest meat week in order to save caps. Only time I fast travel is to my camp, Vault 76, or to a friend who's on my team and I can therefore reach for free.
---
Try being a fan since Elder Scrolls Arena kid, I’ve bought every title on or almost on release, and have purchased rereleases and console versions and collectors editions. 
---
But yeah you’re right about the buyers remorse, all of us should feel that about this shitty half baked game.
---
Appa agreed with me, and in his/her original comment they had the atomic shop itself as a starting issue. Lloyd is simply an idiot and not even part of this comment chain, so they don't matter. Why are you even arguing this point? It clearly isn't an issue.
---
Thanks for your input, upvoted.
---
If you are competing with another player then I completely understand and I would understand concerns about P2W. 
---
99% of this sub never has - and never will - partaken in PvP. Yet it seems to be in an uproar over seemingly “losing” to Fallout 1st players.
---
Lol so true I just had a guy on this sub basically say to me “why would I believe you? Just because you say it doesn’t make it true, I read story’s and watch videos online to keep up to date on fo76” 
---
Like why would I believe you when I can believe someone that agrees with me? Lmao
---
Oh. No. Banned from a sub. :/ Life is over.
---
You just can't admit you were poking and prodding trying to incite a reaction and once the bear bit back you couldn't handle it. 
---
Have a good life, please fall off a cliff on accident.
---
Nah I just think it's funny that the stupid guy thinks bragging about stuff over the internet somehow proves something lol
---
You mean Fallout 4 online :P?
---
I'm pretty sure you can build a base, terraform the terrain and stuff, then travel to a different galaxy and come back without anything changing. Stuff like plants will still grow no matter if I'm there or not. Maybe dropped items despawn after a while but that's it
---
As I said, not all consoles age well. Say you've been playing for 16 hours a day for 3 year straight or you happen to have picked up a defect console, shitty things can happen. Maybe your files are corrupt or your cpu/gpu's heating up too quickly. But if most players are having no problem while you are running into one every 30 minutes, it's most likely you are at fault. Not blaming you but that's how it is
---
Imagine wanting to buy a good product from a studio you used to love, yeah that makes me a shill? I don’t think so kid. The shills are those who keep supporting the awful business practices Bethesda has been feeding us since day one of this shit heaps release.
---
I have to disagree because if your going to go a battle pass route you have to go all in and I quite like not having to pay to customise my character. Which would be locked behind a paywall like Fortnite if Bethesda went a battle pass route.
---
I'm not.
---
Quite simply, name me a game company with a similar developer count as Bethesda that is entirely employee owned.  Because otherwise you are dealing with investors and investors far more often than not are trying to get as much money as they can out of their investments albeit some are more patient than others.  In fact, companies that are listed in the public markets like Blizzard and EA have to be even more short term minded than those held by private equity.
---
It does when you basically called me broke and looking for handouts, when im confident enough with what I have that you cant match it to destroy your little pathetic ego.
---
Its all part of the conspiracy, man.
---
Remember that long wall of text you clicked “agree” on when installing and logging into the game?
---
Well, congrats!  You didn’t bother to read it or you wouldn’t be asking this question!
---
I am smarter than you so anything you can do I can better ;)
---
Did you try AtomRPG and Wasteland?
---
One of their board members is Trumps brother
---
&gt;Now getting to the point of this thread: I think the community has lost sight of what “Pay 2 Win” means.
---
&gt;“Winning” implies there is some sort of ending point in the game (there isn’t). That there is an outcome that implies defeating other players in some sort of contest. Or that there is even an initial conflict or contention to begin with.
---
I think you're being too literal with your definition of 'win'. There was a good [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8w417u/what_is_your_definition_for_pay_to_win/) a while back about what the phrase really meant. This is a pretty good summary of it:- 
---
&gt;*Pay to win - a situation where the player can buy in-game content or in-game changes, with real money, that give the player a gameplay advantage or advance the player gameplaywise.*
---
I agree it doesn't impact on my gaming experience, and it's not something I have any real issue with, but it's definitely a system where people pay money for a gameplay advantage. That advantage doesn't affect me and I don't really care, but it *is* there and it *is* behind a paywall.
---
Wow thank you! Sounds crazy.. so you transfer e.g. 12.99$ now and most people just never pay the tax? Lol?
---
I've never heard the phrase sin taxes but yea, we also have them. But we (B2C) pay everything at purchase and the business has to deal with the tax office.
---
If you have the adrenal reaction mutation, That’s why.
---
Except be an adult and live a good life.
---
But you can not even match me in a spelling contest, why embarrass yourself even more?
---
Yes. By killing them. By dying.
---
oooooooooooh
---
it was temporary for a week and thus I don't mind it, everything else made Hines a liar though
---
Apples and oranges, there are no expansions for 76.  They haven't extended the level cap, so there's no catching up.  And WoW doesn't let you buy your way to end-game, so that's a completely different thought.
---
Again, that's fine that you feel that way.  Not everyone feels the way you do though (nor do they all feel the way I do).  I'm just going by what I read, but I think that most people wouldn't be OK with the scenario I described.
---
For me it felt like a mi between Fallout and Mass Effect, with a tad of Starship Trooper satire
---
I have seen this!   Grabs your attention until you realize.
---
There's plenty of notable things in West Virginia that are not on the map or even really alluded to, that could be added to expand the map without introducing any border states. 
---
Like, you could make Clarksburg more significant. We have a popular armory here that I'm surprised is not in the game given how much sense it makes. That's just an example. We have a city called Salem, coulda made that a real supernatural Witchy hotbed like Fallout 4 did with some of their areas. Huntington has a major university in Marshall, that could have been some VTU rival, call them the Thundering Sheepsquatch lol.
---
I could go on for a long time, as I imagine many fellow natives could attest to.
---
I mean they're probably feeling bad about quality of life changes locked behind a monthly subscription, in most paid live service games those are either free or can be earned by just playing.
---
Yo I'll just buy all the content for the irony and then keep playing the game for the irony
---
being that its Bugthe$da, I wouldnt be surprised if true. Enjoy it XD
---
I mean for comparison look at Paradox.  People spent far more money on Crusader Kings dlcs than I have on FO76 even with a a years FO1st subscription, but yet wheres your pitchforks for Paradox?
---
You got the daft part right
---
How is whining on reddit about a game you have no idea about, and using the most childish and petty insults imaginable, being an adult and living a good life? You're confused.
---
I’m pretty sure she was. She’s THE voice of Christmas radio. So much wholesome.
---
Isn't that the point of posting on reddit though? People post to get Karma and those who get the most are featured on drama youtube videos and are treated as primary sources
---
You cant match me in whos living better in the place where it matters most, the real world. I understand why you wont show anything and embarrass yourself further as well.
---
I’m not getting any more legendary mobs on private vs adventure, i did couple runs on westek and WS and on average one legendary in each location per run sometimes 2 if lucky. I read about people claiming there is 4-5 per one run in WS, my guess it’s either the good/bad server theory working on private servers the same as on adventure and some servers have s loot of legendary and other are dry. Other option someone is lying about getting 4-5 legendary per run.
---
I experienced 3-4 legendary mobs per WS run only after dropping a nuke, I’m guessing it’s the same on adventure servers, but as you need to race with other players you are getting less kills overall = less legendary
---
Are you able to actually sign in and play it?
---
Nope...you are, and have nothing to show that you are worth a fuck.
---
This game's way too generous with atom giveaways. I know a guy that's never paid a single cent for an atom and he has most cosmetics. Bethesda must have thought people will actually pay for atoms than grinding challenges
---
Fallout 1st exclusive.
---
Stockholders don't tell the company how to run things.  People expect a return on their investment, but they don't dictate the direct actions of the developers.  When you own more than half of a company, you have a bit more direct say in what goes on there.
---
Yeah, 'Mistress of Mystery' is probably the best in the game in terms of story. 
---
The Grafton Mayor has a good one about a body that needs buried. People might not be aware of it. I don't think it was every widely mentioned in the game ever. They should have had him announce it every time you logged into your camp or something.
---
It was only a week, so it's good.
---
No, it's fucking not, p2w in no way is fucking normal, if Bethesda would get backlash it deserved, it wouldn't be so bad as it is now.
---
EA did better job with BF2 than Bethesda with F76.
---
Just because the majority of circlejerking is on one side, doesn't mean the circlejerking on the other side isn't bullshit. And when you're sitting in the middle, neither completely against the subscription nor completely for it, it's a giant headache all around.
---
If you think every single nonplayer in this forum is here because they hate Fallout 1st, that's not at all true. There's plenty here just to watch the shit show and there's plenty here claiming those who are against the service are selfish greedy bastards because they want some of the features in the subscription to be available to everyone, regardless of the other person's subscription status (because wanting an even playing field is apparently greedy as fuck). Doesn't excuse the nonplayer who are against it, but doesn't mean that every non player here is here because they hate Fallout 1st.
---
Live service gamings problem not mine. Plenty of single player offline games pumping out content without relying on junk subscriptions because they made money on a good game and the content is good for their brand, take Celeste for example.
---
You were, but I'm glad to not.
---
No but I'm sure it makes people feel a little better about the massive betrayal.
---
So many people condemned fallout 1st before it came out and now so many have turned right around and bought it. And others are maaaaad, rightfully so. 
---
I wouldnt grief others for it but I also wouldnt blame them either when they are part of the problem.
---
But I have already shown I am worth ten times the fucks you could ever be.
---
Op you certainly do not speak for all of us. I am glad this subscription is here.
---
Lol that's funny....why would the 99.9%  try to kill the 0.01% that bought it X'''''D
---
Yeah, I actually played it this morning. Didn't actually care until I decided to share this. It's a free game after all
---
 I am not lucky. I'm an old man on a pension. It took about 6 months to get my system, I built recently, together, as I am very poor.
---
 You made a statement and now I'm supposed to back it up. Give your head a shake. As to the game, I play it all the time. Its great and runs very well.
---
This is on ps4 btw
---
This means that Bethesda has caused gamers to rally against the upper class, which is an achievement unto itself
---
Dipshit here, I found money in my entertainment budget so, I will be buying the 1yr subscription when I get back from this work trip I'm on. Shamelessly will I be scrapping and keeping junk,  dancing robot dances and sucking down nuka-cola boisterously. Ask me anything!
---
Inert flux
---
How do you place the tent?
---
I think it's more like people were charged full price for a boring empty broken game and it would appear things that should never have been broken or already in the game are now being charged. 
---
I dont know the full patch notes yet but, so far this is what I have read.
---
The Creation Engine is still the market leading game entity database throughout the entire industry.  It is THE REASON Bethesda is doing Fallout 76 in the first place, because they beleive no other company can compete with them on the mass level of object detail they can simulate for a given set of server resources.  So it's got that going for it.
---
Show me what ya got shit talker, cause im still saying it isnt much...besides a new Reddit account lmfao!!!
---
One of the most civilized disagreements I've read since joining the sub a few weeks ago.  There is hope for our species! 🙂
---
Who actually plays Fallout 76? This game died on release lol
---
I dont play.
---
Ok thanks.   I have been using this for a while, but   wondering if there was a lighter option.
---
Yes you make a strong argument with plenty of examples why this is an easy thing to do. Thank you for your knowledge on the matter
---
You think the gamma gun works better on bloodied players or executioners?
---
Nothing lighter.  Purified water is the same though
---
When did everyone say that? Bethesda is the OG of scummy shit. They were on the horse armor bandwagon way before most other developers.
---
Inert flux and corn soup
---
You can buy characters. And caps. And weapons. Anything you want really. Just not through BGS directly. A 13$ subscription to get a few QoL improvements isn't a bad thing. It's actually good, considering the shoddy financial situation of the game.
---
Coming soon to the atomic shop!
---
It’s seriously out of control.
---
"I challenge you to find an online game that has a higher number of interactive objects in the world multiplied by the number players per world."
---
That's what I responded to. You never said anything about graphics.
---
But if graphics are a prerequisite, there's also Ultima Online, Everquest, Anarchy Online, just to mention a few games dating back to more than 20 years ago.
---
They were always going to charge for private servers. How much was the only question. Now we know. $12 a month. Maybe they'll drop it, I don't think with them it'd be the Reverse Bait and Switch, with them I think it really would be "Oh shit we fucked up let's walk this back a bit." At least I hope that's what it'd be.
---
No real way to know without seeing the marketing schemes they've come up with, but eh.
---
Having mods are always fun no matter the game. Seems worth a try at least once they're implemented
---
See you soon future me
---
I just tried this because everything was dead and left and immediately came back to the same server with same nuke zone. Sweet.
---
Honestly Ive been loving OW and highly recommend it to people who miss a singleplayer game with no outside influence and microtransactions. Plus the plot is hilarious when you think about the critisism bethesda recieved just prior to launch. Corporate Commanders and whatnot
---
Actually just started bf1 cause of EA access, still has more playability than fo76 right now lol
---
Cheers partner 🍻!
---
Yes, but thanks for the suggestions. 
---
Played both the original Wasteland, and the remake. And yes to AtomRPG. Those are more akin to the originals  (Fallout 1 and 2).
---
I actually grew up on games like Wasteland and Bards Tale.
---
Having said that, I really wanted something like New Vegas, since I consider that to be the best Fallout. And TOW delivers in that aspect.
---
They either never should have introduced a subscription to begin with or stated at the beginning that they were going to be doing that so people could go in with their eyes open
---
you didn't need to rush, datamining has revealed half a dozen of ranger armour variants to come
---
If that happened, if they announced a DLC (as they have with Wastelanders) and then pull the plug because not enough people bought their shitty sub service, I get the feeling you'd be looking at a mass exodus the likes of which haven't been seen since EA's "Pride and Accomplishment."
---
I found a three star scorched beast fighting the robots at RobCo. They hit crazy hard and I'm well geared.
---
Maybe the game was the one who wanted a way out.
---
 Bloodied players are at 20% health. A good stagger from a Heavy Weapon or a Gamma Gun and they dead.
---
 Well there's more to it than that, but only Bloodied players have a chance to kill me.
---
I mean, I'm down voting you, but you made me chuckle, so I'm going to feel bad about doing it.
---
100% agree! This is personally one of the best OSTs in any video game. Tied with Oblivion for me.
---
No other games have had this problem and I ve got platinum in like 8 different games over the past year. If the problem was soley my ps4 other games would be crashing as well and that hasnt happened. The error log is hilariously page after page of 76 and then it stops for me. Which would show they fixed something on their end that stopped the crashes for me
---
Just weights more than inert flux.
---
Ive also noticed a buff to enemy difficulty. Might just be me though. Which would be a good thing because this game is already too easy.
---
What are ya mad because I have less time on reddit and more karma? Lol
---
One man's slippery slope is another man's foot-in-the-door technique.
---
Yep, that was the line in the sand, and man the community just pushed us right across it.
---
When the game is so broken it uninstalls itself.
---
I ran into him there this morning, not realising that that was where he was. I popped in through the back of the building and heard a child ask "mommy" if they could come out now. I noped out of there and came back with a teammate and that's when we heard The Silver Shroud start talking and found him hovering around the front.
---
But, you not having fun, "winning"?
---
You don't need to be upper class to buy a cheap subscription.
---
How likely is it that they are selling to Chinese companies/investors... They are really moving to a games as service model and tho they keep saying it's a Side project, not once have he heard any news of starfield.
---
 Corn Soup. Food and drink at half the weight. ;)
---
Bethesda Studios is worth $2.5 billion, if they can't pay their staff without "micro" transactions and bullshit like that, they need to move industries and start again.
---
There doesn't need to be an "opponent." It gives an advantage over other players. End of story.
---
Well they are making you pay for something like private servers. If it's necessary to pay for those, how do games like Minecraft let you play in worlds with other people for free? Plus it's just fixing an issue they caused. Like bad hit detection.
---
That and they said everything coming to the game would be free as long as it wasn't cosmetic.
---
So they lied there.
---
They also lied about the stash limit causing performance issues.
---
This game's quite demanding. Even gtx1080 won't grant you stable 60fps. You can't expect much from a console that's been out for six years. I do think the game shouldn't be too demanding tho. It looks like shit
---
I'm willing to bet they'll give fallout 1st players a free 5 star legendary once they start popping up, and somethinf ridiculously good too. But then again that would help against griefing against other players who don't like them.
---
Im not mad at all...Im actually having a blast knowing you are a piece of shit that hasnt accomplished shit in life, and you can not prove otherwise...or you woulda lmfao!!!!!!
---
Wild Appalachia was great, but the Nuclear Winter season was awful. Only pve content broken 'raids', overpriced cosmetic bundles that relied on fomo, instead of making the scrap station and fridge quest rewards (like they did with the backpack/brewing) they just try to sell it to us... Its been a dumpster fire.    
---
Those cosmetic packs cost more than Far Harbour did.
---
I’m still caught in the middle of deciding honestly. A lot of these posts, a lot of YouTube videos, a lot of Tweets have hammered my brain into a very negative head space for the game, but despite it all, I’m still sitting here at work thinking about how much fun I can have when I get home and play. Overall I wish we were in the timeline where Wastelanders released this week, and instead of Fallout 1st, private servers were just a section of the patch notes
---
Yeah, I agree!
---
Maybe they'll add a map that we can load in to vs. expanding the current one. That'd be awesome fun.
---
Yeah, it would be interesting to find an early version of Megaton.
---
I paid for it and I'm loving it but I think they should allow players to pay the subscription with atoms or remove the scrapbox and the tent, put the ranger armor in the atomic shop and make the subscription cheaper  for people who want to play in a private server but with no advantages.
---
It isn't though. The game might turn into that later, I haven't beaten it yet, but the first half of the game at least is more "save the Hope", not "take down the Board". In fact, early quests even reinforce this idea that the corporations will just recover and rebuild, and the ordinary people can't escape. The game even goes so far as to show you corporate propaganda twisting your actions into service to the Board, regardless of what you do.
---
Why reward Bethesda for such a poor offering? I get that you can afford it. But, unfortunately, this is capitalism. If we bug shit, companies will offer shit. Does it really seem like a good deal to you??
---
Obviously paying for legendary gear would be p2w
---
But the point OP makes is that having extra storage space does not, its simply a convenience
---
And winning in this posts context would be pvp
---
If one could pay to have a signficant advantage in pvp
---
Therefore the term p2w doesnt apply here
---
If you use p2w but actually mean p2 have an advantage then its you who is in the wrong because win and advantage are two different things
---
Not trying to hate at all, but did they say or has there been any data yet to show a spike or increase due to 1st? Just interested in the data is all.
---
I mean it’s hard to do private servers and they’re charging a hell of a lot less than some other companys
---
What did you expect? lol
---
and after what obsidian did with outer world.... bye bye wasteland
---
This is all hilarious to a day one hater.
---
It also explains the cliff diving that happens in Collision Course. I’d opt for suicide, so as to not hear the complaints that all I have is a sickle and a coffee mug.
---
\^\^\^ THIS
---
Well, either there's a lot of new players or a ton of people suddenly decided to reroll new characters. Seen a HEAP of new players coming out of 76 since the 1st launch. At least 20, and I've only played for a few hours. You can find other people experiencing the same thing, even on this generally toxic sub.
---
It's possible it's all people rolling second toons, but I doubt it. We'll never get hard numbers.
---
Providence Equity Partners isn't a Chinese equity firm, they're US based as far as I can tell.  I don't think that Zeni has the presence in China that someone like Blizzard does, so I don't think that really comes into play here.
---
That's not a good thing? That's literally half the point lol
---
Half of these kids have no clue what business is and don’t realize that based off of market situations the company had to adapt. It’s a pretty hard concept for some but that doesn’t mean they should keep throwing tantrums. It’s time for them to quit whining. 80% of the trade pages are this crap which is what’s truly ruining the game. They should be a little more mature and try to look at the whole picture and not just their perspectives. They can down vote me all they want to. It’s just a game lol
---
They are fun now though. lol
---
No, it's realistic. Complaints and discussions on an internet forum with limited reach will change neither industry trends nor consumer spending. 
---
And sure, that would be $20million here, but for every person here there's a couple dozen who aren't.
---
Anyone that does this is a great person who actually cares about video games and consumers.
---
1. PvP is voluntary
---
2. Dying loses you nothing
---
3. Nothing in FO1ST gives you an advantage in PvP
---
There were also costumes available in game that gave the same bonus for that week.
---
Except loving a game but not putting up with the bullshit from the creators isn't hypocritical. It's called loyalty.
---
They want the game to flourish but dont like how things are being handled, and since the idiots that actually bought the subscription to a game already at Triple A game price when it's incomplete, and the only way to get them to listen is to not buy it, which has now essentially stripped a large portion of the player base's ability to fight back. So they are fighting what they can.
---
Bethesda isn't going to ever listen to what you guys want again without figuring out a way to make money off of it.
---
Tons of people were vocal they didnt want a battle royale mode, guess what you guys got. You guys made suggestions and now they are selling them back to you. And this latest piece of bullshit? Now whenever someone complains about monetization Bethesda is just gonna point to fallout 1st sales and shrug.
---
Good fucking job, y'all screwed any chance of your game ever truly getting fixed.
---
It literally will?
---
Bollocks.  
---
Supporting the development of the game by buying a dress is significantly different to supporting pay-for-advantage/convenience items like repair kits, the fridge, the scrap station, the scrap box or the private worlds that like you farm workshops and farm ledgendries without competition.
---
Well, I did mean in game.

P90 from FOTactics would be cool. Always loved the P90

Fuck Pete Hines
---
So you're only a "loyal" fan of Fallout if you paid for microtransactions in Fallout 76. Okay, got it.
---
That's why so many people are taking issue with it. Lots of us, myself included, wanted private servers. Similar to the offerings basically every other multiplayer game has or offers.
---
In time with mods coming people could setup private servers to host their own persistent fallout world that they could in time mod and change and create something similar to what people in F4 have been doing with Sim Settlements.
---
Instead we got "private worlds" which are similar to a World Of Warcraft instance.
---
I would have been happy to pay for a private server, instead they mislead and misdirect people who don't associate the difference between the two.

Fuck off its a creaking ten year old game
---
It's not our fault you can't manage a stash limit.
---
Your opinion is unpopular because it's just wrong.
---
I agree that 'win' in P2W doesn't mean what the word strictly says, I'm just saying that most people understand that 'winning' isn't a necessary component for a P2W situation.
---
I also don't strictly agree that the FO1st is particularly P2W.  It's an edge case, at best.  But it's *another* step in that direction - not the first, and a lot of people are afraid that it won't be the last.  
---
Look at ESO or Elder Scroll Blades and how they've monetized those games.  That's what people here are afraid of, in my opinion.
---
I do not see it as rewarding anyone, except me. I also do not see it as a "poor offering".
---
This isn't class warfare, writing off the people who aren't dumb enough to buy the sub as poor is an excuse not to look deeper at the situation and write it off.
---
I haven't played since beta, but yeah constantly over-encumbered, with mutations and perks and excavator PA my base carryweight  is 440 drugs/food/alcohol can get that  up to 490/500 but usually have to dump stuff to FT
---
If you refused to help support the game then no, you aren't really a loyal fan. You just wanted everything handed to you for free, and expected that to just continue to happen, despite a negative revenue stream. If you truly care about something, you understand that it requires a little give and take. Not just take.
---
!remindme 3 years
---
Nope, bought that shit at 60$ and it was half finished. That weren't getting another cent from me
---
Always hear people talking about datamining but never  understood what it meant what is it?
---
The mental gymnastics needed to hold your viewpoint are unbelievable.

No really can you pacify Super Mutant’s like animals, or is this a hint at a future NPC/camp companion

Now everyone is a marketing god and expert businessman... geez just move on
---
What if the only way to take the fight to Bethesda was for people to not buy the subscription?
---
Because after a year it's obvious they only care about money.
---
Lmfao. 🤣
---
I just dont have money
---
But you are not smart enough to make that assumption, so you are just showing how dumb you are again
---
How **fake** it is comes from your idea that everything you disagree with is **fake**. Legitimate criticism and feedback is what the site is for. Reddit is for the opinionated posts and rants
---
Edit: also not a Bethesda employee, but it’s obvious they have looked away from Reddit feedback as it comes from a pretty small corner of the community
---
Remember when you just had to buy the game once and that was all you had to do? Maybe an expansion? And it all worked? Seems like a distant past now.
---
Edit: I know it's a different game, but No Mans Sky had a shitty release. They went about fixing the game without their damn hands tryin to rummage through my pockets every week
---
Those with 1st will receive map expansions it's so worth getting 1st funny joke
---
IDK what you talking about because I'm too lazy to read, But I'm sure I disagree
---
You say that till you rise up in arms over something you are passionate about. Then you will sing a different tune.
---
No matter if those people are aware or not they are part of the problem. And a lot of people want the problem gone.
---
You again with your "mental gymnastics".
---
It's reality. Anyone who refused to help support the game through the Atom Shop, that is now complaining about the subscription, has no right to complain about it. If anything, they are the direct cause of the subscription. If the Atom Shop had been more successful, the subscription wouldn't have been necessary.
---
Which is all still fine by me, I've wanted a subscription just like this for months. I was ecstatic when they made the announcement. I'm a loyal fan of the franchise, and don't expect an online RPG to just magically fund itself.
---
The Outer Worlds is developed by Obsidian, the creators of Fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas. It's pretty god damn related. Honestly, it's far more of a stretch to distance them than it is to notice the completely obvious.  
---
The game was announced with the tagline "Made by the ORIGINAL creators of Fallout"  
---
It's related admin and this post is kinda pathetic quite frankly
---
Oh the mental security and comfort being so judgemental must bring.
---
It's not our fault we didn't have to buy any atoms. Bethesda was too generous and gave away too much atoms for free so F you Bethesda. You screwed up as always
---
Most of the new quests are easy to find. They put up bulletin boards at all the train stations, and put up posters to start the pioneer scouts, nukashine and sheepsquatch quests.
---
Semi auto is still pretty viable, most popular rifleman builds seem to be junkies and bloodied. The gear to run those builds is insanely expensive now, you're looking at 30k on the low end for a full kit to upwards of 200k.
---
But realistically, any build can be viable, you'll just have trouble with the bullet spongier enemies. I run a basic stealth crit rifleman build on one character and it holds up pretty well, doesn't need super expensive gear to run it.
---
Edit: also, if you're lvl. 150 and have a bunch of perk card choices stocked up, you should be able to respect pretty easily.
---
You replied to the post bud not a comment.
---
You are showing what little you have and accomplished in real life.
---
Maybe we get the trick, and THEN the treat?
---
Bethesda had always been known for buggy games. They've had the nickname Bugthesda for over a decade now. The depth of the games and their characters has always been phenomenal though. 
---
This is a different game genre. This isn't something where it's released and then there's nothing done to it until the next DLC or installment. It requires maintenance, updates, patches, a full time team working on nothing but stuff for this game. It HAS to have a positive revenue stream, or they'll just scrap it all together.
---
It definitely would have helped.
---
It's almost like Bethesda keeps making the same mistakes over and over again which requires even more videos.  
---
yeah screw those guys informing the community, what haters
---
It was so frustrating having to manage my stash weight every day or every other day. As long as they keep adding exciting new thing to the game and to First members I'll be glad i bought the membership. I'm happy with it so far.
---
Difference being those MMO's are'nt bug ridden messes charging rediculous amounts for items and the Private Servers ARE Private.  Not a free for all like Bethesda for anyone to join. Keep your head in the sand where it belongs.
---
I dont think ANYONE needs anymore convincing. Do. Not. Buy. Anything. From. Bethesda. I hope that message goes clear through all us fanboys out there. DONT FUCKING BUY THEIR SHIT. Period.
---
But I have to say that I very much hope that support for mods will come soon, because otherwise private servers do not offer much value for me.
---
Gameplay got better with 4, but writing took a huge nosedive.
---
Everyone loves to fall back on that excuse "take it out on Bethesda", which would be viable if we didnt have a year's worth of proof showing they dont sweat the anger at all.
---

---
Its unbelievable...... putting the final nail in the coffin of quality content.
---
Who died and mad you king?
---
There really isn't anything to praise that shouldn't just be a given. What do you want? "Fallout 76 justifies it's price tag because emotes are free sometimes"?  
---
I suggest you log into reality where this game is, was, and will continue to be utter garbage. I'm sorry it took this dramatic of a screw-up to alert you to the obvious but Bethesda deserves so many things and PRAISE is not one of them.
---
"the player base spiked" is a load of crap. I play on a VERY large discord server and the numbers have suddenly DROPPED and people are openly saying they are moving onto other games.
---
I have to emphatically disagree. The stash box, and particularly the fact that scrap counts against it, is primarily what drove me away from this game after 20 hours rather than the 1250 I've sunk into Fallout 4. 
---
The scrap-stashing problem has two huge consequences: 1) it makes adventuring less satisfying because you know that most of what you bring back will end up either thrown out or needing to be sold immediately (which itself can be an obnoxiously time-consuming task); and 2) it effectively punishes you for adventuring by constantly forcing you to engage in extensive inventory management, well above and beyond the already-considerable level of such management in Fallout 4 or the Elder Scrolls. For me, these two factors tipped the scales as to whether or not the game was even worth playing. 
---
That said, I can appreciate for your sake that a scrapbox is an optional feature; but god almighty, they need to release it to everyone for free ASAP as far as I'm concerned. I can't be the only one in this boat, given that the stash-scrap issue was the most unanimous complaint on this sub at launch.
---
You’re playing yourself. Lone Wanderer and all that shit. The only time your playing yourself is if you’re beating off.
---
They did that to help supplement what people bought, and because there's a swath of VERY vocal players that expect everything for free. They still counted on the more loyal fanbase to invest money in the game, knowing that it would go towards development. They basically gave us an honor system, and we snatched the candy and ran off without putting any money in the jar.
---
Yeah all over reddit
---
Yeah. It notifies me but cant read it.
---
It literally wont?
---
World is already full of cunts. Be original for a change.
---
I found mine for 800 caps lol
---
Thanks for the info and I’d say I’m reasonably close with them :)
---
If it let you stack 15 stacks of things, that'd be useful.  15 items total... Bleh.
---
Says the guy trying to do that very thing himself lol.
---
Same. For $13 it's totally worth it, just for the Atoms alone even.
---
So let's hate YouTubers for being greedy but Bethesda is a-ok?  
---
Y'all really will jump through as many hoops as possible to justify your mistake of purchasing this 'product'
---
I agree with you wholeheartedly. I'm just a casual player, I think my highest level character is like 50ish. I'm trying to just mull things over, because while I like the idea of the scrap box (I'm a hoarder, I like to have junk on hand to build things when I want to redo them) I can't justify spending 12$ a month for it. I play solo, I wouldn't have need for slots on a server as it'd be just me playing... Atoms are nice, as I do like customization, but I earn them. Well, scratch that, I used a $20 card I got from a friend on my birthday on some.   I love the Fallout world, and I've justified and defended it since it's very buggy release... but all this does is make me want to pack it all up, and go back to my heavily modified Fallout 4.
---
That's the dumbest thing I've read in a long time. I own every Fallout game released since 1997, including the infamous Brotherhood of Steel for Xbox. I've been a fan of the franchise since the release of the first game, long before Bethesda came into the picture, secured the IP and decided to take a huge shit on it. So don't give me that crap. If you wanna throw all your money at Bethesda then be my guest, but don't tell people they aren't "loyal" fans because they don't succumb to corporate greed.
---
doesnt matter since guns dont seem to work right anyways
---
lol ;-)
---
but i got muh axe so im good
---
Yes
---
And you think taking it out on the players minding their own business helps? You really think Bethesda is gonna give a shit then? No, I don’t think they will. 
---
You’re just being a dickwad taking it out on people minding their own business, but honestly I blame Bethesda for painting such a big target on people who bought their service, knowing how toxic people can be about shit like this.
---
There you go, wrong again. Difference is I am right, you are wrong, me smart you dumb
---
Can’t even see the comment I just made here.
---
Think what's gotten me the most annoyed is how players that got 1st are apparently being treated
---
I know West Virginia or "Appalachia" is lush with stuff like where I live in East Texas I live in the Rose Capital of the world! But it would never be major town if there was Fallout 112 with the entire state of Texas.
---
I think this is a good reasen they did it. I´m not saying it is good but have a look at this perspektive.
---

---
I'm more to than willing to fund additional content for good games: that's why I currently sub to FFXIV, and I previously subbed to ESO. But Fallout 76 is emphatically not a good game, and anything Bethesda does to make it a good game instead of a bad game should not be behind a paywall. It sets a bad precedent for a company to release a defective product and then ask the customer to shell out extra money on top of what they already paid to fix said product.
---
OP's mom will always be free DLC
---
Really? Then why did F76 flop hard?
---
If my job was to listen to this sub, I’d quit. I don’t care if the rent is due tomorrow. Robbing a bodega and risking prison would be preferable. My life would be a living hell either way.
---
If they want to avoid this abomination of a sub for a few days, I think it’s well deserved.
---
I am whole heartedly envious of the level of ignorance displayed by those defending the purchase of such a shitty service.
---
My life would be bliss if I was constrained to such a limited consciousness.
---
not pay to win if you play solo on your own server ;-)
---
Bulletin board at train stations... Yes. Yes. No.
---
People that actually participate in bullshit like this is the reason why the gaming industry keeps screwing everyone over. They know asshats will actually buy into it. Then all we are left with is an industry that doesnt even try to make a quality game...they make shit...and make you pay more for it. Its beyond ridiculous.
---
Imagine complaining about what others do that doesn’t affect you.
---
LUL
---
Bethesda fucks up and affects these Youtubers, so they can voice their complaints as they want.
---
thats typical for a lot of games and such though isnt it?
---
Exactly! I was talking to a friend and they said I heard about the $100 FO76 DLC that's more then the game itself! The perception outside of the FO76 community is that its a DLC and not a private server for the same game content. Terrible marketing, terrible timing, it just feels like Bethesda is tanking FO76 on purpose at this point.
---
With the Unofficial Community Patch.
---
i want a 5 star axe.
---
fuck the guns most of them are broken lol
---
Skjor ? The bastards killed him !
---
Cant show off their cool cosmetics that is going to cost them more than the base price of the game eventually on private servers.
---
Let's be real they aren't even private servers, they are private **instances**.
---
Difference is I live better, you live in a shitty situation, you dont have much money, me do you dont.
---
They could’ve just removed the junk limit for everyone and created great content instead?
---
Your pretty much paying for atoms every month with everything else being free. Hopefully they add more additions every month as free or discounted items. I also cant see any comments on your post.
---
actually for the atoms alone is actually cheaper then buying the atoms directly. and as others point out you can keep the exclusive new Vegas armor after cancelling the subscription...
---
Exactly like I always took pride in how nice this community was but then they go and do this
---
Happens on individual servers regularly.  Doesn't mean they're all going down, just the one you were on at the time.
---
Were you invited on a private world? If so the owner might have gone off for a while (to Adventure or crashed) and come back before the time expired.
---
I'm speculating as I don't own 1st and don't know how the closing down works. I wouldn't be surprised if they recycled the maintenance message for private servers shut down.
---
Mark my words: nobody gives a fuck.
---
Cool. Maybe they'll include that in my subscription, too?
---
The support I gave Besthesda and other devs simply by buying games helped them become companies with profits of hundreds of millions, before there was one single micro transaction available to buy. Stop being a sucker, and start behaving like a rational consumer.
---
Oh, and ESO as a game is a million times better then FA76, stupid comparation.
---
And where are the female Super Mutants? Pink weapons and armour? C'mon, who doesn't wanna see that? 😜
---
suprised they got rid of it so quickly
---
to be honest the base game is kinda survival enough for me though lol dammit i need more pumpkins why did i forgot where i found em!
---
In an ideal world, the $12 isn't a lot at all. You get a ton of atoms each month and a private server for other games ranges from $10 for Minecraft to like $30 for bf4. $12 just didn't seem like a big deal.
---
The level of delusional here is completely unreasonable. How about Rust, ARK, hell even Minecraft? Games that not only have all these features and more but also actually function properly and have mod support?  
---
It's people like you that have given Bethesda the confidence to screw their consumers. Bethesda could slap you and take your 60 bucks out your pocket and you'd probably thank them for their innovation.
---
Wait are all scorchbeast a legendary now? Hell I’ll play if that’s the case
---
Yeah, this is the second post I cant see comments for
---
That's minecraft. It's a very basic game, with basic graphics, and basic mechanics. It doesn't have a third of the complexity.
---
I just hope this is a lesson to consumers not to let this shit fly in other games now.
---
Just Reddit doing the thing it did only a month or 2 ago again. May be fixed in the next hour or two. Maybe less
---
Yes. For that, you'd be looking at what, maybe 0.5% of $13 in some cases? It would cost you more to mail a check for 6.5 cents or more in gas to drive your pennies over to the tax office, and it would be the same the other way costing the city or county government more to even send you a bill than they would collect.
---
Even on a bigger example, let's say a $1500 laptop you ordered online and a 2% county sales tax that was avoided. It would cost the sheriff's office more time and money to come get the $30 from you.
---
Ideally, what we're supposed to do is once a year summarize all of our online purchases where the taxes were not collected and then pay the 3 government levels what we owe. It's ultimately the consumer's liability that the taxes be paid. Businesses calculating and collecting them for us is somewhat a convenience but it's also a way the government can offset the burden of enforcement. It's cheaper to audit 1 business than it is 10 consumers.
---
Almost all. I would say 7 in 10 are
---
i like the world its just has some big issues like guns seem to be broken but melee works for me lol
---
They lubed up and took it an inch at a time
---
Only thing that’s pathetic is “shaming” people for spending their own money. You really think the subs are gonna run off when all you guys are doing is wasting ammo? LMFAOOO
---
Fallout 1st is the name of the subscription service.
---
yeah pc has fov and higher res and other stuffs. i prefer pc i did play it on the xbox one during the stress test tho
---
You think your discord server is representative of a games population? Really? Ever think you're hanging around people with the same mentality as you, and you're circlejerking each others opinions? Because you are.
---
You don't even need to take anyones word on it here. Log into the game yourself and stand by Vault 76. It takes  about five-ten~ minutes for a new player to come out. Been giving the new players schematics whenever I've been logged in. 
---
I'm sure its a coincidence though.
---
If only that translated into a successful and well-crafted video game.  
---
You know what was groundbreaking and innovative? The Phantom Menace. You know what's a terrible film?   
---
The Phantom Menace.  
---
You are praising ideas on paper and not looking at the trainwreck that is the reality of Fallout 76.
---
Google
---
Crusader Kings didn't release to such controversy nor did Paradox ever make any statements regarding microtransactions or additional content. Another example of a game you don't see catching hate all over the place is Train Simulator. The 2019 release has a total steam cost of over 3k with all dlc. 
---
Bethesda's moves over the last few years have all been questionable. Re-using the same engine and files, releasing even more buggy versions of their games, their PR people, dev team, and marketing all not bothering to get talk to each other, and especially going back on statements made to the community.
---
Many in the community that loves their games feel lied too and betrayed. In the end, the only thing we can hope for is their next release fails really hard but not hard enough to kill the company and they get their shit together.
---
What the fuck. A subscription for a paid offline game? Then how the fuck are they being bullied about it online
---
The plans can be obtained at whitesprings bunker, so you can craft your own, but you need to do some missions before you can enter it
---
The subscription model is not the problem. Everyone knew it was coming with private servers, the problem is that these aren't private servers and if they don't evolve consistently modding will be a joke.
---
Plus there us the whole pay to win and locking your fans suggestions for *content* (not cosmetics) behind a paywall. The price is also a problem in a number of ways, for example, how non-US players are basically taxed for not being US players.
---
they can take your crops and water though? i was a bad bad Fallout guy and stole some purified water. lol i sowwy
---
hey the wasteland is tough!
---
You're so far in the deep end of stupidity Reddit wont even let me see how stupid your comebacks are becoming. Now that's funny. Good luck being an idiot, loser, and whiny little pansy!
---
Where is the competitive advantage? Can you kill stuff faster because you now have more stash space available? Does the extra junk you get from private server workshops make you harder to kill?
---
Sure if Bethesda started adding stuff like 4/5 star legendaries or special perk cards for 1st members that would be considered P2W and I would quit the game instantly, but so far they seem to be trying to copy some of the monetization aspects from ESO(another game owned by Zenimax) which has no P2W elements, for now atleast.
---
Borderlands offers the same shoot-and-loot loop without any of the bullshit AND has free DLC.
---
Oh fuck you lmao.
---
But, some people have something, that other people don't have. We can't have a discussion, we must RABBLE! Rabble, rabble, rabble. Rabble, rabble.
---
My gamertag is Orang3duky. I'm a fairly low level too, so if you're interested I'd be more than willing to help you out in leveling up!
---
You learn how to craft the X-01 Power Armor by reading an entry on the Archival Terminal in the Whitesprings Bunker's armory which you can only access after completing the Officer on Desk quest.
---
No, my opinion is unpopular because it's how the silent majority feels about the situation, and I'm just willing to post it because I don't care about reddit karma.
---
I managed my stash limit all the time. I left because I had run out of things to do, and got tired of struggling with the stash every day. Now, I can come back and farm junk to my little heart's content and not worry about it consuming my stash.
---
My enjoyment would come from this awful, incompetent, lying, greedy company not getting the cash cow they wanted and all the people who enabled and defended their terrible practices learning why they shouldn’t. Yeah, I’d enjoy that a lot!
---
Neither of those things are related to gameplay
---
Then there's this lol
---
https://taxfoundation.org/states-sales-taxes-software/
---
Your entire arguement is based around the premise that 1. Bethesda is actually trying to fix the game. 2. The bullies aren't also fans of the game pushed past their boiling point with the level of insanity and stupidity of the people willing to buy the sub to insanely shitty services that should already be in the game.
---
If I remember correctly, during the enclave quest line you're given a full set and the plans.
---
So it’s free? I did all the enclave quests except for I am become death.
---
i wish private servers could get npc companions even if they dont have any real dialoge just could help you in battle if you play alone lol
---
Imagine being this stupid and this clueless lol ouch
---
You got ripped off!
---
Whatever, 100 caps is something I can make selling a bunch of level 10 weapons from scorched LOL
---
Ok I can read all your  comment on computer but not on my ph....hang on can now read 2 out of 6 on ph. Lol
---
For $10 a month you can get hundred something games on Xbox, including the brand-new Outer Worlds.
---
 i using the regular box for now since im low level not even close to filling it. hopefully updates will come Soon (TM) to fix the bug.
---
 Its only the traders and various other low life that are impacted by the stash box. ;)
---
Im the loser...says the guy who still cant prove he is worth anything, or has accomplished anything in life....still waiting on those links to some legit proof or screenshots or vids....SOMETHING...ANYTHING, prove me wrong you worthless loser.
---
Because people supporting this crap are the reason games are becoming...crap.
---
It's free to learn how to craft a full set, yes. But you'll obviously need the materials to do so.
---
[https://youtu.be/TUFHuYMG-nw?t=39](https://youtu.be/TUFHuYMG-nw?t=39)
---
I'm going to have to ask for some sources on that. That's very borderline conspiracy theory. I'm no fan of what's going on with Fo76 by any metric, and I'm even less happy with the way Bethesda has been handling the situation, but with accusations such as that, one would expect you have some measure of proof to back it up.
---
And, since it's you making the claim, burden of proof falls to you.
---
Hell yes! And on the private server too.
---
Bethesda had always been known for buggy ass games, and they've all had content added after the fact in the form of paid DLCs.
---
How have you made it through life up until this point? You must have it real easy if you've managed with this level of intelligence and this amount of critical thinking lol
---
I've generally had a better than average experience ever since I bought the game during the free week so my experience might not be helpful, but I haven't been consistently disconnected in months. Last time it happened was on my first login after patch 14, the one before that was probably when the laser trap exp glitch was still around.
---
guns seem to be broken for me. sometimes they work most times they dont do any real damage......so im like fuck it and scrapped my guns for now and just go melee lol hopefully they might fix some of that soon (TM) 
---
cuz you know it would be NICE to have guns work in a ...mostly gun based game lol.   but i like the world and exploring so im ok for now lol
---
Well, I personally would worry about how I'm going to make more money if I couldn't afford $13 a month. Video games would have to take a backseat to life.
---
It’s called “censorship.”
---
Junk jet is in the game files, just prevented from dropping.
---
No, it still isn't Fallout 76.
---
Except that's not what pay to win normally means. Pay to win refers to advantages that are unique to people who buy something. Simply buying a time advantage isn't pay to win, it's pay for convenience. If you can acquire something in f2p, it's not a p2w item.
---
The scrap box is closer to being p2w, except no one really uses THAT much scrap. Well, no one I've ever played with. Still, it's a better example. It's something non-first players simply can't get.
---
How have you made it? probably easy in mom's basement or 3+ roommates all paying the bills.
---
Hey lol I'm at a family thing so was hoping someone else would be able to, but I'll be on later if you still need a hand :)
---
I'd pay for something if it was reasonably priced. We all have our opinions
---
Nope, less for me. I've been playing in 6 to 8 hour stretches tge past few days testing out the private server stuff, haven't crashed once. Used to happen a lot.
---
You're the loser because you think that has anything to do with anything. You cant win an arguement you started so you try to change the subject and get even more mad when I wont let you get past the fact that you are just plain fucking retarded
---
Oh I guess I missed that garbage. That’s funny though, selling the armor of something that’s mocking Americans to people who don’t understand it hahaha
---
The headstone is fairly tall so easy to find, but I didn’t get the meat pile to see if the red is more visible
---
I must say, I like your optimism.
---
I've become beyond doubtful of where this game will be in the next few months, let alone few years.  
---
But I really hope Bethesda sorts itself out (with a bit of help from customers withholding their money I'd suspect), and that this game (and Beth at large) has a bit of a comeupunce. I doubt it, but I really hope it happens.
---
I've noticed this myself, there's a whole lot of people on in the 76 community who clearly have never actually played a game with p2w in it. Paying for time advantages isn't the same thing.
---
Exactly people can’t just be happy that they’re getting something that they’ve asked for since the beginning
---
You started the argument by saying "you suck"...so you are wrong yet again...you broke loser.
---
Bethesda currently has a net worth of only 2.5 billion, and that's after almost a one million dollar investment from Providence, an investment firm.
---
I said ESO was better, so it was a great comparison.
---
I’m not sure what you mean, it seems you’re angry at the lack of interface to private world, which isn’t directly related to fallout first but Bethesda as a whole because they implemented private worlds without actually implementing an actual interface with controls.  As it stands choosing the private server option from the main menu simply loads you into a new world which no one can join except if they on your friends list. If they are on your friends list they can simply join you and the owner can’t do jack unless they unfriend you. 
---
All in all it ~~pretty~~ no bloody shit but I didn’t buy fallout first for private worlds (which are only good for farming lead) but for the cheap atoms and the emotes.
---
May your karma be spared. Lol.
---
That seems very likely.
---
Do you not realize those insults dont work when I'm better at literally everything than you are?
---
Thank you! That’s what I was hoping for!
---
I and many other players got 76 because it was a new Fallout installment, not because it was yet another online game.  Being able to play with my friends was a perk.  I wasn't planning on getting Outer World's, but it intrigued me being an Obsidian game.  Then I got to play for free through Xbox Game Pass (got 3 months with a cpu purchase).  
---
Now I was first introduced to the series in Fallout 3.  Then couldn't believe what a great game New Vegas turned out to be.  Then I got 4 and was happy we got a lot of updates, but fucking despised how they changed the game to focus on crafting.  I wanted story.  76 came out and I could really see Bethesda was switching the franchise to something else.
---
Playing Outer Worlds feels like they picked up from right after New Vegas but with today's graphics, new mechanics, and most importantly a new engine.  For me, I am "switching" at this point.  Not the types of games I play, but the companies I support.  Bethesda no longer cares about us, so I no longer care about them.  It's easy to make money when you're a large game studio and it's not admirable to take a huge shit on the people who got you there.
---
well i figured if they were hosting it it would cost.  not a huge issue for me it works and if i have to pay a little extra to get the "single player" game i wanted (sans a few things but i was more about the exploration then really the quests or main story anyways) then so be it.  and mods soon please lol  turn off hunger/thirst ..enamy respawn times etc
---
(though when mods come seperate saves should be for private servers) not just for not having pay to win BUT to not cause issues like a bunch of crap from a mod server that doesnt exist in live
---
Bethesda has never worked like that. Every game they've ever made has been a buggy mess, but still a wonderous, open world, beautiful buggy mess.
---
Lol I see why it might look like that.
---
Well what I'm saying is that so many of the few left (ie a large chunk of the group who still plays). Hope that makes that clearer :p
---
i like it better then fallout 4 :-p
---
Cool and I could get that too. It's not like I signed a blood pack telling them I'd only play fo76
---
Except making money, having assets, as well as property, oh and money in the bank...more then 100 bucks like your loser pathetic worthless ass.
---
You make it sounds so special, but keep in mind that FO76 is nothing more than Fallout 4 engine with multiplayer literally slapped on. The whole networking layer sits outside the game and communicates with the server and the game. 
---
So in that regard, Fallout 3 was already special and complex.
---
I bet you miss a lot of things up on that imaginary pedestal lol
---
Nope. They need to make money somehow, and since the sister game ESO has a subscription with almost identical perks, everyone should have been prepared to see that crafting storage attached to a subscription.
---
Doesn't offer the same experience am looking for but okay?
---
the unlimited stash should just be for private servers and not live.
---
Oh look at me I'm rich and you can't afford stuff like I do so you whine and I make fun of you
---
Was being sarcastic :). I do agree these 'loyal' fans should have supported the franchise more so that Bethesda wouldn't have to resort to this. Tho I must say devs have some weird taste when it comes to cosmetics and didn't entice me to spend too much money on atoms
---
I’m gonna ask the same question said a million times already.. and I’m aware that this post attempted to answer this question: Win what?
---
That said.. it’s an asshole move to not give the OG’s, the day oners, the true supporters the scrap box functionality after so many QOL complaints about stash box limitations. I agree that that’s insanely not cool. It’s also not pay to win though.
---
Ok, you're just an obnoxious ass.  Time to block you.
---
Then this is for the benefit of other browsers. You can't think of borderlands like a service like 76. It's essentially balanced and designed around being a single player first person diablo shooter with convient hop in hop out peer to peer co-op. As such cheaters are a non issue because it works fine alone and you can control who you let in. Resellers are a non-issue because there is no scarcity the game is rewarding with its loot and your saves are stored locally and can be edited if you want that perfect gun for "convience". Mtx is a non-issue because it's peer to peer you don't need to pay for a lot of sever space beyond what it needed for players to find each other
---
 It's a consumer friendly no bainer model that 76 should have followed at minimum even if they still gutted the rpg elements, and I can imagine only didn't because of the advice of "monetization experts" over actual game designers.
---
no blue screen so far!  but guns are pretty much broken for me lol time for the Axe of death!
---
It was public, I have been informed that it might be the individual server that was going down.
---
Are you still lying to yourself dummy?
---
Pay to win isn't simply about advantages. It's about distinct, unable to be acquired advantages that are unique to the people paying. If you can acquire something without paying, it's not p2w, it's a time advantage. There IS a difference. Play Black Desert Online and try to compete with people who paid for high end pets. Even then, you can usually acquire that stuff with silver but it's a serious effort to do so. Still, it's closer to being p2w than anything being referenced here.
---
Whatever lies you need to tell yourself to make you feel better about this situation, go ahead. You have master's permission.
---
Because you are paying for content that should already be part of the game and is drastically less in quality compared to other games.
---
Just about since launch it's been one middle finger after another at the loyal fanbase. Canvas bags, releasing an incomplete game, not fixing bugs, introducing more bugs, **people losing their gear and inventory with no reprisal**, selling player feedback back to the players and now this..... Over 100 a year for a workaround to their own laziness (junk and scrap), some emotes armor, and private instances. They aren't even real private servers, as soon as the last person logs out it wipes the map.
---
I would think my machine could handle ultra, but I dropped it to very high and the weird crashes stopped happening /shrug. I'm not bitching at all, it's a beautiful game
---
Lol piss poor? More like not mentally challenged.
---
I told you show me what you got, then ill link what I got with a piece of paper with your username on it live as I destroy you mentally and hurt your pride.
---
yes
---
private servers so i can play solo and make it basically a single player game.  enjoying it so far despite some issues. i was smart enough to not put my shit in the scrap of death tho . as a low level player you dont need the unlimited scrap box right away. so hopefully when i do need it they will "fix it"
---
PS4 Pro with less than 2 years of usage.
---
No other game (RDR2, COD WW2, Battlefield 1, VR games, Skyrim SE...) have done these many blue screens EVER.
---
&gt;What SUCCESSFUL online game do you know that doesn’t have one of these a) a form of micro transaction b) a subscription or c) a pay to win aspect
---
Misleading and poorly worded argument. One of these, either a or b, is present in most online games. I won't argue with you there. Games as a service has an upkeep cost and that cost has to be met somehow. The key point here is they are usually centered around cosmetic-only items, like WoW, destiny, or the division.
---
However, option c is usually exclusive to free to play games, and in the overwhelming majority of cases is frowned upon by the playerbase, or seen as an obvious hook for addicts. Look at any gacha game, or for online games most free korean MMOs fit as an example.
---
Fallout 76 is not a free to play game, and neither is it a cheap korean MMO made from a template for easy cash. There is a price tag on the initial game. It also meets ALL 3 of the alternatives you presented. Show me ONE other AAA online game that has options a, b, AND c, on top of a 60-100 dollar price tag on the initial purchase. This is absolutely ludicrous as a business practice. No other game has an initial entry price for the game download, microtransactions, a subsription, AND pay to win aspects in those microtransactions and subscription service.
---
Pete Hines
---
I am certainly missing something here. Boy, I must be really thick.
---
You're own private server???
---
What's a server???
---
It's just a computer, but with loads of connections. But you don't need all those connections if you want to be private.
---
You just use your PC. That is a private server. 
---
So in the time honoured way, you download, or install your game from disc. Then register for updates and voila. You are playing the game on your own private server.
---
As for selecting special friends. What was FO76 open play idea for? Making new friends and playing the game with them.
---
What in all that's holy is the point of having an open world private server.
---
It's just bonkers.
---
the uss constitution
---
I agree with the first point about the private worlds not being private. That was definitely an oversight on someone's part.
---
As for the price point, over seas the price has to include everything. Tax, purchase fees, etc. That's why it seems higher. Here in the states we're only required to show the base rate. For Australians though, I am honestly not sure what happened there. Maybe the Australian Government has an individual tax on video games?
---
Because it was released buggy and in optimized
---
all guns in fallout 76 need to be fixed. currently at lower levels anyways i dont seem to do much damage at all and are pretty unreliable  my fireaxe of death is ready!
---
Dinner first 😘
---
You can say it until you're blue in the face. But the fact is, Bethesda could kill a man in broad daylight on 5th Avenue and this borderline sycophantic crowd would still defend their actions. They could offer up a service that costs literal blood donations to accomplish, and people would line up and give it. 
---
They don't care. They're so deep in the Sunk Cost Fallacy they can't escape.
---
Ok kiddo, have fun in fantasy land
---
Do you have numbers on the cost of "maintenance" for either games? A number on how much Bethesda has made off both games, the "subscriptions", and the microtransactions? Do you have a numbers for the payroll &amp; expenses of the company? 
---
No? So.. like most people, just struggling with some ill-witted fantasy that you heard about from other morons who just regurgitate the same BS over &amp; over again.
---
Real shocker.
---
Bethesda, ES, Fallout, everyone else in connection.. they don't need the extra money to 'keep the game going'. You're just afraid to, or too dumb to, admit that you're a moron. They make a lot of money off stupid people like you.
---
The existence of your post proves it.
---
Show us some factual numbers. Do some basic arithmetic. Use your brain, for possibly the first time ever. Grow a spine. Leave the basement.
---
If you did even a little bit of any of that, you'll probably change your mind.
---
I think Bethesda absolutely deserves it, or else they'll just continue with this crap. In fact, they continue anyway (you'd think they'd have learned something after all the outrage last year!) which means we need to be even more vocal about it. They are apparently dead set on becoming the next EA, so unless you support that kind of video game industry business it's time to put the foot down.
---
Prove you arent worthless...do you even have a grand in your bank account? betcha dont, amd if ya do isnt much more then that, you worthless loser.
---
Sorry, but he's actually right. True p2w is an advantage that a f2p player simply can't get. That's why it's "paying to win". You're paying money for an advantage that a person who doesn't pay can't get. It's no where near as flexible as you're implying, but unfortunately the 76 subs have always had people spreading incorrect information and patting each other on the back with upvotes.
---
Real p2w is easily distinguishable from "paying for time advantage" and what not. It has never been a "loose term". It wouldn't have been called pay to win to begin with if it was. No one saw a time advantage and thought, "Let's call it pay to win!". They saw shit like mobile games where you have to pay currency for extra build slots or special units, and called THAT pay to win because you are literally paying money for an advantage that lets you win.
---
Edit: Black Desert Online is closer to having a bunch of p2w than 76 is. Even then, most of it's not considered p2w by the community because you can still acquire it in game with silver.
---
I always had the idea it was delayed because they just don’t really know what to do with it. 
---
I would like some unique ‘funny’ and handy perks. While I read others want more damage.
---
I can agree with that. Some of the items in the Atom Shop are... fetishist, to say the least.
---
You as well, you in denial mom's basement dwelling broke loser.
---
would be nice if the fucking npc venders didnt  give you just 2 caps for most stuff
---
what the FUCK lol.......greedy robot venders lol
---
Honestly, 100 caps and repairing it is better than building one
---
Daddy is going to let you have your tantrum, ok? Try not to think too hard, we wouldnt want you getting more upset.
---
I could say if you paid anything at all for the game it's your own fault, period. You could have got a sweet sweet USB Microphone on sale at Best Buy with the bundle, I paid $50 for the $120 Blue Yeti Blackout, got the mic and the game. Of course shopping around gets you a deal. Convenience is a powerful motivator though.
---
Oh your daddy ia home? Does he know you are using up all of his and mom's data talking trash to me?
---
Read elsewhere in the thread for your answers and stop being intentionally obtuse for the sake of winning an argument (a.k.a. being an asshole).
---
If they only put the same time on the game as they did with NW. Im not saying NW is perfect but its a lot better done then adventure mode.
---
Edit. 1
---
”It’s a good deal” they say. ”We pay for the fake currancy and get the rest for free!”
---
1. In-Game Currencies
---
The game uses a fake in-game currency that players can redeem. Games use these exchanges to hide the real value of what players may purchase and to make more substantial quantities seem like the “better deal.”
---
Textbook example.
---

---
Says the guy who cant even afford fallout 1st lol scrub
---
It's indirectly related, of course.
---
That's not the requirement though.
---
When I first put all the scrap that was in my stash into the scrap box it was honestly kind of exciting seeing 400lb disappear.
---
Not really out of proportion, but most of the outrage is definitely focusing on the relatively wrong stuff.
---
I've seen very little people besides myself point out that the fact that one can go back and forth between private and adventure with the same character is the biggest problem, and has virtually killed the future of 76's modding.
---
Apart from the further destruction of in game economy by destroying the value of ammo and crafting components (I used to sell flux for 300 caps a piece, now many 1^st CAMPS sell hundreds of flux for 50/70/100 depending on the colour). Image what would happen if premiums were allowed to play with their own rules or conjuring up whatever they want with a cheat terminal-like mod and then being able to run free on public servers and profit.
---
Nobody would have said anything if the two modes required separate characters and the infinite scrap stash was only in the private side. And since at most the private side only hosts like 1/3 of Adventure's players the technical problems excuse would still work. Better yet, everyone would have loved them if they gave the box to everyone.
---
They totally brought this on themselves.
---
Were they not the first to do mtx with the horse armor too
---
Dont hate because my parents actually love me
---
Yeah you're a idiot, I can confirm this, keep spending your money on dirty business practices!
---
Lol...what you got in the bank loser?
---
Well it is blown out of proportion, but not because there is too much hate, but because of people hate it so much that they look at this pretty irrationally, trying to trash it as much as they can.
---
Tbh Fallout 76 deserves all the hate it gets, but people have to see reason and know that there isn't P2W, and there shouldn't be conspiracy theories.
---
People yell about P2W these days but they don't even know what is P2W, like the other day while I was explaining you can buy Prime Access and stuff in Warframe to someone and that someone said it sounded like P2W, pff, plain stupid.
---
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure everyone else would enjoy that too.
---
Here's what Bethesda should have done - make the game FTP and add this subscription. Everyone who paid for the game gets a 3 month sub automatically.
---
As if they would let you in to a bank lol
---
i use the headstone, its nice because its about twice as tall as the brown bag.  the downside is that if you run at it from the side its super skinny and can be missed that way.
---
i didnt go for guts because i feel like it would blend with meat piles to much
---
Mine love me too....yours just feel bad for you, cause you will never amount to shit and there most likely forever...you broke loser.
---
Prequels tend to have an internal story. Fallout 76 doesn't. There is no immediacy or local relevance beyond 'Me, myself and I'. 'I need to stop the Scorchbeasts because if I don't then other people somewhere who may or may not exist but I have no interaction with might die later on'.
---
Even looking at other games I’m rarely going above 100 hours mark, when I can play for 40 hours I will say it was worth my money. I play fo76 for 20-40 hours per month. I lost trust to anything Bethesda and activation is saying, but i will not deny myself of fallout universe that i like just to protest the developer. I’m currently not playing any EA games let’s say I’m protesting there ;)
---
They would if they gave a crap
---
You are talking shit, but not once have you attempted to prove me wrong....and its cause you cant, you broke worthless motherfucker hahaha.
---
You're right, I'm being unfair to ISIS. My apologies to any terrorists that were offended by being compared to Fallout 76.
---
I wouldn't say the game wasn't worth what I paid. 
---
I had fun with it,no regrets. Wouldn't have spent the full price tho.
---
But it is so much better...
---
Theh aren't your parents if they pooped you out under the bridge you crawled out from, you mongoloid troll
---
It’s pointless arguing with these people man. I’ve been told that I’m wrong a knot the artificial stash limit for months even tho I was getting my facts front the creation engine documentation. At this point fucking Todd could announce a robo dildo that fucks players in the ass while in game and some people here would gladly sign up and pay for the shipping.
---
Bethesda has said many times before that sales from the atom shop and other things are what funds the free dlc for everyone else.
---
Nice I dont see too many of those, people are so quick to go the meta route. I always prefer glass cannon melee builds but so bloodied is my go too but I'm switching my build up now to be at least a lil different from the rest like vampires maybe since I dont see too many of those
---
You're just mad because the only wealth you have are the shakedowns from your bridge operation, troll
---
Thanks for sharing your past and upbringing. Hows it feel to be a broke loser in 2019?
---
So them taking payroll tax isn't enough? Them taking property tax isn't enough? Them taking vice tax isn't enough? I should also have to pay a sales tax on everything I buy? They already get nearly 30% of my income off my paycheck in taxes. That's nearly a full third of \*my\* money, I never get. Goes straight to taxes. Then I have to pay property tax. I have to pay a pet tax. Tax on my auto. Petrol tax. Service tax. Food tax. Add it all up, and close to 60% of my income goes to taxes. And I STILL have a tax liability when income tax is due each year.
---
I'm not avoiding any tax. I pay more than enough. Sales tax is absolutely wrong. The government gets enough of my money. 
---
Taxation is theft.
---
ok bye bye
---
Look at all that salt! Man, I really struck a nerve with you didn't I? Did your parents finally figure out where all the charges on their credit card were coming from? That must have been a rough one for you.
---
You want numbers go dig then up. As someone who has helped manage several successful businesses, I can look at the larger picture and see how insolvent FO76 was. You can't expect them to just let the numbers stay negative and keep shifting funds from other divisions into it to keep it alive. That's a recipe for disaster, and would have eventually led to the game being shut down.
---
The existence of my post, a line of thought that goes against the hateful rhetoric being spewed by all of the angry, entitled people that play the game (a small but vocal demographic), shows that I have more spine or brain power than you could ever hope to have. How about instead of reducing yourself to name calling or hate speech, you go ask your mom if she needs any help around the house hmm? Maybe she'll be nice and buy you a month of Fallout First, so you can stop being such a virulent dick.
---
I feel incredibly disrespected that the only super sledge skin is the super mutant one.
---
Yep - just noticed it as well :x
---
One last assumption: you ugly too
---
You have no wealth...do you even have a grand in the bank lol?
---
You are so right, fashion is such a gold mine. But Bethesda just don't utilize it to its full potential.
---
More skins, more and more and more skins, and that will turn to money, more and more and more money.
---
Tbh not all the skin has to be good or very detailed, they can put out very simple skins and people will still buy them.
---
K
---
The tombstone, no doubt, but the pile of flesh one is good all year long. Plus the Tombstone has a generic name on it. I'd have bought it of it displayed character;s names, but sadly that's impossible with the system in use.
---
Personally I'm waiting until Halloween is out so they place non Halloween themed things. I'm hoping for the Vault-Tec lunchbox tbh.
---
The fact that it's missing from the game when it was everywhere in Fallout 4 gives me the suspicion that they always planned to have it a Cosmetic alternative to the paper bag.
---
I don't think so. The things you get in the "premium" service are half-ass, broken or bugged. Losing all your scrap because  of the scrap box really sucks. The private worlds are also bare bones. They only hold 8 players, not modable, no privacy settings, not a  persistent world. On top of that it's overpriced and the reason for that is that they bundled everything up rather than having seperate purchases for each feature and content update.
---
But you ugly doe
---
I still find it an incredible reach. The relation is not only obvious it's basically The Outer Worlds entire sales pitch.
---
You are probably some sweaty greasy motherfucker lol.
---
I think they will change some things since they got all the backlash
---
lol, end game players dont need to buy repair kits since its rewarded when farming queen. Scrap kit is useless since stash is so limited. Theres alot of shit things with this game but p2w is not one.
---
Or you gonna use the alien dildo against someone who bought or duped a tesla?
---
Pretending it sucks so you can feel better about yourself. Sad really.  Taking my wife out for just a basic meal is more expensive than 1 month of sub, even at the 12.99 price, and the sub lasts a whole month, and I feel I get a lot of value.  Too bad you're so cynical and angry at life that you take it out on anyone who shows support of a game instead of jumping on the hate bandwagon.
---
they are too busy with fallout first to give a damn about the servers
---
I actually really enjoy using Vampire weapons, and I've saved a couple nice ones just in case I decide to ever go back.
---
Honestly, it just depends on how weak &amp; pathetic you are. 
---
Do you allow people in your life to walk all over you? Take advantage of you? Lie to you? Treat you like you're an idiot? Make excuses? Lead you on?
---
If so, then you're probably defending this game or trying to rationalize what it is.
---
If you're none of those things, you're probably pissed off.
---
Yes you are haha.
---
It doesn't matter what you call it as long as you know what it means. This is a pointless discussion.
---
I'm cancelling my pre-order
---
Says the actual human troll lol
---
Yeah, I'm noticing that. It's kinda sad because these idiots' decisions can actually influence the game/industry in a negative way.
---
Actually yes in the process of the second time first time around I was a two hander tank but didnt feel natural so switched to my " bloodied plague" build but now I'm switching it to to make it more durable maybe going vampire build but unyeilding is my only choice
---
People are making a big deal out of this.
---
I already forgot and don’t care about it, I’m just not gonna but it. Whoever bought it is in the minority anyway
---
This game is going to be as big as the  Virtual Boy!
---
And what is that experience, exactly?
---
You want a game where you loot and shoot and build with friends?
---
Rust and No Man's Sky are exactly that.
---
If by "experience" you mean a virtually unplayable buggy pay2win mess then yeah, 76 is your game.
---
It's like as if the game doesn't already have a micro-transaction item shop, a pay upfront model with subscription to play online required on console already mandated by console manufacturers.
---
Also a battle royale, a removed survival mode and a few events to me don't exactly amount up to 'infinite free content'.
---
You havent proven you're not a troll so that makes you a troll, by your own logic
---
Says the barely above minimum wage, if even working loser.
---
Not really. True p2w is a notorious thing. Generally drives away all gamers who aren't whales. People still play games that are just "time advantages". 
---
The difference matters. There's enough false information spread on this sub as it is, we don't need more of it.
---
This is fun, now i dont even have to think, I can just beat you using your own words and reasoning
---
Yeah why tf did they release the protectron thing
---
Yeah I do the exact same thing man but only works a few times
---
I wouldn't pay anything for it. I've had fun, yes. But it's been absurdly broken since release. And just supporting Bethesda's scummy business policy... It's beyond me.
---
I called you out first...stop backpeddling, not my fault you dont have or own shit in life.
---
The new quests are easy to start if you go to a camp that has the interactable posters that start the quests (just click on them) - or just look up where to exactly start them.
---
The nukashine quest is always in the same location, but the camera quest is harder to find as you have to find a body in 1 of multiple locations based on your server.  The sheepsquatch main quest can be activated in the ash heap, or from the poster.  The Scout quest can be activated near the big lake east of Grafton, or from a poster.
---
Be careful if your going to do the raid though.  There were multiple reports along with videos of people having their entire inventory cleared after crashing in them.  I cant verify if this was 100% legit, but I haven't don't them since the second week due to this.
---
For respecing, you can use perk points to move one SPECIAL to another.  If your 15 strength and 5 perception, but want to be 5 strength and 15 perception, it would cost you 10 perk points to move the 10 SPECIAL.  And as before you can unlock level 1 to 3 (some 5, some 2), of all cards just by leveling more - so there is no need to restart a new character, unless you want to experience the game fresh.
---
Headstone for visibility 
---
Red shit for concealment against other players
---
Then why defend the obviously indefensible?
---
76 is a broken mess. It is not a grand experiment pushing innovation. There are games that do exactly what 76 does except they actually work.
---
this is just a fact and you either need to accept it or just deal with it.
---
I can agree with that!
---
As awesome as this would be I don't think its gonna happen. They couldn't do it for any other fallout game and as much stuttering and freezing that happens in this game randomly, I don't think the game could handle it. Might be a possibility for private servers if they get mod support.
---
Everything you've said has been a backpedal because you are an actual idiot
---
It’s a premium sub with a few exclusive cosmetic items and convenience get over it.
---
Just like first class in a plane...... box seats at a game, etc 
---
The real problem is the generation of entitlement that you butthurt kids are a part of.
---
It’s sad.
---
I recently got a Explosive Harpoon and Explosive Tesla. And I'm really enjoying using them, especially the harpoon. Lol, so I'll be swapping some perks around also. Just have to level up a few times first
---
I’ve personally spent about 1 hour in public servers since Wednesday, still playing around 4 hours a night on average, and I imagine a lot of other long timers are doing the same. 
---
I didn’t buy repair kits, a fridge or a scrap robot, but I could not give them money fast enough to get away from random stoned, ignorant or otherwise brain dead players. 
---
Playing solo or with a world populated by a few players in a discord chat has been nothing but an improvement vs public servers, so I’ll almost certainly stick with it. I’m guessing most players that prefer the single player experience, IE dedicated Fallout fans, will do the same.
---
Yeah you're not making any kinda message for Bethesda by crusading against a game you don't play lol
---
It is fun, im picturing you eating a cup of noodles borrowing money from mom in your 30's+.
---
Yeah same here I fell you
---
I mean, It's free real estate... bethesda has made quite a shitshow. I can say fallout 76 has been my most favorite game this year cause all the youtube videos dissing fallout have been more entertaining that any actual game.
---
Yes!
---
Definitely. I thought it was a problem with my internet...
---
If that is truly the case then please do not bring up any other fallout game ever whilst discussing 76, lest someone become aware there are better fallout games
---
Yes...you are an idiot.
---
Yeah I read it at several places. But Infact, i was never able to find a new one. Even not the whole week in the enclave command area.
---
We got a Billy badass here WATCHOUT FOLKS!!!
---
Yeah. I try join hunter/hunted but no one joins that anyway
---
I don't think it is right for those to bully someone who bought the subscription. I don't think they are terrible for doing so, it's their money and they can do whatever they want with it. That doesn't mean their decision itself is not stupid, in fact it is a very stupid choice to make overall, paying for a subscription that is barely functional and broken like the game itself.
---
The only people that should be are the heads at Bethesda who has come up with the idea of a $100 dollar subscription and how they released it. Since Bethesda are pretty much becoming the new EA at this point.
---
Ah well, I won a long time ago so I am going to call it here. Thanks for the thumb work out ya doof, your one positive contribution to humanity
---
This.
---
That's a very smart idea. I have a feeling they might do that in the near future without the free part.
---
Yes it’s Bethesda’s fault for being an American company that has a strong dollar compared to the rest of the world.
---
Yeah I'm sure the community backlash had absolutely nothing to do with it.
---
You know what taxes are?
---
... What?
---
I won everybody!
---
They already did. Where have you been? Legendary spawns were buffed pretty significantly. The amount of 2 and 3 star drops now is a bit over the top honestly. They are supposed to be rare and now I’m swimming in them.
---
Yeah I just did too
---
I think a $12 whale is called a porpoise.
---
Reading comprehension isn't your strong suit is it?  I bought a sub.
---
I'm certain I gave a balanced account since I've pissed off people who hate the subscription and like it in equal measure.  You might notice that if you learn to read.
---
Nope I won, cause you were never able to prove you had more then me in real life...thanks again, worthless broke loser.
---
Yay everybody he admitted it! I win!!!!
---
Woo hoo I win I win I win I win
---
No one came out when I was standing there but maybe someone else can give them some love instead
---
I won...proof is here for all to see you never provided proof of anything I asked for..and anyone would have if they had it.
---
Okay, I get that you're upset but how is this pay to win? What exactly are you winning? It's annoying when people throw that term around, it cheapens it.
---
But haven't you heard? It has *16 times* the detail!
---
You do realize that you get 1650 atom each month which is like 15 dollar value.....it’s like a wash.
---
They'd have to include the free atoms too.
---
Lever action is the way to go if non-auto...
---
Some people seem to be having no true others lots. Either way i feel like the ai is being buggy
---
I win...cause you are still here...thought you were leaving haha.
---
Can't scrap weapons and armor etc. at it though, not yet at least.
---
And people at the nuke / event can use it as well, win win if you ask me.
---
Basically, a single person or small group wanted to hit their bonus at the expense of gamers and the franchise.
---
I meta win because you dont even realize how bad you lost
---
You actually have to. You can't put bulk in the scrap box and it won't scrap bulk items.
---
Nope I won...cause you are still here even after you claimed to be done hahaha.
---
Hopefully it's at least a signed JWT... Really no excuse for not encrypting things these days though. Shame, shame.
---
I won here and in real life.
---
How the hell is it 20 hours? I've played like 15 on the weekend and I feel like at least 10 of that was listening to dialogue, and I'm only on the space station after the first planet.
---
Exchange rates are in a state of constant flux. Brexit is right around the corner. There's also VAT to consider.
---
And why would we believe a game ururnalist
---
Dont be a sore loser dude
---
Here's the thing: a lot of fans of the series do in fact have better ideas for how to improve the game than BGS seems to
---
HOWEVER
---
none of those ideas make the board of directors have more dollars in their bank accounts, so they'd never do any of them
---
always remember that the main purpose of any corporation is to make money, anything we get out of that which happens to actually be good *cough*outerworlds*cough* is a rarity for that reason.
---
I use lever and handmade in semi config, they work really well. All the rifleman perks and maxed Perceptions. Fireproof when doing indoor or SB fights.
---
You sound like the most generic boring outrage circlejerker ever.
---
&gt;Outer world's feels like they picked up right after new Vegas but with today's graphics
---
Fucking WHAT lmao those graphics look awful for 2019.
---
&gt;Bethesda no longer cares about us
---
Again, uneducated outrage circlejerking.
---
They made 1 bad game lmfao. From a studio that doesn't make fallout. A side team working on a spin off online fallout game screwed up and suddenly you hate all of Bethesda?
---
Grow the fuck up
---
The majority are definitely not blaming the consumer for the greed of the company. 
---
Stash limit aside, it's not the fault of players that the company is greedy. Whether people bought atoms or not, this is how things were gping to be. Who the fuck are you to blame the consumer?
---
The fuck out of here with your bullshit.
---
Yeah, $100 a year on top of an already base game price, in which the actual base game itself isn't even finished, where the subscription contains features that should have already been in the base game a long time ago, sure do love gimped out paywalled content, tell me more about how much passion the fallout 76 dev team has with pretty much an overwhelming majority of reviews being extremely low.
---
If there were a way of getting reliable numbers i'd honestly wager at least $100 that there's more blizzard devs that play wow classic than there is fo76 devs that play fo76.
---
&gt;WoW's devs are a bunch of psychologists who only knows how to develop addictive game design
---
You mean actually making a good game? Why do you think it's addictive in the first place?
---
Ive been shooting and fighting. Shot 1 with a 10mm for an hour in an open field before a mirelurk queen killed it. It never landed a single time
---
Ai prob gets lost on laggy servers.
---
Who is justifying themselves and for what? Your rant is imprecise.
---
&gt;you can also get what was promised by paying $13 a month for the $60 game you already purchased, plus the Plus/Gold fee to even go online. That's not defensible.
---
It is defensible, if you think games should cost many cents per day. The first $60 was from release until now. The new standard will be with 1st subscribers. 
---
The as they do further development, the standard of work (hours per fun) and play testing will be with 1st. **They will add a paid DLC every 10 months.** They will shut it all down 2 years after the last DLC release.
---
El1te Danger0us? Outer W0rlds of Warcraft Class1c? Sell!
---
You lost bro just admit it so you can move on with your life, everybody else has
---
If you look at it as a mere online survival game, yes there are many alternatives.
---
But Fallout is one of its league and there are actually fans looking at this as an online Fallout game and there is no alternative for that.
---
I have to say the sub is not worth it because the game is in such shitty state, but at face value it is actually quite a deal.
---
I agree! We need more Spooky time stuff!
---
Can you record it?
---
I'll ask you -- wouldn't you rather have those things without paying? Because Bethesda promised everything for FO76 would be free. If people didn't spend money on FO76 (after buying the game) maybe Bethesda would stick to their word.
---
I will consider when they fix fast travel. Now it takes five tries before I could go somewhere
---
I was too for the first few hours until it became so repetitive I missed Preston Garvey.
---
Calmex.

I've seen that the code is all 0's
---
The game is broken already whats wrong with taking advantage of a game that shouldn't have been released until 2022. You aren't supposed to sell legendary items for real money anyways so there is nothing wrong with duping. unlike some people, most don't have the time nor the money to sit on their ass all day grinding and farming to get a two shot dragon or a bloodied whatever. It's losers like you that are ruining all of the good shit this game has going for it. the reason why skyrim and fallout is so popular is because it is 'good enough' they are broken games and the best part of playing them is finding all the bugs and abusing the shit out of em. stop being a killjoy
---
I don't care what your opinion is either. If you're allowed to be a pussy, I should be allowed to be an asshole
---
Imagine actually having convinced yourself that you know what you’re talking about.
---
Give it up man .... majority of this forum is toxic kids that have no concept of what it costs to develop and support a game AND try to make a profit.
---
They want to pay 60 bucks and have free expansions until the end of time.
---
I gladly bought the sub and buy atom each payday because it’s fun and I like to support the game.
---
It’s probably because I work in the software business and know the costs associated.
---
In my experience (yes the butthurt will disagree) the best games that I’ve played are sub based.  You get quality content, support, and you have a voice.
---
Seen the survival tents out in the world, and they're small. Like, same size as the "big" tent you can make normally.
---
I've heard this IPO thing as well, and after some googling, this is the closest thing I can find to any news even remotely implying that's true:
---
https://gamelust.com/news/huge-share-zenimax-media-possibly-for-sale/
---
And it's from 2016   
---
and it's got no convincing mention of an IPO, just a passing "maybe" in there from "anonymous sources"
---
I'm fairly convinced that it's just another angle the people who insisted that Zenimax was only doing what their stock holders wanted to do have decided to play since everyone rightly pointed out that it is privately owned. Granted, there IS a board of directors who seem to be making dumbfuck decisions, but that's not the same as public stockholders.
---
Thought you were done and leaving? You lying loser.
---
Bethesda didn't do much on that one though.
---
You can tell because it's not the same engine /s
---
Im not sure but i think its intresting
---
No one is spreading false information. You just have a different interpretation of the word. That's fine. It doesn't matter. As long as you understand what the other person means when they use the word. Focus on what they are actually *saying* instead of what made up 3-letter acronym they are using.
---
Also, you should have a look at this recent discussion. Specifically the post with most upvotes. https://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/8w417u/what_is_your_definition_for_pay_to_win/
---
Lol. Not going to happen. You people are insane.
---
Thanks. Something to amuse and/or anger everyone. I knew what I was in for.
---
Except ESO is like three times as predatory lol
---
The first thing they need to do is deliver the content this game should have had at launch. Beyond that, I'm happy to pay for good content updates: after all, I previously bought all of the update DLCs (barring horse armor) Bethesda released for their RPGs. But Bethesda have yet to satisfy the first requirement, and have yet to demonstrate that they are capable of delivering worthwhile content to 76 in general—it's all been middling fare to outright crap so far.
---
Yeah somebody already found it apparently the code is 000000 and it’s another vault, but you can’t get passed the next part, probably to do with wastelanders.
---
Great post and a good perspective on this. Thanks.
---
Can't really even see your posts but your blind hate is clear your account is like 30 mins old. 
---
I find something enjoyable you don't and vice versa go figure the world will keep turning
---
Imagine if you bought shoes and but you only got one shoe and it was fundamentally broken and had no soles or laces or tongues and it took the shoemakers months to fix it, but they promised customers nothing they added to the shoes would cost money, just the work to customize your shoes with different details. Then they turned around and added a $100 a year for a SECOND shoe to go with the first shoe so you could have a complete pair of working shoes.
---
Then imagine lying about it and framing it the way you did to make yourself seem smart and call other people stupid.
---
In four or five months the remaining ten people
---
playing this game will have finally moved on to better things.
---
I guess you'll just have to be disappointed then, eh? From what I see better than 2/3 people got it, so I'm guessing that's a rousing success for Bethesda...and a massive failure for all those fascists trying to tell people how they should spend their own money
---
I'm good playing fallout 76, but tell me how it went on Tamriel if you want.
---
If you have a child, or even a niece/nephew, the part where they throw a fit and only get angrier when they realize it’s not working is the funniest part. If a 3 year old can learn a little humility from the process, I can only hope it has the same effect on this bourgeois monstrosity of a community.
---
If you are on PC, tuning down the insane shadow distance in the ini files can significantly increase performance, it is 150000 in High and Ultra settings, 60000 or so in Medium/Low settings and actually all you need is 10000~20000 for normal gameplay.
---
I am using a 6 years old PC that could only run smoothly on low settings and I managed to tune up my texture settings while not affecting performance by meddling the ini files.
---
Edit: They did it because of the mountains, as you can look quite far away from atop mountains, a long shadow distance makes sure your view is nice.
---
Can read your comment, so it may be fine
---
$49 from Amazon AU and 250 hours+ no complaints from this Aussie here
---
Admitting you have a problem is the first step on the path to recovery bro
---
Right and most of the negative reviews are people cirlcejuriking to the negative coverage of youtubers and game urinalists.
---
Don't forget -- Fallout 2 had intelligent, talking Deathclaws.
---
It’s the entrance to vault 79 the keypad code is 000000 iirc
---
&gt;!Vault 79!&lt; was added there with Patch 14. It's hidden behind a secret entrance that needs a code to be opened. They didn't actually code the password since it can be opened with a bunch of 0s.
---
I just hit level 6. Diggin it so far. The SO walks in and says, "is this fallout in space?"
---
$5 a month would have been hell of a lot more reasonable.
---
When the hell would I pay more a month for that than what I would pay for something like Gamepass?
---
Yup it will be the same people saying it now haha
---
Dont forget: you ugly inside and out
---
You just don't understand how it works down under, this is the norm in fact is much smaller than the usual markup. Aussies just seem to suck it up and don't care so the companies just keep doing it.
---
Well sure! But clinging on to something said  unscripted at game conference by some Bethesda guy is akin to believing the drunk guy at a party, really does love "everyone".
---
I am still very excited for Wastelanders. Everything they've presented for it sounds fantastic, and I do like that they're taking their time (maybe?) with it. 
---
It just seemed like we were making headway, right? Like things weren't 24 karat, but they were working on things. Then the FO1st fiasco feels like the launch stumble all over again.
---
Oh I feel terrible for the development teams working on this.  I work in Tech, so I am very familiar with developers being asked to do too much with too little on a daily basis.
---
Regardless of who gets the blame though, it doesn't change the end result: The game has been buggy and/or broken in some way at every turn, and has now reached a point where the paid services being advertised are not even functioning as they are advertised. Whether this is a compete breakdown in communication between the Marketing team and Dev team, symptoms of a shitty engine, or just gross incompetence all-around is irrelevant at this point.
---
Nearly every selling point conveyed to the consumer base before launch has been reversed or just found to be purely untrue or non-existent.  Or, as we're seeing now, monetized.
---
As a person, I feel very sorry for the developers. But as a consumer, it's a sour taste when a game I paid for still has some of the same issues it did at launch, but the Atom Shop has always been beautiful and up to date.
---
As far as ESO and FNV go, at least they both had a robust story and a world full of NPCs at launch. So, not really a good comparison there. And for the record, I played both of those at launch, and neither were as bad or devoid of content as FO76 was/is.
---
And you are just another keyboard hero. And you can't do anything against the fact I own a Scrapbox, other than keeping mumbling unheard vulgarities. So sad.
---
They don't get bad Rep for it because buying plat is entirely optional. You can and I have experienced all the content that game has to offer without spending a dime.
---
Same but I'll come back for a look at wastelanders so long as each conversation with an NPC doesn't cost $2
---
Can't place armour workbences inside backwoods bungalow been trying for over an hour to get it to work it always get the message that it intersects  with an object even if the building is empty if they do get placed they are always on the roof. 
---
Enemies attacking the camp spwaning outside of turret rangeand attacking the camp where the turrets can't defend the camp even when placed at the edge of the build zone.
---
Whitesprings, you have to check the nooks and crannies at times. I usually do a loop around the long chair of buildings, hitting the golf club on the way, then pass through the service entrance area. Doing so gets me usually 1 or 2 legendaries, although if nobody's been by recently I can get up to 7. West-tek I never try, because it's always busy.
---
not logging in ever again, probably
---
Or what?
---
Yup, it's Vault 79, for the Wastlander update...
---
Oh without a doubt, haha. Was mostly making a joke, but it does seem to get some things right, even if it's more or less a WoW clone and this was something...else
---
Data mining showed the two most powerful effects of those additional stars are 'firing an additional bash' and '+33% bashing hit chance'.
---
I believe all legendary effects have equal drop rates on all weapons and armour so finding it won't be too bad. If you do struggle to farm legendaries however, with enough caps, you should be able to find pieces at people's camp vending machines for fairly cheap. Good luck completing your set!
---
Yeah, we don't use USD
---
Lolol you have some issues that stem from your autism obviously. Pussies like you are responsible for colleges having safe spaces.
---
Australians seem to pay a premium on pretty much everything
---
Yep. High percentage. Really glad to see them implement them as legendary spawns.
---
Now, events in the mire and cranberry bog are worth doing
---
Yeah it doesn't let you win at anything. I made an alt and am leveling it with the sub. It really hasn't changed the game but late term inventory management and ability to loot an area freshly without server hopping. Given that is a HUGE convenience and id be more than willing to give up the exclusive right to my junk stash. If i had an active friends list id totally host a server for any 7 people that wanted in.  All i really want from this sub is the atoms, pay towards a server and maybe a combo of free, discounted or exclusive buildables. The tent im on the fence about even being a thing. Its really nice not to have to limit yourself. But making a card for reaching soft cap that allowed travel while overencucumbered would be a fairer way to handle it.
---
If you're not picky about armor type, then it's pretty easy to vending machine hop your way to victory.
---
If you want everything to be Heavy Combat, or Forest Scout, then it will obviously take a lot longer. That being said I think my sniper toon has a full set of Unyielding Heavy Combat in the vending machine (all 1\* variety), though I won't be in game for several hours yet.
---
Congratulations, you googled Bethesda's net worth.  What you should have googled is the difference between Bethesda Softworks and Bethesda Game Studios.  Bethesda Softworks has that kind of money because they're a publisher overseeing at least half a dozen studios with BGS being just one of them.  
---
Unless you'd like BGS to plunder the funds that are directed toward in production games like Starfield and TES VI a game like 76 is supposed to support it's own fucking continued development.  76 isn't like the other games BGS has produced, they aren't just pushing out the base game and then a couple of expansions and then sitting back and raking in a profit.  It costs money to keep developing regular patches and content for live service games.
---
Yep I think this is the answer too.  So is it Bethesda or Amazon taking the piss?
---
Dude, look at the history of every MMO. Merging servers, delaying content and going p2w are major hints.
---
I get unyielding pieces frequently, it just depends if you want it to be a matching set (all scout or marine etc..)
---
and if you want all 3* pieces with complimenting stats etc..
---
Depends. If you want specific stats it can take a while. To get the unyielding effect on a piece isn't too hard to come by. Look into player vendors also. There's always someone selling them
---
Does Bethesda ever listen to the fans? It’s like their trying to destroy Fallout!
---
No community manager would be insane enough to say a word with the all the trolls out and about, noticed quite a few non fallout 76 players suddenly posting on this sub to whore out for karma and they aren't above threatening a community manager to get that +20 karma.
---
Well Captain Marvel isn't there for you this time, Fury.
---
That tuber is click greedy.
---
Same Answer
---
Overdosing on jet, which I wouldn't be surprised to see in future updates
---
I'd even add, it's kind of like Fallout, Mass Effect, Borderlands, and Firefly got put in a blender in various ratios and this is what came out. Maybe a dash of Bioshock here and there for flavor. It's fun!
---
Plot twist, private servers are their new "instance technology" /s
---
It's very easy if you are looking for 1 stars because everyone is selling.
---
That does excuse shitty behavior. If you bought 1st you’re an idiot and deserve to be called an idiot.
---
Yeah I have a bad memory of finding the body’s but I don’t think any of the quest items spawned just the tattered dress apparel.
---
Did you try with bulked junk also? I had a weird thing where I was bulking plastic to put into my vending machine. I crafted 10, went to put them in the vendor and it said I only had 8. So then I went back and crafted some more bulk plastic, only it was using the bulked plastic to bulk more plastic? Weird, but only happened once.
---
Elder Scrolls Online.
---
Another Bethesda game that absolutely trounces Fo76 in terms of players per server and object interactivity.
---
Something that you should be able to host locally off your own machine for free? And here you are paying through the nose to still be on Bethesda's shit servers.
---
Wait what’s this legendary player system? The r are you joking, I’ve never heard of that before
---
Not too bad about 2k-5k per piece (standard) 10k for a nice ☆☆☆piece eg with reduced weapon weight perk. And 25k+ for a uny cav/sent piece.
---
Wait i thought we could only get up to 3 star
---
Well, the public servers have been packed and I'd guess at least 2/3 of those have bought a sub based upon scrap bins, armor and emotes seen, so I'm guessing Bethesda is counting that a major success.  The simple fact that they're selling annual subs, and most are buying it that way, they intend to keep it running at least another year+.
---
I'm not a fanboy or a hater.  Just a curious bystander.  I played for a minute back at the beginning but the game was so boring and buggy I havent played since.  
---
But back in the day when this was coming out, they said "no paid DLC, all free future content."  Isnt this a boldface lie?  Wouldnt this fall under some type of consumer protection?  Just curious.
---
Just as well there's only 25 million of them.  That's where 'net effect' and 'per capita' diverge.
---
Do us all a favor and hang yourself
---
Sure but are there no taxes in the USA?
---
Free Hong Kong
---
Ill pay it so that I can play alone. How is that pay to win? I thought p2w applied only on pvp...
---
They're all "worse" in different ways. Activision for adding in loot boxes and such to games like Crash after promising no MTX (sounds a bit familiar, doesn't it) and laying off employees after "best profits evar!", EA for dropping games and shuttering studios rather than stopping to fix them. Ubi for adding in the grind and then selling us XP boosters, and going full PTW with Breakpoint (perfect title, too!) ..and so on it goes
---
I only consider a game like this pay to win if you can pay for items/stats to make your character more powerful. I've played actual pay to win games where people shell out money to be much stronger than others and it sucks. At no point has this game been pay to win in my opinion.
---
Huh
---
You're right. The membership is a bad idea, however you look at it. But the timing for the announcement was the worst. I was thinking of coming back for wastelanders (havent played for like 5/6 months), can't really say i will now...
---
Thats what I like about it, compared to something like Borderlands which cracks jokes every 5 seconds. The writing in this game has a more satirical and realistic edge with enough dry humor for levity. For example, while Captain Hawthorne dying is played as a one off gag, as the story progresses you start to see the impact he had on the people of the colonies.
---
Thats their job.  Your point?
---
He certainly speaks for a large majority of us. I like Fallout 76, but the subscription was the last nail in the coffin for me, at least until Wastelanders comes out.
---
I fault the morons who continue opening their wallets for Todd.
---
Private worlds are a huge performance upgrade I'd say. Looking forward to trying it out
---
Welcome back! System?
---
What is there to praise?
---
tHe OuTerWorLds
---
The only other countries that use the $ to my knowledge is New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Australia. Of that, only in HKD is $190 not significant.
---
It's going to be vault 79 is what the speculation is. Someone posted a video on YouTube about it
---
Thank you! You have been incredibly helpful! ;)
---
In between trying to decide what the game *was* they decided what the game wasn't; and that was a PvP game.
---
Sorry mate. Your preferred mode of play was made obsolete by Bethesda. 
---
My guess is they couldn't work out a way to over-monetise it so they ditched it.
---
That’s quite the set you have there! Thank you for your help
---
I guess for now it's not widely known, but with time we'll see more threads like this.  
---
I submitted a ticket, it again happened a thrid time today on a friend's.
---
https://youtu.be/WGxN2lS6huc
---
I’m not too overly bothered as this is my first proper build, all im really concerned is the unyielding part
---
It is not the same subscription.
---
That's a lot of hostility man
---
Dont forget...you are broke and probably will never get past penny to penny living.
---
Nope I personally don't usually post. Aten_ra, gilpo, sergeant_mqz, rynlnk are generally the ones who post things
---
The irony here is beautiful.
---
I agree. What people fail to see is the absolutley enormous potential this game has to be something very epic. Plus when you read a lot of haters comments many of them day they quite playing after 2 weeks or never bought they game. 76 biggest critics are a bunch of people who don't even play the game
---
To be fair most of the people I've seen on these posts recently don't care about Fallout 76 and instead coming here to farm karma like a whore since its the cool thing to hate on Fallout 76, currently we have dlc coming compared to Anthem which doesn't. I hate Bethesda and Zenimax.
---
Super edgy, definitely doesn’t have an anime girlfriend pillow.
---
I challenge you to find a game that can actually run well.
---
No I am saying that anyone touting atoms being a good thing is a shill
---
Agreed
---
Over a subjective video game?
---
Umm bethesda doesent have anything to do with ESO besides the Trademark. ZOS created ESO any ESO nerd can tell you the same thing.
---
How quaint
---
*scrolls through comments waiting for the shills*
---
my man. You giving me hope that reason and logic will prevail, but you are right. Hard to swallow pills.
---
Except moving the tent has no cooldown, nor caps cost. So if you hit the weight limit, you can summon it, drop all your junk off, and then continue.
---
Without the tent, you either have to drop stuff until you're underweight, take chems/food, or move your camp for a caps cost, which will also break it down into blueprints so you have to place down everything again.  
---
I will agree it's not really pay to win, but it is extremely pay to convenience
---
Iv paid more then $60 for games that iv spent far less time in, so honestly id say iv gotten more then my moneys worth
---
Boo
---
Nice. It's it explosive by chance?
---
I bought the game for 35 u.s. dollars in week 2 of release.
---
All I can say is please uninstall and move on with your life. No one is forcing you to stay. Boycott the Bethesda brand, boycott video games, take up an outdoor hobby. I may have went too mentioning the outdoors, but you get the point.
---
Oh yea nice both beast and beast weapon
---
Not sure about all the love posted here.
---
I walked the whole map w/o a tent.  Did it a couple times.  There are so many cap stashes to find that any need to fast travel was always easy to pay for by simply exploring.
---
The tent isn't a necessity.  It is a paid for benefit however .... as you make very clear.   ... $100.00 real dollars for an imaginary tent?  You lost me about it's real value, beyond item for wealthy players with more money than wits.
---
I can't view or interact with comments, but I heard other subreddits are having the same issue.
---
I think anything they say right now would be received poorly. Action could help, but it would have to be something as drastic as the uproar, which isn't like to happen.
---
Plus we have no idea how much hate mail the CMs are getting right now. Some people are ill...
---
Best thing Bethesda can do now (from my point of view of course) is lay off monetization for awhile, upgrade those private servers ASAP, and make something fun to tide people over until Wastelanders. When a game is polished and/or well supported people tend to be a lot more forgiving of missteps.
---
I agree with OP but disagree with most people that post on this sub.
---
Reason is: A) I think Fallout 1st is absolutely pay to win. But B) that it's the first genuine pay to win available. I know this sub, so I'll have to defend that.
---
A) Forgetting the extra details OP has (I don't have Fallout 1st), my build is based on carry weight. So is my armour. Everything deep pocketed. Everything weapons or something weight reducing. Most of my weapons are 90% weight reduced for their third effect.
---
I could get better weapons, armour and better legendary perks for fighting if I didn't have to be so careful. Hello cavalier and sentinel! God damn I'd be trouble if I wasn't restricted so badly.
---
Its pay to win.
---
B) Scrap bot yada yada. I have the scrap bot from my free atoms. I didn't pay to win and I'm bored of people saying that I did. Repair kits? I regularly discard the free ones when I'm over encumbered and realise I somehow have 18 of them. And the free ones are better than the ones you can buy! Still worse than a workbench though.
---
Fact remains: I still have a few thousand free atoms even after getting the Halloween bundle. I didn't pay to fucking win. I did it for free. That's not pay to win.
---
Tldr; Fallout first is pay to win. Atom shop isn't.
---
Oh and before I forget, you know what really hurts? They've basically admitted we could all have unlimited junk storage but won't give it to us.
---
So do they help you guys out or what?
---
Nah, but it's nasty nonetheless. 90% reduced weight, +25% fire rate. I call it Vlad.
---
Fo4 was the first fallout where junk actually becomes usefull and makes sense but 76 really perfected the junk/resources and crafting. When i first got Fo4 i thought the building aspect was dumb, never did it until i beat the game. Then i sunk hours into building cool settlements. Now in 76 building a cool storefront/base/house is fun and i love stumbling onto other players bases.
---
For telling an obvious fact? Nah.
---
Interesting situation with me, I replied to you, you can see my reply, but my posts are not showing up anywhere else. I'm wondering if I fucked up somehow and got shadowbanned?
---
$13, and do you really think a lot of those who got that wretched subscription only stopped at that? I doubt it.
---
The three people they have working on the game are probably too busy copying skins from FO4 for the Atom Shop.
---
I think it would be better for the game if they actually followed through with their threats and quit.
---
You are 100% wrong but that's ok. I'm assuming that because of the way you write (short on substance, long on words) you have lost track of the conversation. 
---
You know... you make some really good points here. I have to admit. I fully understand the appeal of private servers. I think they are just a little pricey.  I would pay five bucks a month for private servers. 
---
But it all goes back to the same problem: stuff being overpriced.  I'd spend more money in the atomic shop if the stuff wasn't so damn expensive.
---
Hating is caring too. In its own way. And when was it not cool to hate on Fallout 76? Hating on awful things is always cool. That's why games about killing Nazis never go out of style.
---
Check out gamerMOMover50 she did a video on youtube mightbe vault 79
---
That’s... that’s what you’re going with? Disregarding a decades-old, **universally accepted** English term? 
---
[Here](https://www.thoughtco.com/slippery-slope-logical-fallacy-1692105) you go. Hopefully this can explain it a little more for you. No one is saying that things can’t lead to other things, but simply using one event to justify a worse, much larger event *without giving real arguments or proof as to why* makes it a fallacy. Like saying “allowing gay marriage will just lead to the acceptance of polygamy and beastiality so we shouldn’t allow it”... there’s no proof or argumentation there, just pure speculation. Hope this helps.
---
It took quite a while, hours of looking at 76Market and a lot of caps.
---
Well worth though 👍🏻
---
I also would recommend that you use one Bolstering pieces, that helps out with damage resistance at low health. 
---
Don't forget about Radicool perk too, that boosts your strength when at high rads.
---
No one gives a fuck that you drink windex
---
Anyway you can pretend to be in the US?
---
Outer worlds is decent but honestly it's no fallout in my opinion. The small world's are a bit under whelming and the graphics aren't  anywhere near as good. It's a fun single player game but it's not perfect.
---
Another one I could have added on my list 👍
---
I agree, but theres also a fine line with advantage and convenience, for example being able to pay money to level a character to max as long as your main hit max is actually makes sense, some people dont have the time to do alot of grinding and etc but want to try out a new play style, but in cases like the tent and scrap box, yikes.
---
Far out that's incredible! I'm still amazed that the recipes for serums are so expensive but people can't sell them for more than a few hundred caps at most.
---
No and no
---
Fallout76 bad
---
Use chems that reduce charisma and agi/perception cause ur a heavy gunner. Charisma doesnt do much other than make things cheaper when u sell. 
---
Im a heavy gunner as well.
---
It honestly kind of makes me hate the game now. I still have no idea what i even got for my extra 30$ buying the upper tier version of it at launch. Now it just feels like an insult. Private server? THAT'S where they put their time &amp; effort? Seriously? Not one single story addition... but this?
---
I completely agree!
---
Agreed price needs to be lower, heck only give me 500 of atoms and charge me $5.
---
Even if they never change the actual map, with npc's coming to the game they can add or subtract locations in the map. Add dialogue and quests for npc that would keep this game feeling fresh and unbeatable for years.
---
Just tried, bulk steel in vending machine was not used when crafting a hunting rifle. My pockets were empty.
---
Outer worlds is good. Quit being a hater
---
Can we have this instead of lewd her?
---
I did that one too but I couldn’t figure out if I competed it yet
---
Fallout first subscribers have an icon next to their name online.
---
The thing here is you’ve stopped putting the blame on Bethesda. Now you’re just attacking other players because you don’t agree with something they want.
---
If you don’t want a private instance and some recon gear, then this doesn’t affect you at all. Who cares if other people get enjoyment from being alone? I thought the biggest gripe about the game when it came out was the multiplayer was gonna ruin the “solitary experience” of the Fallout games. 
---
Now Bethesda gives people the option to be more solitary, and you attack other players for it? Let them have their fun however they derive it. You don’t have to pay a cent... and you don’t lose or gain anything from this... and it actually takes the people you don’t like away from you ever seeing them...
---
So why do you still attack people for their preferences?
---
Come with me if you want to live...
---
Maybe war does change
---
so it doesn't need vault steel to repair and if i paint it i can still use the effect? why do people say these things?
---
No. Everything is okay
---
But, if everyone becomes a FO1st member, then equality will return. 
---
Video games like FO76 that are being continuously updated and that have the ability to be played infinitely, cannot be compared to finite gameplay. I paid $60 for Zelda: Breath of the Wild. I played for about 100 hours. With FO76, I may be near 1000 hours played. These two games cost the same, yet I received around 900 more hours of game time from FO76. I love that I’ve gotten a free 900 hours of game time, but I realize this is not equal. 
---
With games that allow for infinite play, like FO76, a model like Netflix (or any streaming service) makes a lot of sense. If FO1st is just the beginning and Bethesda plans to build this subscription into an all inclusive Fallout streaming service, then I feel that this is going to be a bright and wonderful future. 
---
Bethesda has to remain profitable. Bethesda must answer to its investors. This is simply the way of our market. I feel like most are reacting very immaturely about the changing progression of video games. This isn’t NES anymore. Like how the industrial revolution cause mass upset by the people, yet it vastly improved quality of life, I feel Bethesda’s subscription platform is doing the same. We are just in the infancy of this evolution. 
---
I believe that your anger and frustration is rooted in ignorance. Try to be open minded to where this will take us. If Bethesda continues to profit, we will see improvements in their games. If we don’t see improvements, then another studio will rise up and take their customers away. This is how our market works. 
---
If the mob mentality crushes Bethesda now, everyone loses. Bethesda goes out of business, and we lose their game franchises. That would be unfortunate.
---
Plus they have to flip everything upside down.
---
Interesting thing is for the price of a fallout first membership you can buy a real tent.
---
I hear a Liberator.
---
Dude, if that many people speak about something, then it probably has a bit of truth in it. Don’t you think?
---
It's an online game.
---
It comes with a myriad of subscriptions necessary.  They may not be paid directly to Bethesda, and that is why Bethesda has added their own .... they want in on that action.
---
I would far rather pay for DLC, as a ONE time for always fee.  I paid FULL pre-release price, as many others did, which was 4 to 5 times as much as most players paid only one month after release, while waiting 6 months for just the basic game play to normalize and be worth the POST-MARKET price of $25 or free with a controller FO76 sold for by Dec of last year.
---
I never wanted my money back because the promise was to keep it FREE ..... then this.
---
Bethesda deserves ALL the criticism and fan hatred they are currently receiving, and a long stint of losing money, and being forced to get honest or get out of the game.
---
Nope, games not installed anymore.
---
I agree the scrap box and tent should be made for everyone.
---
Funny enough, I didn't know it would "scrap and store" till just today. I was using the Save Everything mod and it breaks the prompt on the scrap box so you can only place already scrapped components in one piece at a time lol.
---
 I don't really care if the rest is pay to win though. I still nuke on public servers half the time, and usually it's not on prime. I just enjoy nuking oddball places so other people can check them out. When i nuke on the private server it's usually prime so i can collect flux components.
---
!remindme 3 months
---
Because games then become designed for people that pay instead of being made just to be great for everyone.
---
Wait. What?
---
To make it more challenging
---
 Dude i keep about 200 of each item in my storage. I went down to like  180lbs  which was basically all store items and clothing. I dropped 600  lbs and the other 20 was empty just so i could keep doing brewing  dailies/junk overflow gap. Im big on building and like to keep a bulk  stock for workshop town making. This free weight has had me mass stock  cooking items because i always wanted to make the harder dishes but  didn't want to deal with the mess. Also now i can keep hundreds of drugs  to sell though i see the market tanking a bit with people playing  privately and having the ability to mass stock themselves.  Even bullets  can now sit in 10k's just incase i ever decide to play with a gatling  for a day. It completely changes how you play the late game.

"we hear you and we added 5 stars to the atom shop now" -bethesda
---
Personally, I also feel it was insult to injury that they specifically chose Nuke Day to, well... Essentially nuke what last scraps of hope we may have had. Thanks, Bethesda.
---
Try crafting and throwing explosive bait.
---
Maybe I haven't noticed because I spend most of my time exploring, the only times I mess with inventory management is when my stash is full. Then I bulk things, sell them, and go back to exploring. It takes barely five minutes to do that. The question wasn't stupid, stupid is assuming everyone plays the game the same way as you.
---
Wait for the sign. Then all prisoners will be released!
---
Actually it was supposed to come at summer but got delayed, twice.
---
This is both hilarious and pathetic.
---
Did you miss the bit where Bethesda charged £100 for a subscription that doesn't work? 🤔
---
I'd consider 3D movement and interaction certainly relevant.
---
Right
---
Oh my
---
They've already been going down that road with repair kits and whatnot. It's not the first instance of them implementing P2W mechanics, its just the most egregious. Regardless, implementing it with the method I mentioned would have gone over with less turbulence. Still a backlash, but you would have many more defenders of it than you do now, and probably would have avoided the PR shitshow they conjured for themselves.
---
And Naughty Dog.
---
The key I feel is focus on a singular vision and not genericism.
---
lore is established thru a terminal that the air system shut down like 24hrs after it opened meaning we con no longer breathe inside the vault.
---
Right, I'm talking about a manual approach I use which is frustrating &amp; imperfect, but does significantly help ;)
---
You caught the actor on a cigarette break.
---
Yeah the logic supports it but that’s not enough proof. That logic could also support selling prefab C.A.M.Ps on the store, or a host of other things, so why pick out one possible idea? 
---
This is a textbook slippery slope fallacy. No one is asking about “have they mentioned it before?”, “are there plans to do it?”, or “are there other, more specific choices they’ve made that point to this being the case?”
---
Because I think the whole idea of the Purveyor puts this selling weapons idea dead in the water. Why give a way to get a guaranteed legendary item like that? They could have just released it then and no one would have ever had the idea of a Purveyor in their mind. Now, I think most of the player-base would rather grind for scrip than spend any amount of money on a gun. I don’t think the return on investment would be as big as many think, since there’s a FREE way to do it.
---
Nice try, Todd.
---
And you will cry when that happens? You seem to care too much.
---
If you enjoy the game, then do so. Other people quitting doesn't affect you. Yet.
---
That's lame
---
&gt;many many things that they did good with 76
---
...
---
I'm confused, where did I say I was trying to make a message to Bethesda? I'm simply explaining the logic of others.
---
That doesn't make someone a moron. People who purchase content in 76 know what they're doing, and are likely neutral on the situation (which is ok).
---
$100+ original pre-order cost.
---
$100+ subscription added.
---
$200 is the most expensive video game ever released (by double) ..... and that gets you just ONE year.
---
That ain't "low"  .... that's ludicrous.
---
It's a few quests that keep leading to another one. And I guess eventually to the Sheepsqautch.
---
You all should realize that Zenimax and investors pulled the strings here. You know games income from DLCs are always degrading over time, a subscription is typically more stable income then sudden spikes from major DLC content. That being said Fallout 1st in all likely hood was going to drop with the DLC. Bethesda having to delay that obviously couldn't delay the subscription service, I am guessing promises or investor agreements. 
---
Bethesda is by no means innocent, however All of us are to blame by financially supporting games that release buggy from all developers. We have become complacent in it. We should be targeting Zenimax more than Bethesda.
---
Why you are writing like that, as though you're making a title? Is That You Jaden Smith?
---
Also, a subscription is generally fine, but not when some people have paid upwards of 200 quid on this fucking "game".
---
They don’t, those are the wrong points to argue. Private worlds give the player resources (loot, XP, legendaries, bobbleheads, magazines, chems) that be used to create a stronger build which can be used to dominate other players in adventure. For example, every bobblehead on a private server is yours, no competition. Same for whitespring, all the legendaries after a nuke are yours. Now, you take this build and play adventure, one shot everything, take every workshop, kill everybody that tries to stop you. Are private servers needed, no, but they make it easier and quicker to accomplish. Do they make it impossible for others not to get loot and XP, no, but it makes it harder. Pay-to dominate is a better term. Make sense?
---
eat the rich
---
I think he is a beautiful person.
---
Thank you.
---
Yeah that's how i feel about it as well (too many subscriptions to things). If i was confident the game was going to get sufficient content updates going forward (and that wastelanders isn't going to flop) I'd not really mind the $8/mo the yearly comes out to, but I'm not buying a yearly sub to this game right now. The $13/mo is too steep IMO other than to try it out for a month or two. I'll probably let my subscription lapse after one month unless they have some other content between now and wastelanders.
---
12$ it's only 100 for the year and you keep all of the 1 time rewards for signing up at all.
---
I just wish they separated it, I would like a private server and not all of the unbalancing. I liked the scrap limit made the game more fun to survive in and they skip around the 'its not p2w' because the box and tent have no combat advantages but that doesn't mean they don't give people advantages in game.
---
The game hasn’t changed for them, it’s literally will be the exact same game play for them. Nothing is taken away from what they had a week ago.
---
Not really hard to have the full basic set with Vendors and events.
---
But much more harder if you want optimize it with the others effects.
---
**WOW.**
---
This really was a patched with duct tape overhaul of Fallout 4, wasn't it?
---
You'd need a story for it to be spoiled.
---
then what are you doing in this subreddit?
---
Check the vendors, do the sbq, there's enough around of this type.of legendary armor
---
True True.
---
Pick up all three levels of all three rifleman perks along with tank killer.
---
Quality of life cards include:
---
concentrated fire (for vats if desired), 
---
Tormentor ( for grounding SB's) 
---
Action boy/girl (quicker AP,  refresh for vats)
---
This is the damage part of my build it takes up 19 points (I only run one rank of concentrated fire) I fill in the rest with quality of life perks when needed (good doggy, weapomsmith etc
---
...and I would probably still have to press R to reload 4-5 times to actually get ammo into the gun except....I deleted the f\*cking shame I mean game instead.
---
Good bot
---
I bet you'll need the fallout first description in order to play the wastelanders expansion.
---
Its like voting. You'd think 1 vote doesn't really matter, but it does.
---
wait what
---
At this rate there won't be anyone around for it to be delivered to.
---
Its not because ESO first got better, then it charged more not the other way arround.
---
No, it takes a couple minutes for new spawns
---
what?
---
Is that why everything has "5 comments" then I open it and it says theres no comments? I thought it was on my end.
---
If your on PS4 I can craft you a handmade, it's great for starting and the ammo is cheap and easy to make
---
It’s sad that people are that fucked up enough in their heads that there’s even a shred of a chance that they would say these things ever
---
Exploration is exactly why I play the game. Combat is incidental. I just listed all those combat aspects because they're the only thing that could fit in the category of 'pay-to-win'. Being able to collect more scrap just doesn't qualify as a pay-to-win aspect to me. The PVE aspect of the game isn't competitive so there is no 'Win'. There are just people who have completed the storylines and people who haven't. why should you or anyone else care if people have unlimited scrap storage? how does it affect you in any way other than getting your panties in a wad?
---
I'm one of those that was going to give it a chance. Now, I don't see myself giving Bethesda any money for anything.
---
Its Vault 79 and that is for Wastelanders, the code is 000000 if you want a look inside.
---
Games cost about the same...
---
Both have unlimited scrap carrying
---
Both give you in game money to use, Fallout Atoms and ESO crowns which both allow you to. It items from in game store. 
---
ESO give you DLC’s which normally have to be purchased but ESO doesn’t give you a server to yourself... fallout will give you upgrades at no cost but you get a server to yourself. 
---
I could list out numerous other similarities but bottom line is that they are very similar just a different game.
---
I think it’s a shitty product, with a shitty message. The message being “we still haven’t fixed our core game, so we’ve worked on this instead to make more money so you can pay us to keep fixing it for another 12 months”.  It’s lazy. And I think there’s some really stupid, obnoxious people on here who like to argue for the sake of it. The amount of people I’ve seen who think that the only reason people don’t like it is because they cant afford it, is extraordinary.
---
I use refined .50 but eather way .50 is the way to go as u can create 100 ammo per at tinkers vs a small amount of ammo.
---
&gt;facilitates prioritizing profits over customers or even human rights.
---
Wow...so Bethesda is responsible for China and North Korea putting people into camps? Who knew!??
---
&gt;the system that allows these huge corporations to exist and exploit their workers
---
I know, right? Preach it comrade! How dare Bethesda create a couple thousand high paying, white collar,  tech jobs! Why those very same oppressed workers are going to have to give up nearly 40% of their salary in taxes to a government that doesn't even see them as human...and that is Bethesda's fault too!
---
Good job paying for services that should be already included in the game, and are included in games that cost a lot less upfront, not to mention those games produce miles better services. Not to mention its false advertisement when saying "private servers" because its a private instance, you don't get your own server that persists when you log out. You get an instance of the world that is wiped clean between log ins.
---
&gt;Too bad you're so cynical and angry at life that you take it out on anyone who shows support of a game instead of jumping on the hate bandwagon.
---
Man I love it when people know more about me than I do, I didn't know I was angry at life! You are showing support to a company that has made it very clear they no longer care about creating actual quality content, as long as you guys keep forking it over, they are going to keep rolling out bullcrap.
---
Bethesda: Oh, did you think we meant convenience for the player? No, no, no we meant that it is convenient for our wallets.
---
Advantage over who? The scrap box is only available in PVE which isn't competitive.
---
It's a $15 game. If it was a $60 game a lot more people would agree they don't need monetization to support the game.
---
We broke Reddit!
---
Didn't say it wasn't good lmao
---
Said it was bland. Nothing special
---
Essentially the same just slightly different but if you put them side by side both have more similarities than differences. It’s the same model but slight changes to work with said game.
---
I believe that they need additional revenue, potentially related to the upcoming expansion. Hiring 8 developers for a single year would cost around a million dollars in my city... or more. 
---
If the people in this sub were to research alternative strategies for monetization &amp; prove that they were viable by using data that showed that hundreds / thousands of players would make purchases via some other system, I think that would go a lot farther than "this sucks and we hate you" ;P
---
Hey man, if you wanna join a subreddit where they players are simply happy to play the game, hit up r/fo76filthycasuals. It’s a great place where you don’t have to deal with someone calling you “a whale’s bitch” just because you play a game how you want. 
---
If you already knew/are subbed, then anyone else who sees this is also invited. This is a video game, and games are supposed to be fun!
---
Exactly!
---
Yup, same for your neighbours in the north. I guess whole Europe got that price.
---
I have all three.... The argument being that even if you used atoms that you earned people had issues with it as numerous posts and comments we have all seen here in this subreddit.
---
I don’t hate it even downvote comments... people don’t know what downvoting is or how to use it on Reddit. Instead they think it’s a “I don’t agree with what they’re saying” it’s not designed that way.
---
I don't know what that means. Did you play it once and hate it?
---
For fluctuations to take effect, the Australian dollar would have to climb above 0.83 USD. That's laughably high in this current era.

Nah, it's not just to cover fluctuations. It's an actual ripoff.

i think u might have, dont know how it works. But i can reply you directly from browser, but if i context load your comment it takes me to the top of OPs post and not to your comment. Cant reply u on phone either

You sure seem pretty hell-bent on strawmanning. 
---
&gt;&gt;facilitates prioritizing profits over customers or even human rights.
---
&gt;Wow...so Bethesda is responsible for China and North Korea putting people into camps? Who knew!??
---
Wow it's almost like I didn't say that. 
---
&gt;&gt;the system that allows these huge corporations to exist and exploit their workers
---
&gt;I know, right? Preach it comrade! How dare Bethesda create a couple thousand high paying, white collar,  tech jobs!
---
*Bethesda or Zenimax* didn't do any of that, the founders of the company did that. The board of directors at Zenimax exploits their employees in order to increase their profits. 
---
&gt;Why those very same oppressed workers are going to have to give up nearly 40% of their salary in taxes to a government that doesn't even see them as human...and that is Bethesda's fault too!
---
Another strawman. I agree, the government sucks. Anarchy when, comrade?
---
It's tough for me to understand why it's so important to avoid doing unnecessary things which might make someone else feel happier. I don't have to open the door for a stranger when they walk up, but what do I get out of refusing to be kind? Why is it ideal to strive for making the least effort possible?  ;)
---
Best bet, check player vendors, you can sometimes find a good deal. I decided to get a Unyielding set and took like 2 days to get a decent set, some 3 stars some 2 stars. Nothing god tier but enough to try a basic bloody build with a few bloodied weapons I found.  
---
Another is to script everything and hit up the legendary vendor when you can.
---
Yes I would also like to explore vault 76
---
both are false, SH uses ultricite repair costs, and paint is cosmetic only
---
Who? I've not seen their vids lol
---
Considering heavy guns is completely useless to at least level 25 I kind of get it with some of them.
---
Bethesda’s turning 76 into the plot for Joker
---
I don't know about the former because I use the repair kits I get from Her Majesty to repair it however regarding the latter... nope.
---
Mine has the Black Rider 'skin' and works just fine.
---
Ey just skipping the purposely implemented inconveniences right? No biggie, poor Bethesda hardly has a choice, surely they couldn't actually make a better game and fix the issues through patching the actual game.
---
why do people say that then?

---
I read that a few times in posts about the subscription... not making that up at all... anyone can see that by the posters own words! 
---
If you don’t even play the game or you installed it sorry but your opinion then is just that... an opinion and those who love the game and enjoy it and even bought the subscription get blasted and trashed or downvoted because someone has a different opinion than them.
---
Now available for the new Fallout Overseer premium membership, $15/month to allow legendary items have a max star level of 5 instead of 3 for regular players
---
50 cal mod got fixed
---
I don't know about KotOR, but with New Vegas they didn't get a bonus at the end of its rushed development because it was one point shy of an 85 critic rating.
---
eh just wait until tuesday, then we will be at a ton of "when event start"  and many event related posts
---
I've had a piece of razorgrain in the scrap box since I made my previous comment as a test. I'm watching football right now but once the game is over I'll go back in and see if it's spoiled. I've already played hours with it sitting there but I haven't checked to see if it's spoiled or not, even if it were in a fridge it should have spoiled by now. I'll come back here once I go back in game and see.
---
You have to earn it.
---
I get where you're coming from.  Sure, it's an advantage, but only in a roundabout way and not a competitive one.  The fact remains that they're not directly selling those items.  My increased ability to obtain things like bobbleheads does not make your game experience worse. Actually, with fewer people on public worlds, there's an increased chance for others to grab things like that.
---
Probably. The bankruptcy thing was to illustrate how poor &amp; unreliable Luke Stephens info is. You could easily make up something that sounds plausible but has no real hard evidence to back it up.
---
My desk does not; that'll teach me for reading reddits and drinking coffee at the same time...
---
But yes; these guys are pure gold :)
---
How do you 'win' a game that is a competitive?
---
oh please, spare me your false equivalencies. in gaming, slippery slopes are all too common, it starts out as "just cosmetic" all the time and then once devs realise that "huh, people are retarded and like spending money on a bunch of pixels that they used to get by playing the game, what suckers!" they start focusing more and more on microtransactions. the proof is there for all who are open to seeing it, bethesda have been showing their true colours for years and only now that it is so obvious a 17 iq monkey could see it do the majority actually care. the context in which people say things matters and pretending otherwise serves no one except yourself.
---
Hopefully, I am tired of the constant warring ideals of this game. I wish this sub would go back to talking about the upcoming events or Interesting encounters.
---
It's just more for people that want it, and for those that like the game it's not that bad
---
1st 12 month sub is half of Brazil's minimum wage
---
Name one game that's had this much controversy, ridicule, and rage directed at it. Even Anthem managed to get less derision.
---
So you have never played WoW have you? You buy the game and then pay a subscription to acess benifits.
---
Just build a Purifier and empty it every time you go back to your camp.
---
You lot said the same thing about the repair kits, then the scrap kits, then the fridge, and now we have literal pay2win in the game and you're like "oh it's just slippery slope."
---
If it walks like a duck, sounds like a duck and looks like a duck, I don't have to disect it to know it's a duck.
---
So I can voice my opinion if I want to.
---
Anti Materiel Rifle obviously. It can go with my Ranger armor :3
---
People say all sorts of things.
---
I can only go for either my personal experience or what I can dig out from the .esm
---
Archer reference, nice!
---
Outer Worlds is pretty awesome, yeah. And Fallout 76 has been lacking end-game content for months now.
---
Minecraft.
---
next?
---
At least Game Pass saved me $60. lol
---
Yeah I'm having issues with reddit in general the last little bit. Thought it was the Wi-Fi lol
---
You're worthless
---
Its more of an ever increasing loud room where one person complains, the another heard the other person complain which complains louder, then goes on and on.
---
&gt; Weight management has always been a thing in Bethesda games
---
Only in the field. Every game had methods of infinite safe storage (well, can't speak about Arena since I never played it and it's been so long since Daggerfall I can't remember if the houses and ship you could get had safe storage).
---
And we'll be here to point out that bs when they do.
---
Apparently it's a new vault. Code is 000000 thanks everyone for commenting
---
Nope. I buy a game and play it.  If there is nice dlc at a reasonable price I will buy it. What I won’t do is pay a yearly subscription for one game that cost more than the subscription to play all my games online. If you like it that’s fine. I think people are being taken advantage of on this.
---
I live in the US and we don't do VAT. My comment was basically just reflecting what I'm hearing from people outside the US. I do agree though, the price they're charging  Australians is ridiculous. whoever is responsible.
---
Seems like you are pretty entrenched, screaming at people who don't agree with you as well.
---
Before, I was hunting Scorch Beasts for fun and food, now it's even more rewarding to do so. Yay!
---
Sorry some people actually like video games?
---
The people who support fallout 1st yeah
---
HanSwolo87
---
That’s fine if you are ok with paying 100 a year.
---
Just wait till their premium servers are overloaded too.
---
It’s the next paywall, stay tuned for further updates. For a mere 59.99 you can complete the quest. 
---
It’s not the best choice, it’s spacers choice...

I absolutely love Outer Worlds that is why I'm part of both Outer Worlds and Fallout 76 subreddits!
---
😂 best comment I've seen yet through all this FO1st drama 🤣
---
How to fix the subscription system:
---
-Make it 5$, with increasing sales the longer you pay for it to make people stay longer (third month in a row is half the prize, 6th month is free etc). Adjust the Atom amount but still make it the best Atom to $ ratio.
---
-Keep the Ranger armor exclusive to people who have subscribed at least once but add a new fan requested outfits every month to keep players interested.
---
-Give the Tent, Scrap box and Private Instances to EVERYONE but keep some exclusive stuff for members: Tent skins and presets, persistent workshop building and the ability to place several persistent Camps on your private instances, Camps placed over each other, and so on. 
---
You give something new to keep players happy, and you also give them a reason to pay. This way all players are willing to play this game longer, which in turn will bring long term profit. Getting good reviews instead of driving away your player base also brings new players, sales and profit.
---
If you only look for short term profit your game as an investment is going to die. It's not even a year old yet. That said maybe I'm just undersestimating the whales and this game could run 5 years on paid only content for whales alone.
---
But it's optional though. The game is still the same if you don't have it. 1sters aren't getting any special game content aside from the scrap box (this isn't gonna any hours of enjoyment) and the tent (doesn't even have a workbench to scrap non-legendary gear at)
---
Rabble Rabble Rabble and Rabble.
---
Sorry some people aren't a fan of some people being very anti consumer and against video games? Every single person that pays for this is one more chance that it could be seen as a success, and that is a VERY dangerous thing and affects all of us.
---
Interesting question lol. But don't think it really matters because there's now way you'd get through a silo and launch faster than they'd respawn anyway, and with your whitespring example their mostly if not all glowing so just completely different spawns in general...
---
Oh I should've clarified, this was over a month ago. I stopped playing right after the first meat week.
---
So good points but they're never going to give F2P players the scrapbox and tent for free. It would anger the P2W players who've bought the subscription to get those items. Unless Bugthesda wants to turn around and refund everyone who bought a subscription...ha...ha...ha.
---
Post 27,197 today about the same topic.. we all know some of you hate the release of FO1st
---
Yes but it's not like we are given unreasonably low amount of stash weight currently.
---
I do think, however, it would be better if they limited the number of unique objects we have instead of setting stash weight, if such limit is necessary.
---
Pete Hines Litreally Said That All Atomic Shop Items Would Be Cosmetic Only, And Everything They’ve Added Are Community Submittes Ideas That Have Been Monetised That Should Be In The Base Game Like The Backpack You Idiot Sandwich
---
Except the future of this game is a bad thing for everyone. Fallout 76 needs to die if for no other reason than an example that companies can't get away with this crap. So Bethesda giving up on it would be a good thing as that would mean it hasn't been worth it and there's an increased chance they will scale back their aggressive monetization for future games.
---
For me it was the other way around, picked up a left arm and leg 3 stars for cheap, took a while to fine any good right arm/legs.
---
Report the griefers. This kind of shit shouldn't happen &amp; we shouldn't think it's acceptable.
---
Fallout 1st aren't above criticism for buying into such an anti-consumer practice but they don't deserve bullying or griefing.
---
lol surprised someone named Revan wouldn't know the fate of KotOR2
---
Fanboys?? So you start your “opinion” by making passive aggressive comments directed at those that hold a different opinion than you... ok... 
---
Ever think that maybe some people like it and enjoy it and actually wanted it? 
---
So just because they like it and pay for it which is 100% their choice... you have a problem with it... 
---
Does anyone tell you how you should play the game or what you should do or what you should buy or not buy? Probably not... 
---
If you don’t like it, don’t buy it... it’s literally that easy and does not effect YOUR game you willingly bought.
---
Yeah that or adding any randomized loot boxes.
---
#MeToo
---
After a 1st leaves the server, the players non-1st have 25 minutes till the server closes. If there is another 1st is in there it won't close.
---
Sorry I became very busy yesterday I'll send you a request later today if you're still up to it I completely understand if you're not
---
...    
---
I understand that, but when you convert that into US dollars, it's 80 more. So you're paying 100 AUD with is worth more than American dollars, thus you're paying more for it.
---
well what the sub is saying is also not wrong
---
Well I reached a point in the game where I did everything so dropping 4 nukes s day was the only interesting thing left
---
I think he's probably been overruled.
---
Except Bethesda doesn't care? The only thing they care about is money so every player that quits and doesn't play or pay is a win. People supporting stuff like this is what's killing gaming lmao how do you think we got here?
---
Yeah you really are
---
Right so exactly, you think 70% if gamers are shills because they use microtransactions to get skins.
---
It takes 20 or so minutes to shut down. If you logged back on straight away, of course it'll be there
---
You feel customers are being taken advantage of? You didn’t subscribe I assume? I did, I don’t feel taken advantage of
---
It’s a matter of opinion
---
Buddy why are you even here? You clearly don't understand what's going on if you think anyones feeling any envy lol thats honestly pretty funny
---
No, I think you have a fundamental issue with reading comprehension
---
I think i would be able to collect junk much quicker if I had the tent.
---
Bethesda have been providing them with a lot of milk.
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Its super clunky again on xbox now
---
I know.
---
I actually recently came across a 3\* Lever that just so happen to have Explosive bullets. the other perks aren't as noteable but the explosive bullets are nice..If only I had a suppressor though lol
---
The only way to take it out on Bethesda is for no one to pay for it. Which you're doing so you fully deserve it. Stop killing video games please and actually grow a spine. YOU should take it out on Bethesda that they want to charge you just for the ability to play in a private instance thats not even truly private or your own.
---
Pete said no paid dlc which is stupid he should charge you Bernie kids for their hard work and the urban dictionary isnt a real dictionary. I'll remind you of this in 4 months if you aren't homeless in San Fran or Seattle by then.
---
Amen
---
Bethesda hotfixed already
---
Because that's not just bypassing a little in game time that's bypassing rng entirely. No mechanic exists in the regular game to bypass rng.
---
Yeah people are lying, that's why bethesda even acknowledged it and there was a patch because of it, all because people lied.
---
Im not playing until they give me my game back. This is a terrorist hijack. Lol
---
If you can't repair a power plant it's safe to assume you have no need for fusion cores at this point in time. 
---
What's the need for them and what level are you? I'm curious now
---
How do you know?
---
I'll play!
---
It's a game not a 401k.
---
You don't have to do the missions in power plants, you can build enough generators to power up the fusion core thingy by yourself, and workshops usually have plenty of material for such things, or given time it would generate more material if you couldn't do it entirely on workshop materials.
---
Weird well if you got a friend they can farm it and give it to you
---
I hope you decide to come back to the game at some point, I think Bethesda for all their missteps is trying to get this sh*tshow right. And on the Pip-Boy... if you love Fallout it’s still a bad ass piece of memorabilia to have sitting next to your TV/monitor or wherever you display it. At least consider it, I know the game isn’t in a particularly good spot but Wastelanders will either make or break the game, at which point almost everyone will make their final decisions. Until then, good hunting in other games.
---
Or that the Private World is behind a pay wall.
---
From what I've read, it was an issue affecting a very small group of people, but it was an issue
---
You have to look at the bigger picture. If this subscription service, in a game you already paid for, that has microtranscations, on top of psn or live subscriptions, proves to be successful, it could not only impact future Fallout games, but the entire industry as a whole. Imagine if other companies kept content that should have been kept in the base game locked behind a subscription. I have seen this happen with microtransactions and loot boxes. They started small and once they proved to by profitable, the business practice spread to other games. I hope that it does not get to that point with subscriptions.
---
Door code all zeros, at least for now. I think it got noticed a couple of days ago.
---
Or or or, they've lost they're fucking minds. Horse armour.
---
I mean the power plant is the best way. Only real alternative is finding them on chassis
---
I just want the Gauss Gatling gun and Plasma Caster they teased a few months ago.  
---
[Gauss Gatling and Gauss Shotgun](https://i.imgur.com/kdE7yjP.png)  
---
[Gauss Pistol and Plasma Caster](https://i.imgur.com/kpo9vot.png)
---
None. It's wishful thinking.
---
Bethesda fixed it
---
Yes? That's literally what Fallout used to be hello? Oh and it's a massively better game too.
---
Wrong they already have.
---
It was $60 at launch. On their website it's $40 but it's on sale for $24 rn. The only time these non-cosmetic micro-transactions can be ok is in a free to play game, and even then they usually aren't.
---
I have no idea why a lot of people in this sub feel like it makes up a decent amount of the player base.  A majority of FO76 users don’t follow this sub.  A majority doesn’t give a shit about subscription stuff, they won’t pay or quit, they just don’t care.
---
Maybe if they made a special event out of it with some interesting rewards, it could jump start people using it. Not sure that system is what PvP ers  really want.
---
How is it so many damn commies play a game that rags on communist?
---
xD
---
To the [op](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiT2cxxEcNM&amp;t=3m48s)
---
It's been bullshit after bullshit and people are tired of it. Bethesda has shown they aren't going to listen. Its reached a boiling point and while I wouldnt grief others for buying it I understand why they are.
---
ENCLAVE FOREVER!!! JK JK! thinking about starting another character
---
Fallout 5
---
Nope. I got it during the free E3 weekend and then bought it for half price during the sale which could explain why I'm not as butthurt as some of these other people. I was playing ESO as a premium member before that so that's why I'm not surprised by the subscription service, I'm actually happy they did it. I also play on PC so I'm not being robbed by my console manufacturer on a monthly basis just so I can play games I bought. THAT is the ultimate form of Pay-wall bullshit if you ask me.
---
The fact that I missed all the drama from the initial release combined with all the factors I just listed probably add up to why my attitude towards the game is more positive than a lot of the people in this forum
---
I logged in hoping that the private servers would make adventure less buggy ,but no fps still sucks waited 24 minutes for west tek supermutants to spawn in and still had to go to another server. Christmas is around the corner and I think I'm going to get Outer Worlds...
---
You know things are irreversibly bad when you have to pay 100£ to make your 60£+ virtual shop that’s bugged to insanity better, but inadvertently (Obviously) turns out worse.  
---
Including the objective self loathing gained and social embarrassment gained from knowing actual real life currency worth value was spent on steaming piles of shit when any living organism can produce its own in seconds, for free.
---
Whilst youtubers make an honest living by warning audiences and gamers out there of the pig ignorant, money hungry, corporate festering pond scum that is the likes of Bethesda to not trust a single word, action or gesture that slips out of their arses.
---
Yikes..  you’re like the river in Egypt at this point, you know.. Da Nile
---
Anyone that bought this piece of shit deserve to be extorted for microtransactions.
---
The rest of the series I loved, and Bethesda used that against all of us. You can't just market something as one thing, and do a complete 180, and make something that appeals to a small minority of people. And amazingly, these brainlets actually defend Bethesda for anti consumer practices. I think at this point, it's sheer stupidity that drives what's happening in the community.
---
Potential BOS recruit? :P
---
From tests I've done, it doesn't proc from another player. Even a wanted player.
---
Indeed there is no winning, but you clearly oversimplified stuffs to invalid everything else OP told.
---
Autoscrap is useful when the space is limited; if you cant see that think of it as QoL without cost to Bethesda, meaning, it should be in the game; try to think in the other way around, get the current state and make.it worse, like we being able to scrap weapons only on weapon bench. QoL like that shouldn't cost.
---
 Move the camp is a pain,  so, its not event close to having a second camp. 
---
Private server sharing spawn with public is a MAJOR error and a very lazy one. If the world is empty to be able to be used as private, destroy it and rebuilt it, don't keep it cached.
---
I wonder how many of these decisions are actually being made by the more insulated parent company.
---
They've basically already recieved money from Microsoft to fund the game and keep the studio staff paid. Microsoft is their cusion that they've been needing. How well the game performs, including metrics from how many play on Game Pass, will likely determine how much they are given for their next game.
---
nice try bethesda, insulting the people protesting your crap isn't going to make fallout 76 any better of a game. i hope they don't let you get away with it this time.
---
I can't upload a post with a pic so I just did a text post. Having similar issues...
---
Yet he's still being upvoted. The apologists are the reason this behavior is accepted.
---
lmao this game
---
They'll never convince me that the plan was to put out a Fallout game without NPC's.   I think NPC's were likely part of the plan all along, but they couldn't finish it in time for a 2018, even 2019 release.  So they released a half- finished game and are now like "Hey! Now we have NPC's!"
---
I'd like to sign up for Xbox.  GT BOS Outfitters

New legendary affects will be thirst and hunger quenchers that will be available in the atom store as attachments that you can put on your duped legendaries.

You can make more .50 cal than .308. and yes normal .50 cal does more dmg than Refined (but it could be something about speed or stuff) and by making a hunting rifle with .50ccal I can pretend to have a Anti mat rifle :C

If it’s been a verbal statement... not quite so much.

That’s why unless it’s in print, I don’t put too much stock in any corporation’s claims.
---
I was expecting like $7.99 a month.  $13 isn't worth what I'd get out of it.  I was thinking about doing it for a month just to run around solo, but hell, you rarely run across another player as it is.

greed, greed never changes...

Anyone who uses pa or certain guns need them norm +50 in lvl.
---
Not gonna lie... that sounds AWESOME. That and an underwater vault. 👀
---
So you can give money to a company providing worse services than games that are entirely free to play? I dont get it.
---
Agree. I have been getting super lag on xbox servers also
---
Thank you. But I want to suggest the term Pay for Quality of Life
---
Because that's your instanced server.... if they made your server completely reset every time you log off then people would exploit that for rare items.
---
And the dumbest conspiracy theory award goes to...
---
It really true that you normally buy a game and enjoy its full features.
---
But it is not in all OLG's case, there has to be DLCs/micros/Premiums to support the game, since this game is offering free DLC (tho small scaled for now), it's only natural they would try to earn money from the other options. I have to add even games like Guild Wars 2 cannot rely on DLCs alone for revenue and has to have micros. I'd say there is no P2P OLG currently can rely on DLC alone.
---
But the game is just shitty at currently state, selling a premium for this product is outrageous.
---
My wife has the subscription and it’s a fresh server upon login for the day.  If she logs off and logs back in within 30 minutes it’s the same server.  The server shuts down and she will get a new server after that.  Remember thou how loot works, new server doesn’t mean repopulated loot.
---
having your community pissed at you, not listening to there advice and adding wanted features that was said to be free and then having them behind a pay Wall is bad business. The "its just a game lol" really degrades your points overall but by putting features and paid walls behind stuff is arguably predatory to those who feel left out or have some kinda of compulsive  condition. So if your points rely on " its business"  and " just a game" the business model is wrong and people are speaking against it in order to change it and "just a game" yeah it is but their can be fallout for these kinda of lies
---
What bothers me is that there are so many people willing to forgive beth for all the shit they have done. I bet many people in this sub would "thank" beth if they release an above average wastelanders update and maybe drop the price of the subscription. I just wish people dont give this shady company any second chances. They screwed you over and that's that. This lenient behavior only shows them that what they did is ok and they will be more than happy to do it again.
---
K, no one cares, take a number, please have a seat, blah blah blah.
---
I strongly suspect what you're attributing to Bethesda is attributable to Zenimax.
---
Wow such empty
---
If you think they ask... I've got some water front property on hte moon for ya.
---
I hardly know her!
---
The 29th.
---
It seems to be reddit wide, actually. Pull up a private browser, logged out, sort by newest on the homepage, and for a good portion, it'll say "X comments," but nothing shows up.
---
I believe this decision was made because they're bleeding money. Every single Bethesda game has been a massive hit. This one was a huge risk that not only was a large game, but require a continual server expense they've never had to deal with before. But that didn't matter, because every other game was a hit so why wouldn't this one be? Except it wasn't. Now they're this project is bleeding out.
---
Not that I'm defending decision. I like to believe that some well-meaning developer pitched a handful of ideas to business leader decision makers (people who control the purse). And those decision makers chose the worst option because they had no choice and all other projections would put the project at a net loss. I like to believe that. But Bethesda is so tight lipped that it's hard to believe it.
---
What we do know for sure:
---
* FO76 is not nearly as profitable as other Bethesda games
---
* FO76 is at least as expensive to develop as other Bethesda game
---
* FO76 is more expensive to support than any Bethasda game (unless you count the MMO)
---
Someone at Bethesda is in a fight for their career and is making desperate choices that hurt Bethesda's name.
---
Thanks. Where is it in game?
---
You mean in a cave or .. do you want what every Adequate\_Sub wants .. a vault in a SUBMARINE?
---
Yeah sure they did.
---
Snap... I forgot to mention we only have a PC branch...
---
I have stopped playing but Bethesda doesn't care about me because they got my purchase of the game already so quitting doesn't matter as ,much of some other games with subscriptions. If people are quitting in angry and no longer supporting the game thus making the game player base smaller (which means less potential sells/money) they will look for a reason why and try and fix it
---
Yeah, that happens. It's actually a known fact* that Bethesda will just take your game away if you don't put more than the initial purchase cost into the game. Sorry man, you're gonna have to subscribe to Fallout 1st and sign a 12 page agreement to whöre your wallet out to the Atom store if you want to get your game back.
---
Again, I'm really sorry. It happens to the best of us, really.
---
*based on a 100%† accurate study.
---
† Study was not 100% accurate but if we said anything else you might not give Bethesda more money so... Yeah... You can find Atom cards at your local GameStop and other game retailers 👍
---
to me that doesnt make sense because ya company make bad decisions some time but there are so many people in company that have to sign off that this amount of incompetent wouldn't happen they would have fired everyone by now
---
&gt; I think the community has lost sight of what “Pay 2 Win” means. 
---
What all the crying is about is "*you've got something I don't, even though you had to pay for it!*".
---
&gt;or was forced to by parent Zenimax
---
Just letting you know that Bethesda Softworks founded Zenimax.
---
It goes:
---
    Bethesda Softworks -&gt; Bethesda Game Studios
---
                       -&gt; Zenimax Media
---
                                    -&gt;Zenimax Online
---
Zenimax was made by bethesda exclusivly to handle the business side. It makes no sense to blame them since, they're basically the same company.
---
Just like you :)
---
Then do your part and don't buy the subscription. The last time I checked this was still a free country so why should you care if others do pay for the subscription? The object of the game is not to make the game miserable for others. There is a mode that is for PVP. There are also several games that are actually made for PVP like COD. I would just like to be able to play the game with my wife and some of our online friends without dealing with immature idiots. When I want to PVP I play COD where there is a level playing field so it is actually about skill instead of being 100 levels higher than someone with a bunch of PVP focused perk cards, weapons and armor.

While I like the idea, I don’t think you’ll see something like this in this game, and likely, not In this console generation. But in the future, you are right, it would be cool to see a game that just continued to expand the map every couple of years. 
---
Fo4 would have been perfect for this. Secure the commonwealth for whatever side, and every couple of years have an update that adds more map and missions, and see how players can “lead” the commonwealth and their faction to expand by recruitment or conquest, or, tear down what they’ve built in want of a new faction like the nukaworld raiders tried to make us do.
---
This is the first comment I’ve seen...
---
Naw fam you only get one server for a specific time. They ain't dumb.
---
Although I agree many Youtubers are milking the subject, as long as they’re putting Bethesda more in the Public light so they can have a fire lit under their ass then let them.
---
I may be wrong but I believe the tombstone is used when you die and the guts is when you manually drop items. I remember them saying somewhere there would be separate ones for each.
---
I see this comment, can’t yet see any other comment on other posts yet.
---
Cool story.  It's ALMOST like people are allowed to express their opinions.  Personally you look like a fool for getting so butt hurt about me expressing mine.
---
I've never spent a penny in the atom shop, spending money on fake furniture and costumes seems childish to me. I have only spent maybe 1500 of the atoms they gave me. My balance is 4970 I think?
---
Are you seeing the same thing?
---
I hope it all goes into the next game. If these tactics are tricking people into funding improvements for their single player titles, I’m bummed they’d do something so deceitful, but not surprised at all. it would explain how this game is 100% still broken. I bet the grafton mayor still talks every time you join a server.
---
I'd like to see the tesla cannon return, could use like 10% of a fusion core per shot and deal a ton of energy damage in its initial AOE then chain like it did in Broken Steel.
---
It actually does and it's very easy to replicate. I'll get a video of it later.
---
 "Is there something like, fishy about it? "
---
No - just repair it.  Not a bad deal - people sell all sorts of things.
---
I was, but weirdly i saw your comment
---
Its a theory, but i see a bit of a hole:
---
By ruining Bethesda into the ground, they are destroying too many future possibilities. Players wont want to play there games anymore, and even those who want to wont be able to because Bethesda wont be able to run any of the servers needed to do so. Also, if Bethesda has a plan to re open at a later date, whether it be under a new name or whatever, they will have already given themselfes such a bad rep that i dont know if they will make enough to make this entire plan worth it in the end.
---
My opinion is that they started 76 with the intention to keep all their promises, they just needed extra money from atoms to help with server upkeep. They ended up getting more money from it than they thought they would, and the people making the important choices (which could just be like 5 people out of the entire company) started seeing dollar signs.
---
Because stories evolve?  I feel like no matter what I say you're just going to spin it to be negative because you're set on not liking the game.  I don't really have time for that to be perfectly honest.  Like said, you can just not like the game, no reasonable person is going to hate you for it.
---
Everyone that thinks company's dont do market research and actually believe they domt know what they're doing
---
Damn you can get a hooker in Bangkok for the price of 1st! What the hell Beth
---
Example. I replied to 3 comments and see 6 comments total but pulling up post and view all I only see 2... weird...
---
Ok so I can understand the timer but why are almost all of the bobble heads magazine and cap stash locations absent of items? Just curious what's going on there also and no I haven't picked them up recently if that helps.
---
Dont forget they will come in lootboxes filled with useless rewards and a 1% chance of getting what you actually want.
---
Exactly ^
---
I'm just assuming I've been blocked by folks
---
Yes. My friend and I actually talked about it. While on a dead server we had a crazy increase on mob spawns. From Morgantown on South we found pockets of hoards.
---
I would advise you to look at Market76 they r usually up for sell or trade. Trying to find specific piece randomly it's kinda hard. U will find one eventually but the stats may nt be the one u looking for.
---
Click the view all comments, can you see them?
---
Yeah, dunno why people are crying. High level players who've been around don't need it. It's really a speed pass for lower levels who need caps for the plans, still looking for gear. I don't even consider the guys who paid for things with rl money, what a waste.
---
The smooth server is nice if you're into the raids, but other than that. Still been able to farm scrip in public. The thing I would change is the atom payout on subs and maybe restrict the 2nd camp to private. Or at least put a 40 cap move fee on it.
---
They moved to the other sub
---
Can't we do that with public servers anyway? Doesn't that make public better for collectors?
---
Nope, think it's reddit having a shit-wheeze
---
It should’ve been free from the beginning
---
Yeah they seem a bit more tanky now
---
I can see some but mostly empty. Will you read this? Who knows.
---
They add weight? Fuck me. Here is a thing you don't want that is hard to find in your inventory that you will never use and it adds weight lol.
---
Who's attacking whom here?
---
And close the door of my camp.
---
no, wait...
---
I really want to, I would be starting over. But I think it would be fun, I have a ton of technical data on my other character you can have as well.
---
It doesn't even need to be over other players. Pay2win exists in single player games, gems and stamina bars and all that shit.
---
Players using glitches, dupers and things not meant to do like building underground all cause issues since they aren’t suppose to happen or be done. 
---
Bethesda now focuses more on those issues which the player may do instead of having people fix other issues. 
---
Blame can be pointed in multiple different directions here.
---
Oh, get it already, it's AMAZING!!!!
---
&gt; All the talented and passionate creators at Bethesda having to bend the knee to a profit first mentality.
---
Plenty of opportunity out there for talented and experienced gamedevs.
---
A current video if you could. We couldn't get it to go off.
---
Buy them from player vendors, you might find them cheap.
---
Good point maybe there is no after. If created something I was proud of and then some forced me to turn it into something that fundamentally disagreed with my ideals I'd rather see it burn then turn into a monstrosity
---
Who cares how many objects can be picked up and interacted with if the game is unplayable?  And the idea that the gameplay in this is novel is a joke.  It’s a hoarding simulator.  They should have had half or a third the amount of objects and put out a game that could be played.
---
They just copy and pasted a bunch of stuff from FO4 and Skyrim for crafting without a thought to how needlessly convoluted the system is.  The junk system could easily eliminate half its currencies and it would still be more or less the same.  It’s bad craftsmanship.  Not to mention that the environment is not interactive.  You can’t destroy structures or even damage them besides player built ones.
---
And yeah games like WoW, Destiny, ARR don’t have the same level of interaction with the environment.  But they have a variety of fun to play game modes and rewards based on actually playing the game as opposed to just mindlessly hoarding crap.
---
Just because 76 crammed more stuff into the game doesn’t make it good.  Actually kind of the opposite.  Too many currencies in online games is a problem.  Even if the game ran flawlessly and functioned the way it’s supposed to the crafting system would still be bad because it’s needlessly complicated.
---
Can you be both, would I have to start a new character?
---
I see it and can read it but another persons comments I can only read in the notification and not in the post???...lol
---
Yeah, the argument that you don’t like it cause you can’t afford it is probably the weakest possible argument they can make. It’s extremely childish, but then again, they’re probably kids
---
Another is Cal Ripkin Jr., a former major league baseball player.
---
These are not people who care in the slightest about the Fallout franchise, or the modding community, or anything. It's absolutely just about finance. 
---
I don't think it's right to be throwing so much shade at Bethesda, though they are complicit in a way.
---
Lots of people use it. I'm sure it must be one of the most popular sets in the game. Most people dont sell it in their vendors as it has high value and is usually kept for trade only.
---
Ya my main point is they are intentionally burning it the ground instead of letting become a monster
---
I'm tempted to take a break from leveling on my private server to go back to public and see how many butthurt crybabies I meet.
---
There are also core stations all over the map, but they don’t always have a core in them.
---
This \^
---
I mean...yeah yeah.
---
Like what?
---
You can place a door on the camper, open it. Them place another door in the entrance making a stack of 20+ doors.
---
Also if placed near a tree or on a camp object like a nuka planter or fire place. You can make the bungalow float. 
---
I find it annoying that the camper eats object or places them on the roof.
---
Liberator detected.
---
They would only release the figures if they were great.
---
No figures = low player numbers.
---
That's what drew me, the ME feel tbh
---
Specially when I switch weapons, use drugs or alcohol, use Vats, or get hit a lot like when tanking a Minigun Supermutant. And my character is a melee/explosive alcoholic junkie.
---
Oh and managing stash and selling to vendor lags me a lot, like on release.
---
Sounds like you don't even play, why are you here then
---
Because Bethesda cares at all at this point about angering its playerbase.
---
I’m not in the dumps- fallout first is great
---
Facts
---
I have the same issue but I do see this comment for some reason.
---
Basically. Servers cost money.
---
The stupidity here is that they released an unfinished game. And that they didnt have a clear monetization plan for the game. 
---
I mean the whole atom shop idea was seriously half assed. Only an idiot would think that think could bring in enough revenue to keep the game running.
---
Ah thank you. I’m kind of a noob so I was just wondering.
---
Also, is that glitch where someone just takes all of your shit still a thing from launch?
---
I’ve already uninstalled this trash and won’t be going back now
---
Yeah i actually dont care im just showing off my camp
---
Title is super accurate!  An anxiety-producing work of art.  Well done!
---
A person boycotting a company does nothing. Talking heads can get other people to boycott the company as well, which can achieve something.
---
Maybe you weren't looking for them.
---
This game isn't only combat, and winning doesn't just constitute killing others.
---
I honestly think that would be awesome
---
20 minute timer to get back into your server.  So you have to wait, needs to be confirmed but someone had mentioned you just swap to a second character. I would also guess joining a public leaving and joining a new private would work too.
---
No! They would never block you..
---
Ps4
---
I think the PC players are less salty because they're not getting robbed by their console manufacturer on a monthly basis just to be able to play online. I play on PC myself and I see scrap boxes in the majority of camps I visit.
---
Realizing you have an OCD of this magnitude is the first step..... :)
---
Very well done, friend.
---
Yes - at least on a private world you are not watching your back all the time or checking your map for other players sneaking up on you ( not knowing their intentions ).
---
OK. Thanks

Mark my words: that shit ain’t happening. 4th and fifth star effects will be like “+5 Health” like all rise and “15 fire damage” like Perfect storm
---
The servers are designed to rest regularly. 
---
Its cost prohibitive to create a fresh image for each player with this design. 
---
When a fresh server is spun up, it should be at the default state.
---
Does your phone or pc automatically capitalize every word? Or are you doing that on purpose? If so.. why are you writing like that?
---
Or it was all dictated by Zenimax, under quiet opposition by The Todd, who finally agreed, but coyly suggested October 23, to which Zenimax said "fine, whatever!" while drinking more unicorn blood.
---
There are at least a dozen PA spawns in the Forest alone, along with a large number of fusion generators.  Any of those is likely to have at least a 25% core, sometimes more.
---
In addition, to those dozen....
---
here’s a couple freebies for you - 
---
go to Camden park.  THere is an event there.  You may get one from the event.  There’s also a PA spawn there.  Might be one in the PA suit.  There are 2 fusion generators.  And they may be one loose in an ammo can.  Total potential cores at Camden park: 5.
---
You can find up to 3 at wade airport..
---
There’s the potential for at least 3 in the nuka cola plant.
---
Nobody cares
---
Lol fair enough haha
---
Highly trained Reddit Guys are working to resolve the problem even as we speak. Breath!
---
People are upset ( some of them ) because they did not get these things for free.
---
This subreddit is full of people trying to rationalize their abusive relationship
---
It's worse than pay to win, it's pay to lose... all your scrap.
---
Alright first of all, stop twisting the narrative I said that NV, 1 and 2 were legendary, Never said legendary works of art. I do believe that all games are works of art, since making them takes artist to do so, Some less then others, but yet still pieces of art. My judgement stands because just like some people find a toilet to be art then people can find video-games as art too. Since like i said it takes time to create, make, design and draw the characters, the environment, etc.
---
Just don't do the subscription for shit they should've made work a year ago lol. That's what I'm doing still having fun!
---
Uuuuh. What if they simply made all this functionality available without a paywall?
---
Thats not how it works kid
---
Yeah, but now the ones on that side of the issue have pay to win mechanics.
---
In the end they know that the die hard who play this game WILL pay, the game was a failure and only those who for whatever reason love this game WILL pay.
---
NightinGery#8190 on discord if you are  on PC
---
Agree just like outlaws pass in RDO
---
No? But good try 👍🏻
---
I posted this in it's own thread but here is why I think you're seeing anyone claim to be finding more Legendary mobs on PWs...
---
As  I understand it, mobs in the game only spawn within a certain  distance  of a player, ie if you load into the game at Watoga as the only player in the game there will be no spawns at WS yet. Every mob(that can be Legendary) that spawns has a % chance to spawn as a Legendary. I'm not sure but I believe that % chance must increase over time if no other Legendary mobs spawn or we could potentially have  servers with no Legendary spawns due to RNG. Therefore there must be some kind of  guaranteed spawn chance after a certain point to ensure  whatever %  Bethesda wants of overall mobs in the game are spawning in  as Legendary.  As a solo player on a PW ALL the Legendary mobs over time HAVE to spawn somewhere within a radius of the only player in the world since nobody else is triggering Legendary mobs elsewhere. The PWs  have the same  overall % of mobs spawning in as Legendary they just are  not scattered  across the entire map between 24 players activating  spawns.
---
Edit: Here is the original post... [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnwscq/yes\_you\_possibly\_are\_seeing\_more\_legendary\_mobs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dnwscq/yes_you_possibly_are_seeing_more_legendary_mobs/)
---
And it's apparently also full of people that don't play or care about this game but have nothing better to do then comment about it?
---
the game is great, the artwork and banter alone make it worth more than 76. 76 straight up nixed npc characters and reused all of its old assests from fo4 lol. for what obsidian had for a budget the game is more in depth than FO4 and 76 could ever hope to be.
---
Not necessarily, no. But if you want to level a new one, we would gladly help out and give good starter gear too.
---
At what point do you stop giving them chances?
---
Down the capitalists
---
Not this way. It just makes you look like an asshole.
---
I can't take these posts seriously when they start off with how Fallout 1st isn't a good deal, nor will I even read the rest when that's the first point, for £11.99 you get over £10 worth of Atoms, a unique outfit that would probably cost about 900 Atoms (which you would have to buy another £8 worth of Atoms for), icons, emotes, unlimited junk and a buttery smooth private server (which is handy for Raids and farming nuked WS without idiots 1-shotting all legendaries), as well as a handy tent.
---
It's way better value than these 1500 Atom bundles they put out. You just cannot state that it isn't good value.
---
Well said. 
---
Though people shouldn't bully each other or give these players shit for it. 
---
Trolling people is a bitch move.
---
I’ve been getting the disconnects and rubber-banding on my private instance too.  I suspect that they may have underestimated the amount of private servers that they’d need to spin up and are now either bandwidth constrained or are needing to tweak the hardware profiles on the VMs that the server instances are running on.
---
Exhibit 1
---
your technical data stockpile will count towards your ranking up, so that will come in handy.
---
Well pretty sure that if they would get in legal trouble...not a lawyer or anything but to me, if they went and gave what is right now EXCLUSIVE to P2W players to F2P players for free...people could take action against Bethesda saying they paid for items thinking it was the only way to get them and now Bethesda's just giving it away...
---
Again not a lawyer and I'm probably not explaining it right but it just doesn't seem like something they'd do without shit hitting the fan.
---
Agreed, but with somthing big like this, you wouldn't just ditch the game industry, and Bethesda has done some amazing work (admittedly I've only played fo4, but i loved it, and I've heard great things from the fans), but if they were to re brand and release a new game, people would know who they were and it might not go over very well
---
If you are on Xbox I have a full combat armor set I’ll sell you. I don’t run bloodied any more so I don’t need it.
---
Everyone who doesn’t have fallout first shouldn’t be mad at the ones who do. Fallout first players are adding revenue to future free content etc
---
A lot of the perks coincide with specific weapons or armor.
---
For example, the lowest level PA part other than a bare frame is L15, so why make PA perks available before then?
---
Rifles, pistols, shotguns, and melee weapons are available right out of the vault; so are many associated perk cards.
---
You're just a fucking idiot.
---
Whatever you say Todd
---
Add lower level heavy guns?
---
What if you never have issues with the game? It's not broken for me in any way.
---
Oo meow. 
---
I’ll be following this thread closely, I predict claws.
---
I mean it's either there or this literal shitting grounds for a game we all play.
---
Exactly -the OP is a griever/pvp/troll asshole.
---
Imagine! A difference of opinion! On the internet! Blasphemy!
---
Or we like the game and urge Bethesda while also getting stuff we want. Fallout is a unique game that a lot of people still enjoy, but carry on. Still wish they’d put stuff separate like private world 3.99/mo, the emotes and outfits in the shop, and whatnot, with the big bundle being all of that plus the eventual discounts
---
Outer WORLDS
---
Why care about what others think? Do what you want.
---
I have the game on two platforms and I have played both since beta. I have not had a single game breaking bug/crash on either one. I had the funny power armour visual bug a few times. But flawless other than that.  I think a lot of the issues were over blown
---
Ps4?
---
It's about the ethics of their decisions and the long-term impact, not the short-term impact of the items themselves. Their deception is unethical and their practices are anti-consumer. Their decisions are based on greed and not on the willingess to make the best product possible for their consumers. For that, they deserve harsh criticism and pushback. For people like you that don't look at the big picture, these things are harmless. I (and many others) on the other hand see it as a downhill slope that will not only impact bethesda and their future games, but the industry as a whole. 
---
They apply measures that hurt the game and its potential. For example, putting utility items behind a paywall worsens (even if by a tiny margin) the experience for all players who don't buy compared to those who do. Putting cosmetics behind a paywall is ok because cosmetics are subjective as they have no tangible/sizeable objective purpose (most of the time). We can spend hours talking about the impact of the shitty decisions they made and how this "divide" is bound to get bigger over time as they add more utility items behind a paywall but I hope you get the point.
---
That's sucks, but kind of to be expected I guess. If it makes anyone feel better it also seems to work the other way as well. I bumped into a couple of players fighting a Legendary Super Mutant at the Abandoned Bog Town, myself and one of the others were wearing our Ranger costumes and we helped each other out and went our own way afterwards and sending a few emotes and chems to each other. It was honestly quite nice.
---
To keep the game going?! Its barely over a year old? We were promised fallout 76 would run forever
---
Thanks a lot!
---
I am far from a hater, I put my time, and support into this game. A whole lot of time, and money. 
---
Now I am upset with the circumstances, and  instances of the game. 
---
To be blunt, the game is broken, and continues to be broken!
---
 Why should I, who paid $250 + dollars, this is including the Power Armor Addition,  and extra Atoms in the  beginning, before launch. Have to tolerate another slap in the face. I have put up with more than my share of Bullshit in, and from this game, over the last year. 
---
Bottom line, broken promises, broken game, broken, broken, broken. 
---
Where is the  thank you for your continued support, and putting up with all the B.S. "No" It's thanks for nothing, pay more for, more Bullshit instances, more broken game play, and more broken promises. 
---
I love this game, I dislike Bethesdas business practices. And because of that, I have decided to walk away. I am not a donkey, I may look like one. But that is beside the point. I am not going to tolerate shady Shenanigans. 
---
I wish you, and any one else the best, and it not up to me to  tell you, or any one else what to do, when it comes to Fallout 76.
---
 But I do have the wright to voice my opinion, and frustration with the game. 
---
So call me a hater, but remember! I have played this game for over 2000hrs. And that gives me some traction, when it comes to what I think of Fallout 76. 
---
And at this point, I am not impressed. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
Drinking from a stream, I use cannibal and lead belly, too for the rads
---
Hey you do you. Just make sure you don’t post it on here. People will freak for some reason
---
Thanks for the reply, this seems reasonable.
---
OP is such a Liberator he's the boss at Mamma Dulces.
---
Hold up what are we complaining about now?
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m a firm believer in “you do you.” If you enjoy something, do it. My post is to try and explain why people who get the pass is getting a ton of hate from others and to hopefully help people understand their perspective.
---
Ok, I'll have that in mind
---
Lmao. What a bunch of entitled punks. Where do you get off telling how to spend my money or who I should or should not support? You are right about one thing, I vote with my wallet and now I'm switching from s monthly sub to get a full year sub, largely because I'm sick of you all thinking you have any say whatsoever about how I get my entertainment or what I enjoy doing.  I've been a "gamer" longer than most of you have been alive. I'll damn well support who I like and how I like. Looking through the post/comment history of a huge portion of the people stoking the shitstorm,  the bulk don't even play 76, they're playing a tom of other games with MTX and are complete hypocrites.

xbox one: Davey OwO

They could probably do a client-side server for PC users but they don't because then all the console users would be crying even more than they already are. Plenty of them already seem to blame bethesda for the fact that they have to pay PlayStation or XboxLive just to be able to game online.  They all want people to boycott Bethesda because of the 'Pay-wall' that doesn't actually prevent them from playing the game. Meanwhile their console manufacturer has them locked behind a paywall that prevents them from playing every single online game they own without subscribing. Sounds to me like it's the console manufacturers that should be boycotted for holding all of their online content hostage.
---
You can join him in his server if he has the sub, even if you don't.
---
You mean a better reward and the random 1 star legendary you get for the top reward that takes multiple events to save up enough candy for?
---
People are currently targeting 1st players, so yeah, I'd say so.
---
I know but he hasn't got the subscription.
---
Shouldn’t get any hate
---
What platform are you on?
---
That's the thing though, you just aren't included in the targeted audience... they ran the numbers and figured the maximum profit to be made, without any concern with fairness to their fans.
---
So it’s okay to hate others because they have a different opinion??? 
---
Sorry but there literally isn’t any excuse you can make or state that will ok this behavior. 
---
People buy it so what? They use their money they earn to make choices to buy or not buy... pretty simple... 
---
If people want to act like asshats because someone bought it they probably aren’t mature enough for the real world overall and part of the bigger problem outside of Fallout. 
---
If they have issues with the pass that makes them hate... well real life they must be outraged and need a safe place for sure!
---
xbox one, gt is Davey OwO
---
I still play it because I enjoy the game. I know it's crazy.
---
OWEN!  Bring me a coke with some ice in it!
---
But I wouldn't do anything to them, even more, I would offer to use my survival tent for anyone who needs it.
---
Have you done the quest line yet?
---
i did. just too many better options out there with less drama and shady practices, i truly hope people get the content they want out of this game, but it seems very unlikely.
---
Can I ask why you care what a random internet stranger whom you will never meet thinks? Do what you want and don’t worry about it.
---
Consider yourself in the minority. We dont have to pretend the games perfect. Your guns empty every time you fire up in a new server thats a flaw. Ignoring the issues outright is just being ignorant.
---
Who gives a fuck what anyone else thinks, just ignore it and report them (if on Xbox I hear they're pretty strict on harassment etc), go for it, private servers are great.
---
i have but i need one thats level 50!
---
Thanks, I was worried 'cause maybe some griefers come to my friends camp and mine just for destroy it.
---
Then buy it if you want to, and fuck the Internet strangers who think that is "right" to insult other players.
---
I am absolutely against the Fallout 1st sub, but I know that Bethesda is to blame for that, not the players.
---
Fully awake.  Understand the product and the history.  Would prefer all items/features to be free.  Regardless, the entertainment is worth my money.  Respect it's not worth yours; either by value or principle.  
---
PS Tried an hour or so of Outerworlds under Gamepass.  Decent so far, but after F3, F4, and NV, I have an emotional attachment to the Fallout world and am willing to part with more $'s to continue to play in it.
---
Damn, I'm on PC, sorry. Hopefully someone on XBONE will see this and be able to help. 
---
Good luck!
---
People that like this subscription will ignore this and say no that’s not pay to win, just don’t buy it if you don’t like it.
---
The solution isn't to make the map bigger, it's to instance more places. You look at any fallout game or any elder scrolls game especially Skyrim and you can see that the thing making those games so much bigger is the amount of dungeons and whatnot you can go into.
---
Haha I’m not buying the stupid pass and this is still a stupid take. Gamers are not united in anything, Half the people on this sub trolling already bought the pass. I have more respect for those admitting they bought in than people like you who think you know what’s best for everyone. 
---
In case you haven’t been playing since the pass went live, Gamers already voted with their wallets and it’s a tsunami of Mothman/Robot emotes. Now the ball is in Bethesda’s court to make the service viable to more people and to keep those who bought in happy.
---
If you bought in, Thank you. Don’t listen to the soiled diaper crowd.
---
You know that just gives you a fedora. Dont tease.
---
I don’t play fo76, (never was big into any of the fallout games) I’m merely offering the perspective of those who hate on people in your position.
---
My post isn’t even me voicing my own opinion per se. I’m a firm believer in “you do you” and if “you like it, do it”. But I saw some threads where people were wondering why they were getting hate and harassed and wanted to share the perspective of why the people sending the hate do it.
---
Takes one to know one, I suppose
---
I was level 70 and it gave me a level 20 gun, I think they want an on level one
---
yeah dude haha, thanks anyway man. its hard out here
---
damn i was waiting for that reply. lol
---
No man's sky should be an example of how to flip a game all the way back around and make it fun again for old and new players not this stupid subscription
---
I foresee them adding "loyalty" rewards for people who maintain a sub.  IE, 3, 6, 12 month rewards or whatever.
---
A random griefer probably won’t know you are a subscriber, and they can’t get on your private world anyway. Plus if you have passive on there’s nothing they can do to you unless you are defending a workshop on a public server.
---
I got the subscription the day it came out and I've been running around in my NCR gear on public servers and have yet to receive any 'hate' in-.game. actually I see the scrap boxes in the majority of camp site visit. I play on PC though and it seems like the PC players are less salty because they're not already paying for a subscription just be able to play their games online.
---
Probably, but who cares?
---
YouTubers are not the problem here.
---
The game for non subscribers is the same as it ever was in every possible way.   Literally nothing changed. 
---
If you enjoy the game, 1st won't somehow magically change that.
---
Whats the price of armors #153 and #154? :)
---
I agree, but then again, fo4 still isnt finished. 76 came out as a dumpster fire, but it had alot of potential, and then then threw napalm on it. Maybe the income was just ment to supplement there other incomes? Or they were looking at the money they were making from fo4s creation club and eso? Nobody really knows the story untill we get told
---
Technically unless you let everyone know they will never know...  being on Reddit in this subreddit knowing that it can get heated... not a good move... now they’ll know..
---
I never bought fo76, I’m not even a fallout fan. I just follow gaming news and let me tell you, this is big. I don’t even know what it is you do in the game besides walk around a map with no NPCs and kill hostile NPCs with bad shooting mechanics. I may be wrong, but that’s my understanding of the game.
---
&gt;Most of the player base is actually really friendly and good people...
---
And yet you are more toxic than the Flint water supply 😂 You are the reason people are dropping like flies; your aggressive attitude when defending BGS directly drives players to other games with better communities.
---
When the servers are all filled with nothing but edgy kids and bitter adults who never wish to interact with anyone else, remember this post and that you played a role in that.
---
A gimp suit?
---
I dunno what's happening. Even this post says it has 12 replies (13 now), but I only see 2 (plus mine). Normally we'd at least see the removed ones.
---
It's not us.
---
It's the same few people on every thread making the exact same arguments.
---
I hope they're getting paid because otherwise it's just pathetic.
---
im the same, if someone is doing something stupid and harmful ill try to give advice to prevent further harm, but when the collective fanbase tells people "fuck off its fine" i will happily watch with a beer in hand as their world slowly burns away. you cant fix stupid, but you sure as hell can laugh at it.
---
People have no right to blame other people for Bethesda’s problems. And one group of “gamers” should not look down their nose at another group.
---
If a group hates the game that much, deinstall your copies and delete your Bethesda accounts. Bethesda does keep track of those stats and actions speak louder than words.
---
If I feel like spending MY money on something, frankly it’s no one else’s business. And to blame me and people like me for issues you have with Bethesda is just plain wrong.
---
Reddit isn't even a quarter of all the fallout 76 player base
---
You came at the community all guns blazing and now this...
---
\-todd howard disliked that-
---
I just want to know if the Scrap box is going to act like ESO.
---
There you could pay for a month, fill up your crafting bag and then still have access to it when your sub expired. You couldn't put more in, but you could always take stuff out.  
---
Frankly if they're doing the same thing here, I'd be highly inclined to get a month and just go on a Junk collecting bender....
---
Never had problems from the start.  Over 5K in steel and 3K in acid stored and safe.
---
I play on Ps4
---
Bravo,
---
Did you support them with your $99? Otherwise this is about as useful as atoms.
---
You know how everyone keeps saying " if they do this, i will delete this game", well I have. It cleared up space on my hard drive for other games like Outer worlds, you that game from obsidian. The company that had made one of the best fallout games ever?!! People forget that Bethesda bought the rights to fallout, but they do not have the heart to make it amazing. The company is after $$$$, not fan satisfaction. Less and less of my diehard fan boy friends are returning to the game, and to be honest the game isn't that fun without the buddies you have made in game. Its fun with others, but it is a poor single player game compared to many others. If you dislike the game now, delete it. Ill redownloaded it in when the add npcs, but for now i will let them fix any kinks.
---
No. But people will insult you because they have nothing better to do than judge how others spend their money. Disregsrd other people's opinions and do what you want.
---
Let them keep repeating it, they need to convince themselves that asking 15 bucks to mom isn't necessary this time around.
---
I play it and it's fun. 
---
Sadly Bethesda can't stop to make awful decisions, they finish to kill the potential that Fallout76 had.
---
&gt;I don’t play fo76
---
Like I said, a huge amount of the people trying to fan the fire do not, and never have, played the game. If you don't play the game  why the hell are you even on a sub dedicated to it? You do see how you come off as just another troll don't you? Especially when you end your post with "the problem is you".
---
$15 dollars a month is roughly what I would have spent on Atoms regardless whenever a new bundle came into the shop. I'm not defending FO1st, in fact I'm pretty disappointed it's happened, but to say it's designed to support the "whales" isn't very accurate. Plenty of people spend $15 dollars a month (and more) to go to football games, or go drinking every weekend with their friends. A video game shouldn't be thought of any differently in that regard.
---
That's a risk BGS made, we shouldn't be paying for a mistake they made. Hardly anyone wanted a live service Fallout game. Live services are almost exclusively terrible, grindy and cheap. Look at Anthem as a recent example. Look at the Destiny games for examples of rampant monetization. If BGS didn't want to fund the game, they shouldn't have made it. If they haven't made a profit from making a selling a game, maybe they shouldn't be in the business of making and selling games.
---
Just to correct you, 76 had plenty of new assets. Of course they reused fallout 4 assets too. There's literally no reason not to. You don't scrap everything you make for a game on a new engine after it's done. Every company reuses assets. It's bad practice not to.
---
And it's cool that you love outer worlds. Doesn't make it not bland though. It's bland. But I'm glad you enjoyed the 20 or so hours of gameplay it offers.
---
&gt; The first year of any online game like this is usually ironing out the problems. 
---
So, when does the first year start?
---
Turns out this guy doesn’t play the game... he’s not really that into fallout apparently.
---
The way they have some cards are tied to certain things. Like for example with the heavy build
---
You don't get you're first PA suit till 25 (not counting raider, not viable) the lowest level heavy gun is 25 I think (.50) so it makes sense to introduce the cards around that time. You wouldn't need them any earlier anyway
---
Wait?!? It got better? I legit haven't played since the Tse nerf
---
Bethesda's launcher has always been known to do this. I thought they went about fixing it though. Don't know why we can't just have steam releases for everything, atleast that's a platform with both features and functionality.
---
TIL greedy corporations are your friend
---
"I don't play fo76" --&gt; Liberator confirmed!
---
I’ve been using razorgrain soup lately and the disease resistance is amazing combined with the well fed bonus!
---
Personally I'd rather play the pushing game and see to what point everyone says fuck it
---
good example is a shotgunner build, if i use my explosive shotty i need to repair every 30-40 shots depending on perks. by purchasing a bunch of repair kits early on i can just keep going and hotkey them. that is a distinct advantege than the player who has to stop the quest/pvp/sbq fight and go repair at either their base or somewhere with a workbench.
---
If gamers are going to be part of a movement it should be one against the console manufacturers for putting every single online game you own behind a subscription pay wall.
---
Looks like the headstone is more visible
---
You won't harm anyone. And trust me, you REALLY should not care about bothering people so disgusting to harass someone just because they have a different opinion.   
---
It's YOUR money. If you think you'd have to fun with Fallout 1st and can afford it then go ahead.  
---
If someone bothers you I suggest  justreporting for harrassment and blocking them. You can even laugh about how sad those people are with your friend after.  
---
The most negativity I got since I subscribed to 1st is someone approaching my Survival Tent and doing the Angry emote. I just replied with a Love emote and that was it.   
---
Please, don't let anyone ruin your fun.
---
That’s why I do my online gaming on the pc. I’m with you 100%
---
Oh I forgot about that vindicator from fallout 2, cool
---
If they haven't already been looted you can find cores in fusion generators across the map and in power armor that spawns.  They are not full charge but you should hopefully find enough of them to keep you rolling. I use to start at the nuka cola plant and move north to the farms.  Then hit up point pleasant and the lumber yard in the far north west.  There is also a suit at aaronholt farmstead and some fusion generators and power armor at Morgantown.
---
Well shit.
---
I subbed instantly, now I am selling hate I collect for 50c / bulk. I've got an endless stock thanks to my brand new Scrapbox (tm)!
---
I definitely understand that it’s not misunderstood people as much as it is people acting like they’re forming a revolution by hating on others. Reddit isn’t a good source of info on the game’s state. Most people that bought it bought it and most people that didn’t, didnt. Few peoples’ experiences make it seem like there’s a war going on
---
If you don't play fo76 and you aren't into ANY of the fallout games WTF are you even doing in this subreddit? This sub is toxic enough without people who have no interest in the entire franchise adding to it.
---
You're factually correct, and we had the term pay2progress, but pay2win goes off the tongue more easily, and it's more emotional and it's apparent from the word that it's a bad thing. I've explained p2w to countless idiots but then they'll still defend it because "it's not that bad", "your game didn't change (second class citizen)", "you can still grind for it" etc. or they just make fun of you for being too poor to afford it.
---
repair kits weigh nothing mate. do you play?
---
It wont end here tho. This is a new era of Fallout76. Thank you subscribers for supporting this amazing service . There's more to come so hold on to your seat. 
---
Because mods deleted my post twice (fck you mods) here it is as a comment:
---
Ok guys, so my friend from Zimbabwe recently got hired by the big B as a scrap box operator (more about that in a moment). He was able to smuggle out some Wastelanders patch notes and Bethesda representative statements on the future of Fallout 1st. Bethesda recently upgraded the database servers drives from 5-inch floppy discs to 8-inch floppy discs for security reasons (obviously, the larger floppy disc is harder to smuggle through security checkpoints) so it wasn't easy to get it but my friend managed to hide it well.   Anyway, here it is!
---
# Fallout 1st created jobs - a word about scrap limit controversy
---
Greetings Vault dwellers! Before we talk about the future of Fallout 76, we'd like to address your concerns about the scrap box limit. Yes, we did say that increasing the scrap limit will have a huge effect on server performance and we stand by that statement, however, with the most recent advances in computer technology, our world-class engineers were able to come up with a solution. Unfortunately, bringing what everyone asked for came with a price. Here's how it works in nutshell: Each scrap box is actually a mini server running on ATARI 65XE system. It's totally separate from the main server and it's operated by a real person that keeps track of all your transfers on an excel spreadsheet which later gets transferred to a designated server. As mentioned earlier, for security reasons all transfers between the main server and your personal scrap box mini server are done manually via 8-inch floppy discs. This basically means that every time a new player subscribes to Fallout 1st, we hire a personal scrap box accountant just for you. Your improved Fallout experience improves the lives of people in developing countries by giving them jobs. High five! 
---
We want to be totally transparent with our fanbase so here's a breakdown of the Fallout1st subscription costs:
---
* **$2 USD - Personal scrap box accountant monthly wage ($723.800**  
---
  **Zimbabwean dollars)**
---
* **$9,99 - MS Office subscription**
---
* **$1.00 - 2 floppy discs (discs are archived each month)**
---
**Total price $12.99**
---
The cost of mini servers is on us because YOU DESERVE IT!
---
# Introducing, Fallout 1st Plus
---
In our wildest dreams, we didn't expect such great sales of Fallout1st! This made us understand how far this community is able to go to improve the Fallout experience. You've voted with your wallets and we heard you. With the launch of  Wastelanders, we're excited to announce Fallout 1st Plus! This new $60 a month subscription will make you feel like you're buying a brand new fallout game every month, and let me tell you, it's worth it!
---
Key features:
---
* You've asked and we're delivering! A radio host is coming to West Virginia. This new radio channel called RADIO PLUS will be available to ALL Fallout 1st plus subscribers.
---
* For a more immersive experience, we've added ads between every song to all pre-wastelanders radio channels. For now, the only ad will be fallout1st plus ad, but we're working on getting more ads on board. RADIO PLUS is add-free.
---
* Expanded camp budget! All Fallout 1st plus subscribers will enjoy a double camp budget. To balance out the server stability, non-subscribers can no longer place C.A.M.P. Don't worry freeloaders, we wouldn't leave you without a home! We're rewarding all non-subscribers with a hobo tent, created in collaboration with the designers behind the TIBIA mmo game. 
---
* Camp priority! Have you ever stumbled upon a perfect base spot, just for it to be already taken by a non-subscriber? No worries! With Fallout 1st Plus, you're the boss! Simply place your C.A.M.P and that pesky freeloader's hobo tent will get packed up automatically, leaving the spot for you, because you deserve it!
---
* Wastelanders NPC hub city was designed with performance in mind. We've introduced queuing for cities and shops. While fallout1st plus subscribers can enjoy service priority and no queues at main entrances, non-subscribers will have to use backdoor and line up in a queue for performance reasons.   
---
* All ally and enemy NPCs will address Fallout1st Plus subscribers with proper respect. Select from titles such as Lord, Sir, Madam, Boss, Duke, Emperor, Empress, and Hero.
---
* Introducing odor system! A swarm of flies will gather around players who do not take a bath for a day. Shop owners will increase their prices for smelly players because immersion. You can purchase a single-use vault-tec soap in the atom shop for 1000 atoms. All Fallout 1st Plus subscribers get a new Squeaky Clean mutation, which keeps you clean at all times. 
---
* Mods on official servers for Fallout 1st P....
---
This is where the info cuts off because the floppy disc was out of space. 
---
**My take on it:**  Listen, I don't support this practice, but I can't wait to pay them and post topics on Reddit about how greatly my Fallout 76 experience has improved since I subscribed. 
---
IMPORTANT NOTE: This leak is unconfirmed so please take it with a grain of salt.
---
ranger armor was made pre war it was used as riot armor
---
Lol too late, I bought the entire bundle
---
I’m, curious are you still playing the game?
---
Is it NCR branded though?
---
&gt; Staffing isn't an issue let's be serious
---
Additionally, gamedev is an area of software development where you are in no way short of passionate devs willing to bend over a little for their dream job, above the more soul-crushing webdev type gig. Especially for a company with TES and Fallout which might have played a role in getting those people into dev in the first place, especially via modding.
---
You're not entirely wrong but I wouldn't say OW is scripted. The dialog and questing is generally good to great, but the moment-to-moment exploration gameplay is kind of awful and boring. There's no reason to explore, enemies and NPC's are largely stagnant at all hours of the day, and the combat feels off to me, at least on my One X.
---
Oh, and the One X version also runs like dog shit. It physically hurts me to look at the screen sometimes. I think it's 4k 30fps, maybe? If that's the case then I wish we were at least given the option to turn the game down to 1080p/60fps because right now it is rough.
---
Still, though, it's a great foundation for future titles. I'm excited to see where Obsidian goes from here with that newfound Microsoft money.
---
The reason gamers hate me is because they can't afford it.
---
People don't care at this point. Nuke mines still kill you, even with passive, and the folks doing it don't care who you are, or how nice you are, it's to make a point to Bethesda, and to the people supporting 1st. Been reading several feeds about it over the last 12 hours.
---
The guy who posted this doesn't play fo76 he admitted to not even being a fan of the fallout games.
---
Have you tried subscribing to Fallout 1st? Only US$100 per year (Best Value!)
---
Server stability cannot be guaranteed for users playing on public servers.
---
Why would anyone hate you? its your money, you can trow it anywhere you like, even if it is on the trash that is this game. If you realy wanna play this game with your friend and pay a sub to do it, well, may god have mercy on your soul.
---
Do you feel hate towards those guys that would spend actualy money to fuck those disgusting fat grandma hookers? No, right, its more like pity isnt it? well, thats kinda how i see you.
---
Ha! A bunch of outraged Karen's demanding to speak to the managers
---
no its branded L.A.P.D the L.R is covered by the jacket
---
Unicorn_splosion
---
&gt; Then Bethesda decides to shit the bed in spectacular fashion by ending the Nuclear Winter phase with a limp (crappy display cases, delayed Legendary progression, failed vault raid)
---
I haven't been following too closely and haven't heard of this, could you elaborate or point me somewhere?
---
Oh alright. Well then I suppose it's not so bad then.
---
Do whatever you want with your own money and don't worry about what other people say or think. I personally would never buy the sub, because I feel that for me it sends the wrong message out that Bethesda can conduct their business in this manner. But I would gladly play with someone who pays for the sub and would never flame him for it(Unless i mess around with close friends). If you feel the sub is worth the money and you can afford it, then the more power to you. Enjoy your stay in the wasteland.
---
No, I ended up playing most of level 80-100 just to get the platinum trophy, which I did about Monday or Tuesday and I was glad for a break because it’d become so boring. The purveyor sale made me realise I’m just trying to marginally improve my loadout when the only actual challenge is the imposter SS, everything else is easy. I really enjoy the CAMP building so I went back to FO4 with mods, and now a The Outer Worlds is out, I won’t be back till wastelanders at least. How about you? What’s your take on it?
---
When the entire game revolves around collecting junk and crafting? Yeah having infinite storage is paying to win. Your problem, is that you define "winning" solely by how easily you can kill another player.
---
But more scrap means more/better weapons, more repairs, more healing, more storage for weapons and gear means better selection to what you fight with.
---
The only thing you think is pay to win, is higher stats. And that's willfully obtuse, and intellectually dishonest.
---
Your $100-150 gives you a distinct advantage over someone who doesn't. Not just a different way of playing. A *vastly easier* way of playing. And nothing stops you from building up a character, coming to public servers, mopping up on people, and retreating back to a world with no competition to regroup.
---
*Surviving is winning*. And if you have advantages in surviving, that you paid for, you are paying to win.
---
It's an experiment alright.
---
And you are completely full of shit.
---
Why do we still play this game?  All the BS and still nothing to do but grind out the same things I've been grinding out for a year now....like rats in a maze
---
Ahh, a maytr. Downvoted because they don't like what you said because it completely ignores every counter to their statement to pretend their point is still valid.
---
I am still skeptical about the in game targeting claims. I and everyone I know that has the service hasn't been bothered by anyone in public worlds. 
---
Every interaction I've had is players checking out the ranger outfit and giving a heart emote or thumbs up. 
---
Every day I see more players with the outfit, emblem, or emotes. 
---
The only hate I come across is on here.
---
Great work!
---
This is all new to me. I’m a lifelong gamer and follow the news. I knew this game was going to be a shitstorm and dammit it is. I’m quite sure this sub is SUPER toxic, for that I have no doubt. 
---
You have to understand, from an outsiders perspective, this is one of the most interesting things in gaming news history that I can think of. 
---
One, the fact that in the midst of the shitstorm that is fallout 76 with how the game is viewed publicly, for them to the  release this subscription ... from an outsiders perspective, this was business suicide!!
---
But then you realize that people actually spent money on the subscription... that’s why I’m here. I’m so perplexed that anyone would pay for it that I feel the need to study you. How many of you are out there? I feel like I need to know.
---
No you won’t get hate. The people that do go around hating and being annoying would find another reason, even if you wasn’t FO1st player. Some people just get off on being idiots. I’ve not had any hate and I’m on os4 and I’d say that most ppl I’ve seen are FO1st members as they do the emotes it have a scrap box. And let’s face it what can they actually do to you, nothing.
---
Think it might be the difference between weapon drawn and stowed walks
---
You seem big mad hold that double negative karma
---
&gt;You know there is one executive pushing for this shit
---
[At least 8](https://www.zenimax.com/about) I'd say.
---
I love how with all the whiners here, they ban together and downvote you lol. The babies need to just quit and leave the space on the feed for trading and real topics. Not their crying feed
---
You can take that tribal "us vs. them" nonsense and show yourself to the door.
---
Pharma-farma (luck) perk. You will never be short of stimpacks again. It's also a pretty decent source of supplementary income. I'm on PC and I have such a steady flow of them that I'm constantly giving them away to low level chars. What platform are you on?
---
this game is dying anyway..so many peiple quitting
---
I can afford it too, but if someone took a dump and put a price tag of 100 dollars on it, I’m not going to buy it just because I can afford it.
---
It’s called “principles”.
---
A lot of people did though, don't get smart
---
The "win" part doesn't literally mean "winning the game". Any ingame advantage counts, no matter if you can also grind for it or how bad it is.
---
Don't worry about what others think, if you've considered your options and decided it's the right thing to do then yes
---
I imagine that this would be the norm. I imagine it’s people who have huge friend lists and what not would experience these problems. Or perhaps they just get unlucky.
---
I think it’s time I officially unsub from this Reddit and let any hope I had of seeing the “wow guys everything is amazing now!” posts die. 
---
How badly can someone fuck up repeatedly and continue to be accepted by their community. RIP 76, you were doomed  to a slow agonizing death at the start but you tried to claw your way out of the grave, then whoever made this choice  just had to go and empty a dump truck back on you.
---
Yes, and it's going to be the same people complaining about it who swore last week they were uninstalling.
---
It's the same game experience as before fallout first released. They didn't make it harder to gain anything, or take anything away
---
It just works!
---
While it is tribal, that is not sufficient to reject the idea and what’s happening here. Why would you want me to leave for presenting an idea for discussion?
---
I'm confused why you think my text has been removed. It has not been, as far as I can tell.
---
Yeah, what this guy said.
---
Have you tried storing it and placing it again? Does the robot being stuck actually stop it from collecting scrap in the bin or does it just bug you having him stuck? I've never had this happen and I'm curious about both.
---
Well no one asked you to buy it, no need to whine about it either.
---
GTA online has been going strong forever because all the content is attainable through gameplay. Shark cards make it more convenient but if you want to grind you can still get what you want. The players get free updates to keep them interested and rockstar is making a killing.
---
That's cool it sure seems Bethesda has gimped the private servers spawns when you get on a "new" server and almost every magazine bobble head cap stash and nukes machine are empty and it also sucks when you find out this the way I did which was running into long freezes on crafting menus and almost impossible to navigate fighting due to lag just to find out I can't log into a server with better latency unless I go public on my first free day with first membership
---
This is the CPD  riot police armor
---
Those spawns are not quaranteed spawns. There is still a chance that nothing spawns in their spot. 
---
Every private world I start is random on which mag, cap stash, or bobblehead location will spawn one. 
---
Just keep trying man. You'll luck out.
---
What’s a liberator? I’m new to this sub.
---
I’m guessing it means I’m trying to free people from fallout 76 or something? I dunno.
---
Not being forced to buy anything.  Fully awake.  Support your right to choose.
---
Vending machine have everything you need. Just be patient and shop.
---
Gotcha. Haven't seen it. Just assumed it was typical NCR ranger armor
---
You care how I or how others spend their money? That 10x worse in my book.
---
Don't be obtuse in place of a real argument.
---
Yes comrade!  Release the Liberators and well win this class war against those reprehensible Bougoise Ameri-kans.
---
[citation needed]
---
I... don't know if you understand my logic, actually. What I'm saying is a lesson we learned early on from children's books like "If you give a mouse a cookie". Bethesda is the mouse. Accepting or brushing off this Fallout 1st sub model is the cookie. Obviously I can't predict what's going to 100% happen, but logic dictates that people pay for this, Bethesda will think they can get away with making us pay for more, and then you DO start getting paid DLC, and such.
---
That is awesome you guys are great!
---
OR... This subscription service could be almost identical to one that is already in a game that had been relatively successful (ESO) and now they're trying it here...
---
Hope so cause right now it seems I have 100x better luck on public servers.
---
Find a power armor spawn (the town with the airport to the right of vault 76 has 2 really close spawns, can't remember the name of it though) and keep collecting the fusion cores from them and server hop and collect the fusion cores from those ones. Best way in my opinion
---
If this is true, I'm willing to bet the player base spiked because of the patch and the free servers before learning how to access the servers. Pops always spike during patch weeks. 
---
How much were *retained* is the important part.
---
It is funny, even as a long time Bethesda fan.  This is basically Horse Armor (but worse) all over again.  I get that Zenimax is trying to change their revenue model, but the Atom shop and this Fallout 1st is nothing short of a huge fuck up.  It is inexcusable.
---
I would venture to say RDR2 and GTA. 
---
Vehicle (horses included) is a very complex system to master within a game world. There are hundreds of NPCs. Both game worlds are very large and exceptionally detailed. Also, they can host 32 players. 
---
Fallout 76 takes the cake in terms of item itemization but what you see and what the database holds is very different. Sure there are lots of models, but it’s more or less just holding the number of scrap within a database. 
---
All three games have many weapons with mods.
---
Some people have a smoother, less bugged, better working version of Fallout. Like, a decently working version of the game. 
---
The rest, peasants, have to settle with their 60 dollars beta.
---
100% same experience
---
I got the sub on day one and my scrapbox has worked great the entire time.
---
Desert Rangers also existed long before the NCR out west. One of the companions in Fallout 1 is dressed as one and claims his grandfather was a ranger. So it’s not as anachronistic as some people might think.
---
Bethesda out here realising they not making any money - cash grab time!
---
That sounds so much like those p2w scabs. P2w players are arguing that their paid advantages don't affect other players in any way, and then they would get mad if they if they had them too.
---
If they'd told me when I bought it that instead of being $70, it would be $370...I may have thought twice about buying it.
---
Pretty sure you can't sue someone just because you are angry you had to pay for something someone else didn't.
---
You're 100% right about that. Though, if the game was really as dead as people on this sub wants it to be, Bethesda wouldn't bother continuing with content. They're still slaves to corporate money. 
---
I hope there isn't anyone here who actually believes they'd keep a negative income product out just to spite them.
---
There is me and another friend who is active nearly everyday on fallout 76, I have two characters one messy level 75 and one bloodied build I’m working on currently who is level 32, we are always welcoming new people to come join our squad.
---
My PSN is x_1Caso
---
Oh boy I remember people like you saying the same, self-assuring affirmations back when microtransactions were taking off. You may want to look around. We are officially at *the bottom* of the slippery slope.
---
I’m going to play Fallout 76 with my friends and have fun while you guys fight a video game company.
---
Oh I didn't know that. I haven't played the first 2 games very much.
---
Keep shopping various vendors on various servers.  Have come across Fixers frequently for sale at reasonable prices.
---
Nah I think as long as the title doesn't spoil and is tagged as spoiler.
---
Let me guess:
---
No: You don't even play so what does it matter.
---
Yes: If it's so bad why are you still playing?
---
they screwed us over once already, only a matter of time until it happens again.
---
The game utility I’m referring to is unlimited scrap storage and a secondary mobile camp.
---
I've been finding them on private worlds. Hang in there.
---
Bland? Compared to FO76? 
---
In that comparison you are far off.    I tried being the bad guy. Ended up making a decision that ended up seemingly good in the first part of the story... That level of grey is beautiful.
---
Also... 24 hours is if you rush through and skip dialogue and side quests.  Like you can beat zelda:botw in a few hours if you rush the game. Doesn't mean there's nothing else to do after beating the main mission.
---
"A more realistic estimate for how long it takes to beat The Outer Worlds is 40 hours. This would be enough time to complete most of the side quests and engage in most of the dialogue options. This, however, is still not an estimate for leaving no stone unturned.".  That is worth it to me.  I'll play through it twice with different options taken.
---
Fr that's actually super handy lol thanks for showing me
---
When people pay for this garbage it tells the company it's ok and they will do it again. They made a multiplayer game that everyone wanted private, then charge us to make it private and people celebrate "see now its private" it's a bait a switch tactic. You think they listened and are happy to give them money because it what you wanted, when they should have done that all along. And if not, then there is no right to charge MORE than the GAME COST! For that feature. And the feature isn't permanent. 
---
I do loose, because I bought a game that didn't deliver on it's promises. I loose because games will continue to pull this crap. If no one had to pay a cent and they then chose to play solo, I'd say God bless them.  But hey maybe I enjoyed the multiplayer aspect. Now it will be LESS so because people will go off in their own world. I loose again.
---
People also say it lags the game big time.
---
If you can get a handle of the game’s mechanics (going from Bethesda’s Fallouts to the original is a huge difference), the stories are phenomenal.
---
I would rather buy V Bucks than Fallout 1st.
---
Ah the old "you poor" BS defense. I spent $60 on The Outer Worlds. A complete, bug free game better than anything Bethesda could hope to make. You spent $100 on a game you already bought for almost the same. Just to collect garbage a little easier. 
---
And you're actually bragging?
---
I could buy ten subs right now. Just because the money is in my pocket, doesn't make the purchase smart.
---
Welcome to America where people sue anyone for anything. Someone would try it if Bethesda gave F2P players the P2W items...I know they would.
---
Last I checked this post was 29m ago not 3-6 months
---
Lol.  Stuff is so prevalent you'd have to give it away for free.
---
Just explore any old city/settlement area and youre guaranteed to find cans of dog food.
---
Most of the new quests have some kind of presence at the train stations.  Look at the walls for posters you can read.
---
Oh man, if Cyberpunk 2077 is even half competently produced, it'll provide a stark reminder of how far Bethesda have fallen.
---
100 dollars is taken away and given to a greedy lying company. If nothing has changed then why did they pay said money.
---
Then I would be glad to sell you stimpaks tomorrow because now I'm going to sleep.
---
Psn: Weezunder
---
I'm curious as well. Maybe he's running around in an empty chassis? Other than that I can't see why someone under level 25 would need fusion cores either (not to mention that damn things are heavy) Anyone 25 and up should be able to solo Poseidon relatively quickly (unless they have a terrible sense of direction because it can be pretty easy to get lost in those damn power plants)
---
Ikr? Ive had the rare crash but nothing short of whats mentioned in reddit. OP musn't be old enough to know of other game launches which have been far worse. Funcom anyone? Even GTA V had a shaky start, in fact it didnt work for me from launch and I had to tweak my PC so it would run.
---
The OP doesnt play the game and yet offers an opinion lmao. Theres a reason people are buying the sub. It obviously holds value to some. 
---
P.s. OP. I personally wear my armor/icons in the hope that someone tries to grief me.
---
Remember all the “backlash” about Captain Marvel? That movie broke box office records. Outrage is entertainment for some people.
---
I'm not actually a subscriber so idk what you're getting at.
---
I'm just pointing out the flaws in OPs plan. Plus Bethesda just won't do it.
---
I played for several hours today without paying for private servers. Believe it or not the game worked and I enjoyed it.
---
I've had plenty of posts over the last few days stating very clearly that none has the right to tell me how I spend my money. In this case, the ludicrous verbiage of the post I replied to honestly made me laugh out loud. In case you hadn't noticed a huge portion of the people posting here don't,  and never have, played the game. The trolls are out in force so having a "real argument" is absolutely pointless,  at least for now. Soon enough the mob will burn itself out and then, for those that actually play, we can get back to debating on the merits
---
&gt; I’d rather have you at my camp buying ammo I crafted from my unlimited budget scrap box than your upvotes anyway.
---
Woah, save some pussy for the rest of us.
---
Just wondering why the OP was still playing if you think it’s sh**???
---
Gone on my end.
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/MH0EzTD
---
I’m over level 200 in 76, I love the game and have only experienced minor bugs like the power armor visual glitch.
---
Dont let the internet trolls dictate what you're going to do.  If you really want to play with your buds in a private world, go ahead and do it.
---
I won't disagree with their opinions either, but either way everyone had the same ability to access those features. Now the only way to access these new features is pay. It's a whole new ball game. Pay wall
---
You’re a shitty little robot that nobody likes. Go away.
---
No shit, we're officially at the bottom of about ten slippery slopes at this point.
---
I got them both a while back for purchasing 76, but they're just so different to play I haven't made it very far lol
---
&gt; clearly not worth it.
---
Says you. So don't buy it. Why shit on people who do find it worth it for them?
---
&gt; unlisted stash
---
What does this even mean
---
&gt; that deletes your items
---
Was rare, and has been fixed.
---
&gt; threw a party you'd probably have more fun
---
$100 doesn't fund much of a party, and it would be a few hours' fun, not a year's worth.
---
100% agree. This is just internet nonsense.
---
I’d say it’s way smaller than that unless you include all the subs together. 
---
It’s an amazing community as a whole with a few bad apples that we read about more than many see.
---
I understand but p2w doesnt apply to the "single player" aspects of the game. Pvp is the o lu way a p2w feature would apply. Now if they sold a package  with a complete set of assasins/blend with the environment/ we heavy combat armor and a BEFFR handmade, now that would be pay to win. Do you see the difference? Being able to put up a temporary  tent isnt p2w. Being able to have 4 million pieces of bone scrap doesnt make me invincible or harder to kill.
---
So by the logic of people that claim p2w, if I get into a pvp encounter over a workshop with someone that doesnt have the fallout 1st subscription, I should be invincible and always win correct? Even with a level 1 pipe pistol.
---
People pre-bought the game, they received money before finishing the game and I think they are not a Kickstarter little business, since they must have some resources left from other games, such as Skyrim, Fallout 4, etc.
---
And even then, the game was released fuckedup enough to feel like Beta. But we love Fallout, so we showed some love and were patient. 
---
Now they need more money and the game works better, but only for those who pay extra.
---
If Fallout 76 Is this small, player-sustained game which survives only if we pay them monthly, then maybe, it should stop working. I love the game, but many of us feel cheated on, and we are running out of patience.
---
Taken? People willingly pay for a service and get things they want... nothing is taken. 
---
Name a company that doesn’t want to make any money? I’ll wait...
---
I still haven't had any luck in finding a server where these can be harvested. Have you?
---
Someone else made a post really similar to this about 20 minutes ago and they got ripped a new one for how entitled they came across. 
---
I’m sure this won’t happen to you... but for sure people loooooove being told how to spend their own money.
---
So *your* enjoyment comes at the expense of damaging the game other people enjoy just to make it easier for you. Your enjoyment comes from damaging the industry by sending a message that this type of scummy monetization is ok. Your enjoyment is more important than thousands of other players. See how that lame fallacy stuff works? Anyone can do it. Try harder.
---
&gt;While it is tribal, that is not sufficient to reject the idea
---
Sure it is.  It's called arguing in bad faith.
---
If your rhetorical adversary is more interested in sowing division, as you clearly are, there is no point in debate because you demonstrate no willingness to entertain any viewpoint other than your own.
---
I bought the dump and I love playing with it
---
Don't get me wrong private servers are a great idea and paying a little bit for a truly private do whatever you want with it server like in minecraft is totally fine. But that's not at all what FO76's are so.
---
lul thinking theres still gonna be a year 4 /5
---
I mean they deserve it
---
Go join a political campaign if you want to defeat capitalism
---
It costs more than my Netflix and Spotify subscriptions. So wouldn't call it "dirt cheap" !
---
Did anybody make it past the second paragraph in this post before they got bored and gave up? As I was reading it right around the end of  2nd paragraph my brain refused to keep reading and just started saying blah blah blah blah blah so I gave up
---
We are fortunate for grow on the garden of Eden, on garden of Eden there are more green plants that dead toxic plants.

Oh and talking about Eden... HERE'S YOUR PRESIDENT JOHN HENRY... HAHA I WAS JOKING IT'S ME THREEEEEE DOOOOGGG.
---
I’m not a fan of the fallout 1st. But I don’t go around trolling other people. If you bought it, fine. Your money, no judgement. But if you hate someone because they made a choice you don’t like, you’re the real asshole. And if you troll someone in game about it, you’re an even bigger one. Let them spend their goddamn money how they want.
---
If you truly *hate* somebody over a game subscription, i suggest you put down the contoller, get off the couch and take a nice long walk while you think about whats really going on with your life.
---
Thank goodness you're here to pick up the slack, and fill that quota.
---
Yeah that doesn't surprise me lol that's alright. And hey I'm not telling anyone how to spend their money, I can't stop them, I'm just saying there's going to be consequences they haven't thought of and they can have fun spending A LOT of money further down the road just to access their game.
---
So I spent the last few days farming lead, steel, and acid. I went and spent all my caps on plans I didn't have, then loaded up a vendor with 5000 5.56 ammo, and tonnes of other ammo for 1c a piece, I took over a Fusion Core workshop and farmed those for a while, put those into the vendor at 100c a piece, then went into adventure today, I have over 9K caps now. 
---
Also got a 3\* explosive handmade rifle, yeah, I'm cool with this sub service, best 99 bucks I've spent on a game.
---
What are you talking about? Its the exact same scenario as EA a few years back. And guess what? EA is still around making games and people are still buying them.
---
Your post is pathetic. Couldnt give a rats ass about the waste of oxygen put into 'hate' just because someone purchased something they dont agree with.
---
I really do hope someone trys and griefs me, or if I see it in game against another, my legacy weapons will know what to do. Also, theres several ways to get around the passive modes in pvp (you would know because you dont play but follow the 'gaming news' right?) so there no hiding for any griefer.
---
If nothing has changed why did you pay $100 more, for no change?
---
I’ve personally gotten T-51b and T-60 plans from Distant Thunder. I can also confirm T-60 plans come from cranberry bog treasure maps as for T-51b I’m not sure where they drop as I don’t do many treasure maps.
---
Well said. if I could \*give reddit gold\*
---
In game it's a small annoying robot mass produced by Red-Chinese-Communists to infiltrate the United States,  be annoying and blindly repeat the communist propaganda its communist masters feed it.  In the game they angrily shout Manadarin sounding gibberish at players while being annoying but not much of a threat.
---
Spoiler alert: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Liberator
---
I like that EA you worked in, there!
---
I never said for good, but I don't think I'm coming back unless Wastelanders is god in DLC form (like that would happen lol) or someone reverse engineers the game and makes an open source implementation of the servers.
---
Everyone I get in a discussion about it say "hey why do you care what others do with their money" and "doesn't affect you" they will never get through their heads what you and I are saying. if they think it's ok decision to pay $100 for this crap, they'll never comprehend what we are saying. It's so frustrating
---
Save your blood packs and tick blood.  Easily turned into stimpacks.
---
Third one always gets me. They think they're so smart lol
---
You can tell how spiteful these people are by downvoting anyone who manages to burst their bubble over this game. Good on you, dude. Your family is lucky. I'm sure your family is very proud of you.
---
You've never played the game and don't like fallout games. You're just here to spread hate about a game you know nothing about. I have a feeling most of the shit posts on here a from people just like you.
---
I might. I decided to nuke a couple areas and have found more locations for the strangler blooms. It turns violet so it makes it easy to spot in the trees. 
---
Let me see how it goes and I'll message you with some locations.
---
It doesn’t make anyone better or increase their chances of being better or winning anything. 
---
There’s a reason why the community asked for private servers... no ones talking about that... 
---
Paywall... no one really isn’t talking about players literally making cash and a lot of it! Ever check out eBay sales or Gameflip? Tens of Thousand a day... no one complaining even though it violates TOS... no posts of players being upset... hmmm... guess that’s all ok with people... q
---
What they were doing before: nothing.
---
&gt; I don’t see 76 recovering from this
---
Come on man, if you think a stupid subscription for more stash and another fast travel point is gonna kill a game, you need to re-evaluate how many people have the same thought process as you.
---
A lot of people don’t care about selling. A lot of people don’t care about SBQ killing techniques. A lot of people don’t give a shit about “automatic scrapping”... and so this doesn’t affect them at all. This will not kill the game, in fact I read somewhere that there was actually a surge of players after 1st was released.
---
How the hell does that deserve a down vote? Lol
---
You think the HK outrage is based around reddit? LOL
---
You'd find a reason not to friend
---
 &gt; Do you spend money on your hobbies?
---
Context is a real pain when you're trying to defend something indefensible.
---
I wanna say T51 comes from either mire or savage divide maps
---
He said gameplay content would be free.
---
Anything that changes how you interact with the world is gameplay content.
---
Scrapboxes, the fridge, the tent, etc fit that description.
---
I’m all about helping players out... I’ve made more low level upgrades deep pocketed leather armor than I can remember, all my water and collectron is unlocked and don’t mind people taking it, camo is open. 
---
I also see a lot of others helping also! Pretty cool!
---
Ahhhhhh, yet another non-76 player come to tell us how we are ruining their games. Well, hate to break it to you but the sub appears to be a pretty big hit. Severs have been pretty damn full and I'd guess fully 2/3 are sporting the ranger outfit or rocking the emotes. In a nutshell,  the sub is already a success. I, for instance,  got so annoyed with all these people who don't even play the game coming into a sub dedicated to said game, telling us how we should or should not spend our own money, that I'm changing my sub from monthly to the annual. The most hilarious part is,  after looking at their profiles, the vast majority do play games with subs, MTX and loot boxes. The absolute height of hypocrisy
---
Move the station.  The collectron will reset and pop out of the charging station like nothing happened.
---
It helps you identify the whales.
---
The reality is though, making these big white knight kind of statements doesn’t do anything. It’s a polarising issue, so some people will agree and some won’t, but your not going to change anyone’s mind buddy. Your just fanning the flames. 
---
Voting with your wallet is the only thing you can do... but calling people out in this kind of way just don’t work buddy’s it’s the internet, no one wins arguments on the internet 😂
---
A whale is someone who spends an abnormal amount of money on a game. Being "a hobby" is not some ironclad defense against selling out to some company that treats you like garbage every chance they get.
---
Hey there sorry to intervene but if u still have the masks i am willing to buy both of em or at least one.Send me a friend request next time u're in the game and if u're on PC as well.The ign is Sierra117Enclave.
---
Other subs have this issue happening too.
---
I think he's got a point here. We need to work on our collective definition of p2w.
---
All those single player freemium games with stamina bars and gems and whatnot, I would absolutely consider p2w. So if multiplayer isn't part of the definition, then single player dlc would constitute p2w, yet I would never classify it as such as it doesn't come with the typical problems around it (such as making your game intentionally annoying to force players to remove that annoyance by paying).
---
Oh I thought you got the gun too
---
Well there good at breaking promises but only if it  gives them instant cash so I don't think so
---
We're not paying for their mistake, we're literally supposed to be paying for the continued development of the game though.  
---
That's why the atom shop exists.  Live service games have to find ways to monetize in order to support the indefinite development cycle that regular games don't have to deal with.  Some games use loot boxes, some sell battle passes, some sell access to their dlc and expansions and some have subscription services for access but they all have to find a way to continue making money.  
---
Stop acting as if Bethesda trying to sell cosmetics or access to minor conveniences is somehow worse than ANY other game is doing.  If Bethesda wanted to squeeze their players for every cent they could do be doing FAR worse things to this game.
---
Maybe look for a YouTube video with audio of someone doing the dance.  Right click on the video, copy video URL, then go to ytmp3.cc to convert it to a downloadable MP3 for free. I know that's not exactly what you asked but it's a way to get the audio if you can find a video of someone doing the dance.
---
I already stated multiple times in this thread, im a firm believer of “you do you” and “if you like it, enjoy it.” I’m not one of those people going in public servers and doing anything, I don’t even play the game.
---
I’m offering the perspective of why your community is getting the hate that it is. And I want a discussion.
---
Talk to me. What is it like being in your shoes? I can’t say that I’ve ever been apart of a community that is hated like the fallout76 community is hated. 
---
If the world was just the gaming community, the gaming community looks at fallout 76 players almost with disgust, like they are pedophiles or something. It’s completely ridiculous! The things people say about y’all is over the top.
---
I’m not one of those haters. I don’t care enough, I’m playing the few games I play and enjoy myself. Which is why I say, “you do do”.
---
I'm 99.999% sure they weight 1?
---
Careful, Bethesda might turn this list into Fallout 2nd
---
Are there even any, outside the Powerplants?
---
Wow.. it does make them better. Even if I'd agree with you on that, people are talking about that we asked for private servers and they give it to us half assed. 7 friends and no control? That's a private session not private server. 
---
People making cash has ZERO to do with a pay wall. Pay wall means I can't go there unless I pay. People making money is a complete separate issue.
---
If this game has ruined your life so badly, might I suggest you get a lawyer and sue Bethesda for damages? You're literally screaming into the void here. 
---
I get it, you feel they lied to you, they've destroyed your faith in humanity, your dog ran away because of it, and it's somehow made you impotent (sorry, didn't read your rant) 
---
You all keep screaming that this is a broken game, I've had the server crash on me once in the last 6 months. And 1st, makes it even less laggy. Frankly 76 works better than GTAV.
---
Nah they went to the effort to change the writing on the front to make it lore friendly
---
If you know anything about the lore around workers being replaced with robots in Appalachia, you learn that most of the riots were centered at Charleston. 
---
Meaning they would technically have riot gear/ ranger armor.
---
Depends on what you're going for: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/htmlview#
---
Thanks, hit up NightinGery#8190 on discord for recruitment info
---
Yeah so can Bethesda. Difference is, you'll pay for it when they do it.
---
PA and fusion generators.  Assuming somebody hasnt already taken them.
---
I dislike several factors about Fallout 1st (mainly locking QoL additions behind a paywall) but I don’t see how I or anyone else can tell the community it isn’t worth the money. It’s literally worth the monetary value if you wanted the atoms and nothing else. My problem is more of a matter of principle.  I think 1st is the slipperiest of slopes, and I wouldn’t touch it based on that principle, but I don’t think anyone who be evaluating it’s worth to someone else. Hope you can see where I’m coming from and at least respectfully disagree.
---
This happened to many (myself included) at 76's launch, search it up
---
You're in the dark.
---
It takes an exceptionally whiney bitch to cry about a game that they don't even play.
---
I didn’t know that. That’s cool though, thanks man. I never got into the fallout games, but I respect the series. I wish I had more time but I never had the right moment to invest in any fallout game.
---
You do get your own brand new instance and Bethesda has released a statement on it. It wouldnt be fair if non private servers couldnt get instant respawning loot either? Imagine the salt if that happened.
---
If youve ever server hopped looking for an elusive plan etc, you would see how the server treats loot spawns and just spawns in general. 
---
I admit its humorous reading posts claiming you dont get  a new server or its a recycled one. Thats damn funny.
---
E: hint: when you server hop into an area muliple times you can look at the contents of a stash box to see if your plan/object has spawned. If you dont touch the contents it will respawn if you server hop. If you loot it however, it will not appear until the refresh timer has reset. Some 'world' objects behave in this manner too.
---
I think companies and gov'ts often buddy up enough that they ask and it's always OK.
---
 Or more likely....somebody stole your account.
---
No ones jealous of your virtual garbage can LOL, and i doubt ANYONE is jealous that you spent 100$ on pure trash
---
Imo, the jokes on you fool
---
I’m not whining, trust me. I’m more perplexed that anyone would spend money on the pass. I want to study y’all.
---
This whole game is about survival. If you can survive easier, you're winning. If you pay for it, you're paying to win.
---
Same, I farm script too. I use the scrap box just for junk so I can make room for some legendary weapons I have.
---
The game itself is an opponent. Or if we're using your logic. Other players.
---
What do you mean the $12 subscription is cheaper?
---
These things should also all be free
---
I never said I didn't like it. I do. It just doesn't live up to the hype people gave it, nor do I think it deserves this weird praise it gets as though it's the first good rpg in ages and is single handedly "saving player one". "It's a good game, not an incredible one." I've said those words basically all day.
---
Actual constructive criticism. Well done! I paid for a month of the subscription, but I agree that all of these would have been better, and far more equitable.
---
You, yourself stated it's just AAA games now. Bethesda isn't the first company to do this but matter of fact they've been pay gating content since 2006.
---
This problem is far bigger then fo76. Gaming is moving to a subscription base service Xbox whatever PlayStation now ea access. Ubisoft play etc etc and on top of that mtx. (Yes I know the names might be off).
---
Idk man, golden years of gaming are long gone. Maybe we just gotta stop playing games.
---
If there is no advantage why did you pay $100 for a game you already bought?
---
It's police riot armor.
---
Easier survival in a survival game.
---
...but the first year is almost over and it doesn’t look like they „ironed out the problems“. I would be surprised if this game is still around in a year.
---
I remember back when the game released wild Appalachia, people were claiming that their characters were deleted but it turned out that most of them were lying.
---
Well, LadyDevann is busy playing The Outer Worlds on her twitch channel. I'm not kidding. Maybe LadyDevann just hates 76 so much that she personally doesn't want to play it anymore.
---
Treasure maps drop all of the power armor plans but only savage divide, mire and bog from personal experience. I'm not sure about ash heap, toxic valley, or forest
---
I would argue they aren’t good nor bad. They’re just a group of individuals who want to be left to their own devices. As such you can find both good and bad in that spectrum.
---
People are dumb for thinking anyone is telling them how to spend money. Buy whatever you want but if you do buy the sub stop saying bullshit that you aren't to blame for Betheadas scam monetisations. By buying it you're supporting it.
---
In the context of 76, yes, because the Pre-War US Government had objectively become a full-blown militarized, fascist state, promoting war, experimenting on its own citizens, etc.
---
The CIA says Sodium Pentothol makes you *really* "open minded".
---
Yes, you can, and should, and we should discuss the problems. But, we also shouldn't be attacked incessantly, because we don't share the same opinion. 
---
 Besides, it's only your *opinion*, that it's a duck.
---
I love to decorate and stuff my camp as well. That’s also how I worked the settlements in fallout 4. I just believe that this aesthetic and style fits the world more than your average “floating base” lol.
---
Check out Norespawns on YouTube, mostly on fo4 but his fo76 builds are great as well. Dude was a huge inspiration next to evilviking.
---
Great job on your camp. Wish I ran into more like it. Cheers, let’s have some nukashine
---
I would've paid for a spiral staircase and pretty much any fanciful, frivolous piece of camp garnish that caught my eye. (Theremin, anyone?) But trying to sell me junk storage on an ongoing monthly basis...? It's a joke. But I'm not laughing.
---
Because the yearly subscription cost a lot more
---
Question if you haven't played the game, how do you know Bethesda is ripping people off?
---
Cash Registers have unlimited weight.
---
I cleared up about 500 lbs of stash with ~10 of every bulkable item and 1-200 of the rest. Maybe they had unscrapped heavy items like Deathclaw Hands or etc.
---
It sounds like you're relying on semantics.
---
I've posted a similar one few hours ago. Mods keep on bringing it down for no reason.
---
It’s hilarious how every single one of these responses are saying: “and if that’s your first point I won’t even read it” and then continue to praise Bethesda and call everyone haters. Your ignorant by your own choice, your not even able to *read* anything that disagrees with you. It’s quite sad.
---
Yeah I was gonna say in usual FO fashion they're not really either, or could be interpreted as either. Gray area.
---
Aren't they just in the power plant workshops?
---
People still play this "game"?
---
Name one 🤣
---
I know a lot.
---
I honestly didn't even bother with any of it. I am going to be getting Fallout 1st regardless of what anyone else thinks. I like what they are adding with it. And no, no one's going to change my mind for me.
---
I didn't mean you. I meant p2w players going "me having the thing doesn't affect you, so don't complain, peasant" and then, presumably, "but I don't want you having the thing for free and I don't see the hypocrisy in that."
---
People that make clickbait videos for money claim someone is money greedy? That's like a pot chastising a kettle for their particular color of metal.
---
Did you intensely specify that you aren’t against 76 like I did? I’ve posted several things sort of like this but in each one I make it VERY clear where my actual stance is just because of how this week has been going
---
Except some of it like the ranger is lore friendly
---
That says much more about you literacy limits than the text quality itself.
---
I bought FO1st and you don’t speak for me.  Servers have been good. I have blue screened once since Wednesday and that’s not a server issue.
---
You're sitting here getting mad about something that hasn't happened. This is peak outrage circlejerk.
---
On top of that, you're still fucking playing fallout 76 whilst whining on reddit about how much you hate fallout 76. Make up your mind. Are you quitting the game or not?
---
And on the topic of legendaries, I've been saying since a month or two after launch that they ruined the fucking game. They should be removed altogether. All you morons do is farm farm farm for 3 star legendaries and get angry and complain when content comes out and the reward is a new unique outfit or something because "WTF BETHESDA I WANT LEGENDARIES". And all new enemies added to the game need to be bullet sponges because of you guys being obsessed with your fucking legendaries and one shotting everything.
---
If this game was dialed back and made MUCH harder. Removed legendaries, made it more hardcore like a survival game etc. It would be so much fucking better.
---
Ok that makes sense.
---
Only thing that makes them respawn is time, or a brand new player in the area. The game treats a 'server hopper' as a new player ;)
---
No, my enjoyment come from playing games I like, such as FO76. See, I'm dependent on what someone else is doing. My enjoyment is the most important thing and you all have given me a ton of that in the past few days! I don't really give a rat's ass that you think I'm "damaging the industry ". I've been gaming longer than most of have been alive and I'll continue to do so on my terms, not yours.
---
It seems like a pretty acceptable response to being attacked when you don't want to fight back too.
---
They've already put weapons in the shop. So it's not implausible.
---
Oh dear. That’s really bad. Welcome to the world of real life.
---
You can get the fixer plan and other rewards. Its just youre most likely going to get a fedora. I was being sarcastic.
---
&gt;BugthEsdA
---
/r/gaming levels of pandering. Low effort circlejerking.
---
&gt; "Please daddy Todd, fuck me harder" like damn. 
---
People still bringing up todd even though he doesn't work on 76 lmao. Why does nobody want those 2 big guys who are the leads on fallout 76 to answer for their shit? It's always todd taking the hits for these guy's fuck ups.
---
Ah shit, okay yeah thats what I  was reffering to, you are absolutely correct! I thought you were using a different currency.
---
People are annoyed about paying taxes, yet they pay them every year...hypocrites!
---
Private session and private server or whatever anyone wants to call it is mainly due to issues overall in game that happen whether game mechanics or player related. 
---
I bought the subscription due to having $54 in MS points and credit so I said sure... my friends and son don’t have a subscription and we had an amazing time! 
---
First actual plus was no one one shotting the legendary in Uranium Fever... that seems to happen a lot in different events with 0 consideration of others at same events... sorry buddy that your bloody build can do that but it’s not exactly needed at camp fire tales... but it happens a lot and more. 
---
PvP and PvE is a huge issue... add griefers... sorry but a lot of people don’t PvP nor want to PvP or have others instigate PvP with them. Some say “it’s part of the game” and they have to accept that answer... ok... well a subscription is now part of the game... accept that answer. 
---
Making money and violating rules is ok? Pretty sure it violates the TOS... but that’s a non issue with you but a company can’t make money? Not even to improve the game like ESO has? 
---
You can’t say one is ok and turn a blind eye to it and one is wrong...
---
If you come on to reddit, sure youll get the wool ober your eyes. In game nearly everyone I come across has the emotes, so you tell me?
---
There is a difference between raw hatred and hating because we care
---
I have had the same problem on my Xbox one, was trying to have fun with a player online an it kept crashing every 8 to 10 minutes. The other guy also had problems with freezing and lag
---
Well I’m glad to know it’s not just me!!  I didn’t get Fallout 1st, but I am having major server problems. In fact I just put up a post saying exactly that. I would be extra pissed off if I paid for that service and continued to have server problems. I don’t know what is going on, but it’s LAME!!!
---
So you're childish, self-centered, and myopic.
---
Literally every company is after $$$$.
---
I think I like FO 76's soundtrack better than FO 4's. Jeremy Soule is amazing as well for the Elder Scrolls, but as far as he has shared, that isn't happening for ES VI. If Inon Zur is composing for ES VI (don't know definitively who composed for the E3 teaser) or someone else, it will be a shame to not hear Jeremy Soule's music in it, but I'm interested to see the talent of whoever gets the job.
---
FYI... read about Reddit upvote and downvote system... it’s not what a lot of people think it is...
---
I would like diffetent vending machines, so you want a gas station camp, then a gas bowser vendor. A comic book vendor for a comic shop, that sort of stuff
---
Heavy combat has the best damage protection but no built-in rad resistance. Marine armor has a decent amount of damage resistance along with a pretty fair amount of rad resistance as well. Other than those two IMO the only reason to wear the other armors is because you haven't found/bought the plans to build either combat or Marine. I'm sure some people just wear the armor they think looks cool too.
---
Yes!! It’s gotten pretty bad!!! Thank you for responding.
---
Thats what I figured. Roleplay wise it would make sense a vault dweller would figure this out after learning about the other vaults, West-Tek, Huntersville, The Enclave etc.
---
Lol smoke some more drugs
---
1. Probably a lot of self selection here. The people that remain are the people who are willing to accept shitty business practices.
---
2. If you don't care about cosmetics you'll no have spent any of the atoms the game gives you for free. May as well spend them on something to take away some of the grind Bethesda built into the game.
---
3. Gotta spend the atoms they gave us foe the vinyl bags on something.
---
Coming Mama!
---
I also came from eso and expected a rocky start, and boy was it rocky lol if you on pc I can help you on your way to lvl 50 (which is max level for weapons and armor) because that grind is still kinda harsh if you dont have friends.
---
Mine have been fine thus far.
---
It sure does for me, brings a smile to my face knowing the ‘very smart’ people still giving Bethesda their money are going to get fucked over.
---
i uninstalled as well but stuck around this subreddit community to watch the car crash smolder
---
I have a question. How do you type? There's no way you can see the screen with Pete Hines' crotch in the way. Do you use mirrors?
---
So only 2000 paragraphs now?
---
I spent $12 dollars on gta on sale and have gotten more than a whale shark card‘s worth in ingame cash just from playing, not even using glitches. It’s easy.
---
Ironic that you couldn’t read the whole thing and decide to make a 3 line comment about you giving up. As you said two times
---
That's so funny hahaha
---
&gt;Bland? Compared to FO76? 
---
No? Bland. Compared to nothing. Just bland. The only reason it's actually being hyped up so much is because people are comparing it to FO76.
---
If 76 wasn't around with a bad rep to make outer worlds circlejerks stronger: I really believe it wouldn't be being called a fucking "masterpiece" because it's not.
---
Honestly as much as money has different values and all I feel like the values don't add up for other countries. $23 a month is inexcusable as much as that's apparently the worth of $13 for us Americans. I know they're trying to make it "equally" priced all around but christ it almost makes this American exclusive.
---
Am Free States, can confirm am good.
---
That's rough mate.
---
And people still question if this is pay to dominate.
---
NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME HERE!
---
Everyone has the right to tell you whatever they want to tell you. Unless it breaks the rules of this sub. And when that spending indirectly affects me, I'll tell you to sit on it. No, having a "real argument" is never pointless. Stop making excuses. You admit you enjoy watching people rage. You are every bit the troll you claim of others. No self awareness at all.
---
I play the game. Been playing since I preordered last year. I may not continue because of people like you. People like you got Marvel Heroes cancelled. Those forums were so full of smug, selfish, fanboys. And when the company banned anyone critical, those fanboys found they weren't paying enough money and the company went under.
---
They're still posting about sad they are. None of them realize they contributed. You never do.
---
Natural selection at it's finest
---
My post has a massive SATIRICAL POST in the title and it's obviously a funny take on fallout 1st situation. It's not even written in a hateful way or anything. Do I really need to write "I love fallout 76" at the end to not get it deleted? It's like North Korea in here...
---
😂 yes I was specifically annoyed with the 4,000 paragraph posts.
---
I know it. But really is posible that that problem comes back? I mean if it's true send a quick ticket to Bethesda because this is serious
---
Nice try
---
Just in case the devs miss your post here on reddit, it might be better to send issues like this through their support page. 
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
ATM, I 'd hate to be the intern at Bethesda that has to filter through the public forums for feedback.
---
I said I am not discussing selling items or anything of that nature. You also don't have to defend your purchase. I do always welcome people saying why so I can understand. Don't accept that paying a subscription is now part of the game when they made the problems to begin with. They made the problems and sell the solution, see how that is messed up? Telling us all dlc would be free then charging an out of control rate is ok?
---
In 3-6 months, I hope this sub is less toxic, but thats just a dream.
---
I wana go back to seeing posts complaining about legendary drops.
---
I don't care what they think.  Life is far too short to get bent-out-of-shape over a video game, let alone *someone else's* video game preferences.  Or, for that matter, to seek their "approval" in the games you play.
---
Who exactly am I dominating?
---
Hey, if your job relied on hiding negativity unless the OP sounds insane, you'd make posts disappear too.
---
I think it was dumb, but admittedly am a grown adult and a one time 13 dollar drop for one month to test the pvt server seemed worth it to me.
---
Here's my findings since day 1:
---
*PVT server is MUCH more stable than public, though the occasional crash will eff shit up.
---
*If the server owner crashes, the others in the World DONT lose the World or get kicked, even if they don't have F1st.  They only boot them if the owner of the server leaves the game entirely.
---
*If another player has FO1st when the initial pvt server owner leaves, its been seamless where the server stays stable and ongoing for all as the existing players in the World have FO1st.
---
*Day 1 - Legendaries were INSANE.  I got 4 3Star armors and 3 3Star weapons in the first hour.  After first patch since the drop, its been nerfed HORRIDLY, at least in my experience, with mostly shitty events popping where prior Heart of the Swamp and Uranium Fever would pop on the hour, now lucky if 1-2 times in a 4+ hour session.
---
IF you have friends whom play regularly, Id say its worth it IMO for the pvt server alone.  That noted, its shitty of Bethesda and I do feel bad for the younger crowd and those whom cant really swing the cost.
---
To be fair though, Im 100% sure Ill cancel likely within 1-2 months.  Its sure to lose its luster so no way Id buy a full year for a game I'm not sure Ill be playing in 5 months.
---
Me too!
---
4 pisses me off... I don't know how else to explain to people that this is at the very least a STEP torwards pay to win bullshit. But all of these, I'm just so fucking tired...
---
Please show me an the doll where Bethesda hurt you. Obviously you have no clue what pay-to-win is
---
Good to know
---
Nobody wants the game to be dead. We want it to be good. We all paid for it! But Bethesda lied to us multiple times. And continue to lie. Every time I think maybe they leanred, and they have the opportunity to make good with us, they do something worse than before. They continue to abuse the few people left who still believe in them. After a certain point you have to question how important a single video game is.
---
....how?
---
1, 4, 7, &amp; 9 would all be a part of my camp if they ever offered them
---
Whales always try to find ways to justify being whales.
---
The fuck are you talking about?
---
Unfortunately the idea of 76 is seen as "closed permanently after leaving" due to the auto lifesupport deactivation, I actually had an idea for it to be an endgame raid that'd open up after every other vault opened but honestly I know they won't do it.
---
if only we could take that kind of class warfare into the real world :(
---
 &gt; I buy regularly atoms
---
Well that's just a whole other mistake you're making.
---
Thanks mister!
---
They should just start an r/antifo76 and have big Q.Q circle jerk.
---
Heists make you so much money there's barely a need for Shark cards. A single friend and I duoed them and in a day I had the underground facility superbase.
---
Just read that you need to beat the raid on standard difficulty something like 45 times in order to have the materials to craft the set.
---
The amount of ammo, fusion cores, stimpacks, etc., for 45 raids would be enormous and a significant grind in itself.
---
Really wanted a set... but looks like I'll be sticking with my X-01 and Ultracite armours.
---
A ton bought it this week, but half a ton will not renew at the months end. Its hard to justify $22 a month on some additional storage and a tent.
---
well i dont care about playing a world simualator about rebuilding the world where everybody has unlimited ressources, what even is the point
---
You on xbox? If so I can craft you one if you can supply materials.
---
Yeah you get a friend and run Heists and you'll be swimming in cash. I got that cool underground super facility in a day just duoing them with a buddy.
---
If it's any consolation, I bet tomorrow will be rife with "WTF I have no idea what's going on with Mischief Night" posts. 😂
---
You're right, really right, I'd hate too, and I'm opening a ticket too with some captures. But I want be listened because after 2000 hours of game, 2 accounts, 8 chars (just 1 char mule), the money, lot of love for this game I want a game that work as it have to work.
---
Mods this is clearly a shit post to downplay the awesome subscription. He clearly never bought it. Do your job and delete this post like you delete other negative posts! /S
---
Ps: but seriously mods delete negative posts...fcking censorship in this subredid.
---
Yeah. Mind you that's not always the internet I'm on (it's actually my mom's internet) l, but it still sucks when I have to use it.
---
yeah but how are people going to farm a few hundred karma if they're not complaining about the update this month that they don't like?
---
It’s crazy to think Horse Armor was the worst DLC practice back then. What was it, $5? That’s not even a single outfit in 76! I get games need to make money, but there’s a line and these guys crossed it. I It would be one thing if 76 was a free beta with micro transactions akin to fortnite, but they valued it at full retail price, more for the America paints included and sold it as a complete game!!
---
Except that it also gets a decent amount of attention.  YongYea has a lot of viewers, and a lot of people have seen this clip already.  And if Bethesda and their shareholders know that enough people hate what they're doing, in an effort to make people want to buy their future products, they're incentivized to change things.  We don't know everything about EA's new Jedi game, but look at how much morally better that looks compared to anything they've put out in the past two years.
---
But then again, look at NBA2K's model after all of the FIFA criticism.  Either way, this guy protesting in game added one more to their number, but it also was a method of using irony to gain more attention to a bad situation.
---
I’ve never had a problem with it before until about the time fallout 1st was announced
---
Its "worth it" according to a metric explicitly created *by Bethesda*. That doesn't mean its *actually* worth it. Think about what else you can get elsewhere for the same amount of money, then come back to me with how it is "worth it".
---
Or “FO1st members don’t have to deal with x or y from the event”.  I’m a glutton for punishment as I still read this sub, I should really stop until the QQ posts stop.
---
Theres a balance between both your statements. That's where I sit.
---
People do have an absurd entitlement complex.
---
As far as I'm concerned everything in the atom shop is free. I have more things than I can name from the shop and it's all been free. "*But I want it and haven't earned the atoms!!*" erm ok. Sounds like they'll need to save up. Same as saving caps for serums recipes. It's not a weird idea to me. Will take you a couple of weeks saving all your daily caps limit to get a serum recipe. You could get 800-1000 atoms in that time from just dailies and weeklies.
---
The fuss over the atom store is bullshit. Fallout 4 has creation club, which was a similar idea. But you couldn't earn points like you now can. This is objectively better.
---
However. Pete Hines said that all future content from release would be free. We were told that.
---
That unlimited scrap box is not free. I cannot earn it through playing the game like I can the scrap bot. It *is* paid content. We were lied to and that's not ok.
---
Other games charge a subscription. Totally true and I think it's an important fact. If we want this game to continue **and to have new content added**; they need to justify it. I've had to explain why I'm putting extra time and resources into projects and I guarantee that's happened with this game. Charts of revenue with developer cost next to it in another colour. Somebody saying "Hold on, you've got devs working on this right now?" That's not gReEdY BeThEdDa. Theres a reason they report upwards.
---
Buuuuuuut... we were told it was all free. That's unavoidable.
---
Yes this sub is frankly mental. Half the posts are "wouldn't this feature be nice?" And the other half are "Nobody asked for this feature! FiX yOuR GaMe". But this time, for once, the uproar is right.
---
Edit: btw I played the shit out of GTAO. That's still getting new content drip fed because people buy shark cards. That pays for all GTAO players to have new features. That's how business works. They can justify it. That's ok with me. Even though it was absolutely pay to win.
---
But those guys never had features I couldn't grind out and earn the money for. Even with it being pay to win. This now does.
---
For the currency to fluctuate for that $2 to actually make a difference, the exchange rate would have to 1AUD = 0.83 USD. That's laughably unheard of nowadays.
---
Until the currency comes even remotely close to 0.83 USD, it's just a greed tax.
---
Lol same here! I thoroughly enjoy not feeling weird about wasting time on a game made by a company that only enjoys raping my tight ass.
---
&gt; It’s literally worth it if you wanted the atoms and nothing else.
---
That would be true if the atoms were worth it to begin with. It’s a completely arbitrary virtual currency with no actual value, and no practical value beyond what you can buy with it. Unless what you can buy with it is worth the actual dollar value of the atoms used, it’s not worth it. $15 for 1100 atoms isn’t even close to “worth it” for me when something like a blue power armor skin is 1800 atoms, and $9-12 for 1650 isn’t either. That’s still $10+ for a power armor skin. 
---
It may be worth it to someone else, but the atom shop in general isn’t “worth it” to me. They’d have to cut the price of atoms or items by a factor of at least 10 to even approach being worth it for me - I’d maybe see $1.50 as worth it for a power armor skin/color, maybe.
---
Edit: I’m not saying that you should let people tell you how to spend your money or how to feel, I’m just saying that the argument against it being “worth it” does have merit. Getting something for $10 isn’t necessarily worth it just because you *could* spend $20 on it if it’s not worth $10 to you in the first place. Even in the context of video game DLC exclusively, I could get say, a whole Mortal Kombat 11 character for $6. I’ll get a lot more enjoyment out of that than a power armor skin, or a few repair kits, or whatever else the atom shop offers.
---
Its okay to not pay millions of dollars in taxes...
---
Which could in theory help the US Goverment with its issues currently.
---
Okay. I'm not even sure what kinda wacky tobacco you are on, but you should share it with the class.
---
Define griefing as against TOS please, there’s a bit of disconnect as to what griefing means so I want to be clear on what you mean by griefing.
---
Cause there’s the true griefing of verbal harassment and following players all across the map, and then there’s taking a shot at another player. I’ve been called a griefer for accidentally one shoting a mob ingame so I want to clarify what sort of griefing you mean is against TOS
---
He wasnt collecting anything while stuck (I noticed cause the bin was near empty long after it should of had stuff in it). Picking up the station and placing it down again fixed it. He also wasnt talking while stuck, something he usually wont stop doing.
---
Weird considering a huge chunk of people just quit/moved to different amazon servers. You would think theres less server strain on public now
---
But that’s exactly it. Worth is subjective. So I can argue it’s worth it (which I don’t based on principle) but I could never convince you.
---
Here we go again......
---
That would be cool and all, but they'd need to explain how we can breathe in there, because the life support systems shut down after everyone got out, if I recall correctly.
---
I crash everyday. Crash 76.
---
Fallout 76 and then the shit rockstar put out just made me say no no no to all this bullshit.  What fucking hot garbage.  I've limited my time to simulators at least I get my money's worth.
---
Bethesda has been giving out those reasons since  New Vegas made them look bad,and they screwed Obsidian out of a bonus over a single digit metacritic score difference.
---
It really isn't that hard to quit playing. I quit a long time ago, and have just been waiting for it to get better. I'm still waiting.
---
I may be wrong but, I’ve heard reports of the tents being super laggy. And I’ve seen quite a few people with FO1st. I think that’s what it is
---
Thanks for that, dude. I have to deal with my wife now. She woke up from my laughter.
---
Gtaonline is blatantly pay to win and people love it. explain that.
---
Gaming should have told xbox live to FO when it first came out and everyone should have shown Bethesda that horse armour isn't going to be bought for ridiculous sums of money.  Now companies charge for nothing and create demand (Why have a colour slider when you can sell grey variant 452 for ten bucks and 453 for another ten)
---
I’ve had the same thing with popular plan drop locations
---
I did. Months and months ago. When it was clear this game was just a cheap, nasty cash grab. 
---
I just stay subbed for the schadenfruede.
---
Nah, you still delete negative posts. 3 of my post got removed for no apparent reason. Reply from mod: we don't allow meme and shit posts. What a fucking joke. My post was a well written satirical post and it's states in the title. Censorship at it's finest.
---
Yeah, but you experience a brief relief if you take the thing you’re addicted too.
---
Bethesda never ceases to amaze me with how bad they can fuck up this game
---
Hey look, someone who hasn't played the game! Tell me all about it. I've currently got quests to travel back and forth from to several different planets, ships and whatnot. It's basically a classic Black Isle RPG with New Vegas gameplay elements. But you keep right on pretending that it's average.
---
The pizza thing works for what I needed to say... that if people are good consumers and 4 of us get screwed out of mushrooms (stability) because some assholes want more emotes, the ones not getting stability should be ticked off. Yeah, listening to the market and consumers, reading reviews is being a good consumer. You want to just rush in pay for shit and then complain ? You are suppose to do research and then purchase. When did this get so fucked? Like it or not the raid is unplayable and wont be getting addresses when all the people trying to play it are paying now. It's like you read my point and intentionally dance around a point I'm not making. Ugh. People make me sick with rage anymore. Gamers have no right to complain about shit when they do this to themselves. Gaming industry is booming and players are too frivolous in their spending to hold them accountable. Let them eat cake.
---
Same reason people like cocaine despite ot being illegal.
---
Also, GTAO has fucking content, and is FREE with the offline game.
---
Says you I've been here since beta and after this update I have to force myself to even check out the main menu of this game. I have such a bad taste in my mouth for this game now because of this update. And I have 3 lev 100's and 1 lev 300, I still don't want to give up on the game fully but after this I might as well just move on to a game that's complete.
---
Er, you mean *Tuesday.* It doesn't start until Tuesday
---
If Bethesda cared about their reputation they'd try to do something positive about that "the game is broken" public perception. Instead of making decisions like Fallout 1st, make decisions like Wastelanders. Make decisions like "Release ACTUAL private servers you host yourself with mods". Make people know the game is being fixed and improved. No more scams. I'm afraid to buy FO5 Starfield and ES6, and I've been a fan since Morrowind. I'm watching as my favorite game company is becoming worse than EA.
---
I made a topic about this the night the patch dropped.
---

Someone posted that the code is all 0's. It opens up the wall to reveal an elevator, but you can't use it yet. It literally changed when the patch on the 23rd dropped.
---
&gt; There is absolutely nothing wrong with hoping the best for a group of people who make cool games and [open their doors to terminally ill children](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-07-23-todd-howard-reveals-by-far-the-greatest-thing-bethesda-game-studios-does) with no fan fare.

Fallacy of relative privation i.e. trying to compare the best case scenario against this situation to try and make it appear better than it actually is. Except that it does nothing to change how bad the subscription service is. Much the same way that a serial rapist isn't suddenly ok because they also happened to be an environmental conservationist.
---
I don't doubt that there are good people at Bethesda and they've done some decent things in the past for their fans. Doesn't change how bad this subscription situation is in the slightest.
---
I have a few that won't compete(restarting a power plant, finding bog town and maybe more), bethesda customer service won't help either
---
It's pretty much a classic Black Isle/Interplay game with modern mechanics. Reviews are overwhelmingly positive. I agree, it's got a few minor flaws but it makes Bethesda games look like trash.
---
They should really fix survival
---
&gt;I play the game. Been playing since I preordered last year. I may not continue because of people like you. 
---
People like me? Random old farts typing inane comments on the internet? If you chose to leave, so be it, that'll be your choice. I'll actually be a bit sad for that because as misguided as you are at least you have some passion.  
---
Time for my nap little one, perhaps we'll chat again. 👍😆
---
You haven't played it.
---
Would be great
---
Just got the game couple days ago , hasn't crashed and servers been fine .
---
Done! r/AntiFO76
---
Thanks! I'm glad some folks here still have sense of humor. Cheers!
---
Honestly just take a power plant workshop, before private servers I would and rarely got pvp. And of course on private sever you won’t get pvp and you can take all three. Are you on Xbox? You can use my private server to stock up if you want- I always claim all three power plants and leave them open as there is no risk for pvp.
---
Why so serious?
---
Im getting the same error crash on you. Probably the buggest game on PS4. I thought it was due to my PS4 but nope. I got a second brand new PS4 pro recently but im still facing these crashes... f76 is turning into crash 76
---
And when you log out of your own server you paid for, workshops and everything else resets. It sounds more like a crappy rental fee.
---
Yes and no. They aren't intentionally evil but they can also be kind of ass holes.
---
So true. Inventory management seems like half of the game. I'm level 260 and trying to keep enough scrap and flux to sustain late game characters is too much. Can't pick anything up but I need it. Its not fun. It's stress. This will not keep players engaged for a long time
---
I fully agree but I'm upset about that sweet, sweet Ranger Riot Armor..
---
I hope it stays that way for your sake
---
Fallout first players are providing revenue that will bring in more content and upgrades for everyone who plays fallout 76
---
The internet is full of information, and knowing people with the game provides even more :)
---
It's also hypocritical to scream about not supporting bethesda whilst buying from the fucking **epic games store**. So I won't be supporting that either.
---
Which tells me that they're not spinning up an image of a fresh server each time. 
---
Or they're loading an image randomly taken from an unused public server. 
---
Or they're finding a public server that's momentarily empty. Flagging it as private. And loading you into it.
---
Could make a quest about getting it back up and running. make the vault great again!
---
Sadly I’m on ps4, but I got to play a little this morning and it didn’t seem bad I’m excited to play, but thanks for the offer man
---
&gt;and that allows you to “steal” loot from players on adventure servers. 
---
How are you stealing from players on Public Servers ?
---
Nope i’m on PS4 but thanks for the offer
---
I'm relatively positive the five different threads about "uninstalling and never coming back, and you shouldn't either" that have been posted in the last week want the game to be dead.
---
I'm also relatively positive the people who have been saying 76 should never have been made since before launch, and are still here attacking Bethesda over a bag want the game to be dead, too.
---
If you really want the game to get better, quitting the game isn't how you do it. A handful of reddit users quitting is a drop in the bucket. Reddit does not represent any games community no matter how self important some people may think they are.
---
The insane hyperbole that some people get up to on this sub isn't going to help anything. The game has real problems but they get buried under the most ridiculous complaints.
---
Leather: Highest energy resistance of all armor types, low Ballistic resistance
---
Metal: Highest ballistic resistance of all armor types, low energy resistance
---
Raider and Trapper: Similar to Metal. High ballistic resistance, low energy resistance 
---
Marine: Light armor, but it only comes in standard form unlike every other type which can get Sturdy and Heavy variants and it's the weakest armor in the game, having *very* pitiful energy and ballistic resistance (so much for supposedly being armor that can rival Power Armor...)
---
Wood: The Lightest armor in the game, but also the second-weakest
---
Robot and Combat: Equal amounts of high energy and ballistic resistance, but also weigh alot
---
Display cases were a popular request that would let people place items on display in their camps. They were supposed to come in Wild Appalachia last spring but were delayed until the Nuclear Winter update in summer, then released with a budget requirement that made them all but useless for most players. It wasn't unreasonable that they would have some cost, but I think most people expected them to either make the cost really low or increase camp budget with the release.
---
Legendary progression was supposed to arrive in Nuclear Winter over the summer and was delayed, then delayed again until next year. I think the expectation now is Q1 2020 but it's hard to say what will happen because Wastelanders was also delayed until Q1. 
---
Two vault raids were supposed to arrive in Nuclear Winter, but only one showed up and it wasn't received particularly well. Apparently the killing was good but there were some performance problems, people who DCd couldn't get back into the vault, and the overall design itself wasn't seen as particularly interesting (there are three different designs which require varying degrees of tedious quest object looting and accessing terminals that could experience delays). The second vault never appeared and to my knowledge hasn't even been mentioned by Bethesda. 
---
In addition to this stuff, Nuclear Winter Mode (the Battle Royale mode that set the tone for the summer phase) was pretty warmly received at the start of the update, but since then has had only moderate support alongside frequent accusations of cheating and the overpowered nature of the kangaroo mutation. So that one has been a mixed bag. My sense is that it doesn't have a lot of community involvement but I could be wrong.
---
Honestly, they did well for a good 3 months post-release, wow'd a lot of people with the roadmap, and then did an ok job with the first part (Wild Appalachia in spring). But they started to teeter and it's been at best up and down since then, with little overall progress through summer and fall.
---
Bethesda needs to pick a direction and commit to it because they're trying to juggle too much and not doing really well with any of it. A lot is riding on Wastelanders' release state and how much it really offers, as well as giving the community its requests without a price tag for the next while.
---
Awh it got removed! I really wanted to see what it had to say. Damn Sensitive mods...
---
Looking at the Wikia page it seems they are, although Addictol is not the only object that can cure them. Radscorpion egg omelette also does it.
---
So how do junkies builds stay addicted? Do they have to keep taking all those chems?
---
How so?
---
Ok, good story.
---
So?
---
Someone else said 15 minutes but that seems much too short right?
---
No idea why are you so defensive lol. F76 crashing is like a norm now.
---
For my case, I got two PS4 and both get the occasional crash. The second one is a brand new PS4 pro obtained last week.
---
When crashes happen to a number of users then its likely that f76 code have issues. Its not surprising considering the number of bugs in the game.
---
Or the op tent. Or that they introduced p2w after promising not to.
---
Did they sell you those old assets at a premium?
---
It's not bland. You haven't played it. You're spiteful and childish.
---
It's also over 30-40 hours long.
---
You have 100+ hours of antiquated gameplay, ugly graphics/armor/weapons, bad animations, and unbalanced combat. And that's IF the game is actually functioning properly. I'll tell you what TOW doesn't have? Miles of bugs that date back to previous games from the developer. They spent 2 years fixing bugs and fine tuning so the game runs better. It only takes you 100 hours to play Fallout 76 because there is so much downtime to replenish ammo/healing. the main story can be done in an afternoon.
---
But you got a lot of it!
---
Metal- very high dr but low er
---
Leather- very high er but low dr
---
Combat- high in both but slightly higher er than dr
---
Scout- again high in both but higher dr than er
---
Marine- decent in both but also has rad resist if you want that
---
Trapper- not great er and dr but fantastic rad resist
---
Depending on what you’re looking for is what you want. For me I wanted high dr but also good er so I’ve gone for combat chest, and scout arms. (For some reason scout limbs give more dr than combat limbs, but combat chest is better than scout chest)
---
Hopefully this helps, to sum it up the best all round armor with both high dr and er is heavy combat or scout depending on if you prefer higher dr (scout) or higher er (Combat). If you don’t care about er than all metal is very high dr!
---
It's got a lot worse. In fact much worse than I can recall at any other point.
---
It's not just you so.
---
Pokemon sword and shield boycott! We know Zeni is sucking life out of the Fallout title.
---
I mean sure. 
---
Thought the term "white knight" is used for those who are aggressive DEFENDING the game and/or the subscription service. Not those criticizing it.
---
But yeah. The point has been made.
---
Most reputable vendors sell them for about 1 cap per percent charge (100% charged = 100 caps, 25% charge left = 25 caps). 
---
I see fully-charged being sold for 125-150 caps, also, but you can find the lower prices with a little shopping around.
---
I think its rather telling that the game where bethesda wants to do some mandatory online stuff, people are excited about not interacting with the online stuff.
---
cool, you don't matter OP so peace out keyboard warrior
---
I do recommend giving capping the framerate to 60 or 120 a try. I used to crash at ultra, but since capping to 120 I've been able to stay at max settings without issue. Worth a shot, anyway.
---
I think responders are the only “good guys”
---
Would you settle for us parading around in Liberty Prime PA while constantly giving the Mothman emote?
---
Made it about 7 hours in. 
---
I love it. The world is alive. The lore/world is evocative of the first Bioshock in that there’s a real sense of wonder you have about what’s going on behind the dystopian sci-fi bones. 
---
The writing is New Vegas again—but more adult, more serious, more polish. Much less camp. 
---
The voice acting is compelling. One of the first mods I downloaded when I played Fallout 4 was the one that muted the main character. Here, I actually *want* to listen to the characters speak their lines. The leader of the first town’s voice is amazing, specifically. 
---
The story so far is good. The game is “easy,“ but the gunplay and weapons are satisfying. But reducing the game to its combat system is looking at the visible portion of a glacier. Combat is easy, but choices, about developing your character, about dialogue, are hard. It’s a real RPG. I sometimes really worry about the future repercussions of what lies I choose to tell and how much I reveal about myself. 
---
It’s a great game and I recommend it highly.
---
...says the person with a free states flair
---
You seem to think I'm comparing 76 to outer worlds lmao.
---
I don't even play 76.
---
Outer worlds on its own...not compared to a failing game, is bland and boring and short.
---
The fact that you have to compare the game to fucking fallout 76 shows how terrible it must be on its own. You need to compare it to a dying, failure of a game to make it look good.
---
It sucks to say because although I had my issues with this game I kept playing but now.........I don’t even wanna log in anymore. There’s no new things to do, the atomic shop is everywhere it’s just sadding
---
They were actively working with the responders and BoS to fight the plague.  Sounds pretty good to me.
---
What exactly should be paid for in your opinion if not these cosmetic things?
---
You are rationalizing. So many people played for hundreds of hours and are stopping because they don't like the direction. I'm one of them. 
---
You don't have to dislike it just because we do, but now you're just pretending like nothing is wrong.
---
 &gt; I'm relatively positive the five different threads about "uninstalling and never coming back, and you shouldn't either" that have been posted in the last week want the game to be dead.
---
Not if you're thoughtful and understand why those threads exist.
---
y'all some dum dums $100/yr for a private server is goddamn steal. Putting the QoL stuff behind the paywall is the real problem.
---
Yes? You have brotherhood lol.
---
Censorship is strong in this Reddit...
---
People hate it which is why everyone and their mother literally did The Bogdan Problem over and over again to get millions of dollars to actually afford anything, and the only people still playing are the RP'ers and Whales, everyone else eventually jumps ship to an online experience that doesn't end in an Oppressor Mk2 glitch speeding up to you shooting rockets and glitch speeding away so fast rockets can't hit them.
---
That or they utilize other vehicles with cheap tactics like a helicopter you can't target with rockets or a Delorean car that climbs faster than the Oppressor, or they quick buy all the bunker research to get explosive bullets and other ammo types to have an edge over everyone else unlocking that stuff normally through gameplay.
---
People love it, just lol...
---
Him paying for  first doesn't damage the game in anyway, it's his choice just like it's yours not to pay for it, video games have been about monetization forever not just fallout, and if someone playing the game the way they want damages the game for you, that is your problem not his not the games.
---
You on now?
---
No it is all fine, hell it is great to undercut me. It encourages me to study, to learn, to expand my knowledge.
---
I have less of an issue with subscriptions (fuck me if I'm not still paying for a wow sub that I haven't used much in a couple years), but more that a game I bought that *didn't have* a subscription decides to add one.
---
Yeah I can't put the game down. Time passes too fast when I play Outer Worlds. I kept nodding off at church today, more than usual lol. Got home and crashed for 6 hours, and now I'm playing more. It's everything I liked about Fallout mixed with Kotor and Mass Effect.
---
The actual fixer isn’t from the event. The plans are. The fixer is from the lying Lowe questline.
---
This is sorta true only if we take as given actual price for atoms and assume it's normal.
---
same reason people used to go in the streets and throw rotten fruit at criminals; because its fun :)
---
fps drops, proper freezes and sometimes disconnects 
---
i hate the freeze whenever i press left arrow key to swap weapons
---
You have never had someone one-shot enemies at a location you were at? Did you get any loot?
---
Or Fallout in general lol
---
they took the pvp so i guess they canceled the pay to win. even tho adventure mode was much more fun
---
Why brake the rules
---
I agree, if this game is going to be a fire pit for people to throw money in I will not participate just on the principle of it. I never missed how things were back in the day more then I do now. You know what's funny just thinking about it, since the game's release as soon as I saw the Atom shop I already knew this was going to be a ride. I think I'll just throw out my lev 300 character and multiple lev 100s and just go back and play f3 fnv and forget about it.
---
It's not really hypocritical at all. You can't possibly equate anything Epic has done to combat Valve, with what Bethesda has done to US. Valve can easily fix the issue, but they don't care enough. If you take issue with Epic, then you also need to take issue with Valve. Because they do the same shit. Bethesda has gone above and beyond the usual corporate BS we have to put up with and you know it.
---
The real hypocrisy is yours. Taking umbrage with Epic, while paying Bethesda more money for garbage. Epic makes Bethesda look like saints.
---
That must be a tough worldview to live with...
---
But still, the easy solution is to stop buying games from them. The movie theater analogy only works if there is one theater in town. But there are literally thousands of theaters in this video game town. But as you said about restaurants, if the waiters are rude, you don’t come back. Sometimes restaurants that used to be good turn bad, that’s when you stop going to those places. 
---
Gamers have a bad habit of raging on reddit, then buying the next release and raging about that. Then they direct their anger at other gamers who enjoy the game. Not saying this is you necessarily, but this thread is full of it.
---
If the movie theater lies to you and treats you like shit, then pick another theater. If you keep going back, it is your fault at a certain point, not the people who enjoy the snacks.
---
I've been playing outerworlds and it made me realize how good Bethesda games are. The game world is static and shallow as fuck. It's not a bad game, but it's no where close to being on the same level as an elder scrolls or fallout game. I'm glad I did the game pass because I'm definitely not paying $60 for that game. Also you come off as a commercial spot for the OMG THE GAME MADE BY THE NEW VEGAS GUYS, so I hope obsidian is cutting you a paycheck.
---
They were also against the corruption of the government which also sounds good
---
I only ran into 1 bug in outer worlds, and that says a lot. It's mostly a well polished game.
---
Bug = I modified a heavy weapon and got stuck in the menu until I waste another mod to get out of it. It only happened a couple times though. But come to think of it I had that same problem in Fallout 4.
---
False equivalency. Comparing Fallout 1st to a serial rapist is disingenuous. A what point was the subscription service forced upon you? You didn't get a bill from Bethesda for a service you didn't sign up for. 
---
And yes, there are good people at Bethesda. They've done great things with games and with charity. Equating their work in the same sentence as a rapist is inappropriate.
---
I’ve had far more blue screen crashes. Maybe three this week. Been getting random freezes today where I’ve had to close the application but no server disconnects.
---
Yeah cause brotherhood is cool lol. Why is free states not good though?
---
Thoughtful is exactly what those people aren't. There is a middle ground between blind praise and setting things on fire. What they're doing is a temper tantrum, and the only people that works for are children with helicopter parents.
---
&gt;These people promised all free DLC
---
I have a theory about this.  At launch, this game felt unfinished. Maybe that is because it was unfinished.  What if the stuff that they call "DLC" is really just game's completion one year later?
---
Maybe human NPC's were intended to be part of the base game, but they couldn't get it done in time for Christmas 2018 so they just released a half- finished game.
---
but for real 😂
---
Just nut up and take a power plant. Things may have changed since I was low level, but I've had people multiple times help repair the plant and just they just peace out. You might even get lucky and find an already functioning plant (the steam stacks are billowing out steam in those situations.) Just play it smart, powerplant is the best way to go. Also mind the weight of cores, they can take up alot of space even in a stash.
---
You just made me say WHAT loud as fuck in a crowded bar.
---
You seriously need to make changes and help better  yourself dude, this isnt healthy.
---
I uninstalled a few months ago but I tell ya what, FO76 was much more enjoyable than fucking COD:MW 
---
WHY DO I NEVER LEARN THAT FRANCHISE IS FUCKING GARBAGE. 
---
PSA - DO NOT BUY COD:MW IT IS FUCKING GARBAGE
---
It's not pay to win, you can't pay money to get better gear or the ability to kill other players easier, having unlimited stash doesn't make it pay to win, junk is easy to come by and everybody has access to it.
---
They're further on the side of "good" than some of the factions, but still solidly in the "grey" area. They were anti-government secessionists first, so were at odds with a lot of other factions. 
---
I just like their "leave us alone, we leave you alone" ideas.
---
Not a single rule was broken in my post. Can you read with understanding?
---
The $60 video game you purchased and DLC that properly expands the game. A game shouldn't be full of microtransactions that you have to pay extra for, all these things listed are very simple cosmetic things that would be nice to have and so should be included in the game. Why would you want to have to pay to have a spiral staircase? It's just another version of stairs that, if added to the game, should just be available for free.
---
Because perk cards are a weird half baked concept.
---
Just because you don’t like Fallout 1st doesn’t mean you have to stop playing the game if you still find joy in it. I can certainly still have fun but also know I shouldn’t bother with the subscription. They already got your money so you may as well enjoy if you can!
---
No, random old farts telling companies that being pricks that lie to me, is ok by rewarding them with money for exploitative monetization. Misguided? I'm sure you have mountains of wisdom ready to back that claim but that nap is honestly a better use of your time.
---
"Little one". I wish.
---
The worst part is Bethesda lying to us. I just can’t support a company that lies to its own customers and treats them like idiots.
---
There comes a point where you cannot morally allow yourself to reap the benefits of a crime, even if you didn't commit it; When even being in its vicinity disgusts you. That's where the sudden lack of enjoyment comes from: People see what Bethesda is doing and cannot, in good conscience, continue to partake.
---
Additional points to add about workshops.
---
Their defend events allow for you to power level and farm legendaries while amassing endless junk to quickly craft and scrap guns and armor for all of their learnable mods and amass ammo.
---
A friend and I yesterday basically AFK'd keeping his private server up while we periodically jumped in, did defend/retake events and power leveled his new character while I stocked up on ammo and legendaries.
---
It is p2w, he swore it wasn't, we even had a yelling fight about it before he ultimately realized it IS p2w.  Still he's probably gonna keep on buying membership...
---
As for me, I'm playing a creative singleplayer mode on 7 Days to Die playing it like it's minecraft with zombies, I only play Fo76 when he's online now, if not for him, I'd uninstall this game.
---
fallout 1st will provide much needed funds for the dev team so they can make the game better.
---
Not sure why people are dissing fallout first subscribers. It makes more sense to praise them, because their money is fueling the free content we're getting.  I've already got my monies worth from the game so really there is no reason to complain at all.  worst case I just stop playing, which is what happens with every other game when i get tired of it. But I don't see that happening with fo76. I might take breaks but I'm keeping an eye on new content as a comes out. I wonder what the new vault raid will be like.
---
I think you're missing the point. Their are bigger more important things to worry about and put this amount of energy into then these weird fruitless neckbeard revolutions you lifeless "gamers" love fighting. If you're like in middle school or younger I get it, you probably have nothing better to do, if you're older then that it's a little sad all this energy and hate you are putting towards a video game.
---
I like some of their ideas too. I’m thinking of making my next characters begin to support them more and more as they travel the wasteland.
---
Well that's what we love, clear, authoritative and **wrong** statements.  That's a good way to win an argument.
---
No, repair kits weigh 0.5 lbs.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Repair_kit_(Fallout_76)
---
The fun part:
---
&gt; repair kits cannot be dropped, sold, or given to other player characters. 
---
This is why people who do a lot of SBQ runs don't necessarily like repair kits.
---
Do you play, "Mate"?
---
 &gt; I don't even play 76.
---
Oh, well then you're even less informed than I originally thought! You haven't played either game! Bravo.
---
I'm comparing it to 76, right now, because this is the board I'm on. It's also better than Fallout 3 and 4. And many other games. But we're on the 76 board, so yeah...it's also the current game by Bethesda...so yeah. It's not complicated.
---
i feel like u didnt read anything i said on the post.
---
But Fallout 76 has destroyed my LIFE! It's the worst most broken game ever to be developed! It's broken apart mariages, caused families to split up, runed countless consoles from them being thrown from windows. And every single time they've added ANYTHING to the game, it's the worst thing to ever happen to videogames in the history of the media! 
---
The Fridge! The Fridge is WAAAAAY too OP! How dare they put something in the game that cuts spoilage down by 50%!
---
I've been playing since the devs thought up the idea of 76, and when I started, the game didn't even download to my computer! I literally couldn't play the game! 
---
And what's with the entirely broken PvP system! Noobs are out there in the game right now, and I can't even greif them! It's so unfair!
---
Fuck off, asshat
---
It might be pretty cool if they replaced certain areas with the release of new dlc
---
Be careful, all those weepy tears can short out your keyboard.
---
Playing a game as intended is now "griefing" lol ok. Next time an enemy kills me in Call of Duty, I'll report them for griefing!
---
&gt; It’s literally worth it if you wanted the atoms and nothing else
---
You said this. These are your words. Gaze upon them, and know you cannot backtrack. You spoke this sentence as an absolute, and my duty was to refute this absolute.
---
