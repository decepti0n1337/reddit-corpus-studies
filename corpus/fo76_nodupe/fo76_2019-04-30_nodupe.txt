I'm a one handed bloodied melee with 5 pieces unyielding armor &amp; bloodied DC w/ ss,+1str. I use a few different cards for max dmg. I can get my DC up to over 10k if I get all the planets to align. Not a easy task but duable during a queen fight. I'll share ya a link. 1sec

Yeah I beat the quests in there, is there an alien in there?

Idk but it happens a lot, I just assumed it was server latency not registering the hit.

Classic Bethany.

I got 48 levels on my 5th character

Tbf we don't know if it's really a .50 BMG anyway, the weight in the in-game ammo box model is stated as being 290 gr which is definitely too light for a .50 BMG (For reference, that's around the weight of many .338 Lapua loads). And no, they actually got realistic weights for 5.56 (55 gr) and .308 (178 gr) which is what makes me think that the .50 in the Fallout universe is more along the lines of a bigger .338 than our .50 BMG.

Xbox here :)
---
I have one on my syringer. But the pearly peepers binoculars can target stuff as well.
---
Xbox OneX ( xX Vampurio Xx ) I would get skins. Please and thank you. Really need them.
---
I heard of the Bethesda account, was hoping it would load on to either platform
---
Unless there is generally something wrong with the item or how they advertised, then they won't care too much whether you actually wanted it or not.
---
I got a refund and kept the item when I put in a ticket about false advertising and misleading information about the holidays emote bundle that costed ALOT and didn't actually provide new animations.
---
If you're going to try, you need to do send the ticket through a subcategory like "download trouble" for it to actually get looked at by a real person, otherwise it will just go to the try trash.
---
Sucks. Honestly it‚Äôs apart of the game they really aren‚Äôt doing anything wrong by destroying your base
---
Is it normal for me to shoot a legendary creature then they regenerate health instantly ? Happens every time I fight one
---
K, thanks for the advice, when I submit my ticket I will try that strategy.
---
The only place where they‚Äôve come in handy for me is in the Mire at night, even then it‚Äôs just for looting
---
Can definitely still build there. I was server hopping to level an alt during double exp last night and found at least 2.
---
that is true however, i did see him near Morgatown on an over-encumbered hike, while still being submerged in the forest depths, he dropped down and frightened the hell out of me, is was like lvl 30 at the time
---
No problem, good luck!
---
*Uranium fever
---
Shouldn‚Äôt be instant, but every legendary enemy regenerates once from around 50% hp.
---
All of the rifleman perks can the ones that don‚Äôt require a scope will function on it. All of the sneak peeks apply as the weapon is completely silent. And the suppressor, tenderizer, tormentor work well on it. And bloody mess does as well.
---
There is nothing of interest I have found in Uranium Fever... so tell me more about this Radium Fever you speak of
---
You gotta pay the troll toll to find out.
---
I swore a few weeks after release I saw a few teams that were using them. Not sure if they found plans through glitching or what but I haven‚Äôt seen it since. I play on XB1
---
Maybe just add a little bit about how there should be (like most games) a confirm purchase screen before buying and you must of accidentally bought it without even realising, because of this issue
---
I can craft them but I don't remember when or how I got the plan
---
Should be +10% damage per currently active addiction, capped at 50%. I can't rule out addiction-counting bugs.
---
It's not worthless if you install an emergency flare ;)
---
How do you suppress the negative effects?!
---
Oh yeah, that actually makes perfect sense, definitely will add on.
---
Hopped dozens of times in multiple places, and finally found him on my first hop at Colonel Kelly. Might be coincidence, but maybe that's a better spawn. That was incredibly annoying.
---
I‚Äôve got 13 of them.
---
Sheepsquatch vs Mirelurk Queen would be an interesting fight.
---
Then we can put some insignia whatever there like Batman but in our case it's the Mysterious Stranger
---
I‚Äôve ran across 3 wild sheepsquatch, most near the cranberry bog.
---
Yeah. Thanks. Brain freeze.
---
I'd use it more if I could bind one to a single button on console.
---
Long day at work.

Just a btain dead old man hunched over an electronic device...
---
Think you should not get so mad it happens it's an online game I've had my base completely picked apart down to my last poster. Leave that server and start the hunt for supplies think of it as something to do. If your getting that upset maybe it's best if you do stay away not to be a sick but your clearly not enjoying the game so why play
---
Hey OP I agree 100% I feel like this definetly is an advantage. Idk if anyone else has pointed this out but using this on a weapon or armor piece that breaks easy (√ó6 packs for x amount of atoms is oddly just enough to repair a full suit) can really help someone out in sentinel armor just eating shots from people hoping to break their armor. I don't want to see these as usable items in the pvp death match style they are talking about.
---
+Karma Thank you so much for this!! üòÅ
---
It's not it opens on may 23rd I'm asking what are people's ideas on how it works and what the hole in the floor is for
---
Unfortunately, anyone who *actually* wanted to roleplay a raider in this game quit before it even launched. Because it wasn‚Äôt, and still isn‚Äôt possible. All you could do is have consensual duels. Since launch, they‚Äôve tweaked workshop pvp (didn‚Äôt help, just made it easy to exploit), and they added survival mode (also didn‚Äôt help, since it‚Äôs essentially just deathmatch mode).
---
Just about the ONLY raider thing you can do is take workshops. And that‚Äôs such a tiny part of the game, I don‚Äôt even think it counts. Typically, people are exploiting workshop pvp to kill the owner anywhere on the map, and not actually raiding the workshop...
---
Actually roleplaying a raider just isn‚Äôt fun, unfortunately. Anyone in their right mind would give up because of how boring it is. But assholes do sure like being assholes, whether it‚Äôs in game or out. It‚Äôs important to be able to tell the difference. Don‚Äôt worry about the stupid people, there‚Äôs plenty of good ones.
---
I reported this bug months ago but it has yet to be addressed. I used to use a gauss rifle and was willing to take the 12% damage hit to increase my energy resist but instantly noticed that it was the full 50% and not the 12% it states under effects. Just one of the many many bugs in the game that will never get resolved.
---
Ah, not bad then
---
I have a few in my bags, haven‚Äôt popped one yet, if it‚Äôs 30mins that‚Äôs pretty great
---
Probably get rid of suppression then, free up three points. Don‚Äôt really need it unless you‚Äôre specifically fighting large monsters that can chunk your HP
---
BTW the update this Tuesday made it so you can't do this unless your in PvP with said player. Although there are easy ways to bypass this pick there locks ect. But most importantly it happens you have everyright to be pissed but the game didn't do that to you your shit friends friend did
---
Train station battles are a lot of fun. You just need to run with weapon down as soon as you spawn.
---
If you reach damage &gt; 6.5\*DR, the weapon will be dealing the full paper damage. Anti-armor 2H melee weapons plus Incisor will routinely reach that level, except against the SBQ.
---
Thanks so much for the atoms! I‚Äôll put them to good use!
---
thanks. i really like that i can go peek!
---
It runs about 9600 at vendors, I believe.
---
Your welcome
---
The hole in the floor leads back to the sunken railway lines you came down to get to that area, I used to have a camp under the power pylons at the rear exit  of Blackwater mine, so when Uranium Fever popped up, I'd jump in the hole in the floor to get there quickly. Just look to the West before you jump in the hole otherwise you end back where you started.
---
I'll offer 3.5k.

Doing melee right now but only perked for heavy guns and carry weight

---
Bloody melee build? Some one call me? 
---
No lie.. its so op. Almost as annoying as guys that tse/instgate mobs before i can even get a hit.
---
Just another bug unfortunately. Happens in vats too.
---
Got plans for tonight?
---
I would agree if it was a survival server, that would make sense there.. but it really doesn't make sense in a normal server.
---
I'm just saying, having my base destroyed within the first two hours of coming back to the game sucks. I think having a base repair kit makes more sense than a repair kit for everything else. It would also reduce the negative effect of griefers, and be *some* sort of response from Bethesda to unwanted player behavior.
---
There's little reason to come back to the game as it stands, and anything to reduce the negative impact of some players doesn't negatively impact anyone else's gameplay, so why not?
---
Still don‚Äôt understand why this isn‚Äôt in the game at all, I was searching for months for this helmet, is it because it has actual use? I don‚Äôt understand the decision here

I‚Äôm on xbox. Would love some CAMP stuff.

Everytime I slow down and don't try and kill the sheep squash right away, we fail, because too many diseased bugs swarm the cows, the sheep squash is never more than 1* so it's not worth looting except for the crafting parts!

PS4 gonna grab a nuka cola quantum sign, power armour statue, and a mini death claw
---
The problem I've found is that it only goes up to a max of level 45. I really wish the game would allow us to craft a new version of quest reward items at least every 10 levels.
---
This is why I don't wait for other players to get a hit in anymore, the quest reward is more important, I'll 4 punch kill it for thr sake of ensuring the quest reward is dolled out!
---
The perfectly preserved pie spawns on the roof of west tek
---
yeah nah yeah
---
[removed]
---
They might as well reduce caps gained from pvp in adventure to 0. If people wanna pvp they should go to survival mode. 
---
The only reasons to pvp in adventure mod should be for fun, or to gain a workshop. As long as there is a cap reward for pvping people will try to exploit the mechanics to get the most out of it.
---
I've pretty much have only been doing west tek the past 2 weeks. I've gotten as many as 4 3* stars there. It's been quite consistent for me. I'm on ps4.

PS4 - Vault Tec Camp pack
---
You say "if workshops are pvp", do you think they're not?
---
But in 76 the 50 hunting rifle and the literal Barret 50 Cal Machine gun use the same cartridge...
---
I meant to say, I think the devs see "Oooh, this gun has 50 of the calibers, that sounds so sexy. Lets add it" without realizing that it makes no sense.
---
In Fo4, you could make the argument that the hunting rifle 50 receiver was using something like a 50 AE, or a 50 Beowulf. (Barring looking at the bullet model). So it could fit in that rifle.
---
But now that we have a machine gun and a rifle that use the same bullet... it makes no sense. Its the combat rifle and submachine gun firing ".45" all over again. Which .45? Like the old west, massive .45 Colt, or 45 ACP? (Made even more confusing by the fact that the lever gun now shoots ".45" and out-performs 308 hunting rifles)
---
Its like ordering a "beer" from a bartender. "Which one?" "Who gives a fuck, get me a beer". Thats the approach to bullets the BGS devs take.
---
TLDR, bullets don't make sense in this universe. Sledgehammers do more damage than tactical nuclear weapons ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
---
&gt; There's even a West Virginian professor over there who gives in-game historical tours
---
That's awesome... How the hell have I missed it?  Do you know names or common title words or something to search for?
---
Much obliged, wastelander
---
Definitely
---
Most definitely for that price. There‚Äôs a lot to explore and I would recommend playing ASAP so you can be higher level for the new content as it comes out. I collect tons of plans daily and still don‚Äôt have nearly everything, and I‚Äôm 750hrs in
---
The problem is this: the event rewards don‚Äôt compare to the amount lost actually trying to complete the event.
---
I use an auto rifle all the time. Here are my bullet costs (I use a pipe rifle btw, it‚Äôs my PvP humiliation build, sneaky as well)
---
SBQ: 1000-3000 rounds 
---
Imposter: 1000-2000 rounds (And 2000 caps)
---
Free range: 100ish rounds
---
WS run: 200ish rounds
---
Weapon Costs: I say zero cause it breaks once per week with licensed plumber.
---
Armor costs: Wood Armor baby, breaks once a week, only wood and adhesive and screws to repair.
---
I use a build that‚Äôs great at keeping costs low, but imagine if I used a .50 cal PA build. I‚Äôd shred through ammo and springs like no tomorrow. 
---
And this is all for... A chance at a good item and some other random stuff?
---
The costs compared to the rewards simply don‚Äôt add up to make the event worthwhile.  People half ass-ing these events are trying to minimize their losses.
---
Yes, currently it is more rewarding to gank unsuspecting workshop owners in adventure for their junk.
---
The first thing I do on any new character is craft and scrap a bunch of leather left arms for the mods. Deep pockets and ultra light are plan only though. Everything else is learnable by scrapping.
---
For any armor, you only need to scrap the cheapest variant, which is typically a light arm. That will unlock mods for the arms, legs, and chest.
---
You never miss out on mass or radiation fluids, that spawns on every body/meat pile when you come close in a blast zone, regardless on weigher you were involved or not!
---
Its happens aaaallllooooooottttt.
---
Thank you for your comments
---
They changed it to where you have to do the falsely accused quest first. Wander around the toxic valley until you get attacked by a group of gutsy wardens, they will drop a holotape that says something about a mass break out at the prison, which will start the quest to go talk to the warden, which will lead to the patrol duty quest.
---
Why not just have a free non-hostile 3 star legendary spawn in our camps every time we fast travel there? In fact, let‚Äôs skip the enemy and just give everyone a free legendary roll every time they fast travel anywhere. 
---
Because legendaries are supposed to be hard to get. Yes, it‚Äôs not perfect the way it is, I agree, but that‚Äôs precisely why we need these kinds of balance changes.
---
I achieve 100% penetration quite often.
---
Now that is interesting. There's probably lore in the form of holotapes ot something at the same location explaining why too.
---
Not everyone‚Äôs got a quad explosive shotgun friend.

This ^  It‚Äôs a back door basically. There are a few spaces that aren‚Äôt flooded.
---
You might not have been carrying alot of junk, but many, many people I have ambushed in workshops have dropped literally hundreds of pounds of junk, not to mention their level in caps. If your going to use workshops build a stash and store your junk

I would like something other than ghouls to farm for legendaries, but Watoga was kinda bs since as long as you completed mayor for a day the robots were passive. Just strolling around killing the legendaries with out any other opposition was more than a little unfun we something like watoga but hostile.
---
I agree. I think this helps a huge deal. Except for the fact all those mole miners in blackwater were dead 100% of the time :D
---
I rarely ever saw legendaries in Watoga, but I'm annoyed that I'll never get the chance to...
---
A couple of points in Fireproof is almost essential unless you're running a Dense torso, in which case it's still pretty good. The Scorchbeast sonic blast is explosive damage.
---
Serendipity is really good once you're below 35% hp. You may find you need it even if you're trying to run 50%.
---
Scorchbeasts will land on their own, at least if they don't get confused by the terrain. Crippling their wings usually takes a few more perks, so there's a limited point in shooting at them with a melee build unless they refuse to land. PER 3 isn't a terrible idea though. I run secondary rifle with my bloodied shotgun build and it's punchy enough with adrenal reaction. Useful for thinning out the enemies before you yolo in.
---
I‚Äôve attacked workshops before but only people in triple digits and I keep their junk on me until they leave. That way they can get it back. They never do, but the opportunity is there.
---
You‚Äôre right. There‚Äôs pvp, where it‚Äôs fair, and there‚Äôs cowardice. The people who kill you whilst you have no chance to defend yourself and then switch servers are the same people that get angry at the employees who stop them from stealing chocolate bars at their local shops.
---
No this is an old video if it has been changed I haven't seen it. I also didn't know you could pa glitch into there. What does the stash look like now ?
---
Would be nice, but I'm pretty sure we can't due to limitations with multiplayer (bugging out, etc). I'd settle for a spiral staircase though
---
Happens all the time, also being waaaay out of the enemies‚Äô melee range and still getting hit.
---
Thank you!
---
Yep
---
Probably it's the same idea you mentioned about it using a .50 Beowulf-like bullet as far as power goes and then the 50 Cal MG using the actual 50 BMG, or they both use a less powerful 50 Cal compared to our world.
---
And honestly I don't mind various weapons sharing ammunitions despite not making much sense, something like this is basically something you have to accept when it comes to Survival and Battle Royale games anyway.
---

Like this (Captainoob weapon spotlight): https://youtu.be/-ve63Hj4jSU

Find out which side quests reward you with unique named weapons, and do them after lvl 50. You dont wanna end up with a really good ‚Äúyou only get it once‚Äù unique weapon that is locked at a low level, making it useless once you reach endgame. All Rise, rewarded from the Mayor for a Day quest in Watoga is a good example.
---
Whitesprings because I have a sense of style.
---
Teddy bear and skeleton scenes are my favorite thing in fallout. So great
---
I always try to be as out of the way as possible. Don't want to accidentally mess up farming areas and gain attention of griefers. 
---
Water and a nice view are high priorities as well!
---
I bought it for 30$ about a month ago. Still having a good time

This weeks codes just expired 42 minutes ago. Also, you don't need code pieces to launch a nuke, just know the code itself.

Great pic.

Weird, blue/yellow and straps, like it put back together with spare parts. Ya, you can get in, had alot of practice in FO4 getting that PA in nuka world.

Nighttime was never pitch black, even during the Beta....and with the Pip-Boy light available to every player exiting Vault 76, our maps, quest waypoints, and lit landmarks every 50ft like the MoonShiner's Shack, Lumber Mill, and Overseer's Camp, and Responder church, it could not have been that tough following the large...paved road to Flatwoods and completing the 2 quests there at night.
---
I feel like people have missed the point of the day/night cycle so much, they should just remove it altogether and make it noon around the clock.  Nighttime was meant to present it's own challenges, and we were given tools like lights, headlamps, flares, NV, and the Night Eyes perk to tackle them.  Nighttime is supposed to be more difficult to navigate than daytime.  But now, it's basically the same as day with some tint changes and a starry sky.

---
When pacifist camps can no longer be damaged in adventure, whitespring turret bases are going to have a field day. Bethesda said they fixed the camp spawn areas but clearly they haven‚Äôt. They moved camps out of ‚Äúarea of future content‚Äù but left white spring lawns. 
---
I get that people in adventure didn‚Äôt want to farm extra steel, wood, and flux, but there‚Äôs a benefit to being able to destroy trolly, asshole camps. It‚Äôs going to be interesting to see what structures griefers come up with, while they leave pacifist on for their camps and can still hunt people out in workshops for the pvp they want. 
---
At least in survival you can still tear down structures that are spammed with mob farming turrets, 10x sirens, and camps built to block native structures from players (you‚Äôd be surprised how many unmarked locations you can do that to). 
---
What happens when someone who has built a trap base locks you in, and you‚Äôve spawned a mole rat under their foundation so you can‚Äôt fast travel out? (Has happened to me) You just... hop servers?
---
Multi person Charlie's angels pose ftw

Not really, just the longevity of the weapon. If you‚Äôre fighting the sheep or the queen it will definitely break in the battle if you don‚Äôt use it.

There was one camp right behind the golf club that had to of had over 100 turrets.  How is that even possible?

I have weapon weight reducing perk cards (like the one that reduces shotgun weight and lets you load them faster, and the one that reduces melee weight and lets you swing them faster), and I bought a weapon weight reducing armor piece. When I equipped the armor piece my weight went down by 7 pound. So in my case both DID make a difference. FYI.
---
It‚Äôs all over PC. It escaped from the Dev Room. You learn it instantly by scrapping it. Personally, I think Bethesda is too lazy to either A: completely remove it from PC or B: add it to consoles. It‚Äôs sad honestly.
---
Plus with the right meats like; yogi ribs +10% melee dmg, glowing meat steak +10% melee dmg, mutton chops +10% melee dmg, sting wing meat, +10% melee dmg, mutant hound meat steaks +10% melee dmg. It's a lot of work but just giving you ideas. Good luck to you. Any other questions let me know.
---
Yeah
---
Raiders....yup definitely raiders...
---
Check your inventory and see if you got them somehow, you're supposed to craft those two parts together at a tinker bench--one is the plane transponder and another is in the derailed train cars just north of NAR (the cars with the gutsys and other military bots around)

As soon as the lengedary vendor and player vending is up ill be by the legendary vendor in berkley springs. Til the, im on the road outside whitesprings.

Yes they stack with each other. I saw the same results. But did you equip any of the gun specific perk cards too? Did those stack with the armor?

Thanks

Under the highway beside Thunder Mountain Power Plant. Not even people walking by it even notices it's a player structure. The only problem is the scorched on TMPP always shoot at my camp and it's annoying

With bear arms you kinda need no secondary though, as you can carry five more heavy weapons for the weight of one rifle.

750 hrs in, similar backstory regarding moving camps. I started wanting to have an interesting looking shop that people utilize a couple months ago and have been perfecting a simple yet interesting design ever since. What I sell there has always taken a backseat to the overall design and aesthetic of the shop. I knew if I had a good location, people would come. So I chose the Whitespring Station. It‚Äôs close enough to Whitespring and just out of the nuke zone, it gets a crazy amount of foot traffic regularly. Even when I‚Äôm away I‚Äôll see dots at my camp checking everything out. And when I get behind the vendor window, a line usually forms. It‚Äôs the perfect spot!
---
Damn, great point!

4k is what I‚Äôm selling it for.

The only weight cards I know of for the shotgun are the shotgunner (?) one with WWR and reload speed, and Martial Artist for melee with WWR and SS. I have level 1 of the shotgun one and level 2 of the melee one. When I added the armor piece my weight went down 7 lbs.
---
I wonder about maximizing damage with stealth/V.A.T.S? Maybe something akin to this:

---
Name one net positive change they've left out.
---
That happens sometimes! But other times it seems they go through the floor or outright disappear
---
It's generally frowned upon as a camp spot, yeah. That's why I built mine on the nearby cliff over by the watchtower; still nearby, just outside the nuke radius usually and with a good view of the course. The turrets I have aren't pointed at the course either.
---
It's just lazy to put one next to the club. Yeah, it may have given you a pile of loot back before the WS nerfs, but now it's just tasteless.
---
Well played
---
Excuse me?
---
Yeah, when I got the game, I thought that 8 gb of RAM would be sufficient, as I can run other games with it seamless (GTA V, Doom 2016, etc). I also thought that since I can run Fallout 4 at High settings at 80 fps, I could run this game at High settings with similar fps. 
---
Boy, was I wrong :/
---
Or an option so that you have to hold the button to interact.
---
I've had this happen on xb1 and pc, usually a relog/cache clear will fix it, but you may simply have to get someone else to speak and it'll go away
---
I have met Gary as well. He really likes that pile of cars over near Whitespring.
---
I just made all my armor deep pocketed cant wait till I can hold around 400 pounds then if i wear my excavator with calibrated shocks plus backpack i can hold around 600
---
I have fdc armor pieces. When I equip through hiker, weight absolutely goes down. I run rifles so I can test perk cards stacking with weapons but food works
---
bloody melee myself, i carry a tesla for tagging when I am not alone.
---
rad away is cheap, and so is carrying an auto pistol and a few rounds.
---
It isn't rocket science to NOT one shot everything from the roof.
---
ROFL, you act like POE doesn't hand out free respecs like crazy. You say they don't mid season, sure, but their seasons are what? 3 months? Then everyone gets a respec?
---
Yes those. And there is one for pistols and heavy weapons. You had those perk cards you mentioned equipped, and the armor still helped?
---
had that happen on ps4 as well,  even restarting the app didn't fix it
---
Star Wars Galaxies, old MMO from 03.
---
I would wholly agree with that, however in my 100+ levels and 200+ hours I have never found a TSE. I have an explosive rifle but not a two-shot explosive. If you have one laying around I'll pay caps for it ;)
---
I got this a few days ago and cant seem to fund it anwhere to place it. ?
---
Kind sir I barely found strenght to read it all. Obviously carry on with this conversation is pointless. Unfortunately some points You made are not very much grown up. Ill leave it at that. 
---
Have a good day sir!
---
Yes, both cards equipped, added armor piece, weight went down 7 lbs.
---
Medic or vampire guns work well too. If you actually try with this game you can beat any challenge.
---
Once I saw 4 Gary‚Äôs at the golf course
---
THIS!
---
Not usually. You're making it sound like they give out dozens of respecs a year, they give maybe one or two.
---
I've had as many as 3 stuck there (PC) when the sheepsquatch event was going strong.  I believe it happens when you log out of a server when someone is talking.
---
And yes, quitting out all the way and restarting will clear them.  Hopping servers doesn't.
---
There's some truth in that. I don't think the game was ever going to be full-on PvP. Bethesda knew there would be griefers and they seemed pretty intent on trying to diminish it as much as they could. I'll have my wits about me next time it happens, but hopefully I just keep running into chill players like usual.
---
"I wonder what I could build here..." Is all it took for my current spot.
---
I've used some camps just for the nodes (looking at you junk/lead combo spot), but eventually you'll probably want to set down somewhere with a good view, or a good spot fast travel wise (cost to/from your farming areas)
---
That said, I already have my eye on a few places once vending comes out, I'll probably make a roadside workshop and actual shop for passers by when that happens
---
It's been said already but thanks a ton. Hundreds if not thousands of nukes have been launched because of Nukacrypt, which probably makes you the most important person in this entire community. Excellent work mammal!
---
That update already hit? I thought it was coming with the player vendoring one. Awesome though, wont have to jump server everytime another player gets near my base lol
---
Where is it available for $13? Thanks!
---

---
Is this near what my hunter is running minus the perks I took for personal taste. The way I figure it is go for a one shot if able and if not try to cripple a leg for safety. 
---
Vats is ok if you can rock a double or quad model for follow up shots. 
---
My current loadout is a junkies crippling crossbow, an exterminators hunting rifle, a hunters machete and a ton of throwing knives.
---
Maryland Heights above Harper's Ferry because I wanted my camp in Maryland
---
Are you running a bloodied build with nerd rage?  I have a similar build except for that and adrenaline junkie.
---
There was a dbl dp weekend ? Damm no body told me! :(
---
So cool to see my friends make the front page of r/fo76 sadly I didn't make it to this vending party but I look forward to seeing you all next time!
---
My sniper weighs 18.6 lbs (no weight reduction for them).  That's not quite in the 'light' category.
---
Yes I run Nerd Rage, Adrenaline Reaction Mutation and Emergency Protocol on XO 1 with the above stated guns.
---
You don't need to be "creative", you just need to put a tiny bit of effort.
---
Workshops are much to slow to require you to stay there to get the benefits, they are supposed to be capture and forget. 
---
Maybe if you leave, someone else can take it, and there is no repercussions, finders keepers, I think that might be extreme but it‚Äôs not terrible.
---
Alright man...
---
Submit a ticket and wait I guess. They moved quick on carry weight cause it's easy to measure, this might be harder to get unless several tickets report it.
---
Also, put the explosive weapons away while shooting at mobs by the Brahmin.
---
this was near summersville lake
---
There is no way you can make blueprints work like that. They are borderline useless.
---
I use nuka as my preferred healing method. I use a medic gun and herbivore buffed razorgrain soup for spot healing between fights. 
---
I would recommend that and learning how to alter how you play if you need to spam stims. You can't treat nuka like stims. The quantity is just not there. 
---
Dyer chemical, red rocket mega stop, whitesprings outdoor area has a lot of random spawns and inside the enclave bunker is a bunch of spawns too.
---
There was a report someone did on this a few months ago. Google it and you should be able to find it.
---
Depends on the character for me. 
---
My main is out of the way parked on a crystal vein for lasers and the like. 
---
My hunter is in an area that gives a great view and is secluded enough to feel like a hunter
---
My big iron gunslinger is on a main road for others can resupply and whatnot. 
---
And my cannoneer is currently sitting a lead deposit for cannonball making.
---
Alright man I just need to do this dm me where it is... I‚Äôm so desperate
---
Same I think we can all related to the stupidity it our decision to go through the right half of the desert in New Vegas. Never again lmao.
---
Not ski ball, skull ball
---
I think the first problem is the second someone challenges your workshop you are vulnerable to them and anyone in their team, and so most likely when someone challenges your workshop you will have no warning and your dead.  For PVE players this doesn‚Äôt even give you a chance to go into the menu and disable pacifist mode, and so you basically have  no chance to win. 
---
I‚Äôd like at least a short countdown timer where you are warned that someone is challenging your workshop.  This would give you time to flip game modes and maybe even get your perks ready.
---
That was fast
---
I will only settle on a spot with a material collector and water access.
---
It's basically a feature at this point. 
---
Same with reloading when you login
---
I was one of this games biggest supporters, until Bethesda nerfed everything.
---
Seriously there sure be a reddit for 76 screenshots/characters specifically
---
It can spawn either as light sturdy or heavy and the only way to tell if its heavy when its legendary is the weight and damage resistance
---
Looking good br√∂ther
---
Anything for reference? Like what‚Äôs the typical weight for heavy
---
I recorded it and translated it. It never gave any coordinates, just repeated the message. Gonna try killing it next time like Ne0nP1nk recommended.
---
"You should definitely talk to the murder church guy" Is a great recommendation for any phase of life
---
Theres a spread sheet i dont have the link and i dont have all the stats memorised
---
Well alright thanks
---
Prime receiver helps.  The ultracite bolts are made from fluorescent flux so they are not overly hard to get . With bloody I can get the damage to 350-400 or so.  It's not as good as a rifle but it's definitely fun to play.
---
Where do you get the plans?
---
If I remember right I want to say it had the name Marcus in the title. You do mean the holotape in the computer by the throne right?
---
How is pointing out that I'm talking about the bugged challenges in my OP toxic?
---
If you got a good roll 3\* and sold it to another player, otherwise no it's just a cap sink.
---
Highly doubt it'll come back
---
To just give them the full suit of excavator? I doubt it. The part where you run them through the quest? Yeah probably, I was just thinking out loud mostly with that part. LOL
---
Thought about TSE or Instigating? Both are fun and work pretty well still
---
Pearly Peepers?
---
I love this idea. There was this beautiful place on the water in the mountains, made me completely rethink things. Would love a way to tell them that.
---
5 pieces of sentinel armor and pinning yourself in a position where you can't be staggered into moving. Go watch the user glorf12 do it without using a single stimpack. I basically copy that build.
---
In another 1000 hours perhaps I too, could solo things.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Until 2021, multiplayer it is!
---
This is a solid comment.     The military super lizard is only -just- beginning to reach its reign.    Give it the decades between now and NV and it‚Äôs got a lot of rapid evolution and breeding to do
---
Does Quick Hands work on xbow?
---
I swear I was recently thinking the same thing. I played since launch and now started to notice that nights really aren't dark enough. I have a feeling they changed it to maybe improve game performance but that's just a feeling. I really wish nights were darker.
---
Damn, nice. So Bloodied is the way to go?
---
I have the exact same build lol with 3* Unyielding Sentinel
---
Except I‚Äôm level 163 and have all the perks plus endgame weapons 
---
The pylons ignore DR, you just gave yourself away when you said you didn‚Äôt use a stimpack lol
---
Uh, My friends and I are reverse engineering the server software and are going to release it for free like other mods and let you run it on your own pc or server like a mincraft server. How exactly is bethesda going to make money from that?
---
You get them from one of the lying Lowe quests not sure which one.
---
I think it might be Message to...
---
With the name of the lady with the 'rebels' that were leaving the burrows. Not at home for a few hours, but I'll have a dig later
---
Yes. Not as much as I‚Äôd like but it does help when it does. It‚Äôs way better on a double of quad.
---
I really like the backpacks. Currently all my favorite outfits have backpacks, so I wonder how they'll interact graphically. The lil mothman one is adorable and weird. As far as making room....Really just want the player vending, and legendary vendor. xD
---
It is from my understanding of the software from helping create "skyrim with friends" and currently reverse engineering the server software fo76 is currently running to release private servers, with better stability than the ones currently being run by bethesda.
---
Thank you for all you do.
---
Yea, that‚Äôs just such a low probability that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth tying anymore :( every time I even thought I got something good it ended up actually being a low-leveled item I actually got from one of the adds :(
---
The biggest issue with nights at the moment is that for the last 3 patches the lighting engine is just fucked!

I usually go for marsupial, adrenal reaction, healing factor, and speed demon. You need four points in luck for this. 2 starched genes and 2 in class freak.
---
Heads up! Someone just posted the codes for silo Charlie.
---
I didn't say I didn't use stimpacks, I said watch glorfs video of him doing it, he doesn't use stimpacks, it is that build I am using.
---
When I played they gave out 3 respecs in a 5 month span.
---
I didn't check first before posting. Sorry if it doesn't work that way.
---
What about the pearly pepers if I‚Äôm correct the binoculars that track enemies
---
Lvl up, explore the great wasteland, get lost in the map without using your map to get home ie drink some nukashine
---
Yes but you are talking about being melee, they aren't. Those builds are glass cannons, they can't tank anything and literally have so many points into boosting damage from stealth, and most are running instigating weapons so full life mobs take double damage.
---
You get recipes daily from Biv.
---
Which one will be a primary weapon?
---
Around level 50, I grinded enough caps for a post-nerf tse Combat Shotgun from the market. I already had a shotgun build, but that totally changed the game for me. With enforcer and demo expert added, it cripples almost anything and does crazy splash damage.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but you log into the location in survival where you last logged off, no matter if it's in PvP or PvE.
---
So either move your CAMP somewhere out of the way, or just log out in PvE somewhere quiet (with the right benches), then log into PvP and do your thing.  I gathered all my mats for this week's challenge, logged out in my CAMP in the boonies, and did the PvP stuff in a few minutes.  No one around for miles.
---
I actually took a picture of me with Gary last night, quite the charming fellow.
---
They are hard workers :)
---
whats ur PSN?
---
I agree with this list. Grounded is a good one to have if you're not using energy weapons and Chameleon has no negative effects.
---
I don't know the weights, but base limb resistances are 12/12, 15/15 and 20/20 for level 50. Torsos are 36/36, 47/47 and 61/61.
---
Wish it wouldn't say they were surpressed then.
---
Had a couple of jerks unloading into my low level friends with bloodied explosive gatling plasma, I just encouraged them to not fight back so that those idiots would just waste their expensive ammo!
---
As good a guess as any.  Time will tell!
---
The melee card only reduces by 60%. So perhaps there is a cap of 90% and the cards and armor stack to that limit? I'll try getting a full set of weapon reduction to test.
---
How did you build floors sticking out from foundations? I cant seem to figure that out.
---
Yeah, it's straight up disrespectful. I spent about 2 hours teaching one of my friends how to launch a nuke [from start to finish]. I went back to my C.A.M.P to repair my weapons, he was there waiting for it to land, and then a few seconds after it landed,  that player's C.A.M.P spawned in and started going to town - it was definitely coordinated between a team. There was a player standing there on watch - as soon as I or someone else closed those double doors, he would open them right away. We kept shooting him, he wasn't engaging, therefore it didn't matter what we did - we were the ones who laughed it...
---
Hello. So are you thru hiker and pharmacy fully ranked 3? If so, then u have reached 90% weight reduction FDC.  According to your test, no perk card on u out two FDC armor pieces on and saw 40% weight reduction. Then u added the perk cards back with no further weight reduction? 
---
Whatever it is, there is a cap of 90% weight reduction.  The only benefit for running 5 pieces of 20% FDC weight reducing armor is so that you don‚Äôt need to use perk cards. It‚Äôs saves 3 strength and 3 agility cards u can use for something else. That‚Äôs the way I saw it when I did my own tests before.
---
Get me those minecraft looking beacons in fo76 rn!
---
Grounded is my fifth. I‚Äôm not online to look rn.
---
even though they use .45 ammo in the game, It seems like Bethesda set the damage and ammo capacity to a 22 inch 45-70 lever action. 
---
This would be the only lever action that has a 4+1 ammo capacity and damage greater than a .308.  This satisfies the reason why the lever gun holds 5 and does way way way more damage than the hunting rifle. 
---
Someone come up with a non fantasy land answer haha. Because a standard 18 inch .45 lever action I‚Äôm pretty sure is 8+1  ammo and the 20inch 30-30 is 5+1 ammo capacity
---
I've run through a few walls in the game due to the engine chugging and failing to load in chunks in time, never, its gotten me inside buildings, camps, under Watoga, and the legendary vender!
---
I got tired of doing Rifleman with tesla rifle + AA radium rifle, got a TS 10mm smg and decided to switch to commando and do an armor pen/full auto VATS build. Took a few levels before I noticed it but the damage potential looks like it‚Äôs going to eclipse a 9-stack rifleman card bonus
---
I'd love it to be set in the pacific northwest, or maybe Alaska
---
I ran around farming XP when I was lower level at the Whitespring resort. All you had to do is tap the high level ghouls there with a pistol, and you get XP and loot. Its a good way to get out of the early game rut of sawed off hunting rifles and pipe weapons. One player, who was using an alt-right moniker, decided to let me follow him, letting me hit the ghouls first before he killed them. He even gave me a little bit of free stuff. My lizard brain eagerly accepted this, feeling that reptile tickle of reward in the back of my skull, despite that this person was probably some sort of disgusting white nationalist.
---
Eventually, this power armored high level player picks a fight with the Whitespring security bots, while he is unfortunately standing next to some cars. The bots shred him and the cars next to him explode, bringing him to his knees, downed and at death‚Äôs door. I walked up, and my first instinct was to revive him, but being a low level player, I didn‚Äôt have any stimpaks. Not a single one.
---
Being new and not knowing what to do in this situation, I button mashed and ended up gunbashing him. He had actually had a bounty on him, and this killed him and awarded me a decent amount of caps. It was when I looked at the man‚Äôs paper bag treasure trove of junk that I truly began to sweat. ‚ÄúOh f#%k.‚Äù My face straightened with both disbelief and disgust at the moral dilemma I faced. Could I really betray and steal from this player, who had been kind to me, taken me under his wing, protected me, and even given me gifts, even if he was some kind of internet nazi-lite?
---
Of course I could. I grabbed that huge cache and hauled it to safety, dumped it in my stash, and switched servers like a conniving filthy coward.
---
Here you go, here is where I got the build from he solo's her in  90 second without using a stimpack, only nukacolas.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bcvvmy/encryptid_event_solo_guidetips/
---
Great work. 
---
One thing to look at is throwing knives and tomahawks. While they are odd a few can help kill a low health target without wasting a few bullets.
---
I've always been a builder. In fo4 I spent hours at different settlements building, and now in fo76 I also enjoy building. I have a mansion that I built and whenever people come by, they leave some alcohol as a gift.
---
I can't imagine it would never come back.
---
When it will come back, I have no idea. There is a similar one coming out soon for the War Rider that has similar aesthetics that might hold you over till Bone Raider comes back though.
---
What system?
---
Shit, thought I put that in there, PS4
---
...and also Jane Fonda was there.
---
Dang it im on Xbox and I have two...
---
That sucks for real, but why do you even let it sit in the inventory? So many times when I'm swamped with enemies I just grab whatever legendary drops, I'll let go of it later if it's shit but why take the chance?
---
Yeah and that‚Äôs a pretty typical thing. People try to start PvP fights and you just don‚Äôt respond if you don‚Äôt want to. And yes they totally waste their ammo!!
---
The same bug can happen with your own tag, or the exp bar!
---
It wasn‚Äôt about letting it sit, I was literally inspecting what the second perk was and then suddenly poor, lol
---
I just found out from my daughter the alien I was steering you to didn‚Äôt work for her on the challenge. 
---
The only live alien I‚Äôve seen is the flatwoods monster
---
Alaska would be cool especially since a large part of the war was fought there
---
From your inventory or from the dead enemies inventory?
---
If you‚Äôre willing to front the caps cost, I imagine you could post something like:
---
(Platform) Have circuit board ready, sign up here for pylons! Can launch when 3 slots and 1 backup filled.
---
(Backups in case of no shows or disconnects)
---
.
---
If that‚Äôs somehow against the policy or spirit of subreddit, apologies. But I would definitely smack a pylon if someone went to the trouble to pay and organize...
---
Is adrenal worth it? I‚Äôve always thought that‚Äôs the Bloodied thing to have?
---
Enemies, but still, it was damn near 3 seconds haha
---
I'm on PC, and FO76 runs pretty well -- I would be inclined to agree more that somehow lag may have resulted in me dropping something if it didn't happen exactly to the same type of weapon in the same slot.  But who knows?
---
Yeah ,you right never saw them on Xbox and never saw a helmet www with damage r√©sistance..this remind me if the true Fallout üòå
---
yeah definitely not in my inventory -- I checked very thoroughly as they were a pain to get.
---
But hasn't it been less then an hour (as of my original comment)
---
Ultracite by far T-51 is Below T-60 X-01 And Ultracite all Max level. Just look up the stats but Ultracite is by far better stat wise.
---
Well now you know, try my method next time, might leave you with less carry weight, but worth it in the end.
---
I mean, if you're looking for a lawsuit, that's a pretty good way to get one. I'm not sure if I believe you, but either way there's a big difference between a mod that makes an offline game something you can connect to, and stealing server software that a company is actively using to make money.
---
Cave Cricket: *chirping sounds*
---
The damage cap is nice to know, kinda unfortunate that vats crits ignore damage resistance. I run a super weird nerd rage melee PA that is neigh invulnerable just until they press that vats crit button then it's all over. 
---
The handmade is one of the best but pretty sure top contender is the explosive Lazers/plasma rifles. Doesn't seem they have any damage drop off so they can be miles away and kill you and they burn thru any kind resistance feels like your wearing paper. Most of the guys I know that have one won't even use it (unless the folks were fighting uses one) because of how trivial it makes pvp. They really need to figure out what their doing with them because they're way to strong
---
Starched genes takes away most of the negative effects, and it‚Äôs surprisingly useful during large fights when adrenaline perks are in effect and you‚Äôre taking a lot of hits.
---
Yup! If one guy pre-clears the silo and another farms the code pieces you can start trying codes right around the half hour mark. Depending on load times for farming the code pieces.
---
From there if the solution is near the top of the list it can be pretty quick.
---
T51b has most defense, ultracite is an mix of t51 and x-01
---
I did consider those, but they‚Äôre only 100 damage. They‚Äôre slow and take a lot of skill to use, since you have to hit multiple times. 
---
Vats is much more reliable in terms to killing enemies, and it works much more efficiently.
---
It would not be a bad idea to carry them, but they‚Äôre not optimal due to the terrible charge up time for grenades.
---
Use Vats at that point.
---
Survival is PVP based and any non event team or team player will be considered hostile and should always be considered survival mode is for those wanting PVP or a ‚Äúwasteland‚Äù style play never trust anyone but if you‚Äôd like to show your base you should stick to adventure mode and PS. pacifist in survival is a bad idea
---
What does grounded do? I might look into Chameleon though!
---
Everything will come back eventually, don't worry. We already saw two items return to the store, it's just a very shallow marketing ploy to get you to buy things quickly .. don't fear.
---
Well hot damn! Was not aware of that! Thank you!
---
Something. Anything to alleviate my panicked thumb....üòú
---
West Tek, White Spring and the burrows (especially when nuked), everything else was nerfed to hell.
---
I just start shouting in game chat and ordering people around, most of them do the event because it spawns but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve completed the sheepsquatch quest line...because they all shoot at it while it‚Äôs invisible.  And free range is just sad, everyone tries to herd the cows and others don‚Äôt help take out the enemies so the cows die before even getting to the range.  It‚Äôs hilariously sad üòÇ
---
I believe perception and agility directly affect stealth the most.
---
I have an agility of 30-45 and when standing I can be seen from I think 100 meters away. When crouched as long as I wasn't aimed at and in a sight cone of another player, I am invisible.
---
However, if perception is anything like previous Fallout's, it will determine how far away blips are detected and when a combat instance will start (Combat music plays, every hostile is instantly engaged, any perks that are combat related kick in) so having a higher perception than opponents agility should in theory make them way more detect able
---
100 meters is 109.36 yards
---
Yeah okay, I think it's fairly well known.
---
Phoenix: Bring it to Watoga, bitches. Half price sale on body parts from cocky cryptids..
---
Great. Can I have all your loot
---
My first run throuvh at wt today..2 3*s...got 2 wood armor 1*s.  Did about 10 run throughz..best drop i got a 3* bloodied single action.tons of 1* vendor itema lol. Too bad about watoga.
---
Water access and away from people. I'm always on the south end of the map in the mountains
---
"I have no need to prove anything" says the person claiming a bunch of crap that isn't true. Uh huh. You can't, end of story.
---
I one shot everything, and with gun-fu kills are quick. 
---
Reloading is also fast. An increase to the mag would then ask devs to nerf the gun damage. 
---
Don‚Äôt nerf my Lever Action!
---
‚ÄúArms held oooout, in your jesus christ pose‚Äù.
---
That‚Äôs happened to me basically every time on the encrypted event. The imposter falls into the earth and then I have to wait like 5 minutes for his metal corpse scrap pile to float back up to the surface for some fresh air to get my legendary wood chest piece.
---
These are always the guys who are garbage at survival too.
---
Gary?
---
It sounds like our findings are the same. No 99% or 100% reduction. Bummer!
---
You‚Äôre amazing
---
Heck yeah.
---
Lasers are great weapons because of this range, and the Laser splitter is a bit broken right now. They are meta guns, but they don‚Äôt sneak well unless they‚Äôre explosive, which hides the actual laser. They operate at extreme distance well, but they fall flat when the target is closer. Play defensive and bait laser users.
---
The idea is to stay hidden. I‚Äôve fought lots of laser lads and beat them every time. Their main advantage is prefire and covering a field. 
---
Legacy lasers should honestly be removed from the game, but the Faster fire rate weapons are much more lethal in the grand scheme of things.
---
Thanks, I'm glad you think so. :)
---
Well I need to keep 3 for perception for different things, butcher's bounty when I'm tick farming, lock pick skills for lock picking and so forth. It really is a utility slot that gets loaded with what I need at the time. 
---
If no one is around in a nuke zone I'm using the gatling, else I'm spraying with a basic rifle. Still trying to find the tesla rifle though
---
I mean, you could just search "stealth buff" in the text box

Surprisingly enough, I don't remember specific minor fixes from months ago, but these are just a few of the examples. It's mostly simple stuff like CAMP glitches, UI issues, etc. Go look for them yourself if you want more
---
Or on holiday weekends
---
I was unintentionally one of those people a few weeks ago. I took a couple of minutes pondering if I wanted to do it or go to bed, said what the hell, and fast traveled to the overlook. In the amount of time it took me to get in my power armor and usea MedX and Super Stimpak the event finished. I don‚Äôt know who those glorious bastards were that took down Sheepsquatch in a matter of just a few minutes, but DAMN I was impressed.
---
GARY
---
HAHA! GARY!
---
Depends on how resistant ole sheepy is to poison.
---
Both. It's not super rare, but still quite uncommon to get 1 outside, and I haven't seen a legendary out back yet. The majority I get inside. Of all things, a few days ago I had the suicider spawn as a 3*.
---
I typically get at least one 3* super mutant per run, and it's probably like a 25% chance of there not being one at all, at least in my experience.
---
i‚Äôm very glad that someone got the reference
---
Will he survive the next one?
---
When playing melee I‚Äôm a bit of a Neanderthal and noisy as hell. I was clanking around a rooftop in Whitesprings when a silenced rifle shot right at my feet. No idea how long he had been there but it was meant as ‚Äú Quiet down!‚Äù
---
Took me a while to find him. He was getting shots in as I played and I thought the game was glitching. Sneaky man, very.
---
Nope, they are gone and can't get them from the world or craft them somehow. :/
---
Dunno but i gave tried the mayor for a day part where i have to upload the virus.. lots of bots pop up there.. and a friggin scorchbeast.. 
---
Just want my all rise..

Grreat job dude! Keep up the good work!
---
White spring Marjory nerfed to for anything more than 1 Star
---
What can i say? I love Fallout 3. It was the First Fallout i played
---
So, as boring and cheesy as this is, just do what I did. Save up about a thousand caps, go to Whitespring and buy out the soda fountain vendor on the second floor (past the bar, off the pink ball room,) then server hop and repeat. I started hoarding grapes for rads, my god -1200 is nuts, and oranges, wilds, and darks to drink for water and that sweet, sweet buff. Party Girl mixed with Cola Nut gives a +6 str +6 end boost to Nuka Dark and they're great paired with some chems, plus do a whopping 85% thirst.
---
Fair enough haha
---
Odd, I've heard about it a little, yet with my alt using primary melee, I don't have problem.
---
With my main using guns, I don't really know if Im actually even hitting them, but oh boy do I miss a lot of shots. The AI movement seems too erratic and hard to track and lead. I know my eye-hand coordination isn't great, but in most games I'm about average. Here, I constantly have to use vats way too often to my taste. I think it's because of medicore aim, erratic movement, low performance computer and mobile connection.
---
It only shows Abbies Bunker, because there's a tinker's workbench there where I could repair the uplink.
---
Add me to your will, too. Thanks!
---
Fair point. If not mistaken doesn‚Äôt the hunting rifles first mag upgrade only offer one more round?
---
For the lever I‚Äôd be ok with a 5 round small and an 8 round large IF Bethesda states that this model in fallout 76 is using the .45-70 round. 
---
The cowboy repeater in FNV is what 7 standard and 11? upgraded? Granted it‚Äôs firing a .357 magnum round. But most of the lever family guns are interchangeable so it wouldn‚Äôt be that far off in terms of right?
---
If this model we have is a ‚Äúbig game rifle‚Äù as it seems to be I‚Äôd even be happy with ammo swap for say something like the 30 .06 or equivalent. That way the dps stays the same and the ammo as well but if not it should feel more like its real world representation.
---
some more pics of my new place
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/pBDPRvJ](https://imgur.com/gallery/pBDPRvJ)
---
There is always a chance of missing but this is ridiculous. This is NOT the way to nerf melee.
---
Yup. Also add in legendary power armor parts. Let us add mods to the legendary parts. 
---
And fuck sakes.. lower the power cost of the jet pack.. i wanna fly farther about!! Not ironman but.. cmon man..
---
He can not win even with cheating His new name is HRC2016
---
Yes please, this would be great!
---
I watched a scorchbeast beat a sheepsquatch if that's any consolation. Frickin' spamming screams.
---
I fought a lvl 80 sheepsquatch (1 or 2 star idk) along with the help of a mutant with a minigun. I ran out of ammo since my guns eats ammo real quick and was down to a melee weapon.  My character isn't a melee build so it did a max if 80 damage. It was pretty fun
---
Charming.
---
Aggressive turrets attract aggressive players, and when everyone is a walking tank at lv 80, my lv 5 turrets won't do anything but hold back NPCs. At this point in the games life cycle, I don't feel like I have anything to gain from pvp except misery, but I like some of the other changes in Survival. The choice is often show this passing by intruder my base or die, and if I have turrets, I die.
---
I do the same thing!  I take photomode pix of my character behind them as well.
---
99% of the time they don't notice.
---
I upped some of the settings on NV to make nights a bit more visible, don't think I had to do that on FO4, but I just stood for 30 seconds trying to rid some rad and regen some health (perk cards) and when I finally realized nothing was moving, saw that it was 3am. I was outside. Just not right.
---
Yeah I had a grenade launcher but that was mostly ineffective as I was atop a cliff. I had to actually run back to the train station to get my other level 30 rifle because my first one almost broke.
---
Or maybe bethesda can bless us with server chat
---
Yeah. For melee, I really need those extra 3 str and agi spots. So I ended up trying to collect unyielding with FDC.
---
Stealth is powerful. My character is high stealth and high powered melee. Agility, Luck and Strength with good armor. I‚Äôm at 27 strength after some whiskey, or go through Whitesprings and never move out of caution.
---
I had one god roll at Harper's Ferry, but it was a marked 3 star mutie. The only god roll I've gotten. I've noticed this problem with unmarked legendaries much more at WS than Harper's. Every charred ghoul last time I was there was diseased, and every one of them had a 1 star legendary drop. Nothing good but hey. I need the caps.
---
The god roll, by the way, was a Vampire, Explosive, Weightless Gatling Gun. Needless to say, I no longer really need Stims.
---
I think they're still bugged in FO4. The buttons never appear where they're supposed to on the larger one.
---
I was thinking the sniper rifle...instigating explosive.   In reading past posts here I see that for a no hand melee you need mutations that counter rifle accuracy.   Maybe no hand melee and vats sniper are incompatible?   So maybe one or two handled melee and stealth sniper?   I‚Äôm at level 21 now and am loading up on action boy and rifle perks.
---
If you‚Äôd like to make your turrets more or less aggressive place garage doors in front of them and use a terminal to open or close em all together open em when you leave but close em when your bringing a friend over
---
Yeah it was a pain for me to find too. I tried server hopping and fast travelling between the three spots that are all close to each other on each server and after ten hops I was like "OK no camera for me I guess".  So I figured as a last ditch I'd just fast travel between all the known locations on one server and that's how I finally found one. I found the guy at the teapot laying on the picnic table.
---
Thats a good idea. Thank you.
---
dang that's unfortunate
---
Lol! Thats too good. Your character looks like he‚Äôs doing an air guitar pose in mid air.
---
I went through about 200 rounds 5.56 and .308 and did like no damage. The guns I had were a 2 shot handmade and a 2 shot mg42 his health just like didn't move took a good 20-30 mins
---
lol as soon as I saw the description I knew which one it was. Good old Gary.
---
T-51 us actually better than ultracite in both is repair cost/durability and defense. While the game states ultracite is better, through tests T-51b has been confirmed superior to all other armors.
---
Max covert, max stealth, max adrenaline, bloody mess, the slugger perks and max action boy with better criticals. I wouldn‚Äôt do explosive. It‚Äôs fun but unstealthy by nature. The Fixer is actually my go to for day to day stealth
---
ALL. THE. TIME.
---
Yeah mine was just a brotherhood recon rifle and a modded hunting rifle. Went through maybe 400 308 ammo.
---
Shadowed armor helps as well.
---
They‚Äôre all good ideas but originally power armor was a prewar military weapon.
---
Bump, No replies yet :(
---
Cool pre-existing structures like bunk cars, bunkers, and that awesome monorail tower.
---
Yes we really do need actual night in this game. As it is now, it's basically perpetual day. It never feels like time actually passes in the game, outside of seeing shadows move.
---
Ive got 3 open tickets that have had no responses for 2 months. This either isn't the place or they don't care.
---
I recommend checking out the filthy causal fallout 76 subreddit as well.
---
I run my Fixer Powerful Automatic silenced so it‚Äôs commando maxed in perception for me. Just seems to be quicker and only takes two shots on most enemies
---
I'd rather they fix the damage on it (and all powered melee weapons) first, hopefully keeping in mind it's high weight compared to the others.
---
Yes I do know of the &gt; 100% repair bumping up the damage, but that degrades too quick and then suddenly you feel like you're waving a feather duster in the enemies face.
---
If it was fixed then I'd definitely consider getting atom shop skins for it.
---
I got shit loot from it. It was fun but overall not worth it. An assassins boxing glove isn't the best thing I could of gotten
---
Yea, I too would love the servers to be unstable as Satan's asshole with diarrhea.
---
Long barrels weigh less than shorter also.
---
I got my first bit of alright legendry gear, camo marine leg armor, can't use it atm but thats ok. Only annoying thing is I had planned on doing a few quests but only had 40 min to play so I got nothing I wanted done .
---
That would be nice, but in the meantime we gotta make do with what we‚Äôve got, y‚Äôknow?
---
Mine is in the mire, which to me is the most beautiful and interesting zone.  Very few random travelers as well. 
---
 Its situated on a cliff and the way the light hits it as the day goes on is really nice.  There's a mirelurk queen who lives in the lagoon below, who we've taken to calling Shelly. She normally behaves herself but sometimes will improve the view in the billiard room by removing an outside wall.
---
Go play ark pvp. You aint seen NOTHING!! 
---
Pvp mechanics in fo76 aint even comparable. My time in ark hardened me.. made me dark.. cold blooded.. and gave me trust issues like my mom did!
---
You need to stand directly on it when you see people inside of site Charlie. Like directly on top. Its a cool easter egg :)
---
Tell me about it!  Im scared to put any weapon into my 5 slot now haha
---
Those are fairly hot.
---
Good idea
---
Fucking comcast turned off my internet at 10am Sunday morning and didn't get it back on till 3am monday morning, which is the time the bonus stopped.  (I am PDT).
---
So can I have another day of bonus xp please?   =)
---
How much?
---
I did about a dozen server hops at Willard's and several more at Phillipi before giving up that night. When I logged on the next day, there it was. 
---
Now to do it 3 more times.
---
I never get anything done granted to actually do the story quest I need 8 ppl to launch the nuke and my friends just dont own the game so I'll probably never get anything done. So spending like half an hour wasnt a waste of time but I could have been doing better things
---
Im going to assume this is over but just in case ps4, probably the war or black rider power armor skins.
---
I haven‚Äôt followed them too closely.  But I would bet 10+ if max level but 2*.
---
Yeah I just dont get much time to play most days. Its all good might get time tonight.
---
When you do the math it adds up fast. 118 base damage at 250% around 260 damage in an automatic.  Plus you add in 60% for adrenaline. Then your critical hits stack in there somehow as well. 
---
I don‚Äôt know how it stacks in but the damage is high and that‚Äôs without a legendary weapon that adds power to your shots ( although fixer seems to be more powerful than other rifles )
---
118 base is with the drink Ballistic Bock also.
---
Whatever your turrets kill - you can loot. You'll only get XP if you tag it.
---
Please make the change optional, due to vision issues, I either need high light or high contrast to see what is on the screen.
---
I don't mind the crappy damage but your right it is kinda low
---
Sorry you got onions
---
Oh my bad I didn‚Äôt see
---
I've noticed all armor is taking more damage from everything since the last patch!
---
I also don't enjoy challenges that requires server hopping.  I found out yesterday the challenge that requires me taking a picture of a mutant hound and a behemoth doesn't work if I take two separate pictures from different locations with guaranteed behemoth spawns.  That leads to me assuming this challenge can only be completed with random events. It could easily take me over an hour of walking to random event points in cranberry bog and server hopping just to get a behemoth spawn.
---
Just lost my bloodied handmade, i couldn't of sold or drop it cause i had it as my favorite and it would of told me something... RIP that weapon
---
If you're on XB1, I got a 2 shot M79
---
&gt;What's the point of being a friendly PVP player if we all get treated the same as actual assholes?
---
Well it doesn't cost you anything. And surely you are not always treated the same?
---
&gt;They told me they all filed (false) reports against me convinced I was a leet hacker. 
---
That's your judgement. But you don't get to deside if it was false or not. They are not supposed to know if you are cheating or not.
---
Ok thx
---
What console? I have quite a bit extra if you're on xbox
---
If we're talking comfort and support, 6, 7, 18, and 19 look very realistic for long treks. I like their subtle details; pockets and internal frames. Ill probably use 7 the most.
---
When I do the imposter sheepsquatch event, I activate a pylon and then stand next to one of the other pylons and use the come here emote until someone comes over. The other day I ended up activating all three pylons myself and I STILL helped with the fight.
---
It is annoying however when you spend ~1900 caps and the impostor sheepsquatch's corpse is invisible and flies off somewhere I can't find it. Turns out the camera helps find the corpse as its name appears in the viewfinder when the camera is pointed at it.
---
I still keep a dozen stimpaks on hand at minimum because of auto-stim armor and the right d-pad hotkey (PC controller player). All other usage has been moved over to nukas though. I sell all my rad-x and radaway and have replaced them with grape and orange (I do still use radshield though).
---
Does healing factor reduce overdrives dmg buff?
---
How did you find this out?
---
Were is the tourist at Beckley I need a picture
---
Mole miners and deathclaws drop it.
---
No. I think there's something there you  need. Otherwise any place with a tinker workbench would light up.
---
I‚Äôm actually on Xbox myself
---
Thank you for the kind words sir .
---
I am so jealous I NEED
---
Kill some mole miners. Also I think the workshop near Morgantown has a resource node (though I could be mis-remembering).
---
I was literally suggesting Bethesda look into it. Good for you- you didnt get suspended for something you didnt do. That doesnt mean some of us others didn‚Äôt. I dont know why reddit is so persistent in claiming everyone that got banned is a cheater.
---
Oh gawd sorry for your lost.
---
They're not farming XP, they're exploiting the game to farm legendary items. Only way for a low level play [who can't even equip power armor pieces or use weapons with high mag capacity] to survive the is by letting the turrets do all the work...
---
I got a picture and video of a SBQ and sheep boy the other day it was great! Need to upload it to my PS4 account yet.
---
Best believe I'll grind that event until I get my jester mask T.T
---
Im pretty inexperienced at reddit. All I know is people on here are so sure that everyone that got suspended was banned rightfully. I know how my post looks, and I really dont need confirmation from anyone because Im the only one (aside from my friend) that knows I didnt cheat.
---
I posted it pretty much wondering if Bethesda would ever actually look into the fact that they made a mistake.
---
I do that in my swimsuit. Give them a thumbs up and just move along.
---
Fight a bunch of deathclaws. They usually have a few bits of it on them
---
I just hit level 50 today. Good stuff.
---
I couldn't get it to work till I climbed down into the broken part of the top floor on the side facing the asylum. Then I turn around and some guy was just about to try to melee stagger me off the building, lol.
---
Not hard at all. I found him at the giant teapot literally my first time trying to find him. With two different characters. I was honestly starting to think it was a static spawn until i started seeing people lose their shit over not being able to find him.
---
Complete nonsense, T51 has the highest damage and energy resist in the game but has an average rad resistance. So if you want a PA to use outside of nuke zones t51 is best if you want the best for nuke zones x01 has the best overall stats
---
He‚Äôs absolutely adorable if u can get him to stay inside he might be relatively safe!
---
As for mine I think he‚Äôs already dead üòë
---
Yeah, how frustrating was that? How much XP did you manage to get from that?
---
I realize that from everyone elses point of view I mist 100% be a cheater because Bethesda said so. And from Bethesdas pov Im one person, so they dont care if my issue gets resolved. But from my pov I waited from announcement to time of release after preordering the game- then put in enough time to get to level 100- something. Then I get banned after being an avid hater of everyone that cheats... for cheating that I really didnt do. 
---
My point is Bethesda owes it to the ones that didnt dupe to at least check into it.
---
OP is asking about a low level quest and people say "Go fight a Deathclaw" lol.
---
Most of us people who live in cities are used to street lights, and night time being made to look bright on TV. A space alien watching earth tv would probably think "wow, so do they have like, a second dimmer star, or like multiple giant moons?". In reality its the fact that film and modern camera sensors need light so as not look grainy and fuzzy. They blast the sets out with light sometimes, so that you can see whats happening. Google images of your favorite sitcom, then step outside at night... did I blow your mind? (doubtful, you guys/gals are smart).
---
TLDR: Most people don't go out into the wilderness at night very often, are lazy, and complain when they can't see shit. IRL night time is dark, but that's completely counter to most urban humans LED streetlight and tv sitcom experiences...so people complain.
---
364 days until the next Pretzel day - Stanley Hudson
---
Yes, do this and when you get real close just whisper in their ear "hey".
---
I didnt throw my buddy under the bus because he didnt cheat. Think about how you‚Äôd feel if you were suspended from your favorite game for a mistake. The least you would do is ask for Bethesda to review your case. I emailed a ticket and they replied saying my account how too many items. If I ever get unsuspended I‚Äôll start recording as soon as I get on to prove solely to you that my carry weight was never abnormally high.
---
Thanks for the information, this is really eye opening. If I may, what SPECIAL spread would you suggest for an automatic rifle build? And are there any perks you consider a must have?
---
Ah I dont remember, but I guess it would make sense then
---
If it wasn't perceived as being overpowered, which it isn't, no one would play it because of how boring and repetitive it is.
---
1. Gorge Junkyard workshop (west of Morgantown) has a black titanium extractor. You might get murdered by players with ebay gear though.
---
2. You can instead kill mole miners and take their "Mole Miner Scrap". They're a common spawn in the Ash Heap, usually with a good concentration in Welch. Blackwater Mine (just west of Whitesprings) will always have a bunch, and Uranium Fever will add a lot more.
---
3. Deathclaws normally drop around 5 black titanium each. I don't know the spawns that well, but there's one on Deathclaw island and another at the substation just north of Watoga. 
---
4. Higher level players don't have much use for black titanium, so they'll often sell or donate it if you ask.
---
0.. the camp was massive and was like 3 stories.  It hovered over the club and the turrets would shoot through the windows.
---
Mad ground baby is mad.
---
You should know that in fo76 unlike fo4 when you tag something then swap from your recon weapon or peaely peaper the marker goes away
---
I ran into a lucky server last night doing Westtek. Between the muties outside and inside 11 or 12 were Legendary and 3 were 3 star Legendary, 1 outside and 2 inside. Of course the loot was hot garbage though.
---
I believe there would be a random drop for legendary Shepard‚Äôs crooks just as with other weapons. It‚Äôs just that it‚Äôs been released recently and it would take some time to find one.
---
Mole miners are by far the quickest, safest way to get black tit.
---
I‚Äôve emailed them twice and got the same response everyone else did. I get how everyone that cheated deserves to be ripped on this community but you gotta understand there‚Äôs a possibility some of us really didn‚Äôt dupe- bc I didnt. I know how cliche it sounds but Im just looking for anyone else that can relate- or others that agree with individually looking into accounts.
---
Im all for perma-banning everyone that actually cheated.
---
Just like when gunsmith and makeshift warrior stop working, and my gun/gauntlet breaks in an hour!
---
thats just the flatwoods monster (which is totally an alien)
---
That is actually extremely useful to know.  Does the same apply to the "Pearly Peepers?"
---
 Try getting an endangerol syringer.  It's basically like giving everyone in the fight a psycho.
---
Even if not a chat, some way yo join an event and ask the server to help you if you choose. Like a set broadcast message.
---
Yes unfortunately, if you use anything to mark theb swap weapons markers disappear
---
Yeah, but power armor was used by businesses for advertising and profitability. The Nuka-Quantum armor was shown off in Nuke World, the Vim Paint was made for power armor and advertising, and excavator armor was designed to increase mining efficiency.
---
Here's a link to a thread with stats for each power armor:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive\_power\_armor\_and\_mods\_guide/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b7oyri/comprehensive_power_armor_and_mods_guide/) 
---
For just the stats: 
---
* Ultracite:  **DR** 454 **ER** 395 **RR** 395 
---
* T-51b:  **DR** 455 **ER** 455 **RR** 310 
---
When you factor in that the T-51b is cheaper to repair and easier to modify, I think it's a clear winner between the two.
---
This only counts toward the base weapon weight, not any attached mods!
---
Any old broken pro snap won‚Äôt do. You have to find the tourist. You have to have he bucket list to start the quest.
---
I think it would be nice if the devs would realize that not everyone has more time to play on the weekend. This goes for all companies. Everyone does weekend events, but I have WAY more time to play during the week than weekend. I only got like 6 hours of play time during double xp. We need event weeks, not weekends.
---
I usually ask myself if it's a good building location for a real house or cabin. If it's infested with super mutants then that's a solid no.
---
That explains so much. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Is that a frog in the second pic's explosion?
---
Weren't the C, D, E, etc. Just boosts for only defensive capabilities? I get that that's interesting and logical from a story aspect, but why wouldn't I just use maxed out Ultracite or XO-1instesd of maxed out T-51E?
---
Now pretzel day.... that's a good day
---
I like onions.  They have layers.
---
It CAN'T be modified, it's a prebuilt gun that can only be increased or decreased in level, as long as you still own it!
---
Excavator is the newest iteration, Nuka quantum is lore breaking since the enclave invented the xo-1 after the bombs fell. Nuka world and Vim are still using a suit of T-51B which is a military suit that they acquired/bought. The excavator originally has no combat functions since it‚Äôs meant for mining. It‚Äôs defense is just because of its construction and mining based purposes, not as a suit to be used in the battlefield
---
I think a good way is using the u-mine-it machines.
---
Sentinel is a good even on a level 1 armor...
---
A piece of sentinel level 1 wood armor is better than a heavy level 50 combat armor dude
---
Ditto!
---
Nope.
---
I encountered one of these once, literally punching my camp to death. They were wearing a devil mask and everything.
---
I server hopped, problem solved. If they follow you via recent players, block them and server hop again.
---
Well damn, what good are they then? Bummer. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Plumb crazy
---
Are they wrong about the place then? I've checked about 8 places so far with no luck.. but I'm not even sure if I'm coming back to the game, I'm just passively interested at this point.
---
Spec into melee to begin with, the easiest early game damage buffs are strength boosting melee weapons, when you start getting lots of ammo and a decent gun, then spec into it I'd you want!
---
I am in the enclave
---
Delayed &gt; Broken
---
(Thats a greater than symbol, not an arrow.)
---
At the very end when I finally destroyed the assaultron and the gutsys, there is a terminal that you access in order to leave the end area. The terminal opens the door that shortcuts u back around to the exit of the burrows. There was a holotape inside the terminal (which is not a usual thing) below the 'open door' option.
---
There is a daily atom sets - where theres always something like collect 5 wood. So basically, this is already here.
---
I have this issue, particularly with the super sledge. The enemy can be standing right in front of me, but the game doesn't seem to connect my attacks with it. It feels like the range of some melee weapons is insanely small or bugs out sometimes.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqHwm6ttRfs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqHwm6ttRfs)
---
This bot is standing right in front of me, yet my attacks don't connect. In game, that's about two steps away maybe. That should be more than enough range to hit it with a giant sledgehammer, and yet I miss. This is part of the reason I gave up on melee builds. I felt like I'd miss half the attacks on stuff that's *right in front of me*. There should be no way I'd miss, but I would.
---
It's hidden
---
You can play a few combos, but Agility, luck, and perception must be 15.
---
I‚Äôd consider perks like concentrated fire and Grim reaper sprint Must haves, along with sneaking things.
---
That's why the most defensive suit would be located at The Whitespring and why the Racer suit would have low armor ratings. The one designed by high ranking officials could be used as a real suit in case of emergency, and the Racee suit is mostly just for show. 
---
The repulsor arm would be the most lore-unfriendly idea here, but considering how cutting edge of a city Watoga was, I dont see it as unlikely that there were soldiers positioned around the area.
---
Good luck. I'm in the same boat. That mission was over before I knew it, and I didn't catch the name of the holotape either. I don't know why it stopped playing.
---
Go see Rose at the top of the world. She‚Äôs got shit for you to do
---
Console? Just mute the tv?
---
Gunsmith and makeshift warrior sometimes stops working and requires you to toggle them!
---
where at?
---
Which would be fair if you got steel from it, too. But the ratios should be slightly higher from 10lb to 25.
---
I may or may not have been followed by you on my way to the Mothman Museum lol
---
Yes, balance changes. Making legendaries harder to get is a balance change.
---
That was a fun trip, I made it just before the game came out, I want to go back and visit grafton and flatwoods ect...
---
Food and flux still decays faster!
---
No, I was talking about how I appreciated big robots in other games, such as Titanfall. I dont believe that the armors should offer negative benefits. The unique effects should be minor, but just enough to make players question which suits to use. People use excavator armor for more carry weight, and Ultracite or XO1 for armor. I want to create a more diverse system with more questions. 
---
Choosing between optimizing movability, carry weight, survivability, or resistance should be a decent and difficult decision to make.
---
I totally understand where you‚Äôre coming from, but I think to his point. If you don‚Äôt want to shell out. Don‚Äôt show up and sit back. 
---
It‚Äôs almost like going to the SBQ and staying in the shed. I run shotgun and heavy gunner so totally understand the amount of ammo needed, but I never once thought of riding others coattails.
---
They already stated private servers were fine when they were pushing this game before they even released it. It isn't illegal to just make a mod to let you join the private servers were making. Nothing illegal about it.
---
Im sad i didnt get all the decorations mostly the baloons and bunting which would be awesome for july.
---
Blackwater Mine has an obscene amount of Mole Miners
---
You can kill them easily with shotgun builds from level 30, or maybe rifle + marsupial. Otherwise probably best to stay away.
---
Flair gun has cheap ammo
---
Oh and airens
---
Koolaid man: OOOHHH YEEAAAH!
---
wait what are we doing again
---
Where's your chainsaw, Ash?
---
They weight 3lbs per one core. Just saying.
---
I'd suggest waiting, but it's kinda up to you.
---
I think what makes 76 special is exactly what Bethesda was trying for: Making other *people* special*.*
---
When playing, you spend a lot of time like any other Fallout game if you're a solo player. Shoot the thing, do the quest, grab the loot. But every once in a while, you'll see something move, and you'll look, and it's not just an NPC or monster, but another *person*, an individual human doing their own little thing in the world space you share. And you can wave, and they'll usually stop and wave back, just another happy wastelander passing by. Many will chit chat if you say hello on the mic. It actually makes the game feel far more alive, in a way mere NPC's cannot match.
---
An amazing number of camps are unlocked and unguarded, even welcoming in their designs. So many have food and water available to any who need it, and all too often, approaching a home with someone inside results in cheerful waves or chat instead of gunfire or even silence. For every drab practical house, I find a bar, or a hotel, or... \*cough\* a murder maze, but it's all in good fun. People create camps for themselves, but they also often create camps for others to find as well.
---
People share in this game. I've dropped silly amounts of ammo and food and chems for players, and had some have dropped for me in return when I am on a low level. It's not uncommon to wander through Whitesprings or Watoga or Flatwoods and find little goodies stashed in world containers, nice fully modded low level weapons or ammo or plans. It's almost normal to find spare plans in the Flatwoods overseer box or the Whitesprings cash registers. And most of the time, you never know who the anonymous benefactor is, or why they did it, but you know someone thought about the other players enough to leave a surprise for them.
---
Fallout 76 is not a well polished game, or a well designed game, or a well planned game. It's certainly not a well launched game. But it is a great game all the same, because it does exactly what it is supposed to do. It makes people special.
---
And as far as I have seen, every last one of us still loves Country Roads.
---
Happens to me with heavy guns if they are too close. Almost like they are closer than the end of the gun or closer than the end of your melee weapon. I just back up if possible.
---
What do players have that can deal poison damage? One of the syringer barrels maybe?
---
Seriously?
---
Their private servers, something discussed to be late this year. "Reverse engineering" their servers is obviously theft, and you would be sued into Oblivion.
---
This isn't rocket science, a "mod" on their servers isn't going to bother them. If you're connecting to any servers that aren't theirs, before they implement private servers.. you stole them.
---
It really doesn't matter what you reply with at this point, this is their game, not yours. They've earned the rights to whatever fucked up experience it is we get when we play their game.
---
Really? "Fuck, if the rabbit didn't want to die..." does not imply sarcasm? Well, fuck me, I'm a real dumbass. Thanks for correcting me.
---
(In case you missed it... that's sarcasm.)
---
(... And so was that.)
---
(Let's just assume the sarcastic comments on sarcasm carry on from here, shall we?)
---
Heh heh the other night I was in survival mode and had snuck up on these two player that were at the ammunition factory. I made it all the way up to the wall in the back and was hiding, wanted to inch my way around the wall to get inside and find them to melee sneak attack. 
---
I got stuck on something (it was pretty dark back there and I didn't want to turn my light on), couldn't move. I'd just spent a half hour sneaking up on those people and I was now stuck to their damn wall. I was trying to free myself (couldn't fast travel either) and they heard me. Killed me. I got on the mic and said "Thank you! I was stuck!"
---
Then I hear the guy say "Shit! Now ***I'm*** stuck! " (I guess when he went to take my loot bag he got stuck, it was pretty funny)
---
Random Shopkeeper: MY CABBAGES!
---
Why avoid people with sentry bot helmets?
---
Agreed, they are both terribly, terribly annoying.
---
I saw a post where data mined info showed that all the mods for the crook, staff, and club can only be earned as plans dropped from the Free Range event. But I guess time will tell.
---
I think he means the exploit where you can toggle the card when it caps out, and the damage buff will keep raising as long as you keep toggling the card! Not tested this recently though.
---
The new poisoned sheepsquatch staff
---
Which is more durable? I ask because I switched from T60 to Ultracite and my subjective opinion is that Ultracite is way more durable. Even if it's a PITA to mod and has not paint available outside of Atomic Shop, durability is a factor.
---
And before you ask I used the same perk cards to repair both. It's hard to be sure, but I don't think I was subjecting the T60 to anymore use and damage than the UC.
---
No witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game and do not accuse players of cheating. Use Bethesda's official support page to report them [here](https://help.bethesda.net/). Do not name in shame in general.
---
Yeah and much of the time we get two of the damn sheepsquatchs at the same time
---
Someone needs to lore the Sheepsquatch into a fight with the Sheepsqautch Imposter. I had one spawn outside of Mountblair Trainyard, so it's nit that far of a pull.
---
Can you point me to what subs are for selling please?
---
Consider checking /r/fo76marketplace for a reasonable price check under current market standards. Avoid /r/fo76bazaar, it's gotten a bad rep for a reason. Good luck.
---
I do the same thing and have been grinding the event for days. My biggest gripe with it is people rushing to the sheepsquatch without defending the Brahmin by the barn. Things go great for a while then we fail in a few seconds.
---
Agreed. I used a darker night mod in FO4 and it made the game so much funner. It's like daytime during the nights on 76.
---
Negative, they never once stated "their private servers", that is literally you making up something they didn't say.
---
&gt; "Reverse engineering" their servers is obviously theft, and you would be sued into Oblivion.
---
Nope, it is no different than making any other mod that requires you to sniff memory. That is also "reverse engineering" that isn't illegal.
---
&gt;This isn't rocket science, a "mod" on their servers isn't going to bother them. If you're connecting to any servers that aren't theirs, before they implement private servers.. you stole them.
---
Once again, that isn't true, they never said that they were going to make private servers. Just that private servers were okay.
---
&gt;It really doesn't matter what you reply with at this point, this is their game, not yours. They've earned the rights to whatever fucked up experience it is we get when we play their game.
---
Wrong, you do have rights when you purchase a game, EULA's can't take away your rights. That has been decided years ago by SCOTUS. So no, we have every right to do what we want with the program we purchased.
---
Still full price in the UK!
---
I‚Äôm fairly certain they can be crafted or gotten again from the machine in the mansion.  I could be wrong though
---
This. Whenever I am bored, I chug me some nukashine and wait till I land in a random place, then try to get home without looking at my map. It's like playing the google earth game, but more supermutants.
---
Yeah I missed ALL of the double xp weekend cause of work. Disappointed.
---
I didnt name and shame and there is 100% proof the guy is a cheater, get off your high horse, guy should be banned already. Blame me for caring. Reddit is garbage anyway
---
I wish they would do untradeable tokens you can activate for a day of double xp
---
You're creepy as f@#k but as long as it's fun, carry on.
---
From what I have seen, stuff that leaves will probably cycle back eventually, we've had a couple things return already if I remember correctly. The short sales are just there to encourage atom purchases.
---
Okay. I hope you have the money and legal team to see this through. Theft is theft. Let me know when it goes live, so I have popcorn ready.
---
Damn right, same here.
---
ALL Enemy's in survival are hostile all the time.
---
you cant choose to be pacifist in survival as pacifist is turned off for Survival.
---
Unfortunately not. It can only be upgrated, but not recreated
---
Oh, I do, don't worry about that, not to mention the EFF would probably get involved pro bono, because it is literally legal under federal laws.
---
Check the link I shared above.
---
Well, being a dick is very profitable in this game.
---
I can understand why people sit in the shed, because it minimizes expenses and maximizes reward.
---
It‚Äôs scummy, but people who understand the mechanics will always exploit them in any game, and in real life as well.
---
I hate shed hiders as much as anyone else, but posts like this won‚Äôt stop them. 
---
Maybe something like a reimbursement on bullets if you succeed would make it more worthwhile.
---
Inside joke.
---
You're correct.
---
When you had the stimpacks...man I totally hear you on that. I remember before the Imposter Sheepsquatch event was a thing I had like 200 stimpacks and now I'm down to like 30. That event did me a huge favor in getting rid of all those stims, now I can travel light but I can't be a pylon anymore
---
I've been capped out for a few months. I dont play much, but it's very annoying that we even have a cap limit. Let the economy regulate itself at this point. Duping was the only reason I could see having a cap limit at the time. 
---
I've found on pc since caps are capped, most everything just wants to trade at this point, and they are only useful for picking up ammo and a few other things. I use to enjoy making my rounds killing everything and selling it to the npc vendors, but I haven't been able to do that in awhile. The only other way around it right now is more characters, which I have no desire to do.
---
Guess what they did it hehe
---
Titanium and black titanium are the same thing, just mislabeled in game. The Junkyard near Morgantown has a titanium node, and you can find them in the wild. Otherwise, as others have said, Mole Miners are a great resource for it.
---
Considered long term, it was well worth the full price (I've gotten more than 100 hours of gameplay out of it, and I consider anything less than $1/hr to be worth the effort). It's definetly a game where you eventually grow bored, walk away, and come back a week or so later to see what's new and maybe shoot some super mutants for fun.
---
Who won?
---
Real answer, they couldn't figure out how to explode the legendary robots correctly (Not  instantaneously and not randomly for 1s to 20s), so they just said fuck it and removed them. It's ok Bethesda you don't have to admit it, but we know the truth.
---
Not our rule. It's reddit's. You show his name in the videos and this isn't the proper place to report. Bethesda does bans in waves, not on a case-by-case basis. Report the player, and move on.
---
Preach!  But honestly I don‚Äôt need the bullets, but I‚Äôm pretty casual and enjoy the grind.
---
What did this have to do with the original post. No one asked for this here bro it‚Äôs totally irrelevant
---
[Edit] Like for you're mineral deposit in you're camp or workshops
---
Fight me
---
https://youtu.be/hqe3MRb3StY
---
I was saying "it is a terrible PVP mechanic." PVP is something that engages two or more individuals to fight it out over something. This does not.
---
This lures in a PVEr who wants a resource farm for whatever reason (barbie wasteland dream house, bullets for the SB Queen, etc) while he or she goes out to do other PVE stuff. At the same time, it lets the PVPer (who for some reason won't play on the PVP server, I assume suckage is a factor) know where they can pop in and either gank the player and/or wreck the resource farm. End result being the PVP player kills the PVE player, who leaves for another server. It's not fulfilling for anybody who actually wants to PVP. It's not fulfilling for anybody trying to collect resources for PVE. 
---
Ultimately the PVErs don't use the workshops, and the PVPers in Adventureland don't have any easy mode PVP kills.
---
Seriously, this is more or less my typical resource gathering build. [I assure you anytime you whack somebody who'd building up a workshop, it's something very similar.](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=bf43b75&amp;d=sa2sv3sb1s01p72p10ln0p90p80pa0pd2p62p00e82e60c52ic4i61s12ik0l71lm2ag2au2&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=)
---
PVPing somebody with that build isn't a challenge, it's like kicking a puppy with steel toed boots.
---
The stock (I assume troll) response is that they are justified in playing that way since that's how it's designed. Grow up and stop licking the frozen flag pole. It's that sort of idiocy that has resulted in idiot warning stickers on products across America.
---
man, when you pointed out the "washed out" effect, you had me.
---
I missed the Sausage, Flag Pole, and the Effigy, and it eats at me every day.
---
What system are you on?
---
Still waiting for a reason to come back to 76
---
Ok... what‚Äôs the tourist?
---
I was looking for an objective in the swamp. it must have been obvious I was searching for something and checking the map alot, it was dark as F in the swamp. then a creepy voice out of nowhere "can you find it?" "I dont know creepy voice in the dark!" no idea how long he was with me.
---
I would like for there to be NPC's so I can murder them does that make me creepy
---
Gimli:
---
AND MY AXE!
---
Did the same thing, was my first pic I took. Good looking my dude.
---
r/unexpectedoffice
---
What platform? I have a bunch I'll give ya.
---
Get on the ground baby! Our lord and savior needs more souls
---
Craigslist's missed connections is the next street down.
---
Current from the one we already have?
---
Yeah I spawned in at white springs bc I forgot I was there losing 300 quantum‚Äôs is still insane tho
---
Do raider enemies even exist in the game? All the ones I‚Äôve seen so far have been corpses
---
I think you need better fucking friends. Your selection process gives me the heebie-jeebies.
---
PS4.
---
The real lord is the ground. Men are but instruments of the divine will of the ground
---
Question when you say -1 armor for 1 damage do you mean for every 1 damage the poison does it reduces 1 armor for the amount the poison dealt for that amount of time?
---
2months later i will sell all plans.
---
5k caps each :D
---
The excuse of "I was using it as it was designed" is the reason there is a sticker on my toaster that warns "do not insert fingers into slots when toaster is plugged in."
---
Would you like some toast?
---
Nope. It makes you boring.
---
Figured this was the best way to reach him, he hasn‚Äôt been online in a while
---
Yeah definitely, I work Fri/Sat/Sun so I miss most of the double xp.
---
From the promo images, I assume the vendor is a moleman. I am also guessing the closed off hole is his tunnel.
---
Yeah, my kids all play sports so weekends are just baseball, lacrosse, lacrosse, baseball, soccer, boy scouts, laundry, then getting ready for the week to start over. Def no time for my silly shit.
---
You all sound like a bunch of ground babies whining and crying because you get killed in a video game.
---
Sacrificial blade Machete I think.
---
Definitely wish you luck; some of my launch group has totally fallen off the face of the earth and it's disappointing.
---
I am guessing that they don't actually care about that level of firearm accuracy, what with the limp wrist 50 cal ammo and whatnot.
---
Hilariously I made a PSA a few days ago about that exact same issue.
---
I'll server hop for a bit to see if I can find a tourist
---
I'm on PC and can make it, and calibrated shocks but I don't think I have the stable violet flux for that.
---
I got one for you but I‚Äôm about to clock in u til around 10 am tomorrow. Currently 1133 pm.
---
Congrats!!
---
Wow after all that I just got it at the Teapot. Thanks for the help. That amazing that as soon as I give in and post it happens lol.
---
Try to find someone selling it on marketplace? :)
---
Heylilmommaletmewhisperinyaear..
---
10 hours loop plz and ty
---
Glad you found one!
---
The Creation Engine is old and not very efficient.
---
Also, some lead gets lost in the data stream.
---
No just a idea until they add in cool lights and shop signs
---
I saw that, and it stuck with me ever since. I now always stand by the Brahmin at the end and emote for people to come over there. Works like half the time
---
I miss mama deathclaw from FO4 when I brought her egg back to her nest. We bonded.
---
Your shop was awesome. I had a great time there. If you‚Äôre open shoot me a PM and if I‚Äôm on I‚Äôll come on by!
---
I've been using it for quite a while without issues (PC)
---
Ah ya know I probably didn‚Äôt realize it wasn‚Äôt sarcasm because it wasn‚Äôt funny at all, if you wanted it to be funny you would‚Äôve named two relevant armor legendary perks, not some random shit you can never get together. You suck at sarcasm is what I‚Äôm saying.
---
Well you can wait for bethesda to fix it. OR you can build you're own camp there rocketless. 
---
if you jump in the air and place the C.A.M.P. high in a tree you can make the structure tall enough to do crafting at the top without drawing aggro. 
---
this will let you have a near place to wp to when you are nuking it. 
---
you can make it out of nothing but stairs and floors with just a platform and benches on top. then store the benches prior to nuke. the floors and ladder are indestructable. 
---
just a thought. then no one could camp there and you could have a place to repair and stuff.
---
I like to do this with low level players and act as their guardian angel ghost when they get in over their head
---
T51b - best balistic rezistance, weak rad rezist
---
X-01 - best energy rezistance
---
Ultracite - best balistic rezistance
---
Ultracite is stronger than t51b, but it is hard for people to get plans. I killed SBQ 100+ times and still dont have most of plans. And ultracite jetpack don't exist.
---
I got this plan, I don't see it available to make though...
---
What if they release completely different masks and the old ones go the way of runescape party hats? :)
---
I see what you did there.
---
You gotta keep at least one Berry Mentats on you for just that sort of thing!
---
I just noticed the Cryolator breaks the lore for no reason
---
Its not an exploit when you have to pay for the aluminum and steel to do it
---
Personally, I think they went about it all wrong. Rather than adding in pvp full stop, then trying to make a bunch of different systems to prevent griefing/unwanted pvp (which just ended up being exploitable and led to even *more* griefing), they should have more structured ways to engage in pvp.
---
Like, if there was a faction system, and you could choose to be a ‚Äúraider‚Äù for that day. Instead of going around shooting random people for no reason, you‚Äôd get radiant quests that would pit you against other players doing ‚Äúgood‚Äù faction radiant quests. And the people who don‚Äôt want to pvp at all could just remain in the ‚Äúvault‚Äù faction, which would work just like it does now. But I‚Äôm just spit balling.
---
In other words, they should get rid of griefing by simply making it impossible, and then add actual fun ways to pvp that people actually really want to engage in, so nobody needs to grief.
---
Use the effigy as a scarecrow, beret and masks ready, Swiss flags flying in my tower of power. All set
---
Batteries Included FTW
---
I think it will come back, because moneys are moneys, but to be fair, it shouln't. Skins like this or blackbird are for people who played long ago. For masters of this game, no-lifers :D
---
I get you issue, but having a vender would just remove a big part of nukes.
---
It's not the numerical club I'd most aspire to, but congrats anyway! ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è
---
I think that might be a lag issue? I also have this problem and I feel like it only happens whenever I‚Äôm lagging.
---
Alright I sent a request we‚Äôll meet up whenever we‚Äôre both online
---
Could be you have to make your way thro the dungeon for the first time to get him to unlock.
---
Thx
---
Yea might just work
---
It's free real estate
---
And the song is back in my head....
---
"It just works!"
---
-Todd
---
Went to add said cant bc of your settings
---
I mean, maybe? I stopped playing the game at the end of January, and my only friend that kept on playing made new friends since then..
---
The only part that bothered me is that they didn't stick up for me. I literally had whatever I could want when I stopped playing.. they were proud that they reached my point, they had everything they wanted.. but admitting I had that months ago?
---
Idk. I haven't removed them as a friend yet, but them acting like they can't vouch for me really bothered me.
---
I also don't have the energy to care, I don't miss the drama this game can bring. It's much easier to just walk away until I have a real reason to come back.
---
Shit hold on what's your psn?
---
I love this photo
---
I_jack_is_back
---
+karma
---
Next patch they're going to make it so if you're in Pacifst people can't damage your CAMP.
---
It's the accent that makes this funny.
---
If this was done with a US accent, I don't think it would be as funny.
---
It's not a rumor. I know for a fact. Just tonight I lost 23 plans and 12 mods from my mule. 3 mods being ones I've saved for my X01 to include the jetpack. Prior to this, I lost over a dozen items off my mule over the past couple weeks.
---
Alright should be good I fixed privacy settings. Had them set to no one after that ps4 bricking message crap awhile ago and forgot. My bad
---
Pretty sure it hasn't happened yet.
---
I mean, if you slow walk in your power armor everywhere anyway because you can never find new god damn fusion cores, you can overload your dick with lead weights.
---
I don't have any clue how to dupe either and everything I had was farmed or bought by me. Just no explanation.
---
This isn't new, it's been happening to me for months.
---
That's a strange combo of Leather Jacket and jeans and Campaign Hat.
---
Have you thought of crowdsourcing the map content? When X number of people have reported a resource or item at a site, you include it.  Maybe give a shout-out to the contributirs. I'm sure there are lots of people who'd do it for the ego stroke.
---
Lost a chest piece that was a single piece, no duplicate items, it's just gone. So pissed.
---
You wear one don't you üòâ
---
Thanks dad
---
Yeah I just lost my vampire explosive combat shotty that I was just offered a lot of caps for. And my power armor pieces disappeared off my frame twice last week.
---
I had a friend who played this for a while who pronounced it chay-sis. Getting the plural form wrong is not the worst that can happen with this word.
---
At least you didn't lose legendaries out of your stash box like I did
---
I've been doing that lately.  Along with going around the military camps in the bog
---
No offense dude, your site looked professionally done before this latest update..  
---
And whats with the radiation green? It looks awful.  
---
Please tell me your not going to leave your site like that, then expect people to make donations to a site that looks sooo unprofessional.. Bleeeh...
---
just slightly.
---
October?
---
I haven't had an issue until the camera was released. Aka patch 8.5
---
I wasn't aware an excuse was needed to play the game as intended. The equivalent would be complaining your toaster toasted your bread.
---
I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre working on another event that brings players together like Faschnacht.  Super cool, people meeting up and talking, trading.  Awesome for the community.
---
It's called Marcus' Speech.
---
Honestly, survival servers is where this would seem expected. If that's where I was playing, I would have 0 complaints.
---
Are you being serious? Because that would make sense.. PvP and high stakes in one place, and just play the fucking game in the other.. I honestly regret coming back to the game, that I should have waited until there was something worth coming back for.
---
Beat them with it
---
I was hoping there would be an insignia at least showing the higher rank, kind of like the BOS power armor paint, but nope. Exactly the same. Officer suit is much better. With the protective lining all three can be upgraded to roughly 10/8/4 damage resist.
---
25k cap limit will truly not be enough to purchase one of those if that‚Äôs the case.
---
Oh man you‚Äôre missing out! Yeah you can have all but one at the same time (carnivore and herbivore naturally wouldn‚Äôt work together)
---
Quite honestly this is just a giant post full of misinformation. Damage capped at 190?? Sneak attacks don‚Äôt make a difference? Bloodied isn‚Äôt good? What are you smoking man.
---
I play survival constantly, average at lest 10 kills a life, highest kill streak was 65, weekly best is usually around 20-30 in a life. 
---
And I will tell you again, you‚Äôre just flat out wrong man. You‚Äôre using a bunch of assumptions and not looking at the actual numbers, the effects, what‚Äôs happening when you shoot someone.
---
Me and a buddy routinely spend almost a hour each day testing different weapons and armor in different situations in survival, and I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting the info to come to these conclusions, but I disagree with about everything you said based on my experience and personal testing.
---
I didn't notice it til a couple weeks ago. A guy wanted a magazine I had listed and when I transferred to my mule it wasn't there. I decided then I needed an inventory list and since then, all kinds of items disappear. Bobbleheads, magazines, weapons and armor. Nothing significant yet but tonight I lost every single plan and mod I either bought or found. One included the X01 jetpack mod I was saving until I found the shocks. Tonight really hurt. At 0.25 weight on the plans I had over 100lbs of plans on that mule that I acquired during my 200 levels. It really hurts.
---
Sure it is
---
We have so many in universe ways to fix it, atmospheric ways too. Seeing the light off in the distance following a road was immersive, sure I was spooked being fresh from the vault but I wondered what it was. Give the catseye drug from new vegas as a chem, glow sticks, flares light able torches we can throw to light fuel or enemies ablaze but add immersive atmospheric means. Give night vision, thermal vision options for power armor or goggles. Give attachable flashlights for their own slots on weapons that outshine pipboys. Have tactical lights that make it slightly easier to see but not be seen etc.
---
I'll check it out. I'm at work rn but I'm gonna bet you know what you're talking about. Much oblige, wastelander
---
not sure if it's where you're referring to but there's a little pond with loads of bloodleaf, just south of the water park in the toxic valley, there's a small town and shooting range right near by and cryptids spawn there quite often, would recommend.
---
I only solo, Had another squatch show up a few times. Love it, 2 1 star legendary items.
---
Trading posts aren't allowed here anymore.
---
If they took the pvp mechanics out of workshops people would just claim them all and there wouldn't be anything you could do about it
---
Dang I am missing out, just been using speed demon for a couple months..I'm gonna get hooked up asap
---
Seems like a ‚Äúsend orbital strike here!‚Äù message for griefers. LOVE IT!
---
Stash, it can be used from your stash when you craft.
---
East from ‚Äútop of the world‚Äù to the lake by the road.  Follow the draining river.
---
have y‚Äôall ever seen the item sitting on the ground next to the enemy?  it‚Äôs happened to me a handful of times now.
---
I always keep a swimsuit on me just in case I come across a camp on the water. If the person is home and they have a pier/deck, I‚Äôll throw on my swimsuit in front of them and dive into the water. I‚Äôve had two people join in with me, one skinny dipped. 
---
Also, if I find someone‚Äôs camp and they aren‚Äôt home, I turn off all of the lights or close/open all the shutters. It‚Äôs a fun time.
---
Yeah. I like the game and all but the revs need to seriously be hounded about this. Pretty sure it's something to do with the horrible server instability and the disconnects while moving shit around.
---
There are a lot of people who downvote posts like this because they think it's not true. It does happen but because it's downvoted I don't think it gets the attention it deserves.
---
I'm pretty sure people were reporting it before then.  
---
Even though I haven't noticed anything missing, I'm starting to think I should take the time to use an inventory management sheet like some have.
---
There's just been too many reports for me to say, "hasn't happened to me, must be people's imagination."
---
also, ever since the reports have been flooding in, I've been too afraid to even get my only legacy weapon out of my stash, even though I've never even tried using it. It's just too risky until this is figured out.
---
I haven't had any issues but maybe it's because you use a mule character
---
Try the event Breach and Clear. In the Ash Heap, bottom left on map. I usually see level 22-40 miners (as a lvl 80+) there that drop items you can scrap for it and the big drill you defend has some in ore form in the compartments, but you'll need acid to smelt it.
---
Yeah, I thought this was all bullshit, then my chest disappeared off my excavator armor
---
No big issue, easily replaced
---
Vanished during a fast travel to Whitesprings station. Instantly made me over encumbered
---
Hey I lost a whole set of excavator power armor to a glitch
---
Yeah I didn't even jump to conclusions that it happened. I was just curious if anybody else has had things suspiciously vanish.
---
I can't express how much I look forward to the next time that it's available, I completely missed it this time but I really look forward to participating in the future
---
PS4. Needs to be a MK19 too since the M79 doesn't benefit from right to bear arms. Thanks though.
---
I mean, allegedly. They said it'd happen on the next patch like 2 patches ago I feel like, but as with everything I think they'll eventually get it. But yeah, it's a huge issue they've acknowledged and are working on. I think they actually thought everyone that was into PvP would go to the Survival server, but what happened is dicks are still being dicks in Adventure. 
---
PvP in Adventure just irks me, a lot. I even don't like that workshops put you in PvP. I hate it. I just wanna make some extra fusion cores, not have some douchebags follow me home and orbital strike my house while headshoting me. Not what I call fun, at all.  Having to rebuild my rad arch was so infuriating. 
---
If you're on PC, I can help you rebuild if you still want to play. I'm not much into being in a group very often, but don't mind helping out now and then.
---
I didn't believe it for months but I wouldn't lose track of such a gun and I've been losing random power armor pieces off my frames a lot lately.
---
I'm pretty salty right now. Before today I just shrugged it off. Now I'm crying inside but it's just a game. So I'll live.
---
Could be straight up followers or scavengers too. I mean fo4 dedicated an entire dlc to that idea.
---
make sure you scrap it before putting it in your stash to save weight and room in your stash.
---
I know I got that one down there, and I think it's the right one. Like, 99% sure. :p
---
You monster!
---
98 NAR. You can get one from the sentry there, I do it as part of my daily routine
---
More to the point, why do the weights not weigh what they weigh?
---
PS4, thanks though. Really needs to be an auto one, for whatever reason it does more damage per shot than the M79 and benefits from right to bear arms making it quite a bit lighter.
---
Player vending: coming soon
---
That's what I'm saying I mean it was there before why not implement it. I mean how many supplies dont you lose while wondering around and forget to get them or you're just too busy saving Appalachia from the terror of the queen üëë
---
i put 900 hours into my account and they banned me for hoarding too much ammo. which i then proved i didnt have. they dont care. there are not humans looking into this. its garbage but there really is nothing we can do.
---
Yeah, a lot of people have this problem, including myself.
---
That‚Äôs dirty lol
---
Scrap it and Stash it.
---
I agree with you but I‚Äôm really not looking forward to fighting Wendigos in the night
---
It‚Äôs probably a coincidence but after I took some eggs from Point Pleasant I had an aggressive Mothman show up at my house all the way near the top right of the map trying to kill me. I‚Äôve only seen max 4 of them in my 190 hours.
---
Seems awfully quick... Wonder what the Code word was this week?  
---
Wouldn't surprise me if it was Datamined, instead of farming it and solving it legitimately.
---
Yeah that's fair and could be logically explained lore-wise as i said. Perk-cards are not. 
---
Bethesda should just implement that function in the perks menu.
---
Same here.
---
Yeah it sucks. I've heard if you start a new character, it might trigger, but I'm not sure if that really works.
---
How tho
---
My weekly says I have 1.8 billions days to complete it
---
Just had it happen during free range
---
I know the recipes one finally completed on a new character for me.
---
Scrap, stash, and always have a stash box nearby
---
Sometimes she gets separated from Grahm
---
Serums are the real currency.
---
Chally is the Moo-Moo that follows everyone's favorite green meat-lover, Grahm. he is a traveling merchant, who loves to show you his if you show him yours.
---
That's the name of the traveling super mutant trader's Brahmin. The name pool must have glitched or something.
---
Hop around a few servers and join a scorched earth quest. You get a bunch of stable flux in the loot table for beating the quest.
---
Yeah, she'll get stuck on something and Graham keeps walking and then she will try to catch up.
---
Maybe someone know about herd mentality? How much special points it reduce  when ure solo with perk card?
---
Don‚Äôt forget we‚Äôll need a 3x3 diamond block foundation and we are good to go
---
Spruce Knob Channels is pretty good, just east of R&amp;G Station. That might be where you were.
---
I do not think I have ever seen Grahm. With this encounter one day I hope to meet him!
---
&gt; I was inspecting it, it disappeared!  
---
  
---
Why the hell are you inpecting it, just pick everything up man, inspect and decide what to keep later
---
I think I'm there. Some bloodleaf, there's definitely some snap tail, a wharf. Its east of the Mothman museum. There's a cabin just north of it that's on the map.
---
you need more in INT. so you can run gunsmith because the harpoon gun with the Flechette mod breaks quickly

I love using chameleon to sneak in their camp house while they‚Äôre building outside. Then run away when they find me.

Truth, and it's fucking infuriating. The whole idea of the production system is to make that stuff on demand.
---
This has been my experience at westek for about a month now. With the watoga, westek, and white spring legendary nerf I'm having a hard time finding ways to entertain myself with this game anymore. Hell, the sheepsquatch events are spawning one star and no star legendaries.
---
You saw it was a 2 shot black powder weapon and decided to sit and chill with it in a loot pile before picking it up, **knowing this game has issues with disappearing loot**.  
---
What I am saying is a tip, pick everything up then decide later
---
Thank you for taking the time to put this together.
---
What would you say is an ideal armor setup? Something like:
---
Chameleon + Sentinel x1
---
Vanguard + Sentinel x4
---
And ignoring assassin since it won't protect you against vats crits?
---
Another question: how viable and efficient is an ideal pvp build for normal play? Is it easily adaptable if you swap in a bloodied weapon and getting to 19% HP?
---
The main reason I've avoided survival mode is because I'm a max efficiency PvE player - I use a bloodied power armor build and am always at 10-19% HP (never die in pve either, unless I want to in order to proc revenant) and a heavy weapons user (again - for efficiency and because that's my preferred play style - hard and fast, no stealth, just run in and steam roll it all). I have a vats crit sniper build character as well, but it is way less efficient than my heavy weapons character, despite having good gear - having to stealth everywhere, more frequent reloads, and just generally far less dps, especially on SBQ.
---
I find myself asking, "What is the point of playing survival with a character that is really only good at pvp and very suboptimal at pve?". The rewards have been mostly garbage, though I did pick up the Last Action hero on both of my accounts, but that's mainly because I'm praying that I can reroll the Two-Shot to Bloodied or AA for a GG end game pve weapon. As far as making caps through pvp goes - I don't really need caps anymore, having one account maxed out and working on the second, but even if I did, I can farm up 500+ violet flux in a week which would be 50K caps minimum. Maybe I could do that well in pvp, but I kind of doubt it, and the investment required to gear such a character is staggering. But again, caps don't really matter in this game. You can easily do PvE things and earn caps far faster with far less investment.
---
So what is left? Sense of pride and accomplishment? But it's so random. If you DO happen to have best in slot gear and go up against someone else with a best in slot meta gear build, the outcome will be determined mostly by luck. And if you're running that build, spent all that time getting all that gear, which if you got it legitimately, hats off to ya, because that's probably 500-700 hours of farming minimum. But at that point,  I guess the ONLY thing you're looking for on survival mode is a death match, to prove you're the best. There's nothing wrong with that , but to me, as a player who values efficiency and isn't quite there yet with his pvp gear, it feels pointless to step foot onto survival. If I want to FARM, I'm far better off on adventure mode, where I can freely run an optimal build and farm without any fear, without having to micromanage my caps, my aid items on my character, and worry all the time. If I already have all that gear then I'm just there to PvP... and again... what's the point?
---
When I was a hardcore PvP player in SWTOR, there was a point. I got a reputation, being one of the most feared Sith Maurauders there was. My skill and my gear, along with my knowledge of how to counter other classes, made me a scary opponent. The rewards were also fantastic. PvP exclusive mounts, armor, and weapons for the top ranked arena teams. These weren't better stat wise, just looked insanely badass and were a status symbol. Also, titles. Further, being part of the best US Imperial PvP guild was a huge point of pride. When you saw us enter the warzone, you knew you  were fucked. 
---
I'm going off on a tangent here. I'll just sum it up by saying thank you for making this post, but it just reinforces that PvP in this game is very flawed and I see no reason to participate. I'll do what it takes to get gear in survival if I really want it, but playing there full time doesn't add anything of value to the game for me.
---
Alright, very cool. Good to know. I was hoping max Luck of the Draw would proc enough with Flechette to offset that, but I didn't realize the ammo type had an effect on deterioration. How many points put into it are worthwhile?
---
Came here just to make this comment. Was beaten to it.
---
This is simplistic hilarity at its finest, I tell ya wHat.
---
Oh shit! I just chose the T-51b for nostalgia‚Äôs sake and because it‚Äôs the game‚Äôs face when it comes to advertising it. Wow. I thought the X-01 was the best in the game, like in 4. Guess I‚Äôll keep it forever lol
---
Actually the m79 benefits from right to bear arms as well. Mine weighs .78 on my heavy weapons toon. Also I'm looking at them right now on my heavy weapons toon, they do the same damage per shot, 238. So you're wrong about the m79 on both accounts. I believe it used to, not sure when that changed or if I'm wrong and they've always done the same damage per shot. That said, the m79 only holds one shot and has to reload, so the agl can unload lots of explosives faster putting out far more DPS.
---
If you're looking for alternative heavy weapons to use, I'd skip explosives and look into energy heavy weapons tbh. Gatling plasma and gatling laser are both pretty good these days. Most specifically, the gatling plasma might be one of the highest dps weapons in game. It's kinda fucking outrageous.
---
\^this\^
---
you add the card kill something, then remove the card kill something. repeat this and you get damage that stacks and as long as you remember to remove the card then kill something you keep the accumulated damage bonus.

i made a small tweek.
---
Don't think I'm not holding on to those excess masks I have in my inventory just in case of something like that.
---
I mean, it seems Phoenix is just invincible, but he RUINS everything once he even gets looked at funny. I usually have to go kill everything around him otherwise he'll just keep rampaging.
---
I just tested it and you are right. The 15% faster VATS gives 15 extra flat, which equals to 1 level of critical savvy, which saves 11 in luck (I guess there were some rounding that benefited us).
---
15% faster vats is rocking!
---
Fuckin pumped already
---
I was looking for the random spawn vendor bot over by Charleston station,  and as I went over one of the railway bridges I heard Grahm talking to Chally. But this was the first time I'd run into Grahm since the beta, so don't  be surprised if he doesn't pop up somewhere random.
---
Damn, good call on Grenadier!
---
Lure? I am pretty sure the Imposter would wreck it though.
---
now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure Clubber could be a Melee Stagger perk, perhaps like One-man army, where it grants the user a % chance to stagger an opponent. If so, would totally use it with the Ripper or Mr. Handy Buzzsaw.
---
Sheepsquatch
---
Nice
---
We killed a Sheepsquatch in the bog ..... no event , and disappared after the kill with all his loot ........ and he was a three star legy ......
---
Think there was a May 7th patch with a new quest?
---
Yes! Exactly!
---
one more thing, the speed bonuses of both speed demon and lock and load do stack on the harpoon gun, but there will be a delay in the time you can fire after the reload finishes
---
you have to be on the roof
---
Means your CAMP was probably attacked while you gone, maybe? Is it in a zone that gets agro'd a lot?
---
By chance where did you get this info from cause theres a few points that are very wrong and hopefully can clear it up
---
How strange. Is it to the point that it makes having both a redundancy?
---
Don‚Äôt take a photo from outside the elevator...drop down 1 floor where the ceiling is damaged and take a pic...worked for me, hope this helps
---
I can confirm this does work.
---
You still on? I‚Äôm on right now and have bobble head
---
I just made a post about being annoyed I got a good 3 tier legendary with sentinel except it was level 40 not 50, and a few people said it doesnt matter the level
---
Did you leave spoiled food and a grenade in it?
---
Well that's random, but successful! Thank you.
---
Nope. Nothing there. I triple checked, it just marks the workbench.
---
Works on top as well, just specific spots .. it's been picky ..
---
Glad I could help
---
Honestly? I don't know. But it's nice to at least see that Bethesda's community managers are about and interacting within the community.
---
Not 100% but the 15% reduction basically means you arent taking 15%damage at all and it doesnt add dr and level may never matter cause if the effects are good on a lvl 5 peice and you got a shitty lvl 50 you might choose the lvl5 or sell it cause low lever ones sell for alot and as a heads up wood armor cant have sential or cav its a 3rd effect and wood armor can only drop as one stars
---
I figure I can blow a Torso Mod and use Medic Pump instead of Born Survivor (I wonder what percentage it activates at and of it has a reset timer?) 
---
Also I think I could live with 5 in Gunsmith if I shuck Luck of the Draw and tag in Weapon Artisan when in C.A.M.P. Just doesn't make sense to hang onto LotD when it doesn't trigger on over-repaired items.
---

---
for the most part, yes. id keep speed demon, and maybe replace lock and load
---
Alright, very cool. Let me shift some things around!
---
I use multiple mules and have not run into this issue. Not saying it doesn't happen though.
---
Oh man for some reason I wasnt interpreting the 15 percent as a percentage, i was interpreting it as damage points. And yeah I know about the wood armor it was just an example of something said on my last post
---
Weigh*. Holy shit that error was annoying
---
Cowabunga it is!!!
---
Oh, my bad, I must've been really tired - I'll fix it now
---
I prefer being called bussiness man :D 
---
Btw: it is not like i would like to steal caps from people, but i did that crazy event like 60times and i have only one second copy of most plans. Can't sell it cheap.
---
I don't need to decide on something I already know. I don't cheat. They were just sore losers. They had over 300 levels between them. Nothing I was doing could even remotely be considered cheating. Hell, I died three times during the ordeal. Yet they all conspire to falsely report me. And they even encouraged random passerby's to report me as well.
---
They curse me out, try to abuse the report system, and encourage others to do the same all because they couldn't win in a **mutually consented duel**, but I'm the bad guy because I like PVP?
---
It would also be difficult for me to play during the IRL day due to IRL light reflecting off the TV screen. I spend most of my time playing in the evenings though, so usually it's not such a big deal.
---
I played the beta around a week before release, and at that point night was definitely too dark to play.
---
Yeah the percentage and dr things are very commonly misinterpreted same for assassins when you stack cav or sent with assassins a full set you at like 135 damage reduced 75 from cav or sent then the rest from assassins making you some what unkillable unless using tactics you probably knew that part tho they sell alot so its good to know the effects and the advantages
---
So I have to ask, if this is such a rampant problem how come nobody can record it happening or replicate it? I'm almost 1000 hours and I haven't lost anything. I was told I would eventually, but still nothing. I've actually been *expecting* it, upped my PS4's record time to an hour, stash almost completely full.
---
i have TSE minigun. you need over 6k 5mm amo on SBQ
---
You gotta wait for low level to travel, spawn them in then YOU need to kill them. It's super dumb and took me a few weeks to complete it.
---
LMFAO I spawned into a world once for a SBQ &amp; it couldn‚Äôt load my base in, so I went into the house built on my property &amp; turned off every sign &amp; light he had. Felt like a total griefer
---
from over 10times he was only once 3\*. waste of time
---
&gt; IMO They should have made the robots act like the WS robots.
---
Wouldn't work without making the robots significantly more difficult. Most of the protectrons were one-hit kills to a sufficiently leveled up character, and there aren't enough assualtrons in Watoga to make difficult.
---
Burning barbed I‚Äôm pretty sure. But electric is a good alternative.
---
I got mine by building a deathclaw trap (bunch of turrets on a platform in the river) across from Deathclaw island. You build that and then go trigger the deathclaw, shoot it once and then book it for your camp, they cant swim and the turrets can take care of it for you.
---
What do you think? Junk Shield? Glow Sight? Or go back to Luck of the Draw for when the over-repair runs out? Or, like Grenadier, is there something better I'm looking straight past? I'd do Marathoner for quality of life reasons but I'll be using Power Armor.
---
Okay fine I am dense. Say the game wiki needs more shit. Don't call it an MMO when it just is not. Sorry not sorry.
---
&gt; I prefer being called bussiness man :D 
---
Isn't that what I called you?
---
Honestly, I'm giving you grief but no harm intended, what you do with the rewards you get are your business and right. You won't get real argument from me. Just jokes.
---
You monster.
---
I was apprehensive about this game tbh. I loved 3 and new Vegas, 4 was OK. I love the environment in 76, the looting, crafting and stuff is cool. The game really does not lose out on not having NPCs I honestly prefer it that way. I love reading about the different story‚Äôs each building and environment has. I‚Äôm only level 15 but so far I‚Äôm having just as much if not more fun than the regular games.
---
Poor guy looks like his brain just broke
---
I can imagine they do it because you are every fucking time out of ammo. Oh my god, why did i respect from being melee to sneak rifle.
---
I clearly remember during the first week of regular gameplay that a lot of game reviewers were literally just trying to slap damage any players they came across, especially any who were AFK or reading a terminal, as soon as they hit level 5.  Then when they couldn't manage to kill them before they ran away and couldn't get anyone to fight back declared the game was trash.
---
Fuck that all I care about is May 7th
---
Don't forget that streamers have recorded tens of thousands of hours of video and not one person has an evidence of this actually happening.
---
Simplest explanation is user error. The UI is not great, often lags, and makes it easy to sell/drop the wrong items.
---
I don't PvP much, personally not my taste. But recently, I've noticed that more and more squads of PvP equipped players come into Adventure and kill those who have taken workshops. Since, you know, you lose your level worth of caps on Adventure but only 25% of your level in caps in Survival. Super dumb in my opinion, basically makes my life 10x harder since I'm a lvl 160+ and any workshop I take I just get melted by 4 TSE shotguns. Doesn't help I'm a bloodied build. But I digress.
---
You are correct, there is nothing to do in adventure mode anymore. I tend to just walk around and team up with lower levels and give them gear, or help them out. By punching everything. 
---
The game has gotten so boring that I forgot to buy the plauge armor üôÑ. Just never crossed my mind to get on it because the second I load in, I quit because there's nothing to do, other than PvPing that gets boring.. real quick. I was super hyped over the burrows.. then I did the quest in 5 minutes because someone infront of me opened all the doors. Super disappointing that "DLC" was. 
---
I'm a huge fan of Fallout, I just love the lore behind it, but if Bethesda doesn't get their crap together I highly doubt I'll be staying anymore üò¨
---
ü¶û
---
Most of the youtube content around this game is catered toward the toxic crowd that probably isn't even playing or shitposting anymore. It's all the usual stuff like "FALLOUT 76 IS DEAD OMEGALUL" or "You'll NEVER BELIEVE how many infants Bethesda slaughtered at their HQ since the last update!" I don't have a solid explanation as to why that is, since I don't watch any of these people, but it's probably just appealing to that same demographic
---
I kind of expect lower levels to still do this occasionally. I usually disable their turrets. If the don't take the hint, I blow up a bench or something. If they still don't take the hint, I level it. But I saw a massive missile turret and heavy machine gun turret base the other day, and it belonged to a level 100+. There's no excuse for that. I just started with the fusion generator, power armor frame and turrets, and continued from there. Racked up a 400 cap bounty.
---
I freak out when 2 out of 3 Brahmin run from the enclosure in 2 different directions when the squatch pops up. I'm really trying to protect them, but they're making it real hard.
---
According to the roadmap, we get Ever Upwards and player vending May 7th. So probably nothing this week
---
Your literally asking for a "participation award"? Like, dont have to earn it. Just get it handed to you?..
---
of course they have. do you have a reading comprehension issue?
---
Scrap stash and bulk as often as possible. People are always willing to buy bulked junk or you can sell it to vendors for easy caps
---
A robot feature is listed on the roadmap. Making it a customizable one is the dream.
---
If this is truly happening so often, then it can't all be user error. I know there are some bugs with the UI that can cause you to do things you're not trying to (especially when spamming a command or loading in), but there's no way it would happen to that many people.
---
However, that's assuming it's actually true. We had hundreds of independent reports of trade stealing, and that turned out to be a complete lie that never existed.
---
Can you nut up and ban "the game is great but PLEASE BETHESDA ADD BLAH BLAH" posts?
---
Like I said I think it has to do with a disconnect while storing or trading things. Like they get lost in between inventories
---
Great
---
You show offline
---
As much as I love my blackbird paint, I wouldn't mind if newer players got a chance at it. Plenty of older players were just taking a break or too busy or something at the time. A 5 day sale in a video game that you don't find out about unless you check the atom store or the subreddit on a daily basis is not very consumer-friendly

Oh dam I gotta read it again bur imagine a bos robot in youre camp with custom skins

[I may eat you if i am hungry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=1s), but if you give me something to eat, i will be good boi. Yesterday for example i joined party of tin can mans (BoS) they were talking nonsense, and documented every mutated creature, who cares, i was silently stealing shiny things from what they killed, no need to fight.

If you want call us raiders bad boiz, you can be dead soon, you know? Be aware little boi.

I think part of the problem is the darned glowing ground, why is that even a thing outside the Toxic Valley?

In the Forest there are a pair of ponds well-shaded by trees with quite a bit of bloodleaf and glowing fungus just SW of the "haunted lodges" (the ones with the automated screaming and poltergeist SFX). There are 3-4 beehives a bit northerly from these ponds. In the general vicinity there are soot flowers, a good quantity of fallen trees for wood and a smattering of silt beans. A 5 cap hop puts you into Flatwoods.

Before survival i killed too fucking much people, never touch their junk. Now i have so big problems with feeding my handmade, i will loot even people i didn't kill. I NEED YOUR LEAD, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT!
---
Yes I found a legendry one in Welch fighting a scorched. Neither of them seemed to be doing any damage to one another.

It‚Äôs one of the three new weapons you can get from the Free Range event. There‚Äôs the sheepsquatch club, staff, and crook. They all different mods which also drop as plans, and they alter the look of the weapons a bit. Some include burning, burning barbed, electrified, poisoned, and heavy (for the club and staff). And horned, glass covered, electric, and maybe some others for the crook.
---
5th? I thought i played a lot when i hit lvl 100 on my alt (main lvl 260)

My perks are not stable and my build is a heavy gunner/ unarmed melee build. 15S 1P 7E 4-5C 10I 8A 11L and perks that help my build. Unyielding armor set, radicool and a bloodied unarmed weapon is a must have for this set.
---
It was solved legitimately. I was part of the group that solved it.
---
I personally collected the Charlie pieces (B-5, D-6, E-8, F-0, I-3, J-5, K-2, L-2), which were then input into the solver at NukaCrypt.com. Another team member then ran the possible codes at the Silo until the solution was found. This is how everyone who is currently solving does it. There is no "datamining" involved.
---
The code was then passed onto others, who tested it again in order to confirm that it was correct, before it was then posted on NukaCrypt.com.
---
It was nice of you to register an account on Reddit only yesterday, just the purpose of making unfounded and harassing comments. I hope you enjoy your time on Reddit.
---
I still don't understand how people lose things, never happened to me in 500 hours, only thing i noticed i have problems with exiting vats and often jump in pipboy droping some item i must pick, but never have anything dispeared without my bad.
---
Alright thanks!
---
Yeah thats true but atleast for me i want something with more range and mobility as a secondary
---
Oh, you innocent child, the cap limit *already* isn't enough to purchase some items. Go on the market subs.
---
No problem. And here are the staff mods just to see them. The club is like a one handed version of this and the horns are cut off, but the skull is still just like on the staff
---
I'll sell you any mask for 1k and any plan or recipe for 2k.

It's a terrible mechanic, but they do warn you that you open yourself up to PvP when you claim them. 
---
What would happen if there was no option to contest workshops? 
---
They just need to change it to:
---
1) you can only engage in PvP inside the workshop area, not anywhere on the map. 
---
2) have the ability to relinquish workshops if you no longer want them.
---
You butchered that spelling there
---
Considering Wood Armor can only drop at 1* you can't even get Sentinel on it lol
---
Got it!  Joining

I had like 100 something stimpacks, a lot of steel, and a good supply of basic supplies. I snuck near some people‚Äôs camp (three friends playing together).
---
Me: ‚Äú psst... hey.. want some stimpacks? Ammo? Steel? Purified Water?‚Äù

Had a great time lol

Thank you.... so much!!!!

It's because you're not using the platinum plated HDMI cables, some of the lead is leaking out.

This is why you hire Biv for a party

I have one on XB1 so they def do exist - been holding onto it as trade bait since they're not easy to find

It‚Äôs called lack of QA. You know the problem the game has faced from day one.
---
Maybe three or four ghouls, but my rocket and heavy MG turrets would make quick work of them.
---
Define brand new. One can spend 300 hours in-game without hitting 100th+ level. I'm north of 240 hours in-game and only hit the mid-60's level band due to the x2 XP weekend.
---
I wish every day was Fasnacht Day.
---
Oh, I would still buy them. That's a crapload of caps but still, caps are just caps and everone can farm them with enough time. I've seen people doing this in Warframe with premium currency whenever a Prime becomes unobtainable.
---
Some of like to sneak and not have to use a giant torch.
---
Aww.
---
I remember legit being nervous about exploring the top left of the fo3 map because of the roaming deathclaw horde. Or shooting out their kneecaps being a primary strat
---
you are just gonna get tokens for turning in your legendaries and you will use those tokens to reroll your current gear
---
That is so cute. :D
---
Because sentinel is not dr but 15% so if you have 5/5set you have 75% damage reduction if not staggered. Thats way stronger than any DR or ER or whatever.
---
Did he call the shit poop?
---
The very top of the radio spire on the top(I‚Äôm not even sure you can get there without a jet pack) also works.
---
Weird, I dunno.
---
I think the real issue is that there are potentially multiple issues that could result in the same or similar issue and that most of those impacted often don't notice right away.  I can say that I have had things vanish from my inventory (not permanently, they returned later on), accidentally scrap an item not intended due to the interface switching, and having my inventory list incorrectly after trading.  While I can't say that the issue is definitely real, I don't completely dismiss it either (and due to the number of people that have said they began to notice it once they started keeping an inventory, I wouldn't be too surprised if it happens more than is known with people just not realizing it since losing things like some junk/ammo/aid items could be easily ignored unless you were tracking them dilligently).  That being said, I can also see questioning if there are other issues that may have caused it (like inventory listing issues that occur during scrapping, selling, and trading).
---
 [I did fight with people before survival for fun.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvjbOZOuTCg&amp;t=1s) After meeting too much sentinel/assasin guys on survival i am not interested in pvp anymore.  It is just not fun, when you can oneshot everything in game only one guy who have some idiotic godmode gear, i would feel ashamed if i had one too. Nubs.

"Sar\*casm: *noun* \-  the use of irony to mock or convey contempt"
---
Funny thing is, I don't see "funny" in the description, but I *do* see "mock" and "contempt", which is rather the point, and you've made it quite well for me. Sarcasm is not a tone, it is not comedy, and requiring those things to identify sarcasm rather indicates you don't know what sarcasm is, and therefor should not try to correct others about its usage.
---
You suck at sarcasm, is what I'm saying.

THIS TIME ILL GET A COOL MASK!

I have a jetpack and marsupial and I kept falling off before I could get a pic lol

Next to the road on the foot of the cliff with the investigator's shack in the savage divide. Lots of flat ground, plenty of wood and raspberries. No resource nodes but my melee build character doesn't need those anyway. I get attacked by super mutants from the rest stop down the road or by scorched coming down the hill but it's never
---
A problem - just a nuisance.
---
If you ever come across a brick building with "BOOZE" written on the front, lots of marquee arrows and a ton of TVs outside, feel free to use my facilities and take some water from the purifier! Just stay out of the shack in the back...
---
You handled that perfectly. I help anyone I run across and let them tag anything before I kill it... Only rarely I've encountered people not recognizing that, and have promptly given them bad days as well.
---
What's even weirder is that second floor walls and my generator on the roof would be destroyed.
---
Pretty sure its been reported since the beta (at least I recall comments going back to around then, and recall at least one of my friends mentioning it just after launch, though I can't say if that was actually vanishing or an inventory screen issue that resulted in them selling/scrapping/losing the item).
---
hard to say for sure that's what they're for. maybe if it was something we had to earn from an event then there'd be a cause for keeping it locked away. However, this was something we purchased.
---
Also consider that some items have already returned to the shop after leaving, so it's probably only a matter of time before the more popular item in the shop returns.
---
Are they an actual, real world friend, or some person you met online? Because honestly and personally, I would not value anyone who acted that way at me, but I am also admittedly less social than an average human, so I place less value in having a peer group to interact with.
---
Could you make it for me? , I am XBOX.
---
You can change their spawn location from being at your Camp by simply having them die away from your Camp. Spawn in run away from your Camp have them chase you and then kill them away from it. Basically you need to keep pushing them back and I'll keep responding farther and farther. If they're too good in PvP and you can't actually kill them block them and change servers. That's the end of it but yes I agree with you I do not think it's working as intended
---
Like, I get the idea, it's a work tool, it needs to sound like a machine, but maybe they could not make a repetitive high pitched sound with every step?
---
I got a refund for the winter holiday emote pack they had awhile back, but I had requested the refund within 4 hours of purchasing it, got my 1200 atoms back, but I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll give you the atoms back if it‚Äôs been more than a couple days

I swear, it looks like he's drunk and yarfing into my house.
---
So many people put the game down in the beginning because of all the launch issues. Then people have their IRL stuff or are playing other games ‚Äì which is why I created my YT channel to watch the shop ;)
---
Glad you think so. I thought the froggy was a lil' charmer as well.
---
There‚Äôs dead aliens in a truck? Where?
---
I'd enjoy the ability to remap every function in the options, including holding ALT to hold breath since it's my discord push to talk and I'm not changing it.
---
You can probably buy one of those for just like 1k on the market subs if you want to make it up.
---
I've found that there's quite a bit more to do. The Burrows (while not an actual dungeon) is a cool place in terms of both design and the fact that it's a fairly decent place to farm legendaries since it's more of a location than a dungeon. With adventure/survival mode being split, there's less issues with griefing/unwanted pvp. CAMP building is something that I've always found fun, and that's gotten some tweaks to make life a bit easier, as well as some new items being added. The new wilderness scouts questline is coming out soon. There's the Sheepsquatch server event which (IMO) is better endgame content than a SBQ. Player vending is also in the chute from what I've heard. I know they delayed it to prioritize the sheepsquatch stuff. There's also going to be a legendary vendor at some point soon that will let you essentially pick your own legendary mods for your weapons/armor.
---
which ones are you counting as the 2? For example I know the Mothman Frame and the Flower Door came back, but I don't remember if there are more off the top of my head
---
HYPE!

Does it to me too

That's one of the cutest thing I seen in awhile

How hard can it be to write this wrong when it literally is on your screen whenever you did the event ?
---
Thanks for the clarification
---
Could be something with performance enhancements, my camp has had sizable amounts of grass and random clutter removed in certain areas after one of the March patches. Weird thing is, on my 2014 Xbox one I get better performance than my friend on a new Xbox One X, some things about how this game operates really confuse me
---
Can you stim someone you kill?  If so, I think that would be the best way to teach them a lesson.  Merciful but firm.
---
STANLEY WAKE UP ITS PRETZEL DAY
---
Does this happen every time? Or just like randomly sometimes? Maybe it was a random spawn scortchbeast?
---
I haven‚Äôt had this happen, nor do I know anyone that has, but to me it seems like something that could happen. 
---
As for why no one has been able to capture this, if, for example it would have to do with a sudden disconnect/crash, if the user turns off their console or similar only to find their item missing on startup you wouldn‚Äôt be able to capture that as easy as if it just disappeared mid-combat. 
---
It‚Äôs perfectly possible it is user error, a bug that causes items disappearing, or both. Either way, the suprisingly high amount of people that claim to have lost items have made me too damn paranoid üòê
---
it's /r/fo76. No post is complete without someone bitching like a child about the game they spent... fuck, 600+ hours? Even with the stupid power armor edition, that's what, $0.33 per hour of value? Who the hell bitches about that?
---
\*Checks post history\*... Oh. Banned for their totally legit ammo. Righto, carry on then, nothing to see here...
---
It happens randomly, mostly happens when I spawn into a new world.
---
There's a difference between an excuse, and a super easy workaround of a known issue. Does it suck? Yes. But is it avoidable the majority of the time? Yes. 
---
Don't. Take. Chances. With. Legendary. Loot.
---
I log in every day, and at minimum do the two to three challenges that take zero real effort. Fifteen minutes max, that's my limit on atom farming, and it still gets me 20-30 per day.
---
Every time I see someone else there. Every. Time.
---
The state of the game is that this question and ‚Äúshould I come back‚Äù are asked dozens of times a day here.
---
I got into a server yesterday and a player messaged me saying there was a server wide flea market at whitesprings, me and about 11-12 others were there and the trading was fairly decent, nothing too absurd or crazily priced, i got a bloodied ski sword and a BOS pilot outfit for 1k caps. It was a fun time. The trading subreddits lately though have been absolutely swamped with people wanting god tier gear and are offering/asking for ridiculous prices. IMO even though trading with random people on servers can be sketchy, you can get better deals than on the trading subs, but that‚Äôs just my own experience
---
I'm glad you think so. :)
---
He's so tired. Damn them for making him pull obviously one too many shifts...
---
Until they fix workshops it‚Äôs going to keep happening.
---
Same with your comments guy
---
Fasnacht.
---
Thanks guys, I really appreciate the info...after wasting several hours I just waltzed in Harper's Ferry and bought the plans for like 1,4k caps...straight away. Well now to grind the suppressor, then... :-)
---
The perk appears to be written correctly. It's only 0.3% chance per hit, so maybe you just had a bad run of luck.
---
White Knight is about twice as strong per perk point, and not random.
---
I wuv those frogs. :3
---
Don‚Äôt take workshops if you do not want pvp

Nuke The Burrows.
---
I‚Äôm a melee player so I‚Äôm always getting lit up. Its just how it is and it‚Äôs not a big deal. The level 14 had to attack me 2 or 3 times before I even released it wasn‚Äôt just a late hit he was shooting at me. I‚Äôm thinking to my self man you are trying to start something you can‚Äôt finish. Then his body started giving me the angry emoji. That just kind of confused me a little like what did I do? I realize I‚Äôm on the higher end of the spectrum when it come to player level, but I still have things to grind out just like they do.
---
If you think that bad, check one of the weekly challenges that want you to win 5 hunter matches, each time wearing an expensive atomshop outfit lol. This is why I never bother with these.
---
Loving your red C3PO arm (and leg)
---
Never said anything about sneak attacks not working, they do, but they only go up to the damage cap of 190. I said something about the damage cap, and I never wanted to know how you performed in PvP. Not the point of the post.
---
The damage cap is 190. That‚Äôs hard and true, but there‚Äôs ways to one shot opponents still.
---
Given your market history, you use a lot of guns that have multiple pellets.
---
Shotguns are pretty meta because each pellet counts as a separate shot. 
---
Dragons and Laser splitter also work in this fashion, multiple pellet guns.
---
I used all 3 of these weapons and so many more.
---
Harpoon guns are particularly interesting.
---
Bloodied, falls flat because the 190 can be reached easily by other effects, that‚Äôs why you need other, better effects like AA. But I suppose shooting through walls is easier to accept.
---
I spent about 2 weeks and 100+ hours compiling this information and condensing it.
---
Anti armor
---
I must admit that FO76 has all the best aspects of FO4 and none of the negative aspects IMHO! I really disliked the shoddily written dialogue and NPC's from FO4, but then again I really loved scouring the wastes, finding little bits of environmental story telling, non quest related notes and holotapes &amp;c.
---
This game was a pleasant surprise and it's my favourite game atm.
---
being farmed?  Not even sure what that is supposed to mean but if you mean code pieces.. we have a team of awesome, dedicated players that work very hard each week to solve.  We "farm" our own code pieces and our own nuclear key cards all week long.  We use nukacrypt to get possible codes and we can all clear a silo solo with no issues allowing us to be ready to enter the possible codes and solve the silo as fast as possible at reset!  It's really not that hard you should try it before jumping to conclusions.  Some people just don't like to do the work though, we however do enjoy it every Monday.  I don't have any clue how to data mine and if that were even possible don't you think people would have already posted the codes if they could be mined???
---
I think you can but to stim someone like that cost a bunch of stims. I didn‚Äôt take their junk they dropped and that‚Äôs about as nice as I‚Äôll be.
---
Or "sneak attack 3x damage"
---
I guess 3 x 0 = 0
---
Maybe it's that 5% chance to miss, but it shouldn't look like you made the hit if you didnt.
---
you're welcome son now get out there and launch some nukes because i need some flux!
---
I‚Äôve got 2* suppressor Dcg w/ swing speed if you‚Äôre looking
---
That‚Äôs the flatwoods monster which is an alien but doesn‚Äôt count as one for the camera challenges
---
I‚Äôd say your suggested setup is quite meta at the moment.
---
Assassin is disregarded by Vats Crits. Vanguard isn‚Äôt.
---
Those remarks about PvP are very true right now. The nerf to survival deleted all the risk and reward to it. I do think it should revert to how it was before this nerf.
---
PvP characters like the one I have do well in PvP and PVE when the optimal weapon is garnered, but usually, PvP characters suck at PVE.
---
I managed to eliminate four Sheepsquatches during the xp weekend. Two from event and two wild.
---
Oh and btw you thought this was fast??  We were way faster last week.
---
The 25-pound weight actually contains only 10 pounds of lead.  The rest is made up of 15 pounds of ammo, and ammo is of course not scrappable.
---
If you're running on a team constantly executioner should be pretty good. By the time you reach the enemy your team mates have probably already popped it 1 or 2 times so you get the final heavy hitting blow.
---
They made the daily and weekly challenges more time consuming and rare (sometimes straight up impossible) so I wouldn't hold my breath about Atoms.
---
Maybe random bulked materials and caps with the chance of a random booster for exp, money or resources like Warframe does? It's a good day to keep your player base happy and engaged, just think about logging in and luckily getting a bulk of the material you need or giving you double exp for a day.
---
Honestly vendors.  WS station and Aritsan's Corner, maybe the Watoga bots after queen nukes.  It's far more likely someone will dump an unwanted weapon than you having one drop.  Farming caps and just buying what you want is maybe even more efficient.  As for spots to farm, I had good luck with the Super Mutants at nuked Harpers Ferry and AWOL Armaments at least always has a 3 star.  No guarantee of a 3 star drop, but at least a chance, I'm sure there are other events.
---
When you break it down the remainder steel is converted from mass to energy hence you don't get any tangible materials other than the same amount of lead.
---
Raider vendor bots?
---
*Flashbacks of trying to play Dark Souls on a computer without the fix*
---
Lol.  Maybe keep some spoiled meat or dirty water on you to transfer to their loot bags?
---
I don't think that is true anymore... I never find them on others kills since a few patches ago.
---
I think they were trying to make a whitesprings 2.0 type of thing, not hard to go through but nuking harpers ferry can allow you farm glowing ones and legendaries in the burrows, still not a challenge but a decent farming spot.
---
So a crafted handmade would work? Because that's all I got.
---
Energy is mass.
---
Yes, the scorchbeast‚Äôs gas attack should count as poison damage. I think the sheepsquatch (not the imposter) has a poison quill attack as well.
---
Radscorpions, Stingwings, Mirelurk Queen, Scorchbeasts, Snallygasters?
---
Xbox?
---
Does the Mothman use poison?
---
Yea, science b****!!!!
---
On xbox? I have some spare effigy. I really dont like them but i have fun with them when random people invite me. I usually block their door with one with flamingos all around them.
---
Even though grinding that event was a bit of a slog, I do miss having somewhere central to meet  a lot of other players and working as a team
---
It should do, haven't tested specifically but it reduces the buffs of all others
---
Furious exploding machine gun with vats

If you‚Äôre looking for player economy not based on reddit, it can be kinda challenging because some servers are filled with solo players and other ones have more social co-op players, the other day I got a message from a player about a flea market in whitesprings, went there and traded with about 11-12 other players and got some decent gear it was a good time. The endgame has definitely improved since launch, but is still fairly bare bones, the new free range and the encryptid events that were added this month introduced more boss fights that drop legendaries every time, and don‚Äôt require nukes to start. The burrows dungeon they added to harpers ferry isn‚Äôt anything to write home about, but nuking it does make it like whitesprings 2.0
---
those are both unarmed weapons, not single handed
---
Camps will be indestructible soon.

Spoiled meat and dirty water=emergency rations. After spending 3 weeks grinding the Springs and only eating the dead has changed my perspective on what‚Äôs edible in game.

Ok so I ctrl +f "stealth" to see if this has already been logged but didn't find anything related to what I discovered. I have my regular stealth boys set to a shortcut (in my case, 9). When I use the stealth boy from my pip boy (pressing tab, then scrolling to the stealth boy and left clicking), everything works as intended. However, when I hit the shortcut, the animation plays but the stealth boy is not used. Meaning I had 9 stealth boys in my inventory -&gt; I hit my stealth boy shortcut -&gt; the animation plays, but I still have 9 stealth boys and I am not invisible on my own screen (first as well as third person). I don't know if other players (enemies, teammates, or neutral) can see me as stealthed or not. Not game breaking but still annoying when people come to raid my workshop and I can't run circles around them invisible like a madman.
---
"Seems like something that could happen" fails to meet my high criteria of *any proof this has ever happened*. Getting disconnected won't stop anyone from recording footage. Crashes, maybe, on console definitely, but it's still easier than ever for anyone on a console to record and stream. You hit a button, there's the last hour of gameplay saved. I'm just over these threads and being brushed off like I think because it hasn't happened to me it couldn't, like I think the game is perfect and I'm some white knight, or that it's just too hard to prove it exists *but it totally does everyone!* I'm sorry if this comes off bitchy, I'm just done with rumors and stories and people acting like providing evidence is some kind of unrealistic expectation they're above because reasons.
---
Being able to craft for AA or Bloodied Swing Speed would be pretty broken.
---
No longer true.  Now you have to tag the mob.

excellent idea!
---
Does that happen to you often? I can count the number of times for me on one hand, and like I said I've never lost anything.
---
+ add some room dungeons in total dark please. So Night Eyes will be useful.
---
Totally agree!
---
Ahh of course, the vision blurring attack from radscorpions and stingwings must be poison.  
---
So the giant sloth's mushroom shake is probably one too then?
---
Or not be able to claim them..?
---
It's not the bestüòâ
---
This is fucking awesome!
---
The plans for that PA are on the terminal in Taggerty's office.
---
I did the same thing during beta.
---
I personally think there should be no fast travel at all in survival, it's way too exploitable on many levels. I love survival mode but a few tweaks could make it so much better.
---
Since repairs kits are in atom store, more and more people ask for daily and easy atom money... gj guys...

---
I‚Äôd like to see idiot savant return, but being able to craft legendary gear with a perk card seems a little over the top.
---
It‚Äôs a neat idea, but legendary items need to be left to the new and upcoming legendary vendor.
---
If u go to the terminal in the special room at fort defiance 4th floor u can unlock the plans to make it urself 
---
It might not fix the unfortunate problem of what happened but could try to remake in the long run
---
Maybe a month old if that, previously they were the weights from the exercise machine which weren't lootble.
---
I had a guy walk into my camp and tell me that he was setting up an XP farming thing and needed server slots. I said sure thing, was going to log anyhow. He keeps going on about if I don't leave in 10 seconds, he's going to destroy my camp, and would not shut up about it. Just over and over with the threats. I know he could hear me, because he replied to my initial agreement, so what the hell? I almost decided to have a seat outside and enjoy the show, then block off one more slot for the arse by hanging about and simply not fixing the camp (I could spend the 20 wood and 10 steel later, as I had nothing expensive to repair in there), but I had things to do in the real world and logged anyhow. Still regret it.
---
Is it sad I know exactly where this is?
---
I agree with you honestly. If its happen I hope it will be only "low-tiers" legendary weapons effect. It should never match with the best you can loot/buy.
---
I need to fight ticks again but feel like I was poisoned by one awhile back.
---
Or do what I do. If someone takes it, let it go. I've had exactly one workshop taken from me, and I just let it go, because there is nothing a Workshop provides that is worth the hassle for me. In truth, the only thing I take a workshop for is the ones with a fusion core generator, and even that I only need about 20 minutes of ownership to walk away with all the cores I actually need for the week. Any other resource I can gather quicker by playing than I can using a workshop.
---
Melee needs significant nerfing that's for sure.
---
Explosive modified weapons don't benefit from weapon perks?

If they were to do this kind of system, they must do it terms of consecutive days. Logging in 7 times you gets you a bonus, and not screw you out of the bonus if you missed just one single day. I **HATE** systems that do it the latter way. It's more discouraging than enticing you to play as you've already missed one day, so there's no point if that's the only reason you're logging on.
---
With how they've been scaling down the prices for many atom shop items, 10-20 atoms is too much per day. They have to make money, not throw it at you. I definitely don't agree with the absurdly difficult challenges they've been implementing though, like taking a pic of a Behemoth and a mutant hound, which is *almost* borderline impossible to do. I don't mind difficult or moderately time consuming challenges, but you can't base a DAILY challenge off pure rng or something that can take hours to set up. I also don't like challenges that 100% require another player in order to do. If they make challenges that require other players, they should be paired with a slight more difficult challenge that can be done solo, and completing one or the other will grant you atoms. For example: Take a picture of a player in a spacesuit and spacesuit helmet / Earn 300 caps from a vendor while wearing a skiing outfit and skiing hat (10 atoms).
---
Make the daily amount 5. You get 35 atoms after a week, and you get another 35 more, which is 70 total. I feel like you should get bit more after 31 consecutive days though. After a month at with 70 atoms a week, you'll earn 240 atoms from logins, so perhaps double that for 480 for 31 days.
---
No, at least according to the perk cards

I‚Äôm not sure it was ever meant to be more then a mid level dungeon. It‚Äôs a good spot to grind if you nuke it. If you kill everything above and below ground. Me and my friend nuke it and WS at the same time and hop back and forth.
---
Most redditors feel the need to post about it anytime something bad happens outside of their safe space.
---
I don't know why you are getting downvoted. The dude should have just muted and moved on. Instead he reported the player and wrote an entire post on reddit. God damn snowflakes.
---
The lobster looking mirelurks and kings both have poison.
---
I'm not sure but I don't think so, it seems to mainly use a unique sonic attack. Not sure if it's ballistic or energy damage though.
---
Depends on the effects on the 3* and also the BE can be affected by heavy gunner perks.
---
Hidden entrances to the nuclear silos.
---
Both my characters are on Acid nodes at the minute (Different ones) with my Main also having water.  My neighbour is a grumpy fellow, but easy enough to take down and frequently has interesting items on him.
---
Its where you emerge from the various nuke silos
---
Yeah, old Olney sewers was something you didn't take lightly. Used to enjoy the dart gun for dealing with deathclaws.
---
when it says non explosive heavy guns it means grenade launchers and fat mans ect not the explosive legendary.
---
that is beautiful.. Thank you! :)
---
Doesn't work for me - I've run my poor lvl 3 mule to the Valley Galeria to get one last location in Mire, but it's still bugged.
---
Reminds me of the fight between the T Rex and the Spinosaurus in Jurassic Park 3
---
Yeah, that deathclaw setup in the witches house or whatever it was called was fantastic
---
100 percent agree. I don't know why people wouldn't want to start a new character for survival. It's a great reason to start fresh.
---
Jesus bethany get something right
---
&gt; Workshops are PvP areas
---
Not how it works. The entire map is a PvP area once you claim a workshop. It is a totally broken mechanic.
---
Try the trains staton by Top of the World. I think I have seen it there.
---
Those are explosive heavy guns. 
---
The none explosives are like gatling guns/ 50 cals

I wouldn't know, couldn't bother to log in since getting into ESO last week lol. Maybe when they clean this dumpster fire of a game up and actually develop it properly i'll join the next one.
---
Juicehead has an awesome channel. He‚Äôs always tried to keep things constructive. Glade you‚Äôre back at it.
---
I'm pretty sure the owner of that reddit is banned on this reddit
---
"Utility Item".

Practically JuiceHead's vid names
---
Scary!
---
Naah I dont use it and my Mole Gauntlet made it through 3 SBQ figths. Use weapon artisian every time you repair for the 200% durability and have a decent backup weapon and you'll be fine without Makeshift Warrior (or any other degradations reducing perks) White Knight+Fix It Good for armor and the material cost is so low its irrelevant and not worth the perks on a more permanent basis...
---
There already is daily login atoms, you just have to do the objectives as well.
---
About 100 sbq fight maybe 2 or so times could not kill most times quite easy, are you on pc you can join we do lots the weekend and maybe one every night, do a silo run in round 13min
---
I‚Äôll take it!:)
---
I'm missing that location as well for the mire one, though I have all map points. I wonder if it's the same map points for everyone that dont trigger
---
This is the Correct answer.
---
It's the 900 hours guy alt account. He does that in every post for months now.
---
Great, people. Now, if just one of the blind downvoters could provide some evidence, one link? FYI: I had been using Targeting HUD for weeks on PS4, until I got consistent bluescreens every gaming session and I had to remove it. And I am still getting my enemies marked by others' T-HUDs, which was the reason for the crashes back then, the effect spreading outwards and causing overflows, so please allow me to remain cautious.
---
Did you fucking blank out bitch......really?
---
Cheers buddy, appreciate it, you got steam? Might have a game I can gift as a thank you?
---
That's somewhat how I feel about it. Most of the time when I was on survival I had to do my best simply to hide from packs of roaming griefers. Ocassionally observing them harass a poor soul who didn't fast travel away fast enough. 
---
As for what YouTube pvpers actually taught me. Pretty much have sentinel assassin/assassin unyielding armor and a rapid fire explosive weapon/god roll melee weapon.
---
I prefer the Ultracite because it's tough in terms of damage resistance and because it's unique to the game.  I won't say it's the unqualified best but I like it and through grinding and trade have got it modded the way I want.   Internal database helmet, reactive plates for torso right now, but also have the medic pump mod if I want. I had to pay someone caps to mod it with calibrated shocks. The RNG with those plans is absolutely ridiculous. I've killed over 50  queens by now probably and haven't gotten the plans once.
---
You just never tire of winning.  MMGA all the way.
---
Actually I just went you are correct they are not any longer sold..... I have the plans for the x-01 I want.. I can craft all the parts, calibrated shocks, tesla coil torso and targeting helmet.. Plans not mods.... Except, even though I have the plans, I can build everything except the targeting helmet addon for x-01... I never bought headlamp plans so idk.
---
Most of the time these guys roam in groups of 3 now.  That way if they can't 1 shot the poor victim, the other 2 can get the kill.
---
Never been able to place this successfully. A fix would be appreciated.
---
Bummer I‚Äôm to late :(
---
I think the controller should zap you like a taser, and maybe you lose like $25 cash......

This is my low-health/bloodied build. Its not for everyone, but full set of Unyielding armor and a bloodied weapon and you are one-shotting pretty much everything. You dont even have to be below 20% health to get by, but of course thats where things get interesting with Nerd Rage and Adreneal Reaction mutation (my lvl 40 Bloodied Mole Gauntlet hits for around 3k)
---
Downvote and leave sure that makes you right lol.
---
I was doing this even the other night when the Brahmin just stopped moving and wouldn't go. The timer just counted down with everyone whacking them with crooks. Most annoying.üò´
---
Haha... Yikes.
---
I got shielded raider from Uranium Fever event. Haven't yet found protective.
---
no need for bloody melee in there; hybrid melee will also 1 hit :)
---
Yep that would be totally fair for those of us not wearing the perfect set of armor and god tier weapons. ..
---
Where did you read this?
---
Pipboy should come out and punch you in the dick.
---
Theres a holotape by the post office saying the robots choose when to celebrate faschnat day. They could start it up whenever they feel.
---
No
---
What platform?
---
Lucky mole mine
---
I really hope so imagine a bloodied swing speed staff my God it would be great
---
I carry 60 just cause I love the flavor!
---
Ps4
---
Add me Psn IsoVilkku ill sell 2 nuclear keycards for 50 caps a piece?
---
I have 250+ hours in the game and not once lost anything in stash.   Yes I have dropped stuff and it disappeared with no bag.  But not the stash.
---
LOL.  You forgot to set it on fire!
---
Not just traded, someone mentioned to me that breaking them down gives you the plans to make more. So now a lot of players I'm sure have no idea that they're rocking both a helmet and a plan that shouldn't be ingame.
---
Or one
---
Oh yeah, they're little cuties arent they.
---
just something else that's bugged but at least we can ignore it
---
I‚Äôll take one
---
Was going to say this very thing.  Would be nice to have in-game weekly contests that award atoms based on that weeks winners too.   Maybe 50-100 atoms.
---
this could be what nuclear winter is
---
Yeah It would need some other tweaks to go along with it like improved damage normalisation and nerfing/removal of items that are out of balance for pvp.
---
My psn is shortyhello I‚Äôll add you tomorrow
---
I found it amusing when the bellhop said he couldn't hep me with my luggage because of union rules.
---
that is a risk, what we could do with is the introduction of level 50+ guns people always want the higher level guns so that would be one way get get some of the duped weapons out of the game and balance it
---
They dont stack. You can use the perks they share to add to your buffs. So if your points arre all spent and you want to use another perk but dont have the points to invest or the perk at all, your teammate can share it and you get to use it like its your own just by them sharing.
---
Rare drop.
---
yeah there's not really more to see there yet, to say watoga is a city it feels lacking in content
---
Huge rewards and zero risks.
---
I think yes - I've visited every marked location on the map, but 3 challenges (Mire, Bog and Toxic Valley) didn't registered. There are a lot of bugs that are still unfixed - Mire daily quests trigger once in a month after you done them first time (I can't trigger any of them for two weeks at least), some plans are still bugged (yesterday I've traded Plan: Combat Armor Dense Torso, which turns out to be Marine Dense. Sometimes I'm tired of this shit...
---
So basically if you have a few team mates and all of you have alot of melee perks... You all cam share and your melee buff would be amazing. You can have more perks than by yourselves.
---
Hope i made sense. Im high and about to pass out. Good luck. Im sure someone else will elaborate more soon ha ha.
---
This.
---
nobodys really sure yet, bethesda are really tight lipped with future content to the point that we don't know anything about stuff that's come in a couple of weeks
---
So, to clarify, your teammates get the effects of the perk for free, with no time limit or special point cost?
---
My theory is that with 5 pieces of armor each with 20% weapon weight reduction (ranged weapons only) that it would reduce their weight to 0.
---
Yup.
---
Congrats vault dweller, I hit level 100 aswell and yes I have been loving this game for the past few weeks aswell.
---
80 seems to be the current max level, players could pick and choose which server to join so those that want to help lower players still could but it would make it less likely to run into super high level players spawning enemies to high for low levels
---
Is there an aluminum equivalent?
---
I don't so I wouldn't know for a fact, but who knows, it could be true
---
That challenge is annoying, but it doesn't require you to wear an atom shop outfit. The Unstoppables outfits are five of the eligible outfits you can wear, but if you scroll down you can see there are others. Garb of Mysteries, Sleepwear, Space Suit, Western Clothes/Hat, Fasnacht Mask, Halloween Costume, Sports Attire, and Mr Fuzzy Hat all also count.
---
i must have missed that do you have a link
---
Ok
---
the end result being we keep grinding the same 3 or 4 events ovr and over, it would be nice to explore the forest and fight high level enemies there
---
Awesome. One more question. Can you only share perks you have equipped? I assume yes...
---
Yes. You got it.
---
I've gotten almost 10, its a rng location, just go there and you will find it
---
Everyone would wear only underarmor (or less), chameleon, no aid, no junk.
---
You could esentially close them all in a 4x4 dark room, that would be the same.
---
Shotgun w enforcer. Stop anything in it's track long enough for you to kill it.
---
Dont take workshops
---
Yes, make it so you cannot be PVP'd outside the workshop area and have to fast travel to defend it or lose it.
---
Auto game uninstaller when dying in Survival and account deletion.
---
Don't die!!
---
Oh, you mean Runescape wildy?
---
76 would be a good number, i have seen max level mole miners but you don't really get any variations of them so you could give them a level 70 shotgun and health to match and your ready to go
---
I‚Äôll try that next time
---
Delayed is better than cancelled, but it's still troubling when it becomes a habit (which, so far, it is) as it suggests the team is poor at setting realistic goals, either publicly or privately.
---
Most games do it. Asking for it here isn‚Äôt asking for much, especially after they‚Äôve added repair kits.
---
Sweet, well thanks for the help. Hopefully anybody searching for the answer will read this too. 
---
I‚Äôve been feeling like 15 isn‚Äôt enough for some builds... stealth+pistol for example, or basically anything with power armor. I guess perk sharing is the answer to that.
---
There is no lure.  It tells you right when claiming the workshop that it opens you to PVP.  Right up front. PVP.
---
So any PVE player who claims a PVP resource and does not expect PVP is... lacking something.
---
Ok so where do I farm acid then because you need acid to turn all that ore into lead?
---
Miner Lockers keys are for random locations - If you can't find it, change server and that mini-quest will change the location. Just go there, look for the locker with lots of stuff inside and take at least one item to register quest end.
---
I agree. I struggle to manage perks. Im constantly debating to switch points or pick a card. They need load outs for perk card set ups for doff playstyles. So you can switch them withought having to look at each one and move them one by one.
---
Yeah. Fuck that mode. 
---
Just let em kill each other and overseer can sort em out
---
It's been in my inventory for months and have never used it, T-51b FTW, overrated.
---
Think it was only 90k ammo. I‚Äôve made 70k over the last 4-5 days and have the mats for another 200k. .50 cal, same as him. It‚Äôs not that hard to do. There were a lot of people suspicious over why he was banned because the ammo that he had wasn‚Äôt actually that crazy.
---
I've found the winning tactic at this event is having 3 points in First Aid and a cryolator. Also points in Field Surgeon are a bonus. You can easily hold all 3 pylons and make the imposter really easy to deal with this way. It's even doable at lower levels ( have a video incase anyone else starts ranting about this claim ). Plus cryocorpses are really easy to locate. 
---
Funnily enough the only char I've had trouble at this event with is my commando who is all damage/no survival and keeps getting stuck at events where noone else will conduit. I've tried but no First Aid and VATs dependence don't work so well.
---
 You can get acid from The Flatwoods Monster, The Mothman and Wendigos. Just to name a few. ;)
---
Exactly. People who like the game are busy playing it, not posting about it.
---
Says video not available so I haven't a clue. I have had weapons stop doing damage and vats not working. All until I switch weapons and then back again. In survival mode I've hit people and it takes the server a sec to register also.
---
When you dropped the set, did you not care to look at it? Or do you mean you scrapped it blindly? Anyway, don't fret, I hardly ever see anyone using ultracite PA, and that must be for a reason (iirc, repair costs make it a bad choice), and if you pick up the plans, you can build your own later.
---
My main thought is that the "re-roll" needs to exponentially more expensive
---
Re-roll a 1\* - 1 Token
---
Re-roll a 2\* - 2 Tokens, per ability Re-roll (So 4 token to re-roll the whole item)
---
Re-roll a 3\* - 3 Tokens, per ability Re-roll (So 9 token to re-roll the whole item)
---
This will also mean, more grinding, more playing, but allow the 1\*'s to be of actual use.
---
But wouldn‚Äôt just scrapping guns for lead and steel be a lot easier
---
"Yeah. Fuck that mode. Just let em kill each other and overseer can sort em out"
---
That just made my day! :)
---
I always share stranger in numbers with my brother and pretend I am apocalypse from X-Men lol
---
Interesting; I had the same issue with building the targeting attachment, so at least you know it isn‚Äôt just you...
---
yeah that's not a very balanced fight low level and new players coming back to the game are at a stronge disadvantage because there are so many very high level players running around
---
They should of made the knight one green like the one in Fallout 4. Then you would have orange, black, and green.
---
Its called Fastnacht and not faschnacht or Fasnacht.
---
Maybe it's just some :(. I know a few became discovered with my mule then got the challenge
---
that girl is poison
---
if they some something like that set they might think twice about attacking, they prefer to attack easy targets
---
If you install the drum mod on that your ammo (per drum) would somewhere around 300 rounds.
---
ok thanks
---
Reminds me of Karl Pilkington.
---
I mean there are plenty of survival games that use this mechanic, you don't like it?
---
Same, though I'm missing some parts to complete 3 suits. I have a frame for each.
---
i‚Äôve got a lvl 50** AGL that‚Äôs +30 dmg to super mutants if you‚Äôre interested. i never use the agl unless i accidentally pick up a bunch of ammo.
---
Are you talking about Rage Chronicles? Or Lore Spade?
---
Yeah it would be a risk/reward dynamic, I think it would add a lot. I don't think people would take nothing with them but you would be very careful about using valuable gear.
---
I hid in that hole for 3 hours on survival and stayed at the top of the leaderboard for quite a while.
---
So I need to farm acid farm lead ore then craft lead then farm gunpowder and steel. Or just skip half that crap and scrap guns. Wouldn‚Äôt this be easier or am I wrong.
---
&gt;I believe you can add calibrated shocks to both legs of the Ultracite PA
---
You can, but the plans for them a SBQ drops only I understand.
---
Also, it explodes shortly after dying.
---
I've never played Runescape but I've played a few perma death survival games which I really enjoyed. I think it would be amazing in the fallout world. How is RuneScape wildy?
---
It's just a video game.  I understand there will be disappointment, but at the end of the day, people will be people.  I wish you luck in the future.
---
LOL yeah. They will eventually find it any how. ;P
---
Fuuuuuuck this needs way more formatting. Just slabs of text all bleeding together. I'll try read it after a few coffees.
---
The stored resources should be awarded. If you don't get a chance to claim your lead you saved up you should get it when logging in again.
---
I am against that; FO76 needs revenue.
---
You share one at a time. It'll stay shared continuously. I share travelling pharmacy with my mate, works a treat.
---
&gt; Turns out the camera helps find the corpse as its name appears in the viewfinder when the camera is pointed at it.
---
Thanks for that bit of info.
---
I just get on mic and start yelling at people, it usually works and we get it done. Squeeky wheel gets the grease!
---
&gt;¬∑ 2 hours ago  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;The state of the game is that this question and ‚Äúshould I come back‚Äù are asked dozens of times a day here.
---
guy?
---
Hemlock holes workshop. Triple acid extractors. Job done.
---
Well, they don't always disappear. They most of the time just drop back at the spot where they spawned. If you are lucky is right nearby. Always do a quick search of the immediate area. They didn't spawn too far away from where you killed them most of the time. I have been able to find several that popped out of existence on me. Most recently one in the burrows I found in the next room, at the foot of a bed halfway sticking out of the wall.
---
I am having a lot of fun playing F76.
---
I doubt it‚Äôll be that long before we see Fasnacht again. It was received *really* well. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it made another appearance after the current slate of events this year.
---
This is a couple patches old, maybe even a launch bug.
---
WWR armor is the only one that seems to stack when using perk cards and armor together. JWR, AWR and FCDWR all seem to bug out if you have the related perks equipped.
---
I enjoy it for testing out builds, gear, and strategy. Plus more often than not I get at least a 2 star item. Although on a few occasions I haven't been able to find the body (I know the camera trick now though).
---
I have had it happen just 3 or 4 times in hundreds of hours, and all my stuff was there each time when I came back. I agree on the user error.
---
It usually happens to me when I charge up to enemies and hit them right away, I have to pause for a second before hitting them or else 50% of the time it does no damage. My guess is it's a server latency issue, but yes very annoying.
---
I havn‚Äôt been on in about a week, so it may‚Äôve been another member of our cult- uhh..church
---
Well, technically we on PC don't have it either. Just those who got it from the dev room or knew someone who did. It's not available to the rest of us either. They need to just put it in game legit on all platforms.
---
&gt; How's the game? Worth coming back?
---
Those posts weren't removed if they weren't low-effort 
---
&gt; How's the game? Worth coming back? **Still trash, right?**
---
Trolls were always dealt with.
---
Well, I expect that boarded up door will open up. As far as the area below, it is curious but probably won't lead to anything.
---
I'm more of a T-60 guy because it's maintenance is so damn easy.. Also the Queen dropped me a jetpack plan so it has that going for it.
---
I'm sure it's updated to allow variances now, but when I played you kept your 3 rarest/valuable items on death and everything else was dropped to the victor. 
---
So your entire armor set-up, including weapon, is 8ish items by itself and then you drop everything in your 20 or 24 item slot backpack, which includes your food, quest items, spell casting runes, back up equipment, money, collectibles, all gone if you're carrying them.
---
And whatever they don't loot becomes fair game to the world in X amount of minutes.
---
+300 under the right circumstances ;-)
---
Have you named them for easy sorting/ finding?
---
Well said.
---
Both have pros and cons. If you went melee I would suggest assassin cavalier armor. You most likely will get vat crits to the dome if not using stealth boys. Up until you closed the distance and shred them. I use sentinal assassin with my commando and still do well. Watch RageChronicles on youtube and you will see the good and the bad of pure builds. Goodluck out there.
---
Missed the pinned post then?
---
You know who you are.
---
That was a nice drop, was it made of wood?
---
My zealot's auto grenade launcher with some of the damage boosting perks does drop the SBQ's health at a decent rate. A buff would be nice though.
---
His sub is banned for him refusing to follow Rule 5, and he is banned for spreading slander and lies about myself and another moderator on multiple Discord servers.

Yes, you can direct people there. Just DM them.

It‚Äôs spelled Fasnacht in-game, whether that‚Äôs the correct spelling is on Bethesda.

Due to issues with a popular trading subreddit, we made the conscious decision to not affiliate ourselves with, or even imply affiliation with, any trading subreddits. A google search turns up several. It's inconvenient, but alas.
---
I'm going to take a wild stab in the dark that you're way over your stash/weight limit.
---
There is a minimum karma threshold, along with an account age threshold. I'll forward this to the others to consider adjusting.

I believe her Reddit tag is Veingloria. She hosts a series of events, originally dubbed flatwoods farmers markets, on pc. Usually on Sunday afternoons but sometimes on weekday evenings. She gave a tour of Fort Defiance, and recently one about the real life area where the prison is.
---
They should make it permadeath. Also they shouldn't tell people they done it just to make it interesting.
---
I wish it was that easy, usually theres like 1-2 easy challenges MAX. The rest are a joke. Level 3 times in weird tedious ways ex; "level up using camera" or some bs like that. Also the god awful Brewing missions from before, now its the stupid camera. I hate these annoying challenges that try to give players incentive to use the stuff bethesda adds into the game.
---
I don't wanna use the camera. Nobody wore the beerhat. Nobody wants to brew every drink in the game for 10 atoms -\_-
---
My only experience with someone roleplaying a raider went the opposite of this. Someone ran up to me in ritual gear and started hitting me with their melee weapon hoping for me to engage. I role-play as a pastor so I didn‚Äôt engage him, but I responded using the scared ‚Äúhelp‚Äù emote once and then spammed the heart emote and gave him some wine, a burnt book, and a Prayer (A note you can find in the church in the mire.) He gave me something back (I forget what) and then helped me kill some nearby scorched that were too high level for me. He could have easily let them kill me, but he helped an old holy man out.
---
The cost should be lowered significantly and/or the cooldown removed. With the cooldown removed when a good group is assembled people could bring it multiple times and have a group actually be ready for it.  Then you might see some large-group behaviors.
---
I got in a fight the other day caught outside of my PA and was super surprised by this. I've used PA from the start in 76 and also 4 so it really threw me off
---
Was there a drill or syringer? Those are on the legendary loot roll still.
---
heh I usually do this as well, however I'm running around as the Silver Shroud/Mysterious Stranger and as soon as someone either starts to struggle slightly with a hard monster I run in (after they've hit it!) and just _PAM_ punch it till' it's dead and run off + fast travel as quickly as I can :P
---
I believe you‚Äôre forced to destroy items if your 1,500 lbs over your characters carry weight.
---
Lead is pretty common tbh
---
no no weapons are armor at all just some 308. ammo, not even a hunting rifle that i could have broken down for the steel
---
Wikipedia says that "Fasnacht" is also correct. It sounds stupid though.
---
I had this probkem with the event sheepsquatch.  Sometimes its name becomes legendary after death,sometimes it just has no legendary loot.
---
I did a couple WS nukes over the weekend and everytime there was a lot of Rhododendron that didnt get the nuked effect (was especially around the clubhouse where you can get a lot fast and easy) I usually get around 350-400 fluorescent when placing the nuke myself but this weekend a "good" run gave 150-200... (farming for mutation serums to vendor)
---
Game breaking no, annoying yes very much!
---
It was nice to be sure, but I felt a little priced into grinding out levels personally.
---
Still, i got a fresh alt to 50, my mule up some levels for the weight perks i forgot originally, and like a dozen levels on my main.
---
Ah right. Sucks but I've had that happen too. Legendary drops are still a bit of a mess. Last night I got multiple ghouls drop 2 at a time. They were all shit, if it makes you feel any better.
---
Lol i got banned for being with a duper and because they banned me really late and i still had about 10k items and i got banned and they sent me an email saying that when they found a future/upcoming patch they will unban me, its now been since january 4th or so and i have been banned  ever since and i think that they have no intention to unban me, what do i do lol
---
They did this as an antiduping measure.  If you are vastly overweight you have to destroy items until you hit a certain weight threshold.   You can still be very heavy without this triggering.
---
I'd love to play full loot drop version of this game but suggested approach is ridiculously bad. For full loot drop not to be terrible idea, we'd need a gamemode where there is no legendary weapons nor armor.
---
BOI!
---
That probably goes a bit far for me but I would like perma death as an optional toggle.
---
whitesprings would probably be your closest and safest choice as they offer all the workbenchs and you won't be attacked by passing enemies
---
I am reluctant to share this due to the already significant frequency my CAMP conflicts with other CAMPs, but it is not my work. 
---

I only know how its spelled in German language, but i guess in english its called Fasnacht without a "t" after the "s" ;) weird.
---
why not both?
---
Considering the bugs and glitches, would you risk your gear because you get stuck and someone can freely slowly kill you with a chainsaw?
---
scraping unwanted ammo for lead and steel would be a nice touch
---
Yeah I think you are probably right. I think I would actually make the game a lot better, I feel the legendary stuff is pretty ott.
---
It did get fixed, the vendor restocked, but it actually took a couple days to restock. Back to normal now.
---
it would and that's why it hasn't been added yet
---
shielded lining (best, tier 3) is a drop from the uranium fever event.
---
i don't know the names of the other lining but before you get tier 2 you have to buy tier 1 from a raider vendor and then wait for his stock to update.
---
most legendary drops seem to be 1* anyway it's just that i was fight a 3* you wonder what they might have had
---
If that griefer goes workshop-PvPing they get vulnerable to PvP.
---
Pretty sure the Grafton Monster does too. The black blobs it shoots.
---
yeah it seems to be another broken system
---
Guns aren‚Äôt made with lead. They‚Äôre made with steel, wood and other components. While I‚Äôm all for getting screws and springs from guns‚Äîthey‚Äôre made with them‚Äîlead doesn‚Äôt make any sense. 
---
The component grind is part of the game, for better or worse. The only way around it is to buy ammo from players‚Äîwhich is easy enough to do. 
---
If you‚Äôre going to do it the hard way: 
---
Lucky Hole Mine is the place to get lead ore, use an excavator suit to double your haul. One run through will get you enough for a week, easily. 
---
Take Hemlock Holes and stockpile acid for smelting.
---
Take Grafton Steel for steel &amp; lead extractors. The Super Mutants there also drop lots of weapons to scrap, caps and the gunpowder you‚Äôll need. 
---
Find a lead deposit and build your CAMP there. They produce ready to use lead. 
---
If/when you‚Äôre XP grinding, go to Watoga and kill robots. They drop lead and steel, so basically they pay for their own bullets.
---
Get on party with people that can share lvl 3 Travelling Pharmacy, Pack Rat and Thru-Hiker if you don't have them yourself.
---
That is just an example of perks that mitigate the issue so you can eat and drink. Pick and choose as appropriate depending on what you want to save. Once you are below 1500lbs + you toon's carry weight you will be able to function.
---
If you die your junk - no, not that one :P - will be unceremoniously destroyed.
---
All of it.
---
People can still feed you/hydrate you with the relevant charisma perk while you get yourself sorted.
---
The key here is do not log in until you have the logistics sorted.
---
You have a small window of opportunity to do so before the game does it for you whether you like it or not.
---
I've never been fully stuck like that but I don't think that is too much of an issue personally.
---
Happens sometimes bud, annoying but nothing you can do unfortunately. Bodies seem to be disappearing again for me at the moment a lot to boot
---
Nope I'm ps4 bit thank you. I've done about that myself. I've had s couple that I've lost knowing I'm going to. Like when someone else drops one and there's like 5 level 30s in excavator armor. But this weekend there is no reason we shouldn't have been able to to it. We had about 10 people with like 2 level 70s the rest were level 150 +. We never even got her health low enough to regenerate.
---
The inside to outside electricity already exists. Go buy the advanced connectors plan. I think it's in enclave bunker. It has several connector types to allow you to pass electricity between walls and/or roof.
---
Many are having problems with Grafton Dam too.
---
I tried the trick with new characters and it worked to a small degree. I had a quest go from 2/5 to 4/5 but two new characters haven't been able to complete it. I'm afraid I'll run out of characters to fix that last location on those last regions.
---
I found a Fasnacht Mask lying around in the assylum
---
They can drop from the Encryptid event.
---
I have spent all my points on pistols and explosives and I have zero perks for melee, and yet melee is by far the strongest and only viable option for me is just absurd. I was patient and willing to wait but they are spending all their time on new content and it looks like they aren't doing anything about this. have they said anything at all about this??
---
That's an odd ball.
---
Yeah I think Fallout 76 is way too easy. I'm doing a bloodied stealth commando build and it is fuggin' OP; i mean, I can take down a scorchbeast in 6 shots with my bloodied handmade rifle even though the bloodied handmade rifle is level 35. I think that Bethesda should add the following into a new hardcore mode:
---
‚Ä¢ Enemies gain 50% more health
---
‚Ä¢ Enemies gain 20% more armor
---
‚Ä¢ Enemies deal 25% more damage
---
‚Ä¢ Enemies are able to use chems (such as stimpaks and psycho)
---
‚Ä¢ Enemies are able to use the legendary weapons that they drop (e.g. legendary super mutant drop is explosive shotgun - he can use the explosive shotgun against you while alive)
---
‚Ä¢ Certain enemies ignore 25% of your armor
---
‚Ä¢ Some enemies ignore specific damage reduction perks you currently have equipped (e.g. refractor, blocker, etc.)
---
‚Ä¢ You must find different types of disease cure to cure different types of diseases like in Fallout 4 Survival (e.g. parasites disease cure - herbal anodyne, etc.)
---
It'll end up on the Atom Shop.
---
Huh so that patch rebalancing the mass and fluid to make it "easier" to get actually did the opposite then.... Well shit...
---
Energy is not mass,they are distinctly different. However energy is equal to mass (√ó ^c)
---
https://study.com/academy/lesson/mass-and-energy-description-and-interchangeable-relationship.html
---
It's difficult finding enough enemies to keep the infinite stack going however...
---
Whoopsie can be contracted from Mirelurk hatchlings.
---
100% agreed.
---
Considering those plans and masks no longer drop (until maybe the next year), selling them for like 2K is poor business. There is a **very limited number of those around**. And people want them.
---
I am so waiting for player vending machines to sell all of that later this year.
---
I mostly stopped playing overwatch for this game
---
Well i mean they did already nam refridgerators and a "Access your stash anywhere"-item in the "We wanted to try something new for the Atom-Shop" post a while back so... yeah, that'll be coming, pretty sure.
---
Those challenges are broken since Beta and Bethesda isn't even fixing them anymore. I guess they think that people buy more Atoms with real money when they make it so that you can't earn Atoms from game anymore.
---
yeah, in 76 they could go one step further and actually add new functions and visual changes to the revisions, new mods and such too.
---
I saw a ghoul that started jacking off after he died in the first day that I started playing this game. Instant 5/5 review.
---
Pretty sure it was.
---
Lumbago day
---
Thanks! I didn‚Äôt know it  was just a random location, I never really bothered to look at the quest previously and spent all this time on one server being frustrated! lol
---
Thanks! I didn‚Äôt realize it was just rng and you could do it more than once.
---
Agreed saw it lose to a legendary scorpion.
---
I like your attitude, because you could have sell it but you give it away for free. Thanks Mate...
---
Lifting weight‚Äôs are not made of lead there made with cast iron. Yet lead comes from them in this game. You make absolutely no sense. Not only that but you said one run will last you a week, this is def not true for heavy guns at all. More like 2-3 hours.
---
I‚Äôm running a pistol build right now and it‚Äôs working pretty well. 
---
As well as a broadsider build. Damage is good only complaint is the lack of cannonballs.
---
Well, yes and no. It seems like the enemies that you tag drop those materials in much larger numbers than they used to, so as long as you're reasonably aggressive you shouldn't have any shortage, for the most part. 
---
Oddly enough, I *have* noticed that whereas I always found myself very short on hardened masses while I had big surpluses of glowing masses and high-radiation fluids, it's now always high-radiation fluids that I run out of first.
---
You probably think it's fine because you don't have a proper build. If you think a bloodied melee build is the best, then you are absolutely wrong - a bloodied stealth commando build is the best because you can also attack ranged enemies such as scorchbeast when they're flying high in the air
---
WTF!!!! It's real??????? PD: That mothman statue looks very cool!!!! I would like to have one like this on my house xddd, someday I will go there to visit that museum, it would be great
---
You just need someone to carry you on westek, kill every super mutant, then go to the nearby placement, kill every supermutant... Start, finish, repeat. And boom ur lvl 71 and skipped all the boring leveling.
---
The OP put some work into it. Having read that will put reader in a better position that not knowing anything, despite some extreme errors being there. You know what can't be meta? Anti armor explosive shotgun. Anti armor halves ballistic damage resistance. Explosive damage is not ballistic damage. AAE is basically just an explosive with empty prefix slot. This shit can't be meta. Firerate, on the other hand, is still commonly neglected, but is one of best rolls just as OP said.
---
For Maude is the name of the holotape. Nothing important there, but it adds a tiny bit to the story of burrows
---
Meta only matters to people that worry about what everyone else is doing, in true monkey see monkey do fashion.
---
Again, most of the serious pvpers 1 shot kill, you wont &amp; dont have time to repair in majority of the player encounters.
---
I spend MAJORITY of my time in Survival. 
---
Just because some nerds on reddit are not playing survival &amp; are crying about repair kits, THAT THEY CAN GET FOR FREE from the SBQ,  doesn‚Äôt mean that no one at all is playing it.
---
The Survival servers seem to always be populated, EVERY DAY, since I literally play at least 6 hours a day &amp; spend majority of my tine there, I‚Äôm speaking from first hand experience whereas you seem to just be repeating drivel you read on reddit.
---
I think it‚Äôs you who doesnt know what you are talking about. 
---
There is no imaginary p2w advantage if you take your crybaby ass to adventure mode, farm the SBQ &amp; get the BETTER repair kit FOR FREE, &amp; the go back to Survival.
---
Yup but still a solution.

The other day I found 2 guys inside a camp. So I sneaked up to the windows, took all my clothes off, then stood up and opened the shutters... The reaction of them stopping what they were doing and looking at me was hilarious on its own.
---
I then closed the shutters, ran into some bushes and crouched (chameleon), they came out looking for me :-)
---
It is probably because of lag. Sometimes when clicking on one item, the inventory jumps to another item after you have pressed the button. I accidentally bought a marsupial recipe this way off of another player when i was trying to buy a different recipe. The item selected jumped positions after i pressed to select it. It was the best mistake though, ive made my money back many times over and found a use for all that crimson flux.  :)
---

---
My choice would be explosive with faster fire rate, it's not very good in vats, but devastating if you aim it. 
---
I have a BE vats gatlin &amp; it's the best weapon I own. I would only part for a reduced weight or faster fire rate option, otherwise it's never for sale/trade. 
---
But I think I watched too many western as a kid as I feel the same about my BE Lever action.
---
I visited Helvetia over the weekend. Bethesda pretty much nailed the accuracy of the place.
---
It's not a bad design or anything, but I actually find it to be less visually-interesting than the default skin. Literally the only difference is that anything that isn't silvery metal is replaced by dark grey. I might eventually buy it just for completionist's sake if it weren't a limited time offer, but I'm not rushing out to get it at this point.
---
Yeah I haven't played in literally months and months, my computer was broken. I have 400 in my stash and 3000+ on me in weight, and since I last played, none of my friends are playing the game anymore either. I'm by myself. I'm not really sure what to do.
---
Or team up with someone who loves to build.
---
wtf people are actually still playing this.  when are you going to realize it will take everyone abandoning it before they truly take time to fix anything and stop the greedy money hungry bs and dishonest anticonsumer crap. and focus on making it a quality game and not a buggy mess and the laughing stock of gamers for our generation and probaly next 2 to come
---
I'd do anything to look like Doc Holiday. Sadly they don't have schofields in this game
---
400h testing across four months.
---
My main tip: dont assume you understand this game completely. I assume I don't, its way too complicated to be researched in fully.
---
Judging by the fact there's no "neglected godrolls" subsection of this post there are still things yoy haven't tested that are awesome.
---
So does my three years old daughter play Fallout behind my back, because she gives me thumbs up all the time? Hmmm, it can't be good for her(I mean thumbs up, Fallout is good for everyone).
---
I'm 3000+ weight. I'm not really sure what to do.
---
Missile Launcher works well. I have a Bloodied one, with demolition expert bloody mess and stabilized it only take a few missile to kill a 68 super mutant. It does what it‚Äôs supposed to, it‚Äôs not a one hit kill. It never was.
---
Trust me, I know it sucks, but Rule #9. The best thing you can do is report it to Bethesda. All posts like this get removed. It's noble, but a waste of time.
---
you can do what the mechanic encourages you to do, destroy items until you are not extremely overencumbered.
---
or you could try lumbering around with that weight and level up to get weight reduction perks, but that alone might not get you low enough....
---
i've getting that as well plus i have had non robot bodies exploding which is just weird, the mole miner must have had the last laugh perk
---
I wonder if they'll have fixed the drop rates by then :/
---
u have a bloodied build. im talking standard. still takes 3-4 missiles for 1 super mutant. with max perks. thats insane
---
Huh, interesting, thanks
---
Start over.
---
Some of the challenges are even broken and you can't finish them. I don't think that Bethesda wants to even fix these.
---
i bet you are using a revolver. the only pistol that does any damage
---
I just noticed this last night
---
Yes, this has been happening a lot lately. The body completely vanishes within seconds of getting the kill.
---
Its a yearly thing. Cant chase away winter spirits in august
---
Not quite my experience of this weekend. There were several people one-shotting ghouls in a Whitesprings nuke-zone. Some people were actively blocking us from tagging ghouls and when a friend dropped low level legendary items for my lvl 25-30 alt in the Golfclub a lvl 87 player went between us and pushed us aside to loot the bag my team mate dropped. When confronted on voice he answered by making silly noices ridiculing me. Yes it was stupid of us to drop stuff instead of using the trading system, but after having dropped the trade twice this would have been easier. 
---
Some parts of the Fallout PC-community are really toxic assholes.
---
Furious with Swing Speed works like a charm
---
We need this^^
---
How do you mean?
---
You have to talk to biv at the tattoo parlor and you may have to spamthe talk button to get him to give you a quest and the camera is a random spawn easiest way is to find someone on here advertising tourist to get it.
---
If I destroyed every consumable I have, I'd still be hungry / thirsty, and over 2500+.
---
And when the legendary vendor appears. I want my stash space back
---
yes we do
---
Wait what
---
then maybe most of your weight is used by items in other categories?... my guess is that it's weapons and armor, i doubt it's junk but that's also a possibility
---
I do this at range. Follow people and snipe the stuff they‚Äôve tagged, or ghouls charging at them, so the corpses rag doll towards them. 
---
Prettymuch all I do on my sniper now.
---
Both honestly and a few others I can't remember the names of. Its all the same though, really.
---
This is how o communicate with my lads when I'm on headset. We have a laugh with it
---
They should get a tesla or stay away from events. With a tesla, sitting on the scaffolding inside, they could avoid melee and still not one-shot everything. It's just a question of being a selfish asshole or not. The are.
---
My shotty burns through shells. Id love to be able to scrap 5.56 ammo. It just adds up and up till its dumped. While we're at it a bit more personal stash weight would be lovely.
---
heck off
---
Mainly, yeah. All my junk is stored in my stash. How many mules does Bethesda expect you to make? For fuck sakes...
---
Thanks! I spoke to the robot but I only tried it once. I'll go back.
---
Time will tell how ingenuitive the raider choke points become. Fo 76 is not a sandbox survival simulator that you seem to want. More power to you if Beth listens but I hope they don't because it'll just continue to neuter the game. 
---
 Dude, as long as you attempt to "accidentally" build your camp anywhere near a spawn zone then it  will get leveled. Period. Learn from your experience OR continue to complain that the "griefers" keep re-teaching you.
---
 Amazing that I've been playing since launch and have NEVER had my camp razed with your frequency. It absolutely couldn't be something that you're doing
---
Have you done the nukashine quest that activates from reading the party flyer?
---
well, Bethesda expects you to not hold on to every single piece you find. normal armor can be crafted later, so why not scrap it when you need space now. most legendaries are not good enough to keep, so beth expects you to vendor or trade the ones you dont use
---
...or any staircase looking like it fits with the brick building set. There are some corner stairs in enclosed wood that is just one large square that I have seen in FO4 at least. It would fit perfectly.
---
Heh, I remember that.  Just starting out.  "hmm, do I go left or right right off the bat."
---
TURN BACK DON'T GO RIGHT!
---
I'm a trader, not an adventurer. I *am* the vendor.
---
Yeah meanwhile i am still searching for an alien as well..
---
I've killed mobs directly on their spawn and they vanish completely before I can loot the legendary. This has been occurring since around patch 7 when Bethesda started tinkering around with the respawn.   
---
Patch 7 note:
---
* **Respawn:** Approaching the corpse of an enemy that was killed at long distance no longer occasionally causes the corpse to disappear and the enemy to immediately respawn.  
---
Perhaps players entering the map cell of the mob you've killed is creating issues with the corpse? In Whitespings it occurs a lot more often for me than anywhere else on the map and it has a higher concentration of players so could increase that chance if it's the case.

---
I rev my chainsaw instead
---
Was it worth it?
---
If is gear you are going to make some tough choices as in what to keep and what to throw away.
---
Thing is you can still salvage 400lbs of stuff by just dumping it in your stash but as you have probably noticed by now it won't let you do it until you have 'slimmed down'.
---
Depending on the gear I might be able to help but only to am extent, gear weight reduction perks are not as generous as junk/consumables. Is 50-60% (and rifles you are SoL, there aren't any even though my modded Handmade weighs as much as my Gatling) as opposed to 90%.
---
Yes.
---
It's futher back than you think, there is a Crab on the bridge. If you are EU time zone and xbox I can help later
---
Use the bunker in the background under the bridge as your guide
---
this makes me like the game even more.
---
Omg yes I loved that event.
---
Use this!
---
That just makes you a gullible idiot adding to problem and making it take longer before it fixed properly
---
Erm... perhaps I need to ask you do u need any pipe weapons and silver forks üòÇ
---
Joking aside...got some t45 plans, camp plans, couple of assault rifles and misc junk.  Might have been quite useful 50 odd levels ago.  13 plans in total 8 were already known.
---
Can‚Äôt wait...
---
I had this happen as well. Quitting to desktop and coming back fixes it.
---
Ah. Best thing I ever got from a treasure map was a Tesla rifle and Deep Pocketed robot armor limbs for the extra carry weight. I always wait until I get about 10 maps, then I go treasure hunting for a few hours
---
even NPC vendors dont carry as much as you though....
---
i also like to trade, check my reddit post history and you'll see the vast majority of it is spent trading.... but figuring out if your supply has demand is a crucial part of being a trader.
---
keeping a random assault rifle a supermutant dropped is not worth the inventory space it takes nor the time to scroll past it in your inventory, plans exist in this game exactly so you wont have to keep every variant of every drop you find
---
To be honest it'd be nice if the rewards scaled with your level or somewhere vaguely near it.its another 'bethesda is having a laugh at our expense' type things .
---
10 is my magic number as well, just put this one off for a bit cos I knew it was a pain in the nads
---
I tend to take a few shots at the Sheepsquatch when he spawns, to make sure I get loot, and then hang around the brahmin so that if someone starts attacking them, I can turn attention right away to protecting them.
---
Thanks chap, sorted it by turning the grass off üòÇ
---
I got 3 lvl 100 1 50 and the 48
---
The air guitar over a fallen enemy is hot. I gotta give it to some of the photographers on this sub.
---
Looks like a blues brother
---
No worries, for Me Savage Divide #7 was the Pita
---
Not sure if it's intentional but just like a real drunk it's hard to get a straight response off him. Just keep bugging him to a quest pops up.
---
The Diablo 3 legendary reroll system. Reroll one effect all the times you want, but only one effect can be chosen on each item and will thereafter be "locked" And hope they make it like item with Atom-shop mods, no trade/drop/sell on a modified legendary
---
Doubt they will let us just outright chose the effect
---
Christ, I‚Äôve got 6 of that one üòÇ. Only got got to the find the fecker once and then I‚Äôll get the ruler out on the monitor and take measurements üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Man I love reddit I just come here for the comments really
---
The event is literally only good now to get massive amounts of junk from idiots who bring what looks their entire stash of junk to the event for some reason. Someone died with 800lbs+ of junk the other day, including a fuck ton of different flux.
---
I have 2x Gladiator and I keep one hitting everything in my path with a spiked ski sword, really OP.
---
But if someone uses Adrenalin, which is probably every gamer in this game they can get the same amount of damage? You can trade your weapons for whatever price you like :x? There is no restriction or plausible logical explanation for high prices on weapons :x People are just doing it and some are buying it. \*shrug\*
---
I use a vamp auto handmade and can usually hold 2 pilons without loosing health if I keep shooting at mobs.
---
Raiders are mostly described in a later time a hundred years after the bombs fell. Then they're kind of cowards who prey on helpless settlers and who would never attack anyone with power. If they attract attention of one of the more powerful organisations they would get stamped out.
---
In Fallout 76 a raider would be a vault dweller that went nuts and attacked their former friends. I would think that they would also need to keep a low profile or be killed by other vault dwellers teaming up to stamp them out.
---
I wonder how much thought people actually put into their character's background and motivations when claiming to roleplay. I come from pen and paper roleplaying games and do think about these things, and I don't call myself a roleplayer in the game as not all my comments are in character. I do wish there would be an actual roleplaying immersive mode to play in but that would have to be completely free from legendaries to have a chance of being immersive.
---
Thanks!
---
Wade Airport workshop has oil extractors, if that's of any help?
---
I like to find my way into locked CAMPs.  Usually by using Marsupial and jumping to a window and activating a workbench to get inside.
---
I don't actually do anything in there except drop a Propaganda Flyer at the inside entrance.
---
Then I just leave.  I'm sure it freaks some players out wondering:
---
- How the hell I got past their locked door without becoming Wanted
---
- Who the hell is leaving Propaganda Flyers
---
I always take them from the bots so I have a lot on me at all times.
---
They are pretty obtainable if you cruise the market.  I think I grabbed up the 8 I was concerned about for 5k all in all.  Was bumping up against the cap limit so couldn't see a downside.
---
I threw 3 plasma and 8 frag grenades to the SBQ the other day, the server was fine for the few hours I was on it afterwards.
---
‚ÄúLet them fight.‚Äù
---
I always took this occurrence as grazing (melee). Enemies move around while we are dancing around dodging trying to not die too. 
---
Could be the same with guns but idk.
---
It's so funny that all the raider always say the same thing in Fallout 4. There are a few funny conversations about that guy immitating noices, though.
---
exits*
---
I wish though would be a nice shortcut.
---
Two tips
---
1, Take Power Armour, it's easier to get to it from above. Or Marsupial, as the rocks that look like steps are too big
---
2, The angle on the pylons isn't correct.
---
It‚Äôs how a lot of people who are weak/small or feel insignificant in real life deal with their feelings. They feel tough by pretending to be tough online. It‚Äôs called a Napoleon complex, or ‚Äúlittle man syndrome‚Äù. Just ignore it and move on knowing they‚Äôll get hit by a truckload of karma at some point.
---
Thanks chap....might have a bash at it as I‚Äôm in the area
---
Only if you do the SBQ regularly.
---
Regular SBs go down with regular 5mm ammo just fine.
---
Besides the gatling is excellent for ammo management and the 5mm ammo common enough that is entirely possible to never ever craft a single round.
---
Conversely crafting ultracite ammo is a chore that gets old fast and the fire rate of the prime receiver is lower than the regular ammo 'speedy' version.
---
&gt;bethesda is having a laugh at our expense
---
That would never happen, BGS are our gods.
---
I have many full suits of wood armor and hundreds of rolling pins to prove it.
---
And now all I can think is "The griefers are easily startled, but they'll soon be back, and in greater numbers."
---
Don't forget the legendary pool cues
---
I hate that ability to just stand in the way of everything. I think that the butttons inteacting with players should be separate and not replace the normal action buttons. I still want to be able t jump and open doors even when someone stands close to me.
---
Well, at least he actually wore the raider PA. Half a point for roleplay... Minus ten for griefing.
---
You're not wrong.
---
I remember someone making up a chart showing which ammo benefited from the ultracite upgrade.  5mm had the lowest increase in damage and the upgrade was not worth it.  Conversely,  .50 cal had I believe one the highest changes in DPM and the upgrade was worth the trouble. I would leave the 5mm just as it is. Hope this helps.
---
I tried once to find the treasure at the downed space station, spent way too long, never again. I dumped all the maps and never pick them up, my stash still overflows with crap, no need for 'treasure' map garbage.
---
I've seen this happen at watoga after the sbq
---
I‚Äôm about an hour away from logging back in, gotta sleep sometime.
---
Golden gun paint was a limited time offer and it returned for a second run. All of these limited time sale items will make their way back into rotation to buy again. 
---
The McRib is back for a limited time!
---
True raiders reuse the standard raider lines, use pipe weapons raider amour and are easy to take down
---
Off the meds again, I see.
---
We definitely need another one I went from 40 to 52 this weekend. Dope !
---
Why shouldn't be we be able to trade it
---
They might have genuinely thought you were cheating. Maybe they were lagging and that made them suspicious. A false report is not a report against someone who isn‚Äôt a cheater, it‚Äôs a report made by someone who KNOWS that person isn‚Äôt a cheater. If I think someone‚Äôs cheating but it turns out they weren‚Äôt, it isn‚Äôt a false report.
---
I use the heart emote to express my gratitude... A 38 year old man making a heart in front of his chest may look pretty funny IRL
---
I was joking, I just needed to pick up a few oil cans.  I'm always running out of something, then later on I find I'm swimming in whatever it was.
---
i accidentaly dissasembled my ps4 controller for some circuits over my kitchen sink :(
---
if your on xbox i can help you with oil,
---
Oh yeah, that would definitely be considered cheating by Bethesda, I think--or unfair advantage etc.
---
I just wish they'd implement perk loadouts on their own, and then everyone would be happy!
---
It was mentioned during a panel discussion with Todd Howard. Much of what they talk about for Survivor mode (and a few other subjects) is in regards to possibilities for the game‚Äôs evolution‚Äîso, nothing is set in stone, as yet.
---
Here‚Äôs the link to the video:

---
That's good thinking I'll have to track one down, thanks.
---
My enemies quake in their chameleon wood legs at the site of my legendary instigating bloodied pool cue :)
---
But... do you also make the urrrrrr-INK noise as you thumbs up?
---
All humans in Appalachia have been killed so it would have to be a vault dweller going rogue. You could probably explane it away with being hooked on drugs and never fitting in with everyone else in the vault.
---
It‚Äôs the smart thing to do.  Let others sell their legendaries and then see if anything fits your build.  
---
I‚Äôll gladly wait...and sometimes hum on mic.
---
you still need help, i can craft it for you if you havent got the plans for it
---
I actually called in support once. We got her to a sliver of health and ran out of time because she kept flying away.
---
I've also had it where she just straight up left the Cranberry Bog. We found her up in The Mire, but she was too high in the sky to take agro.
---
That event really needs to be fixed.
---
I got a plan for a prime receiver on a minigun. No way in hell I'm using it. I'd spend forever making ammo to fire it for 3 seconds. üòÖ
---
Now a gatling gun on the other hand. That's a much more reasonable first rate.
---
If you roll a lot of Queens, I say go for it.
---
I did a census violence event next to thunder mountain substation a couple days ago and the event spawned deathclaws. I killed about 20 death laws during the event, but it was really no more difficult than killing gullets or mirelurks. Deathclaws are way too weak in this game.
---
Situations like this is REALLY the reason why ppl complain about the "griefers" destroying their camp and want invulnerable camps. 
---
Just wait until after Beth listens to the lazy players who "accidentally" place their camp in cherry picking spots like the golf course. Just remember that they are REALLY placing their camp there to AID other players  and NOT for the legendaries...
---
Of course they do. There's more empty space inside a long barrel. /s
---
you did the right thing. I do the same I do not look for trouble but when trouble finds me its a different story.
---
At my old job both me and my boss played Skyrim so I used to do that sneak crabwalk in to the office to get stuff. You know what his response was?
---
"Huh, is someone there?"
---
Old school timeless, lol!  I‚Äôm in my 50s, and still remember when I was young, my dad talking about doing it to his neighbors when he was a kid.  
---
Thanks for bringing back a fond memory of him. üòÅüëç
---
It's not supposed to be available, but cheaters flooded the PC with it, and then a lot of unsuspecting people bought it from vendors or found it in paper bags. Just like the combat armor helmet, you unlock the ability to craft it when you scrap it. Bethesda hasn't disabled it entirely (removing it from inventories and disabled the plan from those that have it unlocked) because so many people acquired it innocently, but they also haven't made it normally available. So it is "available" on the PC.
---
Meanwhile I'm over here firing back to back mini-nukes and ordering in strikes from an orbital weapon platform and somehow I stay in game.
---
Though the frame rate goes into single digits pretty frequently in SBQ fights.
---
So that was you, thought it was a fly in my room, wasted a hole can of Bug-Be-Gone.
---
Had the same experience a couple of days ago at Whitespring Station lol it felt quiet strange at first but also remareable that no one lost patience and start punching others to hurry up
---
There will be a sharp increase in "perfect" weapons if the Purveyor works as most ppl think and I feel a "Bound to character/account" system would have saved this game from a lot of the exploits it experienced in the first months after launch. 
---
And I have this weird feeling we will get at slight dej√† vu when the Purveyor is launched if not "controlled" in some way ...
---
Until Savage Divide #7, that was my hardest to find.
---
How would using an ig system be exploiting
---
I've been giving thumbs up for the majority of my life. Wish I could blame it on Bethesda and not just being socially awkward.
---
Nah, that's ok, was just laughing at my incompetence in stash management.  Found the oil I needed in a couple of minutes of gameplay.
---
The rewards do scale with your level, but the lower level items are still in the loot table. I get level 45 and 50 items from Forest maps all the time.
---
Dont do that, the queen has ridiculous explosive resistance
---
The Queen is, her mobs aren't.
---
It seems I have misunderstood the situation
---
I have all the interesting sets, yet somehow I find ridiculous mixup based on cheap items the most usefull in actual PvP scenario.
---
You cant call people nubs until you grow to the point where you can mop your floor with most of them.
---
If I'm not mistaken, in your other posts you've been saying you have an ass/senti set and its not so OP. Am I correct here or is my memory playing tricks?
---
So I was building my camp...  about two camps ago.  I had the two floors and a bunch of other stuff done when I heard a crash outside.  I didn't really pay any attention since I was in Adventure mode and NPC attackers don't do all that much damage where I was.
---
Then another crash and an entire wall came down.
---
So this player in power armour comes along and is absolutely *wrecking* my camp, just freakin' smashing everything in sight.  I couldn't really figure out why, it was the first time it happened and this was after Survival had come down the pipeline.  Anyway this guy was level 100+, whereas I was about 50 I think.  So I didn't see the point of turning pacifist off and attacking him, just to get my ass kicked.
---
So I took the most logical option, and just followed him around as he destroyed my camp.  I didn't do anything or say anything, I just followed him around staring.  Another player noticed what was going on, and decided to join me.
---
The guy's getting slightly freaked, but he keeps doing his thing.  Then when he's destroyed as much as he can, he runs off.  I quickly select the 'repair all structures' thing in my camp, and then I run off after him.  So does the third player.
---
So for the next 40 minutes or so I follow him around the entire map, fast-travelling when necessary, just staring at him.  Whenever he turns around, there I am.  If he runs off fast, I fast travel ahead and there I am, waiting for him.
---
The third player gave up after a while, but I was determined (and had absolutely nothing else to do).  I even put on power armour for the more difficult bits, and only attacked anything that attacked me.  Always close by, always staring, no emoting or attempting to communicate.
---
After a while he tried to communicate with me, giving me a thumbs up and all, but I was having none of it.
---
Anyway I did lose him after a while.  He had a wanted status amount of close to 400 caps if my memory serves, so he'd obviously spent his time being a dick lol.
---
It was great.  I've resolved to do the exact same thing to any other player who tries to wreck my camp, even if I could take him down.  It's just better this way.
---
...And it didn't exactly cost much to repair my camp, either.
---
I think it's the same attack as the mirelurk king.
---
Or the "legendary" drills lol.
---
With an full wood armor and Drill or chainsaw it looks like we looted a darn DIY Store
---
I LOVED the little music that the robots played! Just a happy little atmosphere. I still have Old Man Winter burning on top of my camp!
---
Yeah that's a pretty rare perk card.
---
Did you wave twice before? lol
---
Already changed my ringtone lol, me and my buddy sometimes go back to helvetia just to relive old times it's pretty pathetic lol
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_burn_centers_in_the_United_States
---
Ive got a Vamp ss mole miner gauntlet recently and I absolutely love it. Would highly recommend a Vamp fist weapon. My health never drops
---
Use the right perks and drop or sell the stuff you never use. I had a similar issue (not 3000..lol) and could not get below the normal character weight limit.  Realized i had to change my thought process and learned to not pick up everything or at least keep everything. Use all various ammo weight reduction, traveling pharmacy, strong back perks. I was about to give up until I used the energy ammo reduction perk...dropped 150 lbs.   I never use my stash for ammo and never keep mini nukes, missiles, baseball grenades, stealth boys or bobbles.  Fallout76 will break you of your Fallout/Oblivion/Skyrim induced hoarding illness. It did to me anyway! Now i run with one set of PA on my person that i rarely use and still have 50lbs to play with while in the wasteland.
---
I'm always dressed as a cop, so after helping I tend to crouch by the bodies pretending I'm conducting an investigation.
---
But only to 1-4 people on the server, and only for the duration of the contesting. They don‚Äôt always fully claim the workshop because they want to control when they can engage in pvp. Either way, people are free to make troll bases and leave pacifist mode on all they want in a month.
---
The last time I did it, the game spawned 2 sheepsquatch and a horse of glowing stingwings. 
---
Needless to say, we did not win.
---
Would be funny if beth say f... it and put it randomly in once or twice a week as the protectrons drive crazy
---
Are you the same person who posted this in my imgur galleries?  Or is there a group of you?  Is it a hobby?
---
It's like the old joke--"Sir, you're the tenth person I've had to tell this to today: there is no demand for that item!"
---
Bethesda has made a few hardcore blunders with this game.  And they probably will continue to do so, heh.  But they've stuck it out.  And people enjoy playing it these days.
---
I think you have a right to say what you want about any game you want, but ffs pick your battles and where you fight them.  Go email Bethesda, start your own thread, create your own subreddit.  Stop shit-posting in our threads.
---
Does camera quest also repeatable as BIV ones? I've already got the camera, moded it for 105mm lenses and use it for challenges.
---
Honestly, I don't think so. 
---
I agree with the user that basically called it Whitespring 2.0. 
---
People got overhyped because the marketing team did what marketing teams do. Way too many people interpreted that as "endgame content." 
---
But what it really is, is a mid-level dungeon that's nice for farming a few times every once in a while. I haven't been there in a couple weeks now. 
---
Almost everything in Wild Appalachia has been low to mid-level challenging and QoL stuff. Assuming anything in this DLC was gonna be endgame, high-level, "you're gonna die" stuff was sure to leave people disappointed.
---
You're really gullible. Every one of you who thinks like this is.
---
That would be great if the resourses were moved out of the workshop system. Then PvPers could be the only ones doing them!
---
I like Anti-Armor and Furious
---
Lies... lol. Anyways I gotta run some errands and meet with a child‚Äôs principle then I should be able to hop on for a hot second. Been awake all night might not happen. Depends on how the cards play out.
---
Doesn't the terminal entry say that the robots can initiate the fasnacht day parade whenever they want tho?
---
It annoys me when a dude starts hitting me with his melee weapon when I'm busy selling my stuff to a vendor. 'Behave yourself!' emote is needed.
---
You forgot the molotov to set it on fire lmao
---
The dart gun made deathclaws a joke.
---
Wow really?  I need to take mining more seriously.
---
Or just keep rambling around doing everything badly, either way.
---
Did you give him a name? Froggo is a gud boi
---
No worries, I‚Äôm free all day. My psn is the same as my u/
---
FiX    dA   gAyYyMe
---
That's gay as fuck.  Holy hell.
---
Same with your comments, dude
---
Did the event this morning and a dude had a turret base by the Brahmin pen. You can bet no one was mad to see a turret base and we easily completed the event with all 3 Brahmin.
---
I don't even know what your imgur page is
---
cant u just scrap it or drop?
---
Back when I was about level 10, I logged in to the game hammered on whiskey. I had my music blasting and mic on, I didn't care. I was running around and noticed this dude following me. Everytime I stopped and turned around, he'd crouch and quit moving. I got a good laugh out of it.
---
np.
---
If you want to share a perk you need the 3x the number of Charisma.
---
1 - 3
---
2- 6
---
3 -9
---
4-12
---
5-15
---
SPECIAL buffs don't allow more sharing, nor does it allow you to share higher, you only gain the passive SPECIAL effects.
---
What you describe is ridiculous. You should be sending multiple mutants so high in the air with a single missle so that your teammates complain you gotta stop using this weapon, if you go bloodied route and maximise your damage output like you described.
---
Considering the ammunition cost and weight, anything else makes them underperforming.
---
I saw a base there Sunday as well. And yesterday i saw one before that, at the base of the road leading to the barn where the bugs attack before the yao guai. It was helpful as well
---
Check the roadmap here. New content comes on update day, which is as you know Tuesday.

Thursdays, we get Inside the Vault articles. They outline the plans for the coming update plus tease what's coming later, sometimes well, down the line. 
---
Check the Fallout Twitter for those.
---
A slider would be ideal as I also have poor vision and prefer to not have super dark nights.
---
Rushing the Sheepsquash for a quick kill is the best way to ensure quest rewards, far too many bugs spawn trying to kill the brahmin, and delaying so everyone gets a shot in is a sure fire way for a quest failed!
---
Yes, you find broken cameras all over the place and you should have the plans to fix it.
---
Salem Witch Museum. I loved going there IRL as a kid and the quest scared the piss outta me my first play through.
---
Start casually making conversation with the person in front of you like you see them every SBQ. 
---
‚ÄúOh hey, Brotherhood771! How‚Äôs the wife, kids? Hope you didn‚Äôt get caught in that rad storm last weekend, it sure was a DOOZY.‚Äù
---
same reason why every guy on the internet has a ten inch dick
---
Seconded. Ark officials are no place for the weak, stomped by alphas, pillars everywhere, people kiting Gigas into your base. This level of greifing is tame by comparison
---
Our sausages are the worst
---
I still want text chat.  I hate the required voice chat current system.
---
Says i need a deluxe camera, not just a regular one.
---
It depends on the builds attacking. I‚Äôve been in groups with bloodied builds where yeah, it was best to rush sheepsquatch. But if it‚Äôs going to take a little bit to kill it, the focus should be on protecting those Brahmin. One person can distract the squatch while others kill the bugs. Those last bugs wreck the Brahmin too quickly
---
Lol, it's my favorite game of all time! Could care less about the glitches and I bought 6 repair kits yesterday!
---
I keep telling myself that I should dump them bu the little voice in my head tells me that I could be missing out on a 5 shot, furious, anti armor, explosive rolling pinüòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah bloodied power fist, I find 4 punches to the squash is faster than juggling bugs!
---
It's like i am paying that dude that is actually making the Cash Shop Items with my 5 Euros everytime and not the whole team so they can add actual content to the game. Feels like if i don't pay that dude for some repair kits he is getting fired and another poor dude needs to do his job, adding more weird content noone really needs. You should actually know that Beth is not a Indie Company right? Everyone is getting their montly Paychecks from the Publisher or other sponsors they will never end producing more content to this game no matter what you give em afterwards in their Atom Shop for items everyone else with experience and knowledge could have added in his freetime through modding.   
---
I don't know about you but i just want to give em a huge load of money instead of tine little pieces over time through the Atom Shop, so they can actually add Dlc Content like we are used too it always was. So i dont need to rage everytime because they added ANOTHER p2convenience item i need to buy because they need that money to feed this poor dude that is making this content.
---
r/subsyouthoughtyoufellfor
---
I find that, with the gatling gun, you use very little ammo compared to the other heavies, so if you're going to upgrade \*any\* heavy it should be this one. 
---
My method for collecting violet flux is to nuke the whitespring and \*only\* gather glowing mass, hardened mass, irradiated liquids until I have 25 of each one, and then I nuke in between Hemlock Holes and Wavy Willard's Waterpark and get 250 violet flux (w green thumb, of course). Then manufacture ultracite 5mm w maxxed out super duper and ammo smith, that should get you two or three SBQ fights' worth of ammo.
---
That's as smart as setting money on fire because you can.  Spending more money on broken game they don't try to fix is just idiotic
---
This isn't an MMORPG. Also everything about MMORPGs is bad and this sort of degenerate hoarding behavior is the worst of it.
---
Just like the devs abd bethesda.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre playing the event in a much better way then. I‚Äôve been farming it so I find randoms to help me constantly. It‚Äôs nice when a bloodied build player joins but it‚Äôs usually mid level folks. In those cases, they gotta help with those damn bugs!
---
Yeah, I'd like to run an  800,000,000 [candela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela)  searchlight (WWII) of my fusion generator.
---
Agreed, Beth has already done it with ESO, i dont see the problem why they wouldnt add it to F76
---
^please ^buy ^them
---
Now this is the QOL change we need
---
Level 150+.  I've found 20+ two-shots.  Found only one explosive.  Never both together unfortunately.
---
I agree with everything except charging Atoms. This should be free and a basic qol improvement.
---
They‚Äôre not facing off. They‚Äôre having tea and discussing which meat has a richer flavor. Brahmin or settlers.
---
It should also tell what part of the armor the mod attaches to when buying armor mods
---
I tried to hold back for awhile to give people a chance to hit it, or try to kite the bugs myself, but that almost always leads to a fail!
---
Oh yeah it was.  Ended up having to bring Bessie in wearing my PA.  
---
Hey, you know a good way to keep mole rats out of corn?  The turrets shoot up more veggies than the moleys eat.  Gotten to a point where we find lead in them.  Kids joke that Mom is making her famous 5.56 tatos tonight!
---
I Have BOS Initiate, BOS Knight, BOS Knight SGT &amp; BOS Knight CPT, But I Just Got One That Is Not On the List of BOS PA Paints Called "BOS Officer" &amp; There is Still Paladin, Sentinel &amp; Elder On the Actual Paint List. So It Seems There Are More That Are Not Listed.
---
That little voice is a real problem, it can be solved with beer üçª üëç
---
Here's the thing, everyone has different corpses on their screen, and if people don't loot the corpses right away they turn into meat piles, and everyone has different meat piles.
---
When a grenade goes off the server tries to ragdoll all entities in the grenades range, both bodies that can be moved, and things that can't.
---
If you throw a grenade anywhere with a lot of things to ragdoll the server has fits,
---
Scorched earth tends to have a lot of things.
---
My camp is just a little north of Yellow Sandy's Still.... Help ya self to it..
---
Yeah loved the double xp went from 35 to 87 just farming the ghouls from the houses in whitesprings the whole way over to gold club then into west tek and over to sugargrove next just server hoping constantly till me and the buddy hit 44 to get our rad sponge so we could take part in the SBQ not that we made much of a difference it was just handy to level up in there and most the high levels had no problem us getting hits on enemies so we could get the xp it was like they were waiting for us to hit them before the one tapped them love the friendliness on fo76!!
---
Agreed. Even magazines don‚Äôt tell you what they do when you pick them up anymore.
---
oh no! Well I guess you need to chase down the tourist again
---
I used an alt to get a second one, I have seen several people with similar issues and went ahead and got a back up. I just waited until someone posted they had the tourist and logged my alt and grabbed the camera from the body. I know its not the best option but it seems to be the only one for now.
---
Video not available.
---
Lever action rifle is fine. Your suggestion would ruin it.
---
Well, the shared stash will be for sure convenient to have easy access to gear/aid/ammo between characters, but it'll be huge problem when maintaining mules - I really don't like to have all the gear for trade in one stash, even if the make it bigger (i.e. 5x800 lbs) - scrolling down the list is a torment. 
---
But I really like to have some kind of transfer-stash, that all characters can share. Make it small (\~100 lbs max) but that way I can easy transfer items between mules and main without the need of help from other players. To not allow players to use it as an extension of their stashes give it a 2h window to claim items with other character.
---
I like the event, but hate that the body just dissapears or is invisible upon death. I'm currently at about 35-40% chance to find a body to loot. And i keep an eagle eye out for where it gets downed.
---
*tooting intensifies*
---
I sometimes see them for sale with vendors but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the game implementing it to the vendor or players selling the camera to the vendor.
---
What exploit
---
Alright. Sent you a friends request
---
The one that doesn't let you vats them.
---
True, but beer has its own little voice which gets louder and louder üòÇ
---
This happened to me about 8 times yesterday its really annoying
---
Know the guy, he does that when he's kicked out of survival mode
---
Started at 10k and sold it for 7k
---
I'm still missing a couple of the plans - I think the effigy and the bonfire. I'll happily buy them off you later. PSN thekikibee
---
I have 4/5 sentinel armor without assasin, and i was killed by two shots from 8lvl guy pump shotty. You need something to survive SBQ attacks, but there is no need to have gear which reduce other players damage from 300 to 3 and hunt them.
---
THANK YOU!
---
I would even have it as low as 30,as long as the server can handle it.
---
Actually if you think about it,spreading your possessions between your toons, will undoubtely reduce the stress on every server.
---
I do t think the people here realize that all these "PvP"ers don't actually PVP. I took a workshop and got killed by someone that came to contest it. Ok, fine. I ran back over and started fighting them. We had a good fight going on for a while and I was actually having fun.
---
Until I took out my explosive minigun and the other guy jumped servers 
---
How is that fun? How is that even PVP? Guy dishes what he can't take and somehow it's my fault because tHaT's pVp!!
---
Not to mention these people never, ever take the workshop to actually use it. Had one guy steal a workshop from me and after killing me 3 times (I was overencumbered and couldn't spawn anywhere BUT the workshop, and hiding didn't help because I was on his compass since contesting initiates PVP no matter where you are on the map [which ALSO isn't mentioned in the warning you get when claiming]) and after he finally claimed it he just skedaddled off. Didn't repair the stuff or look at the resource collectors or anything
---
So yeah. I don't bother with workshops anymore
---
I had that happened to me too. The good ol' Handy stopped dead next to the gate and did not carry on with his route.
---
Shame it didn't happen during double exp weekend.
---
So much black titanium tho... so many gears too... it was nice :)
---
Well not with that attitude you can't!
---
It doesn't work with Grognak's ax.
---
Doesn't it? O.O
---
Is there a particular reason for this? I had no idea lol. Might have to go back to All Rise then
---
I would say I've found maybe 7 of those at most
---
I dunno but I went into survival to get the legendary .50cal and I kept hopping in and out to get the crafting materials I needed and each time I was second on the leader board because there was only one other person on the server
---
Oh boy
---
I think it's by design. The community is trying to convince the bethesda team to "fix" it.
---
I actually say stuff like "hey i left some legendaries behind you if you need" and spam the trade button
---
They're talking about precooked weight.
---
Definitely doing this, thanks.
---
"It costs 400,000 caps to fire this weapon for 12 seconds."
---
Unsubstantiated egos built by narcissistic tendencies?
---
You mean...goinf invisible?
---
I know, but at least it's something.
---
I do hope that we still can destroy turrets when the CAMPs get indestructible as was possible in FO4. It would be good enough for us who want to protect our CAMPs from griefers and still make it possible to get rid of the worst troll bases. Why Bethesda didn't remove the backside of the golfclub from CAMP areas is a mystery.
---
I love building in my CAMPs and hate gravitation defying obcenities, but sadly they will continue to be built as long as the building system is constantly complaining when we try to place our foundations. So will rows of turrets next to spawning spots as long as it will reward the owner with anything at all. I wouldn't mind not being able to loot monsters at all, where the turret has done more than half of the damage.
---
Can't you just squat to not get vatsed?
---
I have that mask not sure where I picked it up though!
---
I agree that this isn't an mmprpg, but Bethesda games have always been about hoarding!
---
Well that's kinda the point. Two are essentially "login and do the thing" free atoms and the largest prize goes to actually having to legitimately put in effort.
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
And the camera teleporting one
---
There's a level scaling mechanic that is said to be pretty ridiculous. You can't have sentinel armor, rely on its protection, and hunt people, you can only occupy a slot and count on them to approach you from a bad vector. You also require stealth boys or extreme distance not to be vatsed into oblivion the moment you are standing still. And even when on extreme ranges, a headshot from right weapon done while crouching and without vats will get through. There are too many counters for sentinel effect and so many conditions that must be satisfied for it not to be ineffective that when serious PvP is considered, sentinel is simply not meta. I use none of it on my main PvP toon, I have another one thats based on sentinel but he has low luck and the whole purpose of his existence is to fight at ranges where no VATS will happen. The other one is useless besides team vs team organised PvP, which is where he shines, not because of armor, but because of map control.
---
Like the private locker in Borderlands.
---
Thumbs up &amp; down are there since the antiquity, so if you thinks it's because of bethesda you have been brainwashed for sure ;)
---
Precisely. While I would love to fire ol' Natascha for 12 seconds, I think I'd have to get some fairly hefty loans from several unscrupulous lenders before I could even afford to pull the trigger.
---
Server disconnect has had me loose junk weapons and armor from my inventory, no losses from thr stash yet, even when I had filled it up to 1400!
---
U have to squat and jump up and down. Your supposed to be invisible to not get vatsed

Just use strobe lights and colored lights linked to the existing siren. Maybe a few switches if you want to be fancy.
---
Sigh :(
---
I really liked it too. 90% less weight, 40% extra swing speed and damage. It was my great gain from farming whitespring nuke zone.
---
I suppose ill keep it incase it does get 'fixed' with weapon perks it breaks very slowly anyway
---
Yes. also fun fact i noticed deathclaw i kill still has reduced armor after respawn
---
Lol. I hate getting in one firefight and then just having to hop because the previous server died after one skirmish
---
Just FYI the level up 0/3 is not to level up 3 times but to meet 3 of the quotas in there, so you can be over level 76, wearing sunglasses while in using a sword and meet all 3 and get it with 1 level up
---
I appreciate that! On PC though. :)
---
The funny part is I'm in my forties.
---
Bloodied is a more versatile affix so I'd say probably not. I'm a GG fanatic but the only one I've primed is my zealots explosive (one shots nearly everything during SBQ fights). But it IS slower rate of fire which is slightly annoying. RIP martial artist.
---
Why don't you do the honors, and explain to the rest of us poor plebs how capitalism and game development finance works?
---
Server hop at mountainside bed and breakfast there are 2 static Yao Guai that spawn every time 1 acid and 2 lead ore make 5 lead.
---
Sorry, Bethesda can't hear you over the people spending money on repair kits.
---
You mean like the perpetual "win hunter hunted 5 times wearing 5 different outfits" that i keep getting
---
An actual event that everyone went to with fun rewards. They should make them weekly.
---
Crits to the head bypasses their sentinel gear!
---
not really since it works with repair kits. I think it's a bug, weapons with no mods can't be repaired to 200% or something to that effect.
---
So it was you outside my window
---
Probably has auto stim assassins sentinel armor.
---
I've scrapped loads of combat armor helmets, only learned the different colour mods, not how to craft it!
---
He was banned for ultracite ammo, the other ammo was just also mentioned since not only did he have hundreds of thousands of rare ultracite ammo but also like a million rounds of conventional ammo of various types
---
Definitely need this. While some mods it is obvious what they do, others arent so obvious. 
---
It would be so much easier than the current no info unless you look it up online system.
---
Same with magazines. I'd rather see what it does before I commit to taking it.
---
He couldn‚Äôt die, dude was afk while groups of people fast traveled to try and take him down, couldn‚Äôt happen, would just bounce up, tried to stagger with shotguns and everything
---
Only pun names are acceptable!
---
i looted a lot of broken deluxe cameras from farming ghouls in the burrows. not sure if it drops from all ghouls or if finishing the camera's quest is a requirement for it though
---
I don't know I think low atoms sales = low funding = low DLC is a pretty fair assumption to make
---
I never assumed I knew the entire game. I don‚Äôt have enough weapons to test everything. Remember the order as well, BUILD, GEAR, Weapon. You can achieve Meta levels using a pipe rifle and a set of wooden armor.
---
Example:
---
Last night I came across a person rocking a Furious Fire Rate Laser Rifle 2*
---
He melted every guy in front of him.
---
This was a weapon combo I never obtained or had time to test the effects together. It‚Äôs very powerful, especially against sentinel users. 
---
My AA faster fire rate 10mm worked in the same number of bullets, and given their fire rate is the same, equal time to kill.
---
The same happened with my Mutant Fire Rate plasma rifle.
---
Different weapon and primary effect, same fire rate and secondary effect.
---
Same result.
---
My theory then was that AA was the best effect in the game. What I learned here is that really only fire rate matters, because the damage cap ensures that the only thing that matters is how many bullets you can eat and bullets you can hit as fast as possible.
---
Yes, I don‚Äôt know everything, I don‚Äôt have every weapon. Nobody does. There‚Äôs not 1 single weapon that beats all, but rather, a class of weapons.
---
Given the game mechanics, I can safely assume that 25 percent more fire rate is the best effect you can get, and testing reveals that primary effects don‚Äôt matter. Something like less action point cost would be very helpful in Vats, so that would be pretty good too. Build is more important in the grand scheme of things, because the range of good weapons is so vast, but also pointless if you can‚Äôt see the enemy at all.
---
100 carry weight is barely noticeable, needs to be bigger!
---
Yeah but the challenges are annoying. Its lazy. ‚ÄúCreate 76 Different beers‚Äù or whatever. It should be actual fighting stuff. Ive yet to see a challenge that involves killing mobs. Ive been playing for 280+ hours
---
This happened to me twice last weekend...in a row. I was at the PV station and someone came in flashing their light at me, trying to push me out of the way, then blasting me with their shotgun. Then I went back about an hour later and a different player started hitting me with their melee weapon. There are literally over a dozen vendors on the map, if you‚Äôre in that much of a hurry, FT to another one üò§
---
I agree.  Now if it were covered with various roadway signage (speed limit, road hazard, stop sign, etc) to look like patchwork armor,  I‚Äôd be very interested.  The Bone Raider was great, but it screamed raider and I had to resist buying it.  Give us something that says ‚Äúhey, I‚Äôm doing the best I can to make this usable‚Äù and I‚Äôd probably pull the trigger on purchasing.  A lot of these paint jobs feel commercial, as if someone bought a set of armor pre-war for marketing purposes and it just sat there waiting to be found after the war (Mothman, Nuka Cola variants, etc).
---
I want to see more skins that show wear and tear, and less ‚Äújust off the assembly line‚Äù.  The plague one was a good step in that direction although I couldn‚Äôt imagine anyone actually wanting to step inside a suit of armor that looks like it has been sitting in a swamp for the past 25 years.
---
the best way to be sure if someone is cheating is simply by power attacking with a good melee or vats criting to the head with an auto.
---
Oh I didn‚Äôt know that. Really good to know thank you
---
I did it all man, made a video of it
---
hoping for the next horseman. they better not keep us waiting another month.
---
Have 25k caps on my only character and I can‚Äôt win on the trade hub cause I always get outbid :(
---
Gun-fu casualty would be a good name for mine.
---
How did you sell it? The game treats it like an atom shop item for me and says it'll be destroyed if I drop it and ownt let me list it to players or venders!
---
ESO is an actually MMO, made by Zenimax Online, on a different engine, with different infrastructure.
---
huh. it's weird that someone is cheating on xbox, then again the game is so buggy it's probably just an exploit.
---
pretty sure you can still dupe for example.
---
Yeah its a lot more helpful, albiet still more difficult than how it used to be with just level up
---
Thats cuz u painted it probs
---
Nice shitpost. Report it to Bethesda, don't try to pass off sharing an exploit, regardless of it's use, as some kind of service announcement.
---
My auto-response over text message when Idont have anything to say use to just be "ok" or "that's cool" now its simply üëç
---
Nope!
---
Yeah i got it the other day, a guy here on reddit made it known.
---
They have plenty. Kill x number of ghouls or critters or mutants or whatever. 
---
As for being easy, yes, there's easy tasks and then there are dedicated tasks but they're not going to make it so the tasks are level limited.  So if you're expecting a "kill 76 death claw hordes with your TSE" yeah that's not ever going to happen nor should it. 
---
The dedicated tasks are intentionally time consuming but they're usually game mechanic based so that they can reward people for testing out the newest missions or features so they can enjoy the new elements of the game. Otherwise many players would have never done a Biv mission at all and never even got the fermenter starting missions they put all the time into.
---
Will this week never end
---
That is the person that you get the Camera and small quest off of. He is a BITCH to find as to being in one of 10 spots (from what others have stated) depending on the server.
---
Have ya tried fo76map.com
---
Keep a fee propaganda flyers on hand to donate to their trash
---

did you also get plastic tho?
---
Heavy guns perks affects guns with explosive bullets.
---
They don't affect missile launchers and the day man.
---
Huh, then no idea. Luck for u i guess
---
Frequency? My Entire time playing and I've only had it leveled 3 times. 
---
Again, if your lucky enough to not have yours leveled, that doesnt immdiately mean nobody elses CAMPs have been. I've seen it happen to other players enough.
---
Not everyone wants to build off in the Boonies.
---
Not once did i claim to "accidentally" have built it by a spawn point, so not realy sure why you saw fit to include the word. These Griefers are not "teaching lessons". These are people thst make it their little goal to wreck another players progress because for them, it's funny.
---
Now, I'll clarify, just incase you missed it, My CAMP sat there for 3 weeks, untouched by other players, seeing many many vissitors who made full use of its workbench availability. The first and only times it has been attacled, were the other night.
---
Fallout 76 is generally considered a Mulitplayer Sandbox RPG. Thats more common thought than no, and i a Far from the only person wanting this CAMP indestructibility. As long as they figure out a way to Balance it with say, someone drsiring to be an asshat negates their CAMPs invunerability when say, they get a bounty, i dont see it as bad.
---
And finally, I'd like to stress again, I am super glad you've been lucky enough to never draw someones attention with your CAMP. Maybe people see it and think its not personal enough, maybe it didnt take you much time to do, maybe you built it in the Baclwoods of West Virginia away from the prying eyes of the average fallout 76er, awesome, great. The doesnt mean your expeiremce is shared by everyone. 
---
In my entire time playing 76, my CAMPSs been leveled 3 times. Twice recently and once in an old location.
---
The first time it was leveled, it was in the middle of absolute nowhere far in the corner of the map, now since you like to say Greifers are teaching people lessons, what lesson was i taught then?
---
Not build a CAMP period because there is a chance, no matter where its built, some clown will destroy it?
---
It's nice to see you've a "Oh, well it's your fault, because I've never had it happen to me, ever" kind of thought process, definetly never ran into thst before.
---
I personally don't have any gear sets other than my sneaky sniper/rifle build.  Every other legendaries I find that don't fit my build I either drop on the ground or pawn to a vendor. 
---
 I do have a shit ton of 3 star legendaries I'm saving for the vendor. (Including some 3* gear I've seen go for 10's of thousands of caps... tse, bloodied, aa, instigating,  ect..).  That doesn't interest me I will just trade for the tokens from the vendor. 
---
As for the imposter quest it is definitely fun.  I love that there is some kind of mechanic even though it is quite elementary. Some people still stand around like a confused toddler though.
---
 I've noticed that the pylons take less damage off of me now than they did last week for some reason.   When the event 1st came out I had to pop stim packs almost non stop.  It seems now I barely have to use any stim packs when I am a conduit of the pylon.
---
 I do enjoy this quest as it is probably the hardest thing to do in the game besides SBQ.
---
I grabbed two thanks to a server disconnect, maybe that's why?
---
Won't matter, next time you log in, it'll be for a different location. It changes for me everytime.
---
Today is Tuesday lol
---
Thats nice, try to aim to head on playstation with crit ready. Normal headshots do nothing.
---
I want that Mothman backpack and nobody will stop me.
---
Reminds me of Jurassic Park 3.  Up till that point, the T-Rex was the be-all, end-all of badassery.  Then the Spinosaurus took out Rexy and dethroned him.
---
Now that slap damage isn't a thing anymore,  I just take longer if anyone starts hitting me or being obnoxious.  It's pretty much the same thing I would do in real life if someone is being a douchebag.
---
No... certainly not everyone.
---
I may have to start doing this from time to time.
---
It's a bug with grogs axe. You can equip makeshift warrior and it will last longer.

I know this is old, but for anyone who comes across this with the same question, apparently Jefferson found remains of a giant sloth that lived during the ice age.

---
I noticed, people are super nice in this game, kinda refreshing (:
---
Or even if it just turned off pacifist automatically
---
Yes I know that. But usually there is an announcement about maintenance and updates. I haven't seen an announcement regarding if there will be downtime today like usual.
---
Do not loot immediately after killing.  Let the body sit for about a minute without looking at it and then proceed to check it.  If it hasn‚Äôt loaded into the body yet try another minute.  I‚Äôve watched the physical items come from the upside down drag through the floor into the carriers body of said loot.  There are moments where the item is stuck and might take a moment...or just never get there.
---
probably just the shop I think
---
Exploit: 
---
1:make full use of and derive benefit from (a resource).
---
"500 companies sprang up to exploit this new technology"
---
2: make use of (a situation) in a way considered unfair or underhand.
---
"the company was exploiting a legal loophole"

This shit i found is just a visual glitch.
---
If we ever get pets, we better get one of these little cuties!

Maybe an alien sighting today?

Can't you just let people enjoy things
---
When I find Camps that are locked up, I will sneak in when the owner enters and leave a bag on their bed with Fertilizer and an I.O.U. Toilet Paper note.
---
On a couple of them I have returned again later and left Toilet Paper.
---
I Never understand why people lock their Camps, it's not like you can steal anything.
---
Use letters and create a sign so others know who they‚Äôre milking.
---
IDK where the plan originates.   
---
Having a similar discussion in another thread, with the  basic question being: 
---
Can mods/plans that do not specify a PA type be used with any PA type?
---
for example, "T51 reactive plates" are obviously for T51 only, but "motion assist servos" or "calibrated shocks" both lack a type designator - can they be used on any/all armor, to include X01 and ultracite, presuming you have the required materials on hand?
---
WILKOMME, MY FRIEND! WILKOMME! *shitty trumpet music plays
---
Not so much what I do as how I feel. While 76 was being weird a while back I took a small break to play "Thief" which if you don't know, involves a lot of sneaking around in the dark. I found it made me feel a little gloomier spending all my virtual time in shadows. Then I remembered times when (in Skyrim or in Fallout 4) I'd just wander and enjoy the beautiful scenery and nice day (great when reality is winter in Canada) LOL
---
I‚Äôd love to even see a hotfix for the dailies!  That would rock!  Maybe increase the spawn rate of the two photographers too!
---
I passed on the X-01 but I will definitely get the others.  Something about the texture I just did not like.
---
I doubt they will add new legendary effects or gear specifically for the vendor.
---
The legendary players system might have some new stuff we haven't seen.
---
That's what we assume with all the griefers in adventure. 
---
They couldn't hack it as raider bosses so they become the peon cannon fodder that my General Chao's Revenge so loved to cleave through by the hundreds in FO4.
---
If you think about it, 76 is an MMO. A *Minuscule* Multiplayer Online game, since it‚Äôs only 24 people on a server.
---
Totally agreed. It's like waiting for a guy to get out of a toilet stall while there are many other stalls vacant, like you must take a dump on that particular shit pot or something lol
---
What do you mean "most games"?  I see a lot of free to play and mobile games do it, but they do that as a way to constantly keep their numbers up so they can stay relevant in the apps stores so they can bring in more whales.
---
Bobby pins? I can't think of another alternative without flaws
---
This is awesome! Everyone I‚Äôve run into in the game has been very nice, except for one player that destroyed my camp. But other than that it‚Äôs been great!
---
Exactly, plus a level 100 player easily will have enough junk to easily rebuild their base 2-3 times - all the while, you're raking up a huge bounty and become a desirable target to other players...
---
Doesn't change my comment in any way, shape or form. The person I was replying to said 'Bethesda has done it before with ESO'. No, a different company did something on a different engine designed for actual full scale MMOs.
---
The engine 76 uses by contrast was made for single player games, by a company that specialises in single player games.
---
Exploitation:
---
 "the fact of making use of a situation to gain unfair advantage for oneself."
---
I suppose you've done extensive "testing" to prove this was just a visual glitch, right?
---
Please, mods don't even give the proper descriptions *normally* when you add them üôÑ they're all scrambled up.
---
Baby steps I guess
---
Why enjoy a broken pile of crap it should be boycotted till the are forced to fix it to how should of been before it was rushed out half done
---
I've been waiting for this change for quite a while now.  A lot of times I'm put off even buying unknown plans because I'm too on the fence with the no description of what it actually does, or makes, etc.  Why can't weapons be viewed when it's still in plan form, like, "if you buy this plan, this is the gun you can make" (show pic of gun the plan is for, rather than some spinning papers.
---
And love the suggestion for the mods and what they do and what pieces they're eligible to be placed on.  I have a nice little stash of 'useless,' as far as i can tell, mods for my urban scout armor, because they don't seem to 'fit' any of the pieces, even after going through them one by one to see which one 'sticks.'
---
Dude chill
---
We had a guy trying to grief us by blowing up our camp pieces while we were building. He just kept making fun of our appearances and saying how dumb our camp looked.
---
So I started walking towards him really slowly. I was a dead looking character in a civil war dress at the time and it was a moonlit night.
---
Him: "quit creeping on me. You're ugly."
---
Me: continues to slowly walk towards him.
---
Him: "hey...stay back." 
---
He pulls out a Fatman. Fires at me point blank and collaterals himself. He falls to his knees and I continue to slowly walk towards him until I'm right in front of him... 
---
Then I finish him off by eating him. Mmmm, cannibal perk...
---
That just means you were tied for 2nd with the 2 - 26 other people who jadn't killed anyone. It put's your name first on your list when you're tied.
---
well the thing is when you repair to 200% the damage goes up
---
yeah, I can see the mold and pustules turning some people off. still, a very nice rendition of plague.
---
This would be a good addition as when you are trying to buy power armor mods you can‚Äôt actually tell what you are getting.
---
The funniest thing is when players pretend like they are not waiting for you to finish at vendor..so funny
---
Yeah I‚Äôve been trying to take a picture of this damn alien for a few hours...
---
Agree.  Upvote applied.
---
Finally found a chart elsewhere in this forum that describes each mod in detail, to which piece it applies, and what armor type it works with.
---
I dont want to go bloodied route. I just want to use a missile launcher.
---
The Sheepsquatch what? Am I missing something?

Southern Belle seems to be the worst offender of this. The hordes tend to spawn pretty much on top of the cows and in large numbers as well regardless of how many people show up. Cross your fingers to hope that they don't retaliate against the SSs or run off in 3 different directions to die alone. High damage auto tesla gun build with suppressor and adrenaline help a lot but still too much luck.
---
I just get in front of them if there's room. I then go into camera mode and do the thumbs up emote. Stick my hand through their chest.
---
It's a non-dick way of killing time waiting for someone to finish with the vendor.
---
Just an FYI my friend, they're called "Klieg lights" or search lights (unless I'm thinking too big) but i do have to give it to you, "Sky Beams" is a great name!!
---
My guess is the green is supposed to be like a pip boy kinda
---
AAE was a tough call, and I can understand why you are upset with it.
---
My experience with Shotguns was a bit inconsistent, as is the nature of the weapon. For that reason alone, I recommend auto rifles more.
---
I had 4 weapons, QE double barrel, AAE Pump, AA limb damage pump, and AA fire rate pump. Skeet shooter and Enforcer were equipped.
---
The enemies did not have Adamantium skeleton in any case, but the numbers would obviously be much lower.
---
The fire rate proved pretty pointless because I was able to oneshot enemies already. 
---
The limb damage proved pretty pointless, since I could punch armor out with a Crit Shot anyhow.
---
The explosive operated a bit differently. Using 100 bullets on running targets, the AAE pump staggered 45 times out of 100, whereas the Limb damage only staggered 36 times and operated worse at range. The targets all have Fireproof and Dense, to stimulate a real enemy.
---
The QE operated very well, even for being explosive. It is more of a spam weapon anyhow. Stagger was 42/100.
---
I would say it‚Äôs up to personal preference in most cases, but the stagger chance, even if it‚Äôs small, is key to using shotguns. Take what you can get, not to mention that range is key on shotguns.
---

---
let me guess, it was a 1* light weight wood leg.
---
I have to agree,  If everyone is running dense/fireproof, that negates the AOE, unless the different ranges in the explosive field also include the ballistic damage as well.
---
Is there a patch scheduled today?
---
Hope your parent is doing okay.
---
Haha I had no idea what they were called, so I was doing google searches like "sky spotlight" and I eventually found a site that identified them as Sky Beams, so I went with that.
---
Not if I know too
---
I'd like a preview of the mods, too. I was surprised when I found out what the "flaming" chainsaw mod looked like
---
"Don't put it out with your boots again, Harold!"
---
"Don't tell me what to do, devil woman!"
---
Pretty normal to see random 1* drops
---
No!!!
---
Make your stable flux in two steps. Gather masses and high radiation fluids from one nuke zone. when you have enough, gather flux from another nuke zone.
---
it's much better but still far from good. mainly because of the bugs and the online nature of the game. imagine Fo4, the buggy mess, but without quick save. yeah.
---
and don't go in expecting the usual Fallout experience. you *will* be disappointed. this is... something different, with Fo elements chuckled in. the **looter**-shooter part is greatly amplified for example.
---
I am getting this error on PS4 too

I‚Äôve just started getting out my mic and asking people to please babysit the Brahmin even though i dont like doing voice chat.

I think diseased ones are sometimes legendary but the prefix doesn't show because they use the same slot.
---
I do the same thing...while in real life I go smoke a cigarette or get something to drink.  Or if I‚Äôm on a team, one of my mates will come over and be a nuisance to them.
---
I do most events as part of a well organized team, the crew I play with can deal with any event very quickly and efficiently, so I don't really care if others show up and leech, except for the SBQ battles, where it can make the event much more difficult and cost me a lot more ammo than usual.
---
If you are not contributing in some significant way, you should stay away from the SBQ battles, find another place to level up your new character, if I see you hiding in the shed, or Rampart I will kite enemies to your location and leave you to your fate.
---
A lot of the bugs that were in the game when it was first released got patched. It‚Äôs is still pretty buggy. Besides that I think it‚Äôs is enjoyable. However it does get a little boring after a while. 8/10
---
There's always going to be multiple amounts of players in the area. Most of us can handle the swarms by glowing ghouls by ourselves; if, players can't handle it on their own - they'll go in, in teams or will wait until more players show up for back up.
---
The idea of "missile turrets being there to aid other players" is complete bull, especially if those players have a disgusting amount of turrets set in place - at which point, the turrets wipe most of the XP out, leaves mostly unlootable corpses, and completely ruins everyone else's gaming experience...
---
There'll be a patch next week with a bunch of new content, but I haven't seen any news about maintenance or updates this week.
---
The only issue with this is that there's a bug right now (at least on PC) where you can click on somone in social / on the map, send team invite and it will go to a complete random instead. So random team invites can also be entirely random and not somone trying to get you to an event &gt;&lt;
---
Haha true that coffee true that. I had a similar issue myself, but after a while trying different solutions with no luck I decided to just let the kids chew through the lead. I just hit up the septic tank every week to two for all the scrap and now the turrets practically pay for themselves!
---
If you are just looking to level up, hop around killing super mutant locations and just kill them. Quests and events are poor exp/hr. Though 40-60 does feel pretty slow going . =/
---
People still play this glitchy/Lagfest game?
---
The problem is they already said the dlc would be free. They can‚Äôt back out on that with another outcry way bigger than last time. 
---
OP is right... despite the fact that Bethesda is huge, this game is an investment for them. They have profit projections based on both initial purchase AND a steady revenue stream from atom purchases. Once the second revenue stream dries up, they are going to stop supporting the game. At some point it‚Äôs not going to be profitable enough for them to added content, cosmetics or dlc, because that is additional labor costs. 
---
All big companies examine which parts of the business are profitable and which aren‚Äôt.
---
Do you forget when they charged 60$ at release along with special editions?
---
Because they did.
---
You only need to buy them one time.

Quest doesn't need to be patched, I have found the camera on three different characters so far without much trouble

Thanks! I‚Äôm definitely leaning towards getting it

Try on the workbench crafting quest items.

For now you can only get the plans for the 105mm lens.

You get it as a reward for completing the camera quest.

Thank you! Much appreciated

I never use thumbs up in normal life :)
---
It's probably to make you look for it. I'm not suprised they put the camera in multiple locations. Everyone I play with had no problem finding it. Best of luck.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm thinking to my self man you are trying to start something you can‚Äôt finish.

My favorite saying for that is: You're buying a ticket for a lottery you don't want to win.

Did that already. Nothing works. I submitted a support ticket to Bethesda now, we'll see if that helps.

Exactly.

So you mean, I can use the card as many times as I want? I was under the impression that those where one-time use?

I commented on this in someone else's post and the "aid other players" bs was the reasoning that that dude used because he was getting handled by the mobs and needed somewhere to repair near WS to help players in need.

Ppl "accidentally" build in opportune places that just so happens to benefit only them. Same reason that they complain why workshops are pvp. Guess once they claim a workshop then they should keep it until they get good and ready to relinquish and stop benefitting....yeah rightüëéüëé

Sometimes reality has to take first place over stuff like video gaming. Noble of you to put things aside to help someone who helped you when you couldn‚Äôt help yourself. Hope your parent is doing ok and hope to see you back in Appalachia one day!
---
Shame, there are a few things that could do with being fixed.
---
Like a 100+ of them.
---
Even if they just fixed two today... drills and syringers removed, pipe revolvers added from/to the legendary levelled lists and stealth not 'breaking' every five minutes for no apparent reason for instance, just those two, it would be a worthy patch.
---
I think free weekends would hook a lot of new players especially with how friendly and giving the community tends to be.
---
I agree that higher sales don't necessarily mean extra content, but if funding drops I don't see them spending money on a game that isn't generating business - just look at Battlefront 2. A year later and content is still dropping at a snails pace. 
---
The problem with paid DLC is it splits up the playerbase, and they can't incorporate events like Fasnacht and Encrypted as effectively.
---
Regarding p2convenience the thing heads seem to forget is you don't need to buy it, weapon degradation is perfectly managed without repair kits and food spoiling isn't that big of a deal when there's an abundance of havestable animals and prewar food.
---
I second this.
---
They almost all have a "type" label, the only mods that don't are for Excavator, and you can tell it's for Excavator because it will scrap in to Black Titanium.
---
IIRC, All Plans specify the type of PA they are for.
---
Totally would love to see this change.  With player trading on the horizon I think we will see a lot more folks buying and selling who didn't want to do it through the other out of game methods.  Not only would it be great for inventory management, it would also help to ensure people dont get taken adavantage of by other players stealing items while trying to get things swapped to alt characters.  It would also reduce people losing anything during server drops.  All around I can't see any negatives to doing it will a limited weight shared stash.  It would be a great quality of life improvement.
---
Yes i have bought only 1 and do that event as often as it comes up, I have no problems being the conduit.
---
Happening to me as well. Was trying to farm ski poles, and I get a crash every single time
---
This would not have happened on European server, it would be chaos.  First people to click on NPC wins.
---
Just one key card and this weeks launch code for the solo your in
---
I like to build a cool base wit nothing connected to the generator like fals advertisement üòÇ and then to roam around like an npc
---
machete mod, sheepsquatch shard, club and staff. Plague walker also deals poison damage i believe
---
Although it was a bug, and it needed fixing, I wish they had fixed it last rather than the current trend which is 'fix what is nice first, leave the nasty stuff for last'.
---
If it comes up you weren‚Äôt the one using the recall keycard, someone else did and you‚Äôre just joining them. Which is always an option. But to trigger the event yourself you need to craft another one.
---
Negative. Bethesda games are sandboxes full of stuff to do and see. You don't need to collect every cabbage in the world.
---
This is great. I need to do this
---
huh, i did not know that
---
If you mean the code pieces technically you don‚Äôt need any. Once you swipe your nuclear key card you can just look the code up on nukacrypt and punch it in. Don‚Äôt waste time gathering all 8 code pieces.
---
I hate the event anymore, it‚Äôs so hard to complete with randoms. So even though I have like 4 of the keycards left, I‚Äôm not ever using them to start the event.
---
Lucky you.
---
It spawns twice in each world at one of 13 locations.
---
These locations are spread over the map, and the odds of naturally inspecting all 13 in a session are rare, not only that but many of the locations are not ones you are likely to return to day after day for any reason other than to get this random spawn camera.
---
It's bad design to have something so important be so unnatural to obtain.
---
Thanks for the insight!
---
Had a great time using my bloodied prime minigun against the SBQ the other day with my group. Had a bot in discord playing the audio for "Meet the Heavy" to really drive home my complete disregard of resources I was expending for fun.
---
reminds me of this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu/comments/i2off/public_bathroom_rage_first/
---
Ignore the bad reviews, it's fun!
---
I do this to my coworkers, not cause of Fallout but because I don't want to actually talk to them.
---
Maybe some already in game stuff will be released today, that doesn't require a patch/update to be pushed.  Alas - that doesn't address the gazillion and more bugs out in the game.
---
Yeahhhh, that's why I added 'check to see if Free Range is active'. Cuz the way I figure it if you open the map after getting a team invite and you see the person in question is standing at Free Range, then you know what's up.
---
I find it hard to believe that people get so upset and emotional over this.  The repair kits sold at the Atom Shop are completely non-essential and mostly useless.  Why would you ever want to spend atoms on one if you can repair you things to 200% durability at the work bench?  Also, any of the players who do the "end-game" events will soon have a bunch of free improved kits in their possession for use in emergencies.  IMO, this whole thing is a non-issue.
---
I don't know.  What's wrong with "Scout Armor: Polymer" :)
---
733 is already the doubled instigating damage
---
If I get a legendary rifle while playing with my character specialized in pistols I need to ask a friend to trade between my characters. It makes no sense that I need someone else to do something that should be so simple.
---
My question here is: Has bethesda ever replied to any topic about this?
---
Pretty damn lazy.
---
Left is cazadores, right is deathclaws, the only survivable way at the start is south, then east then all the way around the map
---
Yep, there's no excuse for it. Whenever I do events like these, I switch out my perk cards [adrenaline, master slugger, expect slugger and demolition expert] and swap out my instigating weapons for troubleshooter - that way I don't accidentally end up one shotting everything. I remember the struggle of trying to level up and bumping into the jerks that would run in and speed kill everything without allowing anyone else the opportunity to land a hit...
---
You're not accounting for damage resistance.
---
Not sure exactly what it is, but it's high for a gulper. They can eat a 3000+ dmg stealth/vats crit and still have 20-30% health.
---
I'm not sure how you would record "Evidence" of this happening, but I have lost both weapons and Armor, in one instance I lost a TSE Dragon when I tried to aim, it just vanished, and on another instance I logged in to find all my armor gone, both equipped and what was in my Stash.
---
I submitted tickets to Bethesda, but only received their canned response saying they could not replace "Lost" items, but I did not lose them, drop them, or mistakenly sell them or even put them in the food processor, the game simply ate them.
---
I recently discovered a weapon on one of my characters that had gone missing weeks earlier, I had checked every character looking for it, but it was simply gone, then it suddenly showed back up again, it would be nice if this happened with all my Armor that I lost.
---
Can‚Äôt find a blank piece to act as a space :(
---
I read this as a buyer beware kind of thing. Sellers can make weapons look like they do mad damage so the less savvy are tempted into buying. Personally I ignore damage stats as I know my build really well but I‚Äôve had people ask me what damage a weapon I‚Äôm selling does. I always unequip perks and heal all rads before answering.
---
Back to All Rise then lol I completely forgot about that
---
I'm in this as well.  I saw this a while back and got all excited that I missed some 'new areas to discover but, alas, I was let down.  The discovery registered when I first found the area but never ticked off the atom list.  It is a bummer because as you've said, that's a hefty amount of atoms to miss out on.
---
Unless I was awarded them and didn't notice and they just never grayed out off the list.
---
Shrugs.
---
isn't as bad as made out. 480hrs in and still enjoying. other comments fairly accurate however, bit tame until you get past level 15ish and starts to heat up.   cheers.
---
n.b.   I thought the price would come back up,since they set up survival mode, noticed a lot more new arrivals in adventure.
---
Wasn't there a free weekend at fasnacht event?
---
Just place down the letters and keep going with the word
---
Example
---
Heygthere
---
Now delete the g and you have even lines
---
Link please? Cheers
---
This would explain a lot.
---
I don‚Äôt exactly remember
---
No, but Tuesday is the day they refresh the weekly challenges and the Atom Shop.
---
Due to my friend helping me we managed to level my alt from 8 to 56. Thats nice now i can play heavy guns with all perks.
---
The one thing I like about Fallout is the organization of the Appalachian economy before the war. Or their proposed reorganization. 
---
The state is gorgeous and there is so much adventure tourism that they could foster. I‚Äôve been saying for years, start creating adventure companies. Ski, fishing, hunting, based jump from the new river gorge. Coal ain‚Äôt coming back.
---
Junk is hoarded due to the sheer resource requirements to get unlock weapon mods, guns and armor are hoarded to better equip a team, food and chems are hoarded to feed and keep a team healthy!
---
Lol yea, it‚Äôs real and so is point pleasant. It‚Äôs really fun to see places you know in real life post apocalyptic.
---
That's the best way perhaps, I see that as more an active way to do so where at least with workshops its passive. Supposedly, if you were to get three workshops that give you 4 extractors for each, you would get 20 every 15 minutes or 80 every hour. So that could net you somewhere along the lines of 72-144 if you have ammosmith or super duper. Which is still crap for an hour of playing lol
---
A very high quality photo
---
Oh lmao
---
It‚Äôs the most dastardly thing I do to other people! One time the person was laying in their bed and I assume they walked away from their game. They left a single door on a second story open that I was able to get to by jumping on my power armor. I snuck around the entire place flipping switches one by one. I will always try to find a way in. I‚Äôll never harm anything, but it still makes me feel like an evil genius.
---
Unless its a B25, stick with the speedy receiver.  Sure you'll do more damage vs. SBs and violet flux is easy enough to manage after a while, but the gatling gun without a speedy receiver or 25% faster fire rate legendary effect just feels blah, it fires way too slowly.
---
Coal is still a bug thing in W. VA, There's a huge coal powered powerplant right outside of Charleston
---
Problem is getting a gap in the words which don‚Äôt show through the letters originally on the sign
---
Great.  Now use that chart to apply "Scout armor: Polymer".  For extra points try applying "Scout Armor: Brawling".
---
My only issue with the new camera is now all my go to Crystal farming locations are usually plundered. Haha
---
KARN
---
I have a .50 machine gun and can go through 6000 rounds of ammo in a day, if i'm not careful. 
---
Scrapping stuff is part of the game. I have more trouble getting steel than I do lead.
---
It looks even enough on the sign. No one is going to gaze for 5 minutes trying to find the slightest discrepancy
---
It just isn‚Äôt going to last. I really think if they can invest and reorient, it could turn into a success story. They got everything they need. Legalize weed and go invest in mountain skydiving or something.
---
True. I just made a new character over the double xp weekend so the struggle is real. Made it to lvl 16 so I feel where they are coming from but some people seem to want the rules to only benefit them.
---
 Hope Beth doesn't listen to the neuterers who call for a danger-free survival simulator smh
---
It was something about the eyes that did it for me
---
Man it was a great weekend!  I think we launched around 8-10 nukes over the weekend.  I went up about 8 levels! ;)  Several sheepsquatches (easy peasy) and other events.  Also finally learned 76 recipies and got 80 atoms!  Woot!
---
This is sadly true. I was hoping to find a good number of content creators also playing this game and end up grouping up with them over time. Unfortunately the popular YT content to make on the game seems to be overly negative stuff that caters to the crowd that hated the game as soon as it was announced. There are some positive creators out there and some balanced ones too but it's both in small numbers and often rather small channels, making them harder to find.
---
In train stations I like to take a seat while another customer is being served.
---
I'm sure I'm not the only one who is waiting for the Sheepsquatch queen .
---
I second this motion. Please provide a link if you can find it. Thanks!
---
Yup. Tired of searching online lol
---
ah ok. But can people see me? Doesn't the game highlight the location of people in the top 3?
---
Hi There! I play a Bloodied/Unyielding rifleman/commando build that I switch up depending on my mood. My main weapon is. Bloodied Lever Action, and for bigger fights I use a Bloodied auto Combat Rifle. I would switch that for a Bloodied or Instigating Handmade if rng favors me.
---
Sneak and Stealth with Gun-fu, Adrenaline, Escape Artist, and loads of Crits from Luck.
---
I love playing this way because I'm always 80HP from death. 
---
I think you have some cool choices because you could also go shotgun build since you have the points in S already I imagine?
---
I think the best is power armor heavy weapons build. Get all power armor and big guns related perks.
---
https://fextralife.com/fallout-76-power-armor-build-guide-heavy-gunner/
---
This site goes through it well.
---
Literally just now wasted nearly 2k caps, 25 super stims, fuck knows how many normal stims and a few hundred rounds of 5.56 because people will not activate the fucking pylons and focus on the mobs rather than the squatch itself. Yesterday's round didn't give me a body either.
---
I really like the actual bossfight as it's more challenging and fun than SBQ but fuck me is it demotivating as hell.
---
Might not be that long as apparently it's up to the robots when to hold it.
---
I'm going to second that maybe shotgun might be an easier transition given your likely point spread. This could let you hot swap between Melee or shotgun depending on the situation but gives you more flexibility without having to completely redo a new character.
---
Well as PVE player, I really do not feel like I need to get the resources from them.  Only thing that irritated me was that Fusion Cores were only 50% (at the time) and there is no way to get 100% cores unless you get the factory, which I was not willing to do.    If there was way to merge cores, that would be a wonderful improvement.  PVPers could still get quick/fast cores while PVE can still get some 100% through exploration.
---
So I really don't care if the Workshops are all taken by people who PVP to be honest, I just don't feel bad for any PVE that takes them over and complains when they get PVP'd. 
---
Now that PVP have their own mode, I do think workshops need to be redone.    Maybe other players can CoOp help build stuff and have to tackle much bigger and tougher waves as more people show up.   Give out small awards based on participation.  Make it a challenge/goal/reward thing for groups of people, and dont think of them like PVP anymore.
---
Caedo Genesis has been making guides for the treasure maps on YouTube. I'd suggest taking a look at them if you get stuck again as he gives a clear view of where each mound is found.
---
I also started off melee.  I leveled up and  switched to a heavy weapons build, then I switched again and did a rifleman build.  I'm pretty rounded out now.  I just have to switch perk cards based on what I need now.  Pretty sweet, really.
---
This has happened to me twice
---
OP said he's an Englishman.  That means he's on a European server (in Dublin or Luxembourg).
---
I killed three sheepsquatch but the burrows has me all kinds of confused
---
I think the best strategy would probably be to have half the people attacking the Sheepsquatch and the other half defending the Brahmin (after tagging the squatch, of course).  Last night, I was doing Free Range and everyone was protecting the Brahmin.  Without anyone keeping the Sheepsquatch busy, they ran over to the cows as well.  Between 2 Squatch and the adds, all three brahmin died within a minute.
---
You just created a laugh.  üòÇ
---
&gt;ranges where no VATS will happen.
---
Doesn't exist if you're fighting an unyielding build with max perception
---
Ah. What I was on a bout was buying the card to actually trigger the event, rather than waiting for other people to trigger it, as the event requires that one-use card to trigger. 
---
Rather than having to wait or server-hop, I don't mind triggering the event myself, but I think the cost of the card makes it hard to consider doing that regularly.
---
No every card is for one call
---
The spawn location moves.  Look in tourist  locations such as the water park, cemetary, fair grounds, race track, etc.  Find the dead body, get the stuff on it to start the quest, craft a camera at a tinker bench and then finish the quest to get a camera lense.
---
If you are melee I found the transition to shotguns seamless and is good fun.
---
Although is feasible to hve a stealthy shotgun build (I know, I know, but hey, rules of the Wasteland man) I play a 'in your face' one and I find it.. very satisfying.
---
Because there is very little 'moving SPECIAL points  around' involved this leaves you plenty to take the relevant shotgun perks.
---
If you are a VATS kind of player Four Leaf Clover gives you crits aplenty (shame we have no Critical Banker but hey, such is life).
---
It was a bit rough at the start with just non-legendary shotties but now I have a QE double barrel and a AAE combat and man is just fun all the way.
---
Shells are also ubiquitous in the Ash Heap so you get to 'farm' ammo and get exp at the same time and because the point distribution is almost interchangeable with melee you can switch back in a pinch to save ammo.
---
That sense of danger is why I play survival. There isn't a mob in this game that is challenging at this point, But people can be scary and you never know what theyre coming at you with. Get a few kills to put you on the board(theres always someone hunting the top players) then start farming the burrows and when you see the ghouls respawn plan an attack, drop some mines get in a good position, and pray they aren't using a explosive laser.
---
What is the best then?
---
So I came back to the game a week or so again trying out the new content and I tried this event for the first time. At first I had no idea what I was doing and I was focusing the squatch when it spawned then mobs when it didn‚Äôt. Then I realized the pylons needed to be used but when I tried to activate it nothing happened.
---
So I‚Äôm curious what the hell am I supposed to be doing and not doing? Cause it‚Äôs was a clusterfuck when I did it
---
Actually, no. My friend does.He took a massive amount of time creating the builds I mentioned and testing several armor sets for me. He eventually went to the wooden armor side of the force, and he‚Äôs never taken that damn helmet off.
---
Possibly not the best place to ask, usually a games specific subreddit will be full of those who actively play and want to talk about the game, so you tend to get biased viewpoints.
---
However, mention 76 anywhere else and you‚Äôll just probably get flamed and told ‚ÄúDed game lol don‚Äôt play Bethshit repair kits lololol‚Äù
---
So here is my honest opinion, as someone who watched the initial controversy and even boarded the hate train for some time. So I guess I‚Äôm only half biased.
---
I was so disappointed on release to hear this game was a mess, canvass bags etc, people were only checking out 76 to hate on it. And damnit so was I. I‚Äôve wanted multiplayer fallout since Fo3, and to hear that it finally happened and ‚Äúsucks‚Äù was very disheartening for the longest time. So I climbed aboard the hate train. ‚ÄúFuck Bethesda, they‚Äôve gone and fucked it up and this is all I‚Äôve wanted for so long‚Äù.
---
I rode that train for a damn long while. Until one day I realised everyone else on the train had not only never played the game, they were just here for the fire. I love a good fire myself, something about the cleansing purity of flames is so entrancing. But I digress, I figured I‚Äôd step off the train, lurk the subreddit and follow the game till it got to a place I thought was good, if it could ever get there.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for 2 weeks now, just hit lvl 40 last night. I picked this game up for ¬£10 second hand. I‚Äôve no regrets. It‚Äôs a good fallout game, at least it is now in my opinion. People complained about the lack of NPCs, but honestly I feel that here it only lends positively to the experience. You don‚Äôt get shoehorned into anything, enter a town in Skyrim and you‚Äôre bombarded with ‚Äúhey player come here I have quest for you‚Äù in 76, you find those quests for yourself through exploration and it makes you more invested and feels a lot more organic because of it. The looting and killing loop is still there and strong as ever, map is huge and satisfying to explore with varied biomes and it‚Äôs far less ‚ÄúFlat‚Äù than maps in previous Bethesda games, Fallout 4 was just a sea of flat brown, 76 is lush and forested, filled with hills and valleys and cliffs, it‚Äôs a joy to explore. Add on top of that it has a great community, and the fact there‚Äôs other players running around the world to encounter creating all kinds of crazy experiences, I think it‚Äôs the best fallout game Bethesda has made, even if it had a lot of teething issues. If you like fallout, I‚Äôd say pick it up on the cheap and never look back.
---
But I also strongly recommend that you do inform yourself, there are still some issues, and while at this point they are a far cry from the dumpster fire launch, issues remain nonetheless.
---
can we make this a thing....obsolete caps and replace them with unlimited carry weight bobby pins!
---
I've seen that happen too often. I do like the event, and it's about 50/50 as to whether people there will do things right and take turns using the pylons.
---
I wouldn't mind as much  if I didn't have to fork our those 2K caps :)
---
I see. Well apparently they act better online than in RL.  I'm in Germany and there is no concept of lines here.
---
Keep an eye on your screen too so you don't waste film, it'll say what it detects in the frame in the top right
---
I'm linking a post on here with a mod list this is super helpful a big thank you to u/jchamlin for putting this together
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ag37qe/fallout_76_all_plans_recipes_weapons_weapon_mods/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I still want to see this in game. We shouldn't have to resort to using a 3rd party source
---
The drops you get from the event are hardly worth spending the caps.  More often than not, we've gotten screwed on legendary drops from it.
---
If you were on PS4 I would do the event with y‚Äôall
---
‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
---
People are too selfish for the event to work, I've done it roughly 10 times and only won 3 of them.
---
Agreed, that way you can switch between both 
---
I also came to realise that SPECIAL points I "needed" in each Category changed as my levels increased and my inventory expanded. I also crafted a few Shielded Undergarments to fill in SPECIAL stats passively when I need it. Currently its S4, P11, E2, C5, I5, A15, L14.
---
It used to be 4,8,2,6,6,15,15 and I may adjust it more but for now I'm waiting on Legendary Status to roll out. I'm over lvl 200 and have been playing since October last year. :)
---
I was out herding my Brahmin in that rad storm too! Broke my shepherd's crook though, damn things won't budge if you don't have that thing on you. You'd think I could shove them since I was in PA but no, they won't move an inch
---
I play primarily because I'm a Fallout fan. Secondary because some of the stories are interesting. Third because I actually find it relaxing as a sniper build and a blood pumping experience when using my melee build.
---
Check above. I responded to this person, but the main point is that explosive adds more stagger chance. It is vital to using shotguns to maximize stagger sciences.
---
It depends how you define best - I think the best is T-51b - it has highest both DR and ER and only lacks a little in RR, which is easy to overcome with Rad-X: Diluted. It's also cheap to repair and you can have jet-pack with it (ultracite don't have jet-pack). What's more, all mods are easy to buy, while plans for Ultracite drops only from high level SBs (80 lvl, rare drop) or SBQs.
---
Right.  PA \_mods\_ I have picked up do clearly state to which armor they apply.
---
  The generic name \_plans\_ I bought from a vendor in whitespings were 
---
"motion assist servos" and "Calibrated shocks"  
---
Both lacked a type designator, and both worked on more than one PA type in my inventory.  
---
  For the purpose of the question, I don't have X01 or Ultracite, so I can't  test/validate the theory the generic plans work for all armor types.
---
&gt; I'm in Germany and there is no concept of lines here.
---
Well of course not, Germans are famously disorderly.
---
I blame that Adolf Hitler myself, he gave discipline a bad name.
---
damn i bet you really really really had to use the restroom after playing LITERALLY all weekend
---
Only Six more days till Yak Shaving Day
---
And the last unsolved quests just sorta showed up a few Tuesdays ago with no patch so my hope springs eternal.   I need more heads on my wall
---
like a lot of 'triggerables' in f76, you might need to trigger it a few times before the effect starts happening. When it does, you should see some electricity running over the pylon / generator, and your health will start going down.
---
Triggering the three pylons makes the assaultron sheepsquatch visible / and reduces its shields, making it attackeable as it will actually take damage.
---
The best thing in my opinion if just for people to take turns between activating the pylons / attacking the hordes / attacking the assaultron sheepsquatch.
---
Ideally if people take turns in using those pylons then you might not need to use stimpaks, just let things run their course until you die / then just respawn and repeat, hoping others will do the same.
---
Yeah if there's a line in Watoga I just go in the train station bathroom and shut the door and make weird noises over the mic. 
---
someone once came and opened the door to see what I was up to and I yelled "EXCUSE ME! Do you MIND??" and they laughed.
---
Now that'd be something.   Just a zetan in my garden later lol
---
I‚Äôve got a recipe I can sell you
---
Thanks for the info. I‚Äôm going for a sneak/sniper build for my survival character. Killing from a distance. Fallout pvp is just too clunky.
---
People do that to me and it makes my session longer, it's distracting and annoying and you might as well shoot me, just sayin'
---
We are the civilized few
---
Do you have a rough estimate of the the improved stagger chance: explosive vs faster fire rate?  Have you tested against the pneumatic mod with/without fireproof?
---
*atom sounds*
---
Better then jumping out behind the fake plants at whitespring with a loud SPAGETT!
---
way too spooky
---
I've managed to interrupt people by pushing them away from the vendor.
---
I don't do it often, but it is fun.  Not sure how it works, because you can't normally push b people, but you squat down in between them and the vendor and sometimes it moves them back just enough they get interrupted.
---
üòÖü§™

I have a hunters explosive that I got a long time ago, decided to put the prime receiver on it. I noticed a bit of a difference, I also farm Flux and materials and pretty much stay on a mound of around 8k ultracite 5mm. Side note, Harper's ferry is a good spot to nuke for violet Flux as well.
---
I don't know how the console world works, but until FO76 is on Steam or a similar widely installed launcher, I don't see a free weekend doing all that much for PC.
---
pretty much the same as pvp. unyielding, sentinel, AP refresh
---
The one in burning mine was just a generic green locker - one in a row of 4 or so.  
---
I don't even remember if it had a diamond marker - as I was suprised when I took an item from he locker, the quest complete sound played, it disappeared from the list, and the item reward list scrolled off.
---
It could work tho.
---
I agree, I'm just short on a imposter sheepsquatch outfit, so will probably grind the event until I get that. 
---
The legendary issue is across the game, RNG far too low, meaning you always get crap weapons even when you kill a boss. 
---
Not saying I'm expecting a bloodied two-shot-explosive... actually who am i kidding, of course that's what I want :)
---
On the other hand, some people are so impatient they start throwing grenades after like 10-15 seconds
---
This is hugely helpful to know it different between types of weight reduction.

I was stuck in a no pylon takers event yesterday. No one would take them. I ended up holding all 3 for about half the timer.  Apparently I was also the only one with an energy weapon. It cost me some stims but I ended up with almost a 1000 fusion cells, as no one knew what to do, so there was tons of extra bots. I ran around tagging them while avoiding the squatch.  At this point I dont care if it finishes or not, it's good for farming. One of these and a lucky hole provides about 10k 5mm and 1000 or so fusion cells. That's worth the caps easy.

---
There are times where people are doing the right thing, but yeah it's a shame it doesn't happen as often as I would like .
---
Wow never knew that, thanks!
---
It's an event I wouldn't bother doing unless you have a team of competent people with you or you use a mic and coordinate people as it seems no one know how to do the event yet
---
Everyone is ‚Äúmax‚Äù caps these days when it comes to trading, your cap stash is essentially useless. The events are expensive, but it gives players an outlet to spend caps on. The event is to hard? Should have saved your Troubleshooters weapons and armors. I run a Troubleshooters exploding handmade and the boss melts. Adapt to change!
---
Just gotta hope for people to do the right thing. It does happen, just not enough...
---
Ah ok so that would explain how I randomly went down by the pylon. So do I need to stay near it until the shields come back up or can I help out and move?
---
It should. I've seen people walking around with a lot of weapons during trades.
---
When someone nukes the prime fissure. Save yourself some time and start farming stable flux, you'll need some
---
Yes! How much?
---
yeah this is what alot of us have been asking for for a long time now, and you described it perfectly, i think it would actually work!
---
i hope someone from Bethesda reads this!
---
 /u/Ladydevann could look into this?
---
I have a vampire + faster swing speed gauntlet, It will take down high level super mutants with 2 hits using stealth, level 50 SB in about 6 hits, level 80 in nine or so.  My health stays full up.  If I speced for unarmed weapons I could increase damage.  With the third claw it is getting about 168 damage, playing with the perks make it better.
---
After a SBQ, I hang out at the train station like it's an after party (it usually sort of is lol) just so I can see what people sell and drop there.
---
I agree on all points. I honestly wouldn't mind paying atoms for increased stash space tbh. All the mule accounts and stash issues.....ughh. Hopefully they can implement this in some way. I really hope the legendary vendor and player vending helps alleviate some of these issues.
---
Is player vending still slated to drop next Tuesday?
---
Some people here telling you to pick up everything instead os looking at the item. That doesn't change anything.
---
I've got legendaries disapearing by the time it took me to reach the body and look at the inventory. I don't even care about what legendary it is, I've had this happening so much that as soon as the legendary die I run to it and mash the buttom to get everything. I'm still losing some legendaries doing this, sometimes I can't even read the items name before it disappears.
---
I'm putting myself in danger all the time, running in the middle of enemies to make sure I'll get the items before the body disappears. I shouldn't have to do this.
---

---
That's not true. You don't see the Instigating effect on the weapon card.
---
Goddamnit so much, why didn't a blueprint of a basic defense station occur to me? Thank you!
---
As long as I still had the option to play with friends who arent yet 50+ on the "standard" servers all gravy

link added to the thread

The rumor I've heard regarding explosive 'legacy' laser and plasma gatlings is that when fitted with the Splitter mod, they do full damage on each particle, (which explains why they break so fast to - game things you're shooting like 10-20 shots per actual shot). Is that what's going on?
---
yeah this has happened to me too at whitesprings, there are like 5-6 OTHER vendors but they wanted to be at the one i was selling to right then....lame
---
Make a (serious) offer
---
Top tier shitpost.
---
This!
---
Guys in 330 days it‚Äôs mista day
---
And I find myself queuing for the whitespring bus outside the clubhouse, that is until some damnable blaggad blows the blighter up üòÇ
---
Sorry you cannot get others to conduit, but that's partly due to the design of the event. The event still needs a longer warm-up timer. When the event pops-up, I'm probably at 20% health and unable to be a useful conduit. 
---
It takes at least three minutes (given two load screens) to switch from bloodied melee to a higher health heavy-weapons build, suitable to be a conduit. If the event started slower, I'd play nicely with others more often.
---
I started going full health, in PA, so I can tank all 3 pylons if needed. I use a 1* vamp auto handmade I found against the bots, which helps a lot with the health loss. If even 1 other person takes a pylon, it more than compensates for the damage. So, when I see someone take one, I make it a priority to keep them revived.
---
One good thing of doing it this way, is that most of the knuckledraggers will go and draw aggro from the squatch. I hop around the field dealing with adds, and then start wailing on the squatch in the brief moments between waves.
---
I don't see the event much at all lately, and if I do, I don't always join anymore. I don't really need 10 more white fedoras, or more 1* legendaries.
---
yeah its dumb for game companies to just assume that people have the internet to google stuff
---
All of the game Destiny's lore is not in game, it was required to use the internet to view lore, for another example of this
---
Well that's not too bad then. Have a couple of unyielding across the gear and one sentinel. Next time I go into Whitesprings ill just stand still and whack blindly at the ghouls.
---
I don't really use VAT's so is AP refresh worth it? Aside from running of course
---
Yeah I‚Äôd start a new character for one. You can spend your perk changes on this one so you can swap from melee to either heavy or shotguns.
---
I need this feature. I play solo, none of my friends play. I have three toons with different specs and when I want to share a good find I dump it on a vendor and then server hop with the target character until I find it. It works, but it is very time consuming. This is one of the top 3 features on my wishlist.
---
I always felt guilty killing one of them
---
One of the other issues is that the body just vanishes and your don't get anything, good or bad.
---
I generally buy recall cards when I'm at max caps just so I can sell stuff filling up my stash, but yeah it is probs the harshest thing to lose. 
---
I am glad the ammo expenditure isn't as high as Scorched Earth though, failed that the other day and wasted like 1000 5.56 and a couple hundred 45.  Especially hurt as I was farming munitions plant all weekend and the thought that that was entirely pointless hurt lol
---
I wish they'd just make it a no build zone, or making pacifist mode extend to camps is going to suck. Every server will have someone camped at WS.
---
In addition to unyielding, sentinel, AP refresh, I put a lot of stock in my PVE armor‚Äôs ability to reduce weapon, chem and junk weights whenever possible.
---
I have some friends that play fallout but won't buy 76 because the horrible launch it had, a free weekend would be good to prove them it's a better game
---
I believe it is user error.  Those of us who have been playing a while get really fast at mashing those buttons.  It becomes muscle memory, but occasionally muscle memory can trick you.  I can't tell you how many times I've been scrapping weapons I've picked up by mashing the X button, then exit the workbench, go to equip a weapon from my PIP Boy and automatically hit the X...which of course, drops the weapon rather than equips it.  It is very, very easy to do.
---
Good catch and I agree
---
YES!!! but dont charge for it, just let us transfer stuff inbetween characters, it would make the game so much better
---
so many bad things have happened to this game, horrible launch, terrible reviews, so many bugs and mess ups,
---
the least Bethesda could do is actually listen to fans about what could make the game BETTER
---
But, you can drop an item into a container or sell it to a vendor and have another one of your characters pick it up or buy it. Just requires a lot of server hopping. So, if you can have have multiple characters access the same container, why not a shared stash box? Seems like very similar functionality.
---
I would like the event to have a longer notification time before it starts. I see it pop up on screen and hit the stash box. Most times it's over before I get there, like under 3-4 minutes.
---
Also it's cost is a big turn off.  I can farm other 3\* legendaries for free...
---
I was seeing this even before the Sheepsquatch events! Hoping someday there‚Äôs an actual Sheepsquatch attack to defend at a workshop!
---
I've said the same thing. It needs to be cheaper to start, or there needs to be events where you can earn parts/all of cards.
---
The rewards are generally garbage, so the cost/reward just isn't worth it.
---
I completely agree, it gets frustrating. I also think they should add what like furniture plans look like because I have no idea what I'm buying.
---
I still buy them here sand there. My teammates and I have a system. One always takes the pylons, I get on the roof and just fire at it with my mini gun and the other two will get on the roof and fire at it and jump down to heal people, especially the one taking the pylons. It works out really well. So I only buy them when the 4 of us are on together because I know we‚Äôll complete it.
---
I even spent perk points on first aid just to get the healing up, but a vamp legendary sounds like a good idea.
---
I see where you're coming from regrading the rewards, you get a lot more for less just nuking whitesprings.
---
As a person who extensively tested VATS range across all possible theories and all relevant builds, I'm very specific when I call these ranges extreme. I'm talking about shots done from few hundred meters, at the renderability border. I have a specific character for those situations where your team denies enemies access to vats range to you. Its my side PvP char tho, my main is unyielding sneaky sniper.
---
[](/celestiafrown)That's nice, I paid 70 bucks for a game that was selling for 30 a couple days after launch. Y'know like a pay for the content of a full release game.  
---
I also payed 70 bucks for Skyrim which had 273 quests, 130 dungeons, and infinitely repeatable quests in the base game.  
---
76 has just over 150 quests as of the most recent update (that includes quests like: "craft a weapon","investigate the shack", and "tune in to top of the world radio". No true repeatable quests(even the dailies are hopelessly bugged). Then there's dungeons, what would you say there are? The buildings in Watoga, The abandoned mineshafts, there's like 10 of those, there are 6ish caves(depending on what you want to count.). So what's that? 30, maybe 40 if we're being generous?  
---
I'm going to be honest, they've shorted us on quite a bit of content that we already paid for, and what we have is fun, and I enjoy playing the game; have no intention of quitting, but if we're already to the point that Bethesda has to start nickle and diming us just to keep content coming then we're fucked. Most of what we've gotten as it is is recycled content and stuff that Creation Kit veterans call lazy one day of work projects.
---
I just didn't like that it made every power armor skin into x-01.  It looked pretty cool though.
---
&gt; I haven‚Äôt had this happen, nor do I know anyone that has, but to me it seems like something that could happen. 
---
No, actually it doesn't.
---
Wonder if those sweet handmade skins will drop soon?
---
totally agreed~
---
also, its infuriating to play on Ps4 as as soon as i load into the event, the game starts to stutter and framerate drops to the low single digits
---
No, if you killed someone, then you would have really been in 2nd place, and would have shown on the map.
---
Yep gulpers have annoyingly high DR. I tend to avoid them.
---
Still happening
---
I don't know why people say this about the dude. I have about as skeptical a mind as could be possible, and I find him much more balanced than just about everyone else. 
---
In this day and age when "journalism" has become laughably intertwined with opinion, I find it refreshing that someone at least tries to be objective.
---
They changed that. VATS was being used to quickly identify players from far distances. They made it so unless someone is "hostile" to you, you can no longer initiate the encounter with VATS.
---
unfortunately the way things are going it seems they want us to BUY things with real money, they will never give away free atoms
---
i agree it would be a great goodwill gesture to fans and new players, but i just dont see it happeneing as it seems now the #1 concern for Bethesda is making money from the atom store
---
Perhaps
---
Not really no, small side quest, some atoms dumb stuff. If you happen to stumble across the camera ok. I didnt think it was worth it
---
It is, a little alert pops up in the top left screen. How ever I have seen it not appear though.
---
You are right man the existing quests in this game are pretty abysmal, especially the amount of side quests. I guess that's yet another argument for why there should have been more NPCs, as without them it really limits the how and why of quests.
---
You have to complete her quest. Once it‚Äôs done she takes it from you
---
Sounds like Sentinel is really the most important thing to have on your armor, with AP regen or Rad Resist or Vanguard / other stuff just being "nice to have". if I could find someone that would actually be willing to sell me decent sentinel gear for 25K caps each, I might consider getting into pvp a bit more. Just so much work to find that gear though. 
---
If Sentinel was nerfed, would power armor be viable in pvp?
---
Yes, it wouldn't be too hard to show a picture of the couch you're buying instead of a freaking piece of paper.
---
Well I've been modding them to get the defences as high as possible and lead lining them where possible so I don't get obliterated by radiation.
---
Them ghouls really love their Rad Worms :/
---
Have you tried dropping them in the blue suitcases and switching characters then rejoining the same server via the players list (holding the start button)?  You can do this easily on the main menu.
---
Oh. I got that quest from Anne up around palace of the winding path.
---
I don't know why it exists. I guess it's kind of cool to now be able to take photos in places the game would previously tell you there was no room. Other than that, photo mode is superior in every way.
---
Great idea! Throw in a cool named legendary for just logging in that weekend and they would hook a bunch of new players.
---
dodgy. in pve you'll essentially be invincible.
---
I'm willing to help, I can craft the legs for you with calibrated shocks. All I ask is for the majority of the materials and the Flux.
---
(PS4) I've done the quest, got a card, but haven't started the event yet.  Any advice on what i need to get through it?  lots of stimpaks etc?
---
Bethesda needs to get on this shit.
---
&gt; I'm not sure how you would record "Evidence" of this happening,
---
&gt;  in one instance I lost a TSE Dragon when I tried to aim, it just vanished
---
If you're on PS4 just hit *share* and save the video clip of the last 15 minutes.  Xbox has something similar.
---
Is quicker than photo mode if you want to snap one of those 'blink and you miss it' moments.
---
Personally I think it is; I had to do this twice (first time it bugged on me after a 'Disconnected from the server' moment) and still went ahead a did it.
---
Never have had max caps before. The event is easy , but I'm not a trader , and I don't make cap stash runs , I enjoy the hell out of farming scrap and killing enemies. I buy plans as soon as I can afford them . But I've never had more than 10000 caps at one time. I'm sure I'm not alone. So no , not everyone has max caps.
---
Mods are a different story entirely, I was only offering an opinion on legendary effects. Mods I always use are dense on chest piece (invaluable for explosions and scorchbeast blasts) and deep pocketed for everything else in PVE mode (I prefer to carry around a lot of stuff and spend very little time at camp).
---
Had the same issue lol. Mission if it again on Xbox trying to find it again now.
---
I haven't found anything stronger than all rise yet. Has anyone else?
---
One will literally spawn right at the entrance to white springs in front of fast travel spawn point
---
[](/celestiahappy)Hopefully we get some cool quests with the coming updates as soon as they've gotten most of the bugs hammered out. I did notice that one daily that isn't bugged is Biv's quests, so that's a good start.  
---
I also agree more NPC's would've helped a lot, or just using the ones we've got more. Rose has a fun personality, would love more quests from her, and MODUS is really interesting would love to have more to do with him.  
---
I still hold out high hopes. It's just going to take a while.
---
What i've been doing is waiting for the 'free range' event to happen, see what kind of people join in.  Then just make an announcement over the mic that you're going to trigger the encrypted event.  most people will give a thumbs-up as a sign that they're in.   It's been working out real well for me.
---
As I play most often solo, my strategy is to do everything I can to minimize chaos.
---
This means I‚Äôm now carrying a freeze option on all 3 of my characters. STacks of cryo grenades, cryolator, etc. I also only enter the event unless i have enough stims to take at least 2 pylons, possibly 3.
---
I can count on other random people to want to shoot / hit, but you can‚Äôt guarantee any of them to do pylons or control or anything. I just assume they are all wacky selfish and waiting for someone else to do the moderately hard and responsible bits. So, I do those.
---
I've managed to find one for 5 different characters without too much of an issue. Plus people on here, myself included, have been posting on here when and where they've got one.
---
If you can beat the Queen, she'll drop the advanced repair kits that will allow you to go up to 150%
---
Good thing i manged to get the old man sikter ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Gorge Junkyard, and Blackwater Mine? (place that Uranium Fever event spawns at) are you best best.  I just took over the workshop in the early game for black titanium.
---
Well I only ever have Adrenaline on as my agility cards so I suppose I can give it a try and see what's better :)
---
To add to the previous comment, when you join a server, look at the bottom right corner of the map for a blast zone. If it's there and no event, that means it's already been done and won't happen again until another nuke is dropped. The event has a 30-min timer and is usually finished before the timer runs out, so you have to catch it when someone first nukes that area. When you see it happen, get down there asap. I've seen the queen go down in as little as 5 minutes with the right mix of players. Usually 15-20 min is more common.
---
Hmmm...hadn't thought about drainin' the old septic tank for scrap.  Probably some good nuke material in there too with all the Quantum the kids guzzle.  I'll check that out!
---
Similar functionality, sure. But I imagine the implementation would be wildly different I suspect.
---
With vendors / boxes, loot remains for a time on live servers. Your characters are also assumably stored individually on part of their servers.
---
So a 'middle man' stash would have to be implemented at an account level, that can communicate with all of your characters at once, independant from what current 'world' server you're in.
---
To me this seems like infrastructure that would need to be baked in from the beginning or require some kind of serious overhauling.
---
I second this \^
---
This
---
What If i told you, i did this event only one time, and i won a witch mask that i loved, few days after the event was over. I FUCKING SCRAPED IT :(((
---
No problem gl
---
It's been discussed several times and there are rational explanations for its presence in 76.  The main point is that the technology was not unique - it can also be found on firefighter Protectrons (which is how you find any Cryo Cells at all outside of Vault 111) - and it's not surprising that multiple people may have come up with the same idea.  To that end, we call them all "Cryolators" for our convenience, not suggesting that they are all clones of *the* Cryolator in Vault 111.
---
This seems impossible, but from my experience people have gotten worse about being conduit. Seems like 90% of the time if I don't try to do all 3 conduits nobody does. Kind of frustrating.
---
I have the exact same problem. The notification needs to start well before the event does.
---
I mean, you don't really *need* dodgy in pve, especially if you're not a bloodied build, but being invincible is always nice.
---
Great idea! Although, we have to be prepared for the toxic people that might show up during that time since they've got nothing to lose. Definitely needs to be after the patch that makes it so our camps can't be destroyed with passive on. I almost feel that this will be the FO76 version of fraternity rush week lol.
---
It took my up to last month to think about it. Home defence 2 and the building perk - and I farmed as many of the bases I could, trying to collect new recipes and such. It was pretty nice. My only reccomendation, put some cheap stuff in missle range to draw walking enemies. Otherwise they hide. Give them something to attach basically.
---
Does it? I have seen it for Encryptid but not for Free Range even when I was 'in the region'.
---
This even really benefits from having a bunch of people. It is really tricky to keep all the brahmin alive on one's own specially when they game decides to throw three yao-guai then two 'squatch you because reasons.
---
what platform?  I have hundreds more shotgun shells than I need.  rather give ttrade them for other things than just dump them in a bag to be lost.
---
I went to YouTube first (New camera 10 locations) then I was off. I went to the race track, no corpse. I then ran to the lighthouse, no corpse. I fast traveled to Wavey world, no corpse, server hopped there, no corpse. I went to the battlefield cemetery, no corpse, server hopped, no corpse.
---
I fast traveled to Bolton Greens and found the corpse! I crusied back to base to make the camera and no crystals lol I went through my stash over the weekend and cleared out the crystals. So I had to go farm for crystals so make sure you have all the items to build it.
---
It‚Äôs given me a reason to farm crystal ;)
---
Yeah, we tried that but the stuff gets stuck in my teeth.  Since ol' doc Brown left, getting to see a dentist is literally a pain.  Plus, the flashes at night seem to attract Mothmen.  Creepy buggers.
---
I‚Äôve seen the free range event on the pop up on the screen. But I‚Äôve also seen it on the map but I don‚Äôt remember a pop up
---
If I told you there was a bug of which literally ‚Äúbroke‚Äù a player, making the game literally unplayable which had a permanent effect. 
---
Or what about a bug of which caused players to essentially hit a ‚Äúdelete item‚Äù key when normally playing the game?
---
Both of these have existed. The PA bug was around for an insanely long time, even with how it literally made the game unplayable. The other was the ‚Äúfeed the people‚Äù event. You could argue that was user error but you‚Äôd still be wrong. Under normal circumstances you can not put your own items into the container which was set to consume items, however a bug made it happen and literally deleted personal items. 
---
Let‚Äôs not also forget that there has been 2 pateches thus far which has re-introduced old bugs. It could abolsutely happen.
---
Lots of stims, Troubleshooters Legendary weapons are a big help. . . And of course at least 4-5 competent people. Keeping the conduits alive imo should be priority 1. If they go down and bleed out, you cannot dmg the imposter anyways so . . .
---
Shit... *begins to fortify camp with concrete.
---
Attention to detail and dedicated hard work.
---
Yeah, they are super expensive and it's not often people show up, much less beat the imposter.
---
The problem is 3* legendaries aren't guaranteed to drop 3* items; the event specific items &amp; plans are cool but not enough. If you're out for 3* items then you can just go farm anywhere else for cheaper &amp; much easier.
---
The game NEEDS ways for people to spend their caps because it's so easy to max out and as a result the economy is pretty broken right now. If they're going to keep the asking price for the cards then give people more incentive to do the event
---
oh right, thought you meant the mods! Well I have noticed quite a difference without my calibrated shocks from wearing power armor when im using normal armor so some deep pocketed might be worth it.
---
I didn't realise that scorchbeasts were coded as explosions, so that's definitely a good tip :)
---
Thanks, and sorry about this follow up question, but do you mean just Flavors of Mayhem, or the Keys to the Past as well?
---
And you're a lazy bore.
---
If you want atoms, it unfortunately is. I think the camera is cool, but the random way you find it is not whatsoever.
---
This makes a lot of sense and works for why I have similar problems when everyone in my group is running explosive weapons. Things are flying all over the place and my frame rate goes single digits.
---
It does but i think it's random or proximity based
---
If you want to complete the challenges for atoms you might want to pick it up - as it appears a lot of the daily / weekly challenges might be camera related for a while just like they were all beer related after Biv came out.
---
Well that's how I usually felt in power armor. I have to handle getting knocked about a bit now
---
I Completed all the quests for rose and the syringer was taken from my inventory. I think it‚Äôs after flavors of mayhem. But I might be wrong
---
Agreed I bought a "comfort stock" for the lever action but that's not even one of the options in the crafting menu!! Idk what it does
---
I know, my explosive vampire shotgun became so much more useful to me because of this event.
---
Build a new character! Its fun feeling vulnerable again. I get to about lvl 60 and abandon mine, it's fun switching builds up.
---
In the last couple weeks, I've run across several unescorted cargo bots.  
---
  When not escorted, they seem to fly a figure 8 above the same spot.   Much easier to shoot them down... :)
---
Well, this is a good way to level up just because of the mobs, and they have a chance to be legendaries. So it makes sense for people to focus on the mobs, as annoying as it might seem.
---
Why do you like the games?
---
 That looks amazing! Not only a loading screen but I'd use that as my desktop wallpaper for sure
---
Sorry to hear that mate.  Bessie is a good girl so it wan't too bad.  I also had my plow still hooked up to my excavator.  A little poke move's 'em pretty quick.  
---
Speakin' of herds, you hear about the squatch sighting over by Wilson's?  Dang fool kids stories is all I know.  
---
Ain't no squatches round these parts.  I'll believe it when I sees it.
---
No.
---
The cost is simply not worth the potential rewards given the risk.  Risks include the event failing due to lack of players, the difficulty of finding the invisible body, and server disconnects.  Rewards need to be balanced to the risks and the cost of initiating the event, and currently they are skewed to the point where many players don't bother crafting the initiating item due to the component cost.  I certainly wont.
---
never done the mission, as soon as I found out it costs money I said fuck that...
---
Curious as to where the renderability border is. With 37 perception (after all bonuses are applied,) I've had many times where I've picked up an enemy in vats but not been able to see anything regularly
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Nah, I just checked. They specifically state under the nuclear winter section of the roadmap that they are adding in prestige. 
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
I really started using thumbs up after watching Twin Peaks. So in FO76 I feel like I am honoring Special Agent Dale Cooper whenever I use that emote.
---
Yeah, I'm not saying they shouldn't do it, but if it doesn't net much on PC, I hope they don't write-off the idea prematurely. 
---
I just know the game-purchasing habits of my older-teenage relatives, and they're much more likely to sample games on Steam compared to those that require their own launcher. They also have their own Steam dollars, but not their own credit cards to buy games through Bethesda's economy.
---
Oh yes!! I'd love to have one of this hopping around my C.A.M.P and gets overly excited when it sees me come home. :D
---
Idk the few times I see it up now it's been done before I could get there fast enough. On pc anyway I don't think many care about it anymore. Hell someone nuked the queen the other morning .. not one person went to it. The loot is so bad right now I wonder what the hell is going on with the devs. I would spend $$$ in the atomic shop if they wouldn't be such pricks with the loot system I just don't understand the reasoning. Take a good long look at anthem Bethesda.... think about it lol
---
I think your problem is with the conduits not the card. The card is supposed to be expensive to avoid it being always active, giving a reason for players to actually try to complete it.

Envious. On PC and I went everywhere he/she could spawn this weekend and nada. Even hopped a bunch a times at the water park. I know I'll find it eventually, but I think part of my problem may be that I'm not exactly sure where the corpse is specifically located. At the water park, I know it's next to the car right in front of the player spawn point, but is it possible to miss it if you don't know that for the other areas/attractions?
---
Really need the option to be able to make tamed creatures follow you around like companions and fight enemies you become hostile to, at the moment they‚Äôre glorified camp decor and not much else.
---
Also I‚Äôd like the option to get a collar or some kind of ownership note when taming a creature, you could trade them to other players and sell your tames for caps!
---
I got an explosive Gatling gun they just does too much damage
---
I don't do the event unless my team is going because you can't trust people to do pylons and our group has someone who always takes all the pylons.
---
Do you have to be the one to let it in or do you just have to be there for the quest to clear? I‚Äôd like that out of my log as well.
---
They could just do it for console... I think? I don‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt work at Bethesda.
---
It's a great game if you're into open world exploring. There are parts of the map that I've been over half-a-dozen times or more, and I'm *still* finding new stuff.
---
Make sure to wear adequate protection to prevent air and waterborne diseases!
---
I had given up a while ago I just happened to be running around the map and then boom!
---
Lol
---
That's actually a good idea. I see posts on here regularly for Grahm, SBQ, etc. I might try that next time.
---
It's still definitely a Fallout game. There are still bugs, and balancing issues, but it is gradually getting better. That being said, I picked it up after Christmas, and have several hundred hours in. 
---
Either way, I don't think are any players who haven't at least gotten their money's worth out of it.
---
(XB1) It's even more frustrating when all the level 30 people show up and do absolutely nothing. They don't activate the pylons (which of all people they should) and they can't do damage cause they don't have high level weapons. They just create a giant Cluster Foxtrot. I gave up on that event three days after it came out because of people like that.
---
Has anyone ever gotten a 3\* sheepsquatch?
---
This is really a team/server event.  You have to wait for the pylons to be ready to activate.  All three pylons must be activated before you can attack the imposter sheepsquach. Once the game lets you know he's vulnerable, you can attack him until the pylons go down and you have to activate them again.  It's best to have 4-8 players to be effective.  One person stationed at each pylon.
---
Same here
---
It got bad reviews for a reason. You might like it or whatever, but there is a reason it's widely called a disaster and got near universal poor reviews and has been the worst selling besthedia game.
---

---
Radroaches... everywhere.  Half a dozen spawn locations in/around Flatwoods...
---
Chickens can be found around the area behind the Aggrecultural center in Flatwoods, keep checking in the dry river bed down toward the workshop, hop a few times if needed.
---
Bloodbugs, random spawns around various farm houses.
---
What's so funny
---
It was never as bad as people made it seem - yes there are a lot of bugs that are sometimes frustrating and some things have not been handled well but it's still a really fun game. There's a lot of places to explore and we find new things all the time. I personally recommend having people to play with as I am one of the people that wishes there were more NPCs in the game but I did solo the entire game / launched a nuke solo and then I finally found some people to play with.
---
The only thing is once you've done all of that - the quests and the nukes - you gotta kind of find your own end game - some of my friends just want to kill the end game bosses all the time - I personally like collecting things - I've just collected all the pipboy games and I'm working on plans + magazines right now. But they're releasing a lot of new content right now and there's a lot of things coming up so if you get it now you're going to have plenty to do :)
---
Ive had PA components that were near breaking get destroyed several minutes after a SBQ or SB fight on lagged servers. Others just break. So its possible you took damage and teh server caught up.
---
It's converted to the metric system.  So 25lbs of weight = 10lbs of lead.  /s
---
Pretty much the same here. . . I primed my FFR Furious GG, but left my Bloodied, AA, Troubleshooters, and Vamp with the speedy. I too miss Martial Artist : (
---
How about the alien!? Where is a damn alien? In the tube? I would think it would be a flatwoods monster but that‚Äôs labeled as well.
---
Chickens are a random critter spawn, if you server hop at green country lodge they sometimes are in a group of 3 on the little slope near the spawn point. 
---
You can find a radroach in the weight room at green country lodge or upstairs leading to the beltower in the flatwoods church.
---
You often find bloodbugs towards the middle of the new River gorge bridge.
---
I would appreciate a fix for the "I've hit xyz 10 times with my melee weapon and while it makes the "oh no you've hit me sound" it takes no damage" bug.
---
I have an example that happened to myself. One of the challenges was take pictures of robots. I had all but cargo ship /vertabot left. I took several pictures at WS station but they were a little ways away so I thought that was the issue.  So I called in a supply drop and was up and close still didn‚Äôt count.  I happened to be in watoga and they showed up there I took another 4 or 5 pictures and still didn‚Äôt count so I have up.  I did look around and from what I can tell this one is achievable but just not by me.   I did have trouble getting other camera challenges to register but after a couple of pictures it finally accepted them. Not sure if it was server lag or just didn‚Äôt get the right shot.
---
No offence but you're in a sub of fan biased towards liking the game. Your going into a butchers shop and asking if you should eat meat or be vegetarian. 
---
Personally if you're a big fallout fan.....then....This is what elderscroll online is to the elderscroll franchise. It's another game with reference thrown in to tie it in somehow.
---
Doesn't cost money when you do the mission.  It's free for the first time cause you get the item from the quest (consumed when you finish it).
---
Mission actually ends right before you summon the Event as well.
---
I did it once, through the quest, but no one would be the conduit except me, no one would help when I was down, and no one took out the mobs. I'd love to try it again but it's way too expensive to buy the cards. I just want to try it and win for once.
---
I don't mind them. . . As long as they are trying to revive the conduits. Outside of that they're definitely a liability for this event.
---
Inspecting a weapon should show ALL the details the weapon has, legendary effects, mods and all of its overall stats, damage, health, fire rate, etc
---
it's very similar to the silver paint - just black. There are lots of games that allow you to color your armor however you like, so $8 to change your paint seems like a little much
---
I've noticed that the problem is that people won't conduit. I see people trying to jump in on the squach after it's vulnerable and they can't do shit for damage, they are being wasteful, those are the people who should be conduits. I don't conduit because I got a Furious Shocking Mr. Handy Buzz Saw that does great DPS to the damn thing, all I need is a few minute to have it reset health, then a few more and it's dead. That's just if I'm the only one damaging it, but with help the 4 or 5 times we've killed it, we've wasted it in minutes, my Buzz Saw and someone withe  minigun.
---
Also, I don't waste stims on this event, I just die, it's a huge waste to use stims when this fucker can just one shot kill you from full health.
---
I would love to get some more of the sneaky Taxidermy quests in today. I need that Deathclaw!
---
the build I use with my QE harpoon [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f443b9a&amp;d=sr1s32sq2s01s21sb2s12ip2a72s72a00a81lu2lt2l71c71ls1ib4eh2e60p10pq1p40&amp;w=&amp;n=grenadier&amp;m=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f443b9a&amp;d=sr1s32sq2s01s21sb2s12ip2a72s72a00a81lu2lt2l71c71ls1ib4eh2e60p10pq1p40&amp;w=&amp;n=grenadier&amp;m=)
---
Do you know where the spot is?
---
No alien in the game (yet)
---
I did the event once and was so confused.  I revived people and killed tons of bots, but how do you trigger a pylon?  Every one of them I ran up to had people by them.  Am I supposed to stand there too or should I run around getting bots if they have the pylons?
---
I have a key card but I've never been in a silo
---
I was getting one-shot killed (Legendary deathclaw) with 250hp wearing a full set of Excavator armor and using a vampiric MG. There's definitely something different. I used to have literally hundreds more stimpacks than I do currently, so I'm definitely running through them much faster now.
---
Definitely would run it more for 1k caps, or better yet give a free run per day or as a weekly login reward.
---
Keep a watch on the ammo too. I always noticed I was given 10 syringe ammo upon login too
---
We had a queue at morgentown half enclave half brotherhood guess what happened
---
Sorry. I forget text communication isn't always recieved well. I felt your sentiment about the damn tourist. I was laughing my ass off when I read that. I just woke up and I'm high. Just ignore outmodel he's an idiot.
---
You can do this but you risk the server crashing etc
---
Whitespring station. Theres the mine where uranium fever is held. There are rocks surrounding this mine. Get on top of the cliff thats further down a direct line between the station and the mine. Aim on the station roof. This is example distance - depending on my route of approach, and the particular point of the cliff, station tends to disappear on my RTX2070, i7 8700K, 16GB of meth-addicted RAM.
---
Actually, the Flatwoods monster is the alien and it's in the game
---
That's nice, i got an adhesive farm + razorgrain for everyone to take, i got 10 missile turrets too lol, since i play almost alone those moving turrets make me feel less lonely, i will add a brahmin as soon as possibile :D
---
Yes but not for the purpose of this challenge..
---
I blame the fact we need min max builds to do it, sometimes I run with a friend with a OP melee and we were able to do it just me and him, I ran to pylons and he wailed on the sheepsquash.
---
We good? Gimme dap dog?
---
The Flatwoods monster counted as the alien in a bunch of challenges for me
---
I've noticed people are pretty bad with this and started to pop 2 pylons on myself and someone else usually huts the 3rd to get it going.  I have 340 hp and speed demon so I can usually just kite around easy enough and land a hit in and back off.  I've tried to pop all 3 on myself but the hp drain is way too much stacked I think.
---
This would be good but would rather they refine the game a bit more to entice new players.
---
There is a possibility of getting legendary power armor, it‚Äôs in the game file. But it could be just an unused fallout 4 asset. Really hoping they add some prefixes for our PA though
---
Ah, that explains it. I'm on PS4, I'm sure you're rendering much further than I am
---
I figured it was for my gamer tag ;)  ...  my camp is set up like a church
---
That is part of the trifecta for my stealth melee build:
---
\- Stealth breaks and the 'gauge' goes Hidden &gt; Caution &gt; Danger in a second flat even though no enemy has line of sight and I have 25 AGI, lvl3 Sneak and Escape Artist.
---
\- VATS collision detection glitches and even though the enemy is right in front of my nose the chance to hit is 0%.
---
\- I exit VATS and connect a hit... except the enemy gives less fucks than a honey badger about it and proceeds to shoot me in the face while I paw what seems to be thin air.
---
I would go with the generic but sweet - Daisy &lt;3
---
I saw somebody back there, thought it was a robot or something cause he's been back there for 10 minutes  and messing around a-and then he jumped out and I saw that it wasnt a robot, it was actually a... full grown man...
---
It was kinda surprising
---
I figured it was my gamer tag ;) my camp is set up like a church even
---
Angry Joe was doing this, and holy fuck, I've watched a lot of his reviews in the past, but he did not even remotely give Fallout 76 a chance. He did the stupidest shit and it was clear that he was trying hard to dislike the game. 
---
\*Shoots a low level over and over while the low level tries to ignore him
---
"But this is a survival game, isn't that what you're supposed to do in these games, just kill eachother? That's what these games are about, being toxic and griefing people"
---
Jesus Joe, if you actually did a tiny bit of research you'd know that they specifically implemented anti griefing measures.
---
And then he forces 2 other players to try to kill a vertibird with him, with their level 1 pipe rifles, stupidly assuming that it would have lots of high level loot.. even though vertibirds have never been lootable in previous falout games. Spends like half an hour killing it and then gets pissed when he gets no loot.
---
Sorry Joe, you're a fucking moron.
---
At least Delrith actually played it and got to end game, gave it a proper review. I swear, these days I just look for Delrith's reviews on Joe's channel, he does a far better job, and actually is a hard core gamer, which it seems Joe is not anymore.
---
They could do both, have like a sale instead of free
---
Yea I agree, I wish they would have login rewards like Warframe and Fortnite STW
---
That is true! I think the Sheepsquatch event randomly appeared later though? Or am I misremembering? Xxx
---
I died in Bravo the other day and the only place on the map it would let me respawn was Whitespring. I was a teensy bit mad...
---
Heard rumours, but for me it's always not legendary or 1*.
---
Better then that creepy clown that comes out at night, that just stands behind me when I afk to roll a doobie. Gun drawn and everything.
---
It's so cool that's it's a real thing. I'm loving the people in VA confirming areas of the game IRL.
---
Yea the challenge is to take pictures of different cryptids. And flatwoods monster is one and alien is one so does it count as both when you take the picture?
---
nice
---
I always feel guilty when I've killed them as well. My wife loves them, and I wish we could capture one and keep it in our C.A.M.P's.
---
I too wish we had more tools to get immersed. I am all about RP and come from an RPG heavy background.
---
We need things like character names and the ability to emote without putting a cartoon over our head. Text chat with emotes would probably go a long way here 
---
I don't know why but the devs themselves seem to be totally out of touch with RP even though they have made a game where it could thrive.
---
  An hour is all you need if you are in the right nuke zone.
---
Hardended mass and hi-rad fluids don't spoil, but do not always drop.  Loot and hold.
---
Flux does spoil.  Upside is spoiled flux turns to water, so at worst, you have a good source of rehydration.
---
Alas, not all (colors of flux) are in the same nuke zone.
---
Downside of not being able to FT - getting to the right nuke zone for the color flux you need.
---
I've also noticed some people dump bags of excess (and sometimes, unspoiled) flux at the closest vendor point.
---
Only if the opponent is not flagged hostile
---
My favourite is when I clear three or four locations then the server crashes. I still haven‚Äôt found it either yet all I‚Äôve done in my hour long slots where I can play is search for it. I would kill for a permanent location. I have a child, full time study then work on top, and I don‚Äôt think quitting everything to sit on the couch and play games all day like other players is a good plan for me.
---
Serve. And.... ZzZzZZ
---
I look at everyday objects and mentally break them down into materials. Everytime I see a clipboard my brain goes, "Oh look, springs."
---
I didn't think of one at the time. But I was thinking along the lines of maybe Flibbit or Fredo.. Lol
---
Xbox saves the last minute by default, but in that case I spent 15 minutes looking for it, and thinking I must have somehow dropped it.
---
I've had 90 atoms for like a month. There is a huge drop off once you've gotten the main challenges.
---
Yeah, the one where we are playing fake computer characters in. 
---
There is a separation of reality and fantasy when we play these games.
---
I let the Legendaries I find guide me along.  I'm a huge fan of my basic Bloodied Gatling Gun, and took the first rank of each Heavy Gunner just for that.
---
You want to augment melee with guns, otherwise it not only gets repetitive, but melee is also rarely the fastest way to kill a mob.  That's why I'm so big on the Tesla Rifle.
---
server hop a few times at toxic larry's meat and go, 3 snally's there
---
What's a dap dog? I feel so old not knowing all this slang
---
I run a low health vampire build. This way I don't need expensive sentinel gear and can focus on qol weight reduction effects while still maintaining survivability. I never need a stimpack.
---
This is correct, I lost mine after the Flavors quest.
---
Was it towards you? Or was it something else? This person obviously does not know you at all. Are you sure he wasn't playing a role?
---
I mean nothing you have said convinces me he was doing anything other than playing a really good asshole.
---
They really should do a free weekend. Boggles my mind how they haven't done it to get over the controversy around launch, because the experience seems to be that the game is better than its reputation when people just start experiencing it
---
Ok so it kinda was. When I read that whole post i swear the GT made me laugh the most. I'm actually so glad to hear your camp is a church. Totally outstanding. It gives me a warm feeling that the lordjesuschrist lives in a church. üòÇüòÇüòÇ. Thanks.
---
Or he was insulting the character and the OP took it personally. We'll never really know with a one sided story
---
Of course there is. My question is: are there limits? Maybe I was too jarred by this guy since I‚Äôd never run across anyone like that before. Maybe he was out of line and maybe not. Where is the line? Can he say anything and do anything in the game?
---
Rifleman, tank Killer, cant remember the luck one but it's the one that makes heads explode.
---
Not spent any caps on it, I usually server hop if I'm looking for it, or just join if someone triggers it.
---
I think you give him too much credit. He doesn‚Äôt know me, no. It was jarring to be yelled at by a real person for no reason.
---
I did it in our lab the other day.  Some of the peeps that report to me are gamers. They laughed.  Others were like wut?  Lol
---
I really like this idea.  I have multiple 100+ characters and it would be lovely to share all of those fantastic camp plans that are more rare!  Need moar discoball!!!
---
Not for photography purposes, no. Photo mode is better. One problem with camera on PS4 is that you can snap photos from outside the range of closeup LoD, so you end up with well composed photos of objects with low res textures if you're standing too far away.
---
Fun fact.  It applies to ANY armor except the excavator and Ultracite.
---
I don't reall the exact name of the place - 
---
One of them is near top of the world...not in the building where all the mutants are, but the place with lots of mole miners - with all the "vendor stalls" were, (kind of like an old bazaar), and the circular "arena" where there is sometimes a PA suit.
---
I tink the other was beckley?  Far left of the ash heap, south of Camden....workbench with crystals and oil.
---
Don't recall where I picked off the other one.
---
I think it would be a good idea once they feel they have the servers rock solid.  It's getting there.  The past week has actually been very good, at least in my experience.  I think I've run into more hard crashes, mainly when loading indoors, than disconnects.  The server itself is still running - I can rejoin via friends.  There are just issues with the client to be hammered out, and considering what kind of stress a free weekend could put on the servers.
---
This is good. I‚Äôm maybe not having enough fun.
---
Order and cohesion? How positively unamerican!
---
at this point i store every single legendary i find incase one of them becomes ‚Äúlegacy‚Äù lmao
---
Oh man, this stupid argument?
---
IMHO glow sight 3 is great in a nuke zone.
---
It would probably be a ton of alt accounts.  Free alt item transfer weekend!
---
This has already been discussed. Can‚Äôt share stash between characters because it would be too much strain on the servers to load in that many items.
---
I've never said that it was your fault that you got razed to the ground I said to LEARN  from the experience. I see that you have been there to actually"see it happen to other players" and also "see your many, many visitors." Awesome.
---
The lesson learned is if someone can see your camp they COULD destroy it and no amount of complaining will change that. Ppl stop through my community building with my crafting stations, water pump and anybody can take water purifiers, beds, garden out back and most leave some kind of bag for me. Not mandatory but they do
---
If they pick my lvl 3 locks to get inside my restricted well decorated home, then I kill them. After the first 4-5 murders they stayed to my open community building. If they level it, they level it. When dealing with ppl it's a possibility because EVERYBODY aren't cool.
---
 Either you'll come to grips with some online ppls want to destroy things or you won't: the world doesn't change for you, you change for it...or you just stay annoyed bcuz ppl do whatever they want to
---
There‚Äôs 3 reasons to grab the camera:
---
1. It can help you find dead enemies and their meatpiles in long grass, also it will help find the imposter Sheepsquatch corpse if it goes invisible upon death.
---
2, Its quicker to use than photomode if you pop it on your fav wheel
---
3. You‚Äôll need it to complete certain atom challenges
---
That‚Äôs about it though.
---
Lucky Hole mine
---
Bloody mess
---
Not much honestly. In bulk you could probably get 75-100 a stack
---
I have rifleman and tank killer, neither of which seem to bring the damage up, I do use bloody mess as well, it ramps up my melee damage by quite a bit. I forgot to mention I also use PA by default. Maybe that's the difference?
---
I look around the map before I waste a circuit on the recall.  Most people I‚Äôve lvl 150 ish tend to have a clue at this point so if all I see are a bunch of low level players (below lvl 80) with only a few higher level i server hop till I can find a good group.   So far this has gotten me much better results.
---
Bloody mess is the one your talking about, also gunfu &amp; adrenaline can boost your damage against mobs
---
Commando, tank killer, obviously demolitions expert..id also take bloody mess and concentrated fire if you use VATS at all
---
Flairs are coo too especially at night
---
That‚Äôs not bad considering i have almost 1000 gears
---
I‚Äôll look for it
---
Honestly I hope they add more stuff like the encrypted event. That event is currently the only cap sink in the game (except for plans off vendors). 
---
All those caps aren't any good with nothing to use them on. Most traders I know don't use caps anymore.
---
If there's a free weekend, I will make "Wasteland Starter Kits" for all the new arrivals. BOS Recon Rifle, 308 ammo, purified water, exp / various buff foods, Shielded BoS Knight Under Armor, and Plasma Grenades.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right haha in your case that‚Äôs pretty good!
---
I just put on Marathoner/Action Girl and Field Surgeon and run laps around the pylons.  I can realistically only take one pylon myself because I'm Bloodied, but I go into a hit-and-run strategy.  If the Imposter is running toward me, I run away.  When she invariably stops to attack someone else, I pelt her with my Bloodied Gatling Gun until she starts chasing me again.  As long as you keep your distance, she can't do that instant-kill melee attack.  And if you have Field Surgeon, your Stimpacks can heal faster than her laser.
---
Demo expert really isn‚Äôt worth it for the 5 cards it requires.
---
Bloody mess (luck) maxed is +10 damage.
---
Also covert op (agility) is great.  As long as you are hidden it 2.5 x damage.
---
guns fu (agility) is by far my favorite with the lever.  Just mow through high levels while in vats.
---
If the game allows it yes. IMO the only way he is out of line is if he is personally attacking you (the player) and not the character. That can easily be blurred too because many people don't have a sense of their character as a separate entity.
---
Lets say this other character is talking smack about your mom. If he is in character and acting the part, is he really talking about your mom, or is he talking about your characters mom?
---
There is a difference. There are plenty of actors who have played extremely bad people on screen but go home to a totally mundane and normal life. 
---
Roleplaying is absolutely a place to step outside your comfort zone and put yourself in different shoes for a while. Many people play baddies and some are just assholes or bad at it but it doesn't necessarily speak to the actual person clicking the keyboard.
---
It was kinda broken being able to farm them over an over for legendaries, i understand the change.
---
Don't expect a response, they don't owe you anything. 
---
This "dear bethesda can we get a response" karma train really needs to just stop and people NEED to understand they're not of any importance to be making demands.
---
I'm in the same boat. I started out just making a general character with no weapon perks but a focus on things like carry weight as well as camp.
---
That won't get you through Wes Tek solo. 
---
thanks to the XP weekend I went from 70's to 90's and grabbed the melee perks. I can now walk through the inside of Wes Tek stim free if I sneak and pick my sneak attacks.
---
Problem for Wes Tek is that front entrance.  Having a long gun with some ass would have made that much easier. Especially when you have a suicider running at you.
---
If you are going non auto then run rifleman, tank killer and gory mess I think it's called. That last perk will also work in a melee build. Your talking a minimum of 10 perk points to get those cards. Little grinding. Good news is that the rifleman doesn't slot in strength so with some perk card setup work you can have either the single or double melee going along with the rifleman option. Allows you to switch it up in a single run.
---
Were you all Hanging on in quiet desperation?
---
It's a really good idea, but probably Bethesda should start a marketing campaign that show the actual real situation of the game. This would encourage people that love Fallout, gamers that just like to play and maybe youtubers and streamers. Then they would launch Free Weekends, maybe with double XP to reward people. The only problem i could imagine is advancing in levels, because at the start you are very limited by the level. This is something i accepted since the first time, but there are people out there that land and find the gold SCAR, and they won't understand and just go with "sTuPiD 76". Well, at least, we, usual players will help them!
---
I‚Äôll tell you this; it certainly isn‚Äôt worth the frenzy people have been whipping themselves into over not being able to find the tourist. What a complete let-down of a quest
---
It is kind of cool to be able to take quick pics on the fly without going into photo mode but that‚Äôs about it
---
Is this really a question?  
---
The answer is video game balance design reasons.  There are scorchbeasts and super mutants and ghouls.  The realism behind salvaging lead is probably one of the lowest on the totem pole if you're going to split hairs over realism.
---
This is the correct way to farm acid. Hemlock holes isn't worth the time. In 30 minutes you'll get 30 acid from Hemlock. In 30 minutes of Larry's you'll get 100-200 acid.
---
When do we start to worry
---
Of course it is, but that is totally why anyone with a motive to scare you would do it.
---
Y'know, whenever I hear others whine about being at max Caps and having nothing to do, I wonder why they don't just share their fortune with someone who isn't swimming in Caps.  After all, it's "so easy" to make them, right? üòã
---
Could use the benefit from 1...thx
---
No problem man, I'll add you. I might raise the prices though, because everyone else is selling for several more thousand.
---
That may very well be how YOU approach this game, but you (we) can‚Äôt know the motivations of this guy. 
---
I take your point about role playing, and I will concede I may not be having enough fun with my character. But honestly, IF he was not role playing he was indeed and asshole and was griefing me for no reason. 
---
Most of the players I run into in the game are cool, chill. This was out of place and disturbing I guess.
---
yeah could really help on console for power armor mod since not everyone on console have internet accessible whenever they want
---
(and console internet browsers is trash at lest on ps4)
---
Everyday now, he's out there in the forests man I saw him. He had red eyes and everything. I ran back to my big truck and hauled the shit out if there ,üôÉ
---
You have to use the search bar to find the newest posts of what you need that aren't as popular.
---
Did you try throwing the ps4 out the window and buying a new one? That worked for me when my game was messing up
---
My rough estimate is that the stagger chance for explosive shotguns without any perks is 10 percent.
---
Check the stats I responded to the other guy with.
---
I have not tested those things as I did not think of them, my bad, but pneumatic leaves you vulnerable to explosive damage, so I probably won‚Äôt test that.
---
I‚Äôm not sure of the true mechanics behind shotguns at the moment. It bears closer inspection.
---
Yeah, for as many times as I've done this event, I've weirdly never found one of those outfits (the one that's superficially like the Cultist outfit).  Got a bunch of Smooth Criminal fedoras though.
---
And here I thought I was the only person with 1000 gears
---
My hopes and dreams have been ruined
---
I tell myself every day stop picking up gears. But I just don‚Äôt listen
---
Just south of the Big Bend Tunnel in a red garbage truck there's a Zetan corpse.

You can sell your legendary items to vendors!?
---
That was like a Thursday lol.  Things show up on days is all I know anymore lmao
---
&gt; But most people don‚Äôt want to spend 60$ on a game that they might play once or twice. 
---
It's between 18 and 30 EUR on Amazon at the moment.
---
‚ÄòMany‚Äô
---
Ideally i would like an actual or trading stash box with a double check.  Both players imput caps or items and it requires a verification check/confirmation from both players before trading of items or caps.  Kind of like the vendor screen with a seperate box that both players can see.  If anyone backs out or tries to steal the items return to the appropriate player.
---
Explosive and faster fire are both on the second affix, so they cannot be found together on the same item.
---
This game is a blast.  More content coming soon as well.  You won‚Äôt regret it.
---
No shit, I mean come on.  If you're gonna make a skin that changes the look to the X-01 just make it ONLY for the X-01.
---
Holy fuck.
---
For kill different kind of cryptids? Because it counted as both Flatwoods monster and alien for me
---
If they're 1 star, they're OK I guess.  If they're 2 or 3 star it depends on the other effects they have.
---
Most people here are going to say yes, or biased towards the game still being enjoyable (somewhat) and playable (somewhat) despite the game's bugs, etc.
---
Couldn't agree more, we shouldn't need data mining redditors to cobble together these things (though you guys/gals are awesome).
---
Then again, it's just art imitating life.  The grand consumerist lie, played out in pixel form, that we pay for. They get you to spend your precious caps on shit you don't need with only a vague sense of what it's for, only to rush off to your camp, riding that crescendo of positive buying glee, just to find out making it involves some arcane piece of junk you threw out last week.  So you grind and you junk and you find 9 pieces of aluminum and 3 fiber optics and voila! And after about ten seconds, you realize that this new doo dad is just another hollow piece of kit in your ramshackle hovel, surrounded by mutated monsters in an irradiated hellscape.  And all the people, in all the vaults, they're not rebuilding this world.  They're not accomplishing anything.  Oh sure, you've blown up some deathclaws and beaten enough scorched to call yourself a raider, but who are you really man?  What are we even doing here man?  Why did she open the vault???  We were safe in there man! Damn that Overseer....
---
Servers full most of the time for me and a lot of problems,  major ones, have been fixed since release.   Its pretty enjoyable on my end!  The dlc is dropping regularly so it's as good a time as any to come in.
---
Hmmm...It worked as both for jill different cryptids. I'm not sure about the picture
---
‚ÄúFree Week‚Äù which would include ‚ÄúDouble XP‚Äù on the weekend
---
Oh and give the free players some atoms to spend
---
IMO, I don't understand why it should cost anything.  Isn't the 3-hour cooldown enough?  It doesn't cost anything to do the missile silos and fight the SBQ, which guarantees Legendaries, flux, and a rare goody or two.  Here, you're basically paying 2,000 for the chance at a couple outfits and a standard 3\* Legendary roll you could randomly find just wandering around.
---
Also - to the people who kick off this event while Scorched Earth is going on... *why?*
---
Nevermind. I see he is doing the pictures. Don't see why it would count as both for one and not the other though
---
They could also easily do it with the Bethesda.net launcher on PC
---
Because Beth :)
---
That Dragon is garbage. Save it for the legendary vendor.
---
Hahaha, I'm sure theres a bit more to worry about in the woods with them purdy chin hairs.
---
Yes, I agree
---
Yeah didn‚Äôt work for me last time either
---
anti armor doesnt work properly with energy weapons because it only affects ballistic resistances. the dragon is the worst weapon to have the furious effect on because how long it takes to fire multiple shots
---
Lack of raiders and other npcs is a real bummer but the game is wonderful. If your a fallout fan go into it with an open mind and you will most likely enjoy it
---
Some of his points are incredibly factual, I will give it that, but there are some points he makes simply just to stir the pot. Sometimes, it's not even relevant to the topic at hand in the video. He literally cannot have a single video about FO76 without mentioning some sort of controversy or negative thing because that's what gets him the clicks. As follows is his video structure:
---
mentions topic at hand -&gt; it's good/ok/not good -&gt; mentions what the "community" wants -&gt; if not negetive already, finds negativity to end video on to reaffirm those who turn the game away
---
I'd much rather watch Oxhorn or Kevduit. Both have good FO76 content that is entertaining and not just "news", I'd rather just read the news myself and form my own opinion than have JuiceHead tell me how I should feel about this news. To each their own about what they watch, I will never judge someone based on that, but that is just my opinion on JuiceHead when it comes to his FO76 videos specifically. He has good content sometimes, it's just the content I am interested in that he puts out is not for me.
---
I do this from time to time.  Lost a fair amount of stuff when the person I was using as an anchor server hopped just at the moment I logged off.
---
Not a big deal, just a lesson learned.
---
You do realize other players will sell you serums for like 100-200 caps right??
---
If I had to place money on it, I would say Bethesda will do this at this years E3
---
If the receiver is automatic then you use the commando cards,  if semi auto you use the riflemen cards.  W bloodied build use nerd rage also üí•
---
Maybe 1 day free on on gamepass
---
While nothing is especially "God tier", the laser and gauss rifle could be great for a bit depending on your build. And the furious dragon is a comical weapon to say the least. By the time you have reloaded the weapon the furious effect has worn off.
---
Furious dragon is garbage. An instigating dragon would be amazing.
---
The other two are ok. They are one stars?
---
True that üòÇ
---
Every argument is stupid if you disagree
---
Just spam random players with friend requests.  Someone will eventually agree.
---
30 roast beef steaks and 100 purified water\* attached note reads\* stop feeding him carrots they are poisonous to death claw! -concerned pet owner
---
so many people have alts to store stuff. i can see the need - deep storage you don't necessarily need access to immediately. i've considered this myself, but until now just dealt with packing my 800 and carrying as much as i can.
---
my proposal is a bit different: they could add a mini storage location. somewhere you have to actually go to, to swap stuff in/out of your storage unit. not sure if or how they charge us 'rent' for it, in caps or atoms. but it wouldn't be pay-to-win, it would be pay-to-hoard. heh.
---
I would say you won‚Äôt notice a smaller community playing the game. Always full severs although the PvP survival servers tend to be more quiet they are always full
---
But the online reddit trading community is noticeably smaller from what it was in the start. It can make trading a bit harder but the gameplay is still there imo
---
You can continue to launch nukes without the quest, you just need a keycard and the nuke codes (which are online). I don't have the keycard but as a team, I assume someone else can just use theirs.
---
Our sausages are the WURST!
---
Yeah I have done so before as well - I prefer only moving things I won't really miss if I lose them - the rest I wait for friends to come online.
---
That's fine, I've only done half of one. There's a lot of robots and turrets, defo need to come stocked up with meds and ammo.
---
Focused fire
---
I believe they are 1 stars
---
The shop didn't update with anything last night.  I guess it makes an exception on Tuesdays because they normally expect maintenance.
---
My suggestion is that Bethesda hires an economist because the current economy is FUBAR. There is limited supply and massive demand for high end weapons and armor that has driven the price through the roof. That is coupled with a player cap ceiling making those items unobtainable for all but a handful of players. Anyone just starting better have amazing luck or have multiple cap mules to get anything high end.
---
What‚Äôs the solution?  Don‚Äôt know, but the artificial cap limit isn‚Äôt helping.
---
I'm sorry but how does it make it any longer?
---
There‚Äôs a few locations that event can spawn on the map and a few of them do not work 100% of the time.
---
I obtained the wendigo one by finding a random piece of paper on a table outside of a motel. Southern Belle Motel right above Harpers Ferry. It starts another tiny side quest.  How did someone get the blanket?
---
What version of it does the 
---
Most damage like barbed or the burned
---
Yeah, I noticed that too. I guess I better get motivated to finish this quest. Went to Deathclaw Island and tried just sneaking up on the thing. Guess that doesn't work. Feel like I should probably strip down for this one.
---
Took me 5 characters to get all but Grafton Dam done, and the 5th character got galleria and the asylum.
---
FYI you can only have 5 characters.
---
True, pneumatic over dense removes explosive damage protection, however it removes stagger chance.  Explosive damage can be mitigated with sentinel no?  If you are advocating for stagger(shotgun) or vats crit(rifle) as the ideal way to deal with meta, the explosive damage can be dealt with via perks(Dodgy/Serendipity) or DR since the only good way to deal with a vats crit is stealth. Since the damage maxes out at 190 anyway it doesnt matter how the damage is dealt, unless explosion damage and the bullet are 2 different instances of damage.
---
It's a long-standing bug that the Grognak's Axe can't be over-repaired with Weapon Artisan.
---
It *can*, however, be over-repaired with the Improved Repair Kits the Scorchbeast Queen drops, or from the Atomic Shop.
---
Yeah but clearly that's not always, and in fact as I observe, mostly, the case.
---
Wow... I guess I'm from a different generation.
---
You're saying they should give away money for free.
---
It's hardnened right now, idk if I want to build it to tweaked or not. I mostly use it for scorchbeast. I see people claiming to have the same gun and knock a beast down in a few shots, but idk, I'll reload several times and still not kill it.
---
It's there to comfort you when you realize the vendor ripped you off
---
Well said, yea come in before you miss another event
---
I agree with this.
---
This actually wouldn't surprise me, since that alien challenge is impossible to do, just as the Sheepsquatch was until last Thursday.
---
Anyone else having a glitch where if you have two of the same bobbleheads and a single other, that you use one of the double it changes to the one you had a single for? Had two explosive bobbleheads and one melee. Used the the explosive to take out a bunch of ghouls and the other then changed into a melee so now I have two melee.
---
I've been noticing that happening with a lot of enemies lately, as soon as you kill them their bodies just up and vanish. I had a scorchbeast vanish last week.
---
they haven't fixed this yet?
---
There was a marked circle on my map for the deathclaw that I had to encounter, take a look on yours for one somewhere near Top of the World
---
For my heavy character I use a zealot prime Gatling laser and plasma.  The ultracite for those 2 are pretty easy to snag and it‚Äôs 250 shots or so per core. 
---
Here‚Äôs hoping I have some luck with the purveyor...
---
Honestly I prefer not having a shared stash. My first character was a complete shitshow and the stash of perpetually full, I made a new character and I‚Äôve been way more attentive of my stash and I‚Äôve been able to keep it under 600. If the stash was shared I‚Äôd have to spend hours sorting through everything. Also there‚Äôs weapons and armor that only apply to one character. Maybe just have a separate box that has a smaller capacity to transfer things across characters.
---
Many other games do this. For example, Fortnite. They give free in game money all the time and they still make millions. If anything this would help Fallout 76 by bringing in more daily players.
---
Do you have teslacloils on?  Or did you step on the flowers?
---
if you plan to use it as your main weapon in recommends you to invest into into ammosmith and super duper       im level 106 and i dont have super duper yet and im actually use more ammo thas i can make even if im constantly searching for lead
---
Actually there is no contradictory evidence. We don't know about the customization of backpacks yet, I was speculating that there will be a large amount of customization of the packs available through the atom shop (which you have to admit seems a bit obvious...it's a good cash cow there). 
---
I further speculated that it's possible we'll see some utility items for backpacks (obviously not all per the fridge reference) become available through the shop since they mention them as 'utility items' which is a specific wording they used for the new repair kit.
---
Not really any wild speculation based on zero facts there...and no contradictory evidence.
---
As I said, I'm looking forward to the backpacks and hope they DON'T end up being too heavily into the atom shop (other than customizing looks).
---
You know that post wasn't even all that bad in terms of speculating, I think you might have jumped the gun just a wee bit much in trying to defend there.
---
I went to inspect one closer and accidentally killed it with the disease mutation. Felt like a monster...
---
Really?
---
Possible bug.
---
I've had an Assaultron attack me inside the resort itself for no reason.
---
Absolutely!  If they want to boost revenue, do a free trial guest pass of say, 5 hours gameplay.  This should just be a thing on all games these days.
---
It'll take the weekend to download
---
Thanks I'm on my way there as part of my current quest
---
Sorry to do this to ya but what console are you on?
---
You best believe it, neighbor. I fought two of them 'squatch yesterday, the brahmin were so upset by the fight their milk was curdled
---
Whoops, I got it
---
I thought maybe I had a low latency connection but yeah had the same thing happen when killing ghouls.
---
&gt;I don't need to decide on something I already know. 
---
Doesn't matter. You don't have the authority to deside that.
---
Are you sure they are only ones being "sore".
---
Fully agreed.
---
"Emergency Protocols" tells me absolutely nothing.
---
It's required now for daily/weekly challenges.
---
Of course I'd forget to add that..
---
not that i've heard of, and i follow FO76 news/patch-notes closely
---
Honestly a raider should be disturbing. Like I said, they are the kind of people that will cut someones head off and put it on a pike.
---
Damn
---
Exactly!  Hook line and sinker!
---
Yea
---
It's been better in some ways and worse in others.
---
Is disco ball rare?
---
The fallout 76 trading forum is on the Reddit too 10 most active subreddits. Servers only hold like 20 people at a time, so they always seem full, so it would be hard to notice if the player base dropped. But the community is *very* active.
---
You know, I thought I sees a Squatch 'round about my place the other day. I was just waking up from a Nukashine bender, and went to the window for some air. And when I looked out I saw this ugly critter with the hairiest back you ever saw on a creature in your life! I was just about to reach for the pipe rifle, when I sadly realised it was just the wife wearing a tank top.
---
That might be worse than the open mouth crunchers.
---
Nah, melee will be my main, the handmade is just for scorchbeasts and the random kills that I don't want to run out of my way for.
---
Yup
---
i wish i still had that barrel, karma is awesome
---
It is possible, I would like that though
---
Yes, the game is worth playing!
---
Yeah sometimes its 3* legendary too.. just hop 6 times and your good for a day
---
I have luck at the one near the NAR Repair Yard in Watoga.  I've never had success with the one near the Rusty Pick in the Ash Heap.
---
Really? I haven‚Äôt checked the price in a while.
---
With this games luck a free weekend would result in crashes or something haha - but I‚Äôm down! A sale on Atoms would be nice too.
---
thanks, i was considering ONE ultracite load, and i run a two shot 50 cal and  similar Gatling. Now i know where to invest my ultracite scrap.
---
You can help out and move. It will stay activated as long as you are in the area and don't die. As a lower level that couldn't help much with SS or the lvl 50 adds, I just activated a pylon, continuously popped stims and colas to keep my health/AP up, and sprinted around. I could keep a pylon up for a minute or two this way, and as long as 2 other people are also touching pylons, the higher levels can drop the SS fast. It really only takes 3-5 people who know how to do the pylons, and everyone else can just be an idiot and focus the SS without knowing what to do. 
---
Also, the pylons are covered in electricity the entire time they are activated. It's therefore easy to tell if it needs someone to activate it.
---
I agree
---
Likely, Bethesda is not the greatest when it comes to server maintenance
---
Good on ya for helping the newbies.
---
I'm constantly fighting the urge to crouchwalk over to [my remote coworker's old desk](https://i.imgur.com/b8A8y5L.png) and rummage through it. I swear he left the Pip Boy to mess with my head.
---
I've done the event 6 times and won all 6. I've also always just focused on activating pylons and staying alive. They stay activated as long as you don't die. I've never done any real damage to the SS. 
---
Sometimes you need to be the change you want to see in the world.
---
Bethesda isn‚Äôt the best when it comes to server maintenance
---
No way to say.  But I would day hundreds.   Problem is some of those are locked up on accounts of people who aren‚Äôt currently playing.
---
Yeah. Looks like it's time for an ammo and film run
---
Oh damn that‚Äôs pretty cool! Unfortunate that it‚Äôs one of the animatronic aliens and not the real ones, but still cool and kinda ominous hope they add the zetans in soon
---
With events and new content almost weekly it‚Äôs a good time to join.  Servers are always full. And the community on here has weened out a good chunk of the negative nancy‚Äôs. Is your on PS4 let me know I‚Äôll meet up and give you some loot to get you off your feet.
---
you know where can i find super mutants ? i can't find chickens lmao
---
true the recal card is so expensive thas since the realease of the even i only see it active 20 or so time
---
it's like their deliberately discouraging us from using energy weapons
---
OOh, this I didnt know, thank you for that
---
Had a furious lvl 35 LMG for a while and it was ok until fighting large groups of hostiles. Worked best on scorchebeasts, yoguai, sloths, and any single strong foes. Got rid of it because I didnt like burning through 308 so quickly and that's after my first legendary gatling.
---
But there's a small quest circle at Deathclaw Island as well. I completed the Yao Gui part by using the syringer on the one up by the cemetery in the Toxic Valley, and it seemed to accept it. But I'll do the one you're talking about if needed.
---
It takes money to make money. Sometimes giving away a  little money will make you a lot more money. 10 atoms a day isn't going to earn people much but might keep them engaged in the game. If they keep engaged in teh game they will have chances to see all the new stuff in the atom store and the stuff leaving and get tempted to buy something (which unless they've played a long time those 10 atoms a day won't get them.. and even if they have saved those every day for a long time they'll only be able to get one item and then it is another long period of saving to build up again).
---
I don't deny that, but that little voice comes in so many enticing and lip smacking flavors, I am Odysseus forever drawn to...
---
[The song of the Siren](https://www.sirencraftbrew.com/)
---
Yup it's one of those bugs that annoy me the most. Grinded it off and now I have every mutation except Grounded.. :-)
---
That's my theory too. Though 'everything' becomes easy with such OP weapons and stealthboys.
---
Pain train? Tesla coils? Any other damage aura or mutation?
---
No, I tried this before naming was an option. I'll give it a try later. Maybe it was deploying the same one? It kept resorting it into different positions in my inventory if that's the case.
---
I prefer furious on heavy weapons. Have to be accurate though.
---
It‚Äôs $15 on GameFly I heard.  Used copies at game stop for $29. New is still $55 here.
---
The image on the post is awesome!  Very cool, all the feels!
---
Don‚Äôt *start* none. Won‚Äôt *be* none.
---
215dps on a handmade is more than enough to kill anything big in seconds.
---
When playing with my friend, I will occasionally ask if he is still there as he mutes his mic when hes about to eat something.
---
I run Excav with Bracers, +2 Strength and Calibrated Shocks
---
Also Disease only (Glowing Pastules)
---
The wendigo one can obtained by starting a side quest from reading a piece of paper from a table at the Southern Belle Motel right above Harpers Ferry. It's on the outside bottom table. Same side as a robot that also gives out a daily quest.  I'm assuming the other mounts will be this discovered like this to.  It was extremely easy to miss.  Especially since most of us have been to every location several times already lol.
---
Commando, tank killer, demo expert, adrenaline. If you pvp find some things to kill beforehand and you can get around 80-90 dmg per round fairly quick. My base dmg is 62 but I only have one commando set.
---
Powered Sentinel Assassin BoS Armor with pneumatic, Powerful automatic AAE with vats reduction Handmade, Tank Killer, All three commando perks, Barbarian, Bodyguards, Adamantium, Gunsmith, Class freak, bloody mess, every mutantion (bonus points if a teammate has Empath). 160 damage per shot automatic receiver, 85 drum magazine, over 500+ on DR and ER with almost no chance of being staggered. My only weakness is the AAE plasma Gatling, only seen one player with it and mopped me up.
---
You need only 2 free weekends to play all Fallout 76 content through and see that its not worth of buying.
---
I run Excav with Bracers, +2 Strength and Calibrated Shocks so no also I went through the entrance literally through the checkpoint
---
That's very kind, not too bad for 88, as expected, I can only hope to be playing some version of a Fallout game at that age, unless it comes true O.o
---
I think the general belief is that the .50 is the best, but the Gatling Gun is more ammo-efficient (with more common ammo, to boot) and flexible.
---
Depends on what you consider big, scorchbeasts don't seem to care about it. Takes several reloads to take one of them down.
---
It can be applied to any PA. Also, my friend applied it to his excavator PA just fine...made it look like an  X-01 PA.
---
yeah its an ongoing bug that bethesda has yet to fix or recognize or aknowledge
---
Downvoting people being helpful? Oh dear üòÇ
---
I average around 400 ore per run. Very nice lol
---
Out of the way, near where I was spending most of my time foraging, not too many native creature raids (most bounce off the fence then fall off the cliff), nice view.  Just enough room on the ledge for my shack, workbenches, purifier, and a windmill...eventually made a small adhesive farm.
---
Bonus is its across from an area where I can snipe critters for easy XP.
---
Downside is it is no longer convenient to where I'm exploring, and I'm almost always overencumbered, so cant FT to it...but I have learned where resources/benches are, so I only get back there about once/month.  
---
Which is probably good, since that gives me actual playing time, not optional (countless) hours building and using all those camp item plans I've collected :)
---
Try should also fix where it shows what you get for scrapping it I'm tired of thinking im gonna get aluminum to just end up getting 1 rubber
---
Confirming my experience - it was gone after Flavors.
---
Well I am glad you found your way back to the wasteland!
---
Chin up bud. Its not easy looking after a depandent parent. I guess its how we repay their love to us with our own compassion, empathy and well just being there.
---
I'd say the biggest advantage of the new camera is that you don't get the "Photomode not available here" error when you're in close quarters.
---
I am guessing because they're all passive once you complete the Watoga mayor quest... kind of crazy that people are complaining about it was basically free loot crates hobbling around until you clubbed them. They should have made all of Watoga go aggressive if you attacked one.
---
I never thought of looking up a mine to farm lead ore.  
---
You have saved me from farming Gyms. Have an upvote.
---
Like I said, I‚Äôve had PvP with people in this game where I don‚Äôt walk away thinking they‚Äôre a griefer and I feel like it‚Äôs fantasy in the game. This guy wasn‚Äôt that way at all. Agree to disagree.
---
I'm trying to do a melee -&gt; heavy weapons switch now. Just got tired of standing around with nothing to do when SB/SBQ are airborne, or getting half my health knocked off when I have to charge the Fakesquatch. So far it's not as hard as I thought it'd be since most of the relevant SPECIAL points line up pretty well between the two.
---
There's always 4 or so at the North Kanawha lookout just NE of vault 76.
---
Thank you, it was good to get our team together to watch this nuke landing
---
I threw three frags at ghouls and my game bluescreened lastnight. I've also noticed a lot of shading issues similar to back in November
---
Or they don't own a tesla rifle and are still busy trying to get the rest of their gear than to worry about buying and carrying a lower end gun for the rare chance they are going to be farming at whitespring.
---
The one up near harpers ferry worked once for me and then never again after that.
---
I generally hate the single-platform Dr. Seuss houses, but this one makes more sense structurally and looks like it could actually work. Especially considering the mansions in the Ash Heap, this is an in-game architectural style. 
---
Congratulations for building the only singe-foundation house that I actually like.
---
Right after I started I didn‚Äôt know the mic was always on until you turn it off. Some poor fool had the job of hearing me chewing out my kids for like 10 min before he told me üòÇüòÇüòÇ but dude is lucky your nice not everybody would have been.
---
It isn't about mid fight repairs. It is about being able to repair without uncrouching or leaving power armor. Thus allowing them to repair after fights without having to uncrouch and show up on the map when they are on the leaderboard.
---
It isn't about mid fight repairs, so much as repairing without losing chamelon, or stealth.
---
It is just on the client side, the server will reject the increased damage number and the health of the enemy will bounce back.
---
The game is constantly on sale.
---
Were those people role-playing?
---
what platform are you on?  (I'm PS4)
---
I looted a legendary junkie harpoon gun last night.  
---
Not sure what the effect is, but if you want it, I'm sure we can work out a trade.
---
Ideally, you should sprint in, land a hit, and then plant yourself and don't move unless you have to.  Sprint-attacking an enemy counts as a power attack in melee.
---
Yes, it falls under professional knowledge, as I've said elsewhere I am a former game dev as well that worked at midway games many many years ago.
---
Thank you for the info.
---
Lorespade is actually funny to watch because of his evil laugh
---
I was trading with a guy that had two yesterday.

They're rare, but not extremely rare, just because they were the subject of duping.
---
[](/celestia)Plague Rider says it's only available for 59 more minutes, I'd check after that.
---
Serendipity is a must for bloodied builds if you ask me.
---
So is sentinel nor cavalier better for me? Looks like I'm doing both there
---
What a precious little friend!
---
Also would be nice if players could make alerts of ongoing events. 
---
Sure it opens a lot of problems with idiots, but if we could ping an active event and it would then make server wide alert for it. It would allow players to actively inform others about events.
---
Maybe so that player can ping only once per 10 minutes and only one ping per event per server.
---
Doubt it would end up being a good idea. That would allow people who play the game to create new "free accounts" on that free weekend and abuse dupes and glitches that aren't patched and not fear being banned. Then they would be able to give the dupes to their real accounts without fear of being banned on their mains, only the free throw away accounts.
---
Would be great if you could have a few and had a camp with a pond!
---
Darker nights... yes.  Bright PA light as in the current build... yes. However, Bethesda please diffuse the PA light so it doesn't wash out.
---
Must...get....,AK47....skins...
---
I do that and people get confused.
---
Don't worry there will be people angry at shit bethesda does this patch with stealth nerfs and bugs they add in. I'm sure of it, happens literally every single tuesday at this point.
---
Nerd rage?
---
I like doing this too, sometimes you want to have a relaxed experience in Adventure. Then have more tense encounters in survival, the XP bonus for survival doesn't hurt either.
---
Whole lotta assumption going on.
---
Aren‚Äôt we all?
---
people have been asking for this area to be unCAMPable for a long time, but as usual, Bethesda doesnt listen
---
Yup, already using it.
---
I'm on top the 3 Pilar building south of watoga. Unfortunately you can't fast travel into my camp and there are no resources. Just because I could. Don't know how to post screen captures of Xbox.
---
Rule of thumb: cavaliers for melee, sentinel for ranged.   But weapon weight reduction as a third star can be equally useful.
---
I've been joking for ages about changing to the misc item "token". That being said, I believe there was talk about raising cap limit when player vending drops, but I'm not 100% on that.
---
At least you're honest!
---
I don't know what but you are doing something wrong then. I take them out super quick with a non explosive bloodied handmade with less damage than yours. I use automatic though. Covert operative helps a lot if you sneak.
---
It works 50/50 for me it seems.
---
Only in the sense that we have an avatar in a video game. But it generally takes far mote effort to conciously play a role in the role-playing sense.
---
Most people are just playing the game and there are very few actual roleplayers actively role-playing with the general public out and about.
---
People who deny this is happening to people- THIS IS A BETHEDSA GAME! of course it can happen! bug fixes make more bugs! old bugs come back after new updates!
---
Im not surprised by anything i hear anymore with this game
---
See, what I can't wrap my head around is how such an essential feature (amongst many others!) didn't make it into the game.
---
And quite frankly, I'm running out of possible explanations... 
---
- A simple oversight? *Why don't you change it then?*
---
- Laziness? *Seriously?*
---
- A victim of shifting priorities during development? **
---
Check around sutton.  Lots of critters spawn around there
---
I like this idea a megaton.
---
Didnt go so well last time it was free for the weekend.
---
I could be remembering the wrong quest or bunker, but I thought in the bunker there was an engine or something out of which you could salvage some parts.
---
Agree. I just play the game, have fun, and I don‚Äôt actively ‚Äúrole play‚Äù outside of the base ideas of the game.
---
Things you never thought youd say lol
---
Or 20 copies of exterminators wooden armor when I don‚Äôt use armor lol.
---
Yes you can
---
Yes you can.
---
Gulpers are bullet sponges. Nuff said.
---
Headly.
---
One uranium fever event gets me enough steel to last a while.  I never understood the rationale for lowering the extractors output and maximum accumulation.  There is little competition for workshops anymore.
---
My friends and I actually own it but still dont play it, we tried in on a couple of occasions, just not for us. Not as it is now.
---
Used copies? Do console players not need to set up an account tied to a key?
---
I think you're remembering the wrong quest maybe. Waiting for Bethesda's answer now, hopefully then I'll be able to continue!
---
I lost my X01 chest-piece while I was wearing it in a blast zone. It was there one moment and then my friend was like "Hey your chest is missing." and it was gone - it didn't break - not in my inventory - didn't get removed from the chassis - just gone. It's not recorded because no one is just expecting their items to disappear.
---
Worse case scenario, head down to fort defiance and you'll get the brotherhood quests, which I think the one you're on is sposed to eventually lead you to.
---
Yes this would immediately reveal the infidels from the True Church that be the one of Mothman. Praised be him and his eternal l√§mp that guide us through the wastes safely.
---
of course you second this, you firsted it.
---
Makes me happy to see other people taking the time to line up good shots for the bucket list quest! [I decided on a close-up for mine](https://i.imgur.com/WXRcapS.jpg), but I spent a while wandering around trying to find the best location to shoot from. The camera makes it much easier to take photos on the go, there's so many photo opportunities I've missed because it'd take too long to switch to photo mode; now I can just whip out my camera and snap away!
---
Deff do it.  Way less bugs than at start.  Way cheaper prices than to start. They continue to say there‚Äôs no npcs. But there is.  They‚Äôre just not humans. All the humans are dead. That‚Äôs part of the main story line.   There‚Äôs still bugs. But not game breaking. Some are just funny ones.   They add updates and new content almost weekly.  New events are always fun we just finished a double xp weekend. Shame you missed it that would have been a good way to start out!!  If you‚Äôre on PS4 and get it message me I‚Äôve been creating care packages for new players that just joined us now.
---
This is what I was going to comment. Happens a lot to me in the burrows.
---
No the key is tied to the disc.
---
Maybe I wasn‚Äôt clear. There would be a separate smaller stash that would be shared; as a way to transfer items between accounts.
---
Hmmmm. I‚Äôm not sure then. Those were my hunches.
---
I'm coming!
---
Hi coming, I'm dad!
---
I think they should eliminate the pvp in adventure mode. They could make special events like Monster mash for pvp in adventure but not just like killing anyone whenever. There have been tons of times where I have finished an event (example: Encrypted) and I get killed right after I have picked up tons of steel and lead from all the bots
---
If it's over 10lbs equip it to a spare power frame to save space.
---
I need to know this too.
---
Agree, Bethesda os working good and a Free Weekend Will revive this game.
---
Yep, I switch between jet pack and stealth X-01.  Oh, it also weighs less if you store it on an extra frame.
---
hmm hm hmmhmm hmm hm hmm hm hmmhmm hmm hm hmm hm hmmhmm hmm hm  hmm hmm hmmmmmmmm
---
Guess I'll swap the receiver and see if that makes a difference. I used to take them down pretty fast with my tweaked Tse handmade.
---
*groan*...
---
Good bot
---
I have never once had my camp raided or destroyed, is this even an issue?
---
Are you still in that lobby?
---
I get it. I just want my vault armor upgraded max. Never get stable flux or whatever is was. Also didn't realize till lvl103 I needed to get into a nuked zone. I got 2 yellows I think when in my excavator pa I didn't took rads. Now I do so I didn't go in. Also, I got pvp'ed. And on Xbox hardly ever a nuked launch.
---
Almost like they all came from the same vault or something?
---
I agree! I also always liked the idea of an ‚ÄúEvents Radio‚Äù. A station you can tune to that announces when an event is up. It could get annoying after a bit, but I would definitely listen. Much better than frequently checking the map.
---
They need to fix my lvl 50 trophy bug first.  I really don't feel like leaving my lvl 115 character to build up a lvl 50 character for the trophy to not pop again...
---
Yeah if they dropped it down to a 1000 I would definitely invest
---
The entire thread made my morning ahahahaha
---
Definitely! It's so convenient!
---
I mean I have everything I need but have never received a god tier drop. It‚Äôs just usually when I do put in a bid for the gun I really want, someone usually goes over my 25k limit and bids like 30k. Don‚Äôt really need it but a TSE bloodied flamer would never bore me (lost that one to what ended up being a 75k bid)
---
Idk but I'd rather not have 20 people crowd a pretty easy event. It's not a limited time event and it's not an endgame boss battle.
---
[](/allmybits) I am hoping for more war rider skins myself.
---
I completely agree with making it cheaper to trigger now. With it not being as new, I‚Äôm not seeing near as many join the event and the past couple times I have joined everyone went for the mobs instead of the squatch. Definitely needs to be adjusted.
---
u/ladydevann theyre onto you, get to the border quick!
---

---
If you're in VATS, it simply fills your VATS crit bar and gives you the crit chime. It procs constantly for me when using automatic rifles in VATS. I swap it down to rank one when Im using semi-auto in favor of Crit Savvy, but for full auto FLC is far better.
---
My biggest concern is that its still doesnt change the fact that people can enter survival without caps/aid so there is no reward or incentive for survival as opposed to adventure.  I dont think they will attach level to caps however since that punishes players who would like to migrate back and forth.  Also associating the two makes the survival map strictly pvp, as opposed to what its supposed to be now, a hardcore version of 76.
---
Groovy, thank you for the info
---
When was it free? People couldn't even get refunds lol.
---
Awesome, thanks for the heads up
---
It‚Äôs in the Grahm inventory, I don‚Äôt seek him out or anything but over the course of probably 500 lvls I‚Äôve only seen it once in his inventory.
---
I‚Äôd like this idea for most events in general. I‚Äôd join more events if I knew I wasn‚Äôt the only one participating.
---
Yes, Uranium Fever can be really good if you get a lot of people there for increased spawns. If it's just me it feels really slow unfortunately. Still, you get some black titanium as well which is nice.
---
At the current price, I won't initiate the event unless I recognize several people on the server from previous successful runs. I usually have a recall card on me but I am not using if I can only hope that strangers might be competent. 
---
My strategy is to activate all three pylons then jump on the roof and hit the Impastasquatch and robots from there. If I'm on the ground, the gutsies will team up on me and tear through me faster than I can heal and I don't last one swipe from Squatchy herself.
---
Once I was being hit hard by a pack of gutsies and two PA players jumped on the roof. I thought they were going to protect the conduit and crush the gutsies. No, they just wandered around the roof with their weapons sheathed not contributing one thing to the event. Jokes on them, I stayed alive, killed the gutsies and didn't have any junk on me to drop even if I'd died.
---
Participate in the event people!
---
It gives alot of experience especially to lower levels. As you get higher levels it is simple to find your own resources because enemies arent as big of a threat for you. The Amunition factory is the best to claim because you get lead and junk. And there is silver if you use alot of it. You can level up pretty fast just by claiming workshops.
---
I saw someone do that, I wanted to reward them with a few stimpacks but they walk away.
---
If you're on PS4, I will help you with muling stuff around between characters. I play with a group of people that all help one another with the same thing.
---
No and btw you got two post with same title back to back
---
What level are you? My friends and I kill her often
---
Great thanks for the info. Semi-auto user here
---
I stopped doing it because I was also often the only one activating a pylon. Using all my stims. The white wolf fedora really didn't seem to offset what I put into it.
---
Just checked and yep, thanks!!
---
I like it alot. You can easily move where you need to. Awesome!
---
I got the plans for the X-60 jetpack from the queen the other day, not sure how rare that is.  I am usually out of fusion cores now since they nerfed them so I probably won‚Äôt even craft one.
---
Gaslighting.
---
This is a really cool idea.
---
This is awesome!!
---
Bethesda could saved loads of money on the overinflated advertising budget. They could have used that money on the game. Rented out the Greenbriar, hockey and basketball teams. All of that money could have paid staff to develop the game more. Well oops the consumers can make up I guess right?
---
must. have. all. escavator. colors.
---
Clown daddy is actually kind of funny. His griefing is generally playful in nature.
---
It would be good if all events you've done once will have an entry in the quest tab (sadly not even that works rn correct) of your pip boy where you can select events you're interestet to join and get a notification like Fasnacht etc.
---
Everything you need? Trust me, you don't. Also, the fact that you want a TSE Flamer over BE or FE shows that you probably don't have the best legendaries. There's also armor, which is hard to get a full high-end set of for legendaries. 75k? When was this? That guy's either a moron or only wanted it because it's a legacy item, which is still stupid.
---
There's also keycards, flux, junk, ammo, and so much more, which you can never have enough of.
---
Darn if you were on xbox my squad an I would gladly accept you into our group
---
maybe critters are learning how to block?
---
I've noticed (lately) mole miners sometimes stop swinging and curl up a bit.  like tucking their nose under thair arm and putting an arm over their head....When they do that, my melee swings dont do damage.
---
When they stand up again, my hits register again.
---
This is Vault -Tec speaking, please resume your daily operations.
---
Know what? Yeah hat fave me idea l. I just don‚Äôt have the time to do it though however. There can be a survey created.
---
The app must have glitched out when posting it.
---
That explains why I have so many clipboards on my desk...
---
there needs to be a "shush" emote.
---
Then Crit Savvy is already the better play because its not a "per-shot" proc, it simply changes the way your crit meter behaves. I still keep one rank of FLC just for the chance at filling it right off the rip and then letting Crit Savvy work its magic, but its certainly less useful in that context. 
---
With rank 3 of Crit Savvy, and sufficient Luck stats, you should already being getting to a point in your cycle where you are shooting once or twice between each critical shot in VATS, which is about the best you could hope for with FLC proc'ing constantly anyway.
---
Thank you! Check this one out too! Another one of mine.. [loading screen photo](https://imgur.com/gallery/l196Ta6)
---
Animal themed robots?  What is this Beast Wars? (I am for it!)
---
Wait till Bethesda nerf your build. You get to spend the next 50 levels re specing
---
Still hanging about here, quite a few people still seem to be looking for it so I‚Äôll probably just kick back here for a while longer lol.
---
Not having this is actually why I recently stopped playing for the second time. I just want to make a new character, who can use all the awesome stuff my main has, or can make for them.
---
Bethesda seriously, you are losing players over this, and there's no way it wasn't talked about well before launch, so enough excuses, get it done.
---
During Beta :D
---
Can‚Äôt say I have that experience. I typically unload every grenade I have in my inventory on the queen and I see others doing the same. I‚Äôve never crashed during the queen.
---
times like this im glad voice chat has never worked for me
---
Lolol üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I‚Äôve seen about 75% chance in getting 3 per sbq.  I haven‚Äôt seen them drop from any other in game activity.
---
I‚Äôve never crashed during the queen and I see grenades going off everywhere.
---
A mix.  I run like two pieces of cavalier because that‚Äôs what I have found or can afford. I also run one life saving piece and Mysterious Savior. Those help keep me alive for the most part.
---
I have. It has power armor spawn locations but not armor stands.
---
Look at the sever before you pop it, make sure there is a good number of high levels on it...and hope they come to the event. 
---
I've bought 5 or 6 cards and participated in a dozen or more events with only a couple fails. As someone else posted, if you're holding a pylon, dont respawn as soon as you go down, it'll hold the pylon active for the entire 30 second bleed out!
---
Meh I already have a lvl 100 and a 53 so I've done some respecs a few times already. Moving to a bloody build used so many cards I didn't already have.
---
I think it would be great if were able to select which events we would be notified, similar to how we select and track challenges.
---
The idea is to use a sneaky shotgun build that utilizes Crits as well if Stagger fails.
---
Explosive damage can be mitigated slightly with other perks, but it could be a decisive edge if you combine Crits with shotguns, due to the fact that the pellets don‚Äôt deal the full 190 damage and they count as multiple shots.
---
To be honest, this is the realm of theory. We did not test shotguns extensively.
---
I had one and traded it for 3 awesome legendaries. I traded for one back in January and held on to it. Then Bethesda announced a buff to energy weapons was in the works. As soon as that happened it was worth a mint.  Still have and explosive harpoon gun stashed.
---
As far as i know, you can only see the red dots of things you are in combat with. Since you are not in combat as long as you are not in the danger zone (hence why stealth multiplier still is in effect) there is no way to enable them.
---
Yup full unyielding armor and base luck of 13 gives me plenty of crits with 2* Crit Savvy. Gonna move a point from INT to get 3*, though it prolly doesn't matter all that much
---
\- Events Need Two Things -  
---
1: Events on the Map need to display how much time is left and/or display it in the Pipboy Events Menu.
---
That way you don't jump across the map to an event that only has 10 seconds left, wasting caps.
---
2: Events, in the Pipboy Events Menu, should have the ability to tag an event to give you an alert when its up.
---
That way you don't have Event Alerts popping up on your screen that you might not care about.
---
[](/celestiahappy)Figure the odds are good we're getting War next since it was the only other rider with a splash picture in the last data mine.  
---
I'm still debating getting it. I was going to get Black Rider, but I think my bud is getting that. Then again I'm still pretty happy with Bone Raider Xcavator.
---
I like them all so far. I am a little ambivalent about the fire engine red one though the data miners found. It's literally a reskin. If they remodel the helmet to look like a firefighter helmet and maybe added a fire extinguisher or something to it I would be way more hyped for it.
---
[](/appleroll)
---
Forgot about that
---
I can craft you one. What rank are you so I can make the best one possible. PSN ID is same as this name
---
I have a desk fan... and the screws call to me.
---
Improved repair kits only drop from sbq at thi time. And cannot be bought on the atom store. It was in their patch notes.
---
I will take it if it's still available. Been wanting to get my brother into the game and this would be perfect.
---
Will do if nothing else helps. Found Fort Defiance by accident anyway today so that shouldn't be too hard.
---
This is so aggravating. I just recently modded up a full set of scout armor. I had to buy the mod and then go to the workbench to see what piece of armor I could now attach it to. If I already had that mod then it was just wasted caps.
---
only the queen, not from the impostor sheep squach. IMO they should drop from most bosses (more depending on how long it takes, so the SBQ would give more then the Impostor)
---
Be careful automatic goes through ammo like crazy
---
I've thought this before, especially when the live-action ad came out and one of the actors made a YouTube vid about the experience and claimed the vault suit he wore cost something like 30k? 
---
Marketing is extremely important and a random I teamed up with recently literally did say that ad made him want to get the game, but that's crazy money. I doubt they make 30k in 6 months of atom point sales.
---
Shoot things? Use sentinel armor.
---
Hit things? Use Cavaliers armor.
---
3,5* at night. But my stealth/chameleon doesn't work often.
---
I would imagine you could easily lock down a one shot &gt; Crit cycle with rank three and all that extra luck you're getting from Unyielding.
---
Skyrim was also a single player ARPG. While 76 is a survival game with pvp if you choose to play.
---
I run muted most of the time until I find people to chat with - I'm super paranoid about my own background noise but it seems like most people just... don't care?
---
That reminds me of something that happened the other day.  I fellow was walkin' down the road wearing some odd looking metal armor and carrying a giant sack of something.  Figured he might be a traveling merchant, so rather than shoot him, I waved and invited him over for a beer and talk.  After sharing a pickaxe and chit-chatting for a few I asked him what was in the bag.  He said cheese.  Cheese wheels to be exact.  Hundreds of them.  Said he could survive the rest of his life on them so he was hoarding them for an emergency.  
---
Seemed a bit crazy to me, but if the fellow ain't totally off his rocker, that curdled milk ya got might come in handy.
---
With the introduction of player vending prices will drop, cuz many people dont bother with 3rd party sites like market76, maybe thats all we need right now. We'll see after the 7th.
---
I just jumped in for $30. I think a lot of people have been watching from the sidelines waiting for Bethesda to iron out some issues.
---
It varies and also varies by platform as well. I had it happen twice when I was set up in high traffic areas. Now I'm in the middle of nowhere and never see a soul. If you're anywhere near Whitespring, I can just about guarantee it will happen.
---
I saw a Squach take on a Deathclaw and a troop of super mutants, it wasted them all, and gave me a great advantage when killing it cause they did the bulk of the work.
---
&gt;Did noone playtest 76...?
---
After the camera emote glitch I'm beginning to think this.
---
Yeah. I have aTSE laser too. Absolute beast. Except when there‚Äôs sentinel assassin players.
---
Remember that Vats Crits snipers would mop you up with this combo, along with radiation damage (unstable would increase this intake in theory) They‚Äôre uncommon right now, so you shouldn‚Äôt really worry, but be aware of it.
---
Your combo is near meta, but after using Ass/Sent and Van/Sent, we concluded that Van/Sent is better at keeping the target alive for when those Crits do come. A heavy gun with explosive on it can actually move you if the fire rate is fast enough. Get a buddy in adventure and test it. The explosive bullets will start shifting you (not stagger) with any gun. It‚Äôs very easy to do this on a heavy explosive gun, like the Gatling.
---
Also, kickass weapon and armor set.
---
Yeah, I usually sit on around 10k 5.56,when I was running Tse I was trying to keep 15k around. Before I swap it over I'll make another 10k batch.
---
Might be helpful to others if you name your platform. Also, if you are on PC then mention any mods in use.
---
I agree the system needs to be revamped. As cool as having them follow would be I‚Äôm not sure the game could handle it ‚Äî unless they nerfed the variety of animals you can tame. Or just had dog companions maybe. Deathclaws etc won‚Äôt fit in most indoor locations. 
---
I don‚Äôt mind them being camp decor but they need to apply to the no damage to your camp unless you are hostile to that person rule. Without fail some asswipe shows up and murders my tamed animal and since it can take hours to even get one to have it instantly killed really blows. 
---
Bethesda if you are listening PLEASE make tamed animals TAME aka nonhostile. They just get themselves killed.
---
This game is so much fun. Definately is most fun when you have a team. Message me if you do get it and me and my squad will help you have fun! Lots of quests and events to do. They are always trying to add more stuff to constantly add new stuff.
---
Oh my god yes!!! that would be really cool.
---
Did you get the latest launcher update they dropped?  My game refused to load yesterday until I did.  Even then, I‚Äôve noticed a load of posts with people having similar issues even with the updated launcher.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4
---
60$?? Isn't the game like ¬£7 (~10$) tops right now?
---
I can't say that I 100% have not been attacked by rogues AT ALL - but by and large, I find our fellow wasteland and vault dwellers at least tolerant of me, and often pretty friendly.
---
Thanks man! I decided I‚Äô m definitely getting it. I am on ps4, I‚Äôll shoot you a message when I get it!
---
It didn't give me any tissues tho ü•∫
---
The Watoga train station vendor will have them sometimes. You may need to hop.
---
Nothing.  Nothing will make people play the objective.  So long as there have been online games with a specific goal to achieve, some people are just gonna run around and try to farm kills or raise whatever stats they care about.
---
My friends and I could help you tonight. We were planning on nuking anyway. Message me
---
Yup, it's been broke since beta.
---
Yeah, it's happened to me several times.  However, the worst episode shappened this weekend.  In a battle with a 65 lvl Scorchbeast north of Watoga.  I have him on the ropes with \~10% remaining health.  Server chokes.  I restart the game but now I'm under attack by two 80 lvl Scorchbeasts and my bloody inventory has been scrambled so I can't find Stimpacks.  Somehow, I manage to knock one Scorchbeast out of the sky but before I can get to it, a 65 lvl Scorchbeast pops out of the nearby Scorchhole - then this server chokes.  I restart.  My inventory is still scrambled.  My Scorchbeast kill is gone and two fully charged 80 lvl proceed to beat the living crap out of me until I die.  I respawn, get my stuff back, and find the Scorchbeast I killed but now it's inaccessible/empty.  Worst of all, my inventory stayed scrambled for the next two hours real time.
---
You're correct. As an architect, I find the lack of valley roof sections to be a weird omission, and they make my designs unnecessarily difficult.
---
I have about 25 from Queen fights so far. Seems pretty plentiful.
---
Any plans/recipes learned should be account wide, it just puts you off playing another character if you have to find, and fork out all these caps for plans on every character.
---
I just want at leas fer sure a 2 star drop always man and for the queen a fer sure3 star even if its trash way too many materials amd time for that
---
I am hoping they will introduce item for item trading with player vending.
---
Where was this taken from?
---
Yes...but not very well post January ‚Äúnerf.‚Äù
---
I'm a Mod of the biggest trading subreddit here. We can't even tell people about our subreddit here. If I even mention it, my comment will be removed. If r/fo76 is officially taking this stance, they should probably link users to all actively moderated trading subreddits. There's a sketchy one that is still not completely abandoned. Ours has been consistently ranked top 10 in at least 4 reddit-wide metrics on subredditstats in the past month. It's up to the mod team here, but so far, they've told us we can't even share links linking to our sub. By that definition, most of your post/comments shouldn't be allowed, since they lead to your profile, which may have a post or comment on our sub.
---
**search r/ Morket76 except no space and replace the o with a**
---
Oh no!!! &lt;/3 thats a shattering moment.. I remeber when I accidently killed my Brahmin in a simmilar circumstance, broke my heart.
---
I agree!!! I wish you could pick the events that you like the best to get alerts for like uranium fever, free range, heart of the swamp ect.
---
No, the mentality that rules the game right now and decides the meta is ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt hit what you can‚Äôt see‚Äù
---
Power armor is awful at this task. The damage potential with a good build is utterly massive in terms of players, so power armor would need a huge buff, and sentinel a massive nerf, I‚Äôm talking nuke level stuff.
---
Oh yes! You're totally right. Charming little friend indeed.
---
I heard some dude kicking the shit out of his dog a couple weeks ago. Some chick in the background was egging him on. Just a gentle reminder to me at the time that people can be dirtbags IRL, too.
---
I‚Äôm still missing the one for reviving 20 players.  I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve done that across my account, and on at least 2 characters.
---
Got a bunch from the Queen.
---
I love this idea! This is exactly what I want!!!!
---
I'd reckon the issue is more so with the drive installed in the PS4 at this point versus F76 itself. Can't help you further than that, I don't own any console.
---
cannot say the name as it's auto removed.
---
I gotta admit I've nearly shot your wife a time or two myself.  
---
But any woman that can take down a full grown deathclaw with a machete and cook it up as well as she can is worth her weight in gold.  Plus she did pull my tractor out of the mud the other day, so there is that too.
---
Do you have to enter it when you make an account?
---
Ive worked probably a half dozen or so out of the sheepsquatch sign so far. I applaud all who make the signs that make wastelanders confused in the pants.
---
Thank you thank you thank you
---
Yeah I think you‚Äôre right about that, if settle to have them follow and not be able to enter interiors however, I just want to have a deathclaw buddy to follow me around and spook people with
---
Quality post, good person.
---
All I want is an MMPR themed escavator (i hoard).  Current MMPR armor is nuka t51 torso and head, prototype x01 leg, quantum x01 leg, and black escavator arms.
---
Holy shit, do they really attack you for stepping on the flowers? I've heard the warning, but the only time I notice they're hostile is when I'm farming fusion cores.... which I guess is completely understandable. :)
---
I assume your average survival game spectator doesn't want to watch you survive peacefully, they want to see you profit at the expense of others.
---
I‚Äôm gonna add you tonight if that‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm also having trouble finding people to play with. My psn is Snack_Sabbath
---
Idk if this applies to you but you most likely need to be using a decent Vats Crit build and they‚Äôre probably crippling the SB‚Äôs to get them on the ground, after that yeah 2 hits and a crit will definitely do the job. 
---
Don‚Äôt build a BE build like it‚Äôs just a TSE build with low health, you gotta build a BE for Vats to really be op. If you use an auto receiver (like I do) with a drum mag then you‚Äôll basically have a 5.56 lmg and you‚Äôll be getting Crits in Vats no more than every 3 bullets (at least for me) and if you get into a pinch you can spray to save yourself.
---
At 6 lbs/mininuke and 2 lbs/missile, unless you've got carrying capacity to burn, they're pretty much a waste of space.
---
What do I do if I get error code "CE-34878-0" when trying to play Fallout 76? "Error CE-34878-0" is an error on the PlayStation 4 that can occur due to corrupt data or system software. Press and hold the [PS] button on your controller. Allow the PlayStation 4 to fully power down and wait for 10 to 20 seconds
---
People always seem to leave their patio doors open even though most end gamers have marsupial or jet pack power armorü§´ just jump my way up &amp; I‚Äôm in for the troll lol
---
Yep sbq haven‚Äôt bought any sitting on 21, looks like I can drop 5 points if Int or swap to explosive now for off spec  :)
---
Exactly, you show up to an event of 20+ players, with multiple players over lvl 100 [and a couple over lvl 200]: no one is doing conduit and everyone is wasting their ammo whilst the sheepsquatch is invincible - it's pretty sad, embarrassing, and frustrating...
---
I've seen many player wearing it in the game,I heard it's a rare drop but the person that sold it can craft more.
---
I heard it was out of the Dev room so I scrapped it and now I can make them but I've not done any yet.
---
I run a bloody rifle build and I would lose all the strength and endurance points.  Put them in agility, perception and luck, instead.  Crits and Vats are a great tool to use as a rifle build and like San79no said, serendipity is a must.  I will try to put something together based on the way I run and post it here for you.
---
Maybe that's why they waited so long to deliver that sodding roadmap, because they suspected there would be delays? I was actually shocked they delivered a timetable at the time for that very reason, considering how much people were howling over even the short term intentions they made a week before.
---
I‚Äôm confused in what you‚Äôre asking.  Sounds like it‚Äôs pretty different on pc.
---
Says you I've gotten to New vegas twice without having to go all the way around the map
---
The Lever with gun fu + adrenaline is probably one of the best weapon-perk combos in the game, the Lever Action fire rate is like exactly timed with target switch I feel like a frickin cowboy
---
The pipe isn't double dipping because you made it full auto, and I'm willing to bet you don't have the guerilla and commando perks active. Swap them in and see! The bloodied Tesla rifle would also do better as a full auto, and it's more for when you have a large mob spawn coming after you or want to tag the horde in the Whitesprings clubhouse. Nuka grenades work pretty well for tapping mobs too, I usually throw one upstairs and one downstairs and boom. Half of them are tapped, the other half are dead lol.
---
I'll give this a try, I'll swap it to auto. I'm mostly set up for melee, full strangth and all perks geared towards that, but a couple slots open for some rifle damage.
---
I have too. that's why I said "at the start". you didn't do that on your very first level 2 character now did you?
---
How about a better way to show all active events? Like a navigation bar??
---
No but I did on my second
---
Same with comments, amigo!
---
\^\^ Beat me to the comment! But yes, fully power down your PS4. If you're still having issues after power cycling you may have to contact Sony for troubleshooting.
---
Well, congrats I guess
---
Wait about a month. Player vending will be running by then, as will the legendary vendor.
---
Got loads from doing Scorched Earth.
---
Yup great Ideal I almost just missed one about 10 min ago only 3 of us turned up,made a boo boo I pressed the wrong button and almost killed a cow with my upgraded staff the cow didn't like it much as it chased me around was very funny.
---
Gotta collect 'em all ponymon!
---
[](/flutterball)
---
Sounds good
---
I appreciate the offer, but I'm on PS4.. and you make plenty of valid points. I honestly believed when they added survival mode, naturally they would do some balancing/changes to adventure mode.. then again, I can't believe they let you take everything with you.
---
And honestly, it's my rad shower that pissed me off, I left it stored for fucking ever, and for some reason I decided to place it down yesterday.. gone. 
---
I really hope they get their shit together, this game could finally be going a decent direction, but they still need to make smarter choices.
---
I mean, bloodied with min/max is total overkill in some situations. A lot of the damage just gets wasted lol.
---
I need spandex suits and proper helmets before I make a ranger team...
---
How very British.

The thumbnail pic was taken from the overwatch tower just west of whitesprings watching it get nuked
---
I just took a picture with the camera as son as I stepped out of the elevator and it worked
---
Tbh I run a full unyielding AP refresh set, this will help a lot because you‚Äôll never lose AP, but if you‚Äôre just looking for a weapon to kill big things I recommend ditching the Handmade all together and getting a BE Gatling gun since you‚Äôre already built into strength, you‚Äôd get just as much dps if not more and you won‚Äôt have to change many perks around since I assume you already use PA a little bit. 
---
But if you‚Äôre bent on the Handmade then yeah an auto receiver with a drum mag is mandatory, don‚Äôt worry about armor piercing bc the extra dps will matter more than the little bit of armor ignore especially for the big enemies.
---
I'd like to see how it runs on my ol PS4, and would like to try &amp; get my buddy to play it... Free weekend would facilitate both of these. All for it.
---
My worst common experience with this event is, dying right when they kill it... I respawn, Im not sure if an eyebomb or grenade sent it flying to the body but, the body is not there - that's usually always a group of players in the area searching for it. I already lost count on how many times I completed the event without finding the body...
---
It keeps super mutants and scorched from walking inside , most of the time. Forcing them to stay outside and in line of fire with turrets.
---
They didn't do this themselves, and no they aren't a real life friend, just someone I met playing a different game.. but someone I played with long enough that they damn well know my character and could have vouched for me, possibly avoided this petty scenario from happening, or at least diffused it.
---
I have 2 unyeilding pieces, having trouble finding other pieces that I need, I primarily use PA with protocols, without PA I'm a wet noodle except in the forest. I have a hunters explosive that I use for qieen runs. I really like the handmade, it is a fun gun, just want to drop scorchbeasts like I used to. When they hit the ground and the sledge comes out its 2 hits and done.
---
I went on google and copy and paste lol
---
That would be awesome if they can make it happen I‚Äôm on board... I love having deathclaws at my camp!
---
that you know of
---
Haven't had this happen but have had my PC crash twice while I was in the Burrows during Nukapalooza.  Both times it happened less than a minute following the explosion.
---
Ill be there in a little over two weeks, so excited!
---
Weeklies have ended, so it wouldn‚Äôt matter
---
Two Suns in the Sunset...
---
You may have accidentally hit one you didn't see with pain train.
---
Absolutely, also shouldnt give any warning when you cut the wrong wire so theres no fast travelling away, just boom
---
I would personally run something like this, there is plenty of room for adjustments for personal preference here.  The strength perk doesn't matter that much, but you want something for weight.  I would definitly get 4 unyielding armor and 1 chameleon piece as soon as possible.  Also, deep pockets.  This will mitigate that low strength.  I can carry over 300 lbs even with that 1 strength, between the unyielding, deep pockets, and radicool perk.

---
300 lbs is 136.2 kg
---
Yep this is a big problem. Last 4-5 times I‚Äôve done this event it failed because only a couple people were triggering the pylons and some were just standing around.
---
I cant recall all of mine but I know vallery galeria was definitely one, as was the Cranberry Glade. I'll have to check for grafton dam

---
England may be part of the continent of Europe but we have much better queuing etiquette than those mainland Europeans! 
---
*(An Englishman who has lived in other European countries)*
---
Activate the pylons, jump on the roof, take a shot or two at the imposter and stim. Let everyone else do their part, it's not that complicated to stay alive as a conduit. Maybe people don't know you can jump up on the mattresses on the side of the building to get on the roof without marsupial.
---
Part time runner here.  The most boring part of this is collecting cards(in my op). You tend to have 4 people on 4 different servers who shoot down the card holders and then as many volunteers as possible load into the server, open the chest, loot the chest, and then jump to the next server. Then all the cards are collected on one person and run (More often over weight) the cards down to one person who's entire job is to go down a list of 2k+ possible words based on the fact that the words for nukes can be some where between 8 to 11 or so letters. If it was random That list would be impossible to crack. Anyway, the poor sap who has this job works with 1- 2 code counters who make sure this poor sap who is putting in a card, turning to the key pad, and punching these codes in doesn't mistakenly do the same code twice because 300 cards is not enough sometimes to finish a silo. Sometimes you finish it 4th try, sometimes you finish it on Wednesday when we are given the first letter of the code and thus the choices become slightly better.  
---
It is boring, it reward is seeing confused people show up to fight whatever you nuke, and being able to throw all the extra cards into next weeks nuke solving pile because again... collecting cards is a boring pain in the ass. But we got nothing
---
Badum tsss
---
*Sully groan
---
Just came to say I love your name username :) sucks your not on xbox, I've got a ton of mods I don't use :(
---
This is a better idea. Especially with a game as a "service". Instead of always changing the code of a game to keep up with the latest quests/events, code it once to give us the option to select which events from a list we want to be notified about.
---
Additionally, maybe even a proximity notification for when we are roaming and don't care for a specific event but will join one once it pops up nearby.
---
I want the game to make a good impression on new players. Whats wrong with that? On Xbox One X and I hit a forever loading screen so many times in the encryptid event after dieing I've actually missed out 4 times in a row of getting rewards for event completion and even the dead body of sheepquash was lost but oddly still saw the regular dead bodies of adds I killed. If this happened to me on any game I was thinking of buying I wouldn't buy it.
---
Ive been zetan in my garden all afternoon
---
[](/kcelestiacute)Oh man, I don't atom to collect them all, but I would if I could.  
---
Altho speaking of collecting I did see that they were talking about adding junk items to camps as decor, I can't wait to have my Giddyup Buttercup ~~herd~~ ~~Army~~ ~~horde~~ collection ready to greet my visitors.  
---
Speaking of, I wouldn't mind them recycling that horse power armor from 4.
---
The real question is why lead comes from lifting weights in the first place.
---
The camera should help with that now? I haven‚Äôt tried it yet since cameras were out simply because I haven‚Äôt had a successful run/haven‚Äôt lost the body yet.
---
Nice! Well played.. well played indeed,
---
I launched the event last night and had to 3* Gutsy's spawn + the Sheepsquatch. I got 3 1* legendaries and a white fadora hat.
---
I don't know what the development team is thinking but I constantly find myself saying......"f#&amp;* this game". Being stingy with loot drops is only going to keep people playing this game until something new comes out. My guess is that Borderlands will be the FO76 killer.
---
A wave of bullets! Haha welcome back

Nope, just picky redditors, i tend to just be happy tgeres someone else to speak with instead of just thumbs up or wave

Floating ceilings is also a design term for ceilings that are below the actual structure of the ceiling.

Do you have ranks in sneak? Stealth commando is what you're looking for. You should be able to kill a SB in less then a clip with tank killer, sneak 3 and covert operative with a perforating magazine. The trick is to take potshots at the SB while it's flying around and after it lands to unload a clip into it while either hidden or in caution. Having some points in Adrenaline really helps to because you can get yourself bonus damage by killing the scorched that come around with the SB.
---
Scorched earth event drops them. Did 2 at the weekend, now have 5 of these improved repair kits.
---
&gt;  I‚Äôve been saying for years, start creating adventure companies. Ski, fishing, hunting, based jump from the new river gorge. 
---
All of that already exists.  We have ski resorts (I believe Top of the World is based very loosely on Snowshoe Mountain), Bridge Day (base jumping from the Gorge bridge), Whitewater rafting companies, ATV adventure companies, hunting/fishing everywhere, etc. etc.  
---
From talking to non-residents about their vacations here, I think the problem is not a lack of outdoor/adventure opportunities.  It's what else they see when they're here.  The culture can be pretty backward, the level of poverty can be shocking to some, and if you're into the arts the pickings are slim.  It makes people not want to come back. 
---
 WV needs to get away from the "Coal and Guns and God are all we need" mindset and join the 20th century before everyone else is in the 22nd.
---
Marijuana tourism could be a big boost to us, but our leaders on both sides of the aisle are beholden to corporate interests and stuck in the past.  We'll legalize it once there's no advantage over other states, because they will all have made it legal already.
---
Good to know. Thanks.
---
My character I was playing during fasnacht got corrupted, RIP my parade plans
---
True, not sure how it works but, I'm not sure of I can snap a pic while my dead body is flying around üòÖ
---
Sorry you had to hear that. People are fucking losers sometimes.
---
I still have nightmares from seeing a poor protectron crawling along the ground with his hands dragging his broken legs behind him from fighting scorched. It was so sad, he even said 'have a nice day'. I wanted to pick him up and keep him.
---
Cavalier is going to be great for 2 kinds of people, Punchy and snipers who have to run away as fast as they can.
---
Yes we need events going up to alert the players, would love it as it would let us know without us checking the entire map.
---
Genuinely asking.. How do I tell if it's vulnerable/invincible. I know it tells you in the upper right corner, but I assume there's a different way to tell?  I've only joined the event twice now, but haven't been able to figure it out yet.
---
Thank you
---
I would love to tag events that I love Watoga High school one but nowadays it spawns randomly since everyone farming exp ran it.
---
Hahaha cheers ‚úå
---
I see where your coming from, but its supposed to be a different character altogether, same with all these requests of shared STASH, the other characters arent supposed to be mules theyre supposed to be seperate, so for instance i can have a character and my wife can have a different character on the same account
---
Yes, just make a torso with the auto stim and swap it over as required. 
---
I've done this with my t60. Got the jet pack but I dont want to have it all the time. What I've done is simply got 2 sets one normal one with jetpack.
---
Ok, that makes sense, I got 2 disco ball plans from him.  But I logged off and back on with same Grahm (someone was holding him) 5 times and got the plans twice, so assumed it was not rare.
---
I do this as well so I just wear my thumbs up vault boy shirt and just point to it so they get a vault boy image as well
---
Same here, first time saw "sheepsquatch attack" on April 13. Found date because I sent a message for my friend about it
---
what truck?
---
Found the Brit.
---
Image?
---
I almost though this was a bot.
---
No don't get me wrong -I like to talk to people too - just don't wanna hear your screaming 5 year old~
---
Yeah, assuming I know someone who already obtained said recipe which is now 25k caps. If they implement player vending eventually then it's not a problem as much
---
It is the best lol
---
I am on PC, it does pop up. I was in the mire doing Free range and the Encrypted pop up came on my screen.
---
Isn't that a good thing?
---
I have that, did not see a connector like that
---
Thats fair, but this is an extremely snall minority of people, also i can tell you as the dad of an autistic 4 year old, i also dont want to hear him screaming
---
buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut you come to the reddit page for a game you dont play?
---
How is it initiated??
---
I was walking through a store cuz my daughter needed paper and I seen an entire case of clip boards and literally said "damn that's a lot of springs"
---
What if you don't have friends?
---
Yeah agree... this is annoying AF. Especially when they have generic names like "bladed" .... bladed what...for what weapon lol .... and what does said mod add to said weapon
---
I‚Äôm the same way. And even if I‚Äôm with people it‚Äôs muted until I need to talk. If my wife or son starts talking while I‚Äôm talking I mute immediately. Just paranoid about it. If I‚Äôm about to eat or drink something I‚Äôll let whoever I‚Äôm with know I‚Äôm putting it on mute so I can drink or snack. Iv caught my self asking for help or asking a question only to realize it‚Äôs still muted. Better safe than sorry
---
if it doesnt happen to ElJefero, it doesnt happen to anyone, anywhere, ever
---
There are only like two servers at anytime, it‚Äôs not worth playing survival
---
if you wanna sprint somewhere quickly, yes. downsides may include being flung in the opposite direction
---
I cant access the site from where I am, so my 02 on where I put my some of my points and why.
---
I'm 1H Melee build, solo most of the time, and in unmodded  excavator L45 b/c I'm overencumbered.
---
Str maxed at 15.
---
Glowsight3 very useful in nuke zones, incisor3, martial arts2 and a ninja.  (increase swing speed), blood mess3, tenderizer1 (I would put 2 in tenderizer, but I dont have enough charisma points).
---
You will take rads, so (at least) one point in ghouish.
---
1 point in fireproof, which mitigates some SB sonic attack.
---
3 points in automatic rifle perks for accuracy and armor penetration.  I use a 1\* executioners combat rifle most of the time.
---
As long as I have a place to duck and cover (deflect/block some of the sonic attack) the executioners rifle will take down a L50 SB.  Hip fire, so I miss some.  Running solo, I'm averaging a tad over 200 shots to take out both the accompanying scorched and the SB itself, less if it lands. 
---
If SB lands, I have a non-legendary L45 cultist dagger that does a respectable amount of damage in a very short amount of time. 
---
AA grognak axe takes 2 hits for a L62 glowing one.  Cultist blade takes 5, but does those 5 faster than the grognak does 2)
---
The highest level critter I've taken out with the dagger was a L91 glowing deathclaw.
---
Alternately, I've got a couple good vampire weapons - might take a couple more swings, but I get some health back in the process.
---
It's because everyone else kills the ss before I can land a hit. Happened to me twice.
---
Critical shots heal you and your team.
---
I did say it was long. Though I am disappointed that it was downvoted to 0 after I spent a few hours on this to help everyone. Not because of karma, but for visibility
---
The poverty is astounding. It‚Äôs awful and it‚Äôs completely ignored, or unknown. I‚Äôm related to half that damn state. It‚Äôs even in my family. There‚Äôs the rich ones (piedmont and my people) and the poor ones (mountain). I didn‚Äôt understand dirt poor until I spent summers with them. 
---
My brother was in Lewisburg for awhile. Such a cool little town up there in the mountains. There was a ton of art there. 
---
Also, a plug for anyone reading this: Canaan Valley is amazing. Also, I‚Äôve backpacked Spruce Knob and it‚Äôs such an empty, beautiful area. Go visit! Also the New River Gorge. And visit Dolly Sods (it‚Äôs an actual cranberry bog on top of a plateau that‚Äôs still the same Taiga Forest it was during the last ice age. Well, that‚Äôs the entire Monongahela plateau. I kept expecting a moose to show up when I‚Äôve been up there. 
---
Also West Virginia has its own wolf. (Eastern Red Wolf)
---
Legalize weed, throw money at tourism (which puts people to work). Court the shit out of them. It‚Äôs such a pretty, wild place and I wish others could see it. Plus the people are alright once you get to know them, just standoffish initially. Be polite and show respect and most folks will be friendly enough. 
---
Also I know it was offensive, but I don‚Äôt think investing in tech, including learning to code, is that bad of an idea.
---
Which should give people a more post apocalyptic vibe when playing because theyre so used to light nights then suddenly they get hit with reality
---
550+ hours and still finding new and interesting things in the WV wasteland and the multiplayer asspect is amazing. Most people disagree but personally this is my favorite fallout experience ever. Even when the game was more broken and now its so much is better and working

Its at 76, i caught a newbie coming out and got the at 76 and under 10 in one go
---
Anti armor is good for lower damage weapons , like the minigun and LMG, and furious is about as good. Furious requires you to hit the same target within a ten second window, and missed shots don‚Äôt reset the damage, only hitting a different target resets the damage. Faster fire rate is better than explosive because it increases the chance for one gun army to activate, which either cripples a limb or staggers. Reduced weight or faster reload are best third effects. Bloodied outperforms every other modifier when at less than 60% health, and synergies with nerd rage, bolstering, unyielding, serendipity, and adrenal reaction, making it very overpowered.
---
Yes, that part understand. But what does it heal?
---
If it's stealthed/invisible, it cannot be harmed. Once all three pylons have a player conduit, that vulnerable message pops up. Lately though I've been seeing the message with only 1 or 2 conduits active, my assumption is some kind of lag in the message display
---
Okay so bad translated!
---
Congrats to you!
---
I snapped two guys (Level 8 and Level 50+ with PA) and got 3 done in 1 snap
---
I disagree. We already have shared items across characters anyway with the Atom store items - it's an established convention within the game already. 
---
I do think some recipes should still be behind progression (decon arch, or example) - but it's not unreasonable to expect shared plans across characters, again, considering that already have it to an extent anyway.  
---
WoW does this pretty well with their toybox, pets and mounts.
---
Flair checks out!
---
Thanks, that‚Äôs actually pretty decent. I‚Äôve seen people get some nice dmg out of junkies.
---
Fallout needs a grandma streamer.
---
Atom shop items are different since in theory they are paid for with real money so are essentially extra purchases to that game so would carry between characters
---
Oh. I just had the NAR Repair Yard one fail this weekend. There were four or five of us taking turns trying it without luck.
---
My brain has just led me to the wasteland full monty.
---
Trying to think back to when missiles killed things in less than four hits... FO2?
---
These seems to stack like the 'level three times' challenge btw. I got 3 with one picture of a person.
---
"Well...there goes the neighbourhood. Again."
---
yeah i agree. might just muddle things like the encryptid. massive FR drops, increased chance of DC.
---
&gt; you know where can i find super mutants ?
---
Have you even played the game yet?!
---
Is this the one with the hat in the back of the dump truck? In that bad bit of road outside Lewisburg?
---
Only need 2800 atoms for the two limited time power armor paints...
---
Damn why do they seriously have to be so expensive? 
---
5 bucks seems extremely reasonable for a skin and i bet they would sale more than 3xs as many
---
Um, yes. What have you been doing with your excess legendary stuff all this time?
---
Just make sure to have a few in inventory.   That way you just need to try again.    I think that I‚Äôll start brewing more of the stuff just to save travel caps....
---
Your stash might vary, but I wouldn't even save something that heavy with only one star.
---
thanks i missed that post
---
Two Shot Medic? Your weapon has two primary legendary effects?
---
Sorry double barrel ....
---
nukashine is up today as well
---
so that's 4200 if you want that one too
---
Of course mike!
---
Thanks! This has been a really nice experience, another user crafted one for me and now my devilish looking ensemble is almost complete. We may be on different platforms but we're all in this together!
---
Now to continue selling exceptional TSE weapons to players for 666 caps and letting them know I'll call a favor in some day... &gt;:]
---
Demo expert is not worth it for the explosive legendary effect.
---
This guy hooked me up. He is dope.
---
yeah they should add weapons levels which would make a lot of the duped weapons less appealing
---
Because there are dedicated Subs to trading.
---
let me phrase this so you can understand it:
---
Yeas this iz nohrmall the charmed feral gouls do this sumtihmes
---
I'm on ps4 if thats cool with you?
---
Would it not make it stronger?
---
that's a pretty good sum up of how it really is which is why it isn't for the weak right???!!!  I somehow oddly enough enjoy it but i'm a weirdo! lol
---
Hello..
---
&gt;FREE ITEMS
---
&gt;We‚Äôre offering a free Gift Emote that you can use let other Dwellers know when you‚Äôre feeling generous. The addition of a Gift Emote has been one of the most common Emote requests we‚Äôve seen from the Fallout 76 community, and we‚Äôre excited share it with you.
---
&gt;Additionally, we‚Äôre introducing the Punch Bowl to the Atomic Shop for free. Build a Punch Bowl in your C.A.M.P., and then pour in your favorite liquor to share it with any thirsty visitors who drop by.
---
&gt;Unlike previous free items, the Gift Emote and Punch Bowl will not leave the Shop at the end of this week, and we do not currently have an end-date planned for these two items.
---
I was in a team with a couple last night during SBQ who were being way too affectionate on the mic. It was awkward to say the least
---
It actually goes invisible (like the perk).  If you can see the distorton which is kind of a pain in the arse.  Not sure why it's doing this though...
---
Got three characters filled with legendaries. One for multistar items, one for single star weapons and one for single star armor.
---
Exactly. I've done the one in the mire solo and it was fine. It's a 5 person event max. Otherwise you have to actively get a shot at the sheepsquatch at the end before it gets blasted away in seconds.
---
Nukashine today? Score!
---
And still no fix for the bugged out nuka shine quest
---
1400x2  = 2800
---
Must be EU servers üá¨üáß
---
ok thanks i will let it sit next time
---
Literally gave up on trying to find the armor I want, physically impossible due to RNG, myself nor anyone else ever finds the 3\* + armor type combinations. Hoping the Legendary vendor will allow me to make it. (and Bethesda still does nothing to support us players who use armor over PA even though its the rarest most prized thing on earth)
---
I typically run either muted or without any sound/mic unless I'm playing with friends - then I use push to talk. I personally enjoy hearing a wife or mother going off on someone about them spending all their time playing games, but I hate hearing the heavy nose breathers and chip eaters. :)
---
Not allowed to post the name of the big one here, as the mods from there and here do not get along and the second biggest is pretty much an un-moderated mess imo
---
Such a nice thought, real life does get in the way of our wasteland wanderings but that's how it should be I guess.
---
The absence will make my return all the sweeter. :)
---
Where‚Äôs my Handmade skin?!
---
Slightly but you can get better damage perks in other categories. The guy said he gets 62 damage. With 5 points in demo expert it will probably go up to 68 or 70.
---
Absolutely, I'm lucky to have two siblings so we share the care :)
---
my frame rate is the same it's like being back in the beta
---
In reverse, I saw a globe the other day and thought, "ah yeah I need some screws" 
---
I felt stupid about it until my wife says she mentally collects woodpiles when she sees them IRL.
---
I have one. I got it off a high level player, said "it's from the Beta" ...he told me if I scrap it he guarantees I'll get the plan but I'm too scared to, haha. I have him in my friends list and I often check to see if he's on so I can scrap it but he has only been on once since and the list was bugged out, said we weren't in same world :(
---
Where is the truck located? Inquisitive minds want to know...
---
About time.
---
Someone made a power armor guide, and it saves my life. I hate that they don‚Äôt tell you before you buy, with how expensive they are
---
plus 1400 for the next horseman
---
and the next, my brain farted and I forgot there were 4.
---
so it's 5600 for war, nukashine, famine and death.
---
i've had the thing
---
Each is 1400
---
Yeah why is that strange to you?  I‚Äôm subbed as I own the game and follow the updates.
---
Some bastard came up with the heart emoji and I waved and went back to crafting and they shot me in the back. ya yellowbelly.
---
don't forget about death and famine though. so that's another 2800.
---
Anyone know whats in the Brew-Haha bundle
---
Punch bowl is under misc. structures btw. 
---
Seems pretty cool, you can put alcohol into it and I'm hoping other players can access it.
---
Nope. Using a stabilized 10mm while I amass a good amount of .44 for my single action later.
---
I've been doing this since the nukashine release, I've been over-encumbered for 3-4 months now n it's an exelent way to fast travel
---
it's just a theory but it can't be helping the servers and explosives don't do much damage to the queen anyway
---
Also he is only getting 62 with demo on. The best way to test this is to put the perk card on and off.
---
id wait till it goes down to $12.99
---
It does say everything in the event header 5 items 5 pics so id assume so
---
FORREAL
---
&gt; Edit: War Rider Has Arrived! along with a lot of cool Nukashine stuff including a new PA paint.
---
Wow. Anything on a shorter time limit than a week? I'm out of town for a few more days...
---
Ok, how long should it take? I can only play for an hour or so in the evening  (I'm on the east coast).
---
Would Saturday be better? 
---
There an update to the shop items. 2 free items and new PA skins
---
Agreed, I think it‚Äôs a great idea.
---
If you need steel I recommend going to grafton steel and killing the super mutants and then taking all of their weapons and equip the scrapper perk, and then scrap it. You get like 200-250 steel
---
It is, but I like to tell people that fallout 76 is like a survival game.
---
My bad,  I just figured they left the excavator and ultracite out of the new paint fun like they used to.
---
It's claimed boys
---
Less annoying, buy more useful &gt;.&gt;
---
By walking up to one of the areas where it triggers, assuming it hasn‚Äôt already been done on that server earlier.
---
$14 for a paint is ridiculous considering you can only use 1 at a time.
---
Do we need support? Or an appreciation society?
---
TSE weapons are high in damage and great for general use. The down side to heavy TSE weapons is they take a lot of card slots to keep happy and high damage. They all tend to be linked to power armor and thus having a high INT works best with them. 
---
Anti armor Weapons are also great over all general use. The down side to them is on lower armor creatures you won't be dealing a great deal more damage, however, using cards and the weapon will ignore some 80%+ armor on any creature and you wont notice this damage drop because chances are whatever you were shooting at is going to be dead anyway.
---
So it comes down to what you want to use and the weapons over all strong points and weaknesses.
---
Gatling guns hit hard, have easy to control spread even as two shot,  and easy management of ammo. They suffer from condition management and poor use on close encounter creatures but, then again all Explosive weapons suffer from this so it just adds more hurt to the weapons use if anything gets close to you.
---
Minigun's have a spin up, spray bullets everywhere, are great for large mobs where aiming isn't the goal and laying down blankets of exploding death and keeping control of big baddies. They suffer from eating ammo like a hotdog championship eater. They will eat 10k rounds and leave you wondering wtf happen to it.
---
50cal's are the more popular option because they have no spin up, great hitting power, and the 250 round clip can be easily managed. The downside is finding this ammo in large amounts and you will thus find yourself crafting lots of it before going out. Otherwise, they are great.
---
Last and possibly my favorite next to the 50cal, is the MG42. It has a small clip of 75, crafting ammo is a lot of clicking, and it will eat all that ammo in that clip if you so much as sneeze on the trigger. All of this, however,  can be forgiven when you see the damage, rate of fire, and the insane control you can have on the weapon when aiming and burst firing. Even as a TSE this weapon has laser accuracy and in pvp it will chew most people apart because of its insane hale of bullets.
---
Over all I would say find a good 50cal or one of the top two and use them for different walks of combat. 
---
Any of these weapons as anti armor will work great also.
---
what other game subs do you lurk that you dont think the game is for you and you dont play?
---
They added a new emote?
---
I paid a LOT for the PA edition, but agree to this. I also bought a second account for ¬£9 from cdkeys for mule-ing. Not a bad price now?
---
Add in Gun-fu and Adrenaline from Agility and that's my build :) Crit every 2ish shots.
---
Depending on player level, and how many, could breeze it in a tight 20. I'm EU myself and am available most of the time
---
How are you dying with pacifist on?
---
Yea. No one plays that mode whatsoever. Hardly anyone even played it before survival mode came out. So everyone gets locked out of those atoms.
---
Trading sub mod here. I think this is a good change, but as we like to remind people, we're not allowed to mention Morket 76 here without automod removal. I hope the mods here will reconsider their decision to exclude mention of our trading sub in this post and this subreddit. 
---
We're making some big changes so you all can group easier and trade with more accountability!
---
How do you know to message other players then? Is there a holding period at the start?
---
It's all part of their scummy marketing strategy. Unlike most games that are literally free to own, and play, that survive off having a good cash shop, someone over at Bethesda is just tossing all sorts of crap in this shop, and complaining that they are having "losses" so they can justify what's to come. Strange how they "nerfed" all durability, and repair cost perks before selling repair kits, and how food seems to degrade super fast now, and we know for a fact they are adding a refrigerator to the cash shop isn't it? Almost like they are low key scumbagging the game so we are forced to spend even more of our money on a game many of us already spent at least $60 on? This is not the future of games, this is the death of gaming.
---
dont act like such MoOk
---
But today we only need to spend the 2800+700 for that bar set :D Hurts a lot but it could be worse...
---
It needs a fee weekend AND the ability to download that free weekend version the week prior.
---
That way people can start the download and have it done and set with plenty of time to spare.
---
I don‚Äôt understand people who even look at weapon damage. The only things that matter are level, weapon type, and legendary effects. Know those base categories. The listed damage is meaningless.
---
I‚Äôm really disappointed I didn‚Äôt get to get the Raider skull excavator armor. Hopefully it‚Äôll come back around. You would think if they kept them on the store, people, including myself, would definitely purchase them.
---
Looks like I am going to need to buy some atoms for those 2 skins. they are way to sexy to pass up
---
...hmm
---
This needs to be tested immediately - if that's true, AND other people can access it, it a game changer (at least the beginning of one).
---
One doesn‚Äôt have to be playing a game on a daily basis to be subbed to it on Reddit. I‚Äôm following updates and waiting for the right time to play. What exactly is so difficult to understand? 
---
Or does someone saying he doesn‚Äôt play this game but a nerve?
---
Still there?
---
On the PC you use the key provided to make an account. After that the key is consumed as it is tied to a person. You may be able to resell the disk but I have a hunch that the account key has been consumed in the same manner as other online games, so the physical disc is useless
---
Yaaaaaa no more running around shooting at your bag when you‚Äôre just trying to be a nice guy.
---
&gt;The addition of a Gift Emote has been one of the most common Emote requests we‚Äôve seen from the Fallout 76 community
---
They do listen!  (at least to some things, but it's a great gesture no matter what).
---
This is awesome!!!
---
Technically a BE Gatling gun has higher damage potential (with demo expert) and more ammo efficiency, but the 25% fire rate legendary (combined with a speedy receiver) puts the gun at a fire rate that ‚Äúfeels good‚Äù. I‚Äôm looking for a B25 Gatling gun and a BE 50cal
---
As a Brit, this sounds kinda fun to be honest...
---
Maybe it's just the surreal idea that even in a videogame, we queue.
---
Yeah i didn't really care for the 1st one so im not worried about the whole set tho i think the death one is gonna be bad ass hopefully
---
If you need to ask then no.
---
Prime Rib Day was just on Saturday.
---
It's the missing girl's quest you can get from the taxidermy office in the Room with the terminal upstairs. I have all those ones I was just hoping that something new dropped today because as far as I know nothing has dropped since the wendigo
---
Please. Go play another game.  
---
Nobody is forcing you to spend anything. 
---
Play somewhere else, or stop whining.
---
Just remove caps entirely from adventure mode PvP unless it‚Äôs a Wanted bounty.
---
That would be far, far too much work to implement
---
I was at work and talking about taking a picture, and I found myself making the Victory Squared pose without even thinking about it.
---
I tried this other day with a level 10 and he had no idea what I was doing and just kept looking at me. This will help with that.
---
Awesome!
---
Hate to be a stickler on this one but a "legacy" TSE flamer or a Bloodied flamer...cant be both
---
Free weekends AND starter packs:
---
5 stimpaks
---
5 purified water
---
5 disease cure
---
5 water purifiers
---
double barrel shotgun
---
50 shotgun shells
---
starter armor pieces.
---
When was the punch bowl added for free?
---
Usually I am all about free stuff but somehow missed that
---
I too wish to have a sleeping bag on the floor surrounded by mecha pones.
---
[](/ppseesyou)
---
People don't like playing PVP mode in a game that is woefully unbalanced for PVP and has auto-aim? I'm shocked.
---
Heavy weapon.
---
I think today
---
The notes say right in them that you can put drinks in there and others can access them.
---
That's kind of annoying... Having god-level perception is kind of pointless if you're only aware of enemies as they're actively trying to kill you. I want a "Mob XP- this way!" flag on my compass like we have for quests. Maybe I'm misremembering, but wasn't that how it worked in FO4?
---
even though it might, look towards how much good it might just do to the game. I‚Äôm not a developer and don‚Äôt know how the creation engine and coding in it even works, but if i was a developer then i‚Äôd take all that time to adjust that into the game.
---
&gt;"russian roulette"(dont knwo if it's a common term in english - in german it is)
---
Nope, you got it exactly right, it is a common English term, and your suggestion fits the idea perfectly!
---
I just had it happen to a level 4 in flatwoods, wanted to get rid of all my 10mm and 38 rounds, threw in some Bobby pins and a few aid items only for them to just look at me like I‚Äôm an idiot shooting at my bag.
---
Was the best, new skin out now!!! So good!
---
.... your health.
---
Its a dummy and the pic is floating around here somewhere.  (Didn‚Äôt count for the atoms challenge.)
---
But I look at money and I'm like... this is not cloth.
---
Lol, secretly they all know each other xD
---
Well hopefully - unlike many other people - you are aware that your mic has a mute function!
---
Log in and find out
---
The one and only time a player griefed my camp was outside Whitesprings. I was like level 26 and my buddy wanted to help me level, so he put rocket turrets on my camp and I was using them to tag ghouls and pull them to it.  
---
Level 260 shows up and says I'm ruining the game for everyone else, proceeds to destroy my base and camp me until I take it down.  
---
He was the only other player in Whitesprings.
---
I'll be different.  I thought the event was too easy and repetitive.  And how many do you see actually wearing the masks after the fact.
---
You do have your point, but it's coming from a meta pov.  A lot of regular players, or new players aren't going to e sever hopping to farm resources/caps, and workshops provide both of those while also giving them fast travel locations...is what I want to say.
---
Unfortunately, those players don't want to take them and won't bother as long as Defense events show up on the map, and/or forced pvp from owning a workshop remains a thing(you know, where people just find a workshop owner on the map and hunt/kill them relentlessly because the game allows it).
---
So yeah, they are pretty much pointless to capture, even for FC's unless you have a high enough level and meta enough build to scare/fight off potential griefers.
---
The only downside is the ammo. They are a blast though üòâ
---
Yeah its not worth it.  It seems like half my server is always either too stupid to figure out the pylons or too cowardly to do it because "MuH StIMPackS!" but they sure hang around for the rewards.
---
Yeah. It was offered during school vacation week in my area, so I know a few people who missed the chance to spend Atoms on it because they were away from their computer at the time.
---
I understand that's what it says.  What happens in practice can vary significantly from what they wrote though.
---
We currently have nothing like that available (to build), so it's a significant step.  If it ONLY lets us share drinks (like the brewer only allows them), then it's a small step.  But it's another small step to shared storage for leaving out as gifts to visitors.
---
Go in with a friend your first time in.
---
[](/kcelestiapleased)Looks like all the limited time items(not counting limited time discounts) are a week.
---
IMO, I think the whole "limited time" offers should be done away with. I understand it can be a quick money grab for Bethesda, as it will force some players to buy enough Atoms to get the offer before it expires. I would rather have an Atomic Shop full of items that I can either earn in-game Atoms for (*equals more time playing the game*) or budget my money for a future purchase (*more players, old and new, being able to buy as they can afford*). 
---
Also, I also think items shouldn't be "returned to the vault". Maybe I don't want **that** item for this character or play-through, but I may on my next, so Bethesda just missed out on earning a little bit more of my money.
---
Depends on kill speed. Generally furious, if you aren‚Äôt running a low health build, but if you‚Äôve managed to stack damage up to the point where you kill things in only a handful of shots, Furious doesn‚Äôt reach it‚Äôs potential.
---
Yeah they do - watch out for the drunk cannibal at WS ;)
---
If they kept them in the store people would wait till they get enough free atoms from challenges before buying them where as this way if you don't have enough you are tempted to buy atoms which is fine if it didn't cost as much as they do
---
Me and my friends do this all the time it great
---
wont let me buy atoms :(
---
If the under leveled player comes back later or better yet groups up with the higher level player that's good xp to be had. 
---
Already complaining the game is to easy once your builds are done right. This would be a shit show.
---
Where‚Äôs the source for the fridge item in the shop?
---
Lol yeah that's great ü§£
---
I hear ya - I thought it was just a type-o until my friend tested it and it actually worked.
---
I think it's due to a lot of people having 500 atoms from just doing stuff in game, where 2800 is more of a have to buy caps level. I actually added $5 of irl currency to be able to buy the Raider Excavator, but took a pass on the Plague skin as I didn't want to purchase more caps, even though I really liked it. It is just a game after all.
---
What's the matter with the nuka shine quest?
---
I am indeed
---
He doesn't mention his level. I didn't start it until level 30 and had no trouble taking out the deathclaw on the island.
---
Yeah I get it, they‚Äôre just trying to make a quick buck, which sadly, that‚Äôs the way the gaming industry is these days.
---
Yeah it is a lot but it's a way to support the game.
---
I love the idea. It‚Äôll be great to run around with my friends in the unique skins.
---
Has anyone posted photos of the upcoming skins?
---
Could be like me, 20+ completions, 1 mascot head, 1 mascot body, 2 fixer plans, the rest....... fedoras!!!
---
Ah I wish we had mods! We could have our own radio station that would announce stuff like that
---
Hey I'm down. Im level 51. I usually play at night after my kid goes to bed but I'll add you. I usually solo it in the wasteland 2.
---
jumping works with sentinel, not cavalier. and there's nothing you can do to stop staggering. it's actually better to have dense on your torso.
---
just buy a bunch of stealthboys.
---
What perks would you recommend so because I don't have much knowledge about the perks for smgs
---
Fancy Bar Set can be bought for 700 atoms but the bundle doesn't say it's included, although there is a picture of it.
---
Isn‚Äôt that what the player vending machines are going to be, or could be? If you want to gift something put it in your vending machine at 0 or 1 caps. We obviously don‚Äôt know much about them yet but it should be feasible.
---
You haven't heard those heavy breathers yet have you..ha.
---
Not what hes saying. Hes saying it never happened to him so he didnt realize it was an issue, so he asked if  it was.
---
I'm not aware of any method aside from [The Pneumatic](https://fallout4.wiki.fextralife.com/Pneumatic+Combat+Armor+Chest) armor chest mod. I wager being in Power Armor helps, but I don't know aside from the Pneumatic mod.
---
I don't know if third person or first person helps with the situation. I mean, melee swings are slightly faster in one mode?
---
famine and death? yes, someone even got them in-game.
---
but I don't think anything's been added since last patch.
---
&gt;If this is truly happening so often, then it can't all be user error.
---
You seriously overestimate the user base ;-)
---
if you use the LMG you must be a heavy gunner.
---
I‚Äôve been dropping ALL my legendary stuff on the ground lol.
---
Yeah I was super excited for it but didn't realize that it was limited time. So when I logged in yesterday to get it I was confused/sad. Oh well.
---
I thought cavalier was less damage while moving and sentinel was less damage while standing still.
---
Like, it seems far too easy to knock my character off balance that I feel like I'm missing something. (I even tried making them super fat - lol) 
---
I know pneumatic is reduces incoming staggers, but you're saying I should go for a dense mod instead?
---
I wish there was a mobile Atomic Shop app for us poor saps stuck a work.
---
*"The waiting is the hardest part..."*
---
^(-Tom Petty)
---
From 1 to 99, it was a good weekend.
---
Yes. Dude walked into my camp last week and destroyed all the water purifiers before I had a chance to respond, quickly put me down with what I presume was a bloodied build based on his \~10% HP, then turned my house into a smoking ruin by dropping a nuke grenade before running off. He earned a decent bounty, but I don't think people who do that shit care one bit.
---
Im actually more of a Push to Talk kinda guy
---
Thank you! With how easy they are to walk past do you think people just haven't found them yet or they actually aren't available yet?
---
Considering that we are the ones who generate the revenue for the things they make, yea we are important. I don't give two shits about karma I'm just sick of Bethesda not being transparent enough about things that they are doing. The problems we have had and the bugs we've had are things a small new to gaming studio would be doing.
---
Don't worry the game has plenty of people still playing it; however, the vast majority of them don't comment here, which can make the game appear dead.
---
A friend of a friend thought I stole the junk in their bag, so they destroyed my base. So you're not even safe from people who are supposed to be friendly.
---
Yes. Because they have specific bloodied or assassin builds which I know how to do but i dont like it because i dont play the game for pvp.
---
I can confirm we use the same disc for 3 psn accounts on 2 ps4s.
---
I just wish dailies were completable in a reasonable amount of time or at all. T\_T Stayed up too late last night waiting for stupid airport event to spawn for nothing.
---
Makes sense. If I‚Äôm waiting for my turn at a vendor in a train station, I‚Äôll sometimes sit down in one of the benches facing the vendor.
---
Except Nightwave is the worst thing Warframe has ever created and I can't put how much I hate it into words.
---
&gt;since everyone farming exp ran it.
---
Which was really only a problem to Bethesda. I don't get why they took xp farming away.
---
To be fair they need a way to pay the people that keep the servers running.
---
It only does that if it's a specific thing, like a super mutant or a feral ghoul, etc. Just the top of the Center doesn't show as anything.
---
Doesn't look like you "don't give 2 shits about karma" atl all when EVERY single post is started with "hey guys is that guy who brought you____" like it's of any relevance, or that you're an important figure/vanguard.
---
You can lie and say you don't care as much as you want, it doesn't change the fact you're doing it to seek approval.
---
Whoa, really?
---
I wasn't aware there was any difference between first and third other than visual preference.
---
PA removes all armor (besides underarmor) and I can stand still and take shots from TSE handmade without any damage out of PA vs being literally demolished while in PA.
---
I came across a guy once in-game with his character in the outhouse at his CAMP. I could hear him on his mic, and I‚Äôm pretty sure he was in the bathroom IRL.
---
Now that‚Äôs dedication to your RP.

---
What changes would make you and your friends want to play, since you're obviously on the fence about it?
---
If you are on PC you can use iconsortingTags  [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/146](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/146) 
---
this is a mod that adds an icon in front of many items:  it's great for sorting and managing inventory, but it also adds icons for recipes and weapon/armor mods that are a great visual help to understand what does what.
---
I would really appreciate this.  Until recently I had not tried to funnel all plans to a single character but at this point I've got 5 different builds that I like playing and more often than not I find myself needing to swap characters to craft something I've learned on a different character.  A shared knowledge pool does break some immersion. 
---
However as a quality of life, at the account level I've clearly learned something and so the game has become remembering which character I learned a plan with and then having them log in and craft something, hand off to mule acct, and then log in target character to retrieve from mule.
---
This doesn't help with the camp which is a little frustrating, but what it means is that my first character with all of the camp plans is the one with a nice camp... all my other characters get ghetto camps.
---
&gt;Strange how they "nerfed" all durability, and repair cost perks before selling repair kits, a
---
You mean the OP as hell perks?
---
&gt; how food seems to degrade super fast now,
---
You mean the bug they fixed?
---
&gt;we know for a fact they are adding a refrigerator to the cash shop isn't it?
---
As well as a free backpack with a refrigerator in game?
---
&gt;lmost like they are low key scumbagging the game so we are forced to spend even more of our money on a game 
---
It's most like you're spouting B.S without research
---
cavalier reduces damage while sprinting, not just moving. and you're right about sentinel, but it also works if you're jumping (just jumping, not jumping *around*).
---
melee and shotguns (enforcer) will stagger you most of the time. there's no way around it, pneumatic or otherwise. so you might as well equip dense which paired with fireproof will essentially nullify explosive damage.
---
I still lurk the Albion Online sub, even though I haven't logged in for around six months. Same for ESO. I like to keep up with any developments that might change my mind.
---
conduit- I'm bloody. I can do it for about 1.2 seconds if I get a superstim off fast enough. I am better suited to damaging the beast.
---

Fasnacht in english and in the game, in german its called Fastnacht (i am german mr. know-it-all so you can try correcting me when hell freezes over)
---
Both were added today
---
Get better charisma. It's 1750 caps at the low end
---
I honestly think the servers are run by hamsters on wheels, and server crashes are actually poor hamsters dying. Poor little fluffymuffin died for you, you monster!
---
My camp is on white springs and have yet to find anyone who destroyed my camp. I haven‚Äôt had problems with nukes either. Maybe I‚Äôm just lucky
---
I found the black rider and pale rider online. They look pretty cool.
---
He doesn't have one and is just seeing what he wants to see. Same with the durability nerfs and almost everything he just said.
---
Probably a more involving story line with NPC quest givers and such. As it is now, bugs and issues aside it was an underwhelming experience. Felt like the mission didn‚Äôt have much weigh and we anticlimactic, cause you‚Äôre not emotionally involved when you‚Äôre helping people who are already dead anyway. We collectively lost interest mid way thru. Felt a bit bland. Hopefully something comes along that reignited the excitement we had initially.
---
I've made like 4 or 5 posts total like wtf. Every post I've made is informational considering that I'm a dataminer and what's the point of doing so unless I share what I learn. There's a major difference between seeking karma and attempting to get information out on things. Who are you to say anything as to what my motives for things are? I'm attempting to help people by correcting the incorrect information that keeps being spread.
---
I've seen a bunch of some of the best legendary armors you can get on those market subs, it's just rare.
---
Wow... did they seriously not put it on Steam? What the hell for? There are plenty of games on there that have their own launcher triggered from the Steam launcher.
---
I just got a furious explosive assault gun from imposter and a teammate got a furious explosive handmade from the queen. RNG is just that, sometimes it 1* nocturnal wood leg, other times it's a decent item. They can all be TSE miniguns and gats
---
I know but I'm hoping that proves to be true when someone tries it out.
---
100 caps tops considering the lackluster rewards you get ( 1 legendary mob, the sheepsquatch imposter) which can drop 1-3 star legendaries and a random event reward.
---
The reward of the event is already in no relation to the difficulty, having the entrance fee being above 500 caps is just making it not worth anyones time.
---
It‚Äôs great in Survival mode. Free loots :).
---
I wasn't able to use paypal, which sucked a bunch. Had to enter in card details. Might be your issue.
---
I would also like to choose whether or not to use a mod. For example I had 4 T60 shock mods but eventually bought the plans for it. If I go to put a shock on, I don‚Äôt think it give you the option to install mod or to just use mats. I think it just automatically will use the mods. Key words being ‚ÄúI think‚Äù lol if that‚Äôs the case I we should be given the option seeing as how I can sell the mods easier than a leg with it installed. Hopefully that makes sense. Also wish we could remove mods from one piece and put on another. If I install shocks on level 25 Excavator, it would be nice to take the shocks off the level 25 legs and install them onto my level 45 when I get there.
---
Go buy a lotto ticket right now üëá
---
I'm saying this mostly because of a few people like the guy who posts bug roundups. Renaming everything so that it's at the bottom of the list makes it pretty difficult to accidentally toss it. I find it hard to imagine somebody like that would lie about a bug that doesn't exist
---
wow
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool
---
For some it just auto completes and then doesn't give them the plans for the new work benches.
---
That gift emote is going to be really nice to have!
---
death
---
Or even the off-key singing dudes.
---
So, just jumping straight up and down? Huh. Maybe I've been jumping around instead of just up and down. 
---
Thanks for the tips, with double XP I ended up leveling 5 times without even noticing it so I have some points to work with. I had a pretty unclear idea of what I was wanting to do with this character so my perks are pretty off balance and focused more on the "carry everything you possibly can" aspect than the "hey, don't die" part.
---
Now as I'm realizing that No, I don't need 45 pieces of 1* legendary armor, I'm starting to move stats away from strength and into an actual build.
---
Paradox? You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.
---
Honestly, nothing paradoxical about this, it's just a mismatch, and I often experience the opposite extreme with my &gt;lvl200 character: level 9 ghouls at Whitesprings. Not funny either, but it's nothing a little server hop wouldn't fix. ;-)
---
I have a bloodied build and I'm doing 848 a hit with my bloodied, explosive railway rifle. The character was created for and leveled in survival specifically to PVP and has maxed out perks and mutations for damage. I cannot kill someone in adventure who has pacifist turned on unless it's by contesting a workshop or assisted suicide.
---
There is none, there's a fridge mod for the backpacks though. This person is just angry and spewing incorrect information. If they did add in a fridge it would most likely be free, like the other added utility/crafting stations. The punch bowl is neat and could've been sold for atoms, but has actual utility so it was not. Repair kits hurt my argument but fuck those things, they're hopefully a one off higher up decision.
---
Yeah, still wating like crazy for the handmade skin :/
---
But, a lot of good stuff in this Atom update, my camp will have bart later on today, lol
---
bless you
---
I'd be impressed if the drops worked properly next year.
---
Precisely!
---
Nukashine paint is for 4 PAs or just X01?
---
You can also get plans for any t series, excavator, and raider power armor mods
---
I'm not sure why it bothers me but these are called challenges, not atom quests
---
Great pic!  Well done!
---
just keep in mind you can be staggered while jumping as well.
---
I enjoyed facing enemies that I couldn't beat at level 10, that I could at level 40. Leveled weapons made those tiers more meaningful. Leveled weapons gave more importance to weapon crafting. Crafting is terrible in the late-game due to legendary items. 
---
Taking some of the scaling off level and putting more of that on perk cards would be tougher for mixed builds (e.g. melee/ranged), which are already much weaker than full-specialization.   
---
I appreciate new ideas, but I think your cure is worse than the disease.
---
Normally I hate floating bases but this one has just enough support to trick my brain. I totally dig it, looks great.
---
In FO4, you had to be in caution for them to appear on your compass; however, with a high stealth you could stay in caution and funnel them through certain paths by firing where you want them to go(was a waste of ammo though).
---
Skyrim is far better at allowing for this, since there's a shout that lets you lure enemies to where you target the shout, and then you can pick them off from stealth or slip past them all together.
---
F76 really falls short in this department.  Though it can still be done, you just can't be stealthy about it, which does sort of defeat the purpose of the strategy.
---
Well, unless it was the person playing country roads last night in flatwoods. That was an amazing dance party.
---
Oh this is so exciting! I can't wait to come home and check it out!
---
You sure? "Dear bethesda____" making demands against stealth nerfs?
---
So, is your problem against the nerfs and you demand to know why it was done?
---
That's not "sharing information" that's using information to make a demand in your favour.
---
And why are you doing it? You're not a dataminer, i've looked at your post history and you're a player making ALOT of demands and complaints because other people accused you of being wrong.
---
I see, so this is personal to make a point for your own ego, is it?
---
It's for all 4 and has unique textures for each.
---
Im in the same exact boat and like this one.
---
Maybe I missed something, but what makes laser and plasma weapons so good in PvP?
---
Lol, I've got two in my wallet!
---
Diggin‚Äô the firearms strapped on in strategic locations üëçüèº
---
Because very few want the health loss.  I avoid activating them unless I‚Äôve got good healing stuff in my inventory and I‚Äôm using my high level character.
---
Raider PA skin?
---
You mean like the daily/weekly free atoms that already exist?
---
Ps, I'm deworley

---
Does Wasteland Whisperer do what it did in FO4, where you could understand the (limited) vocabulary of the insects and whatnot? 
---
Won't easily forget the first time I heard bloatflies talking smack.
---
I agree. I'm at the point in my experience, where I'm comfortable spending money, but the value isn't quite there yet. 
---
If this is the price point that they want to be at, they really need to add to the skins to make it worth it. 
---
Each skin should COME WITH a few color variations. That isn't super hard to do, and it would make it so you're essentially buying a few skins at once, adding a lot of value and customization. This would also make skins more appealing, cause sometimes the default skin color might not fit every players' style, but a simple color change can do a lot.
---
I doubt they will just make them cheaper, but I think we should be able to push for more value out of each purchase.
---
But keep in mind items that are "returned to the vault" will be brought back later.
---
Fck ya, looks like some transformer kinda sh*t lol this skin is sooo epic lol i might just buy some atoms
---
This is a damn good idea
---
Same difference
---
I hope you used their report feature for that. They mention real life threats as a reason to do so. Could at least get them banned for being a sack of shit
---
Oh the ones that are impossible to complete either because of bugs or just because of difficulty?
---
ffs I bought the old possum sign last night
---
I used it this way in the glassed cavern when my weapons broke.
---
Oh I know. I have 5 4 are different types of mules
---
I love that you call it The Last Action Hero. I havnt even thought about that movie in 20 years and I still can't help but call it that
---
The X01 Nukashine skin is out?
---
So you're about 6 hours ahead of me ( us east coast) I'm guessing
---
It has happened to me I dont know why but it has. I have had it happened like 3 times for encrypted and then I loose all my steel and lead
---
If I can run it with a Bloodied build, it has to be easier for a non bloodied I would expect. And yes it has put quite a strain on my once abundant supply of stims. That's why when I saw it trigger last night I didn't even bother.
---
yes, 1400 atoms

I don't know [if this applies in FO76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Super_sledge_(Fallout_4)) (check notes, last bullet point).

Every Tuesday I keep hoping that all of my unfinished/bugged challenges magically start working...
---
Looks great...just want a Raider specific paint scheme...
---
I've wanted this for awhile! Thanks Bethesda!
---
It‚Äôs much cheaper than $60. It‚Äôs like $12 for a key on most sites.
---
Well hello Landsmann! ;)
---
It doesn't even matter if they have 125k caps on all characters... None of the players with High end gear have any need for more caps. They will only trade gear for gear. and that sucks. They need a bigger caps sink somewhere and they need to up the cap limit.
---
You saved me from having to comment this.
---
Basically a free nuke zone. I like that
---
Does it go on any of the power armors or is it specific?
---
Eh, prefer the Black Rider skin. 
---
[https://i.imgur.com/XxM4Ml0.png](https://i.imgur.com/XxM4Ml0.png)
---
You seriously know nothing. I'm a dataminer and a mod creator try looking at my post and comment history again. I've made 2 posts directed at Bethesda everything else is either informational or mods I've made one of which fixed a bug that they introduced and the other hides the news popup. Notice how I don't really post often? It's because I don't care about karma. There's nothing wrong with using a clickbaity title to get people to look at something that gives evidence and information.
---
Range, the splitter mod with explosive, fire rate.
---
The explosive mod also deletes the annoying trail they have that is supposed to make stealth with energy weapons hard.
---
If I spawn a bunch of high levels and there is low level players around I just let the low levels tag them and then kill them for the player. Win-win.
---
I also had ot happend while I was heading my sister who was like a level 20 while she was trying to complete her agility test at mclintock.
---
pull out the camera and look around through it. it will say "assaultron" when the sheep is in the picture. use that to triangulate the position.

I've said from Day 1, Bethesda needs to get with Jagex...

Very Nice!

---
Not too bad then - 1400 for 4 unique textures.  I might end up skipping though and saving what little I have for the Ultracite prototype, since I already have a bunch of other skins for the main 4 PAs and the Bone Raider Excavator.
---
I've got my camp set up at an acid node, so I'm sitting on anywhere between 300 and 500 acid at any given time. Mining the Hornwright testing site circuit plus Lucky Hole Mine yields enough lead and steel to keep my 5mm reserves stocked permanently. If I ever get low on acid (low meaning less than 200), I do a quick circuit of Hemlock Holes (Grafton Monster + Snallygasters), Toxic Lakebed (Snallygasters), Charleston (Grafton Monsters + Snallygasters), and then finally Toxic Larry's (Snallygasters) for a fuckton of acid. I haven't tried clearing WestTek and scrapping the mutant guns for steel, but sounds like that could be worth adding to the rotation.
---
But essentially, you're right. There is absolutely zero point in taking any workshop. Even the fusion core processors are debatable because I can't seem to go through cores faster than I'm finding fresh ones. 
---
I think one possible solution could be to make a distinction between *camp* extractors (the kind you can build at your camp) and *workshop* extractors (the kind you build at workshops). Keep camp extractors the same they are currently, and make workshop extractors spit out bulk resources instead of regular scrap. For example, a camp acid extractor would spit out 20 acid/hour, and a workshop extractor would spit out 20 bulk acid/hour (equivalent to 300 acid/hour). If that were the output, I would never not take a workshop.
---
What is the code for 30th April
---
Thank you so much! Do you know if it's limited or not?
---
//sorry for asking I am at work right now
---
You have never heard of people having items going missing from stash? Look it up even on google and in the forums. People have stuff dissappearing all the time. Even the thread i made the other day had dozens of people posting about all the stuff that have dissappeared in their stash.
---
I rarely get staggered. Here's how. Full adamantum skeleton, dodgy, pneumatic mod, fire proof, and serendipity for bloodied. When in Sentinel you CAN'T move around, you can spin, reload, shoot, and press the jump button. Hope this helps üëç
---
pretty sure it is

Some people apparently put up rocket turrets so they can drop by every now and then to loot ghouls, or just mess with people. The higher levels I mean, that don‚Äôt need to do it. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre few and far between though, and that lower levels like you using them to level are much more common. Some people are small minded and assume you‚Äôre a bad guy... just have to deal with it I suppose. Next time just switch servers and keep going, or get your buddy to kill the griefer.
---
Yep, it's there. Here is the video i learned from. It's from fallout 4 but same thing.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-2hPDPRIj4&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
Yes I am so excited for this! I had to message a newbie the other day because I had put everything in a bag for him and he just wouldn't take it and I finally sent him a message like "This is for you!" And they were just like "Why? Why are you giving me this?" D: And I just wanna be helpful but people seem so confused by it?
---
Are you on PS4? I missed the event and I'll buy everything for 6k caps each if you come today!
---
Sometimes I think this game is infected with something. It just does too many strange things.
---
Facts, and when it gets brought up in a report they do nothing about it.
---
copy-paste from a post I made a while ago:
---
&gt;right, so here's my theory. been going over reports dating back to release and most of them have one thing in common: the person pressed the drop key at some point (it's used for several different actions) or sold something to a vendor. not only that, every other aspect varies greatly.
---
&gt;which got me thinking it's sever (de)sync. say you open up a trade window and then close it with tab. on PC, that's the same key used to bring up the pipboy. except the server desyncs and doesn't see you opening up the trade window in the first place, all it sees is that you pressed tab. so the server thinks you have the pipboy open. but then you press R to reload, which is also the drop key, and whatever's highlighted is gone (items are always highlighted, even when the pipboy is not in use)
---
&gt;fast travel is an important checkpoint because, like in Fo4, the game saves and refreshes/resyncs your character on fast travel.
---
I know you care enough for attention. "Hey guys its that guy who brought you that totally unrelated mod to this post because i matter! Respect me!" 
---
P.S nice way to hop on karma train during the repair kit period.... with a repair kit post... asking people to stop....
---
The irony.
---
Level 21 here.. Was playing a small game of Junk conversion at my base, hoping to clear up all of my useless items and supplies in order to put them to some use in the future and repair items that I enjoyed using.. Had a level 11 start shooting at a buddy of mine, than at me. Only kill on the server to say the least. a level 244 and his level 108 friend come and attack me while I'm at a workbench, speaking in a patronizing voice like I'm an adolescent with a learning disability yoink all the junk ((200+ in weight)) and destroy what I have built. Leaving me overencumbered in west fuck all of nowhere. No ability to store my junk, with broken gear that leaves me useless.
---
Honestly, I forget that feature even exists most of the time, and it didn't occur to me. I wish I'd at least written down the guy's gamer tag, because yeah, it was pretty disturbing.
---
Its a skin. Not a paintjob. It goes on all types of PA bug it changes the look the the PA its meant for. Just like Plague makes every PA look like X1
---
The event starts and rather than beginning to escort the Brahmin I stand around sending messages. So long as you dont wave the crook at them they dont move and no enemies spawn. The timer still winds down though.
---
I feel like people dont know what push to talk function is
---
Well one thing is for sure, its definitely better than the plague rider skin.
---
It‚Äôs a bug. 
---
Everytime you log in while wearing Excavator PA you will get 100+ added weight. Once you exit it and or die, it goes back down a 100. 
---
I run 450 Weight when I log in but if I jump out I‚Äôm running 350.
---
That's awesome but I'm on PS4. No mods :(
---
Glad Im not into this game you all sound like bigass babies. I'll go back to factorio where there is a real community. Taking post down that literally talk about the game and are relevent to the game is hypocrisy. People asking if the game is better, or still trash is still relevent to the game. Fuckin' cucks.
---
You mean accidental darth vader impersonators?
---
I think October they plan to have updates to the main story, etc.. they've described it as "game changing" and use other big words.. they also originally planned on having private servers by the end of the year, hopefully some of that stuff does it for you guys..
---
My friends and I just enjoyed it as "fallout with friends", but one of my friends was wrongfully banned, and still is, even though they've never had 100k of anything.. kind of killed my desire to play when one of my friends is perma-banned and they refuse to even reply to his open tickets.
---
If I really cared about karma I would have made a post about the repair kits and how they are a problem not telling people to stop so I can look at the damn front page of the sub without everything being about the repair kits
---
there goes my weekly allowance.
---
Man I wish I had that idea when I had to do that quest.
---
I already asked this question.  There's no definitive answer apparently.
---
So how does that explain months of stuff saved in my stash box dissappearing? I cant drop items from my atash and the items that went missing i wouodnt have dropped at all. I am not understanding how it could happen that way especially for people on ps4 or xbox.
---
But then you will save Atoms up and not spend money.
---
Bone Raider?
---
Well I will have to see what I can do cause I know I have 1200! So close! Thank you for your help!
---
I believe this is a ‚Äúknown‚Äù issue.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/336402/paypal-atom-purchase-issue-april-16-2019
---
This is probably what it is, for the client it looks and sounds like you're hitting but server side you are just a bit off so it overrides and says "nope, no damage.".
---
I definitely love and need this one. This one and the Death skin are must-haves for me.
---
I‚Äôll add you. Lvl 48 going on 49, my PSN is EtherealOcean378, I usually go it alone in the wasteland but I‚Äôve most enjoyed teaming up with others; I‚Äôm down for whatever you feel like doing at the time! I‚Äôm online at random times during the day or late at night (BST), so hopefully we‚Äôll be able to find a time we can team up.
---
Last night I lost every plan and mod I had saved. Even my X01 jetpack I had been saving. Over 100lbs of plans and mods just gone.
---
Did it give you credit for taking a photo with your camera?
---
I bought my copy used for 18 on ebay. If you pay the full 60 you lack imagination in the first place
---
Yes, I noticed that, just looking for a definitive answer from someone that's purchased it.
---
Never said limited time shouldn't be a thing I just said not every cool skin needs to be limited time, having a couple unique skins that everyone can get is a thing that should be in the game and is in many other games
---
Yes, while that may be true, I still see it as potential lost revenue for Bethesda. As someone who has a side retail business, I wouldn't want to take merchandise from my shelves if there is a possibility of making a sale. While forecasting future sale potential is good on paper for the stakeholders, it doesn't pay this month's bills. :)
---
My favorite thing about it is that it actually has a unique animation. Looks pretty good!
---
Thankfully, in England it's ¬£12 on Amazon. Wasn't going to say no at that price, even if I was on the fence.
---
I mean...if I stumble across your camp and I see a couch, I'll usually say "fuck yo couch" and destroy your couch..subsequently I'll drop some wood and cloth for repairs. I'm a nice asshole.
---
Good to know. Thanks for the info!
---
I really like breaking into people's houses. When I find someone's camp I'll spend a decent amount of time trying to figure out ways of getting into their house without opening locked doors. If I get in,l I'll leave a few items in a bag for the person to find when they come back to CAMP.  The amount of people that have interactable things right next to their windows is ridiculous.
---
Their logic was probably "why give Valve a 30% cut of every sale when we already have our own launcher?"
---
That, or they didn't want the transparency that comes with Steam showing sales numbers and concurrent players.
---
Stupid question but sentinel doesn't work while crouched, right?
---
Yep, that's what I'm seeing too. So there isn't a fix at this time I assume?
---
I haven't had any problems with the cost or frequency of the event, maybe I am just lucky? I'm level 150 and I can buy the stuff for the keycards without any trouble. Also the event seems to come up at least once when I play, and I haven't had more than 1 or 2 experiences where the other players did a poor job of taking pylons and dealing damage to the SS Assaultron. Last night a bunch of other players even posed with me for pictures after the fight. Despite the underwhelming rewards I have really enjoyed the challenge of Encryptid. One time I did the event with a team of 4 players and nobody else, we did really well too.
---
And no I didn't accidentally drop all of that stuff. It was in my stash box.
---
Dupers killed fluffymuffin.
---
I had my entire stash dissappear yesterday morning. Same thing, tons of plans amd legendary items as well as my junk items amd ammo, all gone and when i reported it they did nothing more than tell me that i shoukd try to re install the game or turn my system off and on again. They even went as far as telling me they dont have the tech to be able to go on my character or account to fix the issue
---
I forgot to mute mine. Standing at the Whitesprings train station using the craft bench when the dog hears a noise outside and lets loose a full volume **BARK**. I hear someone inside at the vendor yell "Jesus!"
---
Yeah...it has been around there since like week 4...  Sorta annoyed the crap out of me cause my copy was a preorder for the power armor edition.  And you know where that got me.  Black friday really dropped it low for a bit.
---
Not here to complain, just hasn't been $60 for a loooong time.
---
Don't carry so much crap is the only solution.
---
Ahh I see. That‚Äôs actually a lot but doable in 900 hours. Especially since he said he‚Äôd been hurt or something and so he was off work. I know I like to grind the shit out of crafting things in games so I have a tonne of everything I could possibly need, then I don‚Äôt need to worry about it later on.
---
Not saying he didn‚Äôt dupe, but the fact that he had all of that ammo isn‚Äôt really enough to condemn him considering he had 900 hours. That‚Äôs a lot of time played to assume he spent a small portion of that duping and the rest what... walking around killing random ai? That‚Äôs a lot less believable than him crafting all that stuff legitimately because he was off work with an injury.
---
It does include the bar set.
---
This should be upvoted, five million times. Almost all guides I've come across deal with getting lines through doorways, how to hook up the connections through the wall... which is still bugged. This video was a time/life saver. Wish I had found it sooner, before I destroyed my camp twice trying to get power through the whole thing. Thank you soo much.
---
Que up boys!
---
Fluffymuffin is a molerat.
---
That's why they introduce new things and limited things- to push the sales on those items plus it will most likely increase the sales on the "limited" items when they come back in stock - because everyone who has seen an item that was limited and been like "Oh man I wish that I had bought that or hadn't missed it." they're all going to do their best to buy that item as soon as it comes back in.
---
There has been a bug for a long while where if you are in Excavator when you first log on, you have +100 carry weight (on top of the +100 you should get). So the bug you are experiencing is not that you are losing 100 carry weight, it's that you have 100 more than you should have when you log on, and as soon as you get out of PA or die it resets down to what it should be! 
---
Which means where they do fix the bug, you will be 100 down permanently, I'm afraid.
---
It's got that Slyrim flare
---
Yeah, but with the 4 horsemen skin that they‚Äôre pushing now
---
I was just thinking today how fun color variants would be. I'd want them to be craftable in game, like, we would have to go around and find paint and/or plants to use for the colors.
---
stop being defensive and accusatory
---
we get alot of people coming on here and ripping the game
---
this guy chimed in to say he doesnt like the game as it is or play it
---
you are jsut being purposefully obtuse to not see why this is ridiculous
---
I like this idea the best so far
---
Because lead is very heavy.
---
It does not work while crouching.
---
Isn't every single  Kevduit Video titled "You won't believe how aweful Bethsda is! Here's what they did this time!" 
---
Then a patch comes and before anyone discovers any haneous bugs (like the mods, friend list, etc. we got last time) his video is called "Fallout 76 saved by best patch yet!"
---
I run around blasting cum town.
---
How about a tsk tsk finger emote.
---
server sync is an universal issue, not just limited to pc. and from what I gather, the key mapping on consoles is similar to PC.
---
if I'm right, essentially the only thing that needs to happen for an item to "disappear" is for the game to desync, think you have the pipboy open when you don't, and you pressing the drop key/button.
---
the game then drops whatever is highlighted on the pipboy. if I'm right, a lock function/confirmation window before dropping an item would fix the issue.
---
I'm not sure how this would translate to stash items, but it's probably similar. as for an entire stash disappearing, I have no idea.
---
I'm considering buying Atoms for the first time, but I also wish that Bethesda would credit us for all the lost Atoms from the impossible to do camera challenges that came out before the camera did. If they made that gesture, I'd be more open to getting atoms.
---
Adamantium skeleton no limb damage so no stagger
---
It will be interesting to see if player vending has any effect, but I doubt it. If they eliminate the cap ceiling, at least some of the gear falls into a buyable range. The ultra high end stuff, like legacy explosive energy weapons will never be obtainable with caps.
---
Thank you! This is what I was looking for.
---
Does bloodied work best with sentinel? It makes me uncomfortable to see my health bar low, so I've been wary about this type of build, if only because I know I would always be anxious as shit.
---
And don't forget it helps lvl 15 players look cool in their raider PAs as well.
---
The queue up quest is in the next patch (not it's not but hey as a fellow Englishman I can dream)
---
This is THE SINGLE BEST THING EVER ADDED to the Atomic Shop.  
---
Bar none.  
---
Thank you so very, VERY much!  
---
(I've had to drop bags on the floor and pistol shoot 'em to get people to look down so many times... and some never understand. Gah!)
---
Need something strictly for the Raider chasis
---
*heart emotes* been wondering about this forever - thanks for the clarification
---
So many people act like this game is so great and barely has any flaws, i want the copy of the game they downloaded then. Every one i know is going through all of this and not getting any kind of help when they report it. And then people wonder why less people play this game each day. They focus so much on releasing new content you have to pay real money for but so little on fixing the glitches and issues the community is facing in their game.
---
That kind of defeats the purpose of the excavator PA as I use it for farming the junk I need for my CAMP, repairs and ammo. Now, if I could find the calibrated shocks for my X-01, then maybe things would change. ;)
---
I haven't lost anything from my Stash yet - but I have lost my PA chest piece (while I was out in a blast zone- I didn't trade it or drop it and it didn't break as it was recently fully repaired to 200%) and several of my friends have lost their PA legs and one of them lost a legendary handmade :/
---
this comment is unrelated to the thread in question. 
---
if you are looking for nuke silo codes for this week you can check  [https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
I haven't taken it in a while, but I used to farm 200 - 2000 caps a night from people trying to take it from me. 
---
It was the only times I liked RaIdErs.
---
I have a vampires ripper. The vampires effect works even if you‚Äôre not hitting enemies, so I can just use it in the air to heal, and it doesn‚Äôt use durability. It doesn‚Äôt outspeed the damage I take but it seriously slows it down and I can just use the odd diluted stimpack or healing salve.
---
its 17 total per hour. That means in an hours time, 17 of your plants, not of each kind, will have been produced. So you would do well to scale back your farm to something like five of each, so that all five yield crops every hour. This would greatly improve your efficiency and allow you to control which of the crop types are producing when you show back up to harvest.
---
Just 1 point in demo expert nets 20% no need to go full hog to see a pretty sizeable improvement.
---
Seems common people will fully rank cards out of habit, but it's not always the best route.
---
Yup. It's loaded with hackers and gear whores. You will eventually run into them, lose a lot of caps, and realize Survival isn't worth it. There are only 2 ways to deal with it: Never re-engage people who you have fought once and are obviously running full assassin/sent (or similar) and legacy duped explosive weapons, or are one-shotting you from outside visual range (hackers). OR quit playing Survival. Gear (especially legendary armor) matters too much to overcome after they nerfed the ability to VATS one-shot snipe them. You are either one of the few with an overwhelming gear advantage, or you are easy meat. Don't feed the bears.
---
lol
---
So the account key isn't tied to an account? You only need one disc for however many people use it? This doesn't sound right at all
---
You cant drop otems from your stash or view your pip boy in stash. All you see is your stash and your heald items. De syncing the way you are explaining would not explain items goong missing from stash but going missing from your held inventory.
---
I'd never heard of the Division until it had a free weekend on steam but I did try it and I did buy it. I think they would sell a lot of f76 if they did this but they should wait until they put it on steam. Anyone who has the bethesdanetlauncher got it for f76.
---
It used to be that multiple people could be the conduit for one pylon, and the requirement for making the sheepsquatch imposter vulnerable was to have 3 conduits in general, not a conduit at each pylon. So 3 people as conduits for one pylon made in vulnerable. That‚Äôs supposed to be fixed now.
---
I think it's the type of thing I just need to practice with and see what works for me. Just PvP with a friend and get feedback to recognize the weaknesses I have and try to improve.
---
(One of which is my asshole dog who will literally try to steal my controller. But that's what I get for naming him Preston Garvey)
---
Yeah but at the same time the way I see it is, I have over 500 hours in and exactly 0 rounds of ultracite ammo and not even 10% of the ammo he had.  
---
Also bethesda flagged it u as "over a 30 day period" and not the whole time he was playing
---
Haha, I had a fat lady economics teacher back in high school giving me the tsk tsk finger emote and saying, 'Naughty, naughty!'

I feel ya bro...

They need to check out Doom for what a chainsaw can do
---
At least it wasnt your stash stuff, even still im sorry for your loss of items. It sucks. I honestly hope they fix all these issues in the game but if they havent fixed them so far im worried they probably wont fix them at all :/
---
It‚Äôs just a joke I know that. In real life if lifting weights were made of lead people would die from working out.
---
I love it, so dying fixes the initial bug! Well, at least the "soon to be added" backpacks will work with PA sets, so maybe there is a workaround coming. :)
---
Syringer ammo.  Mini nukes.  Missiles.  Railway spikes.
---
I would like to try and provote an answer from bethesda, I dont wanna buy the bundle if it doesnt include the set and I dont want the set if its in the bundle, wanna get the most for my atoms
---
Seems to be an bug with bodies turning invisible which was revealed by using the camera. Things can fall through ground or get completely skyrocketed too. I killed a radscorpion in whitespring and a giant robot aggro'd someone and ended up shooting a bus that exploded and sent the corpse straight to the moon never to be seen again. Would be nice if they added a long glowing pillar on dead legendarily that aren't looted.
---
It doesn't.
---
And now I know another reason I've been taken out so easily. I didn't know this, either..
---
I mean, I know this post is being downvoted to hell, but I'm learning a lot so I don't even mind.
---
Thanks for asking that question and providing even more knowledge!
---
Lmfao
---
That is a brilliant idea
---
It be like that sometimes (always)
---
Uhhh. Still lost me.  Can‚Äôt tel if you‚Äôre being serious now.  Ever play goldeneye on n64?  Thengames on the cartridge.  You put the fo76 disc in the PS4 and play. You take it out.  You can‚Äôt play.
---
It‚Äôs $10 currently
---
Thank you!!! Thank you so much this is what im talking about! Lots of people in the community are losing things and the company doesnt give a damn about us or our problems, if they did this issue would be solved by now.
---
I quit like a few weeks in because hot damn the game was awful. I'm starting to see buzz that the game has improved. What exactly has changed? Is there meaningful PVP now? Is PVE less boring? Are you still a superman that never dies (game was way too easy at launch). Is inventory management improved? 
---
Also, what's the modding situation these days? There were a few sorting mods and tweaks early on. Did Bethesda crack down on that?
---
This actually made me lol, nice work!
---
I third this.
---
I like mini nukes still for crowd control, although they're extremely heavy.
---
I definitely believe that the Death one will be the one to wait for. I'm loving the Nukashine paint too!!
---
But do you farm it like crazy? I spent 60 hours of game time straight (spread out in real life though, I‚Äôm not crazy) just farming ammo and a couple other things. If all you did for hundreds of hours, you‚Äôd have a LOT of ammo, especially if you knew all the best ways to get the mats. Also back when he played, extractors have scrap instead of ore so he didn‚Äôt need acid to smelt iron ore or lead ore.
---
Looks cozy
---
I know. which is why I said I don't know how it'd translate to stash items.
---
when/if the server desyncs, it desyncs. it's hard to keep track of your actions on both the client AND the server. mainly because one is "invisible". I can see it happening if, for example, the server desyncs and you empty your entire stash to move things around.
---
I've only ever heard of stash items disappearing twice, this being the second. meanwhile there are dozens upon dozens of reports of disappearing held items.
---
Maybe on consoles.  On PC, the exclusivity of Borderlands 3 on the Epic Store has bred a lot of resentment.
---
Pretty well everything but 5mm, shotty shells and 308.
---
From my experience people we're a lot nicer on console than PC.
---
You purchased it and can confirm?
---
I got a bunch of them at level 5-10 at faschnaut and quickly got rid of them.  I wouldn't of if there wasn't this whole mythical legendary vendor to stock up all my 1*s for. :(
---
They should at least have more than half a week to buy, give us a full month.
---
I mean..you can sell the pins for a cap still, right?
---
I already got it but it‚Äôs on amazon for like ¬£15
---
I have a big list of people who have added me because of this issue ive brought up and all of them have lost stash items. It sucks. Ive lost individual items and most recently my whole stash was empty and i dont take every thing out to re arrange stuff, lots of the stuff i lost i had for a while in there. Even stuff from game release.
---
As a heavy weapons user I have max Bandolier which makes most ammo weightless, so I always take anything without weight, including .38. I avoid 10mm and 308 like the plague.
---
I think they programmed her to have the same personality as one of the raider that died
---
Stay under the 450 LBS limit which is the correct weight limit for the Excavator with perks if you don't want to deal with it, the 100lbs is a bonus and maybe should only be needed when you really need to carry something, You will never get close with your X01 with the same carry weight. With my Excavator I can get up to 580LBS which includes the 100.
---
This! There are SO  many people that don‚Äôt know about this. This trading sub is far superior to others IMO because of its karma system. There needs to be a link posted so people know that it‚Äôs a trusted sub.
---
Here's the thing, I'm at the point where I basically don't believe anything people say about this game unless I see video evidence or experience something myself.
---
Yes, I believe pretty much any weird bug is *possible* but so many people have spread so many lies about the game that I now need first hand proof. It's basically the boy who cried wolf of video games.
---
It's so dead there now, I get hit with a wave of depression as soon as I walk down the main street..
---
I cant find the poster in camp
---
I run a bloodied sniper build and picked up an unyielding sentinel max lv leg yesterday that I haven't had a chance to try out yet - I asked about the crouching piece because of the sneak attack bonus and not wanting to lose it. In theory if you're far away and snipe from afar, you should be fine. In theory.
---
A friend runs bloodied melee weapons with cavalier but their playstyle is more focused on running - I'd say it's all about what weapons you want to use.
---
Side note - Serendipity is a bloodied build's best bud
---
Hard agree on all counts. I camp on a uranium node for booze making but beyond that its all farmed/scrapped materials for me. Holding workshops just isnt worth it.
---
"cool"ness is subjective.
---
There's a group on PC that does this. They are on quite often and will just jump events killing everyone doing them. They'll murder you over and over even if you don't fight back, claiming how good they are and how bad you are. They do this weird baby voice at people too and it's honestly all kinda sad. They told me their goal is to make people quit playing. If I could compare it to anything it would be like they are the most hardcore team of the special Olympics, a place where people just want to be appreciated and have fun. I don't know their exact tags but the main two I know are Oooooonce and vivianpresidenta or something like that, so avoid them if you're not a fan of pvp or angry weirdos.
---
thank you for clarification
---
It will come out soon we just don‚Äôt know when
---
Really?  Adamantium Skeleton does this?  I would have thought that staggering was a component of limb damage.
---
I fucking know right? What about us folk that which run around in a skin tight vault suit and combat, raider, marine, leather, or metal armor?
---
I still think the Bone Raider Excavator skin is better.  The bones and welded bits are much nicer.  The jaded paint underneath was also nice.  I just wish they would add variants for the other Power Armor models.  Imagine the Bone Raider theme on T-51 or T-45?
---
GWAR comes to mind
---
Same goes for the serums
---
It really depends. So bloodied, in general if you do your perks right means high DPS and with sentinel its great. So you have the opportunity to waste everything on site if you play your cards right. But when someone else lands a crit on you say goodbye. They also might get a minor stagger and if they get another quick shot in its bedtime for you. With all this said bloodied is definitely my favorite. 1410 damage a shot. I cant say no lol. 
---
There is also a high health version I'm working on the would use Sentinel/Vanguard and as many health perks as possible to negate being one shot. And really just and overall pain in the ass unless he is being crit shot constantly. But this way is overall safer, but dont except to one shot everything.
---
This is a serious question, but are you sure the items in question arent being scrapped and you are misremembering where the item last was (re: in stash or on your personal inventory)? I say this, because I have seen split second visuals of legendary items showing up in my scrap list when I am mass scrapping weapons and/or armor. It wouldnt explain plans, but mods can be scrapped as well, so those could be accounted for. 
---
The server desync issue makes sense in some scenarios, but not scenarios where the item in question resides in the stash behind an interface with no options to scrap or drop directly. I feel it could be explained as the server believing you retrieved the item from your stash and placing it in your personal inventory before then resyncing to the fact that the item was not in fact in your inventory - at which time it would cease to exist in either upon the next refresh. 
---
I haven't heard of this happening to anyone I play with personally, but I have seen anecdotal accounts of it for a few months now.
---
There is a mod to do that on the nexus.
---
I'm really nervous about it tbh - because after I lost my PA piece and I had remade it and everything - I started putting my PA in my stash until I need it since I only use it for queen fights. So now that stash might be missing things too? What are we supposed to do?
---
Good old Arnie. I know it was a cheesy movie, but it was cheesy in a good way. But yeah that was immediately what I thought of when I saw the name =)
---
Use V.A.T.S... While not in combat?
---
this is kinda last-resort but is your password safe? easy combinations are easy to crack and there's money to be made in Fo76. it \*could\* be that someone is stealing your stuff.
---
other than that, I'm gonna more details about how it happened. video footage would be great, too.
---
It gives me 30% hit chance lol
---
I was wondering the same thing about my weapon. How rare is it?
---
I've got a BE gatling laser. Actually dropped for me and never been duped. I never see people offering them here on Reddit... then again, I wouldn't give mine up for anything.
---
Thanks, I like it. 
---
Just realized I forgot to place the punchbowl, so I changed the pic out lol
---
If you can hear them, that means their hot mics are set to area.
---
You maybe honest doesn‚Äôt mean everyone within earshot is as well
---
Was your previous hit chance 30%? Then it's adding another 30%? (100%)
---
If I‚Äôm being honest, I just hate server hopping. So if there is ever a material I feel like passively collecting, I‚Äôll just take a WS and collect it.
---
Oh is that how it works?
---
This; I overheard someone AFK in Winterspring, but with their mic still on 'enjoying' adult entertainment.
---
Yeah, it's a regular world drop, not one of the special ones.
---
Any time I join the event I bring molotovs for that reason.
---
I just wish people stopped using grenades because they're fucking annoying. At the SBQ, Whitespring nuke zones, Encryptid, basically any group events with lots of enemies.
---
Just say no to 'nades. Please.
---
That's what it says.
---
It strongly depends on your build. A melee user is less inclined to pickup ammo, for example. I personally don't pickup any heavy weapon ammo, and keep only a handful of fusion cores for when I need to go mining.
---
Railway rifle is actually pretty good, with the right build. I can't say the same about the other two, outside of having a god roll legendary.
---
Sorry I interpreted the thing wrong I thought it was a 100% vats hit chance
---
So I was remembering FO4 mechanics correctly, and that's what I want; I've been carrying around low damage grenades like frag or molotov hoping to draw out the enemies and have them focus on the point of explosion (same deal with shooting cars). Any explosions for which I am responsible do put me in [Caution], but it seems like the AI focuses in on the point from where the grenade was thrown or where the gun was fired (huh?!), so it becomes an annoying game of snipe, then immediately strafe away from where you're hiding. In any event, it seems reasonable to have the red dots appear when in [Caution]...
---
I‚Äôd love to see the wasteland wander paint for the marine armour, failing that standard camo would be awesome. 
---
I know it‚Äôs sad but I‚Äôd love to be able to colour match my armour sets to my PA sets.
---
I hate how it is a gimmick weapon.  I would use it if you could increase its damage further with perk cards and if Legendary variants could be found.  The Chainsaw was devastating in Fallout New Vegas.
---
No worries. Tried there and the taxidermy, I'm guessing they're fakes.
---
It does make sense, but I never really would have made the connection. Think about taking a punch to the torso vs a kick to the leg or shoulder. You're much more balanced if you're being hit in the torso vs limbs. 
---
So removing the damage to the limbs would leave only the torso taking damage.
---
I guess?
---
I got over 7500 atoms and have a few items from the store, spent zero cash. Work those challenges!
---
Yeah, that what I've been doing - I'm trying to stay under the 450 limit now. 
---
Naw, I never expected to get my X-01 set anywhere close to my excavator set, it was more of a joke on the rarity of the X-01 calibrated shock mods. I had them, but lost them to the repair bug before I had a chance to apply them to my set. RIP.
---
Thanks for the reply :)
---
That's a different world spawn mask, not one of the event masks
---
If she's got a robobrain, then maybe...
---
Unless you have more than one suit of Power Armor...?
---
I think that a huge paint and customization patch would be great. I'd definitely want the customization to be centered around crafting and utilizing in game items.
---
I don't know too much about their shader capabilities, but it seems like they have layered materials, so color options should be possible. 
---
When talking about this kind of stuff, people often say that they wouldn't be able to sell skins if we can customize too much, but I think they'd be able to sell more. If I KNOW that I can make a skin fit my look with customization, it's way more valuable to me. 
---
They just wouldn't be able to sell super basic stuff, like the chrome excavator. Instead, they could sell chrome for power armor. Chrome could be one layer of a look. Other layers could include paint and decals. 
---
For all of [Anthem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthem_\(video_game\))'s faults, they had a pretty [good blueprint for armor customization](https://youtu.be/ivGNly4umo8), and I think that a lot of aspects could do nicely with we've got going here, if their technology can hang.
---
You cant scrap legendary items that are sitting in your stash and every time i scrap i locate my scraps to my stash box. I didnt even think you coukd scrap legendary since its not coded that way. And my entire stash was empty,not a note or a piece of scrap steel or any thing. I have no reason to have all that stuff on my character and be over weighted the whole time. Also the legendaries and various plans in question have been in my stash un touched for some time because i dont require them nor would i have given them up any time soon. I wokr up and my stash was empty. Before i went to bed my stash was loaded. I know this because i stored 2 different plans and a bunch of scrap before passing out.
---
Is that Chris and Shrewsbury in the picture?
---
for a second there, I thought it was going to be the teddy bears over in the dinner, north of the shooting range. There's one bear in a pot being cooked by another bear.
---
Yep, exactly my point. Suddenly poof, no longer a 25k cap limit per character
---
The ability to abandon / relinquish a workshop would be a very welcome change. Whenever I have to claim workshops in adventure mode for daily/weekly challenges - I find myself having to claim / abandon server - to avoid unwanted PVP. 
---
I also thought it was odd that they made it so you get more caps for PVP in adventure than Survival - I feel it should be the opposite.
---
I pick up everything, and anything I don't need I put at an Overseer's Stash.
---
I usually just sit on the bench and wait.
---
I feel like this might be kind of a trial run for a system like that.
---
Huh, never used conduits before in fo4 mainly because I always had trouble with them. The more you know
---
Perk respec in the atom shop would be a huge step in the wrong direction but I do think players should be able to experiment in different builds and play styles after a certain level without the time commitment. 
---
You can make the argument that if you did it the first time you can do it again, but the difference to me is that the first time I did it the game was new to me. I was exploring and learning and the leveling was a byproduct that just happened as I went. Respec for me now requires more of a mindless grind because leveling is the only goal. The exploration is over so you feel the time more. And at the end of it all, if you respec and decide it‚Äôs not for you then it‚Äôs another grind to get back to what you were or to role the dice on a new build. This time grinding with a build you don‚Äôt like.
---
It should but I notice on my be handmade the number are unaffected but it works on my explosive shotgun. Just a bug I assume.
---
Hi dad, I'm dad!
---
Fought him last night. Died for no reason randomly out of the blue. Didnt get hit. Stuck in loading limbo had to restart game. Yup.. Lost my junk i had collected for 3 hours. Fuck 76 the games broken in all ways.
---
Just like I saw an entire horde of liberators that were diseased
---
No one would be able to figure out my ps4 password. I also have friends who play at odd times that would have messaged me right when seeing me on and if i didnt respond they would have sent me a FB message letting me know my system was on and i was in the game and un responsive.
---
The bug is actually that you have 100 extra when you log in. If they fixed the bug then you‚Äôd permanently be down. 
---
Say your base carry weight is 250. The excavator should bump it to 350, but sometimes it bumps it to 450 instead.
---
Your bug is that you have an extra 200 instead of an extra 100.
---
What's the stack limit on bobby pins?
---
I love that Bethesda actually listens to the community. First with the goodbye wave and now this emote.
---
It disappeared for me after the sheepsquatch update
---
Its not in my completed quests i have part one of tge recipe and can pick up part 2 but that's it cant craft tge nuka shine or anything else
---
Heavy weapons. I love MG‚Äôs, I just haven‚Äôt got enough .308 cal. :(
---
I like Papa Nurgle..... I mean Plague Rider better, but this is definitely up there.
---
Something like that yeah, add me up and when you're next online just hola
---
How many atoms is that?
---
Yeah i belive so
---
Thank you for posting this as I can't open Beth website at work.
---
Now all you need is 4 mutated turtles to fight against and you are all set.
---
As an owner of a bloodied ripper I'd imagine they would be a good effect for one.
---
I just want to be able to craft the darn thing. It sucks being limited to only a lv 20 spawn. Imagine a lv 50 one, cutting through hordes of supermutants.
---
so can you expand on it? give more details about what happened, exactly?
---
Nice. Great picture by the way
---
Same thing. I think it's gonna be next.
---
That Nukashine skin tho...
---
That more than makes up for it
---
Same lol
---
Just to be clear, the bug is that you're getting 100 lbs of extra carry weight that you shouldn't be getting. 
---
And sometimes when you exit your armor or die, the bug goes away and your carry weight is correct. 
---
If they fix get the bug fixed, that 100 lbs goes awaay forever.
---
Fellow architect here. Glass walls can be both modern and traditional, depending upon whether you're looking at a Victorian conservatory/orangery, or something like Richard Neutra's 1950's design studio. Personally I see the style of the Fallout universe to be derivative of 1930's Art Deco streamlining, but filtered through a 1950's lens (think more of the period automotive design). I think Watoga, the Garrahan estate, and Arktos Pharma are all good examples of this  in FO76.
---
For the record, I really want fully glazed wall sections and glazed roofs, both for greenhouses and so I can get my Stahl House (Case Study House #22) mojo on.
---
Definitely. Think about all the time you shot a scorched, or goul in the leg and and crippled them. They have that step back animation which implies a cripple. I definitely can say the same for humans in the wastland cripple the leg for large stagger, arm for a smaller stagger, and maybe the head. But yeah, think about when you get your leg broken. There is the same animation (if not amplified) that plays as if you had gotten staggered. üëç
---
This is what im saying, we shouldnt have to be stressed worrying about weather our items are going to be on our account or not. What we have should stay unless we remove or destroy or trade them. I was worried before about items on my person but since this has been happening it leaves me not even knowing what to do with my stuff. Friends are also stressing on it and unsure of what to do.
---
Hell yeah! This was a needed emote for sure.
---
I can imagine and it would be glorious, I'd love a level 50 variant
---
Why on earth would you take that much junk to any large fight? Scrap it and stash it.
---
THAT is an important question... I've only ever gotten up to the upper hundreds before I started selling them off. I now know my new purpose. .....
---
Actually, you should check all the lockers, as sometimes the locker won't have much in it, and rarey it won't have any in it.  Usually, if it doesn't have anything in it, you can just press the take/confirm button(X on PS4) even if there's nothing to take and it will confirm.  However, I have had a few times where I've had to put something in the locker then take it back out for it to complete the event; this has only ever happened on servers that are really laggy.
---
Hope this helps.
---
Try relogging, sometimes things seem to get stuck in a server or something.
---
I get them from the Scorchbeast Queen.  I actually don't mind them at their current drop rate, because now it's possible to breakeven on your repairs after fighting her.
---
They do have weight, so you might as well use them.
---
You can get more weight with calibrated shocks, and there's also a torso mod that'll give you another 50 lbs, I believe.
---
All the ammo you listed except .38 i pick up as i have their weapons. I like the railway rifle as it looks cool. I like the crossbow to shoot my friend with. And the black powder pistol can be used to good effect on lower level enemies.
---
I think she was human once? Rosalyn? And on the holos the guy calls the woman rose for short. IDK. That's how I pictured it when I did the quest anyway.
---
Zero
---
Thats the thing. I was on my way to do that and the fucking sheepsquach even popped up. Couldnt pass it up sibce i dont play a lot and have hardly anytime for it. It was random. So yea. Game failed and fucked me AGAIN
---
Hard to really explain how stuff goes missing from stash or on our personal characters inventory. All i do is farm and run content like any one else. When i lost ,y whole stash i had pit away scrap i collected that night and the morning i woke up to a empty stash. Not entirely sure on what more i could add.
---
Haha just saw that. And a free punch bowl
---
Its a skin for all PA suits. I think it looks too much like TES:Oblivion daedric gear.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about buying the game a bunch lately but I‚Äôm deciding between 76 and WW3
---
I'm pretty sure they're just going to release them as time goes on. The sbq mount is the one I want the most.
---
It somehow reminds me of samurai armor)
---
Nah i dont, i know its entirely possible to get the crazy high numbers of ammo and stuff, but meh, im 50/50 on the whole thing, it might be possible yes, but the dedication to collecting ammo would require some patience, even with a set daily run, bare in mind ultracite ammo requires fluxes to make too so it also rewuires hammering out nukes or buying them, and silos have a (i think) 24 hour waiting limit per silo per player as ive been turned away from lainching from the same silo within certain timeframes even on different srvers where that silo is ready to launch.  
---
Either way im not too invested in wether or not he did or didnt cheat, no way im ever gonna know really so meh
---
I try to be a conduit but since I am low level I end up dead in less than thirty seconds. I don‚Äôt have PA or anything. And then most of the time I‚Äôm ignored when I go down.
---
Not too bad. Haven't played with it yet but punch bowl seems fun.
---
How many suits of Armor can you wear at a time?
---
No problem. Being a total barsteward irl I got the set straight away. Just need to find them barrels now.
---
Should be noted that this game has taken more than it has given me.
---
Theres a bar! Finally, no more makeshift bars using shelves and desks. Lol. 
---
Gonna be spending some real $$$ this time around. If they keep adding items like today, they will start to see a lot more of us spending money in the Atom Store. 
---
But can we get some cooler skins for the non power armor armor as well please. I buy the PA skins, but only get to show them off in the nuke zones. Id love a combat armor skin like the war horseman armor for PA.
---
Well that‚Äôs what I think too but why was the wendigo one in such a random location with no leads to going there to even get it
---
Where did  that come from? Nice
---
I think me too, haha.
---
I loved this game sooo much that when it went on sale I bought two of my friends it
---
I have shocks on both legs, but run coils on the torso to tag mobs in nuke zones.
---
inject it into the joints, use it as lube
---
There's almost always time to scrap your junk and put it in a stash before you go over there. It literally takes seconds to scrap and stash. Even if you just FT to the nearest train station, and go from there, it's like 30 seconds all around.
---
Are you on PC?  If so I think we've met lol  I had someone tail me for damn near ten minutes once.
---
It's a little better with 2 accounts - you can farm on one while your other is loading lol. All of the extra load time is server related, not based on your PC. At this point though, the only thing that really requires it is steel farming for me, and that doesn't take long, even if I'm crafting 100K .50 Cal ammo it's only a few hours of farming at most.
---
i take all, and cram it into a train station suitcase
---
Are they not drops from the imposter event?
---
Maybe for you. Not for me. It takes a few mins. You probably play on pc. Im on xbox
---
Atom shop.
---
THAT.
---
Tried yesterday - not sure if it was because it was legendary but I could not even get a prompt
---
Maybe you should try playing it how it is, and not how you think it should be.
---
Plus. I dont have caps to waste on fast travel all over just to stare at loading screens for 5 mins.
---
Just came to find out the same thing. Please answer u/LoneVaultWanderer u/Valseek
---
The other day I went to a player shop to trade and after I got what I wanted, I saw there was a line formed behind me lol I was like aw how cool is that, just little stuff like that make me love the game and the community even more
---
I agree haha
---
No, there are random sidequests, also.
---
If it was free to play this would be a justifiable reasoning. But it‚Äôs not. We supported the game by buying it. 
---
Not saying I don‚Äôt enjoy it but I‚Äôd be more likely to purchase atoms if they went further. 
---
One day the servers will be shut down and all we‚Äôve accomplished and all the money we‚Äôve spent will be gone.
---
the small details are what really matter. for example, the game refreshes your character on login and fast travel. so if you fast traveled, stashed your junk, everything looked ok and you closed the game, only to find stuff missing on your next login, that means something when wrong in between the fast travel and you closing the game.
---
do you quit your session properly before closing the game? or do you use the PS4 menu to forcefully close it/shut the PS4 down while the game is still running?
---
Back then people were still figuring out what the game was though.
---
Blegh. Well, my apologies for the troubles you've gone through. I'd invite you to join in on my social group, but again, solitary by nature.
---
Which is why u think they should up rarity of finding this random encounter
---
Maybe they plan on adding something there that's worth while to find it. I've found random plans strewn around Appalachia. Also wasnt the wendigo mount at the restuarant? Maybe it's a hint that they feed people human meat, turning them into wendigo.
---
I feel like they're going to slowly roll out week by week. What's the Monongah one? Not sure if I have it yet.
---
The three I have done. I was talking about the rest of the plans. I just assumed they were rare drops from the imposter event?
---
survival means there's no slap damage. people can kill you on sight. so it's more like pve/pvp.
---
and you also lose aid items on death. not just by player, any death.
---
I'm not one for PvP in fallout and haven't experimented with the survival mode but I hear good things. The game is definitely more stable and balanced. I agree I've been here since beta as well and at the start i wouldn't even call it a working game. I'm super happy with how hard they have been working and really hope the community gives em a bit of redemption. Not a whole lot but def some for sure.
---
Huh. I was doing it on day 1 of beta. I realized immediately that it was the best way to obtain materials, exp, farm for power armor pieces, etc. I kind of assumed everyone realized it and played that way. I mean obviously if you want to just complete the main quest, you stay on the same server, but I ignored the main quest (minus the parts that unlocked the workbenches) until later because I wanted to make sure I was as powerful as I could be as quickly as possible.
---
Yeah, I understand the issue better now thanks to all the feedback on this topic. 
---
While I know other will feel differently, I would rather work with the true carry weight than one that is temporary. I will just continue to monitor my carry weight or live with it for now.
---
I said I wasn't going to buy 76 because of the multiplayer and PVP introduction. I've also said I was going to quit playing dozens of times over the last few months but unfortunately this is the only shooter/looter game out right now.
---
I'm not a huge fan of Epic but if they can do a better job at making a balanced shooter/looter game with more than 1 or 2 viable builds I'll dump 76 in a heartbeat for it. So far 76 hasn't created anything other than a skinner box and their only solution to keep you playing seems to be to make the few drops worth finding increasingly more difficult to find.
---
Biv's the name and drinkin's the game! And I am in first place!
---
 Bring me back some l√§mp.
---
Now join the Enclave.
---
Sadly buy to play isn't enough anymore to keep an online game alive.
---
Pretty much all buy to play games; ESO, GW2, BDO, they all have some additional form of monetization.
---
Encouraging Bethesda by buying skins will hopefully make it so they won't add blatantly pay to win cash shop items.
---
I reported about how some things are getting scrapped by mistake and managed to record and replicated it the first time i tried to do so, all footage and stuff sent to bethesda, was having convo with them on the subject, then the repair kits came out and they went quiet, presumably because the ticket system is being spammed with hate now
---
There isnt a way to get the mod adter completing her quest is there?
---
What platform Donny?
---
You're going to get more caps from the event than it costs to travel a couple of times, though. 
---
I mean, it's all your choice. You can chose to be mad that the game is "taking" stuff from you, or you can do a few very simple easy things to save your junk. It's up to you. Be angry and full of hate, or take 30 seconds to do your prep work before fighting an endgame boss. 
---
As to your comment you deleted about being on an xbox, I am unsure what that has to do with anything. Do console players have slower internet than I do? I'm on satellite in the middle of no where with upwards of 1200 ping times. If it takes you longer to FT than it does me, I'm an really sorry because that must suck a LOT.
---
Oh PC
---
I went to my base and i broke down some weapons and armor before putting the junk in my stash. I then bundled my junk up and sat there talkimg to a friend for maybe 5 minutes before going to the map pressing L1 and quitting properly. I then waited for it to go to the main page of the game and closed the application. After that passed out
---
same here, the instant a workshop claim is completed i click the exit server button
---
Cool, I'm on PC also my game name is rych1981
---
You‚Äôre a perfect example of what I was trying to post originally. I was just suggesting they have human beings look into our situations. I got ripped for it lol
---
I don‚Äôt remember but I also think it could be found in lewisburg as well, I think it was the picnic blanket plan mission. It‚Äôs in the police station in Monongah
---
Huh musteve been noise
---
How about knowing what mods go on Ultracite or Excavator PA?
---
Oh cool if you want to send me a friend request I will accept when I get home :3
---
üòÜ good luck, may Atom be with you. Let me know if you ever hit max pins!
---
Stalkers just guarantees that your first VATS shot will always 100% hit, but it drains 50% of your AP bar to do so.
---
Yeah seriously, work in retail for a little while and you lose faith in anybodies ability to function as a member of society and makes you wonder how some people have made it this far in life
---
Also seriously wondering about this.
---
and then your entire stash was gone when you logged back in? or just a section of it? or something in particular?
---
Yeah that‚Äôs what I thought I‚Äôd did but it never says 100% chance
---
Thirty seconds is plenty of time for others to inflict damage to the imposter sheepsquatch. If everybody did just that, the event can be won easily :) Don't bother losing all your stimpaks, it's easier to just die and respawn, just make sure you don't take much junk with you :)
---
My base is in artillery range. Surprisingly enough, no brahmin were harmed during the strike, although it did send a few new players running at first.
---
As the master dev you should know this my man
---
It would already take the weekend to download the game for most of people.
---
Keep an eye out over on the market.. People will be bidding 15k caps, them BOOM, in i come with a 50k pin post. People will lose their minds
---
When I next log on I'll send a request :) I'm in the UK if that helps working out best times to team up
---
I would actually like someone who has used one of these guns talk about the benefits of stalkers.
---
I have come across a few melee stalkers weapons, but I'm not really sure if there is a benefit since melee is always at 95% or zero. Anyone care to talk about their experience with Melee stalkers?
---
When drinking beers at a party I tend to wake up with a pocket full of caps.....I guess I just hold onto them thinking I'm rich
---
People will lie about it being a bug becuase a lot of people are incompetent, not saying thisnis definately the case, but thats why some people would lie
---
Whole stash.
---
Is t there a Baa noise server wide when it starts? Otherwise I‚Äôm hearing things.
---
Yeah, I always have to spend like 10 - 15 minutes to find the body. But last night it dropped me a Vampire's SS Buzz Blade I sold for 5k, so not bad.
---
Ok, sounds good
---
&gt; seem to consume an alcohol in the bowl without a choice of which one
---
Ah, Russian Roulette with alcohol. Will you get +50 carry weight or end up in a ditch cuddled up with a feral?
---
Stalkers melee weapons are pointless as they are always 95% vats hit
---
No there aren‚Äôt any confirmed cases of someone getting any mounted head plans on that imposter event. Only from the investigating side quests
---
It's not the most useful perk, but it can work well with saved crits at max VATS range. 
---
Shoot, run, shoot, run, etc... lol
---
HAHAHA! You were wrong.
---
&gt;what other game subs do you lurk    
---
&gt;.  
---
&gt;stop being defensive and accusatory 
---
You're Actually serious now?  smh..
---
Also, I was answering the guy who said having a sale will make people play the game, by saying that I dont think so since even though some of us already own it, we aren't playing it. Because the issue isnt a question of price. 
---
There's absolutely nothing wrong or ridiculous about my reply, it's an opinion. Either you're obtuse or you didnt understand my initial comment or what I was responding to, which is otherwise crystal clear.
---
If you think about it.. much cheaper than the queen.  Less ammo needed, don't have to clear a silo.  I think i get better drops.  You can get the cost down to around 1700-1800 with perk card and grape mentats.
---
Somehow the holotape journal of Rosalyn was used to create Rose's personality. It seems just before the war, Rosalyn was on a tryst with a married man. If you listen to the holo, I think she seems to really like drugs.
---
I mean, i managed to recreate my bug of P/A scrapping the first time i tried to recreate it
---
Lol don't mention it too much mate we all know Bethesda likes to remove the good glitches first
---
Anyone got a pic of nukashine t60?
---
What if they pulled caps from any of the 5 characters on the account? Another alternative is big penalty for dying with no caps. I think it's 50% damage loss now but it could be even higher versus other players.
---
They're former sexbots. It's all venereal.
---
Sorry. Didn't know that. That's kind of cool to know in a way, for me anyways. I gave up on those plans because I had made the decision to never pay caps 2k in caps for an event that has no guarantee 3*.
---
I'm not opposed to this at all. Make it about the workshop and the fight and not about farming caps.
---
Can they actually see what drink is in it? If they can't I'm only loading it with nukashine lol
---
I was able to build the fancy bar items after purchasing the bundle.
---
Also don't be afraid to take a conduit.. just spam your diluted stimpaks you'll do just fine and the squatch will die faster.
---
if on PC.. please use PUSH-TO-TALK.
---
so simple.
---
Yeah that event is not worth it lol. But no it‚Äôs okay I just wanna make a discussion about it and let it be known. Hoping someone else out there knows more but I haven‚Äôt had any luck lol.
---
 I have a stalkers dragon. With sneak critical it does like 1400 dmg. Start off with a sneak vats shot then finish up with different weapon once combat starts
---
So basically your saying I‚Äôve contracted an std from a sexbot in the middle of West Virginia, after a nuke, while killing multiple infected, radiated, and diseased enemies? If so, it‚Äôs the way I wanted to goüòÇ
---
Im honestly not sure how
---
That's 35 bucks
---
I have no problem spending extra every couple of weeks to support the game but the prices imo are crazy high 
---
I still say if prices were cheaper they would sale more and actually make more money than they are now
---
I was just saying this the other day after the double exp weekend. Yeah I think this is a fantastic idea, especially after a while once they've added and fixed a lot with the game. I'd love to see regular double exp and free weekends, coinciding with sales on the game like other games do. Maybe even an overlapping free and double exp weekend to help the new players level up and to bring old people back to the game for the double exp.
---
I don't bother with mini nukes due to weight. Pretty much all other bullets are gathered up (bandolier helps) I periodically dump what I don't use in random stations suitcases.
---
Just sneak and hide if the other players are higher level as you will have no hope killing them
---
Very strange, I would've just used the Free States vendor 5ft away
---
They don't. This post is redundant.
---
I like stalking people from a distance and watching them through binoculars. It's pretty fun especially when they don't even know you're there.
---
It kinda is tho
---
Don't attack. Make sure you run up as fast as you can and mash your button to interact. You will need to be very very close. Once your interaction is successful RUN.
---
Thank you! Much appreciated..  
---
Glad to hear I've been doing it right, albeit unintentionally. :)
---
&gt; c
---
It's definitely an unintended consequence that its more beneficial to fight in adventure than it is in survival.
---
No, they can't. The guest has only the option "Drink", like if it's a water source or something. The owner can interact with it pretty much like with the destilling station.
---
Well it's not really just a joke, it's setting appropriate. Fallout's retrofuturism is based on the time period with some of the highest exposure to lead ever, in the 1950's lead was everywhere, lead paint for houses and toys, leaded gas, even the solder used in food cans. It only really began to be phased out of common use in the 80s I think.
---
You can most definitely scrap legendary items on accident if you are spamming the scrap button at a bench. You arent supposed to be able to, but you werent supposed to be able to put your TSE Handmade in the Mama Dulce's hopper either..
---
Nice assholes are fun. Not nice assholes are... well, assholes. Also, I'd find it *hilarious* to come home and find *just* my count wrecked.
---
Grafton steel then walk down hill road last building on left has knocked down corner wall. Look at lockers for plans. Dont take plan if it is not BOS plan then server hop world until it BOS plan spawns. Took me about 10 world hops today to get BOS arms plan. Easy
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/3sWh4IJ
---
I was in a discord earlier with someone doing the same.   We had to move him because he didn't have his headset on to hear us to tell him to move himself, lol...
---
So it is included but not listed, ok thank you
---
If prices were cheaper people could farm the atoms in-game...
---
I mute mine half the time because when they find. Out I'm female it turns into a witch hunt 3 times I've been set on base destroyed purely for being a girl... I know this because they had area chat and were chatting bull üòÇ
---
I'm just thinking
---
We have players, like the playerbase isn't the issue right now. Finding a group to play the game with has never been easier than right now. All the free weekend is going to do is show new players that "yup FO76 still has some of the same issues it had in the beta.".
---
The purpose of a free weekend is to entice people, show them what they're missing out on. Not show them the same things they were complaining about before the game was even released. I like F76, but getting more players in right now should be nowhere near the top of the list of things that should be done before considering a free weekend.
---
tldr: A Free Weekend right now just showcases how little 76 has actually come in terms of updates.
---
Honestly I'd love to put together a comparison showing other game launches and how much they've changed in six months compared to FO76. But it wouldn't matter because at this point I think it's just a fact that yeah Bethesda really has not put **that** much work compared to other studios.
---
It's been here for 9 hours when you posted, safe to say it's been taken.
---
Well i usually dont spam it out quickly and when im scrappijg i generally pay attention to what i scrap cause there are times where im interested in the item even if nots not legendary. Other times i keep certain things so i can sell them at the vendors.
---
it's just a texture, pretty sure every armor gets its specific one.
---
it's in the preview at least.
---
Like monthly callendar rewards? Login everyday for a unique atomic shop item.
---
Aha lots of defensive with those!
---
I don't understand why your getting down voted, that's actually a very respectable stance on this topic.
---
Honestly, I think 76 is balanced better than Borderlands 2.
---
The original Borderlands was like 76 - because Legendaries were totally random, they didn't balance the game with the expectation that you'd have them.
---
Borderlands 2 has a bit of a trolling streak.  Shields barely matter because high-level enemies can instantly sap them and % of HP.  Getting the DPUH and The Bee came down to killing the same enemy 100 times.  Fight for your life is an infuriating mechanic.  And, imo, the game isn't much fun to play solo.
---
Guy the game has been on sale nearly the entire time since it released. There was like maybe two weeks where the game was full price but everywhere it's been $30 for quite some time.
---
Lol, Nice having the sheepsquatch, fish and the rabbit at the bar.
---
I plan on being an ammo dealer. Most of what I sell will be ammo. I try to grab everything. Thanks for asking this, so I can now know what to prioritize.
---
Gimme some Slaanesh power armour with assless power chaps. I'll wear that shit all day. Change my jetpack into enormous speakers. This silence offends Slaanesh!
---
I love how you have the bunny, the sheepsquatch and the fish all watching tv at the bar!!
---
Ok.. yeah i was on open mic one night like 3 weeks after launch and forgot the game was on.. my GF and I didn't realize it was on until i heard some dood yelling "you go man get you some!" lol
---
the closest iv ebeen to his is my best friend and teammate ahd something happen to her-
---
she lost all her pieces from her x-01 PA! she just had the frame left, this happened this last weekend
---
It was just us playing since launch, so there is no reason why she'd lie to me, and she wouldnt lie anyway about anything we are good friends, plus after we had to get the supplies for the new pieces and i watched her build the new pieces
---
so, this is why i believe it, ive seen it happen to a  close friend who has no reason to lie
---
I've gotten 2-3 from most SBQ fights I've done, but not from any other source.  They really should drop from other bosses, or even higher level events, though.
---
Ehehehe excellent....
---
I don't have my level 100 achievement. It took me 4 months to get there and I don't want to have to do it again for an achievement.
---
I get it. 
---
I feel like if everything was more reasonably priced they would make more. I‚Äôd buy more furniture or furniture skins if they were $1 or $2 each. Not $8.
---
It‚Äôs just the whole : price it high so we can put it ‚Äúon sale‚Äù later mentality. 
---
I definitely don‚Äôt buy anything from the shop at ‚Äúfull price.‚Äù
---
Plague rider skin in my op is way better
---
Happened to me too. Had just placed my fully kitted out X01 armor and server crashed before i could enter - bye bye baby, never to be seen again. Would do just about anything (legal) for a jetpack
---
That thought never crossed my mind but it's a good point. Just gotta work out what's going to give the best return.
---
Fair enough. Just my opinion though.üëç
---
Well it‚Äôs the exact same model from the one in 111
---
I don't know, half my armor and my primary heavy weapon, (all 3 star perfect for MY build) were acquired via vendors, sold to them by other players. I think that's the thing. A, "good" legendary to me might be meh to you.
---
Plague rider with bone raider helm looks awesome
---
I'm a melee user, but I pick up all ammo that weighs less than .1
---
Lots of it can be used for barter, and what's not I give to noobs.
---
Yeah this happens alot in this game. The community is becoming like No Man's Sky's. It's got a long way to go but it'll get there.
---
Nurgle all day long!
---
what are you supposed to record actually?
---
once you realize the stuff is missing, how does recording yourself looking at your inventory help anything?
---
obviously the moment the things disappeared was not known to the players who lost things
---
besides, why would you save recordings if you thought everything was fine with your inventory?  the people get into the game, and then they realize shit is missing...how does recording that help?
---
the only way recording could help is if you were lucky(or unlucky as it were) to be recording, and just happened to show your inventory with the items in it, and then STILL be recording when the items go missing...
---
is this making any sense to you?
---
i guess if it happens to you, then you'll believe
---
I think you're really onto something with the art deco with a 1950's lense there. Great comment, I wasn't even considering Victorian conservatory/orangery. I would really like to replicate the farnsworth house, they already have a decent selection of modern furniture to compliment it and then I can be Batman since his house in the recent movies is/inspired by it.
---
 Fuck off somewhere.
---
Scorcj Beast: "Constant screeching"
---
Not sure why you got a pile of downvotes for this. It takes a proper adult to simply say "It's not for me as is" as opposed to the sort of rabid hate that would normally earn this sort of reaction. I still check in on EVE regularly, and havn't played in nearly five years.
---
Pretty sure if you see what they scrap into it will tell you. Titanium is excavator, ultracite is...ultracite.
---
I'd love some Civil War/War of 1812/Revolution uniforms as well.
---
Everyone else is jealous that we have choices lol
---
I am rather jealous, it has been so long since I seen a chainsaw so I will keep to my drill though I do not have all the the proper perks yet.
---
I have had 3 legendaries disappear that I use and noticed. 2 found naturally, 1 I had bought to replace the first one that was lost.  The third time I am positive that it somehow lost its legendary status as a very similar modded gun showed up out of no where. I think something similar happened before but I was paying more attention.  It also seems to maybe be tied in to the quick select wheel and having 2 guns of the same class equipped. two of these were before weapon renaming, one just after. But it seems like almost no one believes me, so none of this info gets heard. I did put in a ticket as well, but nothing.
---
I play most of the adventure game with a crafted .45 lever action.  I do not seem to have lost any armor, and the only PA part was very long ago.  This is in no way a game breaking bug. But it broke my heart to lose my regular shot explosive shotgun.  I did not use it often, but my executioners tesla rifle is not quite the same. My 3\* aa crit limb lever action was the center of my stealth sniper build.  
---
I have no reason to deface fallout, I am a fan, check my history.  I am not begging for cheap replacements, I don't tend to trade at all.  I don't pvp so my "REP" is not on the line. I don't stream so I don't need viewers. I have over 500 hours in game.  I have lost my favorite guns.  I still play almost every day.
---
Lol yeah as far as legendary drops the Sheepsquatch is pretty useless (I'm saving up all the 1 &amp; 2 star drops for the legendary vendor though) but with the well rested perk combined with the double XP weekend boost he he made for great level boosting
---
Thats the bomber jacket
---
Nah, scroll through the images on the store. It shows you it for each set.
---
I got to start my build around my newly acquired drill, repaired at 160 percent and having some good cards on and I can drill though some Whitespring gouls easily.
---
Lmao, nah. Bethesda isn't about free shit unless legal action is threatened.
---
Though letting people experience the game would be equal to the free stuff given to those who did pay:
---
Underwhelming.
---
The biggest part that Bethesda forgot to add into their slot machine was the part about actually letting the player win every once and awhile. I've got 700+ hours in the game and I'm absolutely burned out on the rare event where you see a handmade pop up in the loot pool of a 3* enemy and run to a safe spot to check your score only to find a 1* medics. I keep holding out hoping that maybe this is a mistake..... maybe next update they will fix this.......but nope.....each update seems to nerf finding legendaries more and more time the point where I'm now convinced that the team is more concerned with extending the grind than they are with creating fun content.
---
I'm at that point with 76 where the rat catches on and stops going for the cheese.
---
User name checks out
---
Fixer with the 38 cal receiver is my crap clearing choice.  I have like 10k 38 cal bullets from playing since. Xmas so use that for dealing with trash when farming or clearing a path to every armor plan in the world EXCEPT BOS armsüòÄ
---
Pretty sure the are going to be drip fed for the duration of the 'wild Appalachia' season.
---
This is similar to water purifiers. Having more just let's you build up more water before you need to empty. There's no way to make water faster.
---
Some people do, some people log off immediately..9/10 I'll do it while the owner is home. But the couch is my only target.
---
Only a complete humor-less fool would have to look up and listen to the dictionary definition of sarcasm. 
---
You were trying to make a joke and did it terribly, your sarcasm is shit man face it and move on.
---
Ouch. You on ps4? I got you
---
We have never been ok with it so we just ignore it as the prices are outrageous and underwhelming
---
true they are basicly trying to force us to buy atom
---
Perhaps they figure Raider PA is the worst, therefore skins would be less desirable, thus less profitable / too much effort.
---
Pure speculation, of course.
---
I mean its not too bad to get enough atoms for 1 or 2 through gameplay, and do you really need all of them? Seems fair enough to me
---
The X01 does not look like the pic though, its a gold helmet and the blue colored body
---
I cant wait to get more XP so I can level up and be able to do such content such as ??????????
---
(why do I want to level up a lot again?)
---
I run on team only...and for some reason, I flat out cannot ever hear other people talking who aren't on my team. Voice chat in this game is pretty broken.
---
They're my truest wasteland friends. xD
---
meh, it's not like they had warning provided and ample time to flee.
---
You got pizza? I want pizza...
---
then if it hasnt happened to you, and you are tired of these threads, why do you need feel the need to come into these threads and start shit with people, basically calling EVERYONE who has ever reported this a liar?
---
if you are "done" with it, then carry on, and let the people reporting bugs report
---
Local crafted mushrooms, right off the back of a sloth!
---
And finally an emote that actually has a new animation rather than just a new overhead.
---
No one is forcing you to buy a skin
---
They are forcing you to log in, complete challenges and save.
---
Tbh even the drill can be devastating if modded and repaired to 200%
---
Just look at this video about it
---
 https://youtu.be/H12cF0blVMc
---
Absolutely!!
---
Gotcha thanks. No wonder everyone seems to want those explosive laser rifles on the market right now
---
I think ten bucks would be fine. 14 is kinda high. But I‚Äôm still going to get that plague skin... I need to. My soul needs it!
---
True. I just have a feeling they didn‚Äôt open their map to check, assuming we were bombing WS or the queen lol.
---
ü§§ Hot damn, that's some fine wasteland livin'!
---
Oh man I didn't even realise that, I sold my two shot Cryolator because I thought it was really weak, but it's probably because I was using it against high level Super Mutants.
---
Yes! I love that it's a punch bowl and you don't know exactly what you're going to be drinking. I think they did a good job with this.
---
I agree. I really thought this one over a few ways... and then decided NOPE on the buy once I realized that:
---
A) I‚Äôm gonna want ALL FOUR horsemen sets (because 3/4 of an Apocalypse is like no Apocalypse at all)
---
B) Since they are Atom Shop buys, it‚Äôs not like I can gift the others to three of my friends anyway, and I can only wear one at a time.
---
C) There is no way I can make enough Atoms (having done all the ‚Äúeasy‚Äù stuff) in the time frame given for ONE set, let alone all four.
---
D) I usually run around in my Excavator suit anyway.
---
That first idea is worth looking into...
---
Pledge to the other West Virginians that you will not pay for atoms!
---
Gary: Gary
---
It also contains the free punch bowl, which I find hilarious for some reason.
---
Looks pretty bad ass on my t45 set.  Hold me over till Blackbird comes back.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen before and it was a beautiful sight to witness. I made myself the bad guy by emoting an angry face after a while, too committed to that particular line to find a shorter one.
---
How about no.
---
the more I think about this, it would be cool for it to be a quest reward or something. you find a guy with a note and a keycard, then you have to locate Appalachia Mini Storage and get (his random loot from his locker there) but then the locker is yours to use.
---
They‚Äôve tried to justify it by saying that it s to keep the servers running, which is a flat out lie. They made a lot of money off the sales of the game itself. More than enough to keep the servers running for years, especially since they really cheaper out on the development of the game. Most of it is reused assets from fallout 4 and other things that are copy pasted. The atom skins being limited time are just them being selfish.
---
Im not tellingnpeople to quit the game. Merely trying to grt evrry one to report it so the devs actually do something about it
---
Has there been any word on them being out yet?  Are they just a super rare Biv reward?
---
maybe wanted to see themselves vaporized, something I've yet to do, in my bucket list
---
So glad this ended up being a good story, I was waiting to hear about the one person who cuts the whole line. üòÇ there‚Äôs still good in this world.
---
Anyone get the football outfit?  Curious is the helmet is a separate item, or you have to run with both the helmet and uniform at the same time?
---
Lol i didn't even know there was one
---
I've done this too... it's amazing how confused they get. Lmao
---
Has been there since beta yea, its like in rubble
---
That's not what was said.  They *do* want you to buy Atoms to finance continued support of the game.  It's as simple as that.
---
Just don't buy them.
---
Suuuper good to know, thank you!! üôè
---
I'd love to try the game out, I'm considering buying it from a cd key reseller for cheap, but unsure if a eu or aus cd key once activated will work in NA without a VPN. I'd love a copy for $15, but not if I have to play at 300 ping lol.
---
"Limit PVP in contested workshops to the workshop alone. I personally think the workshop size is a little small for adventure fights" so the owner can cheese things by jumping in and out of the workshop radius to avoid damage and still kill the attacker. Sounds great :)
---
Where? on PC?
---
i mean the way they put every interesting stuff on a ''limited time''
---
90% of the atom shop is too expensive and I'm only spending the free atom points.
---
You arent meant to have every single skin.. plus thats a way for them to give out free DLC. Not really a huge deal
---
But there is actually one that's blank. I use the same letter set as you and somewhere near the ":" and the "?" there is one that is just white, after the letters. Takes a while to reach but you should be able to place it.
---
 Many of us will never buy Atoms. I sure won't, but I bought the Plague Rider skin as I knew it was coming and saved up my Atoms. 
---
 Cost me nothing.
---
Personally, I believe going full Unyielding is the better route. Steathboys are plentiful, and if you're running super high Agi you'll be hidden in plain sight at all times.
---
If you were to go full Unyielding, which would grant +15 to all specials minus endurance, you could reduce the amount of unnecessary perks and focus on more damage perks.
---
I guess i'll just go down the line..
---
Strength - Having 1 or 3 points is fine. You could essentially have +20 str from unyielding and Radicool (+5), so carry weight is not an issue. Carry weight perks are bad, unless you're roleplaying a mule/merchant. If you do 3 str, Blocking would be very beneficial (45% melee damage reduction). 
---
Perception - I think 9 is a good amount, although pushing the rifle perks to rank three each might be a waste of points. You could instead keep each rifle perk at rank 1 (giving 30% damage) and investing the rest into Tank Killer (36% armor reduction) and the last three could be put into whatever else (Concentrated fire, Long Shot) or even reduce perception down to 6.
---
Endurance - Everyone really looks down on this stat, despite there being some really good perks in it. Radicool gives +5 str when 50%+ irradiated. Rejuvenated gives you +50hp when fully fed, and Ap refresh when fully hydrated. Chem Fiend doubles your chem time. Fireproof reduces explosive damage by 45%, which means you can face tank scorchbeast sonic blasts and laugh as they tickle your health. I personally think having endurance at 8 is best.
---
Charisma - Perks can be swapped out whenever, so using points on perks that you'll only use rarely are wasted. Chr at 4 is good, as you can swap out to Lone Wanderer when playing solo. Also, Tenderizer and Suppressor are cool in team play.
---
Intelligence - 6 is solid. You can swap out to what you need to make and repair gear. 8 is also viable when you want to spread into other weapons.
---
Agility - 1 is much too low. Minimum 3 or 5, maximum I would say 11. Adrenaline perk is a must. Action boy for Ap regen, Marathoner if you're running a lot. Covert ops/Ninja and Sneak clear rooms of enemies with little ammo consumption."You see that scorchbeast in the air? \*pew pew\* now you don't." Dodgy is nice when you have a large pool of AP to pull from. If using VATS, Gun fu makes the game trivial.
---
Luck - Serendipity is a must. Mutation perks are a must. Bloody mess is a must. Min 11 luck. If you want to crit in vats, 14 or 15 max.
---
Gauss rifle can be a beast with the right mods. One shot, one kill with sneak crits generally.
---
It's more of a min-max opinion, so I hope it helps.
---
Or you could not take a workshop if you don't want to PVP. The ability to abandon workshops would allow someone to get out of dodge whenever they are losing a fight.
---
Level 177, been to store over 400 times, been playing since beta - still no X01 jetpack. Anyone have one for sale ???
---
üëçüèºüëçüèºtime for some inappropriate signage üòÇüòÇ
---
Maybe not... because me and my friend found him running in the zone afterward and stopping every five seconds to clearly take radaway. No protection whatsoever either too.
---
I think what would be awesome fun is to have a group of players, hardcore fallout fans and filthy casuals both, get together and do a weekly parody news show about what's going on in the game.  Set it up like a 'wasteland weekend update' including radstorm reports, fluff pieces on someone's pet deathclaw being found, wierd criptid shinanigans, and the occasional darkly humorous story about a mascot hooligan gang or the strange guy handing out trick or treat candy while naked.
---
I would watch the hell out of that, and it would be a really fun way to get a weekly review of fun and interesting Reddit and Twitter Shinanigans for the week.
---
y best friend and teammate lost all the pieces of her X-01 PA this last weekend, she still had the frame but no actual pieces...
---
so, its real, she has no reason to lie and she is not the type of person to just "forget" she removed all the x-01 pieces
---
besides, she loved that armor, we had just added the nuka cola paint on it and she was loving it!
---
AutoMod here,  
---
I've got my eye on you bucko.  
---
&gt; **If you think there is a resource that workshops provide better than farming / server hopping, post it, and I will prove you wrong.** 
---
Nuclear Waste/Material at Federal Disposal HZ-21  
---
100% Fusion Cores at Power Plants
---
Please no, I have a random event hotspot in my front yard and really don't want my home destroyed.  It's fine if it's blows up when you cut the wrong wire but let's not go crazy.
---
Lol its their servers
---
See I did this once and the dude kept griping about the crazy person just standing behind him like a stalker. He got done and walked away. Told him to have a nice day and he got very irate and started throwing out insults. Some people.
---
I want an Astartes power armor paint to go along with my Plague Marine skin.
---
You leave the contested area you lose the workshop and PVP ends. Either that or you consent to PVP and it happens anywhere or you relinquish the workshop. If you don't respond for a set amount of time you lose the workshop.
---
There are Civil war outfits. They usually spawn at historical cemeteries.
---
 I just pick up what I use. I leave the rest behind. ;)
---
You definitely can ‚Äòinspect‚Äô legendary weapon/armor mods at vendors. Just click down on the right stick highlighted over the weapon.
---
Im truly sorry your friend had to go through that. You would think there would be a system in place for these kind of situations to stop them from happening.
---
No idea. I'm wondering if they've snuck them in game today to go with the atomic shop stuff.
---
I generally don't take them - I only do when I need the daily or when I take munitions factory. When I take munitions - I stay and fight and I accept that PVP as it's worth fighting over to me. I would like the option to abandon because it's not worth my caps to die over and over for say a junk extractor.
---
Trash em. Totally worthless. Every single one.
---
Omw
---
 Its ugly. I bought Plague Rider as it was one of two I liked and it fits my X0-1.
---
Honestly i use workshops for free fast travels
---
Sorry off topic but that username tho. Hope you kill her though!!
---
This as well, but I scored a Explosive Combat Rifle I use the .38 receiver with.  Great for trash mobs.
---
I avoid all ammo I dont actually use.. any that I get by accident or for rewards I leave in containers in high traffic areas...
---
Where did you drop it?
---
The blackbird is much better. This one isn‚Äôt bad though. However I assume it‚Äôs the same as the other one, in that it changes your power armour type to look like one specific type. Which is fucking dumb tbh.
---
Purified Water. 
---
I would take workshops and put the max. I bet if purifiers in them, then spend a lazy Saturday just collecting massive amounts of purified water for selling off. 
---
I‚Äôm sure you could argue a better use of time, but I enjoyed it because I got other stuff done around the house at the same time, and it made my active playing time far more than efficient, since I could just buy bulk mats I needed while going through events and quests.
---
HM is the skin?
---
The waterpark. We wanted cobalt flux and it‚Äôs a great place to get it.
---
We need more change, the great changer  to be precise, tzeentch all the way
---
I guess.  At the same time, I find the scavenging aspect kind of appealing.  Making do with what you actually have, rather than making it easy to acquire the best of everything.
---
To go back to Borderlands, you could have the DPUH if you sat in the bar grinding Torgue tokens.  You could have The Bee if you kill the Hyperion reporter 50 times. And by the time you get to Digistruct Peak, the game *expects* that you've done that.
---
That's kinda funny, bet he had no idea
---
It includes the bar set.
---
Let it be 20 min, Imma be there
---
That is the video for me using the drill, still do not have max gladiator perks though and max artesian.
---
Would be nice if neither party could attack or take damage while on opposing sides of the radius?
---
lol yeah, I bet he didn‚Äôt even think to open his map, assuming we were just bombing the usual places. And then down that nuke came lol.
---
I lost a lot of respect for Angry Joe when he did that, and it undermined all of the good points he made about the game's shortcomings since his "burn it all down" attitude was so clearly on display.
---
What about deliberate Darth Vader impersonators?
---
Id: kilercuts
---
Got to a bathroom stall in game and then irl go take the most exaggerated shit of your life while on the mic. Perfect play.
---
It's 100% situational.... in theory, once you find your end game weapon, you only need to pick up that ammo.  I only use .45 but I pick up a variety of ammo I don't use because my friends do.  I used to avoid 5mm until a friend got a fun one, now I pick it up for him.  I have yet to group with anyone that regularly used Syringer, railway spikes, plasma cells, plasma cores, crossbow bolts, cryo fuel, flamer fuel, cannon balls, nukes, missles or harpoons....  but that could all change tomorrow if a friend finds a new fun toy.
---
While at work recently, I was in another office and without thinking, picked up a clipboard and walked out. Hoarding clipboards is almost second nature now.
---
I want more variety of Civil War uni's tho
---
Ooooooh.
---
I'm squishy as all hell, so I sit on the roof, get a tag on the ISS, and then protect the pylon guys as much as I can. Am I doing my bit right?
---
Can someone explain what I'm looking at. And what shadowplay is.
---
A bloodied ripper nodded and 200% repaired with all perks is op. Mine is only a one star, if it were a three star perfect roll it would be even more ridiculous. I think the 200% repair is bugged for the ripper, drill and chainsaw. When you 200% any other melee weapon it gets a small increase. Drills, rippers and chainsaws get massive boosts. It‚Äôll probably be nerfed at some point.
---
so the header is just showing all items added. the bundle is a small subset of those items. this has happened with other bundles as well. they don't add all the new items to one bundle.
---
Supposedly they patched that. You can't do it anymore unless you had a mask pre-patch.
---
oh I forgot about these
---
From my experience, nobody has been nice. Before slap damage was removed I got attacked in whitesprings by 5 level 50+ players. I refused to hit them back, but since there were 5,they still killed me in less than a minute, one became wanted, then they killed everyone that came to try claiming the bounty.
---
All I was doing was turning in a couple of quests.
---
There is no damage cap at 190, that is complete misinformation and you have no actual data to even support it. You even contradict yourself and say it‚Äôs still possible to 1 shot someone, and imply that it‚Äôs with multiple projectile weapons. If that‚Äôs the case then why do I 1 shot people all the time with a gauss? Oh that‚Äôs right because it‚Äôs doing 2k dmg with a sneak attack coupled with 76% armor penetration.
---
You‚Äôre just spreading misinformation man and it‚Äôs fucked up, any good PvP‚Äôer would look at this shit and just laugh at the stupidity. You‚Äôre jumping to so many conclusions.
---
2 weeks and 100+ hours eh? I have over 1500 hours played in this game, easily 300-400 of that is survival, and all that experience tells me you are gravely mistaken. 
---
You honestly seem like the type of idiot I run into in survival that keeps coming back over and over as I kill him every time. Thinking you have a chance or that you‚Äôre getting close to killing me because the server latency showed my hp bar drop to 1 on your screen but on my screen it never moved at all. One of those idiots that jumps to assumptions based on arbitrary numbers and random coincidences, instead of relying on hard factual data. 
---
There is no damage cap, sneak attacks do work, assassin wood armor is straight trash also. No wonder you think there‚Äôs a damage cap, you have shit armor.
---
You don‚Äôt even have the proper guns to test all of this. You say bloodied sucks, show me your list of bloodied god rolls, oh what you have none? Then how the fuck do you know they suck?
---
I have a list of bloodied god rolls, hell I‚Äôve got every bloodied god roll worth having except a bloodied explosive laser, and my friend has a list of full health build god roll guns. And we‚Äôve thoroughly tested every single one. And I‚Äôll tell you this, there is a discernible difference in the damage they put out, and if the damage was capped at 190, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to 1 shot a player with 460 hp.
---
I will play a PVP Season character when the option becomes available, but for now I treat survival mode like a super extra hard mode with limited fast travel and much stronger enemies.
---
The point is that you and 3 friends buy one each like me and 3 friends did with the unstoppables so we had the whole team. One person can't be 4 horsemen. I wouldn't buy any if I couldn't play with a full horseman team. Just my opinion
---
ive been having robots drop dead around me, and spawn dead, in watoga all day today
---
Not enough of a response. How long will it be now before the 75 dollar item or the 100 dollar item point is even if 99% of people don't buy it the tiny percentage of whales they are banking on might do as less people are in the pool of people they can see the mirco too they will start pulling the prices up to make up the difference.  They need to make as much money or more to make it look good to the shareholders otherwise I'm guessing there will be pressure to make the game " more profitable" coming down from the top now that fallout is a 10 euro "loss leader" in some ways.
---
Theres a event caalled free range, theres one place in forest, Savage divide and Mire where it spawns on/near a farm, Id do the froest and Savage divide one, more is bad for low lvls
---
It looks the same on all the armors, which is wicked cool lol.
---
He does that. I posted on here that I would hold one and soon as the person got there he was dead. Made me feel like an asshole üòÇ
---
You should both drink a Nukashine together and then see what happens...
---
But don't tell the co worker what it is or what it does :)
---
&gt; They do want you to buy Atoms to finance continued support of the game.
---
I will support the game, no probs with that.
---
I just am not into pimping my power armor tho, I want some good building sets. Now I know the work going into those will be way harder so I imagine they will be $$$ but having a nice shack interests me more than power armor skins.
---
I hope not otherwise it'll be the nail in the coffin for chainsaws and drills, they'll be next to useless with no point actually being in the game
---
Thanks, my mates so happy üòÇ
---
Solid idea
---
I also had something similar happen. I was checking the durability on the found piece on a frame and wanted it to look closer.  I accidentally got in the frame.  I got out, picked it up. redeployed it to remove the pieces, and it was already empty.  the pieces had un-equipped somehow.  I put out my good set and got in it to scrap that cursed set to make sure it was safe.
---
people walking through walls in survival mode to avoid taking damage, and netting freeish kills
---
Nice! I'm debating though  because there is the death rider coming out in ths shop soon and that looks dope too
---
Sorry on the delayed response here! Yes, they are included. I'll mention to the team the confusion with the text description.
---
I have an i7 and a gtx 1080 and fps is good and stable.
---
I mean hearing it... lol
---
Good bot.
---
That's good to know, I guess everyone is innocent, then.
---
Nah just for the fun, it‚Äôs not supposed to exist but it does, that‚Äôs why it cost so much (well at least I thought it‚Äôd be worth my 25k).  I‚Äôm sure I could always just mass produce misc objects but I take no enjoyment in stocking up, just about the fun guns ie. my quad crossbow, it may be a terrible weapon but it‚Äôs a lot of fun to use. And let‚Äôs be honest, does anyone really need more powerful stuff, everyone I see playing insta kills pretty much everything except ‚Äúend game‚Äù bosses.
---
&gt; or might make folks think twice about taking a KIA's junk...
---
ymmv with that
---
60% of the time, it works everytime.
---
Glad I'm not the only one!
---
&gt;Our sausages are the _wurst_
---
You can't murder a robot.
---
I'll pass this feedback along to the team!

---
That all personal preference, but I am certain they will all look the same regardless of armor. But as for me I like the War paint job, I think they have dont a very good job on it, my only nitpick would be that the gauntlets are a little strange in color compared to the red, it‚Äôs kinda an off green.
---
It's not till May, week of (hopefully) May 7-9th for player vending
---
The railroad would like a word with you.
---
I don't like it but i understand it. 
---
I got the game for ~$15.
---
When plague rider came out i made a $40 purchase. It gave me 5000 atoms.
---
So far i got the plague, war rider, nukashine and that fancy bar.
---
I will have to buy more atoms for the 4th rider, i still have enough atoms for the 3rd. anyway, let's say it'll cost me $20 more.
---
That will be a total of $75. I played the game for about 270 hours.
---
$75/270 = 0.28 cents/hour. (but by the time the 4th rider will demand my wallet i will have reached perhaps 300 hours of playtime so the $/hour ratio will be even better)
---
It's pretty cheap when you put it like that. Ofc you could get a better cents/hour ratio with skyrim or something nuts like that simply because of how many mods there are for those games.
---
I've often seen bots collapse so I'm guessing its just some sort of odd glitch that hasn't been patched yet?
---
It's too bad we can't pay a cap to lock the bathroom door
---
You sure, my friend still has his from the first few weeks, when he gets on I‚Äôll post a pic of it.
---
Furry hats on?
---
To quote William Shatner, "Get a life, will you people?" Why cheat?  So lame.
---
I didn't spend full price on FO76, only cost me ¬£25 (About $32), I rarely buy any game at full price, because I rent my games and only keep them IF I think they're worth it, and at a discounted price too!  
---
If you want to try before you buy, Give Boomerang a go (UK only)  I have used them for several years now, and honestly think they are well worth it, especially considering the cost of games nowadays.  
---
 [https://www.boomerangrentals.co.uk/](https://www.boomerangrentals.co.uk/)  
---
Oh and no I don't think FO76 needs a free weekend.
---
or your camera  :-)
---
Please! I can't tell you how many people I've suggested it to are just at the "maybe" stage, especially with the negative press at release
---
Oh, I thought they were just invisible.
---
Yes, a split community is just what this game needs, especially with the archaic trading system Bethesda has developed.
---
Makes perfect sense to divide a major source of communication for a game struggling to find solid footing.
---
I haven‚Äôt run with audio since getting the game. I kind of feel bad for being anti-social, but kind of enjoy doing my own thing.
---
Plus, (unless this comes later, I‚Äôm at lvl50) Fallout doesn‚Äôt seem to have traditional guilds, or anything to bring folks together other than events and most of the time I ignore those, except for quick ones and that mine is a pretty great feature to get up and running and the nuclear plant pumps out fusion cores.
---
I didn't even know we could have brahmin at our camps...
---
I know. I‚Äôd rather they didn‚Äôt get a hard nerf, but realistically... it‚Äôs Bethesda. Their fixes involve hard needing things instead of actually finding a real solution.
---
Thanks for the reply! Is the limitation in the infrastructure or is it a licensing issue?
---
Better everything... except food. LMAO
---
This is the best for my saloon camp
---
you're being defensive.
---
did you buy it? what about the drinks sign?
---
Have you ever played world of warcraft? The disc is irellevant, the important thing is the account key. Each account has to have a unique key to play.
---
The Bethesda website says that fallout 76 requires a linked account on he PS4.
---
Is everyone in your household on the same bethesda account?
---
name still makes me giggle..
---
It drives me nuts. Sometimes ( if your a pack rat like me) you have to sort through a lot of items and if you rush you might sell something unintentionally, which I‚Äôm sure we have all done, and that is no bueno! So I‚Äôm the same way I sit there longer and collect every single last cap!
---
That's a dumb idea, but okay. Having a plan in place before enforcing sweeping changes prevents headaches later.
---
Figure that would be obvious with what game this sub is about, but alas.
---
right but the atomic shop listing says "Get everything featured in the brew-haha event header". That header features the "Drinks Sign" but it's not in the atomic shop list.
---
Is today May 7?
---
Id be happy if I could repair it before 99.9999999999% condition.
---
nice place nigga
---
That's part of the bar set, so yes.
---
maybe they should use the money they made off the game itself like every other online game has been able to for the past two decades
---
It‚Äôs out today!
---
Maybe it's a virus.
---
Just in case you misunderstood, when he says it looks the same on al armors, he means it make all armors look like the specific version of power armor, like how plague rider made every suit look like x-01
---
Thw vendor bot is on a timer then he just dies. I have better luck at his other spawn point seems to live a little longer
---
Which you can't mention without having your comment deleted by the automod.
---
&gt; If you have an encounter with a suspected/blatant cheater, leave the server and report the player from the recent tab of the social menu. If you have video evidence, reply to the ticket in your email and submit it.
---
Best advice ever
---
I first this.
---
VATS crits already always hit so that'd be a bit redundant.
---
Do employees work for free?
---
The vendor bot has a bad case of low batteries unfortunately. I've had him randomly die on me as well.
---
Great idea, during certain events when i see someone drop dead i think about standing over bag so nobody loots it. Problem is i don't always catch the gamer tag. So how would i know when to move so they can reclaim their stuff.
---
Thank You!!! Keep being awesome!!
---
Where do you find these 'friends'? Is that a new quest?
---
ugh im sorry that happened to you...
---
2 questions, did you:
---
1)have the PA renamed?
---
2) did you add any custom paint jobs to the PA?
---
just wondering as my friend had done both of those, im trying to collect as much info as i can to narrow down the possible ways it can happen
---
if we can reproduce this then we can hopefully get Bethesda to actually address it
---
I took me a long time to find,  finally found him at the main entrance to the White spring resort,  now I've seen him these a half dozen times.
---
Found it a wavy Willard‚Äôs earlier, just went to the location and server hoped for an hour.. that‚Äôs probably your best option. 
---
(It‚Äôs next to the only car in the car park facing the entrance)
---
Once you get it, it may be worth posting on here so others can also get it too. I stood on the car for a few hours and LOADS of people from here turned up who had also been look for it lol.
---
Oh. Darn. I would have thought that it would adapt to every power armour though. An X01 war rider would be too cool
---
No i haven‚Äôt  I‚Äôve always had consoles no pc.  Sounds like you‚Äôve always had pc not consoles.  Bethesda accounts are free. Once again the disc is a disc. That‚Äôs your ticket to playing the game.
---
I have found her multiple times at the light house. She spawns on the top with her arm dangling over the edge of the railing, so you can tell from when you load in if she's there or not. Give it a minute for game assets to load though.
---
Also if you're server hopping and keep getting placed on the same servers don't be afraid to try a survival server, they are separate so it's a guarantee different server from adventure.
---
I was waking by an auto parts store, saw the brightly colored plastic bottles and thought: plastic and oil! Look at all of it!
---
Can you serve nukashine to get rid of people from your camp?
---
I am OK with it to the point where I will probably buy atoms for it.
---
im sorry that happened to you, my teamate lost all the pieces of her X-01 PA this last weekend, but she still had the empty frame!
---
I have feeling i made 13000 atoms by playing, hoe much money did i did?
---
It was thought that it would be another Biv reward but I haven't gotten it myself yet or have seen anyone else get the plans so I have a feeling they just aren't in the game yet
---
I'd also like an image of whatever CAMP item a set of plans gives. Sometimes there's a lot of ambiguity between the name in the CAMP interface and the plan name.
---
Sick, I‚Äôll check it out! Thank you!!
---
My brother and I bought an online copy on my PS4 account and we play together all the time via game share. Maybe it's different on PC idk.
---
It just tells you the mods name no description of what they do and often times what they are for.
---
But if this game goes free toxic players will come, so I say no
---
Happened to me the other night. Only I was lvl 22 and it was near 'Top of the World'. Luckily I was on the edge and I saw it coming when I looked up at one point. Ran like a mofo
---
Yeah, it's a whiny plea for help. I'm not going to spin it as anything different, but come on, it's a POS gun. Why make it so hard to learn?
---
Yes. You have my vote.
---
Why protect a duch bag leave his name in they are clearly fuck wits
---
At least your not Clayton Biggsby!
---
No prob dude, If your on Xbox hit me up soon
---
Kinda annoyed that the free punch bowl is included in the nukashine bundle
---
Yeah there‚Äôs this random encounter where you can find an undetonated nuke buried halfway in the ground. You can interact with it and it prompts you to choose a wire to cut. If you cut the wrong one, the nuke blows up. But the explosion is only about the size of a car exploding
---
That's just old school pressure selling and it works so goddamm well on certain people who like to have the "whole collection" that is really should be illegal.
---
 Personally, i really don't see it too far off forcing a gambling addict to sit through a couple of hands of blackjack to start the game compulsive behavior should really not be used to make a video game profitable.
---
For info on how a decent company of human beings does this kinda thing go look at warframe they took a microtransaction out of the game due to the fact one dude had gone apeshit on it and spent a couple of thousand dollars or something on it ( [https://kotaku.com/warframe-removed-a-microtransaction-because-a-player-us-1824002323](https://kotaku.com/warframe-removed-a-microtransaction-because-a-player-us-1824002323) ) 
---
Fallout 76 will burn its player base before long with this endless chasing of microtransactions and the next payday personally I'm waiting for the modded servers and from that point on I'm fairly certain it will all be ok with the unofficial patch teams magic liberally sprinkled over everything. The only issue is that right now Bethesda is unlikely to want to allow that to happen as skins are pretty much the most basic of mods and people who make mods tend not to want paying for them. (creation club garbage aside) Weird isn't it when the best chance of saving the game and cutting off Bethesda's source of easy money in skins and other basic as hell to implement stuff are one and the same.
---
Well, I was online last night from about 8:30 on. Ended up helping noobs all evening, but kept waiting to hear from you so I could make a run toward watoga.
---
And our characters!
---
We have Famine (T-51 style Pale Rider) next I believe May 7th and then the T-60 Black Rider after that on May 14th
---
So if that one doesn‚Äôt take your liking there‚Äôs still 2 more.
---

Heh... I get what you're trying to say about the limitation of what was implied, but crap, man... if you think you have property rights just because you're the mod of a sub, then you have some serious conceptual issues of your own.
---
the model on the Power armor changes, it looks more like a spiffed up T45 but maintains the stats of the armor used on
---
alright, cheers!
---
What platform are you on?
---
This promotes killing low level players for scrap. Many people PVP for different reasons. Some do it for profit. If we can't get cap rewards from high level players, then we would have to get it from junk from any level players.
---
[](/kcelestiacampeverfree)Why stop there? Dual wield everything, double the guns, *double the fun!*
---
I want to be able to duel-wield boxing gloves. And then get a mod where you strap combat knives onto the gloves. 
---
I've probably been playing too much Dead Rising 2...
---
Yeah I've been waiting for this one for my X01 but if it's different than shown idk if I wanna buy it.
---
Let me ftfy. ONE screw....
---
No such thing as a two shot vampires handmade
---
I get it. They're priced the same as other PA paint schemes (which is already too high, but at least it's consistent) and maybe I'm alone in this, but I just don't re-paint my PA very often. I've got four sets and I've painted each of them once. The limited stash size means that unlike FO4, I'm not going to be hoarding different sets so I can have all the paints on display. So the horsemen collection boils down to four different options and I'm picking one, not four and I collect 'em all.
---
and my deathclaw gauntlets...
---
Time to move.
---
I'm in Canada and ours is plastic.
---
I really wish the money in 76 was as plastic well, I need more shotgun shells!
---
*ghoul.
---
You still have it?
---
Xbox
---
Omfg, the game would totally need a boxing ring event
---
Protip: Switching weapons instantly reloads single-shot weapons
---
Suddenly that Dragon's lookin good. Still breaks after like 3 shots though
---
Yeah, god forbid the for-profit business attempt to turn a profit!
---
I don't have an issue with actual PvP gameplay. It can be somewhat exciting to do and watch even. It's not fun to watch a lvl 200 light up a lvl 40 over and over while calling him a loser though.
---
It has been pretty good for me as of late. Still the occasional stutter here and there. I did notice last night my FPS was maintaining better in one of the heavier spots (Whitesprings).
---
Had a guy on mic blasting real shitty music. I asked him to turn it down and he just turned it up laughing saying "fuck you"
---
Gotta love the inbred morons out there.
---
Oh if only.
---
--close
---
This is actually a very good idea.  Maybe open the "weekend" up starting Thursday night for players to download the game (a substantial amount of time needed) so that they can start playing on Friday.
---
I prefer the Nurgle one released last week. 
---
I almost feel like a proper Plague Marine. Just need a bolter and I'd be set. :p
---
i have area chat off, but if I heard that, I would have killed all the brahmin myself.
---
Still waiting on drinking animation
---
You can save some material costs by making and salvaging lower lvl'd ones.
---
I tried that approach, the reddit/bethesda mods remove the post
---
BTW it looks like they did the same thing with the war rider skin that was released today!
---
Dual two shot explosive flamer. "The server destroyer"
---
I‚Äôm on XBone and prefer to chat via ‚ÄúParty‚Äù and have the In-Game settings off. Added benefit - I stay in touch with friends who aren‚Äôt on my team or aren‚Äôt on my server.
---
I Cary a AAE radium rifle just for people like him. ;)
---
I love this and plan on using it constantly, instead of the creepy "come here pal...." wave, or shooting at a loot bag.
---
I run a melee build for 2 handed weapon. On strength I have, level 3 expert slugger, master slugger, incisor, barbarian, and martial artist. I also have level 3 party boy and always keep a ton of whiskey on me for +6 strength. I also run the professional drinker perk under endurance. This probably isn‚Äôt the best build but it‚Äôs worked for me so far.
---
Someone claimed it had blue torso.. Have to wait and see if we get a pic of it here :)
---
Glad you like it.
---
***I personally hate it***
---
Daedric armor has no place in Fallout ‚Ä¶  particularly this early when there is still so much FO lore potential. 
---
Time to unpimp the armor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1MNEqCr748
---
So the bar set is in it right?
---
Exactly.  The main viewerbases for these people seem to not want to see good fights but these guys pwning noobs
---
HAPPY FAUSCHNAUT!!! MERRY FASCHNAUT EVERBODY!!!!
---
Creased :D
---
Oh I hope not :( I thought from the images we saw before that it was all black with gold accents?
---
I started emoting and t bagging. And I usually do because of things like that but yesterday some guys were needing help with the event so I turned it on. Now it‚Äôs going back off for a long time
---
Name it the (A)nti (A)sshole Radium Rifle. (:
---
When people complain about folks not playing miced up, this is why I don‚Äôt play miced and keep the chat off. 
---
Jackwagons like the one you described... and kids
---
I get the feeling Bethesda artists are Warhammer fans. The previous armor skin was Nurgle inspired. Now we get Khorne and Black Legion/Iron Warriors?
---
That's so stupid.  Why protect them when caught.
---
Nah man, purified water is important. I use lots of it for my bloodied build to make diluted stims / rad-away. And for drinking obviously. That said.. I have two camps (play with 2 accounts) and have 10+ industrial purifiers at each in the water. Come back once an hour to like 50 purified water at each camp.
---
( on Xbox) I have my old pics and the ones taken with the new camera
---
Forgot to put scrapper on, fuck.
---
i use your sub over the other, sucks that the good trading sub is being censored here and the sketchy and wayyy overpriced one is allowed to be borderline spammed here
---
Haa! Love it! Going to be the first thing I do tonight.
---
Hmmm. I kinda wish it was PA specific.  Its a T45 skin right?
---
Holy crap, I can't believe I've never heard that before.
---
Changing weapons is still so slow I suspect it's difficult to exploit with most weapons though.
---
I have a really nice shot gun with the bullets exploding for area damage and it broke right when one of the Brahmin was about to die so I got out a different weapon and he starts saying it was all my fault and I didn‚Äôt do anything and blah blah blah. I killed at least 4 on my own :/
---
It looks to be:
---
Football uniform (reg 700)
---
Nukashine skin for brewing station (reg 500)
---
Punch bowl (which is free...)
---
White croc camera paint (reg 500)
---
Nukashine hat (guzzler hat with two on the side)(reg 300)
---
Bargain if you want it all, but I only want the station skin.
---
Bar set 700, PA 1400, these bastards may finally get some RL cash out of me if next few weeks are solid items.  I‚Äôm all for it if they are good though.
---
Can't wait for the Monster Hunter crossover! I do really like the armor.
---
That is what the atoms shop pic shows us but who knows..
---
Agree with you 100%
---
Yeah, people always blow those cars up for no reason... I always blow them up before entering the houses.
---
Nuclear waste is really easy to farm from bloated glowing ghouls at whitesprings. Does require server reloading with a friend (or a second account), but very worth it. I have 5,000+ nuclear waste saved up. I sell in bulk if you're interested, 3c per, will sell all but 500 of it.
---
Agree on Fusion Cores. But like I said, I took all 3 power plants, sat on them for 10 hours, cleaning them out every 20 minutes or so, and at the end I had 300+ fusion cores. That was 2-3 months ago, haven't had a need since then, and I've evern turned 100 of them into ultracite fusion cores for whenever BGS makes armor pen work with energy weapons.
---
Crossbones
---
That looks so awesome. Now you need capture a Sheepsquatch vs. Mirelurk Queen or a Behemoth.
---
I never expect credit, but a double atoms week would be nice, especially if they do this again with impossible challenges.
---
Yep.
---
Couldn't you just spam collect dirty water in a river
---
g2a.com and others look on google, i payd 12‚Ç¨
---
Thank you for responding, have a nice day
---
Too bad the majority won't know what a bunch of charlatans and scam artists Bethesda has become. Why would you all continue to support this company at this time? Nothing short of full refunds should have been accepted for one of the worst major title launches in history. You all havr just told them that it is ok for companies to release unfinished games.
---
The beer keg that is unobtainable currently also has this functionality
---
Noice thanks
---
PC, but don't worry dude. Only 325 days left !
---
Alternatively just remove PvP from adventure mode entirely.  If you want to PVP then play Survival mode.  No more easy caps/junk for cowards.
---
I'd kill for a death rider paint on x01, with the engraved design on it aswell
---
Does it have the same problem as the the fermenter? I mean what ever you put in weights 1?
---
If you want to sell acid, I'll buy, 3c each. I can never have enough acid =)
---
I run t51 torso,arms, and helmet. T60 legs. They are like steel, plastic, and aluminum to repair.  T51 legs need a ton of springs I think.
---
Man. Yeah, I hate it when people can‚Äôt just enjoy the game. It is a game after all. I‚Äôm fortunate enough to have a rather large group that I regular with. Usually people aren‚Äôt an issue. What platform are you on?
---
Nono, I mean what mods (for what PA) you can put on those two. I never know if I can use T-45 mods on Excavator because any I pick up will not install on it.
---
Damnit man!!! These item keep getting g better and better!! If they keep this up people, like me, will have to buy atoms to get this cool stuff! Ugh my wife‚Äôs going to be pissed!!!
---
It changes the model, not really paint it. Just put it on my Excavator and it looks like the pic.
---
Yes, Bethesda accounts are free bit the games attached to the account are not. And I am way familiar with consoles, but this not just a console game, it is an online game that is tied to an account.
---
Yup. Intersub drama.
---
So you‚Äôre not proving me wrong then?  :)
---
Yeah, they do use springs, I've been mainly using a full set of T51b for a while now
---
Unless you want to run around looking like a child of Nurgle or Khorne....
---
When you get a chance could you post a pic?
---
I think in order to implement this Bethesda would need to try to make workshops more appealing to win over. The easiest way to do that would be to increase materials generated per hour AND increase how much the extractors can hold at one time. Anything less than 100 storage can be easily done by looting instead of defending/building/fortifying your workshop.
---
Now that people are prepared for it hopefully won‚Äôt be those saying they didn‚Äôt read the fine print like last week.
---
Yeah it sounds like it, you absolutely need two copies of the game on PC to do this.
---
Yeah Bethesda has gone full horse armor crazy again
---
I think they are focusing more on the ATOM store than fixing the servers or the many many bugs
---
Waaoaoooooooo.....
---
misc structures
---
misc tab
---
I've never seen them even try to enter, they stand off in the distance and slowly whittle away at the walls, most enemies attack crops, or anything Electrical, mole rats occasionally Chew my Door down to get inside and attack the workbenches, if they survive the nearby Mirelurk Queen, Hermit Crab, Gulpers, SuperMutants, and Oh yea, did I mention there is a Fissure near my Camp.
---
Yes it does.
---
Do you have images of it in game?
---
Whats that reward? I will probably gonna pass this one, too much effort.
---
That I agree with. I take Hemlock Holes for acid and that's it... everything else is easily obtainable in a fast loot run.
---
Shit I forgot about this and was saving for that atom PA paint, looks like I'm waiting for this now.
---
It's a solo event really, bring some cripple and the squatch(s) can't do anything but the quill thing. The cows take a bit of damage from insects but that's it. I do the one across southern belle motel.
---
Did have one guy give the frowny face emote as I was leaving (he showed up too late). I chalk it up to riding the short bus, it's easier than trying to understand.
---
Nothing grinds my gears more than trying to complete quests and being attacked.
---
Because nobody runs around in normal armor anymore. Its inferior in every way because of the awful balance in this game.
---
Not only does head armor not do anything normally, the highest DR armor in the game doesnt even outsqueeze low level mk1 power armor.
---
Marneus Calgar?
---
I‚Äôve done that and actually started a trend just like the line OP talks about! I had 3 people sitting by the time my turn was ready
---
I‚Äôve had mine destroyed a few times. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm always in high traffic areas, though.
---
You just found 220k ultracite ammo? Just out in the open?
---
Ok, I‚Äôll send you the clip tonight. Give me a few hours.
---
It‚Äôs just the white springs area, recently moved my camp into the golf course and It‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs Literally a neighborhood without neat rows.
---
The fixer ?
---
A switchblade with a junkies prefix
---
i bought it and see this now.. disappointing :/
---
the title is horrifying to read and hurts my tiny brain
---
Yea I agree, I had the same thought when I missed the first Easter egg!! Hope Bethesda take note of this post!!
---
No this was just a partial set found in the wild. My set is painted, and frame named
---
The BlackRider will look exactly as is for all Power Armors luckily which is basically 280 Atoms per skin, unless you mean an X-01 specific design?
---
They spawn on a random encounter where you find a dead trick or treater
---
So if someone is losing and wants to avoid dropping their junk they can duck outside the radius and waste the attacker's caps. Makes perfect sense. Not everyone attacks a workshop because they want the workshop :)
---
The disc is the proof of purchase the same way a pc key is. The difference is that as long as you make a bethesda account and link it to your psn you can use the same disc as someone else. It's unfortunate that the pc key is consumed but that's just the side effect of digital in this case.
---
This eliminates all surprise from PVP. You already agree to PVP when you take the workshop in the first place.
---
No one is forcing you to buy skins. You dont need them. So stop whinging about how "expensive" it is and go back to playing the game.
---
I foud the mask on a shelf at Freddies House of Fears.
---
Have not found the rest of the outfit yet, but there is a locked room on the roof to which I haven't found the key, so obviouldy, IDK whats in there....
---
Wee-oo-wee-oo-wee-oo
---
Hopefully lol, some skins for the marine armour would be awesome too. Personally I‚Äôd live the wasteland wanderer style skin from the PA for it, that‚Äôs just personal preference though.
---
X01 specific. They should have made them unique for each PA set, e.g. having a T60 plague rider
---
I think what he means is it looks the same on ALL power armor ‚Ä¶ T45, T51, X01, etc
---
radioactive incubator to make baby deathclaws and snallygasters
---
The snallygaster's do not give you 150-200 acid on a Toxic Larry run, more like 80-100 if you're lucky.
---
Smelting lead and iron ore is definitely worth it. 30% proc on super duper is extremely low, no idea where you got that number from. I average 60-75% easily.
---
Keep in mind you say killing things for the junk is the way to go. If you're not running melee, then you're using ammo. That is not factored into your net gains at all.
---
Do you have any mutations such as Plague Walker?
---
I don't think it's worth the hassle of taking a workshop for it, and if you're just doing it to vendor purified water, there are far better uses of your time. Plus, how much does it cost you to get all those purifiers up and running? There are much easier ways to max out your vendor caps every day x5, like crafting certain items, or bulking things (I tend to have ridiculous amounts of glass, leather, plastic, and bone which I bulk and vendor, or ionized meat, glowing blood, etc.)
---
You'd be far better served setting up camp at one of the ponds (there's one south of Twin Lakes marker on map where my alt's camp is set up) and putting down like 20 industrial water purifiers.
---
If you really needed MASS quantities of purified water (we're talking if you had a need for thousands of purified water every day, for what I cannot imagine), then yes, I could see taking every workshop for the sole purpose of putting down water purifiers.
---
Quick fix +1 end and ss
---
Someone attacks the workshop and is well within the radius. You rush to the edge and stand slightly outside it while they shoot. When they reload, you step back inside after enjoying your invulnerability and waste them. That's just one of the many problems with your scenario.
---
I believe I got mine from a Treasure Dig in the Mire, but it could have been off the Random Trick-or-treater.
---
I found her in front of the appalachia cemetery .
---
I had a whole set of t51 for awhile but it seems my leg pieces took the most damage and were expensive to repair. I put on the t60 legs and life was a lot easier. When they are painted up you can't even really tell.
---
So you don't have to enter an account key at all? 
---
And obviously you are not purchasing it if you are using it multiple times
---
 So if someone is losing and wants to avoid dropping their junk they can duck outside the radius and waste the attacker's caps. Makes perfect sense. Not everyone attacks a workshop because they want the workshop :)
---
there's still slap damage...never go afk unless you are crouched in a remote location.
---
He could have been hit by one of your mutations, like electrically charged. It's a cheese tactic to engage someone in PvP. Works particularly well on afk people
---
yeah im a sucker for CAMP building stuff...but only if i have the ATOMs i got for free in game
---
Could i ask where the trick or treater spawns? Is it the same place on the highway as the dead witch?
---
Thank you, I'll have to start Bucket List quest tonight üòéüòéüòé
---
Buzzblade is the best. Sliced through queens with that thing
---
I‚Äôm not sure it could be. I‚Äôve never found it before.
---
No we attack the workshop because we want PVP. I'd rather do that in survival if they up the caps loss.
---
I found mine at a random encounter following the road between the Hunter‚Äôs Shack(Queen of the Hunt) and Freddy Fear‚Äôs House of Scares on a TrickorTreater which you can get the witch outfit plans to spawn from as well but takes a bit of server hopping
---
Yup, I see where youre goin on that, hasnt done it before though but im sure its possible, youve seen that flag someone?
---
Two things:
---
1. Stop giving a damn about what others opinions are.
---
2. If it interests you, try it for your self.
---
You will free yourself. There are so many great games, movies, books and interests out there, which the mainstream masses ignore or dislike. You don't have to be a lemming, you can exercise free will. You are your own person.
---
I'm so sick of the internet hype crowd. For example I personally think the Avengers sucks ass, I haven't seen all 57 of their movie hero franchises so I can't even relate to half the super heroes in the movie because I have no idea who they are and honestly don't care. I'm not renting every movie just to understand the stupid scam. The memes get tiresome and we are all playing right into Hollywood's hand by promoting their product.
---
Maybe that particular brahmin was his ‚Äúspecial friend‚Äù? We all get lonely in the wastelands lol.
---
Go to the water park in Grafton, if you don't see the body just quit and join another server. I found it after 2 hops (he can spawn all over the map, but it's cheaper to just sit at a known spawn and log in/out until he pops up)
---
Better for a first strike and then trigger the crit i guess that way you get 2 shots off with near certainty of good hits on both with the right gun that could well be more than enough damage to get the job done but its very very much a situational thing if you don't get the drop on them its useless and if you are already in range where you would have scored a vats hit anyway its just costs you more ap on your first shot.
---
But yeah it really is one of the low prioty items for me i've got a lvl15 pump shotgun i was using for a little while on my baby shotgun build that had it on but being a shotgun that pretty much made it kinda useless at the ranges where the +100% (so double the shown chance to hit not gains 100% accuracy outside of combat :( ) is useful to push a hit into the likely to hit numbers i'm far enough away that the shotgun will only do scratch damage.
---
I am aware of that - I don't shy away from PVP myself but I understand why some people would want to. Especially if you're just doing a challenge and not taking it for resources. But I guess server hopping is really an integral part of 76 now.
---
The bar set is in it too, although the text doesn't mention it.
---
Yes. It counts as returning fire. Someone saw you afk and took the chance. Free caps and junk, what's not to love?
---
Someone had a lengthy post last week about the same thing. I think a Fallout 76 app with access to the atom shop would be a great idea.  Maybe allow you to check the map while in game.  Definitely a good idea!
---
I disagree, with legandary effects regual armor can be far superior to PA in all but rad resist. That is not including perks. With my full marine vanguard set and barbarian I have higher dmg resist than in my xo1. Not to mention the sentinal on every piece of my set. I am almost unkillable outside of my PA
---
Guess it just doesn‚Äôt work that way for consoles.  The access to play is on the disc.
---
thanks for the info, i hope it never happens to you again!
---
Yes. It shouldn't imo but it does.
---
Yes jerks do ruin things for everyone :/ it's hard to come up with solutions to help everyone when people literally spend their time thinking of ways to bother other people
---
All PVP in survival has a surprise element. Why does that matter in adventure?
---
Rules against naming and shaming are common on sub reddits devoted to games
---
I wouldn't be mad if the cost was reduced to like 1000 caps, mainly to encourage more players to start it more often.  I'm guessing many "high end" players just don't really care because they either got the costume they were looking for, or the event isn't really worth the effort for a guaranteed 3star, when a random Angler in the mire has the exact same chance as the Impostor to drop great weapons or armor.  Sometimes I'm just into the challenge of not dying while maintaining all three pylons, but not lately.
---
If you don't feel comfortable starting the event with the idea that you may have to do the lion's share of the work, save your cards for nights and weekends when more high level players are available to participate.
---
You can always server hop after a completion and find a fresh server to burn through all your cards in an hour or two.  You'll have all the Central American Drug Lord fedoras and furry costumes you could ever need.
---
That being said, it's really, really easy to make 1400 caps a day just selling crap you can pick up off the floor and looting bodies.  Harper's Ferry come to mind as the easiest source of caps, with the vendor being right in the middle of a lot of action.  There's assault rifles, shotguns, laser guns, combat rifles, chems, meat, etc all over the place if you loot all from your slain foes and pick up random guns and aid items (plus whatever legendary stuff you find).  Haul it over to Wallace and unload.  The addition of the burrows makes it even easier.  A whole bunch more extra chems and gold/silver/electronic scrap.
---
A long time ago, we were in ventrilo during a raid in wow. All of a sudden, a guy who on the channel apparently forgot he was on a hot mic, because he called his girlfriend and starting getting a little "risque". We let it go for about 5 minutes, before we all busted out laughing like mad.
---
That would have been nice, however I think their reasoning for it was to give unique designs to the 4 Horsemen of the Apocalypse in Fallout Shelter and convenience to PA users who main a specific set so they don‚Äôt have to get jetpack and shocks for another set
---
yeah enemies do this sometimes, and it seems so do friendly vendor bots!
---
This. Just stand beside a stream and spam the collect button. Should be pretty easy I would think.
---
X-01, via /u/vernon_trier:  [https://imgur.com/a/7Iqb5FM](https://imgur.com/a/7Iqb5FM)
---
Experiential learning.
---
First thing that popped into my head,  thumbs up.
---
Not too keen on survival. Hate dropping aid items and the tedium of stashing them.
---
Is that easily solvable by making the PVP anywhere if they engage within the workshop radius?  In other words, if the fight starts with both parties in the workshop it continues everywhere until it's taken. If it stays contested the fight continues everywhere.
---
[](/celestiasup)Now if you could just find two of those now that they don't drop.
---
I may actually get that one. I don‚Äôt need *every* skin.
---
Missile Turrets  are helpful, but rarely kill a SB by themselves before being destroyed, I have 5 around my Camp so 2 or sometimes 3 have a shot, but unless I'm there to help they usually get busted.
---
I would love an app to check like in game trading + the atom shop - perhaps a way to move items between characters / stash?
---
I server hop to kill people at workshops personally ;)
---
[Dwayne Schrute](https://imgur.com/pAWxY9Y) approves.
---
Oh, yeah fallout 76 definitely is the only online game with an ability to spend real money inside the game.
---
What year do you live in ?
---
thanks, it's not so clear because it's a set of items within a bundle and everything is all over the place
---
Or be moved, by Atoms glow.
---
Moments like that make the game real!
---
I attack the workshop because I have 15 mules and I want your junk :P
---
I found it on the secind place I checked. Landview Lighthouse.
---
Fair enough... we're coming at this from different angles because I don't play much survival. I'll let other adventure players weigh in.
---
Yeah I suppose so. They could have made PA mods universal to fit it
---
You sound like one of my friends - he calls it the West Virginian Roundup or something - server hops til he gets to a server full of taken workshops and goes to town. He can't cut it in survival tho lol
---
Agree, people should get a free opportunity to see that all the negative press is either BS or the problems are now solved.
---
I think the plaguewalker/electrically charged exploit only works if the opponent is wanted. Being wanted is handled like you attacked everyone on the map with a duel request. The moment you get damaged, the fight is on.
---
I replied to your other post. I want the fight, you want the junk. ;)
---
And if the fight starts with the owning party outside the radius?
---
Cant remember the quest off the top of my head but im pretty sure its during the Enclave questline
---
Inside.
---
I love survival except the aid loss.
---
I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre playing but it ain‚Äôt FO76! Massive changes in the past 6 months, more than any other game I‚Äôve played.
---
Well, camp purifiers are still slower because it‚Äôs one water per tick for the camp, as opposed to say 9 waters per tick at a workshop.  
---
Setup cost wasn‚Äôt an issue when I could spend 9 hours on one server just collecting water every 10 minutes (2 cap per small purifier, or 18 water, about 100/hr with not being perfectly efficient) while I also was productive outside the game.  But these days, good luck holding a workshop for 9 hours without ‚Äúraider RP‚Äù. 
---
In any case, moot point for me.
---
You get the power armour plans for completing the excavator quest.
---
Completing Miner Miracles unlocks them in Build Mode. Also I think they are found in Whitesprings or Enclave store.
---
It's included in the bundle, but the light up marquee letters are a separate purchase. Now we just need fancy wood panel walls...
---
Nope, it's from the Excavator quest.
---
I got mine at the end of the Excavator power armor quest
---
Thanks all!!
---
Sounds good in theory, but Unyielding Armor would abuse that with the 15 extra points on all but Endurance.
---
I'm fine with it the way it is. I've been attacked at my CAMP when I had a workshop. No issue with it. I agreed to PVP when I took the workshop. Plus, it gave me an opportunity to lead them through a bunch of traps in my CAMP :P
---
Personally I don't know how much I like this because it might be too much - because my character has like 36 strength and I feel like it could give you some advantages over people/builds? And how does the game determine which cards to put back when your chems wear off? As of right now when you move a point when actually leveling - it just picks one - so we'd have to spend even more time micromanaging the perks since there's not a quick switch system at this point.
---
&gt; Where can power armor station plans be found?
---
You can get them off of vendors occasionally or complete the Miner Miracles quest.
---
It's a simple quest plus you will learn how to craft Excavator PA
---
wait, which drinks sign are confirming being in the bar set? A) or B) ? [https://imgur.com/a/JDWuXyu](https://imgur.com/a/JDWuXyu)
---
Does the short bus explode if you shoot the engine :D
---
I honestly have no skin in the adventure game so my opinion is really just a accumulation of what I read. I do like the trap idea though!
---
40 000 000bottlecaps and you are gtg
---
The unyielding stuff gives you +3 to each stat. That would allow you to put on 15 extra perk cards......I just don't think that's a good idea.
---
I believe the special stats should give you a tangible damage increase the same way strength increases boost melee damage. For example:
---
S-Strength-melee weapons
---
P-Perception-rifle weapons
---
E-Endurance-heavy weapons
---
C-Charisma-explosive weapons
---
I-Intelligence-energy weapons
---
A-Agility-pistol weapons
---
L-Luck- ?? (what am I missing?)
---
Hopefully the new legendary player addition they teased gives us some new skills or perks.
---
So it replaces the model to the shown PA?
---
Oh really!  Good to know I may pick it up if that is the case.
---
Ah fair enough, you can buy it from the bunker though right?
---
Some of that initial criticism was deserved, but I think at this point the new player experience will be quite different from the game at launch.
---
Yeah now I think about it.
---
Floors and stairs are about it.  You used to be able to use an exploit to stack foundations, but that was patched a while ago.
---
Yeah you can, think that's the only place you can buy it.
---
What about when Legendary Players is a thing that players get to add points to their SPECIAL up to 20 but only for a maximum of 10 extra perk points? 
---
Example Level 50 = S14 P9 E7 C5 I6 A5 L8 
---
And at Level 60 = S16 P12 E7 C5 I10 A6 L8
---
I get wrecked by turrets at workshops now but I personally don't use them at my camp since they eat up so much budget.
---
I really want to try it out and play like the ultimate life or death hide and seek.
---
Not much. Dense torso is the only one with much demand and it‚Äôs fairly often for sale in Watoga, so it‚Äôs not especially rare
---
And I thought I've seen all the animals in this game. Seems like there are a lot of rare ones.
---
That's what the plague rider did, so I imagine it will be the same for all of them.
---
Tell me you tried it with high radiation fluids &gt;.&gt;
---
No there isnt
---
Only if the attacker is wanted, but yws
---
No, its a skin that replaces any power armor series, raider through X-01.
---
Close the application, test your internet connection then boot the game up again
---
I've taken to leaving them in the trash cans outside of the Artisan's Corner. Pok√©mon taught me to look in the trash, Fallout76 is making me put stuff there.
---
Bought it new for 11¬£ on UK amazon. No point getting it on PSN.
---
Thanks.
---
The dense will sell the other two won‚Äôt
---
1k is fair enough. 1,500 and 500 would be acceptable too.
---
The stats stay the same, it just reskins to look like the picture. You could skin a full raider set to look like war, but it keeps the low DR. My friend put Plague on his ultracite.
---
It would definitely encourage me to roleplay as Ashley J Williams more often
---
*Howdy neighbor, sure is a scorcher out there! If it's not too much trouble, you've not been picking up after your super mutants...They're starting to attract mole rats. ^^^Thannks.*
---
My pal does like 1,500 damage a hit with just one power fist, not including 3x sneak attack damage, booze or chems.  Giving him a second just seems mean-spirited.
---
Giving the option to gladiator and gunslinger builds seems like a good way to bring those two builds up into the "strong" category.
---
Thanks, that is the way it is supposed to look but looking for ingame pics :) Someone claimed on other post that is was nothing like this.
---
Must.....have.....complete.....set.....waooooaeo
---
Most people are pretty decent. Sometimes I get a little crabby over the mic when guys are blasting legendaries with TSE's or bloodied melee. That's about it.
---
If I get some knucklehead like that I just block them.  There's always 10 pct of assholes out there.  We need a F-off emote. lol
---
&gt; The snallygaster's do not give you 150-200 acid on a Toxic Larry run, more like 80-100 if you're lucky. 
---
Note that I said 150-200 acid in 30 minutes, not per run. The snallygasters give 5-8 acid per, which comes to about 18-20 acid per run on average, but you can easily do 10 runs in 30 minutes. Hell the only part that takes up any time at all is waiting for them to appear. Killing and looting is trivial.
---
&gt; Smelting lead and iron ore is definitely worth it. 30% proc on super duper is extremely low, no idea where you got that number from. I average 60-75% easily. 
---
Super Duper literally says 30% chance. "When you craft anything, there's a 30% chance you'll get double the result!". It's entirely random obviously, but over time it evens out.
---
&gt; Keep in mind you say killing things for the junk is the way to go. If you're not running melee, then you're using ammo. That is not factored into your net gains at all. 
---
Crafting steel is worth it in terms of caps cost (compared to buying steel scraps) if you are buying all materials from players, but only just barely, and if you get bad RNG on Super Duper, you were better off just buying steel at .5c per. It's definitely not worth it in terms of time required to farm the iron ore and/or farm / buy acid. Time is money, friend =). It "costs" me 1-2 5mm rounds or 3-4 .50 Cal rounds to kill a lvl 68 super mutant. I trade all of my spare ammo looted from enemies for .50 cal or 5mm, and I never have to pay a dime for .50 cal or 5mm ammo (or craft it, or farm materials for it). I typically trade in very large quantities - I get 30-100K 5mm / .50 cal ammo at a time from people whom I regularly supply with .45, 5.56, fusion cells, etc. That amount lasts me a month or more. When I farm steel, it's only used for crafing ultracite ammo. Also keep in mind, you earn about 3 caps per mutant on average, which is just pure profit, plus all the plastic scrap (10+ per laser rifle, which drop often), which also sells for 2-3c per to players (the pastic is actually 4-6x more valuable than the steel). 
---
When I look at activities in this game, I ask myself "what is the best use of my time? How can I leverage my game knowledge to make the most caps in the least amount of time?".
---
What platform are you on? Someone on Xbox has just posted on filthy casuals that they‚Äôve found them. 
---
Hopefully this helps üòÅ
---
At the expense of sounding defeatist, I'll say this:  The problem is not a lack of good and appropriate ideas.  The problem is the culture here.  There's a real insecurity among people, especially older WV residents.  Any time you try to show them a better way, you're met with *"You think you're better than us!"*  Their pride will not allow them to change.  Will not allow them to admit that maybe Donald Trump on a chariot made of coal isn't the answer to all of their problems.
---
I'm not sure what can be done other than letting the older generations die and hoping that their toxicity is lessened by the younger people having exposure to different schools of thought thanks to the Internet.
---
Same here.  Get the notification, fast travel to C.A.M.P., switch stuff around, grab aid, fast travel to event.  Oh look, 26 seconds left and everyone's on the roof except one dude in power armor trying to be all three conduits.  Lovely.
---
There is a post on here and another fo76 guide sub, that is a community generated list of known spawn locations for the tourists. There are like 18 known locations. My suggestion is to server hop wavy willards though. I went to almost every location and never found it.
---
Every night between 2-3 am
---
It looks cool on the atom store but I am going to wait until I see it in-game. I don't really like the X-01 suit tbh. I might just wait until the white PA skin comes out.
---
OMG that's a genius bit of design.  I thought it was just decorative.  No idea I could interact with it.
---
Kinda like how I accidentally stabbed one of my deathclaw eggs and goo went flying everywhere.
---
There are a few random encounters locations you can find them. 4% chance of getting the spawn you want each time, though. The best is just NWbof the hwy sign on 65, just S of the Crevasse dam, or there's a spawn point N/NE of munitions.
---
I think I may have an extra copy of that one?
---

I‚Äôve got a 1070 / ryzen 1600 / 16gb of ram... I run two clients simultaneously. Performance is pretty good :)
---
You XB1??? And thanks for the tip
---
That is very specific
---
Ah I see it now. Seems like it‚Äôs for Camps only. No workshops
---
Don't remeber where, but you can find a rusty key that unlocks that. Just a crate, and some random junk in there.
---
Yes!  Or any interior walls.
---
We‚Äôd be very lucky, but currently I think they‚Äôre working on how to implement it, whether or not as a Gas Mask or an armoured helmet but most likely the former and possibly as part of a quest in the Summer DLC, Nuclear Winter
---
This. He‚Äôs on a timer.
---
Go to Camden Park.  Loot the Nuka Cola cups with straws.  There's enough there to give you a nice little haul in plastic and cloth.  You'll also make a tidy profit looting the weapons off the scorched.
---
I was planning to get Play Time Paint but I just bought this War Raider Paint for they allowed it to use on every power armor type. Not great but it's a universal power skin.
---
Ah missed that one.  Too bad there isn‚Äôt a large consolidated request megathread.
---
Oh and I forgot, I regularly see 2 and 3 star lvl 68 super mutants at west tek and harpers ferry. Mining iron ore from hornwright testing site #3, you only get level \~30 enemies, rarely ever legendary, and you aren't killing them often. Even if a legendary drops, it will be low level and sub par. 
---
And you're earning exp while farming steel if you do west tek / harpers ferry.
---
No, I'm sorry, mining is garbage in this game. Lead is the only thing worth the time because the other methods don't get enough / have cooldowns (takes a while to respawn).
---
Pretty sure that was advertised for the next patch, May 7 I believe.
---
Just buy them off reddit. I would love to use my X01, never have, I just can't get my weight to a reasonable level, I have bought 3 off reddit for about 1k a leg, they out there, you just need to keep checking .. I think I am destined to just keep using Excavator .. that bug is annoying though, but isn't as bad as it used to be, after the 1500 max weight, the semi encumbered is ok, you just can't fast travel until you reset.
---
Not yet, it is coming. We all looking forward to it.
---
The new War paint is just what I wanted for my rp char, awesome!  
---
wondering if I can farm the required atoms on a brand new acc
---
ah i see what your saying, so is that possible under the bar set. i have not had time to see what is under each item set yet.
---
Yep, I'm on XB. 
---
I'd have to check if I still have it, I don't recall off hand.
---
*Angry Failsafe noises*
---
What are you playing on?
---
Where on the map is it?
---
I'm so sick of the ugly plaster interior. If BETH is going to sell clean objects and doors for the house, at least allow us to have clean, cute walls. They could make a killing.
---
It's a good point though, if I ever need that much water, I'll take all workshops and use my alt to hold them with a ton of purifiers. Do you know how often the "tick rate" happens?
---
They did mention this - it's jut not out yet.
---
Ok, let me be blunt.  It's a bad idea.  This would be very easy to abuse for greifng.  You find a camp with a bomb, grab a friend or two, and each one picks a wire color to cut.  Odds are one of you will get it wrong and blow up someone's camp.  
---
The only way to make it work would be to instance it to one person and having it only be the person whose camp is there so that they are the only one who can decide if it's worth the risk.
---
As it is this is a bad idea and wasn't thought out properly.  Added risk can be fun, but not if it can be abused to mess with other players.
---
Oxhorn isn't that great either...
---
Commenting so I can check if someone has a solution later. It's seriously infuriating, I feel your pain...
---
I would just watch the map and see where they end up!
---
Melee builds are already too op. No
---
Do you know what the ToS says?

---
There are tons of great ideas posted that slowly slip through the cracks. I think the mods can only sticky 2 topics at a time.  They should make a Bethesda request mega thread though!
---
Oh! I did something that helped me with blue screens. Lemme see if I can find it!
---
You on?
---
The easiest (albeit not 100%) proof is when you‚Äôre invisible from either Chamaeleon the mutation or armor perk... You stay invisible one jumping straight up and down
---
It's not really that high of a price these days.  Not too uncommon to see upwards of $20 for a skin.  Was a shift a while back to targeting whales and mtx prices went a little nutty in general.
---
Honestly I could throw the game out the window!
---
Will be in a moment
---
I used to farm for the trick-treat costumes/plans at Crevasse dam and got a lot. But a few patches ago they changed to be extremely ridiculously rare. I probably have one if ya need it. xb1
---
If the prices were cheaper people would just be using the free challenge items to buy stuff. The shop is designed to generate income.
---
Ya I don't like that either. I run T51 and really like the looks of the white one apparently coming next week. Guess I will wait on that one.
---
I can't wait to hear the reaction of my friends lol!
---
I want to dual wield pistols.  But oh well.
---
I am probably going to catch some crap for this comment, but these skins.. bone raider, black, and war rider.... have a WoW feel for the leveled armor sets.
---
I mean I can get the different paint schemes. Some are pretty cool.
---
But seriously, the way these power armor skins have changed the texture/aesthetic kinda making them feel like they are NOT power armor. 
---
This is just my opinion. Maybe I am just too old fashioned in my love for how PA looks as slightly rusted/dented, pure form from the original fallout games.
---
I am not trying to take away from anyone who enjoys them. I do commend the devs trying to do something different.
---
Found out the other day that if you don‚Äôt shoot her while she‚Äôs flying, she‚Äôll land more often. About 10 of us dropped her in a little over 7 minutes using that trick. Hope it helps!!
---
I still haven't gotten the terminal one to finish, hacked well over 50 terminals but nothing. It's keeping me from my precious plat trophy. :(
---
Ok I‚Äôll be on my phone so I might run into walls or something the controls are hard on a screen. Still pretty convenient though.
---
Shit people discipline their kids over an open mic, the stuff I‚Äôve heard on Call of Duty
---
Are you doing her solo or with a group?
---
I found one in the Phillipi battlefield cemetery. 
---
I suggest this area because Prickett's Fort and the Colonel Kelly monument are just a short walk away. Wavy Willard's isn't too far off either.
---
You'd swing each fist individually, there wouldn't be a damage increase. Maybe power attacks could do a bit more damage with you using both fists to attack, and maybe you could get slightly faster attack speed since you're using two, but yeah, straight doubling damage would be ridiculous.
---
And yeah I was thinking about that too. Gunslinger and Gladiator would definitley benefit from this.
---
Personally, I suggested this because I think it would look dope. Balance wasn't really in my mind.
---
More people to help. Can probably even post here to get people to join on you and help. One thing to keep in mind, she is a legendary, so once you get to 1/2 health she will regen back to full health before you can start taking her down again. 
---
Also I've read other posts indicating queen is scaled to first person into the event. So might be worth a shot to send in lowest level first. The post indicated higher lvls in first make her nearly invincible. Not sure how true this is, but worth a shot.
---
It's gonna be fun!
---
In In world now
---
It's not really my style, but I can see how people would like it.
---
The basic X-01 is probably my favorite, aesthetically.  The lines are smooth and clean, and it look the most like it provides actual deflective armor benefits, particularly with the large "blast cowl" surrounding the helmet.
---
The crustier and more shot-up I could make it look, the better.
---
I‚Äôd love to get it from you I won‚Äôt be online for a few hours hopefully be on in about 7 hrs since I‚Äôm at work
---
1H or 2H melee?  Team or Solo?
---
I'm running a 1H melee build, with sniper as secondary, and generally run solo, with power armor.
---
I dont remember all my perks, but heres what I do remember:
---
S 15: w/ Incisor3, packrat3, sturdy frame, martial art3 (swing speed), strong back, bandoleer, trav pharm.
---
P 13: lockpick, rifleman, greenthumb, tank killer, glowsight3 (for glowing ones)
---
E 9: ad. skel,, ghoulish, fireproof, good doggy, slow metabolism, rad resistance, ironclad
---
C3: Lone Wander2, Tenderizer1 (swap out hard bargain 3 and pop a grape mentat for trade)
---
I 11 : hacker, fix it good, weapon artisan, power user, first aid, armorer, gunsmith
---
A 4 : Thru hiker, white knight, actiongirl (max)
---
L 3: BloodyMes3 (swap out for super duper when crafting)
---
IIRC, gladiator is for 2H melee, not 1H
---
Good with salt is good early, as it reduces food spoilage, once you get good doggy and a supply of dog food, good with salt can go away.
---
Most charisma perks are for team play.
---
There may be a bug with the pylons but not sure; at an event today I tried activating them from the front like always and the command to activate didn't even pop up so I left and then someone in a PA suit came up to it and turned it on!   Are you not able to activate the same one twice in a row or within a certain time limit because I was able to activate the same ones minutes before.  This happened a few times, maybe other people are finding the same thing and just saying fook it?  There are some that just don't feel like being conduits either so there's still that.
---
Refer to my comment on u/shankwelle 's comment
---
\*suddenly tempted to make a new character, specializing specifically in the Ripper, and Shotguns\*  
---
THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!!!!!!
---
get a low tier vampire + swingspeed melee, melee vamp is bugged and simply swinging it restores your hp
---
I‚Äôm in world now
---
The Enclave vendor in Production pretty sure sells them full time, but I think its like 1200 w/o high Charisma / Hard Bargin.
---
How are you doing 10 runs in 30 minutes lol. If you're including server hopping, then half that time is basically waiting on loading screens.
---
Your Super Duper assumption is that it works 30% of the time. That's not accurate. If you smelt 10 times, your number would be 80 steel. Out of 10 smelts, I would get super duper on about half of them (if not more). Consistently. You initially gave the assumption that it's 30%, then here state it is entirely random. It can't be both.
---
You trade for ammo. Not everyone does. Some people play this game as lone wolf and don't want to deal with other players. 
---
.5c for steel? Sell me 200k steel then.
---
Also 3c per acid? Never paid more than 1c per.
---
Cool, I should still be around, msg me.
---
That's gotta chafe.
---
West Virginia didn‚Äôt exist in the War of 1812 :/
---
zoo wee mama
---
That one is no longer available
---
That would require the inverse to be true as well. So with Marsupial and its base of -4 INT...I'll pass on that
---
If you‚Äôre on PS4 you can do remote play
---
Anything any information will help x
---
It's not true anymore.  She used to scale based on players present at the start.
---
You would think so
---
Looks more like a strategy meeting
---
Thankful for the new emote!
---
Unless it only effects the building of the player who activated it.
---
If you had to press R or L to swing each one individually, it could open up some cool, interesting options.  An anti-armor or vampiric left hand for general use, then the instigating or furious one punch KO on the right hand.  Very Tyson-esque and thematic.  
---
I see you bruh, and I appreciate your thoughts.
---
We know, been out since last Thursday I believe
---
Junkies does very good damage if Max‚Äôd out. But the maintenance costs are horrendous- you lose addictions if you die. So getting re-addicted to 5-6 different chems every time you die is like 25-30 chems per death
---
I did this as well while I was doing the main quest / side quests. Saves a ton of caps while you're new.
---
You get XP from smelting too.
---
You can't say mining is garbage, then say lead is worth it. That's just contradictory.
---
I have also Had my Share of Crashes in PS4. Defragging it helped me out a lot:
---
Put your console on safe mode and then do option 5 and it defrags it making it smoother
---
I think they will eventually come out with some. The blood streaked metal one from about a month ago looked pretty cool.  
---
I would like to see more faction related items in the atom shop for sure!  A data miner had a neat looking PA skin for the fire breathers up a few weeks back.
---
More guns skins and armor stuff would sell like hotcakes!
---
I love you don't know what you are drinking. I'm keeping my punch bowl full of Nuka Shine. Bye camp visitors!
---
No, no there isn't.
---
I saw it only on Fred's BBQ, so thought this one new :(
---
Seems like we have opposite problems! I just threw out like 12 fusion cores because my stash was full...
---
Ever have a legendary item get displayed long after you've found it? Or get rewards for an event long after you completed it?
---
The game acts normal. Seems to be functioning. But some of the background mechanics are heavily delayed. I call it stealth lag.
---
This is wrong. Dude gave me one. I scrapped it and learned it. Now I craft an extra to carry around with me and give it to people I meet sometimes if they are cool or just ask me.
---
It's a good idea, but it's up to Bethesda.  I bet an open, free weekend might stress the servers again like when the beta was originally going on.  But I would love to see new players go at it again, and bring in potentially new long-term members of the 76 community.
---
FYI, I had to bid 5K to win the bidding war last night
---
Hell yeah man. I just hope it actually gets added eventually lol
---
Got an in game pic?
---
I don't understand why this is a thing. We could already take pictures for free. Why would we want a camera that takes up space and requires film?!
---
[](/celestiawat)You can only carry 25k per character, so we're going to need: 1,600 characters each just to make that transaction. You can only have 5 per account, so at current market values we're going to need to buy $19k in fallout 76 copies each as well.  
---
I don't think it's worth it honestly.
---
Nope. It also spawns at near groves family cabin in the northwest corner of the map.
---
Uhm I rock full unyielding/sentinel/ap regen on my unarmed melee and ass/sent on my bloodied sniper survival char and power armor is inferior in every single way üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

How to rebuild your database
---
Power off¬†your PlayStation 4 and do not use rest mode.
---
Hold¬†the power button down until you hear two quick beeps. This will alert you that you have entered Safe Mode.
---
Connect¬†your DualShock 4 controller to your USB-A slot in the front of the PlayStation 4.
---
Scroll down in the menu until you reach option 5,¬†Rebuild Database.
---
Press the¬†X button¬†to start the rebuild.

If you post here 30 minutes before launch, you will have a full server with lots of help.
---
If you can cripple her wings she lands and the melee guys can hit her. I have a nice lever that does added limb damage and it seems to work well. Someone with a heavy automatic gun with crippling can really bring her down fast.
---
Step 1: Fast travel to any water source on the map
---
Step 2: Spam the collect water button 3,000 times
---
Step 3: Success!
---
Step 4: Drop 250 Dirty Waters in a doggie bag by the shore
---
Okay thanks
---
It has improved my gameplay soooo much, and the performance of my PS4.
---
Same.  I expect to buy a few things today, like the track suit and football outfit.  I have no interest in Power Armor skins.
---
farm legendaries/plans i guess?  
---
There's new content getting released over the next few weeks and beyond.  I just made my first decontamination shower, and felt like I was done with the game...but re-exploring Cranberry Bog drew me right back in.
---
I'll launch a nuke tonight and we can all BBQ the SBQ.  I'll post here before i run the silo.  IGN Spankypants, on PC.
---
Nice!  Is your camp in a well traveled location?  Just wait till player vending! Lol
---
I always forget this is in Fallout 76, and I'm like: A dead tourist? WTF?!
---
im talking about before all this microtransaction garbage got shoved into video games. they never had issues paying for servers then, did they???
---
Best build are for best people :D good job on math man!
---
ah yes so youd rather spend 5 to 10 bucks on EVERY small update to play it instead? cause thats how games have been working.
---
That attitude is just a feature, not sure it can ever be changed. Someone once told me we can‚Äôt get rid of our demons, only re-educate. 
---
The problem is: you can‚Äôt just leave people behind. That never, ever ends well for anyone. If you can show them change is in their best interest it may be different.
---
Was not aware of this, thanks for giving us all a heads up on this one! 
---
Hopefully Bethesda will patch this ASAP.
---
It has the t-60 legs on it because i can't find the x-01 shocks.
---

---
Each purifier (up to the ‚Äúwater‚Äù rating of the workshop) gets +1 water up to its cap every 5 minutes, so if you check every small purifier every 10 minutes, that‚Äôs 100% efficient.  Realistically, I had a repeating 9 minute timer that would signal time to do a run, which in itself could take 3-4 minutes depending on loading time between workshops. Then I‚Äôd go back to reading comics or whatever until the next alarm.  
---
Berkeley Mine and power plants were my favorites, because I could also be the FC fairy, handing out packs of 10 FCs to everyone I saw.
---
Yes I am the same way!!
---
Alright thanks.
---
games used to add free updates all the time. how has everyone seemed to forget back when games like L4D2 had free DLC? how have you been brain washed into being nickle and dimed over every tiny little drip of content??
---
Thanks much.  Doesn‚Äôt look like the promotional pics......
---
Doesn't help also that the event is activated by someone entering the map cell. So you know majority of the time they're going to be completing the event and It'll be gone before you even notice it's been activated on the map.
---
I want to be able to equip Mole Miner Gauntlets while wearing power armor.  Have you seen the size of those things? Seems like they'd fit just fine...
---
Shoot the rest of the cows, then give him a thumbs up for the win.
---
happy cake day!
---
Never knew this. This could be fun.
---
I like the vintage nukashine idea!
---
it really doesn't. :/
---
It doesn't display the 100% chance in Vats, but it does always hit, just like a Crit, with a damage bonus.
---
Stalker's is not a particularly useful perk on Shotguns, is however great on Sniper Rifles, I Used a Stalker's, Explosive, with 15% faster Vats Crits for a while.
---
nah I care but I know random shit sometimes comes from my side too so it would just be hypocritical for me to complain about it
---
If only it was like that in  real life. Always have line cutter's here.
---
How long does this take?? X
---
Ok, i couldn't wait for confimation of them looks of it so went and bought it.. Here's a pic of it in X-01 (on medium setting) Looks as advertised. 
---

This post gave me an idea for a "wall-eyed" perk for dual wielding pistols, where you can maintain accuracy and fire rate while holding two pistols at once.  If you don't know what the term "wall-eyed" means, look up images of the actor Marty Feldman. My original post with links was deleted because of blacklisted sites. so I guess you have to do some work if you want to get the idea.
---
Really?! I made a post the other day and they said it would cost about 1.5-2K to get the plans. That's crazy.
---
I‚Äôd settle for just one in Power Armor.  My Legendary Ghoul Slaying Power Fist that I can take into a nuked Whitesprings.
---
My camp is secluded. But that'll make it all the more memorable for players who stumble across my camp lol :)
---
I thought it was a nice touch ;)
---
The current endgame is whatever you want it to be. After killing the SBQ and imposter sheepsquatch for the hundredth time, there really isn‚Äôt anything else, other than role playing as whatever suits your play style. Find new people to make friends with, raid camps, trade, be a wandering merchant, or even a Mothman priest, or like me just have fun doing all the above.
---
I mean, if they really wanted to balance a duel wield power fist they could have both aim + fire do an assaultron power attack which works just like how it does, puts you into a locked position attack and drains half your action points but does increased damage if you actually manage to land such a hit.
---
This realistically just makes the cosmetic items from the event more valuable due to the difficulty this event is for some players. I don't mind it honestly. There's got to be some valuable items in the game other than legendaries.
---
I‚Äôve done that hitting space instead of VATS and I was like. Umm, ok
---
Unless you had actual proof it wouldn't have gone anywhere.
---
"911? Yes hello, somebody in Fallout76 was beating their dog. No sir it was a real dog not one in the game. Sir what, no I don't have any video or audio evidence that they were doing it, I just heard it. Hello, sir are you there?"
---
Unless Bethesda is storing our voice chat, there's no proof for them to do anything about it other than banning the guy because one other guy said something
---
I like the body of it, but the head is horrible on X-01.
---
I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm still WEARING it.
---
But I'll probably go back to Blackbird shortly - THAT was the nicest one they released imo.
---
Yeah that is what I was thinking as well. But I really hope they add more dungeons or even raids so that farming is a bit more entertaining. Doing same dailies all the time gets boring very fast. Thanks for answer and congrats on your decontamination shower.
---
It is bad ass looking.
---
General Specific - he'll do the defcon updates for the Enclave.
---
I think it only took a few mins for me? I did it a couple months ago. It was scary but it ended up being just fine. Since then I've added an external harddrive to help with patch updates.
---
Im camped by overseers camp, maybe im just lucky
---
They need Marine paint ASAP.
---
I think I ran into the same guy last night huge dbag bitching at everyone that they were getting in the way of his shots.  So I went off on him not one of my finer moments but I couldn't stand to hear him chirping away like some moron.
---
I inception this.
---
It's really hard to figure out. I know that the map that they originally showed in the trailer was changed when you look at the one that's up in the office. I've been back-and-forth multiple times and I've checked all over those areas and that's where I found the plans for the wendigo and the mystery meat pie but as far as I know nothing also shown up in the other ones
---
Yeah I really think you and I are not on the same page fore sure.....  console doesn‚Äôt have access keys.  The ‚Äúaccess key‚Äù in our world is the disc....  thus why there are pre owned copies of fo76 for Xbox and PS4. There is no breaking of the tos at all. I don‚Äôt understand why you posted them.
---
I do a lot of events with a group, sometimes so many of us we need 3 teams, and after the Event is complete, we all gather and drop what we don't Want, Need or Use, to share with each other, it's the very nature of what most avid Fallout players always wanted, "Cooperative Gameplay".
---
Remember to wear excavator armor so you get 4x the ore, and if you run out of acid, server hop at Toxic Larry's and kill snallygasters for acid. You'll occasionally get a legendary one there too.
---
It‚Äôs not that low. Used is like $15-25

It is 30% chance to double your craft. That comes out to 30% more on average. It's a percent chance, which means it's somewhat random how much it procs. You know how randomization works, yes? Sometimes you might get 10 procs in a row. Other times you might not get any procs for 20 crafts. This is the nature of % based randomization. On average, however, it will come out to 30%.
---
I don't have 200K steel on hand, nor do I have room for 100K caps across my 2 accounts. The steel I farm I use for crafting ultracite ammo. 
---
Are you on console? Because prices can vary a lot on console. On PC, Acid is 3c per (go check the PC section of the  discord of the t-r-a-d-e subreddit that we can't link or speak of in this reddit), but I've seen people buying it as high as 7c per. It's by far one of the most difficult things to farm, and it's used a lot.
---
They need to "holy grail" it.
---
Free weekend + double XP + major event.
---
Any of them on their own are not enough.
---
Uhh......?
---
Yep, happened to be bidding against 3 others.  Supply &amp; demand at work.  Hope you have better luck.
---
Wavy Willard's entrance, there is a car he's leaning against. Can't miss him, when there of course.
---
And strap a mod to the combat knives where the hounds shoot bees.
---
I didn't realize it was my cake day lmao. thanks!
---
Hopping onto the top comment to say this.  This reminds me of back when Diablo 3 did the double legendary drop rate weekend, and then decided to leave the doubled rates in due to the influx of players/player retention.
---
Bethesda take note, the double XP made a bunch of people return, others play longer, etc.  People like to see progress happen in a game like this, be it leveling, loot or whatever.  If the grind is too high people stop playing.  Things that ease the grind increase player retention.
---
nobody will ever buy this coal skin if raider was available in the shop
---
Would actually be very nice if you could join factions and then based on that do PvP or faction quests of some sort. Or if they let us make guilds so that you can RP with people, make your own factions.
---
Yes, this would be so helpful. I don‚Äôt intend to loot someone else‚Äôs junk during Encryptid but it‚Äôs happened by accident!
---
I‚Äôd bet the reason they haven‚Äôt is because a lot of people prefer to show off their costumes, instead of their armor. As a heavy gunner, I like PA skins lol. 
---
But seriously, I agree they should come out with more standard armor skins. If there were more, and better, ones, I‚Äôm sure people would show it off more often.
---
I believe the vaults are going to be raid-like dungeons
---
That's a nice offer but I'm on PS4 my dude. Thanks anyways.
---
FYI A tesla rifle's full mag deals 3x more total damage than a single mini nuke
---
I really hope so.
---
Sorry i took so long replying
---
That's a shame about air control, I hoped they'd be immobile till they land and when in power armour (so they'd survive) the delay when landing in PA would give enough time for it to trigger or be manually triggered, oh well I may still try it if not as a surprise then as a fun ride
---
You can also use VATS to shoot thru walls and obstacles you normally could not, depending on your camera angles.
---
Ever since a change a couple (maybe more now) patches ago.  VATS used to initially target low, and then climb to the right % value.  I think there was a patch note about how if you shot during this moment, it would make VATS stick to that low value and bug out.
---
But since then, when you target with VATS it starts very high, and then stabilizes to the true value.  This works on 0% shots due to obstacles too.  So for a moment on first targetting, it will be a near 95% chance (sometimes high 70-80) to hit even though it's really 0%.  You can pull the trigger at this time to get that high chance.  Works well on PVE.
---
Those stack together pretty nicely. Looks great!
---
I have no evidence for this, but I expect it to arrive in Patch 9 next week.
---
I didn't think Tesla rifle did area damage though?
---
Guess I'll keep trying. Been server hopping Wavy Willards for about an hour every day..
---
I just ran into "calibrated shocks" mod at Watoga yesterday.  What suit they go on....no idea.  I was tempted to buy them to resell for player vending, but since I had no idea what series of suit they worked with, and nor could my future customers, I passed.  T-51b would be rad, but 45 and 60 aren't so cool.
---
Worst power armor imo
---
This is the only one I have been able to spawn. I cant get the one at the BBQ place.
---
Thank you, good info to have.
---
Sorry bud I lack both the setup to make vids and people to help with my plan
---
My most enjoyable character is a gunslinger. To be viable against tough monsters, you need to use vats criticals. I have a two shot pipe pistol, and I swap to a zealots crit dmg 44 for scorchbeast headshot crits. You will never get per shot damage of rifles, but you need to not be afraid to shoot nonstop. Keep your adrenaline stacks up, gunfu the easy mobs first, then let that critical rip.
---
What you see in the picture is what you get, no matter which armor you put it on. In this case, I didn't really mind because it looks very distinctive. 
---
I didn't like it with the previous skin because it turns  all armors into X01 with a sticky green color and some blotches.
---
Ah! Thank you. Must be getting the patch notes mixed up with the Road Map :)
---
I am wondering why all the power armor paints are black and dark. I mean they only need to release one black skin lol.
---
I‚Äôm going to give benefit of the doubt and guess that it wasn‚Äôt going to be free at first, and just like some other things as of late, someone in QA missed it when it was added to the bundle.
---
This is something I miss about The Tomorrow Children. Players interactions were so calm. Standing in line at a shop, sitting on a bench waiting for the bus, loading materials for someone else so they don't have to stop what they are doing and come down the cliff....
---
R.I.P
---
may 9th when new patch hits.
---
Thank you very much! I appreciate it. Damn shame, of course, but good to know. Must've gotten the Road Map mixed up with the Patch notes &gt;.&lt;
---
I think I remember when Microsoft announced they were going to go with a similar setup as pc, disc locked to the console so you couldn‚Äôt just loan the disc out.  I don‚Äôt remember that going well that E3.
---
Indeed it was still part of Virginia, however, several people from places that became W. Va served in the war of 1812.
---
I hoard all ammo types besides energy type ones. Never been energy weapons type guy. It's good to go melee for a while to to get stocked up on ammo to, then again I like the melee build.
---
I am totally with you.  You shrug, move on, maybe server hop again.   It's not like it's his real life brahmin lol.  I think sometimes people need to take a step back,  shake their head, and move on.  If you're on xbox one we have a  pretty chill group if you want to do the event or just play around!
---
Thank you.  Once the atom shop text is clarified I‚Äôll definitely pick this bundle up.
---
Theres 3 ive found so far
---
Apparently it just grows on trees!
---
This is by far my favorite glitch. Who needs nukashine
---
Hopefully, definitely looking forward to it.
---
I shouldn‚Äôt need to get on my phone and visit several game wikis each time I buy mods to figure out what they do and which armor they go on.
---
I understand that hence why I didn't say "don't make things limited time only" I said that not every single nice looking skin they bring out needs to be limited time they should keep a couple of the nice ones in the game forever
---
seems like you already have it all figured out.  You know what you don't want to do...now just do the opposite.
---
always switch the production over to .38 before you leave, always
---
That would work also.  The point is that as it's laid out it's a bad idea.  If you can find a way to use the idea for griefing in under 60 seconds then it shouldn't be done.  Personally I would make it so that it can't spawn if it would effect a camp area at all.  That eliminates the issue while letting everyone see it and try their luck.  There are ways to make it work, we just came up with 3 of them.
---
I want you to do this as well.   Then I want you to be forever known as Fisto, hero of Appalachia.   You're not the hero we deserve  but the one we....wait....um hey what are you...oh god... OH GOD...AAAAAAARRRGGGHHH
---
Anyone have a link that isn't bethesda.net? Link won't work at work.
---
Awesome. As a recent newbie to the game now I know why people were hanging around randomly shooting the floor when I was restocking. My wife and I just thought it was a threat and ran! :S
---
The online multiplayer is slowly growing on me!!
---
I had this happen to me over a month ago, I don't believe it's related to the camera. I vaguely remember reading a post regarding this, but didn't pay much attention to the cause. I'm fortunate enough that the PS4 saves a hard copy externally. I don't get to see my old photos in loading screens, granted. Glad I can still access them, though!
---
They do? Thank for the tip how long is the lag and how often do they trigger?
---
Most likely he pulled agro on a robot shooting you this happened to me once when i was in the bunker i didnt engage him back but the bots still killed me
---
Lol, this could be truer than you realize. I think it's just how poorly they have implemented the perk cards.
---
Have you tried it?   If that works I may have to join the 21st century.
---
I think cap loss in Adventure should be what it currently is in Survival......minimal.  
---
Survival cap loss should be this:
---
Double cap loss per level, maxing at level 76. This is a fair compromise imo. Lower level guys don't get totally screwed and higher levels don't get totally screwed.
---
Level 5 dies-loses 10 caps
---
Level 30 dies-loses 60 caps
---
Level 76 dies-Loses 152 caps
---
Level 500 dies-Loses 152 caps.
---
Once you hit level 65/70 you should have decent gear and a build mostly figured out. I'm about level 170 and really have no advantage over a level 70 guy.  I actively avoided the survival mode because I was losing 300 plus caps every time I died in pvp. It just got too expensive to play.
---
Let me put it another way. Mining and smelting is like working at McDonalds for minimum wage. Farming steel from mutants is like working a cushy office job making 6 figures. Now yes, you can make money working at McDonalds (mining), but it's easily 5-6x more efficient to work the office job (mutant farming), and the office job has lots of other fringe benefits, like annual bonuses and more vacation time (legendary items).
---
Now look, the world needs McDonalds workers just as much as it needs cushy office workers, so if that's your calling, then more power to you. I'm just letting you know that you have the option to work the nice office job.
---
It‚Äôs like waiting at the bank, or at your favorite local restaurant.
---
I have to resist the urge to pick up duct tape in DIY stores.
---
If its one kid getting salty that pisses you off wait until you hear about the mods over at /r/market76
---
Are you on pc?
---
Yeah, really all there is explore, farm legendary, Grind for better gear. I like that stuff though. Fingers crossed more content coming soon.
---
They go on sale later this week.
---
I hope soon, some dickhead destroyed mine and when i messages about why he just acted like he knew nothing even tho i saw him with his explosive weapons
---
Username checks out
---
I just had a manifestation of Fozzy Bear appear before me.  WOKKA WOKKA WOKKA LOL
---
I'm gonna fill mine with high radiation fluid and then sell access to my rad station.  And high priced radaway in my vending machine!
---
...one can wish anyway...
---
The high level one is way over on the right side in the mire.  Next to the Southern Belle Motel, which is right by a curve in the road.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6zK9b9qMb0kWcnBxUNJOlB/atomic-shop-patch-8-items-and-sales
---
Loool dupers.
---
Maybe as a workaround add something into the drop pool for assaultrons that you can craft into the cards? Like with the assaultron heads and circuit boards? Maybe assaultron chips and you need a bunch of them plus plastic
---
If only it was usable on something other than excavator.
---
once you add one nice thing you have to make future skins as good as this or even better to make people buy them, which means more resources to make skin, which means higher prices and a lot more problems with community
---
The level of a weapon doesn't effect that ratio so just make the lowest ones
---
Also makes me think how much build templates would help.
---
If you misplace the space, it becomes **boner aider**. AKA Viagra.
---
9th or 7th?
---
In the meantime you can attach the flat roof section to the foundation and go from there ;) it's how I've always got around it
---
Thats evil hahaha
---
I have mine sitting across the table from me...so I have company during dinner üòÅ
---
Free weekend with full junk ammo items and level 25/50 with unlimited stash. Can‚Äôt trade/drop/buy anything but it gives everyone including the player base currently the ability to try new builds out for a weekend if they do choose. 
---
I for one would love the chance to go out there with a nuclear slingshot and all the heavy gunner perks across the board and try out if I wanted to build that character or not. Shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult to either setup some servers separate or just make it so we can‚Äôt drop anything. 
---
Plus it would probably give the new player base a better ‚Äúfeel‚Äù to the game so they don‚Äôt have to go through the initial grind to gather the good feeling after they reach the higher levels through grinding while convincing them to do so after that character is deleted.
---
Cool idea, but the balancing would require effort and mathematical skill, so it wi probably never happen.
---
One of those things that should have been were the game given proper development at the start.
---
Ah excellent. Thanks for the link again. I skimmed it earlier, assumed everything was on sale from April 30. Clever that they‚Äôre doing one day sales of things - making me log in every day to get the things I want.
---
Sounds like someone with anger issues.
---
I like your business road map you have in place.
---
It also should be noted that when you build the punch bowl it takes up the available 1/1 "slot" for the beer keg and punch bowl. 
---
I assume this means the beer keg when released will serve the same function just with a different aesthetic as you stated.
---
Seems like it does! Even funnier is that OP‚Äôs other posts and comments in this sub are just about how dupers didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and it‚Äôs all Bethesda‚Äôs fault, but he swears he didn‚Äôt dupe! He just found 220k ultracite rounds!
---
So ive just tried it but the cable I put into the ps4 to the remote doesnt let me open up any options or even acknowledge that's I'm pressing the ps button!!
---
I've tried it with 2 other cables and 2 other remotes :(
---
Damn and I just got the Plague Rider too. Oh well, good bye saved up atoms lol.
---
I suggest level 1 of each Heavy Weapons perk, and make sure you have AmmoSmith &amp; Super Duper ranked up, cause they eat a lot of ammo.
---
That ToS applies to all Zenimax games.
---
Just because you can use the same disc doesn't mean its intended to work this way.
---
I am pretty certain that Bethesda is not down with the idea of people buying one disc and using it for many different accounts.

But that's just me, your friendly neighborhood zombie medic.
---
Punch bowl?! Hello cult leadership position!
---
I‚Äôm really torn. I really want this armor, as well as the Death Rider, but supporting microtransactions (especially when they‚Äôre so expensive) feels wrong to me. 
---
I‚Äôm kind of interested in seeing how War Rider mixes with the blackbird paint scheme, though.
---
This guy does it all the time. It‚Äôs like a sick joke! You finally find this impossible vendor, he more than likely doesn‚Äôt have the items your looking for, and then he drops dead in 2 minutes!!! It happens to me every time I find him... which has been a total of 3 and I try every day lol
---
You‚Äôre still missing something here. Think back to my explanation with goldeneye 007 for n64....
---
I thought you had a question about the movie lol
---
This was the reason i said on IG that human quest giving NPCs might not work, i can see someone getting the quest and then killing the npc to be a jerk.
---
Yup.  Nuka Cola Dark can be given as a quest reward
---
I've also found the non-event "protect the brahmin from the sheepsquatch "  spawn in the cranberry glade location(or whatever its called).
---
You know? I was *just* thinking that. There's that trick, and I could always just use a single foundation a little further down my hill, a set of stairs, and just build everything branching off of that solitary staircase.
---
It quite literally melts .308 ammo so i think i'll go with my trusty Enclave Gatling, 150 damage per hit and 300 ammo capacity. I deal the most damage to SBQ usually.
---
Yeah, Fort McCormick has been my goto as of late but it's pretty slim pickins. Most fruitful run was like... 6 ammo bags and military grade duct tape I think. 
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Slugger/Master/Expert stack additively. They space them out so that you don't get too close to peak damage by level 10. 
---
I don't really see the problem. The perk distribution is ugly for pistol builds (too much relevant stuff in Agility), but otherwise builds are straightforward to construct. Situational perk-swapping is mildly annoying (especially for lockpick &amp; super duper), and I can understand complaints there, but it does give you some progression after level 50.
---
And if fast traveling to an event could put you \*at\* the event and not where it started, that would also be great.  Nothing like traveling to one, having to sprint full out to catch up to it and getting there in time to have it end without doing any damage.
---
ok.  any others?  or is that the only one you have seen?
---
Yep, I'm entirely OK with them making skins as expensive as they want. Skins have absolutely zero impact on gameplay. This is the best way they can monetize this game besides adding a subscription. More of this, less of the repair kit type stuff.
---
Nice, thanks for the tips! I was skeptical about how Fallout would work in the wonder world of online jackassery and have been pleasantly surprised at how helpful people are.
---
Heck even think of it as a dvd..... you buy one. You put it in the living room DVD player and watch it.  Then you put it in the kids room DVD player the next day because they want to watch it.
---
That‚Äôs a pretty common Bethesda aesthetic. (See Skyrim). Probably not
---
this would look awesome in oil on a canvass
---
That's the same thing I did, bon voyage pesky visitors!
---
Honestly, if your goal is purely resources go to the forest locations, everything there is one shot easy, and they drop more or less the exact same loot with even less risk or effort. 
---
I run around with a tesla rifle and don't even have to aim at things, the arcs kill them all.
---
I have experienced this too on the 1X. I generally have it smooth out after waiting until everything is loading or after fast traveling once.
---
PLZ, plz include a Robot Armor paint; robot armor gets zero love, same with Marine.
---
Get a paper clip and try resetting the controller with the little pinhole button behind the L buttons.
---
It's surprisingly replayable with a new character, although you might want to take a break in between.
---
never played it.  thanx any ways.
---
Not according to this

---
Yeah they were wanted, so my mutation hit em and they got a lucky kill. Was too bad cause I actually caught them and my game crashed right when I VATS targeted them with my bloodied Gauss. Lesson learned, dont AFK on Fallout 76 while on a cell phone hotspot connection.. :X
---
Kinda - the bowl has just 10 Slots. Choose wisely and refill often :P
---
... not sure how I had not considered that, good idea.
---
Exactly this. I've saved up for that and this one. I also have blackbird and Graham skins. I've never spent a dime and don't intend to. Power armor skins are exactly the kind of thing bethesda should be selling to make money on this game for the long run.
---
Haha, yea sorry wrote in wrong subreddit.
---
Question: how do you tell the pylon's numbers? The game says 1 of the 3 pylons has no conduit, but all 3 pylons look the same to me.
---
Yeah, it's not the worst build system ever. It at the least needs a good tweaking. Maybe part of it is seeing perks left out of my build that is for my build but not having the points to put in to get them in there. Again I think build templates would help with the situational swaps and be less annoying.
---
I assume that was for one X-01 shock rather than two?
---
5k doesn't surprise me. They're such a pain to find that if they cost much less then they're probably duped.
---
This LITERALLY has nothing to do with what we are talking about. This is for beta codes
---
You JUST made me realize that my damn turrets must‚Äôve shot up my corn...
---
I haven't made my way into the bog yet... just barely made it into the Mire. I restarted my toon when a buddy started playing so we could grind together.

Thanks for the tips.

I go where the shine takes me.

Junk nodes are about the only thing I can think of.  Sometimes you can't always reliably find the specific junk you need.   
---
Also, not everyone really actually likes server hopping.  So there's that too.  I get it, its "more efficient" when you're farming to clear an area that has what you need then hop and do it again.  Still dont like it.  
---
Umm...the Processed food at that one farm isn't really all that bad.  Purified water and Fresh Salsbury steak (no rads, 20% food) make for happy survivors.  
---
Aside from that...yea...There are better ways to get basically anything in the game...with those few exceptions.
---
I want to dual wield vintage Nukashine...
---
Is it just for real players? Or is it protection from enemies too?
---
What is the back story to these 4  rider skins? Is there something I can read up on this?
---
Seriously thought the descriptions were glitches out for me but they‚Äôre not even in the game at all? Bethesda has to be made aware of this? Jeez
---
I have seen it randomly in the world, but I have no idea when anymore.
---
Great minds think alike ;)
---
Ah thank you for the updated picture!! I can't wait to get home and buy this! It looks stunning\~
---
Yea would be interesting to try new builds, maybe see some stuff I missed. But wouldn't really be able to do it so soon.
---
Pretty sure it's the only one because the others are not alcohol
---
It ain't much better on PC.
---
Put cheapskates in debt until they pay it back (max = level), and have them on the map with their debt visible.
---
True enough, but they also drop low level legendaries then. Some of those might be useful, but if I get a BE or B25 .50 cal, I want it to be max level =). There is no risk in farming for me, and spending 1 extra bullet to kill a max level mutant vs. killing a low level one is pretty trivial, when you consider the benefit of possibly getting high level legendaries. Plus, West Tek and Harpers ferry are used not because of their level range, but because of the density of mutants that spawn, which is much higher than anywhere in the forest.
---
There‚Äôs some good people in this ol apocalyptic wasteland :)
---
Yes that's what my post says I play on mute. good talk. Be sure to downvote the post because all tv's have mute buttons right?
---
But then what if it doesnt connect again at all after :(
---
Cool thank you
---
Do you own workshops, they allow exploit type one sided assassinations of the people who own them for an insignificant fee
---
It depends imo. If you like to use any two shot weapons then I would say yes gunsmith, but most of the time you can just get away with using weapon artisan
---
That might be going a bit far with it....But I would rather have seen (rather than being able to build extractors on nodes) more of the prebuilt Resource things that need powering (fusion cores, packaged food, ammo, steel)...and THOSE can produce bulk items.  Hemlock Holes could have had acid, Wade airport for oil.  Grafton of course for steel...You could even have a special resource extractor in the charleston junkyard that produced scrap items a lot faster than normal from the same random table it already has.  
---
Things that exist, cannot be moved, and need to be powered/repaired, but not things that can be player built and that make each workshop unique.
---
I think the limited availability is a crucial, key component from a commercial standpoint.  It relies upon the boutique model of the fashion industry to drive sales as high as possible in a short window, with the idea that the consumer is terrified of missing their opportunity, and becomes willing to invest beyond their means to be "in".  
---
The entire "sneaker head" industry would not exist without this business model.  The fashion industry has been doing this for decades.  If "limited edition" is watered down by being made in millions of units or sold for a full season, you get the same phenomenon of the comic book and toy collecting explosion of the 1990's. Everything is worthless and ceases to have a feeling of exclusivity and individuality.
---
Of course I share the sentiment that the Atomic Shop's design team's best work is "wasted" on ephemeral pieces that come and go for only a week, but that's what makes some of the paints so special.  When you see a guy in X-01 Blackbird paint, you know they're an OG and probably know their shit.  In a sense, that's what you're paying for....the exclusivity, the VIP status.  If it's available to everyone and any time, like the Nuka Cola paints, it's just kinda meh.  You saw another Ford Mustang drive by.  Cool car, but whatever.  When the guy with Blackbird paint shows up at the Whitespring, it's like seeing an original '67 Shelby GT500.  Everyone turns their heads.
---
Drink the Nukashine and journey.
---
If they have a crafting station, bed, chair, or instrument near a window, you can get in by pressing the action button.
---
they are in the files, but i have yet to find any and the paddleball cant be scrapped to learn any.
---
if someone has found some id also appreciate a location or info on them
---
I just use them when crafting. They use too many valuable slots for my build.
---
Ah alright thanks now I know how stalkers works
---
Dual wielding gatling lasers would be sweet.
---
I use the satellite dish outside of West Tek. indestructible floor up top. Leave a hole in a floor you build above it so they drop down in then they get wrecked by 3 turrets and radiation emitters/tesla traps
---

  War Rider X-01 for anyone interested.
---
Get her hooked on the game as well? Worked for me. :)
---
If they were released on 50% the first day then raised to 1400 again I would be fine with it. Just the fact that its 1400 no matter what no sale no discount annoys me.
---
I use the makeshift warrior whenever I'm fighting - repair maybe once a week and I'm on every day?
---
sheet dmg can be a little misleading I have a lvl 50 all rise and it sits in my stash.  I run a full chameleon build with ninja max and sneak max.  I use a swing speed furious combat knife that has stealth added to the blade so I one shot most monsters and get over 2 attacks a second.  This weapon super fast super deadly and needs to be repair bout 1 a week.  as for a 2 handed weapon I way prefer an instigating swing speed bat to the allrise.  And for sheer dmg on a one hand the new burning barbed sheepsquatch club is a beast for me its start dmg is over 350 and its one hand at medium speed.
---
Would be nice to have the option to name tag your camp as well
---
I use a Primed Zealot's, Explosive, Faster Reload LMG on the Mobs &amp; Regular SBs, and a Primed TSE 50 Cal on the SBQ, both require a lot of resource farming to keep properly fed.
---
Don't hang out with the cheaters in game, they probably do the same thing even in real life.
---
Lol, went to the lighthouse and there she was. Thanks :)
---
For ranged weapons they seem to help significantly,  as for melee I don't know as I only use a Grognak's ax and it's buggy atm.
---
Don't quote me on the source, but I heard a rumour that a Bethesda employee implied the keg was a reward for a weekly alcohol challenge.
---
What did it cost you?
---
Also a reminder don't zoom in then emote unless you want to fast travel for free most likely a mile in the air
---
Well it will have to eventually. Are any of the controllers on right now? One might be connected wirelessly, preventing another controller to connect.
---
This is not what I‚Äôm talking about. I‚Äôm talking about someone repeatedly loading in and out of the game, walking under my camp floor and vats‚Äôing me through the floor before the floor loads in for him.
---
Just players
---
What id like to see is that we can favorite 5 events (via the Pip-Boy) once we have completed the event, and when any of those 5 go active on the map, we‚Äôd get a notification.
---
AND MY AXE!!!! or wait....
---
No, not as far as I know there is no key you have to enter to play on consoles. I am not sure but I think even if you buy it digitally on your console you can play it on different psn/xbox accounts as long as the software is on your console and you link your account to your bethesda account.

I would break my promise to not by atoms if it meant I could get raider themed armor and clothing

Scorch beast queen farm events for more gear and doing the shit for atoms

---
If I've already picked up a camera can I find another broken one for a friend?
---
I understand the marketing behind but still they make enough money they can bare to make the loss on a couple skins if it means we can have some nice pieces of armour without needing to spend thirty dollars on them because of limited time.
---
Not everybody cares if they look cool because they have a limited edition skin, some people just want a nice skin.
---
i personally do want limited time because it creates a variety of different skins instead of everyone having the best looking skin but they don't need to make every single skin, that is not a paint, limited time, they can bare to permanently put a cool skin in the atom shop.
---
Lol I‚Äôve tried! She can‚Äôt seem to get the hang of the movement of the joysticks. She stays at  home while I‚Äôm at work so I always tell her she could level up like crazy!

Springs were a real struggle for a while, until they buffed weapon durability, and made the double durability perks actually work properly. .50 Cal did NOT need that buff lol. It's durability is a bit overpowered now, but shhh, don't tell Todd that. Now I repair my weapons like once a week, power armor once every month or so. The springs / screws / gears just keep piling up on my mule, as I'm still trained to pick up every typewriter, desk fan, kitchen scale, etc. lol. I so rarely see anyone asking for that stuff anymore. maybe screws once in a while for mass weapon crafting so they can craft / scrap and learn all mods, but that's about it.
---
I don't remember getting DLC for L4D2 for free;  I paid for the DLC I had
---
Let me tell you, I have had one of the shittest days, and reading this made my day! Lol. That is awesome to hear that there are good honest people that are really respectful playing the game now a day's, and that's the way it should be. I think this is a good start to rebuilding the foundations of Appalachia. Thank you for the share, I hope to see you in the wasteland. I wish you the best.
---
I know this is a joke, but dual wielding pistols would actually make them worth using.
---
Hahahaha
---
everyone in this thread deserves an upvote!
---
I seem to be perpetually short on screws....although I have like 400 springs right now.  It is what it is I suppose
---
Sorry.  Axe is a two handed weapon
---
So, guests can only drink, but cannot take? that's nice
---
it was free on PC
---
First few times id say grab a team. Just to learn what to do and to do quicker.
---
hence the "oh wait"
---
Also saw non-event, near Alpha, on the other side of the lake
---
I've never even found a Wendigo in there...
---
[](/celestiawink)I'm not joking in the slightest. I love the idea of Akimbo. Especially pistols, go full gunslinger with two single actions? ***HELL*** to the ***YES!***
---
You can do it alone - i did it myself at your level with basic un-modded X01 power armor + a non-legendary combat rifle. I would recommend a team tho if you can in case you go down and need a revive. But it's definitely doable - just make sure your silo hasn't been run before you go with that State Holotape(not sure if that's the right name) so you don't get to the end and can't launch. And make sure you have the keycard + code.
---
Screws are really cheap on PC now. You can get them for 1-2c each. No idea what they go for on console. I'm sitting on 2K+ of each - screw, spring, gear, etc. I only use them to craft free BoS Recon rifles for new players while I roleplay as a Brotherhood of Steel recruiter.
---
Easy to solo, they get harder based on the amount of people inside.
---
made me day right there
---
34 luck is the break-point to reach a crit every other shot (with perks)
---
If they make dual wielding pistols a thing... watch out wasteland, Roland Deschain is comin' to town, and he deals in lead.
---
only if you wear vault painted PA armor and skin the powerfists red....
---
idk if you know yet but the improved repair kits you can get from the queen do repair the Grognak to 150%
---
Some of my best drops have been wandering about map lately. I haven't had much luck hitting the normal spawn spots lately. First trip to the borrows felt like hitting the lottery. I haven't got a single drop from there since.
---
Someone sold a BE Black Powder rifle &amp; AA/25% fire rate gatling to the vendor before me yesterday, I'll always wait haha.
---
Amazon's, actually.

See comment.

Well I know what I'm renaming that chassis to.

If it is at PC platform, I can buy 5mm from you :)

Wanted to do 1h group but don't know if how often il have a partner.  Ty for the help!!

Activate pacifist before you go afk, saved my ass countless Times :)
---
How the hell are people still not using push-to-talk?
---
i remember that, but then why does it not show up as an atom shop item? and something you can build at any workshop/camp?
---
Thanks for the info; I'll definitely try to find a few people to come along.
---
Dual wielded Nunchaku Rolling Pins endorsed by Chuck Norris &amp; Bruce Lee :D. Come to think about it how about a Dual Wielded Junk Jet that can shoot carp 3 Star legendary weapons....Drills, Rolling Pins, Boxing Gloves, lead pipes, Buzz Blades......
---
You mean explosive weapons*
---
I‚Äôll sell ya each one for 1k
---
Sounds good. I'm sure I'll be able to find a couple of higher level people who'd like to lend a hand.
---
Does anyone else here agree with this idea?
---
Sell me stash space I would buy that
---
Sell me a bank vault usable by all you characters
---
just stay away from the pay to win sorta stuff like weapons and loot boxes and such
---
They need to make marine armor viable, first.
---
might've been 7th usually tuesday is maintenance days right?
---
North Mountain Lookout is where I found mine.
---
Remove the word made and the word paint and you got my upvote!
---
Is the West Virginia/Ranger paint limited?  I love that one and use it on both of my characters' power armors.  It's got a cool rain pattern/folksy vibe.
---
I agree with you that some solid, fundamental paints should be permanently available so as to dress up a dull stock skin.  (is forest camo still available?  not the best skin, but B- cool)  The addition of a basic ROYGBIV palette should be available.  They had it in the Creation Club in Fo4 for all power armors, so it should be a simple addition.  You could even mix and match paints on various pieces to create cool, interesting harlequin schemes with all 6 pieces of a suit. (google harlequin car color scheme for what I'm talking about)  You can get a lot of miles out of 7 basic colors with a bit of creativity and basic understanding of color theory.
---
That‚Äôs the item I‚Äôm in looking for the plan thanks tho
---
And still no paint for handmades ü§®
---
I take note of a few names that aren't at a vendor. That way if one of them logs off, or has their profile offline, I still have option to join off of.
---
"hatchet"... The weapon you are thinking of is "hatchet" it's like an axe.  Only not as intimidating. 
---
Unless of course there are a group of you who can dance
---
Punch with both fists? Sounds like a Star Trek punch.
---
Well, Warhammer Online: Age of Reckoning had quite a few players but never really made enough money and closed up shop.  City of Heroes was shut down because the devs lost millions of the dollars the previous quarter and were trying to streamline operations.  If you don't believe profit and loss margins are looked at when it comes to games, you are a fool.
---
I'd say fusion cells since I have 3000+ of them and won't use them because laser rifles are too weak for my taste. Sad, they were my favorite type of weapon in previous games.
---
But I do know I'm stupid for not picking up all of the .308 rounds, who'd knew I'd find [this beauty](https://i.imgur.com/WLNNa9u.jpg) later on.

Also cannonballs are worthless.

OMFG, I just noticed that my count on the springs is wrong. 15 are required for an L50 rifle. That's in the neighborhood of 6750 springs for 450 guns.
---
If u dont mind higher repair Costs - I run Body and both arms as ultracite and legs and helmet from x-01 as my mainset. Set gives 429/420/420.
---
I thought the level made a difference. Every little bit helps, so I'll try L40s. Thanks.
---
it says in the rules of reddit "Don't say [like for this] or [comment for this]

I will take them if Op doesn't want them or has gotten them already

Easy if you are lvl 3 lock pick and lvl 3 hacker. Takes me about 25 minutes to go solo. 
---
Pro tip: bypass the pipe repair
---
Pro tip: grab the cores and repair at your base going forward. Saves time
---
I just wish there was somewhere I could see the full list of previously available items....there's stuff I just didn't even SEE because I was out of town or what-not and no easy way to reference it.
---
And duel wield to be like a WolverIronMan
---
Well at that point the only faction left in Appalachia would be Roland's Ka-Tet.
---
Bethesda forgot the meaning of "micro" transactions. Shouldn't be rolling over $5 range you would think.
---
that's the difference then;  I had to pay for it because I was on xbox

Remember when you glitch stack foundations and everyone was pissed but now Beth is going to let us do it just saying

Im not home often so they prefer being in the bar cause the TV is their babysitter.

I was saving my atoms for this moment lol. Bought the Nukashine paint set and War Rider, they‚Äôre so sick.

Get creative with camps. Try PvP. Explore every inch of the map. Get the best legendary piece. Role play. Help others?
---
https://youtu.be/HBPrSO0w7As  here you see how to do it.
---
All you need is egouth ammo, some healing, nuke keycard and code from nukacrypt.com
---
It is doable with any weapon if you sneak
---
I look for a good central location where I'm a short travel to train stations, events, etc. My camp can be found across the street from Riverside Manor.

Checked everywhere

It was gone. Between one fast travel, so I know I didn't drop it

Also my skin of choice

That Nukashine paint is how you get me to spend real money in the Atom Shop Bethesda.  Nicely done.
---
Isn't operative the one you get from Enclave?
---
I just want to say thank you to everyone that gives gifts to newbirs. I'm no longer a newbie (just about) but when I first started I had a good handful of people just giving me weapons/armour with no way to repay them besides the heart emote. So if you do this, thank you!!
---
I am hoping so, excited to see what we can do with it. I have two bunkers which I can't open, so hoping we will be able to again.
---
Hell yes they will increase. Which is good cause I happen to have farmed quite a few of them lol
---
Yea I have the blood streaked and it looks cool. My only problem with it is that the pictures they posted didn‚Äôt show the shine to the armor. I was hoping for a flatish paint like BOS and have the gold/blood stains. Regardless it‚Äôs still my favorite combat armor skin that they have released. But that‚Äôs not saying much considering that they haven‚Äôt really released much for regular armor.

I figured. I put my house next to tanagra town just for those. I only have 6 left now cuz I gave 2 away to some cool cats I met the other night. Kinda kicking myself for it now.
---
I agree with you there. The claim is that marine is only second to power armor but my combat armor tends to get better stats than marine.
---
Yes but the shielded lining plans for it can only be found in one spot. Correction, COULD only be found in one spot.
---
Good thinking though, might be worth trying to look for or shoot flares up or something ..
---
Is it timed or can I get it later?
---
Just a heads up some code resellers have it extremly cheap
---
There's another bug that happens with event bosses where, when they turn into a meat/scrap pile they teleport to a specific spot.  It's not really their spawn point, since the Wendigo from "One Violent Night" spawns outside and makes it's way to a location a little in front of the stage; it's that point where his meat pile teleports too every time.
---
Another example is the MLQ in "Swarm of Suitors" her meat pile often, but doesn't always, teleport to the center island with the eggs, even though her pathfinding is so bad she only ever hangs out around the edge of the lake.
---
I use mine as long as I‚Äôm not running around in mixed armor sets. Marine would be a good one to make a hockey uniform out of. That‚Äôs about all it looks like now lol.
---
There‚Äôs caves in the game?  Man where tf have I been

You can get it later

Also dont hide on top of a building. She tends to land even less if ppl are hiding on top of any one of the buildings. So annoying when ppl do this.
---
I found that you can buy them from the enclave you just need to buy and apply each one then the new one became for sale. Took me 4 server hops lucky I had the flux to apply it
---
Think it was only 1000 caps or something like that
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
My endgame so far has looked like this: 
---
1. Leveling up to get new perk cards or transfer points to create a specific build. 
---
2. Farming Legendary Weapons and Armor for specific build.
---
3. Completing events looking for new plans and recipes.
---
4. Completing new quests and content as it releases. 
---
5. Exploring randomly as I travel to  events (I still discover new locations everyday 103hrs in)
---
5. Test builds in PvP Server.
---
6. Challenge/Achievement completion to farm atoms. 
---
I‚Äôm still having a blast with FO76, despite some of my closer gamer friends giving up on it early. And I try to talk to everyone I encounter in game as a push for a better ‚Äúsocial endgame‚Äù (played solo essentially until after 50)
---
I did this exact thing with my PS4 m, pretty sure I seeen this guy post it online so I actually tried and I have t blue screened or crashed since. It‚Äôs been 2 1/2 weeks. Not sure if it‚Äôs coincidence but I won‚Äôt complain
---
Ah well damn. I didn't know they would unlock as you purchased them. Oh well, my way was much cheaper on my part. At least theres still a way to get them if your not willing to pay for it
---
That makes sense. I will keep that in mind.
---
Lol I have a few of a bunch of different underarmours
---
I do the same, sometimes it can be a pain having to sacrifice 1 perk of another. But then again I guess that‚Äôs very much intentional in Bethesda‚Äôs part to try and keep things balanced.
---
I feel like dual wielding pistols should be a thing. Instead of aim, it would fire left, and vats would still work. Crit would only apply once to whichever side was fired after activation.
---
i agree it cant come soon enough
---
Which sign do you mean? A or B? [https://imgur.com/a/JDWuXyu](https://imgur.com/a/JDWuXyu)
---
Idk where to find the other ones so I've just been farming these ones. Looks like I'll have to find another vending boon lmao
---
SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE!
---
I hear you there, 45 stimpaks the one time doing all the work, and when I die, no one helps you out, they steal your loot and run and wait until you come back and finish the bitch off! 10 stupid wolf fedoras, worth 9 caps each! Just enough for one stimpak, or 2 blood packs. Kind of a joke. I think that the rewards should be based on how many times you hit pylons and hits on imposter sheepsqauch. Top players should get 10 stimpaks  4 blood packs and a  legendary reward. Those who don't cut it,  get nothing. Same should go for the SBQ, and any other events. I wish you the best, hope to see you in the wasteland.
---
New ultra-gory Raider blood sport. Power fight cage fights. Get chem'd up and come on down! 
---
Power fists and Nuka-shine provided!
---
Yes. I run Gunsmith 3 and Makeshift Warrior 5, and repair every 48 or so play-time hours on my main melee and rifle. And, I spend a lot killing things in those hours; they're getting heavy usage. It just makes things simpler not having to carry backups or wander off looking for repair stations. (I am getting quite the supply of super repair kits built up, but until they take the regular  out of the AS, I'm not touching them.) 
---
I flip to Gunsmith 5 and Makeshift Warrior 3 for Queen fights because I run a bloodied explosive  . 50 cal. Can run over 15,000 rounds through (multiple fights), no problem. Over-repair to 200%, slap on the cards (and one of Lucky Break or whatever the magical gun repair perk is for good measure), and get to kicking some ass.
---
I never run out of springs or screws.
---
Only alcoholic beverages can be added to it
---
Do you really believe there are no costs to running a server if you own the server?
---
I just found the plan for the first time last night, so I was surprised. I went and checked and I can still get in.
---
Yeah i would like the ability to edit after as well - especially with the lack of filters/frames on the new camera photos. A couple of times now I've been like this is a neat photo but it needs something more and I have to switch to camera mode to take a better picture.
---
Right! Seriously I'm right there with yea
---
Most games have a period of time beforehand to let folks download the game rather common practice
---
Pfft, what else would someone do with all those White Russians made on accident...
---
I like your style
---

---
I desperately want a frog pet :(
---
Weird the keypad was totally covered when I just went. Hopefully it opens for me again I guess. Weird.
---
Yea I don‚Äôt understand
---
What was it covered with? Maybe it's a server glitch? Try rebooting the game and checking. I'm curious too now.
---
While true...I doubt there are many people who think the Garrahan Extractor paint job is cooler than War Rider.
---
I don't understand how a community can criticize a game for not have enough content and then suggest Bethesda **remove** content from the game. This is a ludicrous idea. Should we remove all creatures from survival while we are at it?
---
i just want to be able to use a POWER first in POWER armor.
---
Because there are people out there so pathetic that they will go to the effort of faking evidence against somebody
---
cmon now people, this is a Bethesda game we are talking about
---
having her jump through all these hoops just to have the game do the same thing isnt cool
---
I play lots of games on my PS4, but only FO76 crashes constantly, server disconnects, and game freezes
---
I could see if she said ALL games are messing up on her, but im willing to bet its only FO76
---
all of this is on Bethesda's side
---
i do, however, hope it helps you, and pleae report back
---
This is one case id be very happy to be proved wrong!
---
If you are on Xbox id happily buy a shotgun from you
---
I wpuld get the free weekend version cleansed of as many major bugs before doing a free weekend
---
If you‚Äôre extremely quick with picking and hacking yes, it may save half a minute. It‚Äôs easier to just repair the reactor
---
Thanks for the helpful video!
---
Brilliant
---
I have 120 hours into the game and I‚Äôve only come across one chainsaw and it was level playing 20. I hung on to it because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I‚Äôd ever find another one.
---
Yep, that death one checks all my boxes.  Maybe if war looked more space marine and less distopia samurai.
---
&gt; I've sacrificed performance to run shadowplay full time now. 
---
Brave soul. My rig was considered a supercomputer back in 2017, and I get horrendous frame drops using shadowplay. I know recording is incredibly hardware intensive, but come on, they can surely do better than this...
---
Emergency contact can pick them up ;)
---
It's the same on PC I remapped it to my mouse and it still says Q
---
Ohhh, I see what you mean. Fair enough, I agree!
---
It was available during the beta, but then was ‚Äúremoved‚Äù in the final release of the game. However, people were to access it again when they glitched into the developer room.
---
It appears you're right. This whole time I was under the impression it was two shot weapons thanks to tse's. I never really used them much anyways.
---
It would make more sense from a game mechanic perspective that if a single shot consumes durability then shooting an extra bullet would consume more, but hey I'm not a dev lol
---

That happened to me when my PS4 pro hard drive was ready to hit the grave. Luckily it‚Äôs not hard to get a new hard drive these days. I changed mine out to a solid state drive and working flawlessly aside from the obvious issues with the game. Such as the 5 second load up lag and the occasional blue screen.
---
I‚Äôm not saying your hard drive is going to crash but that‚Äôs how mine happened. I know that after each to every other patch, I reinitialize my hard drive and install the game again. Bethesda isn‚Äôt the best at not corrupting their own game with patches. Which I can confirm that when you start getting a lot more than usual blue screens, it‚Äôs because the game itself is corrupted. I reinitialize the hard drive because those crash logs build up quick and clutter things up. PlayStation has nothing to actually maintain your hard drive. 
---
On a side note, Sony put extremely sub par hard drives in the PlayStations. If you lookup hard drive specifications for the PlayStation and then compare it to just a normal basic laptop, it‚Äôs not even close to what I‚Äôd consider usable. Hopefully with the PS5 that is in production will be more in the hands of the user and allow us to do regular maintenance without having to reformat the hard drive.
---
Still better alternative then the early ones that just can't be used except on one armor.
---
ive been hopping for awhile here, looking for the trick or treaters, and have only come across the dead brahmin :(
---
Depends on the trigger, trip wire seems to be the worst. You‚Äôd just have to mess with it a bunch. I have some spring board traps wired (PS4) if you want to check them out
---
Confirm, it comes from mirelurk hatchling, just tested my self.
---
Why!? I want to know why it‚Äôs removed! It makes no sense why they won‚Äôt let people know about this! It‚Äôs legit AF as far as trading pages go. It‚Äôs the only sub I even look at when it comes to trades and barters.
---
But then again shooting a explsive bullet is sure to take a larger toll then shooting s normal one, plus ts has a accuracy nerf since shooting 2 bullets is less accurate then 1
---
I cant get the bbq one either.
---
It is in some places, two of my mates got the game at this price a few weeks ago
---
every single fallout game other than 76 actually. if you have the perks, missiles used to be devastating.
---
I've waited in line behind PLENTY of players at vendors! No one ever takes very long and it's also a GAME! Some people... but on the bright side, it's pretty great that bethesda figured out how to turn griefing around so it has no real effect on you but does expose them as a douche!üôÉ
---
Yeah, and it‚Äôs used to cheese out of getting staggered and thus breaking their damage reduction via sentinel. Needs patched.
---
Thanks that's good to know!
---
Is there a plan for these or just a mod?
---
I used the one at grafton steel workshop, you just have to go to the helipad and repair it.
---
im forced to use 10mm and 44 aswell and they are still very weak. you need a crapload of ammo on you at all times. Laser pistols and plasma pistols do nothing at all and that is what I want to use.
---
I'm terrified of any good robots (the charleston vendor, legendary protectrons, etc) because it seems half the time they just die if I get close. I don't have any perks, mutations, or mods that cause local damage. They just love to drop dead because I'm an ugly duckling with 4ch
---
When you go to take a picture, the camera has to register what it sees for it to count for the challenge. It's a bit of a pain, but you will see a list of things that register in the frame up in the top right corner when aiming the camera. Hope that helps!
---
Well considering our severely irradiated diets, this doesn't seem so strange. It may go in solid but it's all gonna come out as boiling hot brown water.
---
There seems to be a group of cheaters for PC and they are always lead by one person it seems name raider_legened * not sure if it's against the rules*
---
ok so youre using a vats build. i dont have a vats build.
---
Do you have any to have the whole excavator set? I had the arms only but could not pull more than 80 ores.
---
I hate when people walk through walls irl. So lame.
---
According to the website Bethesda says if you buy it online (for console) it applies it automatically to the linked bethesda account. So I think it is still happening behimd the scenes.
---
I called Bethesda for clarification because I want to know if I buy a used copy if it will auto link to my account or if it is already linked to someone elses.
---
Nice job! Where did you find the mod my good man?
---
No that was specifically for retail accounts
---
I‚Äôm using laser and plasma on my main. Make sure you are suing gunsmith 5 and weapon artisan for max repair. And try and get the tubes gamma capacitor for both. The damage and burn are beautiful. Imo both work wonders on SB even though they have decent resistance to them. 
---
Try to keep them as semi. The automatic and sniper barrels are cool but don‚Äôt don the either justice.
---
Had this happen yesterday
---
responses so far.
---
use a vats build
---
use a bloodied build
---
use 10mm or 44 
---
I just want proper weapon balance why does nobody acknowledge this game doesnt have that? Why does nobody admit that Fatman, missile launcher and laser/plasma pistols are absolutely worthless even with all the specific perks for them???
---
This is where i found mine as well. The outfit is there with a witches hat, and the skeleton mask is at freddys house of fears. (Costume shop in NE of map).
---
It might but I haven't noticed a difference. I was crafting level 15 handmade and still learn something every time. Also I'm sure you know already but for anyone reading this that doesn't know, use super duper 3 when crafting anything (doesn't work for alchohol) for 30% more items
---
Thats beautiful, but why those flying bastards never shows in corner, even if i am on melee range? 
---
Brroooookeeen
---
Going to try, thanks!
---
Forgive me ‚Ä¶  how do you xfer items between your own characters?
---
Yeah they are entirely different styles of games. We are not on the same page as to what kind of online game this is. It has more in common with mmorpgs than standard multiplayer servers.
---
Snipe everything.
---
Games teach us to problem solve and real life teaches us manners! Well... most of us..
---
Cait, Piper, and the Vaul-Tec rep's outfits were all in an early datamine! https://imgur.com/a/tnLDhQC
---
Friends. Hand them to a mate, switch characters and take them back. Works with caps too.
---
Well it uses the same type of ammunition and it doesn't explode until impact so that doesn't make much sense to me. However I suppose from a game mechanic perspective it would be in order to balance out the effect.
---
I feel that the possibility of self infliction (from splash damage) should be more than enough. I know that you can run fireproof or armor to negate that but still, to each their own I guess.
---
I want to dual wield walking canes
---
When I‚Äôm in a server I make it my duty too go hunt down people with massive bounty‚Äôs. If they have a huge bounty they‚Äôve done something evil. If it‚Äôs 20 caps or above bro. Ur fukked. I‚Äôll hunt u down.
---
pistols?? how?? I have laser and plasma pistols with all pistol perks and they do nothing.
---
Look dude. Straight up I‚Äôm trying to explain to you how this works for us console players and you‚Äôre just trying argue left and right now.   You buy the game.  It‚Äôs a physical disc.  You put that in your console and you play it.   Go to GameStop‚Äôs website. Look at them selling pretended copies.... I‚Äôm sorry it doesn‚Äôt work that way for pc.
---
Omg that's awesome! Take my money lol :)
---
Yeah, you are very wrong about this. But enjoy your power armor if that does it for you, I'll be over here chilling in my better-in-every-way legendary gear.
---
I have gunsmith 5 and weapon artisan btw. also science maxed with upgraded mods
---
They said that they would be releasing it later on Steam along with all other future Bethesda games and skipping the EGS (Epic Game Store)
---
I don't use power armor, why do you think I'm complaining about it?
---
So- I see the new skins are for most of the PA available. Do they just make them look the same? or is there a variant of the War Rider for T-45, T-51, X-01, etc
---
PvP is not content - PvP is what you add to a game when you're too lazy to build actual content.  Survival mode took a lot less to build compared to even the Sheepsquatch storyline.
---
If you have a side retail business, you should try offering limited run items and marketing them via AdWords, Instagram, FB, etc. I do that once a month on average and it‚Äôs much more effective than regular ads. 
---
FOMO is real and the limited run items drive people to my site(s) and often they‚Äôll purchase other items at the same time (items they probably would‚Äôve never purchased if they weren‚Äôt driven to my store by the curiosity of the limited run item). 
---
If I offered the same item not as limited run, people wouldn‚Äôt feel an urgency to purchase and probably wouldn‚Äôt buy anything at all because they‚Äôd take time to think it over (and eventually forget). If an item does really well and it sells out quick, I‚Äôll bring it back a few months later for another limited run. This also drives signups to my email list because those customers are offered the items 24 hours before I run ads for them.
---
When we have towns, and I can start an RP group, you are first in line. This thread made me smile too dang hard.
---
In the first few days of the game i found myself doing events, getting a little bogged down by like 20 scorched at once, and feeling immediate relief when another player showed up to join in. Not a typical reaction to a random player encounter in a multiplayer game. Bethesda made the game but we made it great.
---
No, it needs to go on sale.  I'm talking on PC.  It's not a 60 dollar game. It should be like 30, max.
---
My experience has been the Apex Predator changed with levels. Used to be Wendigo, then Snallygaster, Deathclaw, Scorchbeast....
---
For me the creature I fear most is a level 50+ Mr. Gutsy. His ammo eats through me.
---
Deacon disliked that.
---
You are welcome :)
---
Mine work fine, i have corn on a round rug, add me if you want em :)
---
What a waste. 
---
What was wrong with the old method?
---
1) Chase a low level player down for 10 minutes, waving periodically until they stop. 
---
2) Drop your stuff
---
3) Shoot at it for 5 minutes, spam your flashlight on and off at it, jump up and down on it, crouch pointing your gun at it for another 10.
---
4) Confused low level disconnects from server. 
---
5) Win
---
Not the US version.
---
For digital copies.  Like amazon and such.  Physical discs are still the same deal as a dvd. The disc is what you need to have.  Hence preowned copies.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs the guns you have. I assume their maxed?
---
Try looking for legendary ones. I find vampires and furious on lasers really good. And anti armour plasma to help boost the ballistic damage they deal to hit harder. 
---
Imo laser and plasma pistols are ideal for main weapons. But can work fairly good as side arms. 
---
Are you on Xbox?  I can try and craft a pretty decent pistol one to help out if so.
---
Why not have a link or two to subreddits where you can, then?
---
Phew that's a lot of info. I'll pass it on to my friend. The thing is, we're merchants, and I'm just helping set up the perks. He already has a character, so this is just a respec idea. I did update it slightly. [New Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7935658&amp;d=ir2pd2e31pk2pl2lt2cr0ce0c52l71s12sb2sv3la2a72a91&amp;w=&amp;n=&amp;m=2g)
---
Yeah I HATE that aspect of FO76 - the digital overwhelm that they program in there for some reason, where you don't get two or three, or 3 or 4 or 5, but, as you say 20 - literally - and you're supposed to take care of these ALONE.
---
Im also currently having an issue with loading that area. Just started having this issue today. I go in and the game freezes during the loading screen.
---
Lol right? I had this guy running in and out of the train station while waiting for me. Maybe he was just running in circles. You could hear the sound of his PA rising and fadingü§£
---
I walked into a cave and a level 70+ chameleon Deathclaw tore me a new one. That was the last time I explored without power armour on.
---
Learnt that the hard way.
---
They would certainly be more threatening if they could still grapple.
---
I really liked pipers outfit. It was my favourite. Just looked cozy. I also liked elder maxsons battle coat.
---
Herpes fery vendor, server hop. I had 3x those 4* machete. It have weak damage, but look cool
---
Anyone who says these microtransactions are supporting the game are fools, it's purely profit driven. Devs get paid regularly just like everyone else with a job at a company, the game could flop or explode and they'd see no pay change. Shareholders are the only ones being supported by this nonsense.
---
Honestly don‚Äôt remember, had it in my stash for ages :)
---
And the inventory, like with 4.
---
Im almost positive its quilt patterns, in northern AZ they also place patterns like that on homes because of quilting season.
---
 If anyone wants a physical copy for Xbox one send me a message I can sell 1 for $30
---
Oh ok. I thought it was some urban legend or cultural thing with a specific name.
---
Not sure what you mean by that. The code is global and can be activated in any country.
---
I stop everything and mute them when that happens.
---
Yeah sure! You get to live in the golf course while all us hard working blue collar decent folk all gotta live in flatwoods! Brag more about yer mansion, richie rich!

I do. War rider is uuuugly imo
---
I do run super duper @ max. I get SD procs maybe 15-20% of the time when I am making guns.
---
I think they need a free weekend since there are a ton of people who still think the game is how it was at launch, it's waaay better.

I don't know why you got downvoted, I only found a Wendigo in there once or twice, but never when the daily challenge asked me to. F.w.i.w., they could rename the place Mirelurk King Cave.
---
Now THAT'S a farm if it works
---
Please tell me what section are the eggs ( I got them all but have no idea where they're located I've looked everywhere)
---
There are 3 spawn points for the chainsaw, all of them are only lvl 20.
---
Yeah they are called Barn Quilts
---
I‚Äôve been farming the Free Range event, not just for sheepsquatch but also the rare plans that drop from it. Framed for multiple days and still need the electrified staff plans. I received them, but they‚Äôre glitches and unlocked the electrified club instead. It‚Äôs still called the electrified staff but it‚Äôs obviously an incorrectly named club
---
Dual Wielding could be a interesting Legendary effect if they wanted to do that. We kinda do need better secondary legendary effects.
---
Cazzador is still king ;)
---
It starts here, reading through the quest blurb adds context to their intent and ambitions

---
I know! Ever just jog through a town, hear a feral ghoul, turn around and see like 10 or 15 chasing you? I don't know how many times this has happened to me.
---
Yeah I definitely am more afraid of dealing with a Yao Guai than a deathclaw.
---
That puts you to have grown up in the birthing of the gaming era. It is not surprising at all that you get into the ideas of gaming.
---
Just INCREDIBLY annoying.
---
There are things I like about FO76, but this is definitely not one of them.
---
It's what I do, just sit and wait now. Before I would place land mines around them if they went afk for 5-10mins. Only time I wish I had slap damage back. Why goto a vendor then run off because you gotta poop.
---
Oh no. Not Piper.
---
Ha, anything can be viable with the right perks.
---
I learned this from AWOL armaments. The legendary at the end spawned as a boss, I shot it, then it mutated into a 3 star afterwards. Received no loot.
---
Just half an hour ago I experienced the latest instance of this 'glitch'.
---
Server was a bit iffy - a party launched three nukes back-to-back - and I was really 'in the groove' killing ghouls.
---
Put one between the eyes of a 3* as soon as it 'turned' legendary, went down like a sack of potatoes but he had the last laugh because 'no legendary loot for joo sucker'.
---
Did a 'full circuit', revisited the corpse 15 mins later - there is an urban legend that says that if you revisit the corpse after a while the coveted legendary will be there waiting for you - but nope, there weren't any sewer alligators or legendary items in the container.
---
And aren‚Äôt there way more mods for it?
---
I too am experiencing this bug. I can't aim down my sights with any weapon/sight in first person, only third person and I can block with melee weapons. I uninstalled all mods, cleared the .ini and did a fresh install of the game but I still have the issue.
---
I've only done that after 15mins of waiting because they went afk and so many of us are waiting. Otherwise hell i understand looking at goodies sold during nukes :) a emote would work lol
---
Viable compared to other non-pa armor types. From what I understand, it‚Äôs useless and you might as well never move on from leather and metal.
---
Also seen this guy online. Killed him many times but he and his group killed me atleast as many times 3v1. I did not notice anything shady tho, he just had exploding laser weapon with crit build and assasins/sentinel armor
---
I saw some wood piled up at this rustic log house looking barbecue place. Immediately smashed (A) in my mind. Gotta collect them wood scraps!
---
This seemed to happen earlier to me today during the sheepsquatch event. Had two squatches spawn, both not legendary, attacked them both, then one went legendary and one went 3 star legendary. Neither dropped anything (no drills/syringers either) waited around, fast traveled away and back, etc. What you're saying fits with what I saw.
---
Sack hood, farmers clothes, sickle and cultist blade.
---
Children of the Corn/Cult of the Mothman build complete.
---
Yeah it definitely feels lower than 30% to me
---
Still on?
---
They're in the Floor Decor section, to the side of the atom shop Deathclaw statue.... might be under Floor Decor instead, can't recall, one of the two.
---
The English and their queues.  =)
---
Post your image to Imgur then link the Imgur post in the text body.
---
pimple armor
---
They can hit the broadside of a barn.  More often than what I want them to hit, unfortunately.  Though the barn does have good airflow now.
---
Marine armor is very viable with the right legendary effects. Super good for sneak since the pieces weigh less than a pound with ultralight mods. I'm currently in the process of collecting a bunch to put together the ultimate PvE set. Planning to have at least 15% damage reduction against every enemy in the game plus a couple sentinel and cavalier pieces for further reduction. Then mix in some AP refresh and reduced food and junk weight. When I get everything it should be pretty amazing.
---
I agree that the basic gear is strictly mid-grade though.

Thank ya, friend.

why?

Awesome idea
---
Hmm... I'll go into a super mutant spawn.
---
The deathclaws hit hard if you let them, but they need to be much tankier. Even my trash rifle build killed them easily before they closed the gap. The sheepsquatch is in the right ballpark.
---
Mr. Gutsy just thinks you smell like communism

Just dont play PvP if you have these problems!

Won't buy any of them.  They're kinda cool looking, but not nearly enough.  And doesn't it only work on one set of power armor, or make all power armor models look like the same model?  Pass.

The worst thing they do is put the limited time. I love the two new armor skins but I do not have atoms. I was thinking about paying 14 euros for one of them but not 24 for the two. In the end I see myself so fucked up by not being able to have both if I do not loose a fortune that I prefer not to buy any. For my part a sale less.
---
PD: Already last week I bought the one from the plague.
---
Kinda useful if you're on a team for mopping up lower health enemies. I use my executioners lever rifle a lot.
---
People in hell want ice water. 
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs gonna happen.
---
If the pylons aren't blue/electrical, then they aren't active. The only way to know which one is which is to walk up to it and see what the name is. After that, you just remember the position.
---
went to go buy the card this morning and the  white springs train vendor wanted 2300 caps for it, and my poor  level 51 vault rat said ya know I think doing that veil of mystery side quest sounds fun lets hunt down 6 different creatures and kill them with a sword instead.
---
I want to wield Power Fists in PA.
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
I posted earlier but I want to also add that if you're on xbox I'm a level to260 and would be happy to show you around and help you as much as I can!
---
60$? The game costs 15euro in every platform where i live.
---
What is that hat?
---
I use the maxed out "Weapon Artisan" perk when repairing, it gives you I believe double the durability, it works great..
---
Can I buy the handmade plan off someone. I‚Äôll pay you all my caps if I have too
---
Fallout 1 even states that Deathclaw populations were scarce until The Master reproduced them. They weren‚Äôt as strong and didn‚Äôt even look the way they do now before that but they‚Äôre everywhere in Appalachia, there‚Äôs one around the corner from my CAMP
---
1. Why should they pander to your play style? 
---
When you‚Äôre that level, you‚Äôll have the equipment to do the same. It sucks but honestly you‚Äôll be the same soon enough.
---
2. Don‚Äôt go on survival and keep pacifist on?
---
3. What the hell has that got to do with you? If they do indeed spend all of their spare time playing, that‚Äôs not really any of your business.
---
This should definitely be a thing. They do it for others
---
Silliest thing ever to install mods that only you can see... Or mods period.
---
Nuka Shine Beer Hat in Atomic shop
---
Looks weird
---
While this might sound silly, I think it would be nice to keep the world model of a Mod still the same orange box but when we inspect the mod item it would be nice to see what part looks like.  
---
Example: if you have a Bow bar chainsaw mod I would like when inspecting it to see its effect along with what appearance changes it makes.
---
FootBall mask
---
Beats nocturnal between 6AM and 6PM and is better than Stalker's on a melee weapon or Ghoul Slayer's on a Gamma Gun :P
---
Silliness aside I guess if the HP pool on the mob is large enough - Impostor, 'squatch, SBQ - to warrant a weapon swap 60% into the' fight' and you don't have/don't benefit as much from AA beats TS (more damage, no accuracy penalty) and Furious (no 'ramp up' or 'reset') in the last 40%.
---
There's only a few specific locations that spawn "tameable" creatures/animals.

Sorry missed

That‚Äôs quite a bit of time to implement a single gas mask. Hopefully they implement it soon.

Does your house frequently get nuked? No?! So surprising..

---
Feel free to add me.
---
Gotcha
---
Well, as it‚Äôs Enclave, you can go to the production area, get whatever level plan you are up to, learn it, then start hopping servers until you get the next level of it, rinse and repeat until you have it maxed
---
Adding now :)
---
Well of course not!! Nobody nukes the shitty part of town!!
---
It is, I don‚Äôt understand why it wasn‚Äôt given to us from launch as a cosmetic or Gas Mask like many others, it clearly acts like a full head like the scout gas masks. My only reasoning to not having it is reworking or dlc thus far
---
Thank you to whoever gave me Gold by the way I love you. &lt;3
---
Yeah I wasnt willing to do that lol. I'm sure plenty of people are but I collected and sold a whole bunch so I'm not the only one in my crowd either
---
Some rando just showed up at my CAMP one time and dropped plans for the gauss rifle. And then ran off. I barely got to say thanks!
---
I have no idea who asked for this but it's such a good idea! I now need to build a cult house centered around the punch bowl.
---
Yes sir, shoot me your gamertag and I'll invite to party
---
Thanks awesome!
---
I'm not fond of the ones who play music so loud their mic picks it up and they wont turn the mic off so I have to mute them.
---
Lol that rules! The extent to my role-playing is my "temple of poo" camp which is just a church with a toilet to worship. I have tasteless imagination in games ;).            -hail Satan!
---
thank you so much this worked!
---
Considerably better than launch, still a buggy mess.
---
Generally pretty good fun. Just prepare for a few (hundred) frustrations along the way.
---
Does it take linings? If so which one? (casual I guess?)
---
small group. Guaranteed 3 to 5 people
---
It's fun watching people drink it and then hear there reaction.
---
Useful on faster swinging melees and any automatic weapon. You don't need to invest all 5 ranks unless you have something crazy like a fire rate lmg.
---
Uhm every game with free updates also got microtransactions and memberships that pay for the updates.
---
Gta, destiny and overwatch to throw random, different types of games out there
---
XB1
---
Daily quests will be lost for the day if you log out without completing them. As far as the daily drinking quest goes, you just need to go talk to the robot and he‚Äôll give you the quest.
---
Totally agree!  I've gone back several times in the hopes of completing the side quest of killing a Wendigo while wearing a clown costume and there's usually only a tough Mirelurk King in there.
---
Somebody plays on a console.
---
Woah. That's awesome! I'm absolutely getting that one!
---
There is a bit of an ongoing issue with quests in this game. I can do the nukashine stuff still but mire dailies haven't started in months. It's weird how different groups of quests are effected for different people.
---
Well here I am just here to piss on your bonfire. It's not.
---
They recycled it from the "let's cook" emote.

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
If we are going to go that far, we might as well just have a small lore tab along with the effects.
---
No i play on the pc im afraid.
---
PS4? You aren't coming up if so.. try adding me, same as username just with a - at the end
---
No such luck.  And my daily quests have been lost for months unfortunately.  Thank you for the response though.
---
Pale Rider is next and then we get Black Rider, going in order of how the Horsemen of the Post-Apocalypse were encountered in Fallout Shelter
---
So what I mean does it matter if I wear cloaking wood armor vs super heavy for pvp or is it just for pvp that matters
---
It‚Äôs massively better, Bethesda has listened to much of the criticism and responded well on almost every occasion. There are still bugs that need addressing and some recent decisions have been somewhat contentious..
---
(For the love of god, nobody mention repair kits lol).
---
On the whole it‚Äôs much better than at launch and continues to improve. It really is loads of fun but far from perfect yet.
---
Thank you for the response.  I'm just so frustrated - I've been playing since release - but I keep missing out on so much stuff - its really frustrating.
---
So, How many power rangers are required to form that thing?  \^\_\^
---
Just spawn a nuke keycard.
---
glad it worked
---
I'm not sure if I'm missing something or if they changed it but I play ESO and can see my buffs and my debuffs on a boss
---
Probably a HD issue.
---
Yep, for 1.  Still looking for another.  I can get 5,000 caps in a few days; however, I've been playing for months with limited success at the Enclave vendor.
---
I'm a postman, and routinely deliver to a primary school.
---
Saw a huge stack of those plastic meal trays with the diving sections in, it made me so weirdly excited to see all that plastic.
---
I got mine when I took over a workshop and spawned a vertibot
---
I'm just happy it's no longer tied to "longest life".
---
Though it is quite annoying when I'm off doing my thing, come across another player that tries to kill me, I kill him and am then hunted down because I'm the only one on the server who has made a kill during that life.
---
Yeah I'd like to see a little more love on it.  There's no power attack for it, just a gun bash.  It's a fun, steady, lazy way to do a fair amount of damage, but could be much more with a little love.  I broke mine on a SBQ today while she was grounded and disabled.  LOL
---
you, sir, are the real MVP.
---
how would you take them off
---
I'm sorry but I cant believe this. You could have gone to a different vendor like a normal person lmfao or this story is fake
---
I don't fixate on petty goals like weapon mods. I just let that stuff happen naturally.
---
I expect my team to equip, feed, and care for themselves, otherwise they aren't much of a goddamn team. It's not like food and chems are hard to come by...
---
Plus healing salves are on the challenge list
---
Nice tip, done it 10 times now, only got the  squatch  1 time , but a lot of nice enemies :)
---
The plans for the club etc.. can you only get them from "free run" or can i also get them here ?
---
Yaaas that's the spirit!!
---
I‚Äôve just added you! PSN is EtherealOcean378 :) Always happy to have new people to explore the wasteland with. I‚Äôve just turned lvl 49, but I‚Äôm down with doing w/e regardless of anyone else‚Äôs level.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm all down for PvP just not the forced PvP that comes with the top 3 map markers. At least make that optional so we can decide whether we wanna spend the night death matching or just play the game.
---
I know the feeling, as I say it's been months with the mire dailies and I've seen plenty of posts saying the same but so far no acknoweldgement from Bethesda that there's even a problem.
---
The event ‚ÄúCollision Course‚Äù is how I‚Äôve done this one. It‚Äôs in the northern part of Morgantown in the airport. It‚Äôs exceptionally simple and rewards you with a cargo bot delivery on the spot that will register for this challenge. Even if it doesn‚Äôt show as a current event on the map you can often start the quest up just by passing through the back of the airport, near the landing pad area. I‚Äôve had trouble getting the nuclear keycard bot to register for this. Not saying it can‚Äôt be done but this is an easier method and it‚Äôs 100% reliable.
---
Nobody has got there accounts back they were lifted for some accounts for about a week then resuspended. Don‚Äôt wait around
---
Would not be that hard to do. If you spec into Melee you have enough Strength to also take Shotgun, Melee, and Heavy.
---
I'd rather deal with a deathclaw than a stupid cave cricket. Fuck those guys.
---
If you need help I‚Äôm on pc and usually on every day.
---
My bets are on mid May early June
---
But mostly likely early June when the DLC and content output slows down
---
I wish they'd at least kept the decorations up üòÇ
---
Ask the level 800 i seen before the ban hammer came down. Have not seen a high level like that since most has been 350ish
---
I wouldn't expect too much, they had some really interesting photos of the burrows and currently unseen outfits in 76. But they never came with the burrows, i guess it's artistic freedom.
---
I still haven't used my card for my own event. I'm worried that no-one will turn up!
---
Workshops are content. Monster mash is content. Hunter/hunted is content. That civil war reenactment quest is content. PVP is content. Suggesting it is removed is taking away content. How about next time you see SBQ, Encrypted, or the squatch event pop up, you skip it, forever.
---
Same situation. I don't have a kid, but I am studying and working. It's a bummer
---
You're simply glowing here.
---
I like this megapun.
---
Here are some of the suggestions I give people fairly often:  
---
**1) Are you doing good damage? I use a** [**damage calculator**](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) **to estimate my damage output with certain weapons to prioritize which weapons to use when. Do you have all the right perk cards on for best damage?**  
---
\- Weapon class damage 60% (ex. Rifleman or Heavy Gunner)  
---
\- Armor Penetration (ex. Stabilized or Tank Killer)  
---
\- Crippling (ex. One Man Army or Enforcer)  
---
\- Adrenaline 5, Tenderizer 3, Bloody Mess 3, Nerd Rage  
---
\- Are your weapons good? If you don't know the answer to this off the top of your head, then probably not. I'm not saying go out and buy a crazy expensive weapon but some effects are just straight up better for dealing damage than some 3\* weapons. Anti-Armor, Bloodied, Executioner's, Zealots, and Two shot are all pretty decent against her for squeezing out more damage.   
---
\- Any mutations? Adrenal Reaction is very good since it increases your damage for health lost, and in this fight you are generally not going to be topped off at 100% HP for most of it so you will benefit. IF you are melee player it might be worth it to look into Twisted Muscles or Talons for more damage.   
---
**2) If your damage isn't great there are still things you can be doing:**  
---
\- Endangerol Syringer Debuff - This weapon is still highly underutilized by the playerbase in this fight and it frustrates me because it removes 25% of the enemies Damage Resistance value for 2 minutes. The SBQ has a Damage Resistance value of 300 making it probably the tankiest enemy in the game currently, but after being hit with Endangerol she drops down to 225 DR effectively increasing everyones damage output.   
---
\- Tenderizer 1-3 - if you don't have a lot of charisma then rank 1 of this perk will give you good bang for your buck by increasing the damage the SBQ will take by 5% from all sources. Get rank 3 if you are really trying to maximize your efforts and have the charisma.  
---
\- Suppressor 3 - this card decreases enemy damage output by 10-30%, less damage means more people staying alive and not wasting time respawning  
---
\- Cryolator - Not seen often in this fight but can be a total game changer. If you freeze the queen she becomes easier to hit so people can do more damage, even better if you can freeze her on the ground for Melee-Bros to feast on her. (had a 5 min queen fight because two people froze her rock solid on the ground)  
---
\- Automatic Tesla Rifle - This weapon arcs between enemies tagging a lot at once and applying previous debuffs mentioned. This can be a great tool for clearing out trash that spawns and distracts the damage dealers.
---
When I saw my first level 50 deathclaw I heard the rumbling and I was like ‚ÄúOhhhh shit.....hmm....nah I can take him.‚Äù
---
I have to agree with you!
---
That‚Äôs so true. I have never died from a deathclaw, but I see a bear and I run for my life.
---
Wow, that's no good, I was thinking it was an over.  I love the mask and helmet combo though.
---
How about you find a better way to earn caps that leeching on poor players.  Instead of stretching to defend your lame means of obtaining caps.
---
THE GUN IS GOOD
---
THE PENIS IS EVIL
---
PRAISE TO ZARDOZ
---
Why do you feel it‚Äôs necessary to own everything you like? That‚Äôs the main issue. Just get what you want to wear and wear it. Don‚Äôt horde.
---
PSA: The difference between a temporary suspension without deadline or means to appeal and a permanent suspension is just semantics.
---
There may be some niche scenarios where the specific wording is relevant - if one has rapport or some form of leverage - but for the vast majority of cases just read it as 'ban'.
---
Unless you are Jeff Bezos and you can suspend the servers until they find a way to 'safely reinstate the accounts' you are pretty much SoL.
---
Use OBS instead of shadowplay, it's free, open-source and has a minimal overhead. Make sure to record to a different drive than the one your game's on too.
---
I would do it more if not for the BS 1 hit instant kill it can do when in full level 60 power armour. The conduits all so deal a tad to much damage not hauling 40 just to do the event.
---
I like this idea, but only for bags dropped when you die.  I don't want people tracking me down to beg for more if I leave a bag of unwanted ammo laying at the steps of the Whitespring Station.  And yes, you know there are people who would do exactly that.

Try the Mountainside B &amp; B. I've found a couple there in the basement on a shelf.

I‚Äôve noticed that these new ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù paint jobs change the actual model and are applicable on any power armor class. That‚Äôs nice in its own respect. It‚Äôs difficult to find all the pieces for my patriot skin.

In general, it'd be neat to have a peek to dual weild unarmed/punching weapons. Why not, right?
---
Grafton steel workshop, just go to the helipad and repair it, make sure it says vertibot to the left of the camera
---
I want Nick's outfit.  Hell, I want to play as a GHOUL, but I don't think that's ever gonna happen.
---
Right I get it, but I wouldn't put my money on Bethesda not wanting people to play their game, or being scornful and disingenuous about unbanning people, as they could just as easily sent everybody the "temp ban" email rather than having the differentiation between the two.
---
Not at all.  Sometimes the loot lags, sometimes things glitch.  But I've gotten loot from her after showing up when she's already in the air.
---
Agreed
---
It‚Äôs just manners, wait your turn like everyone else does
---
I believe it requires that all 3 be in the same photograph
---
Dont think its wise to keep the 2xp active all the time but atleast every other weekenf would be great
---
For me it was 9/10 and final 10 on Whitespring station.
---
Make sure you join the event if that option is available.
---
I added you back!
---
No worries firend I haven't been, has there been any other information about this then?
---
Before microtransactions, everything was subscription service
---
Seriously would settle to at least dual wield spiked knuckles he looks dumb with only one with two i would have the perfect wolverine build.
---
Weapon mods happening naturally means your weapons are pretty shit.
---
I really like it. I started using one on my commando purely because I'd put prime receivers on everything else and found it worked really well but I imagine it's down to build. Definitely goes well with automatic crits.
---
Duper got banned
---
says the guy still playing Anthem.  lol come on
---
I've tried it on iPhone and desktop.  It works well enough to do atom shop on the phone, and it works pretty great on the desktop.  It's gonna eat some bandwidth though and it won't try to connect if you're not on wifi.
---
The iphone version uses touch screen controls to simulate the DS4 controller, including thumb sticks.  The latency makes thumb stick tracking really imprecise, so you might be able to pull off some server hopping vendor shopping action, but real game play isn't feasible on the phone.
---
Again, the desktop version (at least on Mac) is rock solid.  As long as you have a solid connection, you won't be able to feel much of a difference than if you were at your console.
---
Very nice! The challenge technically makes it possible to get 10/10 during the event, but the conditions didn‚Äôt line up for me to achieve that this time out.
---
The generosity from most other players I've encountered playing FO76 wasnt what I expect the game to be like, Im even still using a lever action rifle a FO76 friend gave me like 60 levels ago when we first met, he walked to my old camp which at the time was like a quarter mile NE of the Red Rocket filling station, just to give it to me, probably saw I was me on the on the map that I was just high enough lvl to use it. I've made friends with people who teamed up and helped me complete quest with my brand new character, then I'll show them my main character and 'team up'. One time I'd been farming resources and accidentally got wanted, by picking a lock at a claimed workshop, I needed someone to kill me and not take it, making friends in the game has came in handy.
---
Plague and pox üòÄ

I Third This

Dad, is that you?
---
A glitch that has occurred for me is not being registered as being in the event.  That is, although you are standing next to the queen,  it has not appeared on your mission list.  I've had to back out and rejoin to get the mission active.
---
I sure hope so
---
There's leaks of the new perks on YouTube already. I don't think any of these things are covered though
---
This is true
---
I like it on low damage high Rate of fire weapons like the Gatling laser, or on rifles and other things it‚Äôs a good counter to the so fruitful bloodied build
---

Deathclaws have little to no lore, and what we know comes from an official - but not in-game - guide from Fallout 2. They were a pre-war genetical experiment that have been vaguely refined by the Master (we don't know how or why and he also never uses Deathclaws in his armies; it could even be a scrapped concept that was kept in the strategy guide).
---
 So, the Deathclaws we find can really just be the original Pre-War strain.
---
I suppose it could be justified lore-wise in that the FO76 is set in the earlier stages of the apocalypse, meaning it took the deathclaws 100 years (FO1, 2, Tactics, 3, New Vegas and 4) to adapt and evolve to the new ecosystem before coming out on top.
---
I seriously doubt the deva intended for people to initiate pvp by contesting the workshop and having your friend sneak attack someone on the other side of the map only to server hop as soon as he is dead. If you honestly think that‚Äôs the way the game was intended to play, you sir are a WANKER.
---
I hate how it makes any power armor you wear with it look like an X01
---
Oh I agree, my point was that progression (in some form) keeps people interested.  People will grind if there are regular "rewards" to keep them going, such as getting levels, legendary's, rare items, etc.  Keeping things super grindy to increase the time players spend in the game almost always leads to the opposite effect.
---
My buddy has only nukashine in his. He got me. I asked what he had in it. He told me to take a swig and see. I didn't think about it until after I did it and My screen turned purple.
---
Can you get any staff plans from the sheepsquatch encounters like this, or are they from the event?
---
Ha I know that cave, same thing happened to me. Then we both got attacked by a scorchbeast. I did not win
---
I think this may fall prey to the same mysterious issue that keeps us from being able to use our characters and the atom shop across all three platforms.  Ladydevann replied to me once saying there's no crossover for atom shop or characters, but she didn't elaborate as to why.
---
I think what would prevent them from rolling out an app would be, as someone mentioned in my question about platform hopping, the control of atom sales, especially with platform-specific 'summer sale' discounts if that sort of thing ever happens.
---
The amount of people who missed this joke is disheartening
---
Where are the eggs from Easter?
---
Legitimate question, what armor setups are better than per armor?
---
I was like "Oh wow, this lad looks fancy", right before they tore my arms off.
---
How about farming Sentry-Bots at Whitesprings for Fusion Cores?
---
Floor decor.  If you have the deathclaw statue unlocked, they're going to be in that section.
---
I use PS4 remote play to buy things from the atom shop when I‚Äôm not home. Not the answer you are looking for but something to consider until a better implementation comes up
---
They all need to be in the same photo and they all need to be listed in the upper righthand corner while taking the photo.
---
I completed this at Sunrise field. Had to wait for a bit during combat for the queen to spawn hatchlings. Also, dead bodies count, they don't need to be alive for the photo to count.
---
You could just block me. I don't mind.
---
Ah, that explains why I saw his brahman and companion eyebots the other day, but no vendor.  He'd already timed out.
---
There is probably a reason why they made that distinction, but is unlikely to be 'good customer service'.
---
The 'bait and switch' they pulled with the accounts or the silence that your ticket has been met with should give you a good measure of how much 'good will' there is from their side on this matter.
---
However if you want to be strung along that is definitely your choice.
---
Perfect example of how you need to be a boss to figure out where and what happened to your loot.  Casual players would just assume they lost out, which is not a good look for a game still struggling to find it's footing.
---
This guy sounded like a real peach, it's a shame he didn't get what he wanted.
---
Do you think maybe it's because we were outside of the nuke zone the whole time, so maybe it didn't think I was part of the event? We did the thing were we all stood at drop site V9 just outside the circle.
---
Is that possible? The event is inside a nuke zone and you can't fast travel there right?
---
I tried doing this once when someone was at my camp. I even said, "God damn Slocum's Joes!"
---
They didn't say anything. üòëüòë
---
Well, the Excavator part isn't really an issue since the horsemen skins can be applied to all the power armors.  Not that it negates the three other issues. =)
---
Then you get some 13 year old dopey kid who climbs the walls not understanding the event that's taking place.
---
Wish I was a part of the queue
---
Just tried and unfortunately it does not.  Kinda bummed out now lol.
---
Thanks for trying! At least we know now.
---
It's true. They should take a hint from Warframe and release [https://www.warframe.com/it/prime-access](https://www.warframe.com/it/prime-access) 44.99‚Ç¨ / 71.99‚Ç¨ / 125.99‚Ç¨ Atom packs.
---
...then add the possibility to purchase weapons, armor, equipment and perks. Also, they should add crafting timers, and make it so you can skip them with Atoms. 
---
Platinum is an in-game currency which can be bought with real  world currency or by trading with other players. It can be used to purchase warframes, weapons, equipment, sentinels, mod packs,¬†and other various items from the in-game Market. It can also be used to instantly finish crafting wanted items in the Foundry. 
---
Oh, and- I'm already ready to hear the 'but Warframe is free to play' excuse (it's a classic). So, yes. They should make FO76 free to play, then add all of that.
---
I wasn't referring to police. If they recorded it then yes, also they may do just that, I don't know. Either way a report shows negative behavior and if they are scummy as they seem, they will likely get more and can get booted for bad behavior. One little thing can add up and make a difference
---
stats for external games are biased. eve-online, for example, is 3k on steam, but 20k on server via custom launcher

I'm a level 25 on this toon, and I managed to kill a lvl60 3* ghoul, and I received 5 .308 rounds and an adjustable wrench. I was very very very sad.
---
How he figure just by putting up rocket turrets it translates into ruining the game for everyone else? Smh. He was just an ass wipe looking for an excuse to destroy your camp. And that‚Äôs the biggest problem I have with the game developers. Why they allow that to happen.
---
well fuck. I might have to pick up some atoms with my CC.
---
Sometimes i see the hexagon shape or whatever shape it is and you can select to join the event. Not sure if it is always there,  but with the screwiness of the servers I can imagine if you are not active in the event it sticks it to you somehow.....
---
Damn.  That is unfortunate.
---
The int, will never happen.
---
But if it decreased all items weight by 5%- 10% that be worth it.
---
I mentally collect wood piles irl lol!
---
It has its moments but so does every relationship haha.
---
Ooo capitals even! You are serious. He said he was attacked while in the workshop. I don't know what this business about friends attacking people on the other side of the map is? Did I miss something?
---
The INT perk is one that could be abused, unless it forces those junk items out of your stash when the card is removed it could be abused a little bit
---
I keep a few bottles on me in case I get jumped by something I'm not prepared or not able to fight.  It's gotten me out of a few jams.
---
Maybe they need to split into two currencies so they can balance them separately.
---
Too bad you're not on xb :(
---
If you die during the event the game will sometimes act as though you haven't joined.
---
If you die shortly before the queen, and don't get a hit in on her after you respawn, the game will sometimes forget all the hits you got in before that.
---
It's happened to me before. Seems to coincide with spawning away from the fight, like across half the blast zone.
---
Upvote, but I got to say 1 shotting the legendaries is a dick move.
---
Its the mods. The gun has the 90% weight reduction. But the mods on the gun dont.
---
You know what‚Äôs going to be a massive deal breaker?.. If they do an end of year/Anniversary Bundle of all 4 together for 2000 Atoms
---
Delete friends , I had a lot due to trading n had same prob but deleted most n it works fine now
---
I've likely contributed far more to this community than you have. Certainly more than the average player. How about you look at some of my top posts. Especially the gilded one where I talk about stacking damage bonuses to calculate and compare guns with melee DPS.
---
..for under $20, I'd say it's a great deal. I've been playing since Christmas, and still to this day am having an entertaining time..with a few frustrating disconnects thrown in here and there.
---
You right on. I missed The last deathclaw egg because of a trip. I even searched if It existed.
---
A furious ripper or Mr. Handy Buzz blade is just insane. The damage builds while you hit things and it absolutely shreds.  My furious buzz blade is my go-to for the SBQ when she lands.
---
I keep finding guys with beeping backpacks/codes.  Don't know what to do with them so just let them disappear in my inventory.
---
Where are they?!
---
The unlucky part is that I literally never go AFK, only did it this one time and I was still at my desk but looking at another screen for a minute. I think there was an unlucky perk in Fallout 2 that woulda applied to that.
---
I really could use those, I hate using the flag trick to get some privacy.
---
Sheepsquatch is tougher than I'd want deathclaws.  They need to be tougher, but not that much tougher.
---
Yeah i agree that progress keeps people coming back to grind but if its too easy it takes all the challenge (which there is little) from from the game
---
And as for the legendarys that they just nerfed, it just pisses people off when you kill 3* super mutant and get 1* assasins wood leg (im a little drunk so might be a little off point üòÅüòÅ) just wanted to get that out
---
I would pay for Nicks outfit. Would be pretty sweet
---
Google probably has them
---
oh i got it
---
You need to made some
---
I‚Äôm lvl 127 and the major gutsy still tears through my health like nothing
---
One is on the basement of Mountainside Bed and Breakfast, one in the top floor of th hardware store in Clarksburg and one in the Ranger District Office barn. I loved running a flaming twin blade chainsaw!
---
I fear Yao Guai more than DCs. Those bastards are nasty
---
There are no color mods except atom store paint jobs. Scrapping the first one I found out in the world was how I learned the plan to make it.
---
We need some wallpaper to really do it up
---
Whereabouts? Adding now
---
I managed to fix it, I'm currently at school but when I get home I'll tell you how
---
Underrated. Put in the hands of a balls to the walls bloodied build an executioners weapon is poweful indeed.
---
He‚Äôs at the water park btw.
---
Never died. My dude is lvl 220 beast mode. Two times it happened after I spawned in literally underneath her and had to back away so my explosive ammo didn't hurt.
---
Probably like three fiddy
---
Sweet. Thanks for doing this. I‚Äôve been go8 g crazy trying to get this damn camera.
---
- it is a nice day, isn't it?
---
**geiger counter clickin like crazy*
---
Above ground apparently. :D
---
It would be helpful to have a daily "post here if you have a realtime request about today" thread where anyone who was interested in getting others involved in something in-game could post the time/timezone, summary of the request, etc. It could include anything from nukes to people trying the game for the first time to roleplaying events and etc etc.
---
There is a combat armor helmet colour for every combat armor material colour!
---
&gt; Respec for me now requires more of a mindless grind because leveling is the only goal.
---
No it doesn't. What the fuck are you doing in the game? How do you play? When you log in what happens? Do you stand around decorating your base the whole time so you can't gain any xp? Then you don't need to respec. Oh you want a respec because you're killing monsters? Then it'll happen slowly and naturally. You're simply being impatient.
---
LMAO! Take my upvote! Outstanding idea!
---
Do English people call lines, queues?
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/J44vdBW
---
Yeah it's a missed opportunity on their part.  Would have been better to have included modular bars along with the one you get.  Ex: Long and short run counters (make one a full foundation length), corners  and end caps that all snap together smartly like file cabinets do.    
---
I currently have a makeshift counter and would like something nicer but I don't think these bars will fit the space: [https://imgur.com/a/LREEnAv](https://imgur.com/a/LREEnAv)   
---
Since you have the set.  Can you confirm that the signs are as lame as they are in the previews?  They look like placeholder art...
---
Jerks like that make events no fun.  Hopefully you will have much better experiences with voice chat in the future.  As long as people don't take themselves too seriously it can be fun.
---
Event, I believe. It drops as part of the reward.
---
Eh I don't think so. Your points come from a place that suggests that there's ultimately someone or a small group of people whom feel slighted and scornful making ambiguous decisions to "show us". There's really nothing I can say to you to convince you that there's really nothing like that going on, other than there's no profit in a company choosing to get emotionally invested like that. From what I gather you're in a situation similar to mine, with the whole "all hope is lost" mentality, and would recommend not sticking around the game or subreddit, as it will just further feed that unfortunate way of seeing things, making you all the more miserable in the process. Best of luck friend, cheers.
---
I don't need to grind for mods to make the game easier. Sorry that you suck so much at this game that you felt you had to do unfun bullshit for hours before you could start having fun.
---
I'll have to check when I get home, but they looked like cheap mirrors or something.
---
How fast can you kill a Col. Gutsy?
---
Ditto for an assaultron dominator?
---
I want to duel wield* FTFY
---
You youngin's have it easy!  Back in my day we teabagged that darn paper sack and spun around in circles while firing into the air.  Darn gift emotes!  /s
---
we need a tip fedora emote
---
I like how you did your bar. Is that a table on top of something?
---
Thank you sir!
---
Yup.  
---
*pops a radX and cracks a beer open*. 
---
Here ya go.  
---
*hands you a radX and a beer*. 
---
It‚Äôs allright.
---
I have grest gear but people eat duped stealthboys and use broken ass laser guns that tgey can keep repair kitting. And when i find them they camera tekeport 600 yards away and hide again. Ntm i cant even 1 hit melee an unarmored lv 5 with a 1k damage meathook because melee was quote unfair.
---
Why is having rocket turents bad? They are part of the game. Building them is not an exploit. You don't use them against other players unless they attacked you first. So what makes them bad?
---
Thank you! üòÅ
---
Or you can be like that guy that showed up when I was nearly done with Friedrich looking at a couple things he had and maybe 200 caps to get out of him. Dbag starts punching me and throwing grenades all around. He wanted me to hurry up I guess. Chat was glitched and muted, so I couldn't hear if he said anything. But I didn't have any junk on me, was set to pacifist, and there's a dozen vendors right down the hall. So instead of getting out of the way, I left the trade screen open and went outside to smoke then did a few chores around the house.
---
If he'd acted like you, he could have had that vendor in another 20 seconds. He decided to act like a child, so I tied it up for 20 minutes.
---
Yes, though I was thinking more of Boxing Gloves and Knuckles, since there's actually no issue on why it can't be wielded, both items do not block the pipboy when in use (and besides, all weapons disappear when using the pipboy, save for PA users). The idea for those weapons to allow them in higher tier usage would've been when dual-wielded, they will gain a 40% attack speed bonus. 
---
For PF, because of how the punching system is (pull back and slam out with a hesitation as the pistons shoot out the pad), I'd probably wouldn't place an attack speed bonus, or a very small one at the least.
---
They were literally shooting me
---
I found mine at Bolton Greens, lying in the fountain.
---
Made mine with that holotape request, camera registered bot litteraly when he sat on my face
---
Looks like a rockstar with long hair
---
They can be done solo, just know that there are a few areas where you‚Äôll be attacked by numerous enemies at once. You need to make sure to focus on any bigger threats, and then just focus on one enemy at a time while moving around a bit. You will definitely use a lot of healing items, and probably a decent amount of ammo as well, so make sure you‚Äôre stocked up.
---
I like it . But only on pve servers now
---
So what‚Äôs your ‚Äòsecret ‚Äò? Or are you full of shit? No offense.
---
If that‚Äôs ‚Äò16 tons‚Äô we‚Äôre on the same wavelength, brother.
---
I've done all mine solo, never been with a team in the silo.  I lost my virginity at about level 60, so you should be good.
---
I just want to use power fists with power armor. You could in the original game. In fact, you usually got power fists around the time you got power armor, but for some reason you can't in 76. It's silly.
---
Yeah it kind of annoyed me that it wouldn't let me vats the camera.
---
My favorite thing is that this is a response to how people are actually playing the game. Devs didnt forsee how god damned always we would be hooking each other up when they designed the game. Making it free is a pretty bad ass in the spirit of the emote move on beths part.
---
Mirelurks king.
---
This is what I did last night. I found I had to take a head-on photo for it to trigger the name tag to pop the achievement
---
Where exactly at the water park ?
---
It has typical fallout bugs. Having said that I enjoy the heck out of it. PS4 btw.
---
It's a no brainier at $20/less.
---
The first time you will do it, you will die a few times, mostly because you will get lost, get confused about the objectives , and run around in circle.
---
Once you've done one, they get "easier".
---
I have the same issue with the dailies.
---
Fortunately the Camden Park ones fixed themselves after a couple of weeks - I am so close now to having the full Mr Fuzzy set I can almost touch it :P - but the ones in The Mire... big nope.
---
However I don't think the devs have even acknowledged that there is an issue so I am not optimistic myself about the likelihood of a fix in the foreseeable future.
---

95% of my in-game interactions have been very positive (and I began the game with zero interest in interacting with other players, so that changed my mindset completely). However, I have definitely had a few griefing interactions too. They primarily occurred when I was low level and now on my new low level character and typically involve someone level 150-200+ two shotting me and then attempting to destroy my camp. I have a higher tolerance for this with workshops because in theory they were designed to encourage pvp, but it really irritates me when it's my camp. I'm one of those ridiculous people who spends way too much time building complex camps and trying to make them fun and easy for random players to discover, and I frequently have minimal or zero turrets and leave everything unlocked and etc. 
---
It didn't initially occur to me to bounce servers when I was new to the game because I wasn't very familiar with multiplayer games and server hopping. Now that I know about that trick it's less irritating, but it's still irritating. Apparently survival mode is not as thrilling as deliberately annoying people. And I feel bad for people who might be more sensitive to this than I am, and interested in Fallout but not interested in the pvp aspects... cuz I feel like if I was more sensitive, an interaction like that would discourage me from continuing to play. 
---
Thankfully there are also a lot of wonderful friendly players who have appeared to help defend me, give me valuable items for free, and invite me back to their camp to craft me things and etc. I've had entire teams of strangers "adopt" me and give me thousands of caps worth of weapons and supplies &amp; show me fun "easter egg" elements, and I wasn't even going out of my way to attempt to interact at the time. And I also love that they have ranged in age from 13 to 65, with a variety of genders/orientations &amp; political beliefs &amp; etc. It's pretty rad when a game can bridge what could be significant cultural divides.
---
That does work, however, for some reason those fusion cores have a tendency to disappear from your inventory. Noticed it myself and several friends did too. Weird.
---
Those are the codes to launch nukes. They expire every week.
---
They deserve it if they earned a bounty. Sometimes it can be a trap to lure players in so proceed with caution.
---
I mean they're predictably 900 some-odd caps from the production console in the bunker sooo..not exactly going to make you into an insta-millionaire.
---
If they kept them in the store you would spend all the atoms you have saved then would have to buy atoms for the next good item. This sales trick also deprives them of cash from new players who have not earned atoms yet but want the item now. The limited time item gimick is weak at best. Amazon is on of the most successful retailers ever. Why? Because they have just about anything you want. No limits
---
Thanks.  There is the defensive railing and behind it is two really low coffee tables and the rustic table is rug glitched on top.  There is some actual storage underneath as well with a metal crate and the small blue cooler.  It looks pretty jankey but I like how it fills the space.   The doors are the electric ones with offset opening.
---
Someone made a thread about using your perks and charisma to get the price down to around 1500 caps
---
I do the same thing, depending on what level they are... If they're under 20 and I'm on my main. I won't, persue cause they might not know what constitutes a bounty. But if they're above 50, maybe 40.. I'll punish them for what they should know they shouldn't be doing... 
---
So I think you're in the right, so long as you didn't take his junk after killing him.
---
I wish the plaid shirt and jeans was an outfit. Jeans and boots is what I'm after
---
Guests can drink from ift infinitely? or do you have to refill it when they drink it?
---
It's distracting you while you're trying to make sure you don't sell something by accident and it's stupid so the response is to make it take longer intentionally. When someone starts punching me while I'm in a vendor screen, I usually leave it open, set the controller down, and step away for 5-10 minutes. Act like a child and my response will be to discipline you like one.
---
I mean, if you didn't pay for the skins then it's $0.05/hour, which is a much better deal.
---
Groovy
---
I think so. They decrease the grind associated with routine play. I actually build up a supply of balistic fiber without looking for it. I don't have to go out looking for junk to make repairs cause I get what I need just by playing. 
---
I can actually enjoy the playing the game instead of getting tired of grinding for resources so I can grind for gear.
---
I haven't been able to finish these Challenges at all. I had a dozen clean pics, and nothing. I spawned a nuke card, and took many pics. Then another time a random encounter with the Vertibots, and nothing. I've tried aiming to camera. Tried zooming. Shot them down and tried taking pics of the wreckage, but not once did it register. So I gave up because that's just FO76.
---
Jesus christ, I can‚Äôt remeber the last time I saw someone intelligent enough to use google. It seems 99% of people have absolutely no idea such a site exists
---
I just checked, it's on the internal.. I unplugged by external to see if that helps.
---
The workshop nerfs have pretty much reduced their function and Bethesda really needs to consider how workshops are non factors now for the game.  Early game prior to the nerfs people would actually care about their workshops.
---
We have no details yet, nothing datamined of it.
---
All from Bethesda or data mined images thus far
---
But thank you for your input.
---
Junk deposits
---
I run an Executioner‚Äôs Lever Rifle on a Sneak/Sniper build. The first shot is usually a sneak or sneak crit, which def puts the mob low enough for the Legendary effect to do the rest.
---
What's too many? I usually delete some when I get too close to 300..
---
its called Fear Of Missing Out. it's a psychological thing. It would be different if they werent limited time items, meaning if you decide you want to wear a different one down the road you can't unless you buy them all now. it's very psychologically manipulative.
---
So long as they get put on their own servers so that we don't get a bunch of level 5 assholes attacking us while bunny-hopping around screaming into their headset...
---
436 and a half.
---
I'm down. I'm only level 51. I probably won't be on tonight. But usually play late afternoon/night after my son goes to bed. Riggyriggs28, feel free anyone else as well.
---
I have for fun. But I hover around the junk they drop so they don't lose it.
---
It was around 11:30 pm GMT+2 but it was not a first time this happened. Like week ago same thing happened to me during defence of fort Defiance
---
You have to refill it. It has a capacity of 10 drinks.
---
You say true, I say thankya.
---
Pacifist mode. At least for vending. When some idiot starts throwing grenades or punching you, leave the vendor open and walk away for a bit. Screw those idiots.
---
There are no plans for X-01. You will need 2 of the calibrated shocks mods.
---
I think this is gonna be part of the pioneer scouts quest spot but who knows
---
They are a bit intimidating when you dont know the game well, once you learn the game, they become a joke
---
Only mods for X-01.
---
I am curious given you can‚Äôt pvp how does the bounty actually work, is it if you take someone‚Äôs workshop or what?
---
They weren‚Äôt called the hatchet gang though...
---
If ur wanted you deserve to die loll #getthatbounty
---
From the little I've heard..
---
He'll give you some form of "credit" for every legendary you give him. In which you can save up for other legendaries he'll have in his stock.
---
(That's what i last heard - it may have changed)
---
Herpes
---
I use T-60 cal shocks legs for my daily use power armor (X-01 jet torso and helmet). T-60 is way cheaper to repair if you wear power armor all the time.
---
Pipboy is in the way so we'll have to turn that into a power fist.
---
It's not forced, you could play adventure
---
I may have been... less than eloquent because that wasn't my point at all.
---
There is no 'teaching lessons' or 'scorn' implicit in my post(s).
---
There was an issue, and by suspending those accounts without recourse the issue was resolved. That is it. I sincerely doubt that they give this matter any thought.
---
Is my educated guess that they instructed whoever handles their first contact to ignore any tickets regarding this matter and excluded them from their SLA metrics.
---
Then they moved on. That's it.
---
Whoa calm down dude. I‚Äôve earned ever perk point I‚Äôm ever gonna get. I‚Äôm just talking about moving them around. If Im level 90 or something and I‚Äôve been playing a luck and endurance build then decide I wanna try out stealth melee build I would have to level up close to thirty times to move those points I have into those perk trees. I‚Äôm not talking about the cards. Obviously you gotta earn what you get but the points I already have. I just don‚Äôt wanna spend that much time just to move them.  Try having a discussion before devolving into speculation and outrage. You‚Äôll sound smarter.

Happy cake day :)

I really don't see what any of this has to do with her outfit. I like it, it looks cute.

I always keep mine less than 100 but as long as you have 150 or less you should be good
---
Sheepsquatch, The Burrows, a camera, ???
---
What am I missing. I have 300+ hours in the game by this point, y'all need to stop defending the fact that there are still bugs and glitches from the beta.
---
the Bloodied build PVP players fear the Executioner's prefix, they also fear gamma guns, due to their health pools being so small. spec into a pistol build it and it could be good.. but then again, i do not do PVP.
---
I've never used it in pvp but I can totally see how it would bring an advantage, but with a stroke of bad luck you could make your opponent a beefed up mutie
---
You're getting downvotes but you're finally saying what I keep trying to tell people. FOMO abuse is gross.
---
Take over a workshop. Make sure your wanted when you do this. Helps bring in a bunch of great people that can help you out.
---
Is it a one per person deal?
---
Found a 3 star behemoth, killed it, tried to loot it nothing came up, so I Shot it with bloody mess to break it up and hopefully drop something.
---
The headless corpse stood up on its own two feet and ran into the ground escaping.
---
Bethesda hates me.
---
Actually yeah. I was trying to think what really makes me worry at this point in my characters life. It's not high level gutsy, or yao gai, or deathclaw. It's those damn crickets. Getting surrounded by a swarm is almost certain death, and they must be part berry mentat cause stealth is almost useless.
---
I take all and give it to needier players.
---
Toxic goo looted from West Tec xD
---
Association. I dislike the character, seeing the outfit reminds me of the character, feeds into a continuous loop.
---
Bugger... I hope your wrong.

There have been 8 patches with pages full of changes. You just have your mind made up and disregard whatever doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative.

 Better thumbs up then a heart with your hands. Awkward
---
If you're able to be hit while playing ranged you're not playing it effectively. Ranged builds Merc on survival because if I shoot you repeatedly in the head with my rifle you won't make it to melee Range. Both are good. Melee is good in areas like buildings where range is negated. It however is not nearly as good against a player who has learned to position themselves effectively
---
No, you can put up to 10 drinks in it. Each time someone "drinks" from it, it takes a drink out.
---
Finally! It would also be cool to add a choice to turn the paper bag into a present ;).
---
In my eyes, most people with a 5 cap bounty don't deserve it, because the system can be broken at times. For example I picked a lock outside a workshop's zone, that was unclaimed btw and still got a small bounty. Accidentally hitting cars with shotguns near camps can cause a small bounty too. So unless they have a huge bounty, Ill ignore them unless they want me to get rid of it for them.
---
Noo..you could have gotten that wooden armor piece.
---
I could activate it, killed the scorchbeast and ground troops and had 3 and a half minutes to go and it failed. I have no idea why. Everything was dead.
---
I prefer the interface of this game to other games. It makes sense to me. I don't hotkey any health items. All it takes is learning that things are alphabetical and misc has been split
---
Doesn't swing speed only affect power attacks on automatic melee weapons?
---
They didn‚Äôt get them in game yet
---
They used a code mesh overlay to apply it‚Äôs graphic model to different power armors for screen shots
---
It's too early for tryhard trolls. Go on, back to your xbox now.
---
Makes me wonder how long it takes some people to buy/sell from the vendors... seen people spend 5-10 minutes (or more) with the vendor... why? How long does it take you to decide what to sell/buy?
---
It's true. I saw a legendary sheepsquatch tanking 2 scorchbeast, so I decided to take out the SB then get the Squatch, but 2 lvl 68 super mutants cut it down before I could get the tag! So disappointing. Next time, less finesse, and more disembowling.
---
&gt;You just have your mind made up and disregard whatever doesn‚Äôt fit your narrative.
---
Nah dude if you think Fallout76 has had massive changes then you literally do not play any other game. I've put more than enough time into this game to have a smart opinion about what Bethesda has been doing to its playerbase.
---
Get your head out of your ass and realize 8 patches in a half year time **is not fucking good by any means**
---
I‚Äôm running a heavy/PA build with various TSE weapons. Mainly a TSE minigun doing ~140dmg/shot. Absolutely destroys everything, a goatsquatch lasts 10 seconds.
---
Slap an accelerated barrel on it and you‚Äôre firing ~29 shots per second. 140x29=4060dmg/sec. (243,600dmg/min)
---
Make sure to use stabilized which negates 45% enemy armor when using heavy weapons and PA.
---
I also use a TSE harpoon gun which one-shots most things(912 dmg/shot), and with flechettes you have unlimited ammo which is nice.
---
I have a TSE .50 cal collecting dust in my stash but that could be pretty devastating aswell. Reason I chose the minigun over the .50 cal is because with bandolier, 5mm ammo becomes entirely weightless, so you can hoard as much ammo as you can find with no weight penalty.
---
Dual tse minigun
---
It‚Äôs a brand new account. This is a bit weird.
---
Dont shoot her while she's in the air, for some odd reason she drops more. Get the enforcer perk and bring a shotgun, shoot the wings maybe 4 times, then proceed to use a heavy weapon (preferably anti-armor or explosive) and shoot her in the head. Repeat this cycle with a team.
---
Thanks for the tips! Need so much acid...
---
Eh, idk. I just know what I sold.
---
So I am not the best at using reddit.  Saw my first sheep sasquatch today and I killed it all by myself.  Yea!!  The thing is I've been helping my husband with his new character, he deleted his 1st one.  So I am getting him the locations he already had.  Guess who's character I was using when I shot the sheep sasquatch.  Damn it, he will get all the credit...  lmao!!  Oh well next time.  PS. I was at Braxtons Medical.
---
Hmm... I've scrapped a lot since unlocking the plan but never had a material color unlock.
---
There‚Äôs a line of toy cars inside Grafton Dam
---
I was able to use Paypal this morning and it went through but when Paypal had the screen to go back to merchant, Bethesda  would cancel my order but really the order did go through.
---
Seems we got the opposite, I only got the material colours but not the helmet, and visa versa!
---
I‚Äôd be down as long as while aiming it just tightened the spread

Disease Mirelurk hatchlings. Highland marsh has two mirelurk nests that are good for that.
---
The Lode Baring event in the Ash Heap is a good way to get Nuclear Material.
---
There are green footlockers around the mine that contain refined ore scrap, including Nuclear Material. They can have between 2-12 Nuclear Material, though 4-8 is more common in my experience, and there's four or five lockers in the mine.
---
For reference, HZ-21 produces 30 Uranium Ore every 30 minutes which, with 30 acid, is refined into 12 nuclear material.
---
Doing Lode Baring one time will likely give you at least double that, plus there are Uranium nodes in the mine you can collect as well, although a lot of mining nodes are bugged in this event and can't be harvested.
---
Yeah, for about a minute I thought I had made a new friend. *Sigh*
---
Dude dual wielding gauntlets in Excavator: mole miner king
---
that disease one seems kinda op, and the stash one may break servers if everyone runs it (which they will).
---
It might be great to have your platform and your tag on the post.
---
Else, it just sounds as a shady, creepy IRL invitarion.
---
It‚Äôs all fun and games til you lose a bunch of your fingers to a Mirelurk.
---
Yeah but they look the same. If they looked smaller and less vicious it would make sense but yeah...
---
Is that coming?
---
**What massive changes , going "oh there's been eight patches" in half a year is not only terrible but it's also not an argument**
---
I've had that happen once and the truly innocent will walk straight up to you wanting to get rid of the bounty.
---
Yeah, I have to find it here on fo76
---
OMG YES, I do remember finding that! Romeo and Juliet syndrome....
---
Ooohhh, I forget about those doors. I'll have to play with them.  I had the defense railing in front of my old bar but it seemed too high for the stools. Maybe I'll check that out again.
---
Im trying to work out why mine doesn't appear after I got it from the atomic store
---
Like are you on Xbox, PS4, PC?
---
Me too
---
My bloodied setup has yet to find a match against power armor. You can also do a mix bloodied/bolstering build. Depending if you‚Äôre ranged or not, it‚Äôs relatively simple. Some can use chameleon and go for headshots. There‚Äôs tons of different builds out there that people use that put power armor as sub par. The only thing that I haven‚Äôt been able to do is match the radiation resist.
---
The fact that there‚Äôs so many options with regular armor, it kind of kills the mood for me and power armor. Yes power armor gets mods in which some of them are decent but it‚Äôs still not the best choice in my opinion. You can take the queen for example. I have yet to see someone other than a heavy build in power armor that can even scratch the queen. Vs you see tons of regular armor knocking chunks out. The time to down the queen is no match to someone who is properly built in regular armor. That‚Äôs why more times than not, you see those poorly placed nukes take so long, if not fail. 
---
Again, it‚Äôs my opinion and observations. Power armor can be ok but it really seems like for end game content, it‚Äôs subpar to the rest. I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôd ever pvp in it. My main can carry just as much as power armor and has the same defense as power armor, excluding radiation resist. But I still dish out a lot more dps with my main vs. power armor.
---
I‚Äôm not OP
---
Huh I could see Somone spamming it to be a jerk but I hope not
---
I could definitely see that being the case in terms of efficently and swiftly dealing with the matter, while keeping their options open. But you'd think that they'd see that potential stream of revenue, that they are cutting off by not letting users have access to their suspended accounts, and would rathe rit continue. I could be wrong, but I doubt the statistics would indicate that banned people will rebuy the games, hell I'd wager it would put more hesitation on them buying their games in the future if anything. It's very obscure that's for sure.
---
Lol I see what kind of person I‚Äôm dealing with now. Sorry thought this could be a real discussion,
---
If they don‚Äôt have a date they shouldn‚Äôt be getting removed anytime soon.
---
Lol? There was no outrage. You're entitled, I don't have to be upset or outraged for that to be true. I'm absolutely calm, what do I have to be in a rage over? You said some silly very entitled things, I asked you why you think that way and showed you how you're behaving like a child. None of that was speculation, it was exploring different scenarios, all of which essentially make your point invalid. Why are you jumping to insults after someone shut down your argument? You should keep the conversation about the subject at hand, you'll sound smarter.
---
You probably had a storage bottleneck. I can't even tell when shadowplay is on - it's very lightweight compared to old fashioned recording software such as FRAPS.
---
Tried joining your session but showing you as offline in game even though psn shows you as online.  Thanks anyways.
---
Hmmmmm true, didn‚Äôt realise that
---
Haha, I sneak a lot, so I'd notice the \[Detected\] if I got one and look for your dot.
---
No need for this or asking what prices are. Waste of time.
---
Lol k
---
Preach! üôå
---
Okay so then continue pretending you're playing a great game. Sorry that you don't have an excuse for eight patches in a half years time. 
---
Go right ahead and notice how I literally didn't once shit talk the game in it's current state and only pointed out that other games have done much more in the time allotted. I've spent more than enough time in this game to know it is not that good and a lot of the hate was deserved. So what's your excuse for still defending it?
---
I will follow you into battle anyday.
---
XB1 but thanks for the info I'll mess around with them and see if I can make something work

That sounds familiar. Was your camp just north of the WS Country Club on Xbox? 
---
I‚Äôm not normally one for PvP, let alone griefing. But last week a player got me killed while I was sneaking about farming radaway. I realize accidents happen and I normally don‚Äôt care about dying (especially as sneak hides you on the map). 
---
But after getting me killed the jerk stole my hobo bag - with a nice stack of ballistic and plastic along with it.  So, I tailed them back to their base and lit that baby up like the 4th of July. 
---
Just as you said, I had ~10% hp, started with the water purifiers, chopped through a bunch of benches and other items, dropped a grenade, and dipped out. The whole attack maybe took 30 seconds. 
---
Sorry if that was you. In retrospect, it was a pretty immature response to the situation. But I won‚Äôt lie, it felt good to dole out a little wasteland justice for a change.
---
Your lips are green. You might want to slow down on that Nukashine man, you don‚Äôt look so well.
---
Agreed.  Cool underarmor skins are pointless.
---
Now, hear me out on this...
---
Dual Fat Men.
---
Good luck!
---
It's like a drinking fountain. You walk up and "take a drink" but you don't k ow what you're drinking.
---
no arena zone with que to fight / view area for gamblin , update yet ? wats wrong with the devs
---
Time to try the free range event!
---
I took one into survival just to test it out. First person I came across was a bloodied dcg guy who came charging at me. Bet they felt stupid when the first shot hit and annihilated them. They're not the most accurate of things but they will cause serious bother when they do hit.
---
... So, they paid someone to create an in-game asset for a couple screenshots and then shelved it because there is some reason not to sell things in the atom shop or barring that make it a new lootable in-game? Why?
---
Feel you. No idea what they shoot but I need two boxes of it
---
The vault tec paint in the closest to this. It comes in a bundle and has metal, combat and leather paints that are a little different but still matches together. It‚Äôs actually pretty cool. The pip boy paint makes it less important what your left arm is arm.
---
I‚Äôm hoping they will release more bundles for normal armor.
---
Upvoting this so its gettin hot :x
---
War Rider is cool, but it's not the best if they apply the same appearance regardless of the PA type you're actually wearing.
---
They did the same thing as with Plague Warrior.
---
Your Excavator armor turns into X-01.  That's just lazy.
---
For it to be worthy of "best skin ever", each individual PA type would need to be reflected properly.
---
Lol are you on Xbox and in the level 55 range? That was the only guy that killed me like 3~4 times
---
[](/sweetcelestia)Dual two shot mirv fat men... aaaand the frames? They are long gone.
---
Because it‚Äôs funny and I was bored.
---
The dreaded 3 claw swipe combo they do is vicious.. my gf had one guard her base and it was a low level. It killed EVERYTHING. Only thing it couldn't take on was ranged mutants bullets. RIP Pooh (the name she gave it)
---
Gotcha!
---
On Xbox, but no, I'm quite a bit north of there. My wife and I had come back from I think a burrows run and had been at the camp for a few minutes breaking shit down and cooking when the attack happened.
