Primm slim is the way to go
---
---
---
Yea I‚Äôm one of those people with a trash looking camp...
---

---
I want the camp too be as functional as possible tho and I use the junk from my junk extractor too much.
---
Is that... The ark poop?
---
Curious, I just started recently but how long did it take you to get so much ammo?
---
Is 60 sufficient again ghouls?
---
You can already block. Try it. Nobody does. 
---
Better yet, get a reflect damage weapon and watch those million damage bloodied builds ace themselves. Nobody expects that ever. Its hilarious
---
You could've probably got something pretty good for that dude.
---
Cool. I can listen. Just maybe message me,

You can check your personal terminal, and it'll tell you when the robots are ready to meet
---
How much are you carrying?
---
Normally it's the nuclear material and some aluminum that the workshop is low on.  Jump to a town with lots of interiors like Helvetia/Sutton  (close enough together to bundle) and look for all the blast radius board games, alarm clocks, flip lighters, and toasters.  A run through just those two towns should have you set up on nuclear material for a while.
---
Aluminum shouldn't be too crazy - just never bulk and sell it, and grab every item with aluminum, however minor.
---
To get used to that hunt, go into your pipboy and clear all of your tagged search items.  Tag only aluminum and nuclear material on your next couple runs and look at everything.  You'll find patterns - when they put one thing in the game there tends to be a certain range of other items close by.
---
Ah cool, thanks. I forgot all about that thing.
---
I should be able to pick up mutilated hands and use them to clap in fo76
---
It depends. Sometimes I'm underweight, sometimes over.. Sometimes in power armor (one of 4 or 5 different sets), and sometimes just regular armor. I can't make any kind of sense out of it. There's no recognizable pattern to it.
---
Does the no stacked crit damage effects in pvp also apply to weapon mods?
---
It's so bad, people are actually gonna buy it, trust me
---
"Welcome back sir or maaaaaaaam."
---
üò±
---
Though to be fair, you did build that pretty sturdy. I only had the red wood paneled home kit by the time I set that camp so it wasn‚Äôt as reinforced as your is. 
---
Nice job!
---
Damn autocorrect, meant to say we don't use mics anyways.
---
Does it vary by carrying weight? this happens to me. Actually almost every time. I have 400 / 550 as my carry weight
---
It feels like they were.
---
I can't really hate on the +DR my furious Gatling has. Makes me feel tankish.
---
i have, 2-3 whitesprings utility protectron, 1 assaultron, 1 sentry bot, 1 gutsy in my camp since i build near a whitesprings wall and they spawn there.
---
When i comeback to the camp they are getting destroyed by any mob, ghouls, snallygaster, deathclaw, behemont, supermutant, mongrels, they can only fight molerats 
---
so they are pretty useless they need some changes to be part of someone camp because there is no fun in repair broken robots
---
Wasn't sure because I've managed my carrying weight pretty well since they bumped up the storage. I use to have the issue alot. I think its because you may be carrying too much when you die so you cant really fast travel anywhere
---
I've put the crit damage reciever on my handmade with 50% crit, and was dealing the same damage. It goes back to the fact there's a maximum damage per shot possible in PvP. Additionally crits ignore all armor effects in case you didn't know.
---
it can very rarely drop plans for power armor limbs
---
I'm sorry to tell you this, but if you need 10k ammo for a queen fight or think that 50% isn't already a significant boost to automatic weapons, you either have an awful build or don't understand how MMOs work
---
I hope so, I‚Äôm holding it just incase, it weighs nothing anyway haha.
---
You may just be carrying too much so it wont let you travel far
---
I've done 15 odd monster mashes. I've only had it turn PVP...twice?
---
That's actually pretty logical. I think I'm going to get overweight and go commit die. Will be back with results.
---
PLEASE. 
---
Even if it‚Äôs technically just a stationary one that floats in place and greets you when you return I would be happy
---
Well, I got this from another data miner, but there should also be a similar one for rad resist. Basically each piece adds to that reduction. So at 6 pieces, that 7% becomes 42% (the rad resist number is closer to 12% per piece, IIRC). 
---
I cant speak to inconsistencies in it though; I haven‚Äôt noticed any. I can tank ghouls all day long; it‚Äôs the imposter sheepsquatch and yao guai who get me (their charge attack hits hard and stuns... even if the first hit doesn‚Äôt kill, the next ones will because I‚Äôm staggered). 
---
PvP is a different beast, I make no claims towards it (but pvpers also were combining cav/sent with assassin, and yeah, stacking both is a clear advantage in PVP. Plus emergency protocols only works at low health; not safe in PVP). 
---
You can do all right out of PA with a heavy weapon; this game is easy enough for that. But for combat efficiency? You can‚Äôt beat PA for HW in combat. The armor piercing alone is what, a 25% damage increase? There‚Äôs nothing in regular armor that will give you a damage increase. 
---
Add in the accuracy bonus (situational, but still) and it‚Äôs no question that for actual combat performance, PA+HW. There‚Äôs a reason I say Stabilized is a keystone perk.
---
Agreed, this was indeed a fun read.
---
Lol. No prob
---
My camp looks utterly horrible but it's glitched and I can't delete any floors to redo it and since it's ugly but functional I haven't wanted life my camp to start from scratch
---
üëç
---
Scum !
---
Pretty sure it's on the 20 hour timer. I play at different times each night but it's always reset when I get on.
---
They rarely spawn anymore your better off grabbing a power plant and loading up on a few takes as much time running around and you can grab some other stuff while you wait my only solution
---
For record I used to just drown in them I felt. Then they ramped up the burn rate, increased the chance you get diseases outside of pa, and made it so unless you have a optimal dmg resist build you have to be in pa
---
True, but like, I have a couple 1 stars that I love (bloodied handmade, bloody combat shotgun) and I had a great 2 star pistol, now I have an epic 3 star pistol. 
---
Why not go for the moon if what you have is good enough?
---
Get better internet. Quit blaming the game for your faults. TLDR: IT SMELLS LIKE BROKE IN HERE
---
Depends. Atomics challenge wants 50 kills with a fatman. I just happened to have the mats required to make a shit ton for the challenge. I may have preferred to buy a few, but yeah wouldn't have been 20 caps.
---
Sales... Sales never changes....
---
I think that is a step above some of the stuff I got from the vendor, think that but softer
---
Hey! Some of us still take pride in a well-groomed appearance as we wade through several metric tons of irradiated gore all in the name of *"SCIENCE!"*
---
Uranium Fever 3* for me have been happening like 9/10 times.
---
I'd trade my bloodied explosive combat rifle for a bloodied +50% crit combat rifle or handmade all day long.
---
I did the same when I moved my CAMP yesterday (and am hoping that testing the spawn in helps as it did for you =).
---
Yeah, I am another advocate for getting those fast travel mats.  I know some people were using them to trap/kill players, but I don't think that was the main reason they were removed (and despite those who say its a risk, I don't see how the current system doesn't have the same potential issue).  I also feel that such behavior is minimal (I'd be more inclined to worry about a random team invite than fast travelling to a camp).
---
I'm with you on not feeling its ill intent, and would even say it goes a bit beyong just not planning for vending (most people wouldn't consider that where they spawn in may not be the same place other people will for example).  Hopefully we got some good solutions to improve that soon (I want to hope for next week, but I know better than to actually expect that =).
---
I mean, nothing against those who _would_ pay 10K plus for a gun. Some are worth it. But personally that's to rich for my blood. I have other things I'd rather spend money on.
---
If it‚Äôs in your vending machine 1:1 is really all you can do. People sell in bulk for less, but that can be a hassle. I‚Äôve seen people trying to sell for 2-5 caps, no way that‚Äôll ever move. 
---
I burn through 45, 556 and fusion cells so I‚Äôm happy to buy them 1:1 when I see them, but any more than that is a big jump when you‚Äôre buying 1k+ at a time.
---
If you're picking everything up and only using one or two types of ammo, you stack them up real quick. I've been starting to have to just drop some ammo because I can't even sell enough at a cap each.
---
explosive ammo can charge more, but most people never use them. i STILL see them get abandoned from time to time. good for me since i use them if they are free
---
"It's a feature, not a bug," is Bethesda's unofficial motto.
---
Exactly. It's another way to get rid of crap 1 star items. I honestly wish they had _something_ say sub-level 50 1 stars, which were worth 2 and 1 scrip, to round out days.
---
Unless it isn't...(see also wood armor and/or assaultron head).
---
...Yeah no you're just expecting way to much way to early. The curve starts way later, and continues way longer in this game, that's all.

Could have a dirty clean system, doesnt do much, but you get some bonuses if you clean yourself every so often.

And/or add an additional function to the Flare Gun. Make it so it scares certain enemies in the game, like wolves or Deathclaws.

I have a (sometimes Legendary) Behemoth named Dave that protects my camp. He lives in my pond and comes out to greet fast travelers and pummel my razorgrain. Occasionally he offers cheap 1* legendary gifts. Once in a great while he coughs up a nice 3* weapon that I feel bad shooting his next incarnation with. Until he pummels my razorgrain, and then it's "thanks for the Vampire's Plasma Gat, swollen green asshole!"
---
Okay
---
What I don‚Äôt get is you can squeeze all the functionality needed in a 2x4. Why are these giant ugly boxes 6x6?! It‚Äôs not functional anymore! You‚Äôve gotta fun for like 2 minutes to get from one side of your giant floating warehouse to the other. Bleh.

Classic Grahm.

Yeah...that's not it.
---
I do PvP and more often than not I have to use same AP pool for dodgy and for vats. Accuracy increases with each my shot due to concentraded fire. I'm not saying your path is wrong. There are just many different ones.

---
Could be a problem on your end.  I play on XBox One for about two hours every night.  It's been a week or so since I've had a server disconnect.
---
West Tek the best place to farm legendaries? Sorry if it‚Äôs an obvious question still trying to figure it out myself üòÖ
---
It only quads the standard mag.
---
If it's my end, then it's the internet on the west cost. I play with someone else in a neighbouring state, usually when I disconnect so do they. Plus the couple other games I play never seem to have a disconnect problem.
---
I want the boxy thing from fo4 that lets you send an eyebot out scouting for junk/ammo/love/whatever.
---
That's what I was thinking. It would be a good way to clean up after doing some task.
---
I stopped playing 76 in 18 and even I wonder why Beth hasn't done this yet.  Its genius!
---
The only bad thing in this post is that junkies and berserker were ommited. Rest are a rare sight -a good balance suggestions from the community.
---
8 shots mag x 4 = 32 for quad. Drum mag adds 4 for 36.
---
I'm always surprised when NO ONE ever shows up for AWOL Armaments.  I am always watching for it to pop up.  Worst case, you get 1 max level legendary.  But at least half of the times I've done the quest, 2 3* legendaries have spawned.  
---
It's a great quest for robot scrap, XP, and legendaries.  What more could you want?
---
that‚Äôs the beauty of wood lol
---
Yeah, but hopefully a fix will come down for that. At least it isn't removing the stars from everything. Its still a guarantee (purveyor) versus a chance (3* enemy).
---
I think there should be a perk card similar to serendipity that gives you dodge chance for each armor piece slot you have empty. Berserker lacks synergies that would make it valid. Bloodied is perfect example on how it should be done.
---
Hey you on 76? And have a plasma grenade plan I can get?
---
Yeah same for me actually. Thanks for closing that part. 
---
Well I‚Äôm good on caps. So I would be happy to spend athe double if needed haha. Been using the drifter outfit since day one. I like the more immersive outfits in the game
---
Fact that none of my other games dont disco, I'm still connected to the internet, Xbox live works. Any number of things.
---
There is no such thing. Duping has devastated this game's player economy beyond repair.
---
I view her like buying scratch off lottery tickets at the corner store... probably a waste of time but it's fun imagining I might win for the few minutes til resignation sets in.
---
Those have plans? Didn‚Äôt know
---
I still Adhesive farm (tato/mutfruit/corn), bulk those bad boys up and sell em.
---
Why not just play the game and follow the rules?
---
I can attach the beam focuser for you....for a price.
---
So clearly you didn‚Äôt see what I had said did you?
---
There is a fusion core in Camden Park as well.
---
It is the most powerful now
---
I did. That‚Äôs my opinion on breaking the rules. I mean on ‚Äúharmless duping.‚Äù
---
especially with demo expert
---
Please please please
---
Ah, fair enough
---
Yes, pleeeaaaase. Recently came back to the game and some of my new armor has cloaking stuff. It's been driving me up the wall that I don't have sights. I can't count how many times I \*thought\* I was aiming in the right spot and \*suddenly\*...
---
OP, this happens a to me a lot and it wasn‚Äôt until I read this it even occurred to me that it would be weight related. 
---
I‚Äôm typically encumbered, fighting to drop weight after a White Springs or Blackwater run.
---
Makes so much sense, I feel dumb as hell for not thinking of it earlier.
---
IMO you need power armor to get the most from heavy guns.  The stabilized perk ignores 45 percent of your target's armor and requires power armor.  Without out it heavy weapons lose considerable amount of punch. I'm a heavy weapons build and this is my setup. Thinking about moving some points around for a few more points in luck but haven't officially decided yet.

A very touching post from ... Anus Hammer
---
There‚Äôs really not a ‚Äúbest‚Äù specific place, more like a circuit. West Tek is part of that circuit. General‚Äôs steakhouse, Robco, the Whitespring, Huntersville (sometimes), the satellite just north of West Tek. The less fast travel the better.
---
I had stabilized in there. But I agree that was the reason for taking that perk
---
Mothman is within us all br√∂ther
---
I don‚Äôt know about others but it feels like a 3 star dropping from a 3 star is more common. Ain‚Äôt complainin!
---
I use mine to make a bunch of radaway as it's an easy thing to make and having the extra purifiers makes it faster to craft a bulk amount
---
Nuked Whitesprings, Nuked Burrows, regular WS, West Tek, sugar grove
---
One bug that‚Äôs useful? Seems like you just like complaining.
---
My mistake. Don't know how I overlooked that.. I maxed out my intelligence so I could add power user (slow fusion core drain) and power patcher. I keep power patcher on always to slow power armor from breaking. Power user lets me spend most of my time in power armor without running out of juice.
---
This.
---
Very nice, very funny. 
---
Did you happen to get the fixer plan? I wish it would at least spawn correctly leveled from the quest.
---
Here's the ones that have been not working for me:
---
**Photography** (Possum)
---
* I haven't been able to get a cargobot pic to register. Tried the regular cargobot summoned by a government care package holotape, another one that spontaneously dropped a care package near me (and no it wasn't somebody else's that I stole), and the one escorted by Vertibots that carries the nuke card. None of them will register in the upper right corner of the camera and taking pics aren't counting against the challenge. The only one I haven't tried is the one from the low-level quest at Morgantown Airport. Tried all the others at various altitudes and distances, and zoom levels on the camera.
---
**Music** (Possum)
---
* Play (instrument) ain't working for me for any of the instruments (acoustic guitar, bass, wind, drums), and no matter where I try them.
---
**Chemist** (Possum)
---
* Shoot Yao Guai with Syringer did not register for me, admittedly it was a Glowing Rabid (or Angry or Bewildered or something-ed) Yao Guai at one of the Whitesprings gates - maybe it needs to be a plain vanilla bear?
---
I‚Äôve only had it happen 1 time and I‚Äôve prob ran it 25+ times
---
 üòÑ
---
Shhh, don't let Bethesda know
---
No worries and thank you for the advice. I know there isn't really one set build that is the perfect build but all input is appreciated
---
How could I forget rule #1!
---
The opposite happened to me last night, i spawned into someone's camp to see what they have for sale and out of nowhere 4 schorched beast pop up with their mobs along with the flatwoods monster we fight them off for a bit and in the middle of the fight the camp owner logs out, totally understandable as they did not want their camp wrecked.

Well if you have the mod and can do this what would you charge me?

Buddy??? I'm literally just asking why this idea of introducing non cosmetic microtransactions has suddenly become so tolerable. Guess I have my answer considering how nasty you got over me asking a simple question but whatever I guess?
---
If you cycle through the lights tab on your build menu, you'll eventually find one called "rotating lights," which looks like a bare, brown-ish bulb hanging from a wire. They're a bit finicky: Unlike normal lights, they have to each individually be connected to a power source by a wire, rather than just being near to a power connector. Once you've got them turned on, you can interact with them manually (hitting the X button on PS4, for instance), to get them to change colour. Or if you have a terminal set up in your CAMP, you can use it to change the colour of all of the lights of that type at once.

I've gotten the Super Stim recipe from Countdowns twice now, having played since b.e.t.a.
---
Honestly, I feel you're underrating Uranium Fever. It's great to farm steel and shotgun shells from (unless it breaks and doesn't spawn shit). Three guaranteed legends is nothing to scoff at. The cap of lvl 40 sucks, I've had good rolls from this event ruined by a low roll on the item level. But they do have the potential to drop max level loot. The addition of Murmgh, in my opinion, makes this event infinitely more valuable as well. A shot at up to 120 scrip in tend minutes is worth it to me, granted that is the dream scenario.
---
I think people sleep on Guided Meditation. I don't do it often because its so out of the way that i just don't see it, and also the voice creeps me out. It lacks the guaranteed stars of UF, but it kicks the shit out of UF for steel, and you get rifle ammo instead of shell if that's what you're looking for. (assuming, like UF, it doesn't break and stop spawning shit after a wave or two)

Thank you. I imagine that u/Nkdu's heart was in the right place, but yeah, something like 30% of the comments I leave on Reddit are decrying white supremacists in one form or another, and that's something which you'll consistently find, going back years and years through my post history. I'm not particularly upset by the accusation, though I do wish that it was a bit less... impulsive?
---
I second this let me know ur price lol
---
And that's completely understandable and I respect that, I'm just mainly confused on the idea that this whole sub is pretty much 100% okay with paying for some overcharged cosmetics. I'm generalizing of course, but it still weirds me out a bit. Guess I'm still stuck in "back in my day" kind of garbage, feels bad gamers

I have a base which the location I will not disclose. But it is indestructible. I have the shop inside of it. The only way to get to the shop is by teleporting inside. (No it's not in a cliff, hill, etc.) So if you teleport in on pve you can access the shop.. 
---
As for pvp... If you teleport in, the ONLY room someone can get into without building privileges, is the shop room.. full of turrets.. so people die instantly. Plus with the recent update making bases immortal, it's the best farm/trap base ever. 
---
Because let's face it.. no one teleports to someone's camp in pvp to "buy stuff". Especially when I'm always #1 on the server. They come to kill me, and instead give me free stuff.
---
TLDR: I have a trap base for pvp and stay ranked #1 so only those who come to do me harm get killed.
---
Alright. Thank you for the great deals. Best weapons I've seen at anyone's vendor.

It worked!!!!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH

I‚Äôve gotten two Bomber Jackets and one clean Army Fatigues from Forbidden Knowledge, but not much else that I can recall off the top of my head.
---
It‚Äôs a to-do item for sure to categorize the drop types and make it a bit easier to say, for instance, ‚Äúthese events are more likely to give ammo than recipes‚Äù. But it‚Äôll also be a lot of work lol
---
Let‚Äôs compare real life guns to video games... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Just a little addition back down to reality, it doesn't work on everything. Afaik it won't work on bulking junk, brewing alcohol, or additional perks. It only doubles the base amount. For example, if you have chemist (which doubles all chems you create) and make 4x diluted stimpaks, a super duper proc will only give you 2x additional diluted stims, not 4x, so in total you dilute one stimpak into 6 diluted stimpaks instead of 8

World full..ugggg

Thaaaank you for visiting Flooptown! More proud of our little town than I am about our smithy shop but we appreciate your business! This feeds right into Flooptown's economy, ya know. From the farm to the food stand, from the bar to the barn. Ingredient farming takes more caps than you would think
---
Patrol Duty and Jail Break have honestly just slipped my mind lately, since the weapon plans are far more available now, but I do know I‚Äôve gotta go back to check those out.
---
Swarm of Suitors was bugged for so long with the start condition that I‚Äôd stopped doing it.
---
Census Violence is another one I just don‚Äôt often bother with. I think the one time I did I was near a SAM battery and that made it super fun (and loud)
---
All of those will get more data as I go, for sure
---
It‚Äôs fun! If you like the fallout universe it‚Äôs a very enjoyable game. I think it has better potential for role play because you aren‚Äôt hand fed a storyline to be a part of. The grind gets a little boring at times but the recent updates have pulled me back in fully. Bugs? Sure here and there. For the most part I haven‚Äôt had too many. Had more with New Vegas. Nearly 500 hours and don‚Äôt see myself putting it down anytime soon.
---
Why else am I paying a sales tax?
---
Fix the damn roads and my turrets!
---
Andouillette.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm very confident on the Int thing now, I wasn‚Äôt when I started.
---
And thank god about the Pilsner recipe, I‚Äôd just written it off completely before it got fixed lol
---
It gets put back in when your vending machine is destroyed. Shouldn't be happening under any other circumstances though
---
Yeah I‚Äôm not saying my reaction is reasonable, I just see ‚ÄúVersus‚Äù and reflexively ignore it :P
---
I know, hard to because I always take these things as personal attacks and I know most of these things aren't (at least most of the time). Thank you for being a kind redditor stranger :)
---
Uh yeah? Been getting 2 3* each run, atleast. Group of 3 playing the event.
---
It wont show on the map if the machines have nothing marked for sale. Ive had my machines completely de-tag my sale items about 4 or 5 times and when it did that it would take my icon off the map
---
On PC objects are solid when you pick them up, is that different on console?
---
Camo isn't supposed to shop up on a map. It's camo! Seriously though this happened to me a day ago and I ended up having to fully restart my PS4 for it to work.
---
And it‚Äôs so much better with more people, too! God I had a run with like five other people and we got about five legendaries to show up. Everyone was very polite about tagging them, too.
---
Yep, I‚Äôve got a few of them I think. If you need one, hit me up, ign is Ephesos
---
Not pay to win , there is a item in the atom shop that lets you repair weapons and clothing it goes for 50 atoms. Is pretty much a time saver, not only that but getting stoms is easy i wouldn't call it pay to win just qol. Also the grind is not boring but addicting, wait till you are high level and you lurk around the discord waiting for nukes to pop up to fight SQB. Only thing i wouldn't recommend is survival since it has a lot of people with duped gear and you get instant killed.
---
Sorry forgot to say, I‚Äôm on PC.
---
Lots of weights in the yard since you‚Äôre right there as well
---
There‚Äôs a limit to my patience. Some dude was sitting on the imposter for nearly 10 minutes, I started bumping him away with a swingspeed knife while another guy trained some enemies back. Dude finally reacts and calls me autistic and toxic, kills the enemies, and goes right back to the vendor. Like dude, it doesn‚Äôt take 10 minutes to decide between 3star armor or weapon. Toxic? Toxic is freezing up an utterly unique vendor for 10 minutes with other people waiting.
---
Weightless hazmats, please. Or hell, even just regular hazmats no longer counting as armour for the Chameleon mutation (seriously, that makes *no sense*).
---
I‚Äôve happily only seen GM break like twice. And yeah, I admit I‚Äôm undervaluing UF a bit, but it‚Äôs stock rises for sure now that the Purveyor is here, you‚Äôre very right.
---
(Some of this analysis was written pre-Purveyor, it‚Äôs all been percolating for a while as I compile more data)
---
Oh good, me too, or that would‚Äôve been awkward lol
---
Not to worry most console gamers hate you too!
---
No kidding, right! How much do you want for it?
---
Yuuuup, pretty much lol. And again, thank you for posting your data, it really helped me solidify the constant cap rewards thing.
---
I got one from there just now to make sure again and got the junk version.  [https://imgur.com/iWZZgh3](https://imgur.com/iWZZgh3) 
---
Maybe it can spawn either of them.
---
About the SQB fight and other possible stronghold/boss fights. Are they soloable? Is there matchmaking? or would it be like Destiny where you have to find people?
---
I killed two ghouls at WS who were both 3*, and dropped 3* legendaries. First 3* ghouls I've seen there in like a month too.
---
Hey GlassFish, still interested if your around this weekend.  thanks.
---
I‚Äôl check it out!
---
Well, I‚Äôm back and not a bot...or a spammer, or troll.
---
No matchmaking you just join a random server and that's it. Everything is soloable as long as you have extreme gear. But usually you cant solo the queen a lot of people sees the nuke and go there, so you will always have people fighting with you and it goes by quick.
---
I got the same roll!
---
Thanks! Exactly what I wanted!
---
Well said.
---
You guys are really asking for a whole lot and not offering anything in return.
---

Literally just got off a 3 hour play session with wife on PS4. Had the game freeze on her once but that was the sum total of our problems. Wasn't even a server issue just the game stopped responding so she had to jump back to main menu. When she got back to server everything was fine.
---
For all that work you did? I‚Äôd feel bad if I didn‚Äôt give you something. Also, I just added you.
---
üòî the real gamer oppression
---
Did you get a server disconnect? That's usually what does it for me
---
This as well as the ability to equip leg and arm armor, I can understand no chest pieces
---
Didn't saw him in weeks... I'm worried about him :(
---
Depends what gear you have.  Extremely powerful stuff like legendary weapons tend to have low durability as trade off for high damage they can do.  Between the last time I repaired my level 50 Hunting Rifle was about 3 days ago. Granted it isn't my main weapon but even my melee weapon I use when I'm in the Forest region to save on ammo was about 8 or 9 hours of use before the last repair.
---
Now your next stop
---
Medic Fatman
---
Me and my friend had been on the server for quite a while and there wasn't a nuke beforehand
---
That still sounds pretty good, what about that card that gives you 80% more ammo? Does it double that?
---
I spent an hour of being over encumbered walking to watoga just to find out they didn't have the plans. I've started a new character, I have been a disgrace
---
That would NOT be good news for my build. Lol
---
How do you send a message?
---
I don't have any legendary armor atm, but my primary weapons  Civil Unrest and a non-legendary level 50 pipe revolver because I have a pistol/shotgun build. I use a Bloodied black powder pistol to kill Scorchbeasts and my main melee is All Rise for low-level areas or when I'm low on shotgun ammo. Even still, it seems like I'm repairing everything WAY more than I used to, and it's my armor that seems to burn out before my guns
---
Shit fam. You right
---
1. grindy? if you dont enjoy where you're at. if you played fallout 4 and roamed around for hundreds of more hours managing settlements you will like 76. if you beat fallout 4s story line and got bored and moved on you will not like 76. (most likely) I am at 900 plus hours level 238 ish on my main. I still enjoy logging in building some stuff just like in fallout 4 the only difference now is I people watch instead of npc watch. I watched a level 100 guy use wooden fences to create an "aggro" defense. IE it was porous but the goal wasn't to break the attacking mobs pathing to make them go around but to provoke them into fighting the fence in order to shoot them easier. it was 20 minutes of just watching him go and observing. 
---
2. if you go to ebay you can find anything you want concerning fallout 76. any game with free trade is pay to win. you too can be a master card hero!! I do not understand why devs think that is not going to happen if they allow trading. THAT BEING SAID if you go out and buy all the op godroll things and level up your character and go kill someone finally after leveling up enough to unlock needed perks you will be rewarded for all your time and money spent by getting a fat haul of 50 caps now.  (thats sarcasm by the way 50 caps aint shit, you can make more selling junk picked up in flatwoods) maybe in the past the pay to win factor was more important but there's so very little reason to pvp now even if someone did "pay to win": and killed me at my camp I would just jump servers and make more money retaking things than they did killing me. although I have been doing more pvp now that the penalty has been reduced. i find it less stressfull now and goof off with my friend a bit here and there. previously under old penalties that would have been too expensive.
---
It's not about the risks of it, it's about players being rude to one another. Asking for convenience and consideration is not the same as asking for the whe world to be handed to you on a silver platter. I can't for the life of me understand why you would be upset at this person's post
---
Also if you had the items on hand and putting them into the machine is adding them to stash box. I believe it will say budget is full, but it's actually referring to the stash box
---
Great!  I'm glad I kept it
---
Thank you. Its explains more detail of what to prevent in the future will see if that helps
---
Does anyone still play this game?
---
They dont seem to be.
---
Doing all these things these other non-standard ways involves a certain amount of legwork. That's a fancy high horse you're riding.
---
Did you remove perks like Gunsmith that reduces the decay rate of guns by accident? Are you using any perks that over repair your weapons and armor above 100%?
---
I've had that happen. Might be a bug.
---
Fuck hahaha
---
That was obviously an exaggeration, but seriously, I have tried a lot of builds. Heavy weapons was my first. I had all the right cards, but given the inability to get a sneak bonus with heavy automatic guns because of how much noise they make, their lack of good mods, the armor of the Queen, and the low per-shot damage they tend to do, the minigun and .50 cal with Furious didn't do shit but bankrupt me through ammo expenditure. The re-worked LMG is "getting there", and the post-patch Gatling Plasma is decent, given it's durability buff and ammo efficiency, but to make automatics viable for queen fights at ALL presently, they need a bare minimum of an 80% damage stack from Furious. And automatic small guns are a joke. Go fight the queen with a god-roll Furious SMG or assault rifle. You will quit in frustration very quickly, as well as go broke feeding it ammo. The automatics that "work" are AA, Explosive, and Two-Shot, along with Fire Rate, which comes with the downside of being even MORE of an ammo sink.
---
I'm studying ecology ! that made me smile :) excellent post
---
Didn't get to most of the legendary effects. My post was focused on how to bring the "better" effects to parity. :)
---
Look at his other posts. Makes complete sense. He's one of them.
---
Where does he spawn?
---
keeps people playing. People are happy when they get there gear. Everyone on Reddit has duped gear. Just the way it is. Do I think it made the game boring yes. Once you have everything it's boring. That's why they need to bring back camp destruction. It got people playing again and makes it fun. Nothing better than harrassing someone and blowing up there base.
---
That was my initial thought, that I'd switched it out, but no, I still have gunsmith (rank 3) equipped. I also have Lucky Break but it's only rank 1 so it doesn't really activate too often even though I have a high luck build (unless I just don't notice it). Those are the only repair-related perks I have equipped
---
Been playing fallout 4 and have a chameleon leather leg, every time I crouch to aim the sight go away. And I am forced to stand up
---
I believe you are right because I went through a time where she dropped them every time, and then it stopped, but I can prime anything I find.  I assume it‚Äôs the same pool that starts with the decom shower plans.
---
No, dick.
---
&gt; I am a long time Fallout fan, however i‚Äôm worries that this game is a boring grind. Is that the case? 
---
Depends on your taste in games. If you are use to games that tend to hand stuff to you easily then yes it will be. If you are use to games similar to Destiny or even GTA Online were there is a little work to be done to get rewards then no.    
---
You do have to work to achive anything in this game but the grind is far less then other games I've played. 
---
&gt; Secondly, is this game pay to win in a significant way? 
---
Only if you so lazy you pull the video game equivalent of wearing diapers because getting up to take a shit is to much effort.
---
Regarding your edit, even drinks? They're only valued at 5 caps each but some of them you have to put in about 100 caps worth of stuff, not saying I'd ever sell them for that much but I want at least more than 5 caps for something as or more useful as a 40-60 cap chem.
---
Nice...nice
---
Oh I hate that bug. it says "cannot remove because its attached blah blah blah" 
---
if it is your camp your going to have to relog if that doesn't work you-re going to have to move the camp and rebuild the whole thing. (or live with it.) 
---
If your at a workshop you will have to live with it or jump servers and start over.
---
Yay! Another wasteland ecologist! Sadly I didn‚Äôt end up in that field, but once we get display cases you can bet I‚Äôm opening a Museum of Wasteland Natural Sciences
---
Manical laughter when you have a fatman out??
---
It'd be cool to have more uses for the personal terminal, but it might not be necessary for this. 
---
Here's how I think it should work. When you hover over an event, it should say "Press E to Join Event | Press C to Track Event" 
---
Then onces an event is tracked, hovering over it and pressing C would remove it from favorites. 
---
C was chosen for this example cause that's the default favorite key in the Pip-Boy, but maybe it should be something else.
---
Maybe you could manage your favorites in the terminal, but it'd be great to be able track events on the fly.
---
sounds like you should hate lazy developers, not console players.
---
No this is definitely a thing. Had my camp at max budget with spare space in my stash, tried to put something up for sale and it wouldn‚Äôt let me. Did all the usual trouble shooting, changing worlds etc but it wasn‚Äôt till I scraped a few items from my build that it let me put anything in my empty machine. Also side note if you don‚Äôt have anything in your machine you don‚Äôt show up on the map even when powered.
---
Did not know that, I was wondering why my camp budget is max even though I have way less stuff set up now then I used to.
---
...I‚Äôve definitely given one away in a post-SBQ Watoga party, lol. But then again, I‚Äôve run Encryptid many many times, as the sheet shows.
---
I‚Äôll be on in like 20min
---
Cheers man. Youtube, Steam etc are all fine with Anus\_Hammer, and Bethesda support gave me permission to use Anus\_Hammer in 2018. But Bethesda changed their minds in March, and they changed it CorgiDanceParty111 without telling me. After arguing for a couple of weeks with them, they relented and allowed me to change it to Anuz\_Hammer. A week later they changed their minds again and changed it to Mighty\_Hammer, again without telling me. They wouldn't allow anything to do with Anus in the name, not even Uranus was acceptable. It took till May to get them to accept A\_Hammer. FFS
---
It's a pretty good way for a lower (50+) level character to get some semi-decent gear to make getting better gear easier.
---
I don't agree with duping but let's not blame server issues on duping. The serves have always been shit since day one.
---
Thank you both
---
I still have it in my stash. I'll hit you up when I get on, hopefully the timing is right.
---
Good to know! Obviously at some point I‚Äôm gonna have to try it, for SCIENCE!!!

Trading posts are no longer allowed on /r/fo76. There are a multitude of trading subreddits available - please submit to a trading subreddit of your choice instead. If your post is not about making a trade, please message the subreddit moderators using the link at the end of this message and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
There is a post where someone dealt damage to another player's camp after camp immunity using Orbital Strikes.
---
Can't no longer find that post though
---
lol noice.
---
Don't know what to say because I've not noticed any increase weapon break speed for me. Hell I'm savaging the area just to find already damaged crossbows for the Archery badge because I literally crafted a level 50 cross bow and removed the gun smith perk and used it exclusively in forest and toxic valley region and it didn't even go below 120% repair rate.  Eventually I just said F this and am now just trying to find damaged ones off mob drops.
---
the only thing I've noticed is that my leg armor both my normal and power armor seem to be damaged more often then other parts of my armor.
---
Spraying you with his healing mist
---
I‚Äôm confused by what you mean? Like plans for drinks? Those are valued at 50 caps.
---
If one person stays in the menu it lasts longer. I've called in a whole server and didn't die til after everyone had a chance. Ive logged out and back in to change inventory and no death. I've fast traveled to someone who messaged me holding him there and no death.
---
Sinks would be great, being able to build a better kitchen and gather water from inside my home would be nice without needing a water pump indoors. Would just be dope
---
I‚Äôm adding you just because of the gamer tag.
---
Cheap and easy events like feed the people.  Morgan town has 3 and they usually drop 1* junk.  Since level doesn't matter, as far as I've seen, a level 10 1* is as good as a  50.
---
Uranium Fever because Steel and Scrip. The End.
---
üò≤
---
I would pay real money for this. Twice, probably.
---
It's probably just a problem because of me then. I'll look into changing up the way I play and see if I stop getting so damaged. 
---
As for the crossbows, I think I've always picked up more in the savage divide than the forest or toxic valley. Try clearing out some locations through there
---
Someone knows where to farm Legendaries.
---
It isnt pay to win imo however it does feel like pay to feel included at times. The draw for me is the camp building, its no secret fallout is not the leader of combat. Been a fan ever since the first fallout, and something i have always wanted is to be able to play with freinds. Im glad i now can, but i wish we had offline gameplay and mods. The updates have been great though. The world also makes me happy, some areas are great and set up like scenes from a dam movie. Really does feel like the end of the world.
---
USPS? I see you‚Äôre a man of culture.
---
I want a ZZ Top style beard.  üòé
---
It's an open map with events. The big ones (SBQ, imposter) get announced globally, so half the server will usually show up. I would not recommend starting the sheepsquatch imposter event without a team, because the prep time is far too short, but it's fine to join one. Starting the SBQ fight is fine, just check that you're not in an empty server first.
---
Main issue is that those are the only two boss fights, and one of them costs 2k caps to start for some reason. It's not like a designed looter-shooter. You need to be comfortable with a lot of low-intensity gameplay.
---
Then you‚Äôve been very lucky compared to me.  May the RNG gods continue to smile upon you.  He‚Äôs never lasted more than 2 minutes for me.
---
Would love to be able to change the personality!
---
Indoor water collection. I like the idea.

My friend is this a map to supply loot üò±

Farming the raw flux is easy. Just get the Green Thumb perk, run into a nuke zone while wearing a Hazmat suit and gather all the glowing plants.
---
However, *stabilizing* that flux is hard. Because the stuff you need for stabilizing only comes from dead enemies in the nuke zone. As long as you stick with other players, you can tag enemies they're shooting and loot the bodies for the stuff you need. Then go back to your camp &amp; craft Stable flux from the loot at your Chemistry station. You need 10 of a specific Raw Flux, 1 fluid and one Hardened Mass to create one Stable Flux of a particular type.
---
Really though, flux is an end-game material, so you don't need it right now.
---
They are really effing rare
---
The struggle! Sorry I think that's where I got em, but it can spawn in many places apparently.
---
They have a weight!?
---
That's so ridiculous and I cannot store them right?
---
I have a BMG rifle, it's fine to fire from your shoulder.
---
I believe you can only get them from the mire region and only if it had been nuked. So, one would need to nuke the area from Abby's Bunker to Dyer(?) Chemical for the optimal effect.
---
The Heart of the Swamp quest has to be going for them to spawn blooms.  And you can find them around Dyer Chemical but not many.  Check mappalachia and keep your eyes open for the quest!
---
Pipe guns are much more fragile then other guns and I think they need a different perk card to increase the durability. I don't think gun smith works for pipe weapons there is another one for them I think.
---
yes yes, I'll be in touch
---
Those illustrations are so good! I love seeing things like that.
---
You can get the plan near the Tadpole camp area. Search any of the map websites for the Crossbow plan location.
---
Pretty average stance on this sub. If your not willing to dedicate your life to a glitchy grind why are you even playing this game? The superiority and self absorbtion is very high on this sub way above the internet average.
---
West side of the Shangri la thingy, there's a some targets set up and a crossbow. And 1 in the basement of the house at the sons of Dane, behind LVL 3 lockpick
---
You are trapped in the game!
---
You fool.
---
Im fatigued of all tedium. Id rather lose my bonus and just use power armor in blast zones right now. This improvement is most needed.
---
Yeah and than you come on here and think these cant be the same people.
---
These people honestly bug the hell out of me sometimes. I have had this happen multiple times now at my camp. They will come look at my wares and then ask to trade. I will just sit there waiting, because nobody just opens up trade hoping the other person wants something right?? But nope, they are just waiting and hoping I want to buy something from them. Get off my lawn ya damn scavs!!
---
Thank for responding, relishing might work? I‚Äôll try again.
---
I've got a quad explosive one ps4 if your interested
---
If you log out at Dyer chemical and load back in they will be there it is a bug might have to do this a few times but usually works for me on first try
---
Berserker needs you to have zero damage resistance in order for the weapon to give you max damage. So you pretty much need a berserker build with no armor to make the most of it. I'm planning to roll my next character as Berserker.
---
This game gets shit on a bunch. But I've encountered nothing but good people, I still play it, still love it.  Don't really care.
---
Check the vendor bot at the amusement park. He seems to have a lot of these.
---
Haha ok, I have a berserkers explosive handmade Ill sell you cheap
---
you must have.posted in the wrong community..this.one is very active from what i see
---
My thoughts exactly. üò¨
---
Yea not quit understanding the decision making behind this one Bethesda.. EVERYTHING prior to these hair styles was unisex. Why now?
---
Ghoul Slaying, Bonus Power Attack, Reflect Damage while blocking.....I hate the stupid bone club.
---
Well you can tame a dog and have it at your camp
---
ive run into him 6 times and he never had the hunter jacket. lots of space suits though.
---
ive since found a perfect farming spot for him, i dont tell anyone about it. still no jacket tho
---
Correct me if im wrong but thats supposed to be the whole point of the packs. When you open a pack the cards within should be able to be equipped. Or else why have them to begin with?
---
is it the stealth blade mod?  i have that as an option but have never crafted it
---
I think everyone does lol. But that whole thing is burned into my brain.
---
No
---
madlad
---
Damn, that‚Äôs unfortunate - thanks for letting me know.
---
Leaving unlocked purifiers is a nice thing to do for people who visit your camp. Not to mention that purified water is a good way to heal your character in a pinch, especially when stimpacks are scarce.
---
Biv, and the two pioneer scout daileys reset at 8 eastern they are not tied to the same 20 hours as the vendors
---
i‚Äôm all over that cranberry cobbler. green thumb &amp; super duper i average around 30 per aaronholt run.
---
Here are some more.
---
Have the snap and ground placement system just a little more forgiving.
---
List of new turrets
---
Minigun 
---
.50 cal
---
Gatling Laser
---
Plasma
---
Ceiling and wall mounted turrets
---
Electric ballistic turrets to remove smoke.
---
Spotlight turret cost reduction. It doesn't do much besides illuminate and point out enemies.
---
Ceilings. Drop ceilings, paneling ones plaster etc.
---
Functioning desk fans
---
Have the clocks in your camp show the in-game time. Their new and wouldn't have been effected by the bombs.
---
Ground placement objects have a skirt of dirt around them so they don't float.
---
Additional snap angles.
---
Conduit connections for terminals, turrets and artillery.
---
Manufacturing equipment like FO4 Automatron and require a LOT of power. Like a dedicated fusion generator just for one of them.
---
Additional power generators
---
Steam (requires coal)
---
Water wheel
---
Solar panels
---
More windmills (and speed up the rotation)
---
Better snapping/sitting for conduits. ¬†If on a sloped roof they will angle to match.
---
Conduits attach to walls.
---
More vertical conduits.
---
More curved angles for conduits. I.e. 60, 45 and 30 degree angles.
---
Have a blueprinted structure drop EXACTLY as it was blueprinted. Don't make it try and re-snap everything or give that "item is floating" nonsense. ¬†The game accepted it the first time.
---
Larger Blueprint budget. A lot of stuff gets split and cant be placed.
---
More workbench models. Pretty Please!
---
New workbench: Electronics. ¬†Requires Science 2 but allows the crafting of circuits and rare drops. ¬†It would allow a player to use their existing resources to create the one they might need.
---
New resource generators.
---
Log splitter: generates 10 wood per in-game hour. Requires 10 power.
---
Kiln: generates 5 ceramic per in-game hour.
---
More sleeping bag models/colors. You could just mirror the model for a start.
---
Let things snap to the pillars under the "stairs" menu subsection.
---
Wall switches with conduit connections.
---
Smaller wire attachment points.
---
Please add non-wire grate floors to the side stairs.
---
Usable electric stove. ¬†Removes wood cost from crafting food items. ¬†Requires 15 electricity.
---

Man, his water bill must be so high if his showers are this long...

Or just actually have him insult us when we run into him!
---
Scout armor pieces can only be bought from MODUS and scrapped for plans as far as I know.
---
I am very interested in that!
---
Riding around west virginia on a bike sounds like a really nice mode of transportation other than walking and fast traveling
---
I have never gotten a plan from scraping any of the armor and I tried with 30 of them.

Middle mountain cabins can spawn one

I use it, then stimpaks are only needed during fights

that‚Äôs a great location.
---
Hope your not in survival mode.
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be happening, but it is. Along with a lot of people who commented on this post. We shouldn‚Äôt be dropping to zero frames during the only end game bossfight currently in the game, but what do you know...
---
Maybe allow him to be a vendor that buys and sells things like any other vendor bot, just to allow us to sell things without leaving our camp. Similar to vendors you can have in fallout 4 settlements.
---
Haha fair
---
I don't believe I am. I think I saw it as an option but I don't believe I am. Am I supposed to be seeing a lot of people or is the game long past or just too big?
---
West tek is probably the best place for caps/exp/legendaries. Be warned the super mutants with automatic weapons pack quite the punch.
---
For plastic whitesprings, get the golfballs and the nuka cups with straws and the stacks.
---
For steel do uranium fever, now there is a 50/50 chance for there to be a ton of enemies or only a few. With a lot of mole miners take their entire inventory, you should walk away with ~40 weapons with the Scrapper perk in Intelligence this can net you several hundred steel per event easily. Also the mole miner drop useful junk, sell the glowing blood and meat and any of the weapons you don't need to scrap
---
For lead go to each of the three bunkers, each bunker has a small gym with weights, each weight contains a varying amount of lead. There is also a motel near the beginning town of 76 I cant remember the name of with another small gym to loot.
---
I had a weird glitch yesterday when at west tec, my accuracy dropped into the toilet. Couldn‚Äôt hit anything! Luckily it fixed itself when I left
---
1:1 for everything except .38 and ammo over .2 lbs. (40mm, missiles, mini nukes, etc). I set them at 0 and people still don‚Äôt take them.
---
This happened to me as well on Xbox. No red circle or rads but the enemies were all glowing ones.
---
I have a theory about moving props in this game might be wrong. The only big moving object in this game is the bucket excavator on mount blair, elevators dont work like elevators in fallout 4 they just teleport you and camden park could have working park ride because nuka world has them. Either bethesda is to lazy to impliment or they get desynced between players and could cause problems.

He showed up inside Mamma Dulce's to help me finish off a wave of ghouls trying to destroy the machines. Took a CameraMode pic of him, so not best framing. I'll try to upload.

LMFAO people are so funny ü§£
---
The only thing that could technically be considered P2W at the moment would be repair kits, and even then that's stretching it a lot. Upgraded perks such as "weapon artisan" and "fix it good" in the intelligence category easily out-perform repair kits as they can essentially repair weapons/armor 200% past regular condition. As for being grindy or not, I personally think its not too bad, especially with player vending and the legendary vendor/legendary exchange available.
---
Which one brother?
---
We are the yellow dots. Since you‚Äôve played ESO before, it‚Äôs a similar concept with a different theme.
---
There's a period of time after a nuke where glowing ones and flora are still present, but the red zone is gone. Glowing ones won't drop flux mats.
---
His outfit is in the files for the atomic shop I would love a video of someone going door to door signing people up for a vault
---
Ohhh how'd you know I played ESO before :o?

On most traditional forums ballistic ammo goes for 2 bullets per 1 cap

@Tanagra

Would love to get a Bleed Effect.
---
Used to have a Plasma Shotgun in F4 with Bleed Dmg and it was insane, even only 1 Star.
---
It will pack up your camp.
---
That's what she said.
---
I can do it for you for, say, 300 caps. Free if you provide the materials. I have all of the mods unlocked if you want it primed or want the rifles barrel.
---
Well it's online game in the meaning that other players play on same server. You can ignore or interact with them. You can play alone in Fallout 4 style like i have done my 400h journey, or get friends and complete quests and explore with team. It's easier and funnier that way. Basically Fo76 is Fallout 4 where you can't save or load, and when you die you just respawn. What ever you do is permanent, scrap your favorite weapon and you can't load previous save. But luckily quests don't have any choices like every other Fallout game has. You can't decide what to do, you read or listen stories and follow instructions. I'd say this is better than Fallout 4 in every other way except lack of RPG choices and NPC.
---
I can read minds and search past posts.

Not at all, just casually commenting. However, as I'm the creator of /r/necropost, and based on the sentiment you've expressed here, it's likely that you and I have different philosophies regarding the pertinacity of a thread's age when commenting.
---
From the /r/necropost sidebar:
---
&gt;Ever find a thread to which you desperately *needed* to reply, a thread that was *incomplete* without your contribution, only to find it's three years old and archived? A little bit of necromancy might be just the solution you need...
---
&gt;
---
&gt;----
---
&gt;[The purpose of this sub is to provide a venue for replying to topics that have "expired".](https://xkcd.com/979/) We reject the unfounded proclamation that "necroposting" is pejorative, or opprobrious. The unspoken and flawed assumption is that time erodes the value of words. Otherwise the works of Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and others would have lost their inherent value.
---
&gt;In the future, if ‚Äî though smart money is on on *when* ‚Äî we contact other intelligent life in the universe, the metronome of our conversational rhythm will take centuries, if not millennia, for one single exchange. Which makes the artificially imposed six month half-life of Reddit, and most communities, ponderously low.
---
&gt;Your conversations will  *outlive you.* Our conversations are no longer ephemeral, vanishing into the ether, forgotten. Or the only alternative, a static record beyond inquiry or interaction and a curiosity to historians. Our conversations can now actually outlast the original parties. The greatest achievement of the digital age is the ability to maintain the narrative thread of a group conversation over months, years, or decades, and this achievement is unprecedented in history. Others would see this paradigm shift in communication proscribed.
---
&gt;We humbly disagree.
---
I had this earlier today, to fix it I built a 3rd foundation to make a corner shape. After that I was able to delete them all starting with the old pieces.
---
Same problem here. I have scrapped over 20 without any plans.
---
I've been wondering about this too
---
Nice drop!
---
I don't understand why others can't keep the same etiquette. I myself try to because it's the right thing to do.
---
OH THANK YOU FOR THE ROYAL JELLY INFO
---
Also, have you found the unmarked treehouse at the very top right of the mire? Or gone to treetops? Those are fun to climb too hahaha
---
would be a nice idea
---
Thanks, this saves me so much time searching for worlds, but I didn't want to risk it with my camp how I like it.
---
Indeed and I will always continue to love it. I noticed others who stalk the game just to see it end but it won't.
---
Servers go down for maintenance and others who don't play say...
---
Just keep them off. No one wants to play it anymore.
---
Why are you beating around a dead horse.
---
Power armor in 76 is designed to sell people the sports car fantasy. I have no interest in sports cars with new paint. 
---
Anything that improves the non pa experience is a win for me.
---
2 and 3 star stuff can be hard to sell because they can't inspect unless you're in the vicinity. Also people tend to have a fairly narrow range of stuff that they want, regardless of price, so unless you're in a very high-traffic area then sales will be rare.
---
For example, I'd pay 3k for a one-star bloodied lever rifle, but anything else would just clutter up my stash.
---
Happened to me today.. 4 machined wiped
---
VATS and heavy weapons don‚Äôt really play well with each other. The nice thing is, you don‚Äôt really need them to. I‚Äôd move the VATS luck perks to bloody mess and starched genes/class freak. 
---
PA is basically required because of Stabilized.  Which means you don‚Äôt need adamantium skeleton (cant take limb damage in PA). Get Fireproof or something. 
---
Lock and load does cut down the long reload times, but, usually you‚Äôve got a pretty massive ammo supply,  it‚Äôs not often that you really need fast reloading. Taking a utility perk here wouldn‚Äôt hurt. Maybe blocker for even less melee damage, pain train for charge stagger, or if you want to (i enjoy it!) add on explosives to your build- it means a few changes (ordinance express, grenadier, demo expert) but I find it synergizes very well, especially if you can get your hands on some form of explosive legendary like a bloodied/furious explosive 50cal. All the launchers are heavy weapons for Bear Arms and Stabilized.
---

---
Is what I run. I don‚Äôt use class freak most of the time, and I used to never mutate in PA, but it‚Äôs happened twice since patch 8 so I think i need to add starched genes to the mix.
---
I do run a low health build, thus the nerd rage, adrenal reaction mutation, and stranger in numbers (I run in a group). The damage output is phenomenal. I don‚Äôt even use much Gunsmith anymore, it‚Äôs mostly filler points- with the damage output I have, it takes very few shots to down enemies, which does wonders for weapon durability (excluding those poor explosive launchers, but they‚Äôre a different story)
---
And different voices! 
---
Protect and Serve. 
---
Hoowwddyy Parddnneerrr. 
---
Did you visit my CAMP just to hear my *soothing voice*. 
---
This is Raider Territory. 
---
The list goes on!
---
It sure affects their pip-boy damage. In fact it stacks with the perk.
---
I agree but some people argue that the Repair Kits are P2W.
---
Pocket camp.
---
If you are using heavy weapons you should be using Bear Arms and power armor. Stabilized is a keystone HW perk.
---
I have one so I‚Äôm holding out hope for a future companion
---
I thought getting back 40 scrips was better than caps
---
You should explore the lucky hole mine next üòç
---
Since beta
---
DontTreadOnMe83 said it remains where you left it as long as you don't place it somewhere else. So I trusted him and tried it and can confirm it does.
---
Maybe, I was thinking same thing.
---
leftover item they didnt remove. i have 2 in my stash
---
The hardest choices require the strongest will.
---
I have an AA Gatling laser and it melts things &gt;.&gt;
---
serums penalty - 50%  if you have class freak its barely noticable and easily offset by first aid perk. 
---
I run healing factor and do not have class freak or first aid perk. I only carry super stims because lesser stims dont have enough punch with the full negative effects . howver by the time you are able to be stocked up on superstims you will not be taking enough damage to need them very often. shit has to go seriously sideways before I pop a stim now days. ( like armor and weapon breaking simultaneously while getting pounded by the queen sideways) mostly I just build up stims and sell them on my vendor.
---
You know a fire pole would just turn every base into a strip club. Haha
---
It really is. It took me a long while to settle on a permanent camp location but I think this is it.  
---
It's a short walk to Whitespring, and not an unreasonable walk of shame back from Fissure Prime when your stash is full and you're 200lbs cucumbered from a SBQ fight.  
---
The brook that runs into the pond is also large enough for 8 industrial water purifiers, even if it doesn't look especially pretty. 
---
It's also not a super popular camp spot (yet), so I've only had the "cannot place your camp" message come up twice in the last month. 
---
I think a lot of people are put off from placing a camp there because of Dave, but you can keep him from destroying your camp if you do the old "1 concrete pad, two stairs up, build a platform" camp, and throw some crops on the ground for him to beat on. I've honestly never had him do any damage to any structures or purifiers.
---
A, always.  B, be.  C, closing.
---
ALWAYS.  BE.  CLOSING.
---
I get the lottery aspect, but it would have been better if at least we could be more specific with the type of weapons, like perk cards are...
---
guarantee they'll find a way to monetize this lol
---
My game barely renders things when I'm sprinting.  I can't imagine how bad it would be traveling faster lol
---
I am at level 238 and also feel i can build more but I could just be happier with less at this point. and also no scientific proof.
---
yep, me too. i think it comes from them removing the restriction on "floating" foundation pieces. it seems like if you can reconnect the problem pieces to a piece thats placed in a better non "floating" area it will allow the removal of the floaters
---
It has never dropped for me and im bitter.

---
This guy right here, he gets it
---
It depend on play style, just keep in mind is basically forces you to spend 3 points on class freak or forget about healing from stims plus if you like to use Chen's for more dmg like psycho those are affected as well plus healing from this mutation works only outside of combat what i personally don't need, if i ever need healing it's during combat

Yes, they do. I was about to say that it's because you USE them, but you "use" magazines as well. I'm going to hold on to them just in case it's a bug and not a feature, and it gets patched.

No Fallout of Elder scrolls game has ever had a working ladder, they can't change it up now!

also, if you're interested, i've got two recall cards for the Encrypted event...interested in killing an Imposter Sheepsquatch?

Yup I got 3. I hope they acknowledge &amp; fix it ASAP. I can‚Äôt deal with it anymore lol next time I‚Äôm just gonna take away my vending machines until they specifically state it‚Äôs fixed. I‚Äôll go back to selling my stuff on LFGüòÇ

Not true in Fallout 4 the robot DLC there's a ladder inside the mechanist lair that you can climb up.
---
Thank you for the reply.
---
Can I check if region differences matter? I was going to get FO76 and I was given a choice between Asia, Europe and NA regions. What diff does it make? Is there a region with a bigger playerbase?
---
I used Licensed Plumber for a bit but I didn't seem to notice a difference. I'll put it back on and try to pay more attention. Wish I could find a good alt to it but 10mm pistols don't seem to be any good. I have a single action revolver but it does less damage and takes longer to reload so it isn't worth becoming my main pistol
---
Sounds good.
---
Yes, they do. I was about to say that it's because you *use* them, but you *use* magazines as well. I'm going to hold on to them just in case it's a bug and not a feature, and it gets patched.

Perhaps they just want us to see how GREAT the pannapictagraphist perk card is!
---
Brotherhood for life no questions!!
---
Not true in Fallout 4 robot DLC there's a ladder inside the mechanist lair that you can climb up. Nothing much up there just stims when I found it.
---
Fallout 2 had a working car that they player could "drive" (granted it was static so more of a make-believe), so cars have been at the core of Fallout for a while now. Fuel is not an issue either since they can run on fusion cells.
---
The terrain in Fallout 3, 4, and 76 does not really lend itself to cars but it could've worked for a buggy or something (think Mad Max).
---
The new power armor mechanics are basically like cars though...
---
Yep - it's the only "Drop your shit and get here" OG event.  Always worth it, though the end Legendary did get a little flakey for a while about dropping legendaries recently.
---
Wish the timer was a bit longer on it.  Quite a few times I've warped into it ending.
---
I had the same thing happened. I couldn't tell you a fix, just don't drop the camera. Or do. I had to find the camera again to re-start it and it sounds like you jave to do the same.
---
Good call brother Chad has it!!

Thanks you very much !
---
I've been in the same spot in the Mire for quite a while and I only get a few enemies once in a while. Scorched, Super Mutants, Bloodbugs, Liberators, Anglers, Mirelurks, Cave Crickets, Radtoads, Radstags.  
---
It was built directly on the ground but after putting in a vendor, some strange stuff was happening. Came back to my camp on the end of the first day to find that my generator got destroyed while all the turrets had no damage at all. I've even seen Radstags teleporting inside my camp just to attack my workbenches.   
---
That's when I decided I had to lift it off the ground, though I ended up having to fully rebuild cuz what I had blueprinted didn't wanted to place. It's still somewhat decent even lifted off the ground.
---
Guided Meditation will trigger very regularly if you walk into the place.  I don't think I've ever had it not start up when I walk in, and I walked in a fair bit when farming events.  The bonus regen status even is sort of nice.
---
Best part about UF is that it's a short walk to the train station.  Very easy to load up on shotguns and miner gauntlets that you can sell for 20-30 caps a pop.  Considering you can walk out of there with like 40 of the things plus legendaries to grind up for scrip plus rare outfits and plans and it's pretty darn decent.
---
Not true, in Fallout 4 robot DLC there's a ladder inside the mechanist lair that you can climb up. Nothing much up there just stims when I found it.

Amazon. I paid 14 EUR for mine.

Would be a good attention not sure if do-able if everyone had one on each server.

First two are correct. The third one is wrong everywhere for some reason. Should be 1 / (0.5\*0.6\*0.64)\^0.365 = +82% damage.

I know this is very old but I can't find many resources. Is healing factor just a plain no for our builds? My thought is I'm always 60 percent rads and this would eleviate needing so many stims

Explore, kill, read lore, quest, wander aimlessly, join a team, check out other players bases.

 Do whatever you want to do.

Yeah I‚Äôd love to see that in an up and coming update, and what would be even better is if there is a mr farmhand aswell to manage your crops of food and also ur water production

Shooting range at the tadpole camp has one on the tables in front of the targets.

Enclave bunker i think

I've seen it at a raider vendor train station near rose

I‚Äôd like it, I collect Berserker‚Äôs and I don‚Äôt have a handmade. I posted in this thread offering. Are you not on Xbox?

---
How dare you not write an essay in one sitting. Tsk tsk.
---
Supposedly it does, but only up to a certain level, and only if you move your camp. Which makes it even harder to verify because it seems like certain existing objects in the world also affect your budget.
---
So the real answer at this point is nobody knows.
---
Well, based on what I've seen so far, they did tweak the table for drops from her. I got 4 God rolls out of 8 total.
---
I thought internet's beard craze died out last year? People are still doing it? Wasn't cute then, isn't cute now.
---
It seems like I was blocked by OP. I can‚Äôt respond to her post. No clue why. Anyway, if you do buy it from her, I‚Äôll gladly match the price + 5k caps + 500 5.56 rounds.

No idea

What if there was a place with all the zip of Nuka Cola...

Dang i was hoping for more backpack variation. Having a shovel beside your neck has me screaming internally. Looks like lots of red stuff, red is good.
---
I was going to make this joke.
---
I will not validate you.
---
I love this mutation and I was never a mutation person. Although, it does feel a bit cheaty sometimes tbh, but it suits the character I have it on. Anyway, I paid 300c for the serum from a player vendor, don‚Äôt overpay for serums.
---
And if it snows and you see some is yellow, don't eat it.
---
I go back and forth with a two shot pipe rifle double dipping with pistol and rifle, sneak, iron clad bear arms and tav pharmacy and thru hiker too. Get to the zone, and drop all those for heavy, two hand, stabilized, and a few others. I swap every strength card, grab fireproof, and demolition. Got it down to a few seconds

We need a script limit increase to how much we can carry and how much we get a day.

Like everyone else said, yes should be there next time you load on a different world with spot not taken... however, please see previous post someone else made regarding a recent bug.

I agree PA has no need for a legendary buff even in my Excavator PA (4/6 pieces were lvl 25) the SBQ only did like 10% of my HP with a barrage of her ranged attack &amp; I have no combat build whatsoever.

I'd trade all the TSEs I've stockpiled for anti armor, 10% when aimed guns any day of the week. TS is too inaccurate, and explosive is annoying

Hey Colt. Message me your PS name. I have an alt outside of flatwoods that welcomes new players.
---
As a fellow scientist, I'm glad you've published this fine work.
---
Hehe I have a pic with the same mutant.
---
It's in your install files. You can see them with XEdit.
---
It's all good. No blame on you. I'm starting a new melee character, but I really need friends or else it's gonna get boring :(
---
I'm with you, that does make sense.

My issue with two-shot weapons has always been the accuracy penalty.

Next time I launch a nuke I‚Äôm planning on biking that area just to mess with peoples minds

You can also just bash low level enemies for that challenge.

This would be cool, but honestly I just want variants of the stair-with-platform that has something other than wire mesh as the platform section.
---
&gt;Seems odd they have yet to figure it out, but again, this engine is old as fuck and they really just need to make a new one already.
---
God damnit I hate this stupid argument. Pretty much every major engine is 10+ years old, and all of them get constant tweaks and upgrades over the years.

Ooh! I need to put up a no soliciting sign. Then yell at people for soliciting.

If you happen to actually buy it from OP, I‚Äôll gladly match the selling price + 10k.
---
Yeah having some robot assistances around the base or even as a companion would be a great feature.
---
And with class freak it‚Äôs hardly noticeable anyway. Run super atoms if you‚Äôre really concerned about the negative. I‚Äôm playing a rifleman and this works wonders for me.
---
I'm new too, I'm down to play with you if you want. The game gets a little boring playing on your own

Thanks for the tip.

I'm down to play with you, I'm new too

you've found an end-game mutation

Does this still work??

Where can I meet dave? I don't want to live there but over 200 hours in I have yet to meet a behemoth.

I think we should start new threads every drop so the sub has nothing but drop threads
---
It's all good bro, I needed to start a new character lol. No hate your way :) I just really need friends to play with before it gets boring

Doesn't get much better then that

This would be great

I don't.. feel so good Mr. Howard...

Definitely a feature I would like to have

And that's why St. Peter never called.

Man walks through decontamination shower at the exact moment something catastrophic happens. Hence forth he becomes immune to radiation. I‚Äôm fairly certain Marvel Studios is making a fuckin‚Äô movie about this as right now.
---
I agree, completely!
---
That actually sounds cool and it would be cool to have other ones that heal or defend. Some type of medic Mr Handy that slowly regenerates your health while not in combat and can also remove rads and diseases.
---
aah the random "oof" you sometimes get out of no where. I will pay closer attention and see if i can find the source now.
---
I agree with this, completely. Bethesda, make it happen.

Never enough fuel!

Maybe they could implement notifications on your pip-boy? You could check events from your data section instead of checking the terminal.

same, i bought it from a  player vendor for 10 caps lol

As in "top end" big name allegedly first-rate games, as opposed to second-tier studios or indies.  It's not a reference to financials.

üòÇüòÇ...fucking awesome.....thats alright, I bought 300 caps worth of lead just for the guy to bash me , just fucking around, triggering my electricly charged mutation and his friend one shots me and takes it back.....he was cloaked in the corner
---
Sounds good to me. Hopefully you're on the same platform Xbox?
---
LOL, I think you've mistaken me for someone who takes you seriously or thinks you are on anything but a sock account to troll. LMAO
---
"Where did I say anything about software?"
---
uh... right here --&gt; "a program wrote in c# will act the exact same as any other game also written in c#."
---
and you know that Windows is a "computer operating system" and is software right? And not the "computer"- which is literally why one ""installs the Linux operating system onto the computer"
---
but my time here is done, i showed you don't care about the game "I hope it does die soon" which  is ever so contrary to "Nah, I'll instead give my feedback like bethesda asks for on the game" (you can't even troll good, mostly comprised of moving goalposts)
---
All the while ignoring the link I shared where a real gamer optimized their system, like real gamers do- that is literally the benefit of having a computer over a console- where they said
---
"I did have exactly these kinds of problems initially; it was a combination of the game, a poor internet connection, unstable RAM, and an overclock that was a little too aggressive. Frustrating, yes, but it didn't take all of the fun out of playing.
---
Fixed the things I could control, and with the recent patches it now happens very rarely."
---
So my conclusion is that you don't care about the game, doubt you actually play it and just want to bag on people who do like it
---
wait how do you do the waffle thing
---
Sounds good to me. Hopefully you're on the same platform Xbox.
---
You can't learn plans on the scout armor. They can only be purchased from Modus, like the pieces themselves. Though you can get legendary ones from the new vendor.
---
Thanks Chad does indeed have the NV scope plans.
---
The constant kids screeching. I cant handle it.
---
Nice!

Nice outfit! I recognize the hunters long coat and I think the black cowboy hat. What‚Äôs the face thingy?
---
Sounds good to me. Hopefully around the same platform Xbox. I just need to beam focuser really. You do have the mod?

You do. Initially you need to revive an ally for the very first part of it. There's one mandatory revive needed and one optional.

I hear Ash Heap quests or search the corpses at the end of Glassed Cavern.

If u stay with the main quest for awhile u should only encounter  low levels. I suggest doing some Google before you start on some tips and tricks for fallout 76 and get a basic idea on whats what. There are very helpful beginner guides out there .

Nope. The double you get will just add whatever is the original amount. So one batch of 5.56 makes 20, and with ammosmith it makes 36. With ammosmith and a super duper proc, you will get 56. It's still a great perk, especially since you can just equip it before crafting without any tradeoffs
---
I‚Äôd like it... I posted an offer on it in this thread about two hours ago
---
It's not the console players....
---
PS4/Xbox both have had keyboard support for a very long time, but some sort of Illuminati Conspiracy stops developers from supporting them in FPS games.
---
It's not like a $14 USB keyboard would break the average console player budget that spends $80 on skinned controllers and $200 on arcade sticks....
---
Mods, my dude. Get Save Everything, Old Style Workbench Repair, Better Inventory, and Perk Loadout Manager. They will change your life...in the game anyway.
---
That would be amazing, what would also be cool is if you have vending setup you could set him to callout to nearby players as if he's minding the shop while you're out.

Beware "lucky systems," because they rarely are. You just had some bad luck. I've yet to get anything \*really\* worth the effort, myself, but eventually, by drop or by vendor...

No, really. Most games I have played with any sort of "turn junk into another roll" systems have return values of maybe %10. 10 items to regain your value. Immediately regaining %33 is not bad at all.

would you like a Preston Garvey for your camp as well?

I camt post in this group does that mean something?

Hmm. Interesting.

Thank you, man. I had a great time with your video.

I have been trying to tame for my alt and the best tames are obviously disabled or broken. No tame or pacify for miremurk kings anymore... deathclaws aren't tameable (seen both 21/91 both which worked before) no more sloths... haven't seen any yao guai

know this comment is a bit late but I read this comment before I tried and I think OP is wrong or perhaps on just PC it is just broken

Better yet, make it work like an outfit that goes over your regular armor. If I can throw on a swimsuit on top of a set of combat armor there's no fucking logical reason I can't pull a baggy hazmat suit over the same suit of armor.

Dont worry OP, i proved last week that most people on this sub are actually retarded. Since everything I posted was being downvoted i made a little experiment:  
---
made 3 posts:  
---
pvp is perfect, pvp needs improvement as there's not enough caps to be made and the 3rd was  pvp should have a 3rd mode where people want to play for more caps.
---
ALL THREE downvoted. There are literally losers on here who downvote just about everything that matters and upvote garbage posts like TWO , not one but TWO viral pet rock posts this week. OP , you are not alone. the pet rock lovers run this place. smdh

Why? Because hes sitting down?....

Here's a better tip for OP: Don't log out of the game when you're at one of (if not the most) nuked places in the game, or at the very least put on some PA.  It's common fucking sense at this point.

Ya I had a similar thought the other day (yours has more detail) but even something similar to automatron, like a build a bot system, obviously limited to one bot. Then have it customizable for, like you said, either maitenence or scavving, or possibly even defense.

I've started doing a new thing: When there's a Camp that I'm impressed by, for however many shots of the place I take, I donate the same number of film to them by dropping it on their bed. it's the opposite of bedpoo.
---
I want a more reliable chance to proc stagger. Skyrim spoils you with that shit, and combat in the creation engine (or just how Bethesda does it) is too stiff. I say if the combat isn't going to be adjusted to be more impactful, which would be super expensive, then maybe adding more status options for the player would make combat feel better.
---
Really I'm just wishing.

What platform are you on?

Old thread, but I picked up an explosive The Dragon and with all rifle perks it's listed as 745 damage with my build.  There's a two-shot one at a player vendor and it's only 460.  So it seems that 4 explosive shots is better than an extra 5th shot.   Still a ridiculous gun and a powerhouse for any rifle build.

I remember having this reoccurring guest who would always pay me even though I did it for free. Good times.
---
Did you not scrip it already?
---
I personally feel like you shouldn't b able to see ur scope cross hair even, considering how stealth boys (and other cloaks) seem to indescriminatly obscure everything touching the user. And in game terms, it balances being hard to detect.
---
Face it brother, PVP is a stupid mode for a game like this. PVP in general is stupid. What do you get anyway for being a "Raider?" Who gives a flying crap if you cant destroy a camp or grief someone. Grow the fuck up!
---
I have several hundred hours of gameplay (level 200+), done plenty of ash heap quests, and still haven't got a plasma grenade plan.
---
Np, if i did post exactly how to do this event, you would know, before we started arguing.

Also I can almost clean the vendor out selling all the weapons if it's a big spawn. Glowing meat is good to sell as well.

I actually have a toast every week to all the console players that keep buying single player, linear, meticulously paced and story driven games by the droves proving that the EAs and Activisions of the world are full of shit when they say that gamers no longer want that stuff and all we want is mtx driven multiplayer live services cum stains.

Which platform are you on?
---
Wow, just wow.  Thank you very much for this.  I read the whole thing.  I think I'll pass on reading the spreadsheet for now.  
---
Leader of the Pack is awesome for starting levels.  Three guaranteed low level legendaries.    Swarm of Suitors is good for photo challenges.  Mirelurk Queen doesn't like posing though.  I agree that One Violent Night is a lot of fun.  And YES, Biv!  I only recently noticed he calls women pc's 'doll'.  Census Violence used to be the only way to get Marine plans.
---
Man, done the campfire quest 4 times still no possum badges.
---
I want to find this place now.
---
Depends on what the factions offer and which ones are available... Order of Mysteries is my top pick, otherwise Free States.
---
This is how it's been since 4, or technically 3 as it applies to similar outfits.
---
Imagine having your biggest gripe with the game being you don't have a search bar. Lmao
---
Nice! I have a nice little gauntlet, with Troubleshooters, Weight Reduction and Swing Speed Increase: it was my first really great drop. The only complaint that I have is that I can't use it power armor.
---
Make sure that you get a third claw on that thing for a nice big damage boost! With your power attack boost (and some sneaking) you'll be one-shotting just about everything you meet!

It does until level 50, I could be mistaken though.

Note the 16 posts I‚Äôve made about this and believing it doesn‚Äôt exist cause no amount of caps I‚Äôve offered has brought anyone out of the woodwork to sell to me.

I‚Äôve been doing the Mistress of Mystery quest...went to Pleasant Valley, and found the place overrun my lvl 8 mole miners...this is too easy, thinks lvl 37 me...had to log off before I finished...logged back on and had to start the Infiltrate Pleasant Valley part again, as progress is apparently not saved unless you complete the requirements. This time, got my ass beat by at least a dozen lvl 68 super mutants. Third time, Same guys...server hop...4th time I got lvl 10 - 40ish super mutants...lots of them again...hard work soloing with no legendary weapons, but finally got through...

I‚Äôve written 16 posts about this offering crap loads of caps for the plan and no one comes out of the word work.  I genuinely don‚Äôt think it exists at this point.

&gt;  Heart of the Swamp because  the strangler heart is a ridiculous bullet-sink and can't be targeted in  VATS. Never had anything drop that was worth the time and resources,  and I swear it's entirely anecdotal that it causes Strangler Bloom to  appear. 
---
NEVER shoot at the heart unless you hate your ammo, it's not a bullet sink because it has high hp but the fact that it has a damage cap per hit.  Either wear something that mitigates radiation or wait for the gas to dissipate and whack it with your melee, heck even bashing without any perks does about the same damage.
---
Run pipes from your purifier(s) that folks can drink from maybe?
---
I thought it was a dog shaped mask at first, but now I‚Äôm also keeping it in case we get offered companions.
---
I didn't say that. And pacify should always be an RNG chance. I was taking about not being able to send one home as a pet or maid. So what if it's niche. Those cards are supposed to somewhat mirror each other but they are broken. I say that because to get an animal as a pet you don't need just Animal Friend. You have to have Wasteland Whisperer as well.

I am with u/Deviant_Monster on this one. The clunky UI design choices, that rests squarely on the dev's shoulders. And in all fairness they are probably sick and tired of working with it because the underpinning technology is - those on the know tell me - archaic to say the least.

Either wear something that mitigates radiation or wait for the gas to dissipate and whack it with your melee, even bashing without any perks does about the same damage.
---
The benefit to doing the event isn't in it's standard drops, but in that it's up fairly often if you server hop and is one of the few Mire/Free State events available to drop the region cosmetics.
---
Hello
---
One of the vendors at the WhiteSprings sells the plan (forgive, can't remember which one). I believe it's only a a coupla hundred caps. Some quick advice:
---
* Remember that you have to repair the crossbow three times for the badge. If you can, build it "single durability" rather than double since you can't repair the latter until the fill second bar is gone.
---
* Shooting dozens of crossbow bolts into the ground does NOT, sadly, affect durability (I, um... heard it from a friend).
---
* Bashing enemies with the crossbow burns durability much more than firing it.
---
* The crossbow is, let's face it, slow and sloppy... stick to the forest to rack up 50 easy kills rather than wasting time with tougher enemies.
---
Good luck!

Haha dirty dirty I do the same thing ive invited people to teams while me and my friends are pvping then pretend for a little we fighting against them send one to there camp and begin the destructionüëøüëøüëøüëøüëøüëø

Make a low health version. Get emergency protocols torso. Find yourself a bloodied gatling gun (pure efficiency) or 50cal (raw DPS). Amaze yourself with how easily you mow down everything and how tanky you still are even if they do get close.
---
Is my build; swap explosives perks to utility stuff and go to town.
---
This happens to me. I did a Nuke run today at bravo and kept having to respawn at whitesprings. If I can't respawn there, send me to my camp so I can repair stuff.
---
Those two have server alerts because they're unique in that they need to be spawned and failing can fuck over whoever spawned it.  If people don't show up for SE or Encryptid then the spawner is out a nuke/recall.  If people don't show up for Free Range then you just fail it and hop to a new server a couple of times and try again.
---
Considering the ludicrous amount of objectives in the 'Collector' challenge for instance, this one being just one of many, and the fact that in 1163 hours of gameplay I have only found 3 of the 5 magazines required I would think that this is a little bit beyond 'not wanting to do the legwork'.
---
But to each their own I guess...
---
I guess you also refuse to use any gear that is not self-found and consider those who trade for their gear 'plebs that rely on handouts'.

You get a free move or no c.a.m.p. until you change servers.

In Fallout76Prefs.ini look for the line "uVivoxVoiceVolume=100" near the bottom. Mine wouldn't go past 70 even though I had the in game slider all the way up. Changing it to 100 made voice chat a fair bit louder for me (don't mess with the slider after you edit the .ini or it will revert to 70). I don't know if 100 is the max value, but that is the value I see in some .ini files posted on other topics.

I drop 100's of rounds of ammo all over the place if you ever come across ammo laying on the floor in watoga station or whitesprings chances are that was me lol (ps4)

I believe that if you join the server when the nuke zone is in it's "cool down" phase, it may stay that way for you for some time. Other people may see normal flora, and you'll still see nuked flora.

I've read simewhere that in fallout 4 the game engine couldn't process land vehicles to move correctly. To work around this one train mission (or something that moved on land) actually moves the textures outside of the train to get around this to create the illusion.

---
&gt; It could be "be careful what you wish for" since the solution might end up in less Special points for you to slot your cards (since you don't need those spots for things like lockpicking) or even some form of cost involved in doing a respec (since you shouldn't need to respec as often if you have passives). 
---
That would be the bumbest way to do it, since you don't have any advantage with passive cards that would warrant such a reduction. You don't gain special points because of swapping, it's just a QOL change because it reduces the tedious process. 
---
If I wanted to invest more time into this, I would have a combat-only build - but I'm lazy so I usually have 2 lockpicking on most of the time, swapping the third when needed. Others are less lazy and really use all points for combat, where's the reason for stealing points from them?
---
As I said, dumbest solution possible, so it is in the realm of possibilities with Bethesda.

I took something out of the machine to reprice and couldn't put it back, I was over budget.  I tried relog but I'm still maxed.  Putting things in raises the budget but taking them out or selling them doesn't seem to consistently lower it.

Feel kinda bad, sold a couple of mothwings I collected in the vendor.. They sold quick at 750 each. I didn't know they wouldn't count. The magazines I knew about from trading. There's hard spawn points for magazines though if you want to make the rounds. I'm missing 2 and they're both issue 3 and need pipfall too.
---
And that's my entire point. You **need** to first look at the less popular effects, re-balance those, then work your way up to the most popular ones. 
---
I like the poison/electricity ideas.
---
Happened to a wood arm, definitely a bug. I've sold all the other stuff I got from the vendor, guns. I've not heard its happening to weapons, just armor. Either way it's shit, scared to get armor now in case it's an awesome roll and it removes the best perks. Stick with guns until its fixed.
---
Same, just happened to me. Probably because I've been server hopping nonstop to find a mothman / lighthouse event.
---
I want to be able to hot key my PA.
---
What this guy said! It always show the upper left corner if you check it too quickly or right after loading into a server.

Ditto, I hear they spawn from ash heap events.

Two shot. More DMG and less ammo required.

Oh‚Ä¶ yes

Bigger and Bigger with men across the country taking influence and advice from people in the industry. Here at Idle HQ we thought we'd talk to some of the people in the industry who know best and have a first hand look at the latest trends and styles that come out - the models.
---
At the envy of many men the model is the way many of us see how the [stylish formal shirts for men](https://oxford.com.pk/men/formal-shirts) clothes will look, I know many of us aren't model material (myself included), but that doesn't mean we can't draw inspiration and advice from these men who hang around the industry's elite, and who probably get style inspiration from the designers themselves. In this style lesson we spoke to model Carl King, who has appeared in magazines such as Disorder, Hunger and been photographed by Peter Cryer, to discuss his style and where he draws his style inspirations from.
---
Modelling has taught me to dress in a way that describes myself and my personality. When I started modelling my agent said to me I looked like the typical English boy so he wanted me to get involved with brands like Burberry and Ben Sherman. Classic English brands with a specific looks which is great and I would love to work with these brands. However for me street fashion is what feels and looks right.
---
They buffed them. Explosive lasers are super powerful. Regular ones can be alright with the right mods
---
How can they place everything so close together? I can‚Äôt get anything to even remotely overlap.
---
Second one is much better, armour pen gives you much more dmg then weak two shot effect (if you even manage to hit something with penalty to accuracy) plus fire rate is the best effect for bosses like sbq as she's quite immune to explosions.
---
I would swap lock and load for bullet shield and take some out of charisma and put into agility and luck. Bloody mess and dodgy

---
Have fun laughing across the map
---
Use third person when your cloaked and you‚Äôll have a little dot
---
Go with anti-armor. You get far more DPS because of the faster fire rate and in my experience two shot hurts the accuracy so badly. A quick note though is that I don‚Äôt believe the armor pen stacks additively. I think you ignore 50% armor then of the leftover armor you ignore 45% of that. It‚Äôs less than 95% armor penetration but still a lot
---
Items that are locked to have max one star will reverted to one star state.

Dr. Gonzo and I are doing well... *Rubs Shotgun*
---
Very heavily depends. With the armor penetration perk, anti-armor is way less effective because they stack multiplicatively. The problem with two shot is it increases the spread of the gun, and on a .50 cal it's pretty noticeable. Anybody who got "The Action Hero" survival weapon can agree that it misses a lot. I'd say stick with the anti armor
---
anti-armor. Two shots on a 50 cal is terrible. spread is so bad you are gonna miss about half of the shots unless you are dealing with some bulky enemies like mirelerk queen or sheepsquatch. You'll be forced to do close range combats  to save ammo and it literally becomes a shittier version of combat shotgun

I would like to have on that I could give a small amount of items, say... 20 lbs worth, and he could give them to visitors.

C.A.M.P. design should always be functional over aesthetic appearance. Although experienced C.A.M.P builders usually balance the two aspects of their building to create functional works of art. Players should be commended for their time, patience and dedication, especially those that create a CAMP for other players to interact, rest, and repair their equipment.
---
What I've found when building is the system limitation, and bugs (i.e. Staircase clipping) can make designing a C.A.M.P. really irritating and frustrating. I've built three C.A.M.P's near Pleasant Valley Station, all functional but designed around the Character. So two Chapels / Churches for a male vicar character - St James Church  https://imgur.com/xGez7Wd and a small Chapel https://imgur.com/sZxrKeN and a Hospital build for a female nurse https://imgur.com/C1NVi5q . When you create a C.A.M.P. that revolves around their profession it fleshes out that character, adding an additional dimension when immersing yourself into the world.

I get mine by killing glowing creatures.
---
What's the best way to find them?
---
Probably. Just check the specs.
---
That's how armor penetration stacks, but because the damage calculation is based on the ratio between damage and DR, halving the DR has the same effect regardless of whether it's already been halved. Anti-armor is always +29% hp damage even if you have other anti-armor perks or mods.
---
The only time you get diminishing returns from armor penetration is when the damage is more than 6.5x the armor, but that's not very likely with a non-bloodied 50cal.
---
That's fine with me. I'm more worried about kindness and consideration being used alot more than being a ruffian. üëç
---
Nuke zones for sure. Only location outside nuke zone i can think of is the mine right next to whitespring station. The mole miners are always glowing.
---
I tried launching a nuke once, didn't go well. I dont see many nuke zones either.
---
Well, they do have the tin foil outfits in game now! Lmao. Someone give him atoms to buy it
---
I wonder if you drop them in a bag and pick it up, or if someone else picks it up, it might count as found. I'm too busy rebuilding my camp to try at the moment.

---
I tried it a couple hours ago and got 3 3* legendaries. I really think legendary drop rates were increased.
---
You don't get the sneak attack bonus when there's another non-stealthed target closer than you are. In this case, the Vertibot.
---
A level 50 non-legendary Sheepsquatch would soak about 40 shots at 170 damage each. I'm not sure exactly what difference the legendary template makes other than the regen.
---
If you need a lot in a hurry take the workshop at federal disposal field in the southern part of the savage divide, (the spiky emblem on the map). There are 3 nuclear material extractors at that location. There is also 1 extractor at Poseidon energy but that workshop is pretty high traffic. The other way which will yield you less  but still useful is to kill the glowing mole miners at Blackwater mine especially when the event uranium fever is on as there are more of them. Oh and pick up every blast radius board game you see as they scrap to give you nuclear material
---
Thanks you sir! :)
---
Can be loot from any glowing enemy and as the dudes told you: it is 100% sure the you‚Äôll find everything you want during a bomb on Whitespring: nuclear material, glowing mass, hardened mass, raw fluxes, legendary stuff;
---
You buy the plan (Enclave armory vendor), craft them and scrap them. If that looks like a lot of junk, it's nowhere near as bad as unlocking radium rifle mods.
---
Don‚Äôt forget your green thumb perk to get double.
---
Really? In my opinion PA is one of coolest things in Fallout.
---
Some items like assaultron head and wooden armour can only be one star, most likely Devs working on purveyor forgot about it and now you can roll 3 star for those items but server see it as error and save only one star variant for you. If this will be some other game i will be outraged how they allow it to happened and didn't even attempt to hot fix but in this case i know that bugs are future and no one really care about those and i do the same now. Like when you kill 3 star enemy you can have one star legendary or not at all it's the same with purveyor.

Weapons factory, probably only beneficial for new players. Once you reach a certain level, all everyone wants are legendaries.
---
Sent you a request bro, I still need to do that too
---
The lack of vehicles isn't really an in-universe reason so much as simply down to the fact that level design that accommodates both vehicle gameplay and on foot exploration gameplay is nearly impossible to get right. If the content density is high enough to be fun to walk through then it's too cramped to be fun to drive through, and if it's big enough to be fun to drive through then it's too vast to be fun to explore on foot.
---
I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm much higher build without power armor than with it, the only reason I still use power armor is because in the nuke zones if you equip a hazmat suit it strips you of all your armor. I wish that would change
---
What is it??
---
Yes using ammosmith increases the ammo batch size and then super super gives you an extra batch when it fires
---
It already rewards you with the X-01 Quantum paint plans (well, partly). No more reward needed. Also, it serves as a distraction, the building beyond it holds shielded underarmor plans.
---
That's the first thing that came to my mind too.
---
Someone current me if I‚Äôm wrong but doesn‚Äôt uranium fever give a fair amount of nuclear material?
---
Sure, leveling my alt, like lvl 10‚Äôish atm
---
Can show you the ropes
---
Which event is that? What do you do?
---
Message me you SN and the minute I come across one I'll message you.
---
The event is called Uranium Fever. It initiated at Blackwater Mine. You talk to the foreman outside, run into the mine, turn on the extractors at a quest marked terminal then defend the extractors from waves of level 40 glowing mole miners. It also spawns a couple of legendary mole miners so it‚Äôs a decent place to farm some legendaries as well.

I managed an explosive black powder pistol today. First explosive gun I've ever had at Level 120+. It's not too bad.
---
What console
---
Derp my bad PC
---
Yes - the brother hood and enclave should show up in air ships, raider factions should invade, and npcs should start populating Appalachia , more places should become work shops and the borders of the world should be extended further. the factions of npcs are all at war with each other except the responders who are kind of like the minutemen and are out for the people, we should then have quests helping the incoming factions run missions and have off appallachia battle zones where we engage in faction based pvp on large maps like in Guild Wars 2 World vs World. also I miss riding vertibirds like in fallout 4.

Fallout 76 was built with the intention to be an online MMO type experience. Too many people want them to create a offline mode or create private servers but that is not what F76 is intended to be. They are not going to turn this game into a single player fallout experience ever. That is why they created a survival PvP mode and are coming out with a battle royale/death match mode.  Too many people are begging them to come out with story missions and private servers and NPC villages  etc and to basically change the game into a single player experience. Well you‚Äôre just going to have to wait till fallout 5 for that because that is not their vision for this spin off and never will be.
---
Amen. With how slow this damn weapon is, it really needs a buff, cause it does similar damage as the western revolver, but the western revolver isn't a damn snail. I think they should buff the single action so it's just a tad bit weaker than the black powder pistol in regards to damage.
---
What?
---
I've never played this game so I wouldn't have any idea how it is going.
---
I'm considering buying it, so I would like to know...
---
9 months in and there is still no batch-crafting...
---
Exactly
---
I've actually had the 2 shot for the last 80 levels of my character and has been my main kill them quick weapon for a long time.  I just got the AA one from the trader today. 
---
So I just want to know if it's better
---
What's that?
---
What's on it? Spec'd for heavy it's definitely an endgame weapon.
---
Just made a new account I think I‚Äôm level 17, don‚Äôt have anyone to play with kinda gets boring playing alone. Dolomite569800. Don‚Äôt have much time to play sometimes cause I have a four month old baby. Forewarning.

I‚Äôve had this same issue, the way I get around it is if it won‚Äôt let me build the crop where I want, I build it where it WILL let me and then move it where I want. I‚Äôve found that the move option is much more forgiving than the plant option

Nice one üëé
---
if you think that its a rpg looter shooter its good, but if you expect new vegas 2 you wont like it
---
I didnt but my GF got a max lvl TSE pipe revolver.
---
You might be running into this bug and need a ticket with bugthesda to fix.
---
Nore sure if this may help you but I got big performance gains with the following ...
---
\[In-game settings\]
---
texture quality = medium
---
water quality = low
---
lighting quality = medium
---
shadow quality = ultra
---
shadow distance = high
---
and all sliders cept grass maxed
---
next i made the Fallout76Custom.ini file inside my fallout76 folder to tweak the lighting a bit and make the game darker/lighter etc for more effect
---

hopefully this helps a bit good luck

This gets posted daily. There were a lot of high quality responses to this before. Please do some searching.

Don't scrap anything you're currently using or planning on using... Just dump junk legendaries that you'll never use and don't want to sell/trade. When you have a few hundred scrip saved up go spend them on whatever weapon or armor you're looking for. For example if you're looking for better Right Arm just use all your scrip to roll for an armor piece. It's basically a slot machine.
---
TBH, I hate the hero, it's the only 3 star 50cal I have the other is a 2\* furious with faster reload. If you run stabilized, it not as bad as your describe, maybe a little wider but not much, coruse I agree that AA faster fire is better.
---
I got a couple of pieces of vanguard cavalier, not awesome, but good for trade
---
The number one spot in the game for bones is Braxton‚Äôs Quality Medical supplies. They make full skeletons there for science classes in high school I guess? But anyway when you get in there you‚Äôll find like 15 skeletons and shelves of bones and skulls. It‚Äôs crazy
---
From memory, damage while aiming and a cheaper vats cost. Looks like I need to invest in some heavy gunner cards.
---
Same, if you‚Äôre online message me on reddit and I‚Äôll help you out. Or add me on Xbox live. Dolomite569800

I heard it wasn't at launch.... Smh

You're that guy that reads a review or sees a film with a 2 star rating and doesn't give it a go for himself. Only boys have there mind made for them, man makes his own choice, builds his own opinion so man can have his own say and not listen to hype and bullshit.
---
Man up, GIT GUD.
---
Holy shit, that explains it. Thanks! Also, how inconvenient.
---
Thanks for trying, i tried what you sent me to with no prevail
---
I see, thanks!
---
I‚Äôm available. IGN is roundyroundy
---
Where is that?
---
I don‚Äôt know why everyone‚Äôs telling you to farm the queen when ultracite power armor plans are available in a computer for free in the BOS headquarters at fort defiance. You‚Äôll have to finish their storyline first of course. But you‚Äôll get a full suit of ultracite plus the plans off of the computer
---
Tadpole scouts award I think
---
Okay going to add u now
---
Wel the thing is it doesn't shoot 2 bullets but one real and one magicaly spawned bullet. The other one could do 100% but if so, all the legendary effect would need to be buffed.
---
They're saying that you're more likely to get heads *at least once* if you flip it many many times. Not that the odds increase with each flip. It's always a 50/50 chance, but it's extremely unlikely that you'll never hit heads if you flip it 100 times.
---
Oh, i had to go into the .ini file and disable vsync and now im close to 3k fps in the main menu lol
---
Tadpole or possum vending machine
---
Imo, nope but as you level up you get access to per cards like contractor, and other that lower the mats required. And home defences that allows you to build other things. And you get more plans for other items that might look the same but cost less budget.
---
Much appreciated
---
Swing speed would?
---
Are you on PS4? Because in that case all the photos you take get saved to the PS4 itself in the photos. So you can delete every photo you don‚Äôt want being used as a loading screen from the Fallout 76 photo album and feel safe knowing they‚Äôre still saved in your PS4 photos.
---
Wow, that‚Äôs a really bad glitch. And *of course* exactly what is happening to me.
---
Thank you for pointing it out!
---
You can exchange your Tadpole badges for it.
---
One thing that bothers me. Why are there no .357 or 9mm guns?
---
Honestly
---
Since so much of F76 is rocky with mountains, I don‚Äôt see how a bike would function realistically. Plus would you really give up the jump ability with marsupial just to ride a bike around that can‚Äôt jump? I don‚Äôt think so
---
Scrapping armor can get you plans for mods/armor in question. But it's way slower that weapons. On average I do over 50 armor for 1 mod/plan learned.
---
  
---
As to raider and metal the plans are out there both as static drops and event rewards. @lvl 160 with over 400 hours on my main. I've gotten maybe 1 mod for scout armor after scrapping 75 pieces. As to metal/raider I have quite a fre mods/plans. I fide alot of raider aor in the toxic vally and metal in the divide/ash heap.
---
As to plan locations, raider forest/vally/divide. Metal ash heap / divide/ the mire
---
It's in the tadpole scout vending machine for 2 badges.
---
[](/skepticaltia)I can say for certain that the 3 stars I've gotten are far better than the small truckload of rolling pins and wood armor that were sacrificed.  
---
I wouldn't grind up anything someone might actually use tho. Sell that stuff, and use the profits to buy stuff you'll actually want with caps from player vendors.
---
he can sell  you lootboxes.
---
Understandable, I didn't know that though.
---
Tadpole vendor machine :) Costs 2 tokens
---
YES!! Im always switching between my hazmat and my outfit, and its really annoying having to go through all my armour.
---
Musician is def bugged
---
Exactly, this should be top comment. Vehicles would not work for this exact reason
---
You can if they are present
---
They‚Äôre not valuable at all. I‚Äôve never gotten anything good from digging up treasure. You sure aren‚Äôt going to get any legendaries at least. To me they are equal to supply drops in terms of quality
---
There are plenty of people complaining about not been able to inspect the gear in vending machines.
---
Yes if they are in a rectangle shape. Pick 1 short end. Place a way on the short side add 2 roofs over the rectangle and the place a way on the other short side connecting the roof to the other foundation. Go back to the first foundation. Remove it's roof then wall the the foundation. Then repeat on the other. If the wall does not want to move change to a doorway and remove
---
Nope.
---
Just having Event timers to check would be awesome!  
---
Then you can decide IF it's worth attending.
---
Pretty sure you get that with badges from the Tadpole Machine?

As a guide designer (retired), it so funny to see lazy developers copy pasting and not understanding the different imputs required. I both agree with you and understand the rushed deployment of the game industry. Not condoing it nor saying it doesn't need fixed. But it's a lazy way to do things
---
I really like the underarmor mods. Simple but effective.
---
You can. But the owner has to be nearby
---
I just throw my vending machines on the ground and put skull stuff all over the place.  Works for me.
---
Uh-huh
---
Yeah! If your online please add me!
---
Yes, pussy
---
I spent 200 tokens for 2 weapons I didn't want.  Good thing is they sold back for 40 tokens each.
---
Only a madman carries a fatman.
---
Can we just have the Fallout equivalent of a Segway (Nuclear powered of course!).
---
Have you checked your credit/debit cards lately?
---
Correct
---
Something a duper would say xdxdxdxdxd
---
It's really shitty. But not knowing this was possible makes it sort of funny. Sorry for your loss.
---
Yes, please! Had a few occasions when "flipping the finger" would have been appropriate.
---
But, I suspect it would be regarded as anti-social or negative, just like PvP is, which is actually part of the game sadly, oh well, I'll stick with emoting No when asked to Trade.

I've been collecting the magazines since realease, I have a hoarding problem. Plus when the magazine racks for our camp become display it will look sweet with all the mags displayed.

Meh.

I'd love that hah!

The ones you collected previously don't count toward the badge, do they?

I didn't get any marked completed that I had already.

Yeah, theyre fine, no transactions or activity

I‚Äôm traveling to Watoga HS now

sweet :) I accepted your request, but you're offline for me regardless :/
---
Fixing that now
---
oh i see ty m8
---
Yeah, here's an easy way to ensure the magnificent Mothman spawns nearby;  
---
1) Remove all armour and clothing.  
---
2) Stand in an open area, like a large field.  
---
3) Jump, Emote Help, Jump, Emote Confused, Jump, Emote Help, jump, Emote, Confused.  
---
4) Repeat step 3 until his/her/its arrival.  
---
Problem solved.
---
Well, you can become addicted to Alcohol, Med-x, Psycho, Mentants, Buffout, Calmex and possibly X-cell. I've heard you can get some pretty insane damage but it's hard to maintain because of how many drugs you have to do.
---
is this a woosh?
---
Not the same. Pooping in the decom is squishy.
---
I've renamed my main set and put a "z" in front of them all.  
---
Pop off the hazmat, scroll down to the bottom of the list and bang on the last 6 items.
---
thank you very much for this :) You rock! (Y)
---
but imagine the budget costs...

Not had this, and my PS4 is an original from 2013! (CUH-1003A)

#SLURP
---
Lol 1 wt lost
---
Have you got the Grognak costume from the atom shop? Cause it seems apropro
---
I got a furious explosive railway rifle, an anti armor tesla with limb damage and faster reload... the rest turned  back to scrip
---
I‚Äôd like to buy it for 250 caps (srs)
---
Maybe Someone used your email to make an account? Idk
---
Yea counted for me. One thing I've noticed though is that if you purchase a magazine from a player or vendor it won't count. You have to find and pick them up.
---
I'll prefer my BFFR Gatling Gun over my BE Gatling Gun any day of the week. It's time for you to try out some different weapons, OP.
---
Raw tp is best to drop at overpriced vendors.
---
Hmm. I can't imagine any scenario where I would've bought these instead of picking them up. Oh well.
---
Glad to hear it worked for you :)
---
I've been using one to fulfill the kill things with energy weapons challenges, works better than the non two shot tesla rifle I had earlier. The effect isn't as pronounced as before, but it's still extra damage.
---
I found it recently and I hadn‚Äôt even sent off a nuke...
---
I prefer bloodied than Auntie armor and then two shot
---
I get that it's annoying to die at someone's camp, but why carry junk in the first place? The stash can hold 800 lbs of stuff
---
There‚Äôs a Megatherium (Giant Ground Sloth) skeleton on display in the Natural History Museum in London!
---
800 lbs is 363.2 kg
---
Its too good to be true, which means its actually too good to be true. Which means REDEEM ALL YOUR SCRIP NOW BEFORE IT GETS NERFED.
---
I found the heart of the stranglers a while back. I can't remember where it was exactly.
---
The cores you find inside of suits are only going to have a 25% charge.
---
put all your junk in your stash, there is an option to "workbench repair" when you inspect a weapon at a bench
---
I've been repairing my gear with components. Did you run out of something maybe?
---
I got a few other terrible drops, but these ones annoy me the most on account of their weight:
---
2 Gatling Laser
---
1 .50 Cal MG
---
1 Cryolator
---
1 Harpoon Gun
---
1 Assault Rifle
---
3 Guass Rifle
---
So I am stupid.
---
Thank you.
---
I'll wear my glasses from now on.
---
Yes its buggy but good overall. 900 hours plus.
---
Just my experience so far I cant speak for all 76 veterans out there but I suspect many have the same mindset I do. 
---
you tube community - mostly click bait bitches riding the hate train getting views. 
---
the bag "scandal" - I bought a game if I wanted a high quality bag I would go to Dicks sporting goods. 0 fks given.
---
the duping - only matters if you pvp and want to compete - mildy annoying when getting one shot by random Dbags while defending a workshop - I learned to claim the shop then haul ass away and stay stealthed alot so they couldnt find me. if they took the workshop i would server hop and get a new one. this was rare most players are nice and actually help you defend I would say 1 out of 50 players have been D bags. 
---
server instability - super annoying at first - especially if using a workshop - I learned never invest past workshop resources because if the player's don't take it the server most likely will. on server disconnect you just log back in no harm no foul really - it was mostly irritating but nothing game breaking for me. in the past few months servers have been very stable but I still stick to my old habits because...well habits. 
---
bugs n glitches - a youtuber made a vid of 1000 76 glitches etc - i suspect many of these glitches were forced and or sought after - myself I ran into few types of glitches so far - 
---
1. stretchy necks graphical glitches - weird long necks looking wierd AF - doesnt hardly happen now days. 
---
2. sleeping ghouls attacking me - they slide on the ground and appear to be sleeping but are actually fighting - seems to only happen at white spring. F white spring. 
---
3. my best and favorite glitch - I was inside a building and went to get out of my power armor - I glitched into the wall and it threw me up through the wall a really high into the sky and I fell to my death - I was laughing hysterically and alas I could not get it to repeat. 
---
there are a lot of random glitches but less and less with every patch. 
---
the "grindiness" sigh.. look if you played fallout 4 and roamed the wasteland after main story line 76 is just like that - you make your own fun and just exist in the wasteland - if you didn't like that in fallout 4 you will probably not like 76. me- my play time consists of logging in building some stuff - killing some stuff - tweaking my character build - killing more stuff - visiting a friend here and there - people watching if they're doing something interesting - and killing stuff. no pve content can hurt me - I am an unkillable god to the entire 76 bestiary at level 230 something- leveling up does nothing for me but allow me to tweak my character a tiny bit -caps mean little to nothing - i have 8 k caps currently - I have had up to 25k which is max - I waste money on anything i feel like goofing off with - last buy - ghoul slayer flame thrower - payed 2 k caps - shot some ghouls - decided the fuel was to big of a pain - scrapped it at the legendary vendor - that's it man - I just like being in the wasteland more than any other digital enviroment - its not challenging theres no growth for me - i just log in and do stuff. that stuff varies depending - recently started selling ammo and junk on my player vendor - its a service - gives me something to do - helps others - good prices etc - 
---
hope that helps with youre decision if you actually took the time to read this wall of text.
---
Couple things out of 1800 scrip. Bloodied /vats crit/ 25% reload assault rifle.   Quad Tesla/ vats crit/ 15‚Ä∞ less ap.    A combat shotgun with explosive,  and a aae lever action.
---
Is this a bug ? Thought it was a feature considering the Gatling Lasers ammo are the cores.
---
I would try the Grafton responder vendor. If not that one then try the vendor at Mr Fuzzy place.
---
Best I got was a 2 star handmade (should have saved my scrip really) which does more damage the more times I shoot something.
---
i answered but not just for him hopefully others will see it and stop asking lol - tired of that question too.
---
I'll give crops back if asked, but I'm gonna take them at first either way. If only you could lock razorgrain, kek.
---
I've seen it in vendors quite a bit its not to hard to get hold of and dont forget to check out pans in camps its a lot cheaper their these days
---
The recommended system requirement is not enough for stable 60fps on low, so dont expect much.
---
Yes! :D
---
Now that's a tempting offer ;)
---
Can confirm my Vampire‚Äôs Hatchet with 3* from purveyor turned into a 2* when I loaded back in on that character today.  Not just assaultron heads and wood armor.
---
Extra Damage to Scorched and DoT poison :)
---
And maintaining thise addictions is the hard part to my knowledge. Don't addictions dicipate after a while, like diseases?
---
I am fully agree with u. As a Explosive build player only fragmentation grenade with mod is amazing. 4 grenades kills sheepsquatch, but I really want to use missile launcher and I think that will
---
Make quite difference in game. Just imagine that everyone will use missile launchers during scorched earth and just us usual scorch beasts. It even now real decent damage but the durability! 7 shots and it broke
---
Thanks..!
---
Toxic goo from West Tek or ionized meat without lead belly will get those rads up. Or hug some waste barrels.
---
Like, illyrio from game of thrones season 1(from pentos)
---
Photographer isn't bugged for me, I've completed it. You just have to make sure the subjects title is showing in top right corner before taking picture.
---
Musician one is definitely bugged. The only thing that registers is completing the one violent night event.
---
This is a tadpole scout reward you can purchase from the scout vending machine. Think it costs 3 tadpole badges.
---
I don‚Äôt use or have any Ski swords in my Inventory ...
---
high radiation fluids? 
---
herbivore or meat eater so you don't get disease then just copious amounts of raw food ?? 
---
meh at my camp sir my radiation trap is easily gotten around for your convenience o7
---
Yeah, but it‚Äôs a Ski sword, they can be 3-star, I saw a lot of these on vending machines.
---
Just wanted to add that you're a dick.
---
if you have some components in your bag and some in your stash it seems to not see both at the same time. so you have to have all of the in the stash or all of it in your bag.
---
Its a bug for sure. It removed the Ammo used a Core at a time. But now it uses a percent if a core then reloads a fully 100% core and uses his % till ityou realod again. Resulting in a realky long and messy list of Fusion Cores in your Inventory.
---
It was a problem in Fallout 4 and people made Bethesda aware. Now in F76 it was fixed up till Patch 9 I believe. Now its back to the way Fallout 4 had it. I send you a picture of Inventory.
---
That's pretty fantastic, truly in the spirit of the old world businesses.
---
Indeed great idea and make a little quest story line out of it. 
---
üí™üèªüëçüèª
---
Explosive does have meaningful competition already, but I like the effect ideas. Bleed and Poison might be too strong for second slot though.
---
see a shower? look for a window and climb in that way
---
I've been eradicating the wildlife lately (carnivore) but it spoils so quickly and then you get all those diseases from the spoiled meat. 
---
Appreciate your consideration for us glowers :)
---
Best thing I've had is a ghoul killer black power Rigel with explosive and +1 intelligence. Everything else has gone back into scrip
---
u/CarterG4
---
Fallout 4's contraptions dlc had a working elevator you could build anywhere in a settlement
---
Toxic goo. That should be easy enough! Thanks! Forgot about that!
---
if it goes boom, it works. it is +50% and +100% blast radius. explosive legendary explosions seem to work, but since its a small blast increasing the range is minimal.. but still good
---
I remember seeing Sarah Lyons and her squad in PA for the first time, I immediately wanted one.
---
At max level, many enemies including SBQ are 'glowing', which means using the Glow Sights PER perk is pretty sweet! I'd also consider using bloody mess for the +15% damage.
---
You're missing out on SO much damage potential by not having a Bloodied build though... adrenal reaction + bloodied weapons nearly triple your dps when you're below 50% health!
---
Like...monsters are attacking your base, that‚Äôd be cool...
---
Explosive perk and damage overall has been nerfed
---
had something similar happen at sbq was nuked back to back before i realized people did that. long slog to get that precious flux from my bag!
---
When did that happened. Ik about the first nerf though, i just wonder if they did extra changes in the latest patches
---
Wow really surprising that the Queen doesn't give u a drill lol, congats! :)
---
Nope, my tse handmade and gauss rifle have not changed in a while. Must be something you are doing or forgot to equip
---
1. I found I enjoy repairing power plants. I am unsure why its so damn gratifying for me but I do enjoy it. at level 230 900 ish hours it would get rough to find things to do some days. power plants.../shrug can I fix it! yes I can ! 
---
2. I run ammunition and junk vendor out of my camp - almost everything is 1 cap per. money doesnt mean a whole lot but i get satisfaction at providing a collecting service and getting a small wage from it. 
---
3. I kill the queen for advanced repair kits now less for legendaries- I have a vampiric gatling laser and I love it so much - only a three star vampiric lasergat could possibly improve it and the odds of that are next to nothing - it still makes me so happy after hundreds and hundreds of kills . if its my final and only weapon possible in the game I would be totally ok with that. I am also looking for a good berserkers 2 hander for some theoretical out of power armor sneaky sneak hijinks.
---
Yeah i had to use like more than 10 rounds  to kill a bloated glowing one  i remember it didnt took that much.

##### EXPLOSIVE SHOTGUN BUG FIXES
---
We‚Äôre also implementing fixes for a pair of bugs affecting shotguns that have the explosive legendary effect. The first was causing them to deal double damage, rather than the 20% increase the explosive effect is intended to provide. The second issue was causing the Pip-Boy to display lower damage numbers than explosive shotguns were actually dealing to your targets. While these aren‚Äôt true balance changes, it‚Äôs important that we address these issues to bring more consistency to both the displayed and actual damage output of explosive shotguns.
---
i got this, 3*, right back in the shredder.  I also got a 3* nocturnal switchblade with weight reduction, which helped a lot because ya know those normally weigh a ton!
---
I've noticed this with Lock and Load too, the heavy gun reload speed card. Sometimes it just nopes.
---
My friend doesn't run L&amp;L, but his gun has reload speed as the third star effect. Its' weird cause I don't have a RL speed gun. We think it's either Speed Demon being broken (the only reload speed bonus we both share), or just all reload speed bonuses.
---
The only ones that kinda annoys me is the wooden bases that are like 3x3 and has one ladder going up to the main building thats floating. I know why we did it so it was easy to move and defend. I just cant stand it not having supports. They could have a ok building iftheh made the lower foundation atleast 4x4 and use steel postsin the stair area to make it seem supported and just not floating.
---
Nice drop man! Hope your queen killings become easier with that beauty.
---
I haven't looked into myself but I would assume regular use of the drug will allow them to stay. They used to go away when you died but they recently fixed that.
---
It's definitely not the first one. :)
---
Shotguns, flechettes, and beam splitters all shoot 6 pellets/things. The total damage displayed is for all 6, but not necessarily the total damage they would do (because of DR, anti-armor, etc).
---
I don't remember when it was useful....
---
I sell shells at 2c and everything else at 1c. It all sells decently
---
Ammosmith doesn't need to be on all the time. I found bandelier to be necessary on mine.
---
Solid pve build, but i wouldnt use melee at all, use blocker for when they come at you with melee, and cannibal could be replaced aswell with fireproof to get explosive and fireresist if you trigger explosive traps or get a granade near you
---
Photographer is not bugged.
---
Musician definitely is.
---
It was useful when you wanted to destroy C.A.M.P.s more quickly.
---
Wow couldn‚Äôt reply for a while, some ‚Äúinternal server error‚Äù message.
---
Definitely interested, is your Gamer Tag same as username?
---
Most people usually find him outside the Charleston Train Station.  If there's a camp there then he won't spawn there.   I've run into him once on the road going north of Pleasant Point.  I don't know what his other spawn points are, maybe other players can chip in on those?
---
I did the same thing going from heavy melee to stealth non-automatic rifles. Ammo Smith doesn‚Äôt need to stay on unless you‚Äôre crafting.
---
I did something [like this](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=2f145fe&amp;d=sa1p02pd2pk2pl2pp2e00c72ic4a72ar2an2a04ao0lr2l71l12lk2lv2&amp;w=&amp;n=Cymids%20Rifleman&amp;m=) but I swapped two ranks of Critical Savvy for Class Freak. And I run rank 2 Gun Fu instead of full adrenaline.
---
"What have you brought upon this cursed land"
---
id recommend you to swap out ammosmith with two ranks of white knight and id highly suggest to get the backpack because sniper rifles are heavy i underestimated the carryweight problem on my sniper 
---
btw feel fre to contact me when you start as i usually have some cool low level sniper weapons legendarys or crafted ones id love to equip you every once in a while
---
Same with ammo smith, you can just equip it when you craft ammo and go with gunfu or adrenalin or both instead
---
Some weapons have limitations to possible legendary effects at second and third slot maybe it's the case here
---
Just some advice but the small supermutant camp next to the Whitesprings spawns a magazine almost every time. It's on a table in the shed.
---
Never knew that vendor was rare nor have unique stuff for safe.
---
I did it at golf club, I lured all ghouls then just bombard them from sky!
---
They're trying to gyp you.
---
Furious and Executioner aren't exactly optimal effects, but you could do far, far worse. I think your prices are fine (if a bit low for the 50cal, since I saw in another comment that you say it's weightless)
---
it does look likely that resetting your character to level 1 will spawn 4 and 5 star legendarys, but what will happen if a level 40 (non prestige) player turns up and kills a 5 star legendary you are fighting do they get a 5 star weapon as well because that would not go down well with players
---
It's not the console gamers....
---
Xbox and PS4 have USB support for keyboard and mouse. There's some Illuminati level conspiracy to never actually support them in an FPS, especially not one with PVP.
---
Maybe it's some weird fear that a $14 USB keyboard would be unfairly pay-to-win for a crowd that drops $200 on arcade sticks and $100 on skinned controllers.
---
inb4 gramps whines about "If I wanted a keyboard on my lawn I'd buy a Dell MAC PC Computer from Facebook" or whatever.
---
Idk your platform, but on PC you could just move them out of the screenshots folder.
---
I was wondering about this as I lost my veil ages ago, basically the mansion is a no go area from now on, not that bothered just seems annoying for part of the game to be totally dependent on a piece of clothing that are so easy to loose in the hundreds of times we go in and out of our inventory, moving things about.
---
Wow, you obviously thought this more through than I did. Some things they could even implement right away. I think it would be cool if they did a food/farm update because it is quite limited at this moment
---
I just used the fatman as a melee weapon while I was doing the 'kill x enemies in railway depot y'
---
For all these challenges (crossbow, flamer, fatman...) bash works a treat.
---
the owner has to be in camp for you to be able to inspect weapons
---
Use gun bash
---
From my experience the strangler pods become strangler bloom at night.
---
It may happen but you have a very low chance of 4* and an even lower chance of 5*
---
And yet we keep coming back for more, psychological mind games.
---
but all venders are at the whitesprings and they are unkillable
---
i just ran around in the forest bashing all low level mole rats to death after running out of nukes
---
Yes!
---
Wait. I think I misread OP as "did you get anything _*wood*_".
---
Patches the Hyena.
---
It's functionality hasn't changed. It's not directly nerfed. It's not indirectly nerfed.
---
If you've in PvP, it works exactly as intended. That's all of survival and PvP when people choose to or you contest a workshop.
---
Doesn't it suck that you can just randomly grief on people's camps with great efficiency? Poor baby.
---
My wife had two 3-star assaults on heads do that, and I think I had a junkie‚Äôs mole miner gauntlet do it as well, though I‚Äôm not certain on the gauntlet.
---
It‚Äôs ridiculous.
---
Gamma gun for the win, just shoot at your feet.
---
If they made 2 shot consume two bullets a shot, I think they could restore it to full double damage.
---
It'd be very strong again, but with explosive still nerfed and an actual cost to use it, it might be alright.
---
Hey neighbour!
---
I recommend putting your camp in high altitudes in the forest. From my experience I've had constant mothman visits ONLY when I do this. And I've moved my camp countless times.
---
they will need to add more legendary effects to the game for 4 star weapons to be worth resetting characters
---
It is not hard to make anonymous Reddit account and come here to do some "hidden marketing". Some companies have hired people for that purpose. It is not rare anymore. They pretend to be a gamers who have needs, but in true live they are working for the company and trying to increase revenues.
---
Omg that‚Äôs a game changer lol
---
Thanks you so much! I‚Äôm running a 50. Cal  TSE but also have a TS The Dragon. But i‚Äôm planning on making a new char to make a better build with the 50. Cal!
---
Nah. OP is right. This happens with items generated from the Purveyor.
---
Wood stuff is the most notable. A 3 star wood item is apparently not a valid item and reverts to 1 star after certain actions (trading to another player, relog...). Try it.
---
I guess this is a glimpse into how we used to get drills and one star wood armor from 3 star legendaries, etc. It seems the Purveyor has no rules about generating trash. Sort of surprised I haven't received a legendary drill that reverts to a normal item on relog yet.....
---
Wow. I need to find a 90% WR one right away!! Thanks!
---
Would you name yours Joe Biden?
---
*Braces for downvotes*

since some jerk downvoted probably thinking i am trolling check this

I think I'm the only one that seems to do the Imposter Sheepsquach event for the challenge.
---
Sometimes it works of there's a workbench close by. Otherwise I'm not sure how to squeeze through a window?
---
Don't hit them back or don't go into survival, duhüòÇ
---
Purveyor generated items are whacky. Relog, trade, and some other events cause Wood armor, etc, to "fix" themselves. Wood armor can never be 3 star, but if the Purveyor generated that.... You have a 3 star wood armor piece temporarily.
---
Gatling Guns, etc, that I've received have not reverted and have legit 3 star versions. The only issue there is sometimes they rename themselves for some reason.
---
I got one on day 1 of the legendary vendor with the WR so make sure you throw a few scrip in the direction of 3* ranged weapons, I know exactly what I‚Äôm doing with mine now...... shoot myself in the toes on purpose lol
---
With all the script that I've spent I'm tending to believe you it seems like all the prefixes have the same chance on appearing I'm sure Bethesda will fix this not enough nocturnal pieces in the world
---
LOL. We came from a meta that required multiple nerfs to explosive weapons and effects. Yeah, good luck...
---
As for the other stuff:
---
&gt; Cannonballs require 10 Lead but only give 2x Cannonballs without perks. Can we boost the amount or half the cost? 
---
10 lead also required to produce 12 .308 round. Do you think 12 .308 bullet heads would equal even 1 cannonball shot, let alone 2?
---
&gt; Baseball Grenades weight 1.0 and deal less damage than a Fragmentation Grenade that weights .5 (and is much easier to craft) 
---
How power or weight efficient do you think an -&gt; **improvised explosive** &lt;- is from a properly designed and manufactured one? Of course I'd expect it to be heavier and less powerful.
---
Awesome shitpost. 10/10. Thanks for the chuckle :)
---
I have a sneaking suspicion that if you were level 100 you would be angry you could one-shot a level 20.
---
I have a instigating swing speed super Sledge you can have if you need it
---
They cannot one hit kill you unless you‚Äôre in survival or unless you either shoot first or return fire. It‚Äôs your own fault if that‚Äôs happening. If you‚Äôre shooting people on accident then turn on pacifist mode so you cannot shoot people or objects owned by people.
---
Yeah didn't even notice that. I haven't done any camp buildings, only open space "camping" camps. I just admired that "raindeer", the spawn point for his camp was partially in that hole, so that was the first thing you see after you hurry up and try to jump out so you don't get stuck inside the foundation parts.
---
Saaaame i kept up so much biological hazards (and teddy bears o course)
---
Id love to have Sentry Bot as a server, trying to give you glass of wine, making the tables fly on ita way, breaking the table when placing the glass, commenting "hands useless, commencing cleanup protocole", and demolishing my bar completely.
---
Then dont play Survival if you're low level with shit gear
---
Hmmm... those are bugged too now?
---
When I got them they weren't, you had to 'consume' the plan to learn to craft the mod.
---
Sheepsquatch are absolute tanks, they have a ton of dr and hp. I have to reload a two shot 50 cal with full perks at least once fightig the lower level ones.
---
They‚Äôre not bugged. I have high capacity, refrigeration and armor plated and only high capacity was learned without actually using the plan. The others worked as you‚Äôd expect, use the plan to learn it and the plan disappears.
---
Awesome! Congrats!
---
Then I don't know what the OP means...
---
Supply and demand. I have matched my prices to demand. Things that don‚Äôt go I lower. Things that fly like hotcakes I raise.
---
I don‚Äôt sell weapons or armor though
---
I sell propaganda flyers for 49, so...
---
More than likely yes
---
If you‚Äôre not on Survival, go into your game settings and enable Pacifist Mode. If you‚Äôre in Survival, take your lumps and ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù or go back when you‚Äôre actually leveled to play the mode.
---
YES!!!
---
Is this even bait at this point?
---
Can't you change perk cards whenever you want to?
---
We've discovered what 'domestic kitchen tables' are now. They're the oval shaped tables with a light brown/yellow wood/particleboard top and thin blue legs. Grahm has them.
---
I ACTUALLY sell my stuff for 4-2000 caps. Don't get it why someone would buy stuff for 10k and more. I guess they just want to get rid of their caps... to get more caps in return just to get rid of them again... yeah.
---
Then my Anti-Armor Gauss Rifle would feel like itself again. They're certainly not as impressive as they were in previous Fallouts.
---
Salty boy: Dad!!, these guys keep bullying me!!

Dad: hold me beer.

On arrival...

Dad: wait, you mean in a game... Son, git gud.

They've actually removed a roll possibility before? Wonder why they never got rid of Stalker Melees then.

AA should just work with all damage type resistances though.

---
The pvp in this game is stupid but avoidable.
---
1. go to settings - game - set pacifist to ON - to avoid accidentally initiating combat.-if someone attacks you first and you attack back they can kill you. 
---
2. Claiming a workshop makes you eligible for pvp. to kill you all one has to do is go into the workshop area press the button for building pay 30 ish caps to contest and they can light you up.
---
3. if you see your tile and a rank number in lower right screen you have went into survival mode on accident and will be dead. 
---
4. if someone attacks you and you do not attack back they cannot hurt you. ever. they can only waste ammo - UNLESS you are in a team and a teammate initiated combat beware random invites your new friend may be someone elses old friend trying to set you up for a grief / gank.
---
5. I am level 230 in power armor and level 100 guys still come up and oneshot me. due to massive levels of duping in early game days there are a lot of people with god tier weapon and armor sets. combined with a good perk card set up, food, drugs,bobbleheads,magazines, etc  they can inflict 1000s of damage in a single hit. no matter your level or endurance you cannot survive it. 
---
6. bethesda has been responding to player feedback and culling back on the griefing mechanics avaidible - they removed slap damage, camps are now invulnerable, and the payout from dying in pvp is now down to 50 caps maximum. less and less incentive and ability to grief and pvp. now they should up the rewards in survival mode and tempt the pvpers into that mode somehow in my opinion.
---
stay frosty my friend 99% of the players in this game are really nice. dont let the 1%ers frustrate you to much.
---
Scrap that, bones are needed!
---
A little above the average. I'll go around with the intention of flipping some items if sold undervalued.
---
Managed to find a backpack mod and flipped it for around the he same price. I'll toss in super cheap or free stuff sometimes
---
The sheepsquatch at the events are easy to solo if it weren't for protecting the brahmins. But the wild ones you find randomly or legendary are bullet sponges and they don't aggro right away
---
Well they‚Äôre heavy and loud and annoying...
---
It doesn't happen often, but it does happen. I have seen her do the same thing. With 10 minutes to go, she flew off to the west, way out of the event area.
---
Toxic water
---
Perfect roll wood armor that reverts to one star after trade, relog, etc....
---
Can switchblades be 3 star? If not, immediately throw that in the grinder.
---
Mr handy farm event in flatwood.
---
I've been doing the same and have found one hide on one gulper....
---
Where would you say (even anecdotally) you found the most hides?
---
hmm we will have to battle test that. instigating is so easy to get around with a little rad damage though
---
I have a 2* Furious Gatling Plasma with 10% damage whilst aiming and it's a beast against tough enemies. GP already has very high damage so with Furious it melts, the rate of fire and great accuracy on the GL will make it pretty beastly too üòÅ
---
Pve in your pa
---
Nice! Can't wait to try mine out now.
---
Musician for sure but other ones are buggy as well. The atomic one says visist thunder mountain power plant. I did a repair thunder mountain event and it didn't register as complete
---
Besides the Slugger variants, Incisor, Martial Artist and Bloody Mess there's not much. Power User under Int let's you preserve cores when you're sprinting and power attacking.
---
On the armor itself you can get Optimized Bracers on the arms, to reduce power attack costs. Motion Assists on the torso give +2 strength.
---
If you want to dip in to low health builds, there's Radicool (Endurance), which is +5 strength when you're irradiated to the point of only having about 20% of you hp available. Nerd Rage (Intelligence) conveniently lines up with this, granting a rather sizeable damage buff (and some DR) while under 20%.
---
All classes of Power Armor also have a chest mod called Emergency Protocols, which halves the damage you take.... while under 20% HP. This makes you ridiculously tanky, so it's actually not particularly dangerous to hang out at 19% HP. (It increases your movement speed while on critical hp as well, but unfortunately there's a movement speed cap so it doesn't matter much)
---
At this point, of course, you'll also want a Bloodied weapon. A Bloodied/Swing Speed/Str+1 Super Sledge is ideal, but really any 1* bloodied 2hander will do in most cases.
---
It's worth mentioning that Non-PA melee has a vastly higher damage output, but is generally a lot squisher. (Unless you have perfect gear, then you just sort of win)
---
My friend was able to do it by standing in water- like the stream near the overseers camp, then firing an exploding weapon at his own feet.
---
I use a Gatling Plasma a lot and find that one in 3-4 "melted" enemies drop some in the goo pile. It's a steady flow and with the stuff from glowing creatures I have a surplus for making more Plasma Cores. 
---
Savage Divide area has a lot of glowing creatures like Molerats, hounds, wolves, and various bugs.
---
You can do with explosives but you need to make sure you're at a distance from the shot so that it only does a small amount of dmg otherwise you'll die automatically
---
Jump from the right height with the right amount of radiation
---
I swap in Armorer 3 all the time to add Ultra Light to things I want to keep. Unfortunately I was recently cursed with an Armorer 1 card from a perk pack. I can't delete it despite a Rank 1 having no value at all when I own a Rank 3. I been used to popping up perk menu and finding it as first card in my INT list for so long that I keep accidentally clicking the rank 1 card and wondering why Ultra Light is grayed out before remembering. It's annoying.
---
I'm also tired of needing to remove two cards and put on White Knight and and Fix It Good to repair my armor that still breaks too often and Weapon Artisan for fixing weapons. Lockpicking and Hacking I often skip because I get bored of swapping them in all the time.
---
Hard to tell... I haven't been 'writing it down' and memory is notoriously unreliable.
---
I distinctively remember getting one from a Super Mutant meat bag while objectively knowing that this is impossible unless another player puts it there in the first place.
---
Sorry I can't be of much help but I know that if I start keeping 'proper track' of this I am going to give up. I need the uncertainty so I don't completely crush hope under the weight of overwhelming evidence.
---
Damn some guys like you are so hardcore.
---
Anyway that's really impressive , and really lots of work you put into it, to share it with us. Double plus good work.
---
Although I play a lot, my gameplay is quite casual, so Im not being able to get much out of that. I just scroll the map and warp in on events whenever I feel like doing them, or I just scour and loot some low level(relative to me) areas and spend a lot of time killing non-legendaries of all kinds. I never walk by any level 5 radroach I can see with vats, and I really never not loot any low level enemy even if it only gives some low class meat I already have a lot of.
---
&gt;For me the biggest takeaway here is that you should learn all the prime receiver recipes you get, because it seems to guard against getting duplicates. Again, not enough data here to confirm it, because my main apparently still has prime plans to learn, but I'm pretty confident in it (call it a p value of "it's probably fine").
---
Yeah I still recently got few prime receivers, because I haven't been super keen on doing the queen. I think I've learned all ultracite parts ages ago, I also think you get some/most of them with the last BOS quest, which I haven't done with my main or alt. And I don't remember when I last got ultracite plan.
---
So I think you are very correct about that, I don't recall getting duplicate prime plans I haven't learned yet, and ultimately they aren't really worth anything like neither are ultracite plans , because people farm SBQ so much, and you can get them for free anytime any large group does SBQ.
---
&gt;(particularly since Heart of the Enemy was only recently fixed to trigger properly).
---
I think it shows up, yes, but I've not been able to do it, the terminal you need to analyze the scortchbeast sample seems to be bugged. Unless it's been fixed in last week or so. I tried it twice like last week, when it was showing up.
---
&gt;Distant Thunder is awesome and fun, but my main character is a stealth sniper, so it's pretty much a lock. It's also one of the few events I've seen that'll award the plans to make T-51b pieces, though I've just had one drop in 10 tries.
---
I've now several times had distant thunder to activate on the train yard west of Watoga, and there's things like a lot of scourched, fighting maybe super mutants, BUT, as bonus a legendary sheepsquat.
---
&gt;Countdown [Silo] isn't really about the quest reward, I know. But at least hit me up with The Usual, or a better chance at some oddball recipes. It is, however, the only place I've ever seen the Disease Cure (Cranberry Bog) recipe drop, and it also dropped the Stimpak recipe once.
---
I've got several times stimpack recipe from somewhere else with my main. Sold then in vending for few hundreds, I doubt it's really rare or valuable to mention, as the crafting is too expensive. Of course players who don't have it, buy them, but then they see the recipe and don't craft them anyway. 
---
&gt; Why go back into Blackwater Mine?
---
With high level char, you get several legendaries, nearly guaranteed at least 2 star and often a 3 star plus maybe another 2 star. Then you can haul all that shit back while overemcumbered to station, to sell normal weapons for caps, and recycle the legendaries for scrip. The recycled mine suit parts also give a huge load of gears and black titanium to sell directly to vendor bot.
---
&gt;Protest March never feels worthwhile, but that's largely due to a (perhaps fixed?) b
---
I've now do it a lot with my level 18 mule, because she has a base up there in north with junk and lead collector, and I often travel or start at grafton ST. I often get Grafton monster and right after that protest march, they are trivially easy and the protest has been working perfectly at least a month, probably longer. So I'd say it's completely fixed.
---
&gt;The Path to Enlightenment always seems to spawn with 4 minutes left and nobody else around.
---
Yeah I was like level 150 when I was finally bagged it once as succesfully, and saw the peaceful monthman, which to my surprise was also immortal :( I think I've only completed it once. Failed plenty.
---
&gt;Free Range 
---
&gt; That said, if you're alone it really sucks, and if you kill the cows after the quest finishes, then you really suck. Also lol at this reward screen I got in particular.
---
What do you mean by the brahm, is it bad somehow to kill them AFTER? I mean I kill them for meat of course.
---
Also I think Ive had non-event for same thing near the Big Fred Barbaque, some robot was hearding some named brahm, and sheepquat showed up to attack them. It seemed milder, but god that's really tanky thing to kill alone, even though it is mostly harmless and just cause you to slowly use stimpacks. I have to rain it a lot with AA E handmade to kill it, it's stagger/slowdown is bad againts my vats crits Im trying to farm. 
---
&gt;Guided Meditation
---
It seems nearly guaranteed to have a 3 star as last boss. Maybe not but I've mostly got it. It's good when you can deal super mutants effectively. They require some sweet anti armor guns or good melee, or maybe good energy weapons. Don't want to go there with medicore guns as their damage resistance can suck up a lot of of damage.
---
&gt;Workshop Quests
---
I've done a fuckton of these. Whenever it's someone elses workshop, you are competely safe, so I really love those. But if you don't feel like it, you can always leave. 
---
Players taking any workshop should always build it up using blueprinted towers or such, using all common materias that workshops have plenty, so that the workshop claim/contesting price goes up to max of 100 caps. I find towers easiest as all workshop can easily build them. Lots of wood, steel, plastic, cloth ect. Over the past changes workshop griefing has become more and more difficult. It's pretty good now.
---
Often when there's few critters left on workshop defense wave, you can see their location on map, if they are reluctant to attack. 
---
&gt; The Fixer, which is just a godsend to stealth-rifle characters
---
It is really any that good? I haven't tried to craft combat rifle to compare and I don't have the plans yet, I heard someone claimed it does extra damage, but none of the listed affects say that, o I was thinking he was just mistaking the better receiver it has than maybe what he could craft. I've tried initially seling the level 30 I got for 400 caps, no buyers, still trying at 200 caps. If it were any good surely someone would have brought it.
---
[Queen]
---
&gt;Some improved repair kits.
---
Those are amazingly handy. Im hauling a lot of shit with my excavator. I also use the weight glitch that goes away if I craft anything or for whatever reason leave the PA, which I think alone is worth 100 lbs. But that can be resumed by chancing server. But if any single excavator part gets fully broken, typically a leg, then I lose like 200 (or even 250?) llbs of carry weight, and only repairing the part, then changing server, fixes that. And there are places where nearest PA station can be really far away, in hostile terratory. Those advanced repair kits are amazing at fixin excavator on the fly. If I've had none, I'd buy at least few normal repair kits to have then on standby for the excavator, even if it's 50 atoms a piece, because those are really great when you most need them. But with advanced repair kit I don't even need to bother to make full repairs later on, as 150% is pretty close to 200% anyway.
---
&gt;bother with Jail Break and Patrol Duty
---
Jail Break is still nice. Patrol duty seems a bit slow, but I do them if Im around, and I see other players too.
---
What about fever blossoms?
---
&gt;What more could you want?
---
Yeah it's good. It also goes pretty fast so maybe that's why not always someone is there.
---
Ramp up your rads so you have nearly no hp then frag grenade yourself. Make sure you have aquaboy/girl equipped else the rad damage will kill you when critically injured.
---
Ive found 1 hide in a box and I have yet to of checked exactly what I have, but I was luckily collecting magazines for incase I can display and I think I have atleast 4 of the unstoppables on my alt
---
There is definitely a cap. I can't remember exactly what it was, but a long time ago I remember not getting any use out of anything over 14, I think.
---
The easiest way to boost INT for crafting is to find some Unyielding armor and just irradiate yourself.
---
Armor durability is near pointless - you/everyone will eventually get Brotherhood modded legendary heavy combat armor and never wear a crafted item again.
---
Melee weapons benefit, but see above ....
---
I think power armor at one time got a crafting bump but Power Patcher and Fix It Good makes it kind of meh.
---
TL;DR it's ultimately pointless whatever the cap is.
---
*Can you feel ze schadenfreude now, dummkopf?*
---
I just got mine at 400+ hrs in, level 120ish.
---
The usual with fries, I guess. This killed me. This post is some of the best content that currently exists regarding 76 and makes me want to actually come back and play a bit. Well done.
---
Rads and Explosives can take too much health, you don't want to die, but be downed (1-5% health?).
---
If a big drop kills you instantly, about 3 stairs high, try using 2 and a jump (no marsupial).
---
Just keep cherry tapping yourself (small damage, not anything perverted), and you'll get there.
---
&gt;I've gotten the Super Stim recipe from Countdowns twice now, having played since b.e.t.a.
---
I think I've also gotten two, and only like last week or so. But they are apparetnly like T-60 jetpacks, not worth really anything. Oh wait I've never done silos or launched nukes, but I've definetlely got two from somewhere, and it's apparently common now.
---
Completely understand. I'm 100% certain I got one from a Gulper but I am also questioning my own sanity now that I'm on Gulper #3,961,237
---
No but in order to dupe. The dupers crash the servers. That is my main point for hating people who dupe.   
---
Me: Oh I just spent 40 minutes fighting through a silo. Just launched the nuke.  
---
Duper:  Sorry bud, but I have stuff to dupe, let me crash the server for you.  
---
Me: FUC\*\*\*G Bastards
---
Thanks, Im missing that plan, even seen players over and over on trade discorc to spesifically asking it.
---
Swollen green asshole.....you should have a doctor look at that...
---
Is that sledge 2*?
---
The trick is not to jump in water that's deep enough to swim in. If you die submerged you cannot be revived.
---
If you go to Spruce Knob where the swimming challenge is and take a running jump off the building near the speaker box where the quest starts.... You should be able to land with your toes in the edge of the water. That's all you need.
---
Is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I share these dreadful news with you: only the magazines you 'pick up in the wild' count.
---
Trading them, picking them up from a paper bag, buying them from a vending machine... doesn't count.
---
Thank you very much. We did it üòäüëèüèº
---
Yes instigating and 40% swing speed
---
I don't think that's the case.
---
In skyrim you could turn a skill to legendary. That would reset it and allow you to keep on leveling.
---
We'll probably have a similar system. There were even some perk cards data mined. 
---
Locking 4/5* behind a pvp gate is really unlikely, Bethesda knows that this isn't a pvp game at heart and doing that it will annoy pretty much all pve players. 
---
If i'm to speculate on 4 and 5 stars legendary that's probably reserved for future unique items. Example: new dungeon, the big bad boss drops a 4/5* item. You know, the same system that's in place in any mmo.
---
Yup learned the hard way. Lol thank you very much. Done it now üòä
---
Oh really? Damn. That may be problematic
---
Thank you very much! üòä
---
SAVED!
---
Yeah I've got plenty of unyielding pieces and a (almost) complete set of unyielding +1 int. Just wondering if its worth it to reset my mutations (remove marsupial) and craft some sets or if the same result can be achieved with what I have now.
---
Damn, I just checked and I have them all. So it won't help me.
---
When I tried to initiate PvP it instantly killed us. Managed to do it. Thank you very much! üòä
---
Thank you very much!!! üòä

So far, mostly Chinese. Things are cheap and we make a lot of Clothing and Items.

Dog Food seems to be the main thing I sell, nobody wants guns or drugs, or guns that shoot drugs...

Although, Commie Whackers are starting to sell, take from that what you will.

How where when
---
Thank you so much!!! üòä
---
Ok thanks
---
Sorry. I‚Äôm confused lol. What do you mean?
---
I did this with a random guy after teaming up at the camp... were were doing the swarm of suitors and I tried to drown myself... which was a no go. So we went to Grafton Dam and baited the super mutants... but the water is toxic and we died from rads (no chance of revival with that) or died whilst trying to revive the other one...
---
Queue solution... headed south to the steam by the airport and baited the scorched into fighting with us on the bank. We're would be just in the water they would melee us to death. Sure there are better spots to get some scorched or mutants with guns to kill you in a clean water.... think the mystery quest mansion has clean water and 4 or 5 scorched spawn outside.
---
All in all was a good laugh... and don't forget to remove armour and perks!!
---
Most areas are void of content. You can walk for 5 10 mins without finding anything to interact. So fun right
---
Oh sorry. I put the reply on a wrong comment.
---
Did you end up working it out
---
They can so OP is safe on that regard.
---
I didn't know however that wood armor did that... damn!
---
I have - or should I say 'had'? - a 3\* weightless\\ap regen\\sentinel wood leg that I immediately 'muled' for future use. Dreading to check the mule after work.
---
We did a similar thing at the gulper lagoon!!!! Thank you very much. Good tip to make sure to remove all armor. I also suppressed my mutations so bird bones and other mutations didn‚Äôt kick in.
---
LOL I saw people on EBay selling caps. 20,000 for $60
---
Stingwing Barbs are protected for some reason (Syringer Mod?), so I agree the rest should be.
---
Lol I was nearly max caps several months ago, brouht a T-60 jetpack plan because for nuke zones I was using it, so I thought it was "useful". Elsewhere I used normal armor. Never crafted one because you don't quite need jetpack anyway in nuke zones, and I wasn't even using marsupine because I didn't know how highly effective and cool that is. But then little later I finished Excavator quest, crafted and started using that, and only when I was selling my T-60 I crafted my first jetpack on it as the buyer wanted that. Maybe helped to sell the suit. Totally wasted 10k or whatever caps it took.
---
Ultimately any such expensive plan, is not worth buying. It's so much cheaper to pay someone else to craft any part you want. I know that now.
---
And jetpacks drop often with imposter sheepsquat. Like half the time, or over. Everybody doing it at all, has several. Yet some people try to sell them for 3k. Or 1k. Heh, good luck with those prices.
---
No worries! I get confused a lot lol. We did. Going to gulper lagoon with a team mate and letting the gulpers beat us up in the water.
---
This sounds like a really nice idea. They could deck out several of the stations into small robot hubs, change a few bigger ghost towns into ones inhabited by wierd robots, even give us more quests focusing on Watoga and the seemingly infinite number of bots it pumps out.
---
There are a few items. The ones people noticed first were Wood armor and Assaultron Head weapons.
---
Wood can only be 1 star. Assaultron can only be 2. I'm not sure what else is in the limited pool. :\
---
The good news is your 3 star purchase now has very little trade-in value as a one star to help you milk the last few scrips out of the grinder..... :\
---
If you pay me 5000 caps a day ,I can slowly repair  all you're damaged items ....
---
The place I work is called " Handy Home"  ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Morgantowns good in a hurry, if you need 10-20 or so.
---
Frat Row has a lot of Board Games, Big Al's has some loose, I'm sure VTU has some about too.
---
But things like Rad Poker, Blast Radius, and Volatile Material Box all contain Nuclear Material.
---
Saldy no.
---
Damn! You are right!
---
I have checked the esm and the Wood Armor only has the 'ap\_Legendary1' attach point, WTF?
---
When I got a 3\* from her I assumed they had changed the records as to include #1 to #5.
---
I don't even understand how on earth I got 3 'legendary effects' from a single attach point.
---
I guess 'assume makes an ass of u and me' is still current.
---
Some cards are useful at lower levels depending on how much room you have. I often use a Makeshift Warrior 2 + First Aid 3 to slow down things breaking a bit and mainly use the 5 for crafting. I have a Lone Wanderer 1 I use with Travel agent when I don't feel like swapping it out constantly and a Lone Wanderer 2 for bosses (only have 3 CHR max). Thru-Hiker 2 because I can't fit 3 but it still reduces weight a lot. 
---
But there're many that serve no purpose at lower ranks that do nothing in combat or survival. Picklock, hacker, science, contractor, scrapper, fix it good, chemist, weapon artisan, science master, hard bargain, travel agent, ammosmith etc. They don't actively effect combat/gameplay and just get swapped in and out constantly when needed.
---
all legendaries get scrapped unless capped in which case they get sold for whatever the vending machine default price is. seeking 1 specific 3 star legendary lasergat the rest are nothing to me. power armor user only so legendary armor doesn't matter. all of it is sold or scrapped. 
---
all drugs are 5 c per except for the lessers and diluteds which are 1 c per. superstims 15 per.
---
all notes are trash and thrown to the ground unless they're somewhat rare. all treasuremaps sell for 25 c
---
all junk is sold for 1 c per I keep 100 of each. anything extra gets chunked on the vendor or sold to the npc merch. 
---
all ammo not fusion core is sold for 1 c per all grenades are 5 c per.
---
I stock stock stock then someone will come along and clean me out of a lot of stuff for thousands at a time. I actually had a guy fast travel to me to thank me for running my vendor the way I did because he needed 5mm and I had a couple thousand for 1c per. I have never been thanked for running a vendor before. it was cool. 
---
I could probably make more but I am kind of beyond needing a whole lot of anything. even if I do get capped out on caps there's only one legendary weapon I want. if i dont get it I am happy with my little 1 star vampires laser gat.
---
ALL in all I like having my vendor. its a way of making extra caps and I can sell ammo and provide a service for people now. profits are good over all.
---
I have had a lot of fun with my assassins dragon... but now it sits in my stash whilst I try out sole survivor and other interesting stuff... I may come back to it at some point so it is valuable to me and that is why it is up for 10k... on the other hand, mole miner gauntlet plan... *meh*... 10 caps
---
Was that before or after they reduced great many different ways to do unvanted PvP? It might affect into things. Anyway yeah the legendaries are pretty okay, I think I've like always seen 3 star bloated ghoul there somewhere. It might not even require the event.
---
The candy is totally worthless though. I collected 5k and got some stupid mr handy buzzsaw.
---
I would honestly not be suprised if they've already "fixed" it. I spent another 900 scrip today and got 40% nocturnal pieces and no explosive/crit weapons whatsoever.
---
Grafton Vendor seems to have all 3: Short, Medium and Long, but not always at the same time.
---
So far no luck but my friend got a Tse handmade
---
Didn't sell anything. Event reward plans or rare plans like s'mores and fixer , medium to good gun, legendary scout armor, for an avarage of 1500 caps.....nothing.at all.
---
Like i thought this vending thing is useless. I'm just gonna sell stuff on reddit as always,get more caps and actually sell them.
---
To be fair, you'd kind of assume someone would've noticed this before launch...... ;)
---
Congrats! now ya just gotta apply the third claw mod to it.
---
Also, seriously, to hell with the people in these imgur comments.
---
Can't tell them anything or they'll put it in the atomic shop
---
This happened to me last night. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve submitted a ticket as it kept asking me to d/l launcher.
---
Fair suggestion, to make it immortal like Grahm.
---
It can easily die on it's own too. Once I grabbed it and tried to keep it still by having the trade screen open, and it just exploded. I don't know why. If some player shot it, I didn't see the player, or hear any silenced shot.
---
Thx man. Im ps4
---
Go Dave!
---
It wasn‚Äôt a Purveyor item, it was a loot from one of WestTec super mutants ...
---
tHE CIRCLE IN THE TOP LEFT IS JUST A TEMPORARY THING, THAT TELLS YOU THAT SOMEONE HAS SHOT ONE OFF, BUT IT'S NOT LAUNCHED UP INTO THE AIR YET.
---
oNCE IT IS AIRBORNE, THE RED CIRCLE IS PLACED IN THE CORRECT SPOT.
---
I've been extremely lucky with around 1800 caps I'll test today and I'll post back in this thread I know it's random and my sample size is small
---
This happened to me last night. My camp wasn‚Äôt even in the world and I was nowhere near where my camp normally is.
---
You haven't been keeping an eye on this sub though, have you? Otherwise you would know how dumb it is to post this.
---
[try here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the)
---
How do I get on these servers? (Xb1)
---
I found your camp last night but I couldnt seem to get my Mike to work. Level 30 armor takes ballistic fiber 4 per piece. I have heavy chest and one arm in my inventory for you and need to mine this one spot and server hop to find more and finish your armor. I also made you a BOS underarmor that gives +2 Str and +2End. I will be back soon and finish up your set. Sorry for the Mike fritz.
---
My initial batch was 50+ ranged weapons and it seemed to be completely random (as in equal chances). My last 9 weren't as great tho as I've mentioned, but that might just have been RNG
---
I really could do with a speaker that plays the following when someone gets near my vending machine, in the voice of ED-209 of course;
---
"You have 20 seconds to come-buy ..."
---
Hell yes - come to my shop. buy my stuff. go make more caps and rinse repeat.900 hours still having fun with this dumb ,broken, glitchy, sometimes annoying game. :P
---
Nope, it was airborne &amp; the circle was still on top left corner, in my case. Maybe logging in while the countdown is halfway is a bad idea since it takes a min or two for everything to load due to slow server.
---
What platform are you on (if you haven't already turned it in for scrip)?
---
The blooms come from the same thing in the world that the pods do- the pods grow on the trees, and then sometimes they bloom into flowers.
---
Heart of the Swamp will bloom all the Pods into Blooms, and I don't think you have to even go and do it, just has to be activated in the world/on the map.
---
I got a handful yesterday, cuz my camp is in the mire sorta near-ish to there, so I check it kinda frequently.
---
I thought AHAB should have been the boss fight for the end of the burrows.
---
Or some cool free states robot with some of the newer weapons
---
I have pretty much ever other magazine in the game now, but not unstoppables 1 &amp; 4. 
---
Have 1 hide, which I found when I wasn‚Äôt looking for it, but no luck on any others.
---
The game engine can't handle it. Even the player movement speed is limited to one boosting perk/mutation at a time.
---
anybody tried using a decon shower in a nuke zone would it keep you from dying?
---
Brilliant idea. Deployment would be tricky as you don't want him easily taken out by LVL 68 SMs of the like. Would have to be limited to your stash too I imagine.
---
Jesus I wish. I really need to trade in some stuff and hit the purveyor
---
I was thinking new Atom Store ‚ÄòNot-pay-to-win‚Äô honest, items; camp repair kits and improved camp repair kits!
---
if you dont want to pvp (ie: friendly fire) then turn it off in the options once you reach level 5 or higher
---
This,
---
Plus I have a lot of stuff to sell so some of it is priced low just to get rid of it and make space
---
Where is your camp? I‚Äôm collecting these. Do you have the ones with the red text?
---
we need
---
crying 
---
laughing
---
face palm

and finally your mic hurts my ears where your player lies on the ground holding the sides of their head
---
They definitely missed a trick not making the robots more unique.
---
I main a sneak-based unarmed build with a little moonlighting on pistols, same as I've done since fallout was a mostly text- based game xD. I don't claim to be an authority, but here are my suggestions for an unarmed build (sneak optional): 
---
A. Damage
---
1. Iron fist is your only real flat damage increase perk besides bloody mess so go for that, for sure.
---
2. Bloody mess. (I don't use it because I can't afford the points, but definitely very good).
---
3. Incisor is your best friend
---
4. Martial artist is also really good, but not as important since, ideally, you'll only need one or two good swings. If you AREN'T wanting to sneak though, a definite must have. 
---
4. Ninja. Presuming you're sneaking anyway. This is the reason you only need one or two hits. 
---
B. Defense
---
1. Barbarian is a must have if you go maximum strength. Huge benefits.
---
2. Blocker is often recommended if you're looking to min/max your options. I like traveling pharmacy too much though. 
---
3. Ironclad is the BEST.  You can't wear power armor so... might as well right?
---
4. Evasive. Again, I use sneak so... my agility is always topped out. I use dodgy too though, so... 
---
5. Lone Wanderer. If you play solo, this is a great pickup. If not, bodyguards is acceptable, but not really neccessary. 
---
Extra Credit
---
Mutations are a huge part of a truly shining unarmed build. Must haves:
---
Damage
---
1. Talons. All day every day. 
---
2. Twisted Muscles
---
Defense
---
1. Grounded 
---
2. Scaly skin
---
I usually use class freak and/or strange in numbers when possible. This set-up at peak performance will let you sport 200+ resistances without ANY armor (because in nuke zones, you will have to be wearing a hazmat suit) and roughly 300 or so per punch from a deathclaw gauntlet. I run a hodgepodge of armor pieces based on what I did or didn't feel like repairing on a given day and usually end up in the 350-450 resistance range when not in my hazmat.  That is reasonably comparable to power armour, I think. 
---
Note: I didn't post my full build I just tried to hit the important parts. Personal flair in a build is important.
---
The robot construction platform is in 76. It was used in the Shear Terror quest. I too would like to see some use. Even a little robot companion. *gasps* ed-e!
---
Toilet in X3 right I sell them for a few caps sometimes people buy them from my camp
---
Yeah me too, especially after the 3rd time in a row that my nuke killed me too.
---
The only time I have encountered a wendigo in the back was during a quest when you had to kill the progenitor wendigo to get the gourmand's key
---
You dirty duper! üòÇ
---
If you drop it for a low level, you might mess up their version of the quest, so they can't craft the parts.
---
Either scrap it, or donate to somebody who has already done, or won't be doing, Miner Miracles.
---
Shhhh! This is my best kept secret! This is how my rifleman deals with being swarmed by ghouls
---
Weapons factory would be the least likely to be added if any where as they need to be consumable things
---
Those areas are the weak spots in the map though, if the game was built to make vehicles useful you'd have to fill the whole map with areas like that on purpose.
---
Yeah shooting at feet with an explosive weapon doesn't work. You don't go into revive mode. You just straight up die.
---
Same I also do the Poseidon plant for fusion cores
---
Keeping an eye on this sub yet missed all the hundreds of posts asking the same question?
---
As enticing of an idea of giving my info to a true neck beard seems, I think I‚Äôll pass.
---
The Purveyor is going to be like the XUR of fallout 76. I bet they will even change her location from time to time and we need to find it.
---
me too so if you need decent gear im happy to help out you may need to help with basic ressorces like steel or plastic but otherwise i wouldnt charge you
---
feel free to check my account so you get an idea of what i could craft but expecially on rifles i have quite a variety that coulf suit you well üëçüèº
---
Can seem to find Sweet roll recipe anywhere. Whitespring vendor doesn't have it. Anyone found it anywhere else? Thanks in advance
---
Heart of the Swamp event has to have been started or completed on a server to get them to spawn. It's not a bug, you just have to keep relogging to find a server where it has happened
---
Ps4
---
Didn't think about that... Scrap is the only option Thx.
---
Thats an opinion.
---
Nice compilation of wasteland dwelling's!
---
Still need it bro? I need it as well!
---
Yes I do. DeathBladeFX, you can add me. I‚Äôm online now
---
Selling them to a NPC vendor and buying them back has worked on things like technical data so may be worth a try (As long as vendor cost is not crazy)
---
Well, as a recreational chemist I offered him some vintage nukashine and he hit the paper bag with his club. So I had no choice but to violently discharge him AMA with my shotgun.
---
But my mic is in an unknown location, so I can‚Äôt talk)
---
Name a single game that combines vehicle and on foot gameplay where there aren't distinct wide open "vehicle areas" that you should never be in on foot.
---
Gauss rifle wouldn't be changed by this anti-armour fix. The Gauss rifle, while an energy weapon, deals ballistic damage and so benefits from the anti-armour perk.
---
How about putting them in a container for another player
---
To be honest they should just change the build area to a square instead of a circle.
---
Nope, doesn't work either.
---
Are you up the hill in the next pond? I was there for a week or so while I debated the merits of Behemoth husbandry. Ultimately that pond lost out as I just couldn't find a suitable spot for large amounts of crops that also allowed easy access to water. The brook at my current plot solved that nicely.
---
The fact that it can hold 300 per magazine also is just incredible.
---
Im just salty that I need to use semi-auto rifles instead of auto-rifles if i want the most damage
---
 I worked hard to earn the 5000 caps it cost me to buy the Hunters Long Coat from a player vendor. I‚Äôm not sure whether I got a good deal or not though...
---
its because the engine is old
---
Does the coat have a chance to spawn in the world or is that where the vendor can be?
---
I‚Äôve got a full set of Ultracite Power Armour in my stash and I‚Äôve got no idea where from.üòÇ
---
Liberator could give you a special artillery and grenades with a green smoke trail, when you throw it it takes a couple seconds then fires a volley of 3 liberators if they hit anything they do a ton of ballistic damage but its hard to actually hit anything because its in a radius. After they land they will assist you until they die (they probably wont last long though) then add a 20 minute cooldown between summons and make it unable to work if you have any active still
---
My first permanent mutation was Healing Factor, and here's my summary:
---
It is not active in combat, its just a free health regen when you're out of it. That's not too bad in a game like this where you'd otherwise have to use aid items to heal. 
---
Do consider there are similar perk options (though they are conditional) such as Ghoulish+Sun Kissed/Rad Sponge and the weather/CAMP dependant ones.
---
The chem debuff is rough, FYI it effects stimpaks too, which you'll still want for when you're in combat. Class Freak counters this but requires 3 points, which is a hard sell if you only want the 1 mutation (but a good investment if you have several). First Aid Lvl1 on top cancels it out.
---
Overall its a Upper Tier mutation on an accomodating build and a Low Tier mutation otherwise.
---
Meanwhile I'm getting 1 star wooden armor all the time from SBQ...
---
So U Lend of sell that capacity plan?
---
Have you found the plasma grenade plan yet I've been searching for it for the past week and have not found it
---
Nah. U can get it from a safer site made for this sort of thing. It's 20,000 caps  for $20.00 US
---
Not all of us have the means to build a nice place...
---
It doesnt affect melee distance wish it did I would love to teleport in and kill something from 30 feet away not sure about guns though
---
Same here , pretty much giving stuff away. Dense chest mods , rarer plans &amp; stuff. Almost nothing sells.
---
I just farm them at the Vault so I can drop at random camps I visit
---
Lmao
---
Oh yeah. In my mind it's still something you need to manage because it could run you out of various junk items by doing repairs. So you would still need the same types of junk as if you repairing yourself.
---
When you have completed the scout event and gotten the backpack, does this  dailys  give scout or possum badges ?
---
You do need plans but you are given them from completing the initiation quest I‚Äôm pretty sure
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand we salute you back sir. Truly you are a survivor who can stand amoungst your peers as one of the truly accomplished.
---
For me? Honestly not really. Pretty much everything I got was a heavy weapon, besides one bloodied pipe pistol, which is also not very good
---
U don‚Äôt need plans, got it and haven‚Äôt completed first tadpole quest
---
You want one .. ü§£ü§£
---
south of monangah there is an excellent build-able area - its like a hunting lodge with full buildings deco and everything. seriously tempted to move there myself but I am addicted to my junk node. pretty sure there was some hanging radstags there, its just outside of the building bubble for the workbench - i found it because i was looking for something close to monongah at the time - didnt build there because it had no fresh water -
---
It could be a new feature added by the fall updates, as the picture [here](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/57rzdd8RrXf5hNuIF3ofZJ/5e77803a3f8a7c43259a1b1f672ec2ff/Fallout76_RoadMap_2018_02-21_FINAL.PNG) looks like a robot companion.
---
I've seen him once, but he was dead.  It was the bug/feature that causes instant death to surrounding enemies and such.
---
Then again, I tend to just not try finding him now because I've heard of situations like OP's or see people's base built there.
---
Cheers man ill check it out right now!!
---
hmm maybe it was north. go to monongah - get your camp out and go around the bubble for the workshop there - the buildings are pretty big and in really good condition - no spawn when i was there but I didnt live there so you never know.
---
And Protectrons on Treads, don't remember seeing them before Automatron, but they're in 76 too.
---
Gotta feed my heavy guns somehow. Delicious steel.
---
14 bought so far...14 absolute god rolls...nah just messing with you. 14 shit items
---
Sent you a chat message
---
Question : For the 'kill enemy x with weapon y' parts of the badge, do you actually need to use the weapon required from start to end or is it enough if you do the killing strike with the required weapon ?
---
yeah pretty sure its south of those coolant towers.
---
Excellent, thanks!
---
I wont be on until Monday but add me I play daily. My GT EzGrooveRider..
---
I've got extra T-51 plans and need T-60 ones and the game seems insistent on not giving me them.
---
Yea, im concerned about guns/rifles, got myself a sweet crossbow with Stalker + limb 50% dmg + reloadspeed, and if stalkers works as i understand it would be awsome if no matter how far away i am as long as i can vats the enemie its a guarantied hit, i could vats thier limbs and head 100% +50% limbdmg without missing the shots in vats when im hidden and caution. Thats how ive want it to work, but it doesnt...
---
I‚Äôll never say no to free power armor!
---
Perfect for stealth and sneakbuilds
---
harpers ferry - swamp - bridge foundation makes a good base foundation point. multiple good locations for water farming. also anywhere near thunder mountain.
---
Unlikely. I have a lvl 45 Furious Handmade with 55% rifleman and 15% bloody mess doing 100 damage/shot. The same goes for my Mutant slayer's and Hunter's Handmade. My lvl 35 Zealot's Handmade does 89 damage/shot. So you either have different levels or have the *250 DR while reloading* bug.
---
If you read what I posted, you're presenting the example of the Gambler's Fallacy, the events are independent.
---
Anywhere along the main river in the forest
---
Oh ok, then I guess you can craft them as soon as you finish talking to the scout leader at the camp for the first time
---
Did you report them? If you didn't then, sorry but you failed in your duty as a '76 citizen/resident. Seriously if no one reports idiots like these then they will think  they can act with impunity, their actions don't affect anyone else and they may never learn to grow up and move out of their Mommy's basement. There are people out there who are not fit to exist within any collective and we have to educate or eliminate them .... or everyone suffers. As an aside i am REALLY sorry you had to have this experience with your son as a witness. I hope he is old enough to understand the immaturity of some people.
---
170 is not a very high dmg number...im at over 600 with a hunting , so 600 √ó 2.5 from stealth  and feels like nothing happens.
---
What name are you trying to use?
---
Vampires explosive railway rifle and furious Gatling plasma are the two best out of 10 three star weapons...
---
Yeah to be honest we didn't remember to switch it off after we hit level 5, the whole shooting was an accident. Just thought I'd make a joke from a bad situation.
---
Quest reward. You probably got a raider set too if you did Rose's quest.
---
I'm gonna guess you know about The Whitespring?
---
You could try the Burrows, Harper's Ferry or West-Tek, they seem to be popular.
---
Watoga was nerfed  (I think certain Buildings can still spawn them, just not on the streets).
---
Or if you can launch a Nuke, that might cause a few to spawn.
---
Dude you are the impersonation of everything I love about Reddit...mad props m8 :D
---
Dang, are you always hungry and thirsty?
---
Being honest I payed 200 for one recently because I'd never seen it before and thought it looked cute when you got all those caps 200 isn't much I can farm that many from weapon sales in 15 minutes
---
Sorry.  It's allready scrap
---
whats the date range of your codes? could it be in the process of changing to next weeks codes?
---
WOW! I had no idea this magnificent madness existed. It recalls memories of what Asians do to their trucks, Tuk Tuks and other vehicles.
---
Yeah, but you need to use them, not just pick them up.
---
I actually found the opposite the last couple of nights lol. Barely got a legendary
---
Another valuable event can be uranium fever. Sometimes it spawns three 3 star movement which is useful as not far from the event is a legendary scripper
---
The other comments were funny, but yours is the best and most helpful üòâüëç
---
Remember. Part of the journey, is the end.
---
I'm a mutated stealth sniper.
---
I aimed for almost exact same build. Early on putting 4 into strength for the carry capacity and moving 3 of that into luck late on.
---
Perks.
---
ammosmith only needed when you craft. Get adrenaline. I have 2 in action boy and swap it out with mr sandman during¬†the day.
---
I dropped escape artist and light footed as they didn't give enough benefits.¬†
---
Endurance is the one I swap out the most. Bought these Lifegiver/ rad resist/ ironclad
---
And let the rng gods roll on level ups to get dromedary good doggy etc¬†
---
Luck
---
Again situational... SBQ get the critical perk cards out... mobs, use grim reaper sprint. If you go mutated then class freak and starched genes are a must... but I don't run starched all the time, just in high rads scenarios.
---
I would aim low in luck... get 1 or 2 star cards and use a good mix... the 1 stars will get you 20% of something... whilst the next star up gets another 10% on top... run 2 one star cards you are getting 40% of whatever rather than 30% of the single card... plus you can get a feel of what you like and max it out later if you really like it. Luck is the fun SPECIAL !!
---
We tested it back in the beta, they used AWS servers. Not all regions, mind you, I got connected to Sydney despite being nowhere near.
---
Do the Mothmen spawn right where Fluffy is or just the general vicinity?  TIA
---
I was thinking along the same line. Now I have a reason to nuke whitesprings again.
---
It's ok little buddy. Show us on the doll where the bad raider touched you.
---
Last 5 ws runs yielded exactly 0 legendaries.  Although the cabins were already cleared 3 of those times.
---
I got the first one months ago and the second a week or two ago. I put it up in my machine for 2k and it flew off the shelf.
---
Pretty balanced atm imo üëç
---
You can't get in through the exit because of the sparking broken switch
---
I was about to post that. I'm greatly hoping for it be true.
---
The exit is the broken lift in the shed next to dropsite v9. It only goes one way.
---
???
---
OP said he's not mad, everyone getting up in arms about a random encounter with a bad ending seems abit ridiculous. It's not griefing, its not persistently ruining someone's experience. If I see someone get dropped by a mutant and snag thier bag I'd be griefing by that logic.
---
I really appreciate it when people are respectful in the same way that I try to be. I wish more players were like this. But it's a good feeling when they actually are.
---
The market was just flooded with stuff from people who don't trade on reddit or anywhere but in game so prices were bound to go down across the board. I know I'm doing great selling stuff cheap that I would have just dropped in train stations if not for the vending machines.
---
I have no idea where it was honestly, probably one of the purveyor posts. Maybe post it on market76 or similar? I can Imagine people interested in oddities lurking there.
---
Yeah, news to me.
---
It is the ultimate stealth blade.
---
So stealthy that it vanished.
---
You added a stealth mod to it ? lol :D
---
I like playing the pvp game and every now and then get messages from opponents congratulating me on a good kill...
---
I am! I‚Äôve only got a humble little hut but the view is nice. Yeah I hear you. Crops are definitely a problem so I just don‚Äôt bother with them, and it‚Äôs hard to find a decent sized spot but the Behemoth definitely put me off so I stuck with it! I‚Äôm probably going to move my CAMP though as I‚Äôve been there for a while now, I‚Äôm just looking for another nice spot to move to.

 Well, the reality is that health care reform is actually going to affect everybody. Starting in 2014, we're going to have a whole new set of health plans, and those plans have very rich benefits with lots of extra features that the existing plans today don't offer. So these new plans are going to be higher cost.

If you remember, you can place them in your stash. I have a stack of each and just grab them for the mission. They are scrap safe once in there
---
Sheepsquatch is definitely one of the most tanks enemies in the game, in sneak I can do 2,500+ damage with some of my rifles and even those take a few shots to take it down. Somewhere on reddit I read that sheepsquatch has the highest HP along with DR and ER
---
Theres a bike mod in new vegas........
---
Random spawn locations are good hunting spots.
---
Westek, Huntersville, Harper's Ferry, General's steakhouse. Pretty much anywhere you can find max level super mutants.
---
Does it have +250 dr while reloading ?
---
While we are at it, protectrons to defend your base and patrol around the CAMP
---
What's the problem exactly?
---
Make it a protectron like from Fo4, where you could choose the profession of the bot, except have a "questline" to get it where someone reprogrammed it to do more "post-war" tasks to make it more useful out in the wasteland.
---
It doesn‚Äôt work well, neither does the car mod
---
On PC, got any photos?
---
I've got the western version of this
---
It's not my favourite weapon lol
---
Seen this on here before now.
---
Rad-X disables Healing Factor, which may be needed if you need that jolt from a stim.
---
I've had so many legendaries that I've had to start another mule on my daughters account.  
---
Even with the excavator double carry bonus glitch and the chems and food perks and perk card juggling I'm still about 100lb over my carry limit.  
---
Ended up ditching the PA to save the cores and running around in my regular armour.
---
Quick, fetch the banhammer!
---
I expect a AAA company to do better than modders. dont say its impossible since people have done it.
---
For the most part I agree, but man no one closes doors. I just moved my camp and set up powered doors with pressure plates. Now they *can‚Äôt* leave them open.
---
My moneys on the big one!

Not pay to win in any way. That's a bunch of of garbage.

At a guess your running a mod and the new texture for the Scout one isn't showing
---
Oh man, sorry I found a bug and posted it with humor
---
I live near Camden Park so I go there everytime I log in to collect scrap and do the dailies and the dross toss stopped giving me Mr fuzzy tokens a long time ago. Just gives experience and that's it.
---
Too true. Golden eye was awesome. Mario kart was awesome. I remember when ocarina of time came out and that was a ground breaking game. Same with the south park game for n64. I would still rock the n64 if I had it. Cant top donkey Kong country on the SNES too. I honestly dont mind cosmetics. I play rocket league and have purchased a little bit of stuff. However that isn't a game from a triple A company that I payed full price for.
---
I have to Tesla rifles a furious in a quad and they both have the same base damage
---
Do you have weight reduction perks on your standard armour such as chems or food weigh 25% less as you'd be surprised how much difference you see if you went naked
---
I've never been able to sell magazines to vendors
---
Where can you find a prototype hazmat suit? If you don't mind me asking
---
I done this too, lured them all into the Tennis court and killed 50 at once
---
I did. For greifing.
---
I just got my password reset link after 3 hours of on and off trying.. This bug seems like it‚Äôs somewhat uncommon but on a rise of occurring. Pretty big issue it seems.
---
HELL YES!
---
God my OCD flares up when I see things that are partially damaged and I can't repair them.
---
if you bought Fallout 76 sometime last year they gave it out. I don't remember if it was just for people who preordered or not
---
900 caps with perks and charisma from the bot. But it can take a long time to get it. In hindsight... I would have paid, lol.
---
I don't think anyone walks in GTA if they actually want to get somewhere.
---
You weigh more when in power armor
---
And who would walk in fallout if you had some sort of vehicle?
---
Mine is a tad odd in that respect. Regardless of mod it shows the same damage, ie regular, barbed or flechette.
---
She flew away with only a few minutes left of the event past the edge of the map so we couldn't shoot her, she came back moments later with full health.
---
That's something I can't explain, sorry.
---
Glad to help. Surprised it worked (with PVP), but pleased.
---
I found the Heavy Robot Arm plan at the NAR Trainyard (I think that's the name) in Cranberry Bog last night
---
Honestly, I believe those are the people who would make it a toxic nightmare anyways.  
---
So for all of those asshats out there:  
---
PLEASE  
---
STAY  
---
AWAY  
---
:)
---
I've randomly found 2 hides, so three more to go - not thought of any good way to farm them, other than maybe gulpers? (My first hide was a gulper, my second was a container, i think a foot locker)
---
I had already found Unstoppables 1,2,3,5 so it appears to have counted those immediately, but despite having the perk card to hear them and picking up every mag i find #4 still alludes me. (also buying it from a player doesn't count ¬¨_¬¨ waste of 50 caps)
---
Do Unstoppables have specific spawn locations, or is it "any mag location can be any mag"
---
Hey dude can you add sodanielso
---
Not all. There's grahm the super mutant who wanders the map.
---
There's a rare responder vendor bit that only spawns at certain random encounter locations.
---
These 2 can NEVER be found inside buildings standing around.
---
Im sure its affected by hunter
---
Yep. Rare and has one of the rarest outfits. Even has a couple camp plans you can only find on it.
---
I'm just commenting to follow your thread, as I would like to know also.
---
Ok, how do you know this? Data mining or testing? Just wanting to make sure before I go blow a bunch of caps on hunter stuff
---
No probs
---
I would love that too
---
Yeah
---
I mean on the roadmap there's a thing under wastelanders labeled new features that's a silhouette of vault boy and a robot
---
This might be easier to follow
---
https://m.ign.com/wikis/fallout-76/How_to_Join_the_Brotherhood_of_Steel
---
I hate when assholes ruin my daughter and mines fun.
---
I agree. Give the random spawns some sort of damage immunity or a large pool of health before they just get downed.
---
Like Grahm!
---
Your perk cards and armor legendary effects can reduce item weight and cause your weight to be better outside of power armor.
---
I'll see your thousand, and raise you ONE MILLION
---
They made sure you can't by making the exit... Exit only.
---
Gotta run the whole area.
---
Yea they weigh a lot less if younmsx that perk out.
---
I've read a lot of thing's saying it's Zealots, I think the only question is if Hunter does or not.
---
If I could upvote twice, I would do so.  
---
If other players decide to ignore obvious personal space, they pay the price.  
---
(And forfeit their paper bag.)
---
Its a known glitch. Either crouch or stand when reloading ,.should be ok
---
Yeah I don't know if we need full on assaultrons, but a quest to get an eyebot with a utility slot for cargo or recon or something would be awesome.
---
Thanks for the input
---
Ok
---
There was a glitch that duplicated certain things when the server crashed... PA included.
---
I gave away my duped excavator and ultracite armors. Didn't want to trash them.
---
I want a Gandalf beard, please and thank you.
---
I will fianlly move my base (same spot since beta) into the mountains and live like a hermit.
---
The Nuclear Disposal site near the Whitesprings, first room inside, turn right, get past the security door, turn left and is inside a little room. On a counter, near fusion cells and a laser rifle.
---
That's been my experience the week leading up to the debut of the Purveyor. I had no problem reaching the 1000 scrip max playing a couple hrs per day.
---
Well done my boy *fatherly back pat*
---
general vicinity. i‚Äôve noticed they like to creep on a cliff to the northeast of fluffy
---
Awesome, thanks for the info!
---
Charleston. There a bridge above water. Jump off without armor on.
---
I thought so :) I was like 99.9% sure the perk effected Fusion Cores but I had a brain fart and doubted my own sanity. I'm trying to do a P.A build at the moment. Cheers :)
---
I think every fallout has a Star Trek reference
---
How are you making 1400 caps off vendors at a time at level 10? I'm level 83 and struggle to get my caps over 3k, usually hover right at 3k.
---
I think they call that a Biden-bot
---
Just luck. I found 20ish legendaries between two runs around Whitesprings and one run through the Burrows the day before the Scrip machines came out. Then not much for the rest of the week. And then I found 13 legendaries in one run around Whitesprings the night that the Purveyor came out. And last night, I didn't get a single one.
---
Did you get a email straight after you submitted your ticket? I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôve done it right as wouldn‚Äôt let me do it on my phone.
---
What story?
---
toxic larry's
---
Equip Shotgun, blow its legs off, tie a rope around the neck, drag it back to your CAMP.
---
Patch notes. Shotguns were bug fixed.
---
Simple, my friend. All vendors share a total of 1,400 caps now. Just go into to Whitesprings and ignore the robots rambling of ‚Äúno looting‚Äù and take EVERYTHING. Loot every trash can, every case, every telephone. Then sell them and switch servers until they don‚Äôt have any caps left. They‚Äôll have more roughly 15 or so hours later.
---
Nuking someone and/or their CAMP is about as personal as it gets.
---
AFAIK 'any location any mag'.
---
In my case I had already found #3-#5 but it did not count towards the challenge, for this I have to find them again.
---
But It was a level 25. 
---
Mine is 45. 
---
It's not really a  duplicate .
---
Grafton dam has some good spots to do it.
---
And knock the effect volume down while they're at it.
---
Yep.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfsfnf/psa\_which\_enemies\_are\_affected\_by\_versus/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bfsfnf/psa_which_enemies_are_affected_by_versus/)
---
one spawns just south of crevasse dam too
---
So both effect it? That is interesting
---
Yea, but not sure why I got down voted for sharing my experience. I was only stating tses did not get a second nerf.
---
Cap stash runs. I routinely get 500 caps from a trip across the map hitting the right places. You need Cap Collector and Fortune Finder PERK cards.
---
if u think about it, in morgantown airport there is a robot ready to be sold
---
I was looking it up a lot cause i wanted to know too, basically every answer ive found says hunter. And still benefits from scorch killer receiver but apparently the Zealots guns are just for Scorched and Scorched creatures. Would be good if someone could verify what ive just said though üòÇ
---
Okay cool. Any places in particular?
---
Built mine when severely intoxicated, it shows.
---
This is a very good idea
---
Of course they're independent. The point is that it's better to have 1000 chances if you only need to hit it right one time.
---
There's a 50% chance that one flip produces one heads result. There's a 75% chance that two flips will return at least one heads result.
---
Gambler's fallacy only applies AFTER you've already failed every other attempt.
---
If I say to you "I will give you $100 if you flip the coin and it lands on heads. You can either flip it once, or try 10 times", would you honestly think the extra 9 attempts don't help your chances? How about 100 chances? It's a 50% chance on the 10th attempt alone, but there's only a 0.097% chance of failure if you have 10 tries and only need to hit it right once.
---
This is called the Bernoulli process
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_process
---
Essentially, you multiply the odds of failure (on a scale of 0 to 1) by itself for each attempt.
---
One coin flip is 0.5, or 50%. Two coin flips is 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.25. 25% chance of failure, therefore 75% chance of success. Each individual attempt is 50%, and collectively it's a 25% chance to fail both times, 25% chance to succeed both times, or a 50% chance to succeed once, and fail once. Since you only need to succeed once, both of the latter 2 outcomes are considered an overall success.
---
In this case, say there's even only a 1% chance of success (getting a useful weapon). You'll multiply the chance of failure (0.99) by itself for as many attempts as you make.
---
For 5 attempts, you'll get (0.99 ^5=0.951). 95.1% chance of failing every time, but a 4.9% chance of hitting it at least one time.
---
For 50 attempts you get (0.99^50=0.605). 60.5% chance of failure, and a 39.5% chance of hitting your 1% chance at least one time in those 50%.
---
At 100 attempts it looks much better. 0.99^100 means a 36.6% chance of failure, and a 63.4% chance of at least one success out of the 100 tries. The 100th try is still 1%, but the extra chance represents the fact that you may have already succeeded once (or more) in the previous 99 attempts.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter anyway. I got scammed out of the plan. Theres no way to trade it securely. The only way to give it to other players is to drop it. The guy I was tryna help scammed me instead and logged so yeah.
---
The savage divide region seems to be more consistent
---
A lot less I'm carrying 43 of them around think each one weighs .3 I think
---
I actually have a circuit board, so I'm down. 
---
But I also want to complete the possum challenge for being a conduit while doing this run.
---
How much u want and what ur platform
---
Wait. By yourself?
---
I just want it to tell me how much the item weighs in my inventory and how much it weighs in my stash separately, since I have been lead to believe the weight reducing perks dont count in the stash, but the items only show the reduced weight when looking through your stash.
---
I am constantly at 800 pounds and I hate it.
---
I'm guessing and hoping the 4+5*'s will be dungeon boss rewards.
---
It would be a terrible move on bgs to lock it to pvp.
---
I will never touch the current survival mode. It is too arcade like and gimmicky for me with leaderboards and such.
---
If they were smart atom store purchases wouldn't count to budget.  But I guess it's all about server stability
---
Thank you!
---
Add Avengel-- :)
---
Are fusion cores energy weapon ammunition?
---
In other words: is the pope Catholic?
---
Okay I'll add you now, give me like 5-10 mins
---
It's says right there bottom left 355
---
I'd like to see an eyebot that would slowly repair you base or harvest your crops/water.
---
That'd be amazing.
---
My friend is the conduit, but yes I deal enough damage that my last run was done with 8:40 on the clock
---
Do like Skyrim did in dawnguard fire/ice/electricity
---
Too many to detail here, I'd be typing War and Peace. Go to YouTube and search for "Cap Stash" or some such.   
---
Good thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b4so1m/cap\_stash\_runs\_where\_is\_your\_farming\_spot/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/b4so1m/cap_stash_runs_where_is_your_farming_spot/)
---
Have you seen the stealthy sledgehammer too? She's a beaut.
---
Excellent
---
That‚Äôs impressive. Hard to wrap my head around, but impressive.
---
I think combat is better because you deal more damage In a short amount of time unlike the DB which it takes a few seconds
---
It's a long standing bug annoying and random and sucks with high capacity mags like the round Gatling gun one that holds 500 bullets
---
There is  workshop at the bottom the map around the area where silo charlie is. Sorry not on atm. It has several resources nodes you can use to smelt down. Use perk super duper and it wont take that long to have a high amount.
---
It doesnt work right for this engine
---
The ultimate mutation!
---
Thanks, I'll check that out.
---
Lol
---
WHO has it?
---
Imposters the same weeks ago, and the community dude acknowledged it... sadly nothing yet. Would fit so well with the region.
---
Later snowflake!
---
You're welcome
---
Where do you find the jars?
---
Rifles get tons of mods but everything else gets no mods or just a few. Always was strange to me.
---
Go from camp to camp, and flip rare items/weapons
---
Three fiddy?
---
Flip?
---
His information is not correct. Explosive legacy weapons are incredibly OP in the PVP meta. They make skill less player into monsters when outfitted with beam weapons.  Its a weapon for scrubs that aren't interested in even competition. Its no coincidence that so may players that have them are bunny hopping ass/sent wearing embarassments.
---
Its likely the beam splitter mod &amp; explosive effect trigger the same bug that shotguns had until recently.  They just melt ya even if its just a graze.
---
Yeah, my build is very intensive. 100 percent crit build
---
Lore wise everyone being nice to each other makes perfect sense, we all just spent the last 25 years in a vault together. Being rude and finally getting back at that prick who pissed you off for the last 25 years also makes sense, but primarily I expect the vault dwellers to be cordial toward each other at the very least.
---
Why a down vote? I've searched like crazy for this, nit seen much definitive other thsn the Nuka-Cola plant.
---
Exploding, Bleeding, Poison, Flaming, Shocking, and Homing are just a few mods that could be used that come to mind.  SO many possibilities.
---
Ah, my bad, didn't even consider that for magazines. What about moth man wings which were mentioned earlier too?
---
I ain't giving you no tree fiddy
---
A better sight is needed and arrow types yes please and a frame mod would be nice in aluminium.
---
Go through blackwater mine. There's uranium ore veins.
---
I never tried Stalkers. I wonder how it works with the VATS bug?.......I constantly miss my first shot in VATS and then you miss every shot after that until you exit VATS and re-enter VATS. Usually by the time you realize that you are a victim of the VATS bug you have 6 ghouls beating the crap out of you.
---
I would just like to find a crossbow that reduces in durability so I can repair it and get my tadpole badge.
---
I still have my assaultron recall keycard... Same thing?
---
Add different arrows, sights and maybe textures like have tape on the stock, damage and clean versions,metal and wood version??
---
Yep, same thing
---
Like buy them and sell them back for a higher price and get profit from it. ‚ÄúFlip it‚Äù
---
Let me know if you want to do it... Psn is ascarin1988
---
Sorry to hear that man.
---
Ah. Sorry just never heard the term. I can‚Äôt believe I never thought of that
---
Actually if You read the OP no it wasn't people fast traveling to it. It was set up by another person who had vending set up. People were curious and chose to enter it.
---
Hell, do you forget the first time someone made a suicide booth in this game and posted it in this subreddit? The community managers here commented on how innovative it was? If it was griefing that wasn't supposed to be In the game they wouldn't have been complimenting them.
---
What I did was find some players in a dangerous situation (low level in the mire, attempting Encryptid, SBQ ect) and essentially stalk them until one goes down.
---
[](/cehail)I looked at [all the plans for the Excavator](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/249279013510578186/579286161034313729/Excavator.png), checked [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/b4pg9i/discussion_excavator_power_armor_tactical_red/) [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/aj2i1m/ps4_h_caps_w_bright_or_tactical_red_excavator/) [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar/comments/blz7to/wtb_excavator_headlamp_red_tactical/) market threads looking for one, and even checked to see if any sketchy sellers on Ebay had one, unless alternate headlamps only exist as an extremely rare loose mod then I don't think it exists.
---
It‚Äôs giving a roll from every possible legendary, can‚Äôt expect every roll you‚Äôre getting a god tier weapon in the current meta
---
Read the ok closely, the death room didn't, it was just built near another camp thst did have vending set up.
---
I price to sell.  Generally half to a quarter of what the default list price is. Depending on how valuable I think it it.  Then if it doesn't sell I gather it up, find a locked base and find a way inside and leave a baggy on their beds.
---
I found 7 at the Nuka-cola plant, maybe try jumping server. There was 2 in the room on first floor to the right and 1 in the room on the left. Then go to the end of the top floor and fall down the hole and 2 more in there. Then there‚Äôs a few more on the bottom. That‚Äôs going in the main entrance with the reception.
---
When you grow up beathesda will give you the bladed part.
---
I shoulda returned it to the Watoga super duper market  ..
---
They fixed that in patch 9.5
---
Yea, perhaps, cuz if stalkers works as described, it should always be 100% hitchance when you are not in combat ,hope they fix that
---
That‚Äôs very specialized. I could take a lesson, friend. :)
---
The holotape games spawned at the same places as magazines.
---
I shot a glowing mole and it had a legendary goulash explosive gatling gun on it don't remember it being a legendary in the first place.
---
I'd do electric for a stun effect.
---
I strongly don't want these kind of in game items in the item shop. Part of my problem with the game at the moment is there is not enough stuff everyone can earn and too much everyone can only buy.
---
You'll notice there's an empty nukashine bottle in the back referencing that video someone made üòÇ
---
Imposters?
---
every little bit helps
---
it's actually 90 btw
---
Tldr: read a terminal in Abbie's bunker to trigger "Defiance has fallen".
---
Yes, but where? At least two of the games I‚Äôve mentioned are static spawns. Magazines, as far a I know, are not.
---
One spawns at the range where you can get the plan Repari it, go out and melee things to drop durability, repeat.
---
Unless you repair for +durability naturally.
---
If you're on xbox I can make some for you, wear them down and then give them to you to repair.
---
The point being is the main story puts you where you should be questing. At level 15 you should be in the ash heap or toxic valley, not the West side lf the map such as the bog and mire. Those are the end game areas. You need to do more quests in the areas you are the level for. It is just like Wow you have to do side quests or grind levels before you can handle the other areas.
---
A Derl Edition skin would be nice lol
---
Get it? It's Daryl without the copyright infringement!
---
Craft one without having the weapons artisan perk, take a shot, repair, take another shot, repair, take one more shot, repair. That's how I did it
---
Out of 20 different 3*s, 2 of them are decent. I have no complaints at all about what I‚Äôve gotten. Man I go the casino and play with worse odds than this üòÇ 
---
I have no idea why people are expecting a god roll when they try their luck with her.
---
The point is that a vehicle wouldn't do you any good in Fallout. Where would you drive it? A location like river gorge bridge or big bend tunnel would have to be designed completely differently to let a vehicle through. Any open areas that do exist in fallout are a flaw in the map that should be more densely filled with content, not a place to drive around in.
---
Yeah I made a crossbow and smashed a few people in the face but not it‚Äôs still maxed on durability. Thought it was bugged. Might need to do more face smashing. 
---
As providence has it I‚Äôm on Xbox. Can you DM me your gamer tag and I‚Äôll send you a message? I also need a friend to complete the ‚Äúrevive an ally‚Äù if you‚Äôd be interested in helping me get that too?
---
It‚Äôs worth noting that you can pass out and wake up inside the cart after drinking Nukashine
---
I guess the one benefit of 100% vs. 95% is that you will know for sure that you are a victim of the VATS bug after the first shot. At 95% I'm usually not certain until I've missed 3 shots.
---
Some people like games where your armies fight for you. Don't pretend everyone thinks that's a bad thing. Have you ever played desert strike?
---
Indeed
---
Also make the event fast travel free if a flare goes up. Would encourage players to jump across the map.
---
I sell my hats everyday for 1400 caps easy to make takes me about 30 mins each day and yes I do have a plan for the hats if anyone wants to buy it
---
Thanks!
---
Those are probably the only static spawns. Mini-games are rewarded when you pick up "RobCo Fun" magazines, in random magazine spawns.
---
What kind if hats?
---
It will be an atom shop skin
---
I have never been able to hear voice chat..
---
It's been recently changed, double check.
---
Is this on PC too?
---
I won't buy it if its an atom item...
---
It can have cool skins though in the store.
---
Oh. Ok. And those are probably random. Crap. It would be nice to know what games everybody has found with the mags. I‚Äôve only found atomic command.
---
Still capped and I think there are still dupers
---
I got pipfall at camp venture in the caged room. It was under the shelves on the floor in the back of the room.
---
Quad db is awesome
---
Put a " . " before your armor names, they will come out on top and will be easier to equip.
---
Thanks now I know I need to save up some atoms
---
Hazmat suit, you mean the suicide suit right?
---
Anywhere you frequently find a magazine...the rest I in the hands of RNGesus. I got pipfall again thursday at whitesprings clubhouse.
---
Homing?
---
How much you want to bet they offer a camp limit increase in the atom shop in the future?
---
The unfortunate part is I already did that quest too.  :/
---
Its doing better than ever.
---
As I said before, some places could just be flagged as non rideable. Sure, so why not instead of having to walk for 5-10 min on foot without nothing to do or see, why not just give me a bike where I can go faster and jump around. Makes no sense to why people are against this. It would make the journey more fun and save you some caps.
---
Yea feel slow and bulky
---
Caged room? Cool. Thanks.
---
I get this from time to time. The only thing that helps me is going to a new server.
---
There are other forms of currency, namely Scrip. There are plenty of people well under the 25k mark. If you go buy some of the more expensive Legendary pieces people sell, you can break them down for Scrip and make someone happy their TS Tesla gun sold for 4k caps. 
---
My theory:
---
This game suffers from server strain, the same strain that keeps our stash currently at 800. Adding more numbers/larger numbers for the server to track would probably over-strain their servers and start causing major crashes (which would piss off all the people like you coming back because you‚Äôd feel the game is still fundamentally broken).
---
Was that in lower level near the locker room?
---
You can put the shielded backpack with the hazmat
---
A "stop sucking" mod would be divine. I think it's fun to use, but it's underpowered as heck.
---
Yessir!
---
Stupid
---
Wavy Willard‚Äôs water park, get on the rails and as you go round there‚Äôs a small pool below you, Jump from the rails into the water.
---
Cool
---
If there are any places in the map where you travel for 10 minutes without encountering anything interesting the map needs to be fixed. It doesn't need to have systems added that exist specifically to deal with parts of the map like that, because that introduces an actual need to have parts of the map like that.
---
yes on PC..
---
threads like this pop up every so often.. usually with lots of suggestions how to fix it..
---
Ive tried all the things Ive seen mentioned to fix it with no positive result..
---
My scorched beast queen dropped me nothing.... literally nothing, was completely empty... was not happy at all.
---
Nuking Watoga should yield a bunch of messed up robots that attack you and can be legendary
---
I'm not sure but i think they changed it with latest patch
---
So rather than use the mode specifically made for things like that, you intend to just fuck over the players who‚Äôve no interest in that. Yay, another moron out to spoil other people‚Äôs enjoyment
---
Yes I obviously overlooked them as it's only affected me recently oddly enough.
---
Always some in the room next to biv and you can't gather it with a machine at the powerplant workshop.
---
Tell me more about this 250 DR bug.
---
Im endgame but havent been running it when I see it - maybe this post will get me off my ass and make it an A-list must-fastTravel event
---
Appreciate the good work the community does, making us casuals better players :)
---
I dont agree, I don't see a single problem to add a bike to the map as it is.
---
Even if they filled those spaces with some content, it doesn't mean you'd be stopping to interact with every single thing. I dont get why the only options for getting to point A to B are walk or fast travel. 10 years ago I could understand it, especially since the game was rushed. But nowadays not so much.
---
Honestly that my main reason for suggesting this I have one wall that has like 2% health left. Just destroy it already so I can fix it.
---
Mods, my dude. I don't know of anything to allow searching but Save Everything and Old Style Workbench Repair will fix most of your complaints. I'd also strongly recommend the Perk Loadout Manager and Better Inventory while you're at it. They completely change the way the game plays.
---
Did you try to register as new personnel as part of recruitment blues in fort defience? You should also have found Squire Evens journal pg16 sending you to the DMV...
---
I am surprised because the remnants of Appalachia would definitely have an abundance of bows and compound bows left about.
---
thats something ive seen a lot on ghouls
---
well.. they arent as frequent as the UnF uNF mah game iS gLitChed bethesda FiX iT threads.. lol
---
Bring back the Minutemen flares! Haha
---
I responded to a flare once, this level 20 was trying to tackle a level 50 Deathclaw - so I helped him out! That's the kinda content I enjoy seeing - strangers coming together to make a story.
---
If we can push people to send up flares for tough fights, or even before entering the nuke launches, or the Barrows, or before events get hectic, we could start this!
---
It's mainly the new weapons they added  which have little or no mods, the stuff ported from 4 have mods. Noticed how Riflemen are limited to the same guns we been using since 2015/16?
---
I want explosive bolts :)
---
well if its a permanent disconnect I guess you wont be seeing him again :P 
---
jk thats only the initial response from reading the subject :) would like to offer something heklp ful i got nothing right now.
---
Cap limit also limits inflation
---
Even my TS one is useless in the SD, Mire and CB.
---
Lol sheesh it‚Äôs part of the lore stop whining yay look another cry baby who wants to play fallout 76 lite...it‚Äôs fine feel free to move on kid I‚Äôm not looking to grief I‚Äôm looking to profit
---
Good mix of Bolstering/Unyielding. I personally go 3 unyielding 2 bolstering, but probably most people benefit from switching that around 3/2.
---
You should get stoned
---
He joins server, gets booted, join server, gets booted. Nonstop
---
Bethesda said in the patch notes that stat Increases due to over repair were a bug and never meant to happen in the first place. They fixed it so now you just get extra durability.
---
whats you ign i would love to come see i am off work now . also i am pc.
---
I sell cival war hats and everyone is like they are nerfed lol yes they were but it‚Äôs still easily doable and I do it everyday
---
Thanks for the input.
---
Nah. You‚Äôd just rather slap-damage low levels to death rather than play a game-mode where you might actually get killed instead.
---
Man I HATE being too young for knives :(
---
I get a lot of people won't like this idea, especially on Adventure Mode, but if you're serious about the RP and putting on a show, I say Good Luck to you.
---
Especially, since on Survival, you'd be dead before you could say, "Stick 'em up!"
---
This is a game balance feature, meant to make being invisible less O.P.
---
Nerfed? Did they actually have an effect to start with?
---
There customer service is shit too
---
I gave up on Swarm as well because it was so bugged back in beta, but due to the Pioneer Scouts starting in the immediate vicinity, Ive ended up doing it twice this week, both times it was quick and easy and flowed as one hoped it would. Give it a go in your SCIENCE and Im sure it will go up a notch in your tier ranking :)
---
For bloodied it comes down to unyielding or bolstering. Melee really benefit more from the unyielding but if you use VATS crit perks the luck boost unyielding provides is really nice also.
---
I‚Äôve gotten unyielding but it was wooden. RNGesus, man.
---
I ‚Ä¢posted‚Ä¢ :)
---
Combat armor or marine?
---
Is there anything really worth 25k. I tried selling a 3 star explosive shotgun for that price and the offers ranged from 7250 to 10k. I think the issue is that not many just walk around with that kinda caps. I myself at most have had just under 9k on hand.
---
Oh wow ok thank u so like it‚Äôs harder to break down.
---
Poison bolts would be sick as fuck
---
Would definitely allow for more doctor rp on here I can agree with this
---
No fuckin way, LOL
---
Haha this is great.
---
Nerfed the amount of materials it takes to craft them
---
In my case, I just don't have a lot of nice stuff unlocked yet as a new player. Once I do, I'll move yet again to properly set up a totally legit medical practice.
---
The hemet is from the Dev room with cheat software the players got there and when you scrap it you will automaticaly the plan thats the reason why you see it so often on Pc and not on consoles!
---
As far as I know, they don't show up in your inventory when you're transferring things to the Stash.
---
Being something like Stimpacks for gear, I can understand why they have weight, but it's incompatible with the inability to drop or offload them.  Even normal Atomic Shop outfits let you do that.
---
Yes like that and also using trap bases and well they kind screwed their own pooch on this one..Survival is pointless for high lvl players no incentive
---
Cool, thx man. 
---
I just spend 2,000 scrip the other day on armor and did'nt see one of the above mentioned effects so was worrying about them being on the "loot table" at all ... Fair enough if they are a little harder to get than the others, just dont wanna be chasing something that isnt there :D
---
I‚Äôve seen it glitch were she is stuck on the ground not moving ...  and we just brutalized her..   I‚Äôve also seen her fly off with little hp left and we lose the event.
---
Personally? I like bos combat armor.
---
Haven't found a single one, and no clue where to look either.
---
This place: [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Federal\_disposal\_field\_HZ-21](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Federal_disposal_field_HZ-21)
---
I have this minigun, and my damage didn't change when I got an alcohol addiction. I'm going to relog and see if the damage changes, but it may be bugged.
---
Its people like you that make the Fallout 76 community so fantastic.
---
Thank you
---
Damn
---
Dude... are you Obama??!!
---
As a nightly Pickaxe Pilsner drinker, I can assure you it's Glowing Fungus, not Blight..
---
Because you claimed the OP was doing something wrong without any explanation... And that was wrong. They are not.
---
Also, TSE did get a Nerf in a previous patch. So that was also wrong.
---
Then TSE shotguns had an additional bug fix done to them more recently.
---
Errr....sure?
---
yes.
---
My own experience was:
---
level +50 characters: 3 max level √≠tems
---
another +50 level character: 3 max level items 
---
level 15 character: two level 10 weapons (two 3* bad pipes, grrr...)
---
Ah. Good to know
---
PS4: Chobowan
---
HELLO. MEMBERS. WE HAVE. ANOTHER LOCATION. THAT WE ARE. INTERESTED IN.
---
(might be slightly wrong but it is something like this)
---
@ someones vendor,never seen them before tho,i bought 2 of them
---
This is right up there with the 3* bloodied rolling pin I got yesterday. Useless POS.
---
I'd be happy with a sight that makes sense, but other stuff would be cool too.
---
I meant top floor not first.
---
I was in someone's shop yesterday flipping through the menus when they logged off. When everything disappeared, I happened to fire a bullet into a car that exploded and killed my friend who was near by..
---
Patch 9 changed it so Deathclaws, Mirelurks, and Radscorpions are no longer considered animals.  Mirelurks and Radscorpions are considered "insects" (Exterminators).  I have no idea what affects the "reptile" aspect of a Deathclaw.
---
I'm using it and i think in PvP it should just deflect bullets percentage isn't high anyway
---
Lol. Does this mean it's one of the new spawn points post black out?
---
Honestly, I'd just delete the character and start it over if need be.
---
Can you "Telescope' the bolts to make bridges?
---
I got a anti armor shot gun with 15 after reload and +33 vats chance to hit
---
And a sentinel and a cavalier piece
---
Yup. I managed to fire about 5 arrows "Robin Hood" style where they are perfect dead centre and you can walk right over them.
---
I've definitely noticed since Patch 9 more Super Mutants screaming "RETREAT!" when their numbers have dwindled to a certain point.  They seem to run away and try to find a friend.  It's a minor thing, but it makes them seem a bit more intelligent.
---
Ive gotten majority good stuff
---
Yup. Unyielding, bolstering, cav, and sent.
---
Normal Combat Helmet and Gasmask is the closest we can get. 
---
It's not the same, but it grows on you.
---
I have a floating camp, no ragrets. I put mine over a vista and I think staring at wood textures is an eyesore compared to the natural view
---
Stick ‚Äòem with the point‚Äî oh. Never mind.
---
Yeah just wood and the scout armor.
---
Let me know how the build goes. I'm always interested in seeing other players builds.
---
Some people have suggested that legendary prefixes seem to be somehow tied to the server you are in. So if you get crap on your first roll, jump servers and maybe (if these guys are right) you'll get something better.
---
PC?
---
The amount of time and effort put into this is insane... You may want to visit your doctor for a diagnosis but until then upvoted to infinity
---
.45 or 10mm?
---
If .45, you can farm them in the train car near Watoga with the Marine Wetsuit plans, and scrap them for the suprressor.
---
If you're on PS4 come check out Flooptown! If you're tired of getting random junk from some mute mole mama, talk to a reaaaaaal legendary trader. All three stars, all the time... Alllllright
---

---
I think I saw some at grafton
---
So one thing about Dross Toss is that you have to throw them from outside the the area with the tires. I would do it from inside and it failed all the time for like 6 months until I figured this out.
---
The references are what makes me want to play again. Is my favorite part of the fallout series
---
There is a good opportunity somewhere here, with both bows and crossbows, to incorporate suction cups.    
---
An arrow or bolt which has a suction cup would stick to an enemy - causing little to no damage but providing some sort of 'nerf'.  For example if it were glow in the dark or colored some bright neon color it would make the enemy easier to strike.  A group of players could barrage an enemy with these 'marker arrows' and then could chase it down and attack it via other means.    
---
Understandable decent 'stuck to enemy' arrow/bolt graphics would be hard - but this is the idealist of ideals and I would be happy to see that it is marked some other way.
---
I was playing with him for the last few hours prior, we were farming ammo. I server hopped and he tried to follow, game wouldn't let him.
---
I just wanna be Hawkeye...or at least Legalos, all through the wasteland
---
If you bash enemies with it, the durability goes down very quickly. That's how I did it after reading that tip in another thread.
---
I believe it'd be flaming/cryo/shock for th FO universe
---
I want Bowie knife mods!!
---
How much you charge?
---
Yeah, Appalachia Antiques and the exterior of RobCo Research Center are two locations that I feel would really benefit from having a workbench *somewhere*.  I run into issues with the latter frequently after AWOL Armaments.
---
Is this near Helvetia by any chance?
---
I know Helvetia/Helgen aren't that similar in name, but both are populated by Germanic/Swiss people in both games...
---
It's at Grafton Station now as a static spawn
---
I mean from a lore perspective we all grew up together and haven't been out of the vault long enough to have really drifted that  much apart so it makes sense that we are all really polite and friendly. Plus it is West Virginia and I have never met a blatantly rude person there.
---
When they get like that, my OCD kicks in and if they‚Äôre not wired up with a bunch of other crap, I scrap and rebuild. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
What server ?
---
ok now that is epic
---
That's awesome. Got something new to try tonight, lol.
---
He needs to be able to also tell me bad jokes ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Amazing idea, but they will again turn it into atom economy to suck our money
---
That is a good point.  On a low-health build, Purified Water can get the job done almost as well as a Stimpack in some cases.
---
Well I found it by fluke. Having to do the stupid archer challenge for the new backpack and when I get bored I just do stupid things, turns out it sometimes bears fruit haha.
---
No it isnt
---
It is fun.
---
Man if I had the Reddit points, I‚Äôd gold this comment üåü
---
Slap Damage was removed a few patches ago...
---
Really dig your idea for a Raider gang but I gotta ask...... Why Adventure mode? You're going to go up against people with no interest in PvP and you can't damage player C.A.M.P.S  or even kill players unless contesting a Workshop (even then it has to  be within the bounds of the Workshop). So what would be the point?
---
I personally go into Survival mode and try to kick ass but get spanked 99% of the time (that's me being generous on myself tbh). So why not try this idea within the confines of the Survival mode unless you are CHICKEN ;)
---
NB: I am going off 'memory' in regards to player C.A.M.P damage and the ability to kill players unless contesting a Workshop. If someone can confirm I'd be grateful  :)
---
Cheers
---
Marine! As a bloodied build, you don't want more rads! So marine and lead mods
---
I was specifically referring to fast traveling in but putting up vending as false advert is still false advertising. and being clever doesn't mean you aren't griefing...
---
And of course unyielding/bolstering mix set
---
Oh... you could find voice mods, too maybe? The French maid, the grouchy drill sarge? Humor mods for bad jokes? Stylist mods to change your hair???
---
There‚Äôs such an insane discrepancy between what I‚Äôve encountered in FO76 as a woman and what my sister hears whenever she plays games like Rainbow 6. Nobody‚Äôs ever even acknowledged that I‚Äôm female, meanwhile she hears [shit like this](https://youtu.be/jL0aVqVslSE) CONSTANTLY. I‚Äôm really glad I can enjoy this game in peace.
---
Gameplay wise, sure that makes sense.
---
Realistically, you couldn‚Äôt see a flare from the other side of West Virginia. So maybe there should be a range for it to work.
---
Yeah sure no worries at all. Will take a day or two as real life stuff etc and need to get more info regards perks etc :)
---
I want to change how it looks too. I want a big heavy badass crossbow. Not a piece of wood.
---
Thanks a lot Jim! You are doing a great service for Appalachia! 
---
I may have some more business for you. Are you on Discord?
---
Houses are invincible in pvp as well
---
If you run into build capacity issues a lot, your CAMP might simply be too big from a floorplan standpoint.  People who build the giant 2-story 5x5 CAMPs will struggle to fill them with things.  But if you keep things rather compact, you can get pretty dense with detail and not wreck your budget.
---
Agreed, but you can probably blame the WS campers for that one.
---
No problem, stop by any time. I‚Äôm not on discord too much. It‚Äôs easiest to let me know what you need here or via voice chat in game.
---
I believe so
---
I like getting close to the bridge near the overseer‚Äôs camp. I get nekkid, take off Fireproof if I have it, and toss a few frags at the bridge. They‚Äôll bounce back.
---
I do that so people can check the 3 star items I am selling.
---
On the other hand,  it‚Äôs thoughtful of them to travel back to base so you can look at the effects on any 3* legendaries.
---
He‚Äôd have to remove the paint first
---
[](/ce08)I'll keep my eye out for that, thanks for letting me know.  
---
Also nice minigun, color me jealous. The only junkies explosives I've found are a lv40 gatling, and a pump action(which is terrible).
---
Yes it is!! If you wanna send me a message I will be on soon!
---
do fast travel to your base if you have multi star legendaries* and you are not in the middle of something
---
otherwise customers view the other stars
---
That‚Äôs remarkably simple and I‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt think of that. 
---
Thank you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It makes me question whether the harpoon gun can do the same
---
Yes plz. A scope would be rad.
---
üòÆ TO THE LABORATORY!
---
I‚Äôm referring to the hovering with your gun out. I usually go back and jump on my banjo or something
---
Yes, anything with atom shop paint cannot be dropped.  It will auto destroyed. Just remove the paint before doing so. Or use game paint that is not from atom shop.
---
I do too but I don‚Äôt hover with my gun out. I play the banjo, craft or something
---
I mean is that such a terrible thing?  Base model can be in game quest, but skins / voices etc could be ATOM shop.  I'd spring for that.
---
Is he wearing power armor?
---
Look up "duplex ammunition".  This is essentially what the TS effect emulates.  In such a cartridge, the 2nd bullet is sat deep into the casing (beneath the first).  This means less space for gunpowder.  Duplex rounds will also sometimes use lighter/shorter bullets compared to a conventional cartridge.  So, while (as many point out) there are many problems with gun damage/functionality in 76, the TS not doing +100% damage really isn't one of them.
---
AP refresh
---
Check the fusion core if it's zero drop it, fixed this for me.
---
What are the mats? Is it cheaper than marine tactical helmet to produce and sell?
---
If you have a 3\* weapon with the 250 DR while reloading legendary effect, it can bug out the damage.
---
So, you have been raped multiple times in survival, were real pvp players fight, and now want to kill low lvl players? And cant do it solo? Loool
---
Build a bar! *As long ^as ^it‚Äôs ^^small!*
---
OP clearly said this was looted from a mob, not bought from the purveyor. The glitch of legendary effects disappearing is exclusive to the purveyor
---
Lol actually I did quiet well in survival just not worth it as a raider I go where the profit is and hopefully I‚Äôll see your base
---
Is your gun fully automatic works for me
---
https://youtu.be/NWt6NTinCaQ
---
Heres me doing it
---
I'm pretty sure that in the datamined game files a lot of unimplemented weapons were found, like the chinese assault rifle and a compound bow.
---
I figured it out, you craft them at the chemistry station.
---
It‚Äôs easy to work around that
---
I‚Äôm sure you apologize after blowing some random‚Äôs face off.  Pffft...Canadians.  ;)
---
Not the only skyrim reference.
---
When I was starting off in vault 76 one of the Mr handys said
---
"I used to be a vault dweller/adventurer like you but I took an arrow to the knee"
---
Can't remember off hand exactly what he said it was a very long time ago 
---
Tried to replicate it with an alt but none of the robots said it again ( I wanted to video it lol)
---
I jump on the piano/banjo  and hope I get a tip for playing while they shop!!
---
I was thinking something very similar recently. Although I was thinking how nice it'd b to have a personal robot at camp. Basically implement features from Automatron (Robot workbench, build a bot system, etc. ) but limit it to 1 bot per player. Then possibly have it so while at the workbench you can set it's programming between scavenging, defense and maybe even maitenence (slowly repair damaged camp objects) for example.
---
Because there is no profit in Survival and we all don‚Äôt want to have bad encounters but this is the wastes and want it or not it happens
---
Lol i just see it a minute ago,was gonna reply,where to find bloodleaf?
---
Explosive tips would be swell.
---
Um any server?
---
Except for Bob.  He always peed on the toilet seats.  And in a confined space where cleaning supplies consist of 25 year old rags and little in the way chemical sanitation.  Yeah...Bob must die.
---
Think leather and cloth all you need 3 cloth 1 leather all super easy to get and make
---
I see your point but what about the most recent dupe where all you did was sell your items to the waiter at white spring and then everyone bought those items? It didnt crash the servers at all.
---
Just got Vanguard AP refresh Scout arm first roll with the the new vendor
---
Can you tell me where to find the plan? I gonna farm it
---
One bit of advice on plans. If you don't know a plan learn it even if it seems useless. In many cases it opens up the next lvl of plans. You have to take the bad with the good in this game to progress.
---
It grow on top of water near river banks or in ponds.
---
Thanks man, I'll let you know how I make out!
---
Ty
---
Come to 3650 we got 10 there we are just trying to mount our first attack
---
Ny psn is gofukyurslf326 and yes it's my name
---
It'll be a couple hours before I can get on but if no one else comes along to help I can. Probably about 2.5 hours from the time of this post. Send me a message if you still need someone in case I forget.
---
Br√∂ther, may I have some m√∂ds?
---
Or maybe they add a role play server kinda like how they added survival. Maybe there‚Äôs an in world chat.
---
Oh wow, thanks for the warning!
---
Hmm, I know you could loot them before, even if you didn't get a shot in, but I wonder when it changed. The only thing you wouldn't get was xp. Oh well.
---
You might have to move your camp an inch
---
Need to upgrade it and make it like Bianca.
---
Golf Outfits at the Whitesprings. You'll find plenty, especially at the Golf Club.
---
I wouldn't call it a nerf
---
Take the paint off. Fix it. Then paint
---
Damn.  I didn't even have a turret destroyed and am and countering this problem.  Did you ever figure it out or are you permanently stuck at 9 out of 10?
---
üò´
---
Do you know that this works for sure? My camp is Built-in a specific place and moving it would mean a complete rebuild.
---
They took Fallout 4's build system, broke it and put it into 76. Fits perfectly with the rest of the work done on 76, broken...
---
they're all at Grafton station except robot and marine.
---
you'll have to go elsewhere for their deep pocket plans.
---
That‚Äôs what I did. You don‚Äôt have to be on a team or friends with the person.  Just go to any event and wait for someone to cry for help.  It took less than 15 minutes to me to check that one off my list when I started doing that challenge.
---
That might be as useful bug. Can you still play?
---
Imagine a bunch of super powered robots that look like several smaller robots melted together, maybe each arm is the remnants of a mr handy, full of saws and flamers
---
Yeah that's my plan, make it pokey. I probably have too many plants too but farming is an important and logical part of surviving...
---
actually, if I was in camp, minding my own business, and all of a sudden I hear and see a group of well played raiders coming over my fences, jumping all over the place, shooting and cursing (but doing no real damage) I think that'd be glorious, and heart quickening and good for a laugh..
---
..maybe they'd leave bags of fertilizer all over the place or something...
---
I'd be ok with all that :)
---
I didn't say it's terrible or not possible to implement in the game. Repeating: it's an amazing idea. I would love to have my own Mr Handy.  I just hate how they implemented those scout bags for example. Why in the freaking hell it is not possible to share or drop the backpack even though it is not atomic item? Where is the logic of that restriction since the developer doesn't have any profit from that? Maybe my economic education leads me towards those narrow thoughts, but still it is strange. Hopefully they will recognize the idea with Mr.Handy. Would be awesome.
---
Ill give you 5k caps right now
---
I had mine at the entrance to my stairs. A girl complained that people wouldn't like that so I moved it to the roof deck. I still hear the grunt of people walking thru it. LOL
---
Indeed I leave those bag quiet a lot
---
Turrets take up a lot of budget, unless you have a small 1x1 shack you wont be able to make a huge amount
---
I think it would be really cool for Bethesda to do a weapons update. Overall rebalance of everything, but also some new weapon mods to flesh out some stuff that didn't get so much love at launch (black powder line, crossbow, etc.)
---
I can help you out. IGN shankwell
---
Vendor
---
Lol how you pick a server?
---
Stimpak one that heals
---
Server-wide alert sent to those that have OPTED IN at their personal terminal or via their Pipboy...  Don't spam people who are not interested.
---
Doesn't need the flare...just simply allow people to OPT IN for notifications of events they've completed before.
---
Near overseers camp is one place but it‚Äôs a pain to get
---
Aye, mine is 50% chance of freezing when exiting crafting scene. I think it's server lag.
---
Itll take more resources but this is the only way. Paint it normal, give to the other player to fix, give it back, repaint it.
---
my god Todd Howard has done it again
---
Hehe, I like this just today I found a house that looked similar to your house in FO4. It had a baby's crib a dead Mr handy and a radroach on the toilet with a wedding ring!
---
Maybe they are playing guard and keeping spawns off them cause fast traveling to bases seems to spawn enemies more now.
---
If we get a medbay, I hope they give us a feeding trough and water fountain too because scrolling through aid to find food and drink is boring. Personally I go to bed to recover HP at home, but it would make for some RP fun and save time.
---
Surprised it wasn't implemented with Ever Upwards though it seems odd that they only have 2 scout ranks but a banner for a 3rd rank (Squirrel Scout). My guess is we will get more ranks in the future and the Compound Bow will be added.
---
In world chat or text would be great. But again, would those who want to offend others abuse it. Of course.
---
 A complete server for role playing seems like overkill, since that's what Adventure should be.
---
I dunno.
---
It will for any of your explosives, including tse as far as I know
---
May they get no stars drills till the end of time. Wouldn't want them to have stars for scrip.
---
Wait, I just looked the enemies killed by my turrets at base last night. We're you close enough? I think proximity when killed plays a role. I was sitting in my base.
---
What are you trying to say? That people eat dog food? Because me and my 50 cans would like to agree.
---
Speedy receiver
---
Extended magazine
---
Gunner Sight (or something like that)
---
Prime receiver
---
Large bayonet
---
Oh and Bethesda's response was to play the quest line over again.  (and again and again)   I have done this 4 times in 3 days.
---
If you still need help, I need to revive someone too! PS4: Avatar_Moss
---
Speedy Receiver, long barrel, sights (theres only 1), large ammo capacity, and a spike for bash (whatever it‚Äôs called).
---
The long barrel is usually the last one you‚Äôre gonna unlock. Today I scrapped like 10 gatling guns and didn‚Äôt get it sadly
---
The auto doc from fo4 (or 3???) would be cool.
---
Where can it spawnin the Golfclub?
---
Go to the cryptid event when it spawns! People die like flies there... Just hit one up with a stimoack and it's covered. You don't have to bee in a team to get it. And if they die it in the pond there, you can get the scout swimming revive an ally in water thingy too!
---
.. isn't there a feed trough with the Brahmin? could always share with them ;)
---
Dont disrespect your mule!
---
Not in game yet. Cheaters on oc got into the dev room and a lot got banned for it. Gotta wait on console.
---
Yes, they have trained bees tied to the bolts.
---
Of if you shot a flare, it would be good if it would highlight you on the map for other players and allow them to fast travel to you.
---
Heat death of the universe will arrive before that finishes reloading.
---
I was within a few feet yes.
---
I'm going to have to try this after getting (2) 3\* Buzz Blade / Weed Wacker pieces of garbage on consecutive rolls.
---
Exploding bowie knife
---
Hey someone already helped me but if you need it I would be more than happy to help
---
LOL. ... nice!
---
I like your thinking here. Haven‚Äôt seen it pop on Xbox for a while but will keep my eyes open.
---
Haha quite the contrary, I want him to once again be useful (also enjoying the fact that he can fast travel, would like for him to see the world again and not be confined to his CAMP)
---
You should move some points over to Luck. If you have hi Per, Agi and Luck you can interchange rifles and pistol.
---
.45 smg. Oh you can farm them near Watoga? I might check out that place. Got lucky, had 2 smgs and scrapped them and got the supressor mod learned!
---
I have a 3 star level 45 smg with +50 damage resistance while aming, +30% against muties and the classic +25% faster fire rate!
---
Lol. Yes i agree i have been keeping my mule hostage in the nuka cola factory since i created him. Hes like the blacksheep of all my characters.
---
How big is giant? Asking for a friend.
---
Please tell me if you can get up on the roof of Fort defiance that way.
---
filthy!
---
Yes, I can confirmed. Two hours ago I spent 100 points and got a assaultron head of 3 legendary effects. Then I logout and went for dinner. When I logon back I found the head has 2 legendary effects only... I was about to scrap it but the machine does not have enough points for today so I left it until tomorrow... I think I will leave it in my inventory for now and see if Bethesda will fit it can give me back an effect so I can get 40 points instead of 15 points...
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
You can always try, I haven't.
---
I would say it's a last resort
---
I like the idea, unfortunately everyone has whined and b\*\*ched enough that now we have pacifist mode, etc. Be ready for a "no pvp" server-wide adventure mode soon.
---
I‚Äôm good, just wanted to lend a hand.
---
Upstairs on the display shelves next to the stair case there can be 3, in the shop downstairs theres 2 or 3 and there‚Äôs also one that spawns next to some snooker balls and a triangle in one of the shops running down the side by the golf club.
---
...dick...
---
I can confirm that's just a random magazine spawn. Last time I went there it was a tesla science. Aside from the nuka tapper you get in v76, all of them are found randomly from robco magazine spawns
---
Yessssss
---
This is an awesome discovery. 
---
I think it should be modded by bethesda so it doesn't work in power armor, but I hope they don't take it away.
---
im not sure everyone is aware of the strategy? that is probably it..
---
Why give that to the crossbow when you can make the syringer have a purpose?
---
You must be part if the good boys
---
Baseball uniform also works. One can spawn at Charleston Firehouse but I'm not sure where else.
---
That kinda sucks. I want them all. :)
---
I'll be on in about 30 hours.... Not the greatest timing but if you still need help by then - I got you üôÇ
---
Or an entire bolt made of bees, and they sting too :D
---
I haven't tried it in power armour because I'm out of cores but if I get one I'll give it a shot.
---
That one spawns quite a bit there.
---
no
---
plus i already got scammed in this fashion so i wouldnt jump at this
---
I found a legendary radroach for the first time in 400 hours earlier this week, and a legendary firefly last week. I did not know those could even be legendary. I've seen plenty of radstags though, but only the glowing ones
---
In case the others haven't been able to help you yet, you can usually find a loose crossbow at the archery range at the Palace of the Winding Path. The archery range is on the far south side of the compound, past the water pools and whatnot. A crossbow usually spawns sitting on a table there.
---
I think this will solve my ammo problem
---
Well till then we ride!!
---
Any spotlights?  They also count towards the turret max.
---
Found it thank you :)
---
Yussir, I've been playing since patch 8 - about 180 hours under my belt - that stag is fairly frequent for me just beside the gold club.
---
I don't like miniguns in general, they consume too much ammo... but this one converted me to a minigun user lol. Damn it's so much fun.
---
Maybe has to do with the purveyor moving. Via tunnels.
---
Ok, thank you :)
---
"If I knew then, what I know now."
---
I know I'd slow my game down a ton. I'd definitely take my time, and listen to more holotapes, read more computer entries, try to piece the story together more than I did.
---
 I prefer story over shooting and somehow I lost that vibe in my game...
---
How‚Äôd you get so many Gatling guns?
---
As a new player i would like to ask something on that matter.
---
I play in pacifist mode and never team up because i am a filthy casual with very limited playtime.
---
What options do raiders still have to waste my time? 
---
And speaking of profits. How do you make profit as a rader in this game?
---
I want to roleplay a rader myself when i reach endgame. ( So sometime 2021) But i want to go the Ashur way and try to "raid" and hold Workshops for profit but leaving everyone else in peace as long as they don't cross my plans.
---
Are you praying to RNGzus before each roll?
---
Used the plan i bought from a vendor
---
Doesn't it suck to be so weak-minded that you can't handle the fact that not everybody in the post-apocalyptic wasteland wants to be a leaf-eating weakling? It's soft people like you that has made this game into a trading sim. Poor baby.
---
Me too!  Gamer tag Teed Wallard
---
I was thinking the same, but didn‚Äôt find any tunnels or ways to complete the quest.
---
I think the first and hardest might be to find two *** legendary small guns that don‚Äôt suck. At that point you can max ammo smith and the associated dmg perks. 
---
I like small guns, but only found a shotguns to be worth a shit for damage. 
---
It would be fun if there were good powerful pistols, smg, or combat rifles. But I have never seen it. 
---
I abandoned my original plans to become a melee build  cause it‚Äôs the easiest way take down everything. No ammo farming, fewer carry weight issues, rarely use PA so lack of cores only becomes an issue occasionally.
---
Got impatient waiting for you to reply to reply üòÇ It worked.  My turret numbers were still glitched, but it made one of my turrets that had gone invisible reappear. Thanks!
---
Most historical crossbows were rather small. They were a cheap and easy to use alternative to traditional bows. The big and heavy crossbows were siege crossbows and we're only used in very specific circumstances, because they were extremely complex, expensive, and hard to use.
---
In my case, the person was right on me, not looking at ferals
---
No. Random bug.
---
That kind of misses the point if automation though, if you have to create unique robots then your costs go up as you need to reset the schematics of production each time. Automation is desired because the robots can be mass produced for specific tasks off one schematic.
---
The two places we see robotic variation in 76 are the military and at whitesprings. The only 2 places that can really afford variation.
---
For all mods available, see my post here:

---
When was the last time you played? -- They take up next to no budget, and in almost every base no matter how big I have been able to build 10 (the max).
---
Why are we praising outer gods in this thread? I mean, im not complaining, just curious.
---
Looks yummy.
---
The budget is still somewhat, not as big as before but it still takes up budget.
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
That's a reference to this episode of Monster Factory - https://youtu.be/_1jGnFt78H8
---
Have you tried not disconnecting from the server and doing it in one go??
---
I had an issue with Freddy spawning, but just kept walking around the shack until he spawned. Hope you get passed this!
---
yup, I've tussled with him, and have the hoof shaped scars to prove it :)
---
I know the glowing one is there all the time, but a legendary one?
---
RIP Fix it good and Weapons Artisan 
---
Those nurfs have practically killed those perks for me
---
Just an FYI I had all the mods for the gat and in the last patch they fixed the ring sights soo they actually lined up with the screen. By doing that the large magazine becomes half of your screen and more annoying then useful, 250 bullets seems to be just fine for me since I removed it and the reload isn‚Äôt even bad
---
No it's on the far south of the map near to the dump site with the big concrete spikes.
---
grenade with a bayonet
---
you just did it..
---
start a thread on reddit and someone will offer to meet up and help.. hopefully
---
Nuka tapper is in the terminal in your room inside vault 76. If you've left already, you'll need to create a second character to get it and transfer over.
---
Grognak can be found in the grafton dam. Below a broken bridge. Up on a platform by a dead body.
---
These 2 ate static spawns and always there (except grognak if someone already grabbed it. Server hop and go back)
---
The other are completely random. Farm magazine locations and eventually one will spawn.
---
I'm talking about getting the 3 points back to reallocate into something that's actually still useful.
---
I agree the budget is small, but since they patched it a few months back building turrets really isn't an issue. ( At least compared to how it was shortly after Beta). If I wasn't heading into work I would post a picture of my new base so you could see. It's actually pretty big.
---
Lol, that's alright, he's pretty tasty.
---
All I get is a quest marker over the Purveyor's head but can't do anything other than trade.
---
Just message anyone in your game 9/10 someone will help you. And if not I play on xbox my gt: Tops Bloobie. I'll help anyone who needs it.
---
From my mom-scientific experience I seem to level up at the same rate. I am level 162.
---
Yeah I got a vanguard leg something something yesterday
---
I thought you can't damage other players with cars? be them on your team or not.
---
Seriously!?! Time to get drunk.
---
What parts i can build legs and torso
---
What are you talking about, fallout 76 is dense as fuck filled with buildings. Name an open world game denser than F76? RDR2 is definitely not it, you can ride your damn horse forever and not hit a town but people excuse it because it‚Äôs supposed to be a simulation of the old west. Well shit that‚Äôs how West Virginia looks too, lots of mountains and forests. I‚Äôm really struggling to think of an open world more packed with locations that the fallout games
---
Agree. Should say vendor does not have enough Scrip do you want to continue. That way you get the daily allotment fully. Also do think 200 a day should be the daily limit.
---
Some people might not know how to holster their weapons, not always an option in fps games
---
I‚Äôd love this, I guess it would need an activate switch though so folk that are riddled with disease because they‚Äôre using the plague walker mutation don‚Äôt find themselves cured by accident when they visit
---
I mean, I can make that easy enough with mod but I won't be on till the evening.
---
Rofl! Of course more is better ü§£üëç
---
I just asked random people to team up. I sent them a message, even though I have a mic. And just asked them to let me revive them. Then if gave them a full leather pocketed set of armor and some stimpacks. 
---
Add me: Necroprison
---
Work shops are the main way..and trap houses and you get caps equal to lvl here
---
Yeah, if it was something you had to get inside of to activate, like the Bio-scanners that are already in the game.
---
I got a legendary 2* frog that came into my base and it dropped a instigating board 1*
---
   I was honestly surprised when we didn't see any changes to the crossbow when the pioneer scouts originally came out as it seemed like a perfect time to change it and maybe even add a unique one behind a quest, event, or vendor.  Really, outside of cosmetic changes copy pasting most of the stock and sight options from the hunting rife wouldn't seem that out of place or difficult.  The crossbow limbs honestly only need a couple of mods and could act like the receiver mainly focused on changing the fire rate.  Then the barrel is where they could have fun adding a bunch of interesting effects to the ammo.   I made a small list of my ideas because (like the syringer) it seems like something they wanted to have fun with but kind of didn't get fully fleshed out.
---
Crossbow Mods
---
Barrel (Basically what kind of bolts get fired, focused on adding different effects to the weapon. Added as a Barrel mod since adding different ammo types is never going to happen)
---
   \-Standard (Deals all the damage upfront)
---
   \-Explosive (deals AoE damage, changes the weapon to loud)
---
   \-Poisoned (Deals additional poison damage over time)
---
   \-Flathead (Deals additional bleed damage over time and slows movement)
---
   \-Stun (Deals additional electric damage, has a chance to stun on hit)
---
   \-Flaming  (Deals additional fire damage, ignites a small aoe \[think a very small Molotov\])
---
Limbs (Mainly focused on effecting fire rate to damage)
---
   \-Light Limbs (Increase reload speed, lower damage)
---
   \-Standard Limbs (Standard)
---
   \-Heavy Limbs (Lower reload Speed, Higher damage)
---
Stock
---
   \-Standard (Standard)
---
   \-bruising, forceful, precise, etc.
---
Sight
---
   \-Short/Med/Long Scope
---
   \-Short/Med/Long NV Scope
---
   \-Short/Med/Long Recon
---
With the cannibal perk. An unsociable one, on the other hand, would ask on here for a team up ;)
---
I'd love to help :)
---
Standby for dm
---
What I'm interested in, does each armor piece roll the 75% chance individually, or once as a set.
---
It's an old bug, easiest fix I've found is to unequip the reequip your weapon
---
Still there?
---
Where did you find it buddy?
---
Look at Division 2 for how to do this correctly.
---
First, this should be opt-in, opt-out kind of a deal. It would be on by default, but you can turn it off and never be bothered by it again.
---
Second, once you call for backup, everyone (not even necessarily on the same server as you, if Bethesda's system supports this) that is still opted in gets notified, and can respond to the call. 
---
This is really wonderful in Division 2, because if you run into any kind of trouble, in mission, doing a bounty (hard boss) in the world, or capturing a control point (fortress, which can scale in difficulty from normal to heroic), people are often willing to hop in and help you. Works amazingly well. And if it's not your cup of tea, opt out, and that's that.
---
That would be perfect üëç
---
When the dev's of the game compliments your build and idea I don't think it is greifing as it is obviously part of the game and intentionally in the game. Otherwise the devs wouldn't have complimented the first person to post one on this subreddit.
---
I know this post is a bit old now but I just wanted to add that The Messenger event has rewarded me with some great stuff. My one main character got the stimpack recipe at level 20, then I got it twice again later. I've also got the psycho recipe as well as fury recipe from it. 
---
It might be worth nothing that each time I got one of those recipes, it was always in the Ash Heap.
---
Don't forget the short NV scope.
---
It probably was just broken
---
Well I actually have a nice TS plasma pistol and a 3* AA pipe revolver so that's the only reason I was considering pistols. 
---
But then I also have 3* bloodied Gauss rifle which makes me think maybe I should try out a bloodied rifle build. Aaahh the choices
---
Yw
---
This isn't actually allowed here anymore. I'd try /r/fo76bazaar
---
I am not 18+ but my parents dont care but im from sweden so timezones might mess things up my psn is pappododo
---
FF14 was updated to work on PS4, so it's not like it can't be done...
---
But, odds are Beth focuses on the Main Games, and let other Companies/Licensees create the spin-offs.
---
It‚Äôs delicious*
---
FTFY.
---
GTA definitely has huge wide open areas that aren‚Äôt any fun to be on on foot. They‚Äôre called highways. GTAV is filled with tons of massive wide highways and if you ever flipped your car in the middle of one of them, it would be a nightmare to get off the highway and onto your next location on foot. Ever tried taking the highway to your next mission on foot? Of course not,  you‚Äôve never done that you‚Äôve always stolen another car right from the middle of the highway and continued on. And why were you able to steal one so easily? Because the highway is a huge empty area designed specifically for cars, not people to travel on. Just like the guy said
---
If you were on Xbox, I‚Äôm selling the plans at my camp
---
And the suppresor, dont want to alert the scorched
---
You have to calculate it dont randomly submit. Calculate jt.
---
But...Jetpack......
---
All terrific prices, but as someone who buys MAPS when I see them, you really could charge more for the Savage Divide ones. Forest for 25 is good, but SD and even MIRE maps are way more coveted by us treasure hunters. I auto-buy 100c SD maps, consider it when I see them for 150, and will even buy Forest maps at 50c or less. This market continues to grow but may have an expiry date after the Plans from the SD caches are all acquired by most of the concerned player base.
---
Well this both gives people who don't have the jet pack and want to see if the crossbow can be useful something to do
---
I was literally just at Whitespring, in the Forest zone, and got murdered by lvl 68 charred ghoul things. How is that right?
---
id be way over 25k if the ceiling didnt exist, but since it does im hoarding more stuff to lower my caps. This seems counter productive to the idea of caps being limited for server strain. But then again of the ceiling was higher id still be doing this, it‚Äôs a destructive cycle. 
---
Definitely too low currently. A few hours of legendary farming and you can hit 10k a day easy server hopping and vending.
---
Ya I realize that now lol. Took me a few times messing up but I still think we should be able to exchange something for the remaining amount if we screw up and choose to take that small hit.
---
What about Camp Tags?
---
You can have up to 3 of them, say Chemist, Repairs, Medic, etc. 
---
Or Player Titles, either ones we can earn, or a list of pre-approved options?
---
Those are the only 2 solutions I can come up with.
---
9 or 10 inches.
---
[Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a17b1c/exp_required_per_level/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) to other posts talking about it. Looks like its a tier system.
---
I get a lot of freezing whilst sorting out stuff in my vendor machines atm. Also, at station vendors. Get massive spikes in cpu usage (monitoring all the time on another screen).
---
It definitely scales up.  I'm 519 now and I'm fairly sure my levels are harder to get now than when I was in my 300s.
---
No you shouldn't. You could lose your hair at worse. Ghouls are people who had something with genes and instead of dying they turned into ghouls. Player's character have "normal" genes and if he have look like ghoul then he should turn into one BUT that would be game breaking cuz ghouls was healing by exposure to rads so radiations could stop being such pain in ass.
---
I find that for armor, im getting armor based on what i wear. ... Vangaurd.  Out of 13 rolls, i got 2 really nice things...  The rest were junk.

I can understand why getting a compliment on something clever feels like it's condoning that behavior but many people throughout history have harmed and griefed others in very clever ways following laws even. 
---
following rules and being clever does not mean it's not griefing.
---
I'd say use a DB for opening combat with a sneak attack then switching to Combat so you can deal better DPS.
---
Reflex scope
---
Repeating (like Chinese one)
---
An Arbalist version
---
Explosive heads
---
Tranq heads
---
Incendiary heads
---
Etc
---
Usually ill submit and it if doesnt calculate right as long as you didnt exit the screen you can buy back what you submitted and pay it back. Usually ill do 3 3* weapons and 40 each so 120. Then you can do 2 2* weapons at 15 or 10 1* armors at 3 a pop or 1 2* weapon and 5 1* armor. Lots of combinations.
---
In NV, Deathclaws were Abominations, with Tunnelers and a few other enemy types, flare guns made them run away.
---
Not sure what they'd be classed in this (or FO4), since they're not Cryptids.
---
Are you serious?
---
It's weird how some weapons have like 30+ mods (they even added more mods to the weapons that were reused from 4) but then some others have literally zero. Or only 1 or 2.
---
As a mostly unarmed player, it already sucks enough that I only have 7 weapons to choose from and can't use them in Power Armor, but on top of that, all of them barely have any mods to speak of. Power Fist has two, Deathclaw Gauntlet has one. The Mole Miner Gauntlet doesn't have any at all afaik?
---
I don't expect every weapon to have dozens of mods but I think 5-6 each isn't too unreasonable. Might even give people more reason to experiment with some of the less used weapons.
---
Because they're worthy of our worship?
---
Sure thats good! When you can you be on?
---
I made a character on my step daughters ps4. Logged in on my ps4. Had the other guy stand near some lvl 1 ghouls and waited.
---
 It took a few tries. The other character died a few times without being able to be revived.
---
Ok. I might not be able to get on this evening. What time are you thinking?
---
Lol I traded all my legendary items for a shovel too...are the melee weapons worth it?
---
Can you make it with the pocketed mod?
---
Rofl! I've never actually bought the items back. Now THAT  makes a lot of sense. I'll have to do that next time lol
---
Most of my drops are vanguard.   Of course, i wear vanguard, so I think that helps.  Try wearing 2 or more pieces of your desired armor, and give it a roll.  You may find the luck turns in your favor
---
Go to a Scortched Earth event, someone will fall.
---
Yeah dude. First day i had same predicament. Left 1 scrip in there. I was so mad seeing 999 scrip
---
I‚Äôve got the exact same problem and it happened after patch 9 because before that I could hear people just fine. Now I can barely even hear them. It‚Äôs kinda annoying when someone is talking to you but because you can‚Äôt hear them you have to basically ignore them because you don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre saying.
---
Only four stories tall at the moment, but I have a plan to wedge my CAMP on a ledge somewhere, that should give me space above and below instead of just above like I have it positioned now.
---
Same. I don‚Äôt like the HUD.
---
Uh, honestly I don't know.
---
But everybody knows Cthulu, Ug-Qualtooth is (I think) the Fallout version of Yog-Sothoth, and Shub-Niggurath needs more love.
---
As much as I enjoy this game, I can't see it having a long lifespan.
---
It's made based on the engine if assets of another game, and made as a "space filler" to be between releases of the major Bethesda stuff, like Fallout or Elder Scrolls.
---
I could see this game having another solid year, and maybe a little more, of content, but once a major title is on the horizon, support for this game will start slowing down
---
Ya just got one from mom. Even has low carry weight. Significantly more power and dps than combat shotty. Its almost auto.
---
Haha ya I get that. I didn't quite max mine out before she came. I ended up with 900.
---
Still got 2 explosive weapons from her anyway though üëç
---
That's not what Mr. Hands say
---
Give it to both!
---
I have the firebreathers outfit how much you looking to spend
---
My psn is gofukyurslf326 message me
---
You can still place it so you can fight outside the zone at the bunker. Probably newer players or non-unarmed builds. Sad really, it would save them 1000s of ammo.
---
Is this your response? Like I said name one game denser than fallout 76? GTA is not it, you can count on one hand the number of interiors in gta v you can enter
---
The servers are still bad and crashing after all this time? I played 76 at launch and got bored and decided to check out the sub. This is one of the first comments I see lol
---
It does seem like Scout Armor has a higher chance than other stuff.
---
On my first day, out of 16 Armor rolls, 6 were Scout (2 right legs, 2 left legs, 2 torso). So, what, a 37.5% chance from that math?
---
I guess it's actually not so bad, considering it's the only source of Legendary Scout armor.
---
It is. Was at an Aussie guy's camp this morning, some real cheap stuff and an interesting location, only realised after 3 minutes he was talking to me about the items I'd bought and why they were cheap etc. Only caught the last 30 seconds or so after turning volume to almost max (on a powerful set of speakers with subwoofer) so I just emoted back which seemed so trite and I'm sure I missed a great experience there.
---
This and the same thing when selling items to a regular vendor. Sometimes I am happy to get something instead of having to carry around that 20 lb. fat man.
---
Have died several times and had no respawn point....
---
Yeah, you go to the top floor through the powered doors (unless the power's off, so the other way turns it on), use the computer, abort the can, read the Journal, and head to the DMV.
---
Funny. I have a 2* silenced gauss and it‚Äôs the only gun I use. My only issue is that leveling is slow AF cause I‚Äôm more of a stalker than a tank.
---
Individually from what I can tell.  And it is noticeable.
---
Hopefully it gets fixed in Patch 9.5 on Tuesday. Because it sucks not being able to hear someone who‚Äôs talking to you.
---
Now if someone would do this for the new vendors we put at camp cause the prices are crazy. I'm tire of looking up prices which I'm sure they are guessing at .... price check on everything lol
---
The Heavy Weapons are also lacking in the mod department, especially the MG42.  All it has is the Prime Receiver.
---
Thx! Will do!
---
Is this your response? Like I said name one game denser than fallout 76? GTA is not it, you can count on one hand the number of interiors in gta v you can enter plus there are miles and miles of open wide highway which is just empty space not to mention all the GREEN on this map. All empty space

---
Its a pitty that im on PC, because I got a lot of profit from raiders and griefers ;)
---
Yes please! Atleast a dot sight.
---
Yes, I found one in the cranberry bog early in my play through.
---
First - let's start with the question of what do you consider "Passive"? And can you guarantee there aren't ANY applications that can be used in combat or help you avoid combat? Is a perk that doubles the effect of Alcohol or gives you +2 luck when you consume alcohol combat related? Luck gives you a boost to you filling your crit meter.   Is hacking a terminal when you are under fire from turrets to turn them off a "combat application"? 
---
Second - You're not looking at it from a game design perspective - the concept of a build is that as a player you need to make choices and sacrifices. In most games, that decision to be good at lockpicking means you aren't going to be good at something else.  If FO76 was desigend like your standard game with builds, you are stuck with your choices and at best you can get a full respect but in the end you still have to make choices. 
---
FO76 was built with flexibility to swap cards but was the expectation that players would be swapping that often? Did they make a mistake in giving us that flexibility to swap on the fly?  It might not have been designed with the intention of letting us just swap in those "passives" when we wanted them
---
And you say it's the "dumbest" idea, but the whole idea of passives not needing to be slotted doesn't even consider what characters would look like and power level would be like at the end.  Everyone keeps saying "Lockpicking" and "Hacking" but are those the only passives? What about the good chunk of endurance perks? What about things that let you harvest 2 from plants? What about things that let you search for ammo, chems, food, caps? How does this work if you have a low stat - can you have a 3 PER and have a 3 star perk and an infinite amount of "passives" from perception. What "Build" will there be for characters after they are in higher levels and have every single perk.  What about perks that allow you to repair better? Or what about perks that give you a bonus to CHA for the number of people in your group?
---
Now you can argue this happens now and peopel simply swap out the perks, but the idea of "passives" takes it a step further because no one has come up with a solution that takes into account how they would balance high level characters that had every perk and kept stats low.  
---
So it goes back, Is the issue that we need to have passives or is the issue they were too loosey-goosey with the way they designed builds and if they make a change people might not be happy with the outcome.
---
I think my new alt still has the fire breathers. If so, You can have it.
---
I believed they already announced that PS5 would be fully backward compatible.
---
The station was boarded up before to where you couldn‚Äôt get in from the inside, when you go in you find a boarded up hole with some junk and a further tunnel you can‚Äôt reach, its very likely the mole miner vendor dug her way in and set up shop, thus the seismic activity. As for completing the quest welllllll, maybe you have to trade with her or something?
---
Thank you for the advice. I'm just trying to look into this and tweak it before building a character off of it so it's not a character yet either.
---
About an hour
---
My usual experience from traveling from point A to point B through the wilderness is just to press X and play a phone game for 5 minutes. No enemies, no anything, just plants to pickup.
---
A game? Any mmorpg out there. Lol
---
I have yet to find even a single random encounter, something that was a staple in this series.
---
Sry dont think so
---
I asked this question because i saw a deathclaw transformed into a scorched deathclaw but the name was still deathclaw.
---
Tops Bloobie, is that perhaps an Adventure Time reference?
---
I hope not. I read they change on a Tuesday.
---
Did you forget about all this green empty space north of the city in GTAV, that‚Äôs all the type of area you‚Äôre complaining about in F76
---
Agreed. The only time I'd think we would find crazy variants on the robot enemy types would perhaps be around Watoga or some such place with a nice dungeon area for automated construction. Perhaps the AI running the production has begun to degrade or evolve in some way. Maybe MODUS decides that simply deploying Enclave-brand robots at bot-stops isn't enough and tries his hand at hacking a more capable production facility (make it a big quest). 
---
Also I think it'd be fair to see a spiky, rust-and-blood covered variant of the vendorbot Protectrons for the raider factions. Maybe give the Free States vendor Protectrons a bandoleer or some sort and berets. Give them a bit more personality than just a nice paint job.
---
Yes please
---
That hasn't worked for me so far, I tried completely shutting everything down and starting again.
---
I never said anyone had to dedicate to their life to the game.. I'm just saying that it's an open world/exploration game and part of exploration is discovering things for yourself. I don't think it'd be pretty fair if you could just spend caps and get the same achievement as people who've gone through and found it themselves. I play the game casually but I've found a good percentage of magazines in the way. There's perks that aid in doing so. Why waste caps on them?
---
Strange, I haven‚Äôt seen any creature get turned into a scorched variant like that, but it makes sense with scorched lore
---
That makes a lot of sense. I‚Äôve traded with her but the quest still remains. I‚Äôm getting the feeling that this is the new impossible to complete quest. I should have known killing enough feral golfers at Whitesprings would come with consequences haha
---
All lights share a 50 item limit. Im guessing you just have too many other lights.
---
Lol YES. and you are the first person to recognize that!
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, those are good ideas, but encryptid is your best bet. You don‚Äôt need to worry about dying, as the encounter is scaled for level 30s or so - I‚Äôd just not become a pylon. 
---
You could try the queen too, and focus on the fodder.
---
I got u bro
---
Full auto would be nice. Also a tactical frame could be pretty sweet aswell
---
Thank you redditors! Mission accomplished!
---
Boomstick
---
Duh! Forgot about that spot. Thanks for the reminder :-)
---
THANK YOU!
---
You truly are the Hero we need!
---
I found it when I ran from Vault 96 to Federal Disposal Field HZ-21 on the main road on that extra curvy part uphill. I have almost discovered every location while 800 kg  over the weight limit :D Thanks to the small stash space.
---
I'm just a guy
---
Camp tags sound reasonable. Bethesda could give us a short list to choose from: Bar, Medic, General Store, Restaurant, etc. ...not too exciting, but could give much needed info
---
Good idea. u/ladydevann
---
A long blade for increased range
---
Male character, I just put on a ratty dress and sun hat to look pretty ghoulish.
---
Maybe buff the crossbow first
---
The developers congratulating them on what they made absolutely condones it. That is literally what that means. So no, doing something in the game the developers intended isn't griefing just because you don't like it.
---
Take the same advice everyone in this subreddit gives people who complain about it being an online game, quit playing if it bothers you that much. This is part of the game, just like the online part.
---
yeah the one that spawns in whitesprings sometimes was scorched the other day
---
It was like a bug. I found it in Abandoned West Dump were you start the Enclave quest. And out of no were it transformed in a scorched deathclaw but the name and level din't change,only the skin changed.
---
Nice, lol. Figured you had a legendary because you didn't mention crafting and scrapping, so thought it was worth a mention.
---
I‚Äôm definitely getting more than normal. I got three 3* pieces in a row that I immediately sold back :/. I just wish the mods had plans to build them so I could actually keep some more pieces of this crap.
---
That's damn near perfect
---
The whitespring is a high level place, you need to stick to the TOXIC VALLEY OR ASH HEAP at your level.
---
sounds good! best of luck ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
It's an informal (no actual certification process) way of referring to supposedly [top-notch studios](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA_(video_game_industry). Kind of like the phrase "Rockstar developer", just a shorthand marketing speak way of suggesting something is supposed to be high-quality.
---
I can‚Äôt say I know anything about the cost. What I would suggest however, is getting some XP boosting items if you really need to level up still. 
---
Such as:
---
Feed the People (5% from food item which may or may not be made of the Chinese intelligence‚Äôs shit)
---
Resting in a bed (50%)
---
Cranberry Jam (5%)
---
Playing in survival (20% - but be very careful if you get in the top 3, you will likely be hunted by tryhard PVPers.)
---
This is how knives are sold in London, quite amazing how they've been incorporated into the game quickly :-).
---
Dude let‚Äôs be real here. We live in a day in age where everyone HAS to be special or everyone else will melt. Everyone gets a trophy, Everyone gets a ribbon, everyone gets to be special, lest we have a million triggered snowflakes melting over the fact that they aren‚Äôt getting to be as special as everyone else.
---
Bug since it came out, hopefully they'll fix it soon
---
Ok sure ill be there. My gamertag is TruJoe_ what is yours?
---
Press the action button on the purveyor even though it‚Äôs not indicated and the quest will complete - on PS4 I press X
---
Pappododo
---
100-999 is supposed to be the same. This is a pretty old post, so they may have changed the leveling since then.
---
If you build your turrets on camp items like tables or shelves, you can scrap or store that item to get the turret back. If you place the turret on the ground, the only fix is to move your camp.
---
This is great! lol
---
And also there is one question at the archer badge exam which mentions what to do when someone took an arrow to the knee.
---
There's also another Skyrim reference in the Scout Exams, where one of the questions [has a scout get "shot through the knee!"](http://imgur.com/cPRqZC1) And then one of the (wrong) answers is to advise Ricky to give up on adventuring
---
Thx
---
Your usual experience is to just fast travel from point A to point B? So how do you expect to run into random encounters if you‚Äôre fast traveling everywhere? Random encounters are tied to specific points in the map and there are tons of them. And you‚Äôre jus my bypassing them all to go straight to your destination
---
Damn, there goes that theory...
---
Tell him not to log in on that character for a full 24 hours. I had an issue where i would join and get a black screen with disconnected from server. Until then he should get on an alt character
---
I only use melee for the most part
---
Oh I gotcha yep that makes sense thank you!
---
+karma
---
Plan is uncommon.   Best bet is to go to trade subReddits.  Probably will cost 1000 caps.
---
Yes there is. I've also found a few scorched ticks that lived with normal ticks and didn't attack them. This is a bug because scorched animals are aggressive to the kind that they previously belonged to, right?
---
I just asked a random person at the camp and he was nice enough to jump off a cliff until they died.
---
I dont think you know how much money online games make compared to a single player games.
---
This game is already made. Just keep tossing in quests/ items and new dungeons. The shop gets a lot of use and f2p games run the same kinda model. I could see this running for years if they keep up like they are doing.
---
Its sad it released in the state it did but many ppl are hearing the good and coming over. Myself included.
---
I usually go back with chameleon armor and kneel on the side
---
No clue, if it's a junk item it might work?
---
Hm ok thank you
---
It‚Äôs not a quest, it‚Äôs a way of telling you the new vendor is here
---
It's really much better, to the point you'll see more and more posts like this one asking for a bigger budget.. because there's so much issue with servers.
---
They do server restarts fairly often now, you're much more likely to have that than crashes, at least on PS4.
---
#raiderlife
---
Sounds like a gang. Are we a gang?
---
Only with the instigating effect in a nuke zone at the WS
---
Great!
---
Was thinking that too, but it just happened a few times in a row  right after the latest patch and I havent launched a nuke i a while so I started thinking they might have changed it....
---
Ha ha yeah I went to two of them and they both took over 20 minutes because the unarmed guys were very seriously gimped ...
---
Been a while since I participated in a Sbq fight that lasted past 5 minutes ...
---
It's not the same. You still gotta farm legendaries to get scrips. If anything this update helps unsaturated the market because there is a net loss. To get one 3 star legendary, you gotta scrap multiple legendaries.
---
Yeah, sorry, just checked mine is a 2 star TSE level 50
---
So you can't read huh? Weird, they should be called 'fixed events' then. Oh wait, the game has those already. So theres 2 kinds of fixed events. Cool, I hate it.
---
That would be dope, and there are a few broken ones scattered throughout wv, so it wouldn't be unbelievable that the vault 76 dwellers, being the "best and brightest", could fix one up and use it
---
How much do they sell for? With boosts I get 25c for witch costumes but they need cloth, rubber and plastic.
---
One miss with furious and the damage resets. So, a shotgun has 8 projectiles in one shot. They may stack with each other and/or trigger furious 8 times. But most likely one projectile will miss and reset the furious effect. I haven't tested though, so this is only conjecture based on knowing how shotguns and the furious effect works on other weapons.
---
I'm not talking about medieval crossbows. This is Fallout, not The Elder Scrolls. I'm talking about more modern crossbows like this: https://i2.wp.com/alcambronne.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/modern-crossbow.jpg?fit=1096%2C809&amp;ssl=1
---
I would love a full range of bows with different types being governed by different special stats.
---
I'd love
---
Longbow/Recurve: Strength for the draw muscles
---
Compound: Perception-the sniper build with string silences and scopes.
---
Crossbow: According to the wiki I think they have them listed under Rifles...I'd move them to pistols and agility.
---
My personal bow dream.
---
We're gonna see Skyrim for PS5 before we see ES6 and you know it.
---
But then you might take an arrow to the new and your adventures would be over.
---
The first one I went to during the quest to unlock it took me to somewhere north east of vault 76, there was a table set up in the forest with food, drink and other items all laid out on it. It reminded me of Sheogorath's quest in Skyrim when you first enter Pelagius' mind and they're sitting at a similar table.
---
I think this is most well rested I‚Äôve been
---
Scorchbeasts are classified as both scorched, and beasts. So both hunters and zealots works on them.
---
The only other enemy that double dips are scorched bears, who are likewise effected by both.
---
I was thinking the same, just thought I had read something about them changing how tse shotgun pellets are counted. So I was curious if that would have had an effect on furious stacking as well.
---
CAMP repair kits, basically.
---
2* frog? Crazy times we live in...
---
Good point. I always forget I can‚Äôt when I play other games
---
Damn sarcasm almost drew me offsides
---
Perv for short.
---
griefing is harassing or irritating players in a game using in game mechanics . This can be done following the rules and quite cleverly. Bethesda could comment on it being clever. it doesn't mean they feel it should continue though. changes have been made to prevent this from happening since beta: slap damage gone, camp damage removed, survival mode started...these were all in game things people did and in some cases it was griefing so changes were made. 
---
it sucks I can't put turrets up to defend my camp from actual mobs because I don't want it to attack actual players and become wanted. I do want to defend my camp though. alas, I'll repair after it gets destroyed by mobs a couple times a day instead.  (I'm saying in addition to the griefing people that exploit in game mechanics to grief players they are actually also ruining this function so players using those things legit can't even actually defend their camps)
---
but until I actually see Bethesda say "we want you to be able to harass people on adventure mode by pvp murdering them when they aren't engaging in pvp or purposefully becoming wanted"  I'm not going to believe they want you to do this. they have made changes since beta to to try and prevent this. they have survival mode for this. everyone willingly participates in pvp action. all bets off go to town. that is not what adventure mode had intended or the survival mode would not have been made.
---
I hope you have a good day sir.
---
Here's a few ideas.
---
Rapid Fire Mod:  Gives the crossbow a magazine of 10 bolts for semi auto fire.
---
- Increases weight.
---
- Decreases damage.
---
- Very slightly increases durability.
---
- Decreases reload time.
---
High Tension Mod:  A much stronger firing system increases the range and power, but also increases the strength needed to load each shot.
---
- Increases reload time.
---
- Significantly improved range.
---
- Significantly increases damage.
---
- Slightly decreases durability.
---
Composite Stock Mod:  Replaces the stock and some mechanisms with composite material.
---
- Significantly decreases weight.
---
- Improved recoil.
---
- Improved range.
---
Quill Launcher Mod:  Changes the ammo used to special quill bolts made from sheepsquatch quils.  One quill can make 10 bolts.
---
- Uses special Quill ammo made from Sheepsquatch quills.
---
- Adds poison and bleed damage.
---
- Decreases durability.
---
- Slightly increases weight.
---
Knife Thrower Mod:  Something raiders cooked up, this mod changes the firing mechanism to use throwing knives for ammo.  Some say a Bowie Knife mod was in the works, but the crafter died while testing it.
---
- Significantly decreases reload time.
---
- Significantly decreases range.
---
- Uses throwing knives as ammo.
---
Nuka Bolt / Nuka Quantum Bolt Mods:  Modifies the firing system to use special Nuka / Nuka Quantum Bolts.  They take the idea of the grenades with the same name and miniaturize them onto bolts.  Ammo can be crafted with 10 regular bolts, the beverage of choice, and fertilizer.
---
- Increases Damage / Significantly increases damage.
---
Stinksquatch Mod:  Why just shoot someone with a bolt when you can shoot them with a poison bolt?  Same idea as before, this fires poisonous bolts made from regular bolts and spoiled food.
---
- Uses ammo made from spoiled meat/fruit/vegetables
---
- Significantly decreased damage.
---
- High poison damage for extended period of time.
---
- Slightly increased reload time.
---
- Slightly decreased durability.
---
Taser Mod:  fires bolts with electrical capabilities.
---
- Decreased damage.
---
- Additional energy (electricity) damage.
---
- Chance to stagger enemies.
---
- Decreased durability.
---
Field Medic Mod:  Take healing to the next level and confuse other survivors.  This changes the firing mechanism to use stimpacks for ammo.  Not stimpack bolts.  Just stimpacks.  Feel the joy of healing your teammates by shooting a stimpack in their face from the top of a small building.
---
- Does no damage.
---
- Uses stimpacks for ammo. (only regular stimpacks)
---
- Heals target player.  (would be the same if they used a stimpack, whatever bonuses they have apply)
---
- Significantly increased reload time.
---
- Significantly decreased durability.
---
- Slightly increased range.
---
I‚Äôm now excited to possibly become a squirrel
---
I actually think I was wearing 5 pieces of Unyielding, but didnt get one ... Ahh well, RNG is a b****
---
Thanks
---
Yes my poor shitgun collection ,... yes I said Shitgun it‚Äôs an fairly accurate description now
---
It went away after a while. :( It was a cool visual though.
---
my gt is laidbackleo87 add me and when you see me on shoot me a message, we'll go to the lake in whitespring and ill down myself with an explosive weapon, then you can revive me. that will give you both revive another player, and revive another player in water, two birds with one stone.
---
Ok just let me know when you are getting on
---
Along with Mordoni's tags suggestion, I've seen people in the thread suggesting we be able to name our camp/vending. If we could do that we could add our own tags, too. "\[RP\] Furiosa's Flux Fineries" or something lol.
---
As soon as they give us the ability I assure you and all like you I will build as ramshackle a hovel as I can humanly manage.
---
U posting wouldnt effect that
---
Safe n clean disposal right next to ws
---
Sure it would. If  they arent aware of how good the weapon is and no one tells them then it should be fine. If I post about it and they become aware then its "Abra Kadabra your weapon is shit".
---
i feel you, im to afraid to talk about my favorite effect for this reason because of fast fire weapons
---
I love this idea
---
i got a 3\* glowing radstag there before, only dropped 1\* loot though.
---
I don‚Äôt think you need to worry about this at all.
---
Nope
---
Im sure they know already
---
i found my plan in the watoga vendor on thursday. iirc it cost like 300 caps?
---
I'm curious what emotional reaction my own builds evoke, lol. Hopefully not too much disgust~
---
I recently started a new one and loving it. My first was a weird rifle/ melee build with my perk cards all over the board. Classic case of can do many things but none well. This one is a stealth sniper.
---
You know, it is funny...I am level 180 playing from beginning.   Still learning something new about this game!  A little knowledge goes a long way.  Still having fun!
---
It has to physically walk to your camp and it takes a while depending on how far you go
---
This needs more upvotes
---
Have you *tried* a legendary black powder rifle? Hits really hard, a minute to reload between shots lol
---
Hey, you. You're finally awake. You were trying to rebuild Appalachia, right? Walked right into that Nukashine still, same as us, and that
---
ghoul over there.
---
I mean at the max level it its 18% that's one in five shots considering one shot can kill I think it should be lower for pvp
---
it is quite loud
---
Tell that to 2 shot, explosive, assassins, sentinal, Cavaliers, white knight, gunsmith, and makeshift warrior.
---
I think it depends on your location. I've had 2-3 builds in the mire where things were quite chill.
---
I havent seen anyone talking about it at all. Not one post and I'm on here all the time.
---
Looking back, it was clear this was the start of Billy's dark path that would define his life. Bullied on 76,it affected him in a way that forever changed his psyche. He promised himself that when he got to level 100, they would fear him. And they would pay.
---
Good idea, the way they could do it is to have ghoul options unlock in the player appearance options after something like being at 50% rads for so many in-game hours.
---
I came across someone's farm the other day, they had about two dozen corn crops, the same of blackberries, a dozen razorgrain and the same of mutfruit. That wasn't what amazed me, it was how close together they'd been planted. And they still had budget left over for a medium sized house.
---
My BF, sister, and I went over to Site Alpha and server hopped till the yao guai spawned, then let it beat the shit out of one of us.
---
I wanted my character to look like me and as a person who actually lives in Appalachia I do have a long beard,  striving to get to Tormund Giant's Bane level of ginger beard but not there yet.  That being said my beard is longer than the longest one in the game so having longer beards as an option would be great.
---
However, I was wondering if anyone noticed this, in the change appearance menu if you change the character's beard to the longest one (last option, forgot name) and then when you come out of that screen does the beard appear to be noticeably shorter to you compared to the appearance screen?
---
TOOOOOODDDDDD
---
also, Cranberry Relish (+10% XP)
---
They call me 'Giantsbane.' Want to know why? I killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife. When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk.
---
Alright that works, I just would hate to have it disappear if I move my camp
---
I think that‚Äôs the one I meant
---
Still bugged. I doubt they‚Äôll patch before the next scheduled patch session.
---
Weird.  What is your rank in luck?  Mine is 12.
---
You don‚Äôt think those armors and weapon effects were a little OP and needed balancing out?
---
Google is hard
---
Yeah I know the feeling - I moved mine and i was like nail biting the whole time until it finally showed up
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
The odds of getting any one combination of 3 star armor effects is 18\*10\*12, or 1 in 2160. Though I am pretty sure there is an error in the wiki and there are actually 11 second star effects, with disease resistance being an effect, but bugged and displays as incorrectly granting radiation resistance, making the odds actually 1 in 2376
---
There‚Äôs only one I‚Äôve found and it was south east of the mothman museum
---
Like a bunch of mr handys that somehow got liberty prime's code and welded themselves into an ugly, mangled megazord?
---
This is why I sometimes wince when someone talks about how good an exotic is on the Destiny sub
---
Back when the fasnacht event was going on I used to just wait around Helvetia until the parade event stated. Once it began, I would fire off  the flare gun trying to rally as many people to event as I could.
---
Oh I was thinking it did both
---
Haha when I saw a bicycle at sutton station I thought the same thing
---
Does that work in 76? Can I use a flare gun to scare away stuff?
---
Short and sweet.
---
Or.. They could just add possibility to jusy turn into real one?
---
If you‚Äôre still looking, I‚Äôm in the same boat as an antisocial player who desperately wants a backpack. On Xbox: MoonUnitBeta
---
I've spent a few hundred hours in the wastelands of West Virginia, and I've loved almost every second of it. It really depends. What do you enjoy most about Fallout games?
---
The tadpole archery test has a question about what to do if someone gets hit in the knee with an arrow and one of the answer choices is ‚Äúadvise them that their adventuring days are over‚Äù or something to that effect.
---
Mindi, Myrtle and Matilda. (Name of Brahmin)
---
The perks that got nerfed were only nerfed so that they could sell more reaping kits, they weren't OP. The other stuff did need balancing but instead they were just totally destroyed. An 80% ner on the weapon effect is way to much and the armor affects not stacking and also only working sometimes makes them about as effective as normal armor.
---
The wise mothman is another xp boost. You get it at the lighthouse after an event.
---
I can help!
---
Yeah there is an outfit that matches all hats.
---
It‚Äôs by far not perfect but it‚Äôs really fun and all the expansions are free
---
Browse the subreddit , this gets asked in some form constantly. Read the opinions and decide from there.
---
Forgot that lol
---
Are you dense? The traps work exactly as intended. They don't need you to "agree to PvP", in fact, if you just stay away from parts of bases you aren't welcome in, it's a non issue. In other words, mind your business.
---
Wish we had crossplay, just got the torso crafting plan last night but I'm on Xbox
---
I found that place, too! On the ridge east of the Fairgrounds. Always assumed it was a reference to Alice in Wonderland with all of the hats in the chairs.
---
Here the breakdown DB = more damage output with constant reload CS =bigger clip with les damage output
---
Thank you so much!
---
It's haunting IRL you because last time you launched a nuke you must have looked up the codes on Reddit rather than hunting down all of the ghouls.
---
Nothing worse than having something good they say oops its to good we are going to weaken it to the point its useless and youll get nothing for it but hey just use another item and keep playing! Its the games way of being that idiot on here that tells people to "get good" its funny that this game had a few builds you could use and now everyone just runs a bloody build. Almost any higher lvl player i see has no health when i look at them. Can the rest of us have fun too??
---
Awesome how much easier the hats are to find. üôÑ Thank you!
---
Personally, I think the game's fun and always has been. I've had it since launch and I guess I've been lucky because I've never encountered a game-breaking glitch that's made me despise it. I've always found it enjoyable and with the new content they've been releasing lately I still have stuff to do. I think it's worth buying, I don't regret buying it, but I also don't think you can rely on someone else's opinion to say for certain whether you'd like it or not. Maybe try watching a few livestreams or yt vids of the new content and see if it's something you're into then decide whether or not you'll spend money for it.
---
You're so correct!

There is a lot that goes into building something that looks nice and is also functional. Especially so when it comes to designing something that is for multiple other players to use - you need to consider things like pathing and access to stash boxes (for example, you want to avoid having people have to ever run past one another to access a stash box when crafting) among other things.
---
11 to 12 caps each but again I easily do this each day
---
No, it isn't. It's annoying maybe, but don't be dense. Just because you don't like something doesn't make it griefing. Duh.
---
Really? At the watoga train station?
---
The mad hatters tea party?
---
I‚Äôll give that a shot when I log back on. Thanks!
---
Right. I have found 1 thing that is as food as TSE used to be and it's even more rare but I refuse to talk about it because I dont want it to be nerfed into the ground.
---
Personally the AAE sounds like the better weapon, Instigating is nice but if the enemies have taken even just slight chip damage you're doing less DPS overall. My 2¬¢.
---
AaE shotty no doubt
---
yup, i noticed it when they added .50 hunting receivers to the vendors
---
Theres an autodoc and a terminal with several entries about how effective it is in Harper's Ferry. That could be a cool addition
---
It‚Äôs EATT love.. we feast on our enemies who first initiate battle or wish to do harm. We (most of us) do not wander looking for unknowing victims to have for dinner.. in the literal sense. We wander, helping just about anyone we come across.. dropping random aids, weapons and scrap at their feet.
---
So, before you wrongfully judge us, maybe you should drop in and see what we‚Äôre really about.. üçΩ üç∑ üñ§
---
I did a run through checking the entire place, every container, and found 11 hats and not one outfit. Lol I have a friend who has ever outfit but she bought them from people here and there...  She just got the yellow one yesterday and completed her collection.
---
After a brief pause in the fight, you were trading with the guy?
---
Or for people to just use it as fasttravel spots
---
I just walked thru that house yesterday!
---
I do not agree with you
---
Ooh that was me psn zonkerbl
---
The game is fine, you obviously haven't played it.
---
Flatwoods Monster nearly always spawn going into Charleston from the north/west - it's before you really even get into the city - big cliff drop off next to the broken road and a single house just before you actually get into Charleston. I always find one at the bottom of the cliff attacking the mutants or scorched in the building.
---
Mothman is 100% random. Search 'random events map' on this sub and click on the one that thanks Mappalachia üòâ It made it pretty quick.
---
Hell fucking yeh!! Fuck opinions, fuck everything... Buy it and make up your own mind. Then make a post about your experience.... Then when your ready, come and test your skills in Survival. Its in Beta but the thought someone following you or that someone realises your following them is awesome. There isn't need for OP armor either anymore in survival as it got nerfed, just your wits and a good gun.
---
I agree at this point im over player vending on account of how crappy the selections are. I would go to every camp now, im selective. Im tired of thinking someone has lots of armor but nope, it 10 halloween costumes and 3 baseball caps all at 500 caps but hey do you want this half eaten fusion core only 300 caps.
---
Update: it seems to be working just fine in Area mode. Not ideal for clandestine conversations with your team mates but hey.

I want to empty my 800lbs of stash weight. Trying to balance pricing so that it moves quick, and I still make a little. I pretty much bought everything I want, so I‚Äôm not concerned with having money

I rarely ever see Monongah or Thunder Mountain powered up so, personally, I don't think I've ever seen it happen

He probably ran out of stealthboys.

What‚Äôs your IGN?
---
I hate explosive shotguns. I had (still have really) a furious explosive shotgun that I liked to whip out in emergencies but the splash damage from the explosions always felt like it was doing more damage to me than the bad guys. (I know: dense, fireproof hahaha whatever. Not my build.)
---
That being said anti armor is the better shotgun hands down. The instigating only does bonus damage with the first shot but the anti armor does bonus damage with every shot.
---
lol yes
---
Just wondered if we were so preoccupied without quest to slaughter each other we were missing something cool by not working together...
---
Even when there's no one there the ghouls are still high level FYI.
---
That post should be stickied, thanks for sharing.
---
Just attack the ghouls a little get them to follow you to a camp. Let their turrets kill them and you can get credit.
---
Wait what? Never knew about this fountain
---
IE for most pve ... put the wear and tear on that one for most things you'll be fine. AAE for anything serious or big armor. I advise this just for QOL so when you need the AAE you don't want it to break immediately.
---
Just attack one then run to the whitesprings robot, they'll take care of them and help you level up.
---
cant have people FT all over the map for free...
---
[](/tiadisapprove)And then sometimes there will be nothing but level 100+ players in a server, and the ghouls at the springs are all level 9. Sometimes this game is confounding.
---
Only two that I was happy with. Anti-Armor Gamma Gun, and ‚ÄúWhipperSnapper‚Äù my old man cane. Hunter‚Äôs cane with extra limb damage
---
They can be 3 star but don't go above level 40.
---
Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs available yet. I bet we get a lot more with Project Paradise since it has to do with animals in the specific biomes and what not.

M/32/Appalachia: Just looking for someone to make monstrous babies with.
---
Furious is the highest damage affix in the game, it just takes 30 bullets without hitting a second target on accident to get there. It ramps up to 150% damage vs bloodied at 60-90 and instigating at 100 (for 1 shot). That being said, even if you don't get to all 30 shots, 10 shots is the same as junkies and most full auto guns hit that in around a second.
---
I‚Äôd be happy if they just allowed us to mod out crossbows with different types of arrows
---
It will make the journey. It has taken over an hour for mine sometimes...but he walks slow haha.
---
Incisor is the single best damage perk in the game.
---
costs 3, and provides almost as much benefit as 9 points worth of straight damage perks, and is not melee class specific.
---
Yes armor piercing effects on weapons stack with perks to reduce armor more, but multiplicatively.
---
Example, a level 68 mutant with 200 armor (rounding for easy math)
---
Incisor reduces by 75%, down to 50 armor
---
Puncturing reduces the remaining 50 armor by 40% (either 40 or 20, from what I remember of an old datamine post), down to 30.
---
The big question is when do you not need more armor piercing, and the answer is when you are dealing damage per hit of 6 times the armor value or more.
---
So against that hypothetical 30 armor if you are dealing 180 damage per hit it the armor is irrelevant, and there is 0 difference if you add more piercing on top.
---
If you are dealing 300 damage per hit then the piercing effect of the puncturing rocket is irrelevant, and makes no difference whether the armor is 50, 30, or 0.
---
If you buff up through all possible methods to wallop the enemy for 1200 damage then you don't need any armor piercing whatsoever, you simply don't need to care in any way shape or form.
---
The point where incisor is less useful than the weapon mod is when you can boost your per hit damage up to 720. If less than incisor, if more then the mod.
---
Can you buy the non Legendary pieces from the Enclave vendor and scrap to learn mods?
---
Cool!  So they added them back?   All that‚Äôs missing is dense armor plans and casual shielded, then.
---
I was hoping that a nuke would be launched before I lost it to test it out, but sadly no
---
I did it yesterday at the encryptid event.  Wasn't even thinking about it - I was just reviving people that needed it.
---
Grape Mentats.
---
It used to not be a problem for me, but as of the last 2 weeks I have about a 20-30% success rate for entry. Really getting bothersome
---
Bethesda would like to know where you are
---
Nah. Make the crossbow the one for damage and the stronger the one for utility
---
Are you on right now - I have it
---
yup! only 285 caps with hard bargin 3 and 6 C here is a SS of it: https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/sgtmajfoiey/screenshot/12148872
---
Remind me what that perk card is?
---
I have killed that same Radstag there before and got a 1\* Grognac Axe
---
It would be amazing if they did an expansion and see the capitol wasteland 200 years earlier, before megaton , before tenpenny, but then it might ruin the wasteland we all know and love without any NPC's
---
At least it wasn't a drill.
---
You still cant vats them, they still get sneak attack damage when you are looking right at them.
---
Been getting a lot of anti armor lately and I am grateful. Plus people have had some good deals lately. Got a AA Tesla and an AA hunting rifle with limb damage.
---
Ya that's what I figured, I'll just have to be patient.
---
That‚Äôs fantastic.  It was effectively MIA for quite awhile.
---
Why not, player camps aren't everywhere
---
I got a nocturnal trolling pin from Free Range. I dropped it on the ground, said 'get over here', and used the give gift emote. :-)
---
Uranium Fever is actually a good place for two reasons:
---
1: You usually get at least one \*\*\* boss, which means a chance at a \*\*\* item, and while it might not be max level, if it's a good enough roll it's better than a max level \*
---
2: And if it's not a good roll or a \*\*\*, it's purveyor food.
---
Im not
---
Yes, indeed
---
I found a new spawn in front of the gorge junkyard down the way from the vault
---
Haha imagine a level 1 player fresh out of the vault fast travelling to pve of the camps in the cranberry bog or mire
---
no, I'm not dense. you're not understanding. fast traveling to an advertised base for vending is not breaking into a base and ransacking it. 
---
you don't go shopping at Walmart and expect them to shoot at you, do you? the parking lot isn't rigged with explosives when you drive in. you show up to buy since it's a store advertising things for sale.
---
if you break into a locked door that says "manager only" you expect to be detained at the least. 
---
if someone sets up vending to lure a person in and a person fast travels ONTO or into a trap not intending - that is griefing. if someone is picking locks and breaking into camps then traps should stop that. people have a right to defend their camp. turn off vending and lock your doors - case closed. someone poking around uninvited should not be. that's not what I'm suggesting at all.
---
my first comment specifically states i have traveled going to buy at vending and fast traveled into tight quarters ...I would have been very upset if that had been a trap and I had been killed. that is not the intention of traps.
---
purposefully luring someone into a trap to kill them while pretending to vend something is griefing. when you turn vending on to let people know you are selling you are supposed to be selling things, not luring into traps.
---
if you rig your base up with defenses and someone trespasses and picks locks and becomes wanted etc it's fair game. that is defending your camp NOT griefing. as I have stated numerous times.
---
yep.
---
Doesn't the bloodied meat hook beat this under the right circumstances? I saw a screencap of just over 10,000 damage with it.
---
Does it work with the Nexus? I haven‚Äôt been able to find any information on how to mod
---
Good point, lol. But then again, the curse should extend to also give the same 1* legendaries. üòú
---
[](/tia)Do you have a source on that? The highest recorded buff I could find from furious is a 50% buff, and it's disputed. Most people say the cap is 30%.
---
Not always. If I log out there and come back in, the ghouls will all be level 9ish, with maybe a level 32 crowned boss. It seems like the game spawns the mobs before it fully loads in your character, so it treats you as a level 1 for the sake of the surrounding enemies
---
They‚Äôve really only nerfed 3 weapon types: Two shot, explosive and (not really a new nerf) explosive shotguns. 
---
TSE weapons were mass duped and everybody had them. It was ridiculous and had to be corrected. I think they could revisit this now, but it shouldn‚Äôt come back to anywhere near where it was. 
---
Explosives weren‚Äôt really nerfed, but the demo expert perk was. A better solution would‚Äôve been to just not have that perk apply to explosive bullets, but again, the direct result of mass duping of TSE weapons. Hopefully they revisit this. 
---
The explosive effect on shotguns should‚Äôve been corrected with the TSE nerf, but it somehow slipped through or was bugged. Before the fix, you could snipe someone from 100m with an explosive shotgun, you could just shoot the ground and they would die. It was utter nonsense. Shotguns aren‚Äôt rifles, they‚Äôre not long distance weapons. Post-fix, if you are close, you still absolutely wreck things with an explosive shotgun, but it‚Äôs much less effective at distance and you actually have to hit what you‚Äôre shooting at‚Äîas it should be.
---
They haven‚Äôt touched melee or bloodied‚Äîas I think both of those have clear negatives that are easy to counter, but I suppose time will tell. 
---
High ROF ranged weapons seem to be the current PvP favorite, but even they‚Äôre not that hard to counter, so I don‚Äôt see a nerf as an imminent threat there either. They also give players without legendary effects a chance in PvP, so again, probably not such an awful thing.
---
Why is there a mounted house cat are we killing cats now?
---
Just port the code for the horses from Skyrim, don't mind the neighing bikes.
---
You're comparing this game to the likes of an MMO or Battle Royale game.
---
It has nowhere NEAR the same player base or microtransactions, or the same amount of investment by its head company. It's not the big flagship title or major money maker. It's a side, one-off game, like Fallout Shelter was.
---
It's a simple game that didn't take a large amount of development time and that can reel in some funding while the company works on it's next big thing. If it turns out to be more successful or show more potential than anticipated, the bigs wigs will throw more funding to add more to it. It's what happened with No Man's Sky.
---
Again, it's not that I don't like this game. It's been one of my most enjoyable experiences. But you need to see it for what it is, so you don't build up unrealistic expectations, like so many games on the past few years have been victims of.
---
Yeah, I am 89.764% sure we're getting robot companions. (with a grindy repeatable for robot plans)
---
Got it already but thx for your offer!
---
This is why most, if not all of my atom shop purchases have been for player items (or free camp stuff)
---
I think they only drop as very rare event rewards in some areas. The only outfits I know to be world drops are the white outfit and weathered white outfit
---
Store your junk away and go to the Cryptid event.  If you die, you're just giving someone else the opportunity to revive for the quest.. There's a puddle/tiny pond, dying there would help even more people out, because of the quest revive someone in water.
---
I'd prefer it make a 5min long fast travel point that way if your out doing something and you need help or a friend wants to join you. You could fire it into the air and boom they can fast travel strait to you
---
About tree-fiddy
---
It stands to reason that if you can see it so can they, defeating the purpose of being cloaked in the first place.
---
Immersion wise, if it were to exist it would likely be a headpiece.
---
Same, I‚Äôve been going through every square inch of that place pretty painstakingly but no dice on any outfits so far. Plenty of hats, though. That‚Äôs awesome that she has the full collection!
---
...what? bethesda isn't going to nerf something because you get a good drop lmfao. they only nerf things when the majority of the community is constantly complaining about it being broken to the point of ruining our fun.
---
I would say 10-12k.   Would be worth a whole lot more if not a minigun.  And you might try the trade subReddits first.
---
I can't recommend this enough. I used to have this issue. My first few camps I would build these beautiful homes that looked great from the outside, with halls, rooms, attics, basements, courtyards, and the like. When I was done constructing and time came to decorate I would complain that my camp now looked awful because it was an empty mansion with no budget left. I've since switched to a small bunker-type build and I was able to plaster every inch of the walls in decor, with furniture filling the entire space. It's smaller, sure, but it feels much more like a home now. I even have 10% budget free to tinker around with things.
---
good ideas!
---
No, unfortunately. Would be pretty cool to get that feature back (along with some flashbangs)
---
A collective of people have been experimenting with damage and armor resistances. Then one very talented individual took the time to build [a website](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html) to calculate those damages and factor in resistances as well as buffs/perks/chems/etc... It's an ongoing project so it's not complete, but they're always adding more. It's not all 100% accurate, but I'd say it's about 95% accurate. The only inaccuracy I've found so far are some of the guns rate of fire.
---
That‚Äôs good to know, thank you!
---
I assume Jezz_x is just saying the camp limit is in place to assure server stability in general, not that the servers are still bad and crashing.
---
Although the server disconnects/crashes are rare now, in my experience, the game itself still has a lot of performance issues. Those issues are mainly FPS drops and stutters and game crashes. Especially when a lot of people are in the same area (at the encryptid event for example). As long as you are playing the game on a low pace it‚Äôs okay.
---
Shoot bullets at them? You don't need to use vats  all the time. And yes you can hit people even if they have marsupial.
---
Yeah could be, but Sheogorath was my first thought when I saw it.
---
GT - RubyStatue778
---
It‚Äôs hilarious people are hopping like idiots when shooting lol it looks funny.
---
Does anybody actually read the cards ?ricochet does not work in pvp
---
I git the critical .50 chamber plan. Still need to test it out to see if it does more damage than the 308.
---
This would just make me fast travel to camps instead of locations that are a few meters away from them just to save a few caps.
---
I could easily save a few hundred caps a day doing this.
---
When being a dick in a role playing video game means more than being an asshole anywhere else
---
Nuka Tapper can also spawn as a random like the others. I have 2 atm, got the 2nd from 1 of the 3 mag locations at the Sons of Dane compound.
---
&gt; griefing is harassing or irritating players in a game using in game mechanics .
---
Exactly, harrassing requires repeated and continued attention from them towards one player. Just building a camp with traps in it, isn't greifing.
---
&gt;Bethesda could comment on it being clever. it doesn't mean they feel it should continue though. 
---
When they said, "we love this build and would **love to see more of them**."
---
Emphasis mine, that absolutely says they want it to continue and it is intentionally part of the game.
---
&gt;camp damage was removed
---
Yeah and everyone warned the people wanting camp damage removed that death rooms would become extremely popular because of that. But no one listened. Bethesda has already said the death rooms are cool and they want to see more of them. So no that definitely not griefing when the devs themselves want to see more of it.
---
&gt;but until I actually see Bethesda say "we want you to be able to harass people on adventure mode by pvp murdering them when they aren't engaging in pvp or purposefully becoming wanted" I'm not going to believe they want you to do this. 
---
They literally did in the first post someone made of one of these, that is the point I've been getting at. They literally said, "we'd like to see more posts of these."
---
Imo melee should be touched down just a tad. It does have trade-offs that guns don't, but melee already has the massive advantage of a direct (and significant) damage boost from unyielding armor that guns do not have. I know a bloodied melee build is extremely risky to run, but getting damage in the high thousands is perhaps a bit much even for that risk
---
What do bloodied weapons do??
---
Try a bloodied crit build. With unyielding and bolstering armor you can rise pretty much your SPECIAL points. Also I would quit some points from strength,endurance, charisma and intelligence and put in luck, per and Agility. There are some really OP builds outhere
---
You have to find them in the wild to count. Tired this myself.
---
You mean you‚Äôre not?
---
I thought we were talking about weapon and armor legendary effects, but anyway, I‚Äôve never used tse and have got through the game just fine, if they‚Äôre now around the same level as many other effects then that seems pretty balanced to me.
---
&gt; The perks that got nerfed were only nerfed so that they could sell more reaping kits
---
Citation needed
---
&gt; An 80% ner on the weapon effect is way to much
---
Then why is it still one of the most sought after effects? Almost like even after the nerf it's still in line with the others ü§î
---
&gt; armor affects not stacking and also only working sometimes makes them about as effective as normal armor
---
If they stacked, you would be reaching armor penetration above 100% and cheesing through the higher level mobs. It also creates a perfect balance between anti-armor and two shot. Two shot is slightly worse based on numbers alone, but it's better than anti-armor if you have the right armor piercing setup because of the way those stack. It's perfect the way it is
---
Mobs still despawn randomly with no warning. I've lost several 3\* legendary mob corpses to the void
---
I can agree with you there. Also if you are neighbors and know each other well enough, you can usually use their place while away. My neighbor even let me drive their truck. I wish people wouldn't think of the bad things of West Virginia. It's very cultured and quite nice there.
---
Todd sees everything
---
Definitely is. Saw a post on tumblr where someone explained how they woke up in the cart after taking Nukashine.
---
Completely agree.  The Drop rate for what everybody wants is low enough already, not to mention the spawn rate of the event to begin with ..... then the majority of players get so focussed on a piddly small legendary or gaining xp killing bugs that do just about zero damage (especially to the PA addicts who never step out of their PA), and gain just about the same amount of xp as walking around  . .... gather the damn kindling.  It can't be done by ONE player at the rate the camp fire goes out. 
---
End result 25 minutes wasted  to failure, after another 30 minutes wasted to server hopping.
---
Nice one.. Still waiting
---
That‚Äôs not a bad idea.
---
im barely level 22 but im up to teaming up GT: ISON 12
---
This right here.  You really notice it when you have 3+ Pieces of armor with weapon weight reduction/chem + food weight reduction/junk weight reduction when you hop into any power armor, even excavator PA with dual calibrated shocks.
---
I've got a pretty decent 1 with high damage, just really hate the sights so I don't use it, had fun doing challenges with it mind.
---
True and it does make it easier for some people to act differently when they get out of the vault and possibly learn of new things.
---
I myself learned alot and irl I am military. I enjoy helping out others because that's how I was raised. I would feel bad if I didn't assist.
---
Nice thank you
---
Miniguns are pretty good these days. But yeah 10-12k sounds about right this one.
---
Railway can. Has been done.
---
I can be on in a minute if you'll return the favor
---
think its probably worth quite a few caps im looking for it for a long time in game but havent got one were you got it from?
---
Well I have been holding off on actually attempting a bloodied build. A) the gear is so expensive and b) they seem so squishy. But now it seems worth it because one of my first grabs from the purveyor was a bloodied Gauss with vats crit+50%, 25% less AP cost. It's like a sign!
---
Anyway, thanks for the suggestion. Can you recommend key perks?
---
I picked up the same one at the whitesprings,traded it for scrip.

So you wouldn't check to see if you needed anything for that camp?

Mods are on the Nexus but you don't use NMM to manage them. There is a mod manager made just for 76 but I haven't used it. It's super easy even without it though.
---
You just download the ba2 file from the Nexus, copy it into the Data folder, create a custom.ini file if you don't have one already, and add the name of the ba2 file to the relevant line in the ini. Most mods will have an example ini file you can also download to get you started. I'd recommend starting with Better Inventory and Perk Loadout Manager since they both have very good support.
---
I ...never said building traps to defend your camp is griefing. that is in game mechanics and people should NOT be breaking into players camps or poking around when not invited. I was addressing the lie of a vending machine luring people to traps.
---
if you go shopping at Walmart you're going to buy from a store that's advertising items for sale. you don't expect to drive in and get blown up. you go to shop and leave. people in game that set up a forced spawn to lure people into a trap to kill them are griefing. that's all I said. 
---
if you break into a locked "managers only" room at Walmart you become "wanted" and are fair game. just like any person breaking into any camp should be. I clearly stated if it was someone being lured in with the advertising of selling something but instead killing, it's griefing.
---
it's a clever thought out grief but still griefing. if it  happens to me I may get mad and marvel at it and move on with my life but that doesn't change the fact that it's griefing. seriously, I'd laugh after being mad and say well played to myself and move along. doesn't change that it's griefing though.
---
Probably around 500 caps
---
Thank you!

But...
---
Well...
---
SHIT.
---
I get it from that repeatable BOS quest named Forbidden Knowledge.
---
I'm so tired of these posts. Who doesn't have $10 to drop on this game? Back in my day (yeah I said that) kids bought games and played them. Now everyone's wallets are frigid cause they either want internet points or they're too damm scared to play the game themselves. I bought this game for $10 when it had 1* reviews 4 months ago and I'm still playing it today. Take a risk and just play it or don't or at least use the search function. Life is far more fun when you take risks
---
Ehat about all the perk nerfs as well?
---
Yah I share those feels, sis.  I buy all the atom camp decor I can, but what's the point of all the pretty and decor if we can't even use it cuz of tight budget capacity.
---
100% been having so much trouble with this one. Don‚Äôt know how to do this!!!
---
okey thanks for the info i trade in my technical data every once in a while but im not very succesful getting these
---
any chance you are on ps4 and willing to trade the plan for a weapon or armor piece?
---
Thanks. It is going to take a slot in from my vending machine.
---
Oh. So the majority of the community was complaining about white knight, gunsmith, and makeshift warrior? I must have missed that.
---
Yea but isnt it better to ask if its first buying before wasting the money?
---
Wait I was told this stuff was just cram in a can.
---
Maybe they do count.. I'm sure I'll get another one, see if it does it for my alt. He only has the backpack right now.
---
I‚Äôd say yes, but it‚Äôs honestly up to you to decide. Everyone will admit that Bethesda fucked up bad with the first few months of the game, mostly because of the horrible bugs and connectivity. Now, Bethesda has been making serious changes, banning people for exploiting the game, fixing bugs, and also adding much needed content. I love the game, always have, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.
---
While using a stealth bou and jumping around they have clear unfair advantage.
---
im on pc. :(
---
I am thinking something like john rambo. explosive tips. comes in different forms such as energy, plasma, and different poisons for that biological touch. 
---
a scope would be nice or maybe some broad head bleed damage. armor piercing etc...
---
I got jebaited.
---
I've no luck so far. Three 3* and three 2* stars were just wrong /fails. It'll come, some day, perhaps, or ofc, l hope.

Not sure. There is also a hidden hatch in Huntersville. Good thoughts though.

Explore the Forest area fully then move on to the Toxic Valley, explore it fully as well then move on to the Ash Heep to also explore it fully. Then you can continue the main quest to the Top of the World
---
I was around 24.5k the other night and had to pull the electric from my vendor machines eagerly trying to find something to buy. Ended up getting a BE 50cal for 20k. I needed that cap space in a bad way.
---
what a shame thanks anyways :)
---
Sweet. Didn't know it was also in random. Well that helps. Thanks.
---
They just nerfed shotguns for no reason.
---
Get a team of four and get someone to share ghoulish 3, and another to share rad sponge 3.
---
as long as you stick together it's almost impossible to die.
---
Unyielding
---
Not sure if I have a weapon that powerful. Might have to start grinding for a good rolling pin.
---
This is exactly why I moved my camp to Whitesprings. Natural foot traffic beats 'advertising' any day. I came across too many gougers to be willing to fast travel to vending machines. If it's on my way - cool, if not I'm bypassing it.
---
Unyeilding is good for boosting special stats up to +15 each at low health, so is best for a melee build and vats builds. I don‚Äôt think it boosts endurance though.
---
That's a terrible mechanic...any self respecting comicbook collector knows you get the best stuff trading with other collectors.
---
I got some shitty items. A BP Rifle, BP handgun, a bad Gatling laser, and a pretty decent mini gun that has the 90% reduced weight effect plus some other effects on it.
---
so i checked and the plans sell for 1-5k caps as far as i see
---
Hail Father Dagon Hail Mother Hydra
---
What do you mean locked behind the atom shop? Everything quest related was in there for free? I haven't had to pay anything to start any of those quests.
---
Camp info should also include the owners level. Im sick of wasting caps and time to get to a low level camp that has crap. I've also wasted the time looking for the owners and its such a pain.
---
Is it not the people constantly crying nerf this nerf that causes the nerfs?  Dont focus all your recourses on 1 build. Eventually everything is being nerfed since bugthesda seems to listen when people cry nerf.
---
That's better than the sheepsquatch imposter! Awesome
---
It would be great if all weapons had mods. There are definitely some melee weapons lacking in that department
---
Again, the search function. I see these posts multiple times a day. And its $10. I'm broke as shit but it's only $10. When I was a kid, we didn't have these new fangled internet's to search for opinions on games, we just bought them and lived with our decisions. But if you're looking for a opinion (depending on type of games you enjoy) buy it. The game is playable solo but more enjoyable as part of a community. The survival element is not overbearing and there is plenty to do. The majority of the fun comes from adventuring with others. The story isn't great and can be quite boring but if you're looking for a social hub and a means to hang out with new friends, this game is great for it. I enjoy making money and grinding for elusive gear
---
Thank you for the post man! I'll use my Quad Crossbow for places i cant reach with my marsupial legs
---
Oh nah that's probably the Plasma Gun you're thinking of
---
I'm confused by you're reply. Are you saying the current limitations make sense or are you telling me the current problems that I prev addressed in my post are present. I think cards that you can swap at your benches and use together only to switch them back to your combat cards should just stay on. Or the game switches your cards at a bench automatically
---
A Fallout NV fan who also happens to like 76???
---
TREASON! HERETIC!
---
Not sure if I have a weapon that powerful. My need to grind for the legendary rolling pin
---
wow nice. thank you so much for the info.
---
They could be just hinting at vaults that we will be slyer exploring in the coming months
---
I have got my build vs decorate balance just how I like it.  I only have one turret facing the two spawn points.  I have everything I need placed I think, but of course, if they did give us more budget i would gladly use it üí™
---
good tips!!
---
ugh, I've kept my current one small and still can't fit everything I want. I think location and land around the area may change the budget (ie trees rocks water) but have no confirmation. I have built way bigger camps in other locations with much more decorated and yet when I build on a creek or river and add in trees I feel like it's so much smaller.
---
Because adventure is basically the equivalent of a PvP/Conflict server in any other survival game. Open PvP needs more work in this game and you gain more in adventure, looking at it logically there's an obvious reason to PvP on adventure rather than survival.
---
Isnt that just the boiler switch for the quest
---
Step 1: Acquire automatic, non-explosive, preferably Quad Tesla
---
Step 2: Equip tank killer for stagger
---
Step 3: Aim at ground in the general direction of stealthed assailant
---
Step 4: Watch lightning unerringly arc to their chest piece and reduce them to a pile of ash
---
You're welcome.
---
No, I think it should cost caps AND give a portion of those caps to the owner of the camp.
---
It's to start the water heating system of the teapot at tea Terror event
---
But the Railway rifle does it better :P
---
&gt; I ...never said building traps to defend your camp is griefing. that is in game mechanics and people should NOT be breaking into players camps or poking around when not invited. I was addressing the lie of a vending machine luring people to traps.
---
No one is talking about that, the OP said someone set up one of these death rooms next to his camp by whitespring, nowhere did he say they had their camp listed as trader.
---
&gt;if you go shopping at Walmart you're going to buy from a store that's advertising items for sale. you don't expect to drive in and get blown up. you go to shop and leave. people in game that set up a forced spawn to lure people into a trap to kill them are griefing. that's all I said. 
---
We aren't talking about IRL, were talking about an online survival game. Go play rust, dayz, or any other surival online game. Trading areas are a blood bath in every single one of them because people should know better than to just waltz right up in some random persons camp even if they are offering sales.
---
 Do you also think men in vans all have missing puppies and candy too?
---
&gt; I clearly stated if it was someone being lured in with the advertising of selling something but instead killing, it's griefing.
---
Once again that isn't what happened in Op's story, you are making things up to cry "griefing". When the only persons fault it would be for entering some building without even being cautious in a survival game is on YOU. If you are dumb enough to fall for it, that is on you. Not them for out smarting you.
---
&gt;it's a clever thought out grief but still griefing. if it happens to me I may get mad and marvel at it and move on with my life but that doesn't change the fact that it's griefing. seriously, I'd laugh after being mad and say well played to myself and move along. doesn't change that it's griefing though.
---
Griefing has a very specific definition and setting up traps for random players isn't griefing, especially in a survival game. The only person you have to blame for falling for that would be yourself, not the player who set it up. Just because it makes you mad doesn't make it griefing. 
---
There is zero rules and no reason to even expect that would fall under griefing, because it is literally part of the game, has perk cards designed specifically around the use of them in that way, and the devs have even said they want to see more builds like that.
---
So no, it isn't griefing when it is an intented part of the game the devs have said they want to see more of.
---
Berry Mentats buddy. But they're not entirely necessary. Also, Tesla and wide spread TSE weapons work great. Stealth Boys are a necessary evil, without SBs VATS would be the only worthwhile build
---
I noticed perk cards and armor losing effect. Like sometimes I'll login to a server, be detected and stay in danger (my character is stealth). I couldn't figure it out until one day took out all my perk cards and armor off, put them back. Stealth was back :| Now that's what I do when login. Should script it in autohotkey, there's a load in time anyway.
---
Lol!!!!
---
exactly. I can't even put all the new plans not counting atom store stuff...
---
i find myself in the same predicament. i am not anti social i just don't seem to make friends like other people do. so go start the sheepsquatch event and lots of people die so just res someone. thats what i plan on doing.
---
you could as creepily stalk a low level player for hours till they make a mistake and keel over then res them. i thought about this also but decided it would take to much time.
---
gotta think outside the box. my brotha from anotha mother.
---
I suggest if you want to jump up to them make sure that you Fire about four arrows into each other, the arrows can be slippery so I've four three-four arrows makes a good foothold.
---
Awesome
---
I got three of them in a row today, two of them were left arms and one was right.
---
It can be both at the same time, there is enough buttons to open boilers and open vaults
---
I've never got my hands on one so I didn't know but I'm pretty sure the arrows are bigger than the railway spikes. If they are then you'd have a better platform to stand on.
---
And yeah I agree to both lol
---
Unyielding...melee gets raw dmg. Ranged gets insane perception &amp; agility for vats + sneak. And some extra carryweight
---
&gt;  I enjoy helping out others because that's how I was raised. 
---
Same. I've also been the recipient of a lot of helpful offers. I recently started a new toon and the amount of help I've turned down because people just try to throw things at low levels is ridiculous. I have 3 toons at or above lvl 100, they need their resources more than I do. I'm making a new toon because I've about run out of things to do on the others. If someone gives me everything I need or want on the new toon then why am I even playing it.
---
TL;DR: the amount of help low level players are offered is staggering.
---
LOL have an upvote :)
---
Yeah I've seen that happen.
---
File wise, there's nothing beyond the banner and uniforms. Presumably, we'll get more on them in the next patch.
---
nazaguerrero
---
I actually do it and sometimes it just works!
---
I'm on PC, but I'm glad you're helping people out!
---
I‚Äôve got the same issue but have much less resolve than you and have not tried since it reset despite finding rose‚Äôs intro akin to nails on a chalkboard
---
I build big structures or multiple structures and have tons of room for decorations....
---
Use fewer lights and turrets.... They eat up a ton of budget.
---
You‚Äôll also find them at most SBQ events
---
Instigating +explo not good imo. Splash hurts other enemies = no instigating effect.
---
I want to wear them.
---
no problem my friend
---
Oof, don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôd begin with that one lol... would need them to fix the bug where the owner has to be nearby for you to be able to inspect stuff
---
Thats what i did! Just jumping all over the map and ended up in the bog... Got one marker there and died 6ish times and came back to the forest. Safe :)
---
I tried to read the details again when mentioned on the OPs post but it's deleted. but I'm literally not commenting at all on rooms people go nosing around in where they aren't invited. if you are not invited to a place and you break in, you deserve that other person defending themselves.
---
it doesn't matter if it's a game or RL ...it's people. I hope I choose to not a dick. that's fine if you want to play games like that but that's why Bethesda made the survival mode because that game mode is NOT what everyone wants to play (and it wasn't the game we were sold). now that there are two modes: adventure and survival, that is how things are intended to work.
---
but really? puppies and candy from a van? c'mon...children even know better.
---
Have you tried jumping around with a stealth boy yourself, 
---
Stealth boys are very advantageous, but also not really that rare and exclusive. Unlike the previous kings of pvp the explosive shotguns that were rare, and utterly impossible to deal with unless you got god tier luck, you can just go get stealth boys, they spawn around in a number of fixed locations, and can be used by anyone from the level 5 who just started to the level 500 who's been at the game for a while.
---
as long as you aren't crazy out geared then stealthboys are easy enough to counter if you are prepared. Pop some mentats, a stealth boy of your own, and the tables turn quite quickly.
---
Send it to my house and I'll tell my boys to be very careful with it...I promise you it will look "weathered" in  about 15 minutes lol. Looks great though üëç.
---
Why do people pretend that everyone on adventure just wants to pve. You don't even know how many full groups we run into trying to PvP, and those are the most profitable moments. If I wanted chump change for each kill, and to be killed on sight(or at least attempted lmao), with no chance of RP or talking then yeah I'd play survival, but that's not fun and I'm gonna spend my time doing what I find fun.
---
You need to remove all structures near the stairs to remove them. It's annoying but it's better than ugly. I wish there were better looking stairs, don't know how much it makes me upset to see through the floor with the stairs
---
Mmmm it depends the type of weapons you like to run (I asume you will use non automatic rifles), so in Per tree you can go for all 3 rifleman and antitank, in Agi you can go for all the stealth related perks (adrenaline it's veeery usefull, evasive it's a must) and in Luck you can go for starched genes and masacre (dont forget mutations like adrenal reaction, marsupial, bird bones, etc). On Str tree Barbarian it's really usefull, and on Int tree‚Ä¶. if you play bloodied Nerd Rage it's also nice.
---
For serums, just ask in Market, people usually sell serums from 300 to 500 caps each
---
I disagree entirely.  I never was engaged by the build system in 4 because I had no interest in "rebuilding the Commonwealth" and tending to a bunch of whiny, robotic NPCs.  76 appeals to a more introverted interest.  It started with building my own house.  Now, I can also build a store that others can use.  And there are countless places you can do this - you are no longer confined to one specific build area.  The system feels like it has purpose now and it's fun to build something other players can actually use.
---
Did it once last night and it was working just fine, so good call!
---
A little challenge workaround would be great.
---
Just to get all bugged ones finally done. (locations, magazines(?), badges...)
---
Great paint job!
---
I literally have removed everything in the area but the stairs and the floors can‚Äôt be removed
---
cool. any specific locations you've found it there?
---
Whoah, I haven‚Äôt seen it break that badly... you should report that to Bethesda‚Äôs site if you haven‚Äôt already
---
Yeah you have you kill 50 enemies anyways, just repair after 15 kills and you‚Äôll be good
---
Join Encrytid - someone is bound to need a revive there.
---
Oh I thought you meant you press X to get from point A to B as in you click on the icon and press X to fast travel there. And the 5 minutes were meant to be an insult as to how long it takes to load. Anyway you can talk shit about fallout 76 in other subreddits where they don‚Äôt play the game and claim that it‚Äôs empty and everyone will upvote you and cheer but you‚Äôre literally in a subreddit for the game itself and trying to bullshit people that actually play the game isn‚Äôt going to work. 
---
Anyone that actually plays knows, you can‚Äôt go more that 30 seconds without being attacked by some annoying ass thing in this game and the terrain is so fucked up, rocky, mountainous, and clogged with junk, you could never just set it to auto walk and not have him get stuck on something literally like 5 seconds after. Your complaints about this game are 100% made up bullshit nonsense that doesn‚Äôt exist, and makes zero sense to anyone that actually plays it.
---
for me he was saying White Sheep and he kept saying "white thing gone"
---
No, sorry. They‚Äôre high level ghouls at WS regardless. It‚Äôs a high level area.
---
How about: no
---
Depends on what time you play. Time zones and such. I‚Äôm on cst and usually get done with work around 4 or so. I just like wandering around so I don‚Äôt mind helping you out.
---
Well I guess the Dragonborn didn‚Äôt survive what a shame we could use someone like them to take down these scotched beast so I guess the scotchedborn haha is kidding that‚Äôs really bad
---
Maybe the tunnels will link to the blue pins (I think) on that map in Berkeley station and she will move around? The red pins mark the location of the other normal vendor stations? Just a guess could be a bad one lol
---
Only Beth knows...
---
Not to worry, it's no longer a pvp oriented game. Cant destroy bases in adventure, can't destroy bases in survival, can't defend yourself from a turret base attacking you in survival and the gain in caps in survival exceeds the value in bullets it costs to kill people. If you try the last remaining option which is to initiate pvp for caps in adventure mode by taking a workshop, most people just run and dont even defend it anymore. My friends list is dying off by the minute. fk this game
---
Bethesda said what dropped is it
---
I mean, to be fair, whenever the game chugs for me, it's because it's loading or unloading someone's CAMP.  The rest of the time, it's silky smooth.  So, it doesn't surprise me that A: there are hard limits on these things and B: that the whole "player decoration" thing is taking them a while and/or will be pretty scaled back from what some of us thought it would be.
---
Platform?
---
Scorchbeasts' crop duster cloud transforms all animals inside it into scorched versions of themselves, the highest level variant have actual stat and name changes to go along with this effect, but lower level ones just get the reskin and turn non hostile towards other scorched.
---
small critters that don't turn into scorched like squirrels die outright.
---
Also make sugar bombs it produce useful for cooking
---
Well i just started playing with the crossbow last night since i got one as a 3* drop from the purveyor, a TS with 10% dmg while aiming/ faster movement speed while aiming. Not what i was hoping for but it seems to manage to 1 hit most lvl 60+ mobs with no problem. Not so useless after all i guess.
---
It was a limited time event. Maybe they repeat it next year. If not, they will become pretty valuable.
---
And here I have been making and scrapping crossbows for days trying to get a mod lol!
---
I haven't seen mothy in weeks now. Miss him a little bit...
---
I mean not only because of a wing or a badge to earn....
---
I'm in the UK, so I'm 6 hours ahead I'm sure. So that'd be 10pm here. Could probably play on the weekends and that if you're on.
---
If they were smart, this game would've worked at launch.
---
Or they'd work on fixing the game before adding content and Atom Shop items.
---
Does anybody read the post these days or just comment? I'm the whole point of the post is to suggest it work in pvp
---
Combat knife with a bayonet.
---
PS4
---
Its just a little past the Golf Club Entrance under a little roofed Quartz structure.
---
if you specifically want a TSE, 2 star, you get double the chance compared to 1 3 star
---
If you'd like I can try and help. Psn: Papertattoo
---
I've been running into this more and more lately. Kinda avoided a lot of challenges and quests so i would have something to do when I got bored but now I'm running into bugged challenges and quests. It's rather frustrating
---
Grind SBQ and ISQ events, people go down all the time in those
---
Not sure that has to do with server stability, but then again I've also never had that issue.. have you reported it? What platform? Have you tried using the camera to find the body?
---
I've had bodies quickly turn to meat piles, but never disappear.
---
I fixed the problem but I‚Äôd still like help building the station
---
Yeah, I've always tended on the small side because dense detail is more visually pleasing, and it keeps all the functionality right at your fingertips.  I don't need to travel between rooms to use different workbenches - I just turn to the right.
---
People should keep this in mind when they design stores too.  Don't make me hunt all over your complex for where you put the vending machines.  Stick them all in the same visual frame.
---
Lol. Which platform.
---
Where at exactly?
---
hey 2k caps for it? ive been putting in too many tech data's and yet to get one, im on PC also IGN: Jimusmc
---
Sure thing
---
If all you want is TSE, then definitely go for the 2*.
---
in ps4 everyone selling this mask for 250 caps every time i go to vanding i see it
---
My name is thescorchbeast
---
I think maybe if the do the fasnacht event next year again (a shame if they won't) they will release the other masks.
---
People like you are the reason I kill on adventure lmao
---
Saw a bunch of mole miners attacking some guys CAMP and I killed them all and the guy fell off his roof and that‚Äôs how I got mine. Gave me a bunch of good free stuff too.
---
Yikes.. Well my gt is chillert21 if ya wanna send me a msg when your on and if I‚Äôm available I‚Äôll join up. For sure can do mondays since that‚Äôs my only day off.
---
Damm....Im on xbox.
---
Your talking about the jester mask right?
---
I just really want Kebob mods.
---
I at most have 5k caps, but if all the vendors caps were not linked it wouldn't be a issue
---
PSA: If you see it for sale for anything even remotely reasonable, it‚Äôd duped, so don‚Äôt buy it.
---
correct
---
The only other perk nerf that I‚Äôm aware of (and there could be some I‚Äôm not) is White Knight, which smells fishy to me in light of repair kits.  Still, it did happen months before that and was coupled with material cost reductions, so I‚Äôm not sure it really resulted in a net decrease in effectiveness beyond needing to repair a bit more often. Bethesda says they did it to put it in line with other durability perks, and it may be as simple as that. 
---
I know they also ‚Äúfixed‚Äù the over-repair bonuses that were applying to some items when repaired beyond 100%. I would‚Äôve preferred an across the board bonus for over repair, but eliminating it still made it equal across the board, so again, not really seeing it as a net negative. Here again, they say it was never intended and was just a fix, which does make sense considering that it didn‚Äôt apply to every item. 
---
I‚Äôd like them to take a look at weapon degradation‚Äîparticularly the lever action and laser weapons‚Äîas those are a mess, but they have been from the beginning, so I wouldn‚Äôt view that as a nerf, just a screwup.
---
So is every other hero, minus the "just a girl" heroes. Thank you, sir! I don't have a jetpack (don't really use power armor), and without marsupial... you just saved the day!
---
When you buy duped stuff do you just get banned?
---
That. Is. Awesome.
---
Nothing to add. Same for me lately.
---
Not a stealth nerf, it was in the patch notes
---
The tunnel is actually IN the station ;) Look at the floor as you walk in, towards the back and every-so-slightly to the right. It has a few planks covering it so we don't fall through, but still more than enough gap to see down there. 
---
But as InfraRedPS said (which you replied to), you have to "Interact" (E-key on PC) with Purveyor to complete it, despite there not *being* an "Interact" choice (IOW, Trading doesn't do it).
---
lol, sorry, Xbox. I'll add that.
---
Unyielding, maybe with Bolstering if you want a little more DR/ER.
---
Really, you want Sentinel or Cavalier effect (75% to avoid damage when standing still/sprinting).  Getting Unyielding or Bolstering versions of that is the god roll, but it's rare enough that you might have to settle for something else just to have the Sent/Cav effect.  I have Chameleon, Nocturnal and Hunter's pieces because of this.
---
In some way, it probably works out.  Can't complain about Chameleon.  I still hit for about 1.7K if I'm low health with two pieces of Unyielding.
---
No it will set up its own camp at your old spot.
---
Nah dude you tamed it it follows you its bot your camp location that tamed it.
---
Yup, same with melee.
---
No way it was the jester mask. If by some miracle you are talking about the harlequin mask being for 250caps, take that damn thing and run man.
---
My camp is right next to that house
---
The point my fellow posters are trying to get across is that the stats of the armor does not matter, only the legendary effects.
---
Most of your damage protection at low health is going to be coming from perks and effects, like nerd rage and serendipity. The value of your armor is mainly for the type of low damage high attack rate enemies, which you only need a marginal amount of armor value to reduce most of their damage, 30-50 armor will cut the damage of most of these enemy types in half, which is about as good as it gets before diminishing returns really kick in. Big enemies attack too slowly to really get through your ap and chance damage avoidance effects, especially when your action point pool is very high.
---
Better armor is better, but the quality of the base item is secondary to the effects the armor has.
---
I've never seen someone with it set up where you travel into a trap, the person who posted didn't say they had it set that way, only that someone else had a camp nearby that way.
---
I myself built around the player spawn so they are outside right next to the vending. If they go exploring they can trigger a button on the floor which will open a door and trigger 6 flamers, 6 tesla traps, etc. The door will close behind them.
---
They don't need to pick a lock, they just need to mind their own business, since there's nothing telling them to come in.
---
Am I griefing? No. I'm playing the game as intended. So was whatever player that had a trap base built *near someone else's vending*. If whatever curious player minded their own business, this would be a non issue.
---
Use the "Interact" key/button on whatever platform you've playing on. By default, this is "E" on PC, and apparently "X" button on PS4 (according to another reply here); sorry XBoners, I dunno what it is for you :(
---
Hope that helps.
---
If me saying yes stops you from buying it, then yes.
---
The LOTR geek in me wonders who this Legalos
---
&gt;but really? puppies and candy from a van? c'mon...children even know better.
---
Exactly, that is the point. You should know better than to randomly go into some random persons base even if they offer trades, puppies, or candy. That was literally my point, the only person to blame for getting killed in a death room is yourself for falling for it.
---
&gt;it doesn't matter if it's a game or RL ...it's people. I hope I choose to not a dick. that's fine if you want to play games like that but that's why Bethesda made the survival mode because that game mode is NOT what everyone wants to play (and it wasn't the game we were sold).
---
Uh, really? Do you forget the e3 press release about open world pvp anywhere in the game? That is literally what we were sold.
---
I do find it interesting before you said you'd only accept it if bethesda said they wanted to see more of that style of builds. Now that I brought up the fact they literally did when they complimented the first death room (that also said it was a trade hub on the front btw) as very cool and wanted to see more of them. You've gone mute on that part.
---
So now that bethesda did indeed say they wanted to see more of them are you going to admit you were wrong about them being griefing and not part of the game like you previously claimed you would if they said that?
---
I like that idea!
---
A lot of it was click bait. It's fun if you like fallout. Not really grindy compared to other games I've played. Has player vending now and really hasn't even been buggy as youtubers claimed since release. The duping thing is what almost ruined it. The updates have been free.
---
Hey there! I had a similar question a few days ago. Maybe you'll find this thread helpful: https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bp5762/what_should_my_daily_regimen_be/
---
I definitely want to get a backpack from the Order of the Tadpole, but man does it look like a lot of work.
---
In general, I find that I get distracted by scouting out little areas when I am working on a quest. Good for finding story stuff and looting, but inefficient from an XP sense (turning in quests is great for XP). So I try to stay focused (but, there is a good case to be made for stopping and smelling the roses every once in a while, too!). 
---
Good luck! Let us know what you learn!
---
Oops typo lol
---
Crypto currency (In game currency) is not giftable on xbox but you can buy them a gift card and then they can use that code to buy it
---
Lmao! Yes, this is completely accurate!

This person isn‚Äôt commenting from a place of knowledge. They‚Äôre just one of those weirdos that comments on a sub for a game they don‚Äôt even play just to be a negative voice.

Should note not sure if you can gift a digital gift card either.

Haha it‚Äôs all good and fun, made me chuckle
---
I'll take your +1 strength or agility ones  if you think they're useless. ‚ò∫

They need a cap sink. That would be fun but wouldn‚Äôt help get caps out of the economy.
---
I get you  ...that is not griefing not did I say it was. I was addressing being spawned into a trap.
---
2 patches ago Bethesda removed 60 dmg 60 energy and 60 rad resists from EVERY Power Armor set in the game. 
---
Basically it‚Äôs no longer adding the 60 dmg/60 energy/60 rad resist that the base Power Armor Frame added to your total. 
---
So everyone using Power Armor experiences the loss in stats. It‚Äôs not talked about a lot because most people are oblivious and Bethesda never mentioned it in the patch notes. 
---
Combine that with the fact that overrepairing Armor no longer adds DMG resistance and you have much weaker Power Armor currently as compared to the first 3 months of the game.
---
Indeed, it is now both a weapon of great power and a climbing tool.
---
You mean the thumb-tacks that are in some locations stuck in the pre-war map of Appalachia? 
---
If not, and it's part of the map we used for fast-travel, can you screenshot these colored pins you speak of? I'd seen that before on someone's screenshot, and tried to show my friend yesterday as I found it interesting, as it's not a thing on PC heh  
---
Thanks :P
---
No. We need a way to remove caps from the economy to balance out the duplication and people with Max caps on 8 accounts.
---
Im level 270 something and it has not been any slower than 50-51.
---
I dont remember where but they said the xp required to level up at lvl 50 is 10 000 and it stays that way. As many people complained about the scaling in FO4 and how it was easier just to reroll they wanted this game to be one were you could stick with you main and keep leveling up.
---
I'd want an insult bot to insult visiting travelers :)
---
Its value is around 250, but I'd do 200 if you want any sales with a vending machine.
---
I bought both short and long from Chad at Camden Park.
---
I just smacked a tree with mine because I accidentally had the artisan card on when I repaired it.
---
Camp fire tales event and the one by Dolly Sods where you collect the insect parts
---
Perfect grammar man better than 90 percent of Americans, and I'm American lol
---
Just punch a tree dude. That‚Äôs how I got the durability down.
---
Not sure why the downvotes.  It's entirely true.  That's why the golfer Ghouls for that one quest were so elusive.
---
Obviously it's about server stability.
---
sorry  I didn't address that.
---
putting a spawn point for an unavoidable trap is griefing IMO. i do believe the things Bethesda commented on wanting to see more of were built rooms functioning NOT as traps like that. I understand that. it's not my thing and with a heads up to go in, that's fair, like the dude with the maze is not really grieifng IMO.
---
Won't always give badges but seems to be the easiest way.
---
What about damage boosts on melee weapons? Was that in the notes as well? I've been holding onto my ripper hoping it would change back, but if it was in patch notes I'll just scrip it.
---
Shit. No, you're exactly right. That totally passed my mind. 
---
Even if they implement this, they need to tackle more important stuff first.
---
was it a stealth nerf? or maybe a bug introduced with that patch?
---
What about the burrows?
---
I had the flatwoods monster attack me at the berkley springs workshop other day, was jumping to unlock the combat bos helmet. The mothman, he pops up day and night. Jump around to camps in the woods and run around them. Last one killed was behind top of the world, in the woods.
---
Guess I gotta drink the 3 in my stash SINCE WE CANT USE THE PUNCH BOWL THEY GAVE US
---
Possibly after work I could post one but yes the map on the wall right behind the purveyor at least on PS4 has thumbtacks red and blue. Most are red at the other train station locations only 3 or 4 are blue and I don't know what they are for.
---
When the legendary vendor opened shop everyone lined up and waited their turn.
---
Did Uranium fever last night with 6 strangers that all went to low damage weapons and allowed everyone to tag the legendaries.
---
Fucked weird for online.
---
I've found pretty much all of the masks across multiple vendors. I probably spent 1000 caps altogether for all of them. They seem to go pretty cheap
---
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had over 6k caps. I must be doing something wrong.
---
This person probably knows that. I looked at their page and they have done this quest like 193 days ago and they were already past the part where you have to go to Whitesprings üôÑ
---
Where did this happen?
---
I got a 1* ghoul slayer and I was destroying things with it. I‚Äôd never used it before the badge either.
---
Just started the Possum badges the other day and noticed that all the musician ones I've done haven't registered either. Bummer. Hope they fix this one soon!
---
woosh
---
You can't complain about stealth boys if you use vats, that's why people use them, to counter people who don't aim.
---
I have only seen old man winter but he was for like 7500
---
I've never had over 2k lmao
---
Not just the camp, it's as if their game dev never speak with their shop owner. They nerfed shotguns before new responder skins can come out, PA are next to useless compared to legendary armors yet they put lots of work in its skins, yet almost no skins for popular legendary armors and weapons. Tons of useless eye candies for camp yet such little budget is allowed. The purveyor is an awesome addition to the game yet they immediately cap the amount of scrips so you don't need to play more than an hour to earn it. 
---
The financial of the game can be so much better if they have the right leadership. Whoever is making those decisions now is totally disconnected, I don't think he/she even plays this game himself.
---
Or release zetans...who knows?
---
For now - it's only for the boiler. 
---
I think it just looks the same because mainly it's that they used an existing switch rather than come up with a unique one only for a single event.
---
That is a good point.  Especially with the 90% weight reduction, it's difficult to argue against not keeping it with you.
---
^
---
What are the terminals even for? I only ever see two things regarding the scouts and that‚Äôs it.
---
Joining now
---
I'm not talking about the ones that have useful benefits. I'm saying they have ones that are so insignificant they may as well change what they are or how they effect the player
---
Ok I‚Äôm at the top of the world
---
I got 11, not sure if it means anything
---
I just took out a chopper. With a knife
---
Well here are a few tips I've found while experimenting. 
---
When setting up a "arrow ledge" do your best to fire each arrow dead centre of the previous one so the platform is straight
---
When making the next platform take a few steps back before firing the first bolt and try to gain a little altitude so it doesn't slope, making it harder to stand on.
---
You don't need to go more than 4 bolts per platform, three is a decent enough length to stand on without problems
---
You can shoot four as your base then stand on it and shoot your next bolt at head height and build straight up but it tends to only get you so high because you have to loose a bolt for each platform. E.g 4bolts, 3bolt, 2boltd etc.
---
If making platforms around a pole try the keep each platform at about 30-45 degrees from the previous platform making it easier to reach and I would suggest no higher than your characters jump.
---
And finally, if you find it hard to stand on one platform of arrows then build another one directly next to it increasing the size of the platform.
---
Yeah, I don't quite get the appeal either.  I guess if I threw 8 SPECIAL points into the Shotgun and Demolition Expert perks, I'd feel differently, but out-of-the-box, I was thoroughly underwhelmed by the one explosive Combat Shotgun I have.  And it broke constantly to boot.
---
Yeah, that was my second assumption. I haven't really taken part in too many nuke stuff, so I wasn't really sure what a good spot was for what I was looking for.
---
Im not sure.  My first day of rolls sucked.  3 star pistols.   Keep trying, you will get what you need.
---
I would love something like this.  As long as they don't put it in the atom shop only.
---
Shoot, they could possibly port over the arrow pack from the Creation Club for Skyrim.  That one I bought and are loads of fun.
---
Yea plays solo 99,9% of the time, dont have the patience to wait around for others ^^
---
I get by in hazmat suit, but my damage output takes a hell of a hit when not wearing my 5x Unyielding, and balancing around 20% health is extremely difficult without armor too ...
---
.. don't know why, but that sounds like a shop you'd find in Diagon Alley in Harry Potter :)
---
Yeah another one to watch out for is the Leatherworker one, it‚Äôs almost impossible to find death claw hides to scrap. If anyone knows a way to farm these things I‚Äôd appreciate knowing but it seems like everyone else is stuck too
---
Yes, and like the vending it should show what camp has what on the map. Like, this camps offering grilled radstad and corn soup! I'm there.
---
I have no affiliation to this guy but he has been planting nukes all over the place for a while.
---
Maybe watch some of his videos for inspiration?
---
https://youtu.be/6zXGhXQBWP4
---
Do what you just did and ask for help on reddit or a Facebook group or something of the sort. Another option is like you mentioned to go to Encryptid or even Scorched Earth as there is normally at least one or two people that need reviving depending on the people there.
---
Only Bethesda knows. I had assumed it was intentional so the game would be more challenging. It sucks either way. Power Armor needs major love.
---
Yes. It was all in the notes
---
Where is this house?
---
I have to get a crossbow for some future quest, i'm told. Will try it then.
---
What I would really like is for the event to always work.   To often I get to the event and cannot find the census bot at all.  I can only guess he is stuck under the map somewhere.    This has happened in a few of the spots the event can occur but Superior Sunset Farm is definitely the worst offender.
---
I got an Exterminator‚Äôs Gatling Plasma.  Worth anything?
---
I would also like a chatroom!  So you could text chat with others who are also at their terminals.  If they aren't going to give us server wide chat, at least this would be a decent way to coordinate adventures, find new friends, etc.
---
Thx very much for your answer ! :) You've confirmed my thoughts.
---
There's defend the fort quest at fort defiance that gets you 2 fusion cores. 
---
Also, a lot of player vendors are selling them now at good prices.
---
1. Uranium Fever - Three legendary spawns per event, so definitely worth it.
---
2. Free Range - Legendary sheepsquatch and probably lots of high value enemies like anglers.
---
3. Campfire tales - chance to get a possum badge.  *Allegedly.*
---
4. Workshop defense events are always worth some decent XP and plans if you're farming them.
---
I was trying to place a wall next to another one and the game didn't cooperate.
---
i got like 8 or 9 badges from doing this.
---
ive yet to do a possum challenge because they seem tedious
---
I'm a trader myself so I'm often carrying WAAAAAY to much to hold fusion cores in my inventory without pushing me over the limit and tbh I am starting to get a little bored of having power armour.
---
Of course.
---
Yesterday it wouldn‚Äôt let me attach a single section of roof  for absolutely no practical reason. So I stacked 6 rugs. Sure is great of Beth to give us all these opportunities to get creative with their bullshit building mechanics.
---
Seen one earlier in the nar repair yard.
---
Bethesda has already been good at telling stories.
---
Which no one here ever mentioned, they specifically said that a nearby base had a trap, and it sounds like someone went where they didn't belong. In other words, you've wasted a lot of time arguing about a situation that never applied to what you were talking about.
---
ah ok my mad must have missed it
---
This is one of the main reasons people put up with the bugs in Bethesda games ... They are amazing story tellers.
---
I already submitted a ticked about it, so maybe they fix it, and agree with you, PA needs some serious love, either in the form of legendary PA pieces or more perk cards to it.
---
I got Unyielding Raider armor leg, +1 Per
---
The campfire tales, bug collection and toxic cleanup can all give badges.   You'll know if you received a badge when the caps for completing the event/quest are paid out.  If you see a small badge icon appear while the caps are being paid out it means you have also received a badge.   You really need to look when this happens it happens quickly and is easy to miss.
---
I have read somewhere on this reddit that the chance of getting a badge is 25% when you complete one of the above activities.   I have no idea if this is true but it seems accurate to me.
---
Thats a stupid idea ,very very stupid
---
It looks ridiculous and Bethesda needs to get rid of it. Bunny hop 76 /sigh
---
Esimpson did you choose ranged weapon to get this?
---
Me too on xbox.
---
turrets used to be a waste, but with 5 or 6 super mutants spawning beside my camp whenever someone travels to my store, i am wishing for more turrets lol. i am making $$$ with all the gun  filled meat piles i find when i get home though :)
---
25-30k
---
Not really. I've got most items I need for my build and the chances of that particular camp having that God roll item for a price I can afford is super low. 
---
If I am doing something I won't really stop to check stuff out. But if I'm not going anywhere I will make time to check stuff out.
---
No sorry Ps4
---
Seems it should be auto instead of single shot
---
If you have the nukashine series, that one also appears.
---
nah, I clearly stated if it had been a trap lured in. I'm fine dude, no anger had. I was just trying to clarify. I can't read the op for clarification bc it's gone. oh well.
---
Riflegaming is awesome, he puts a lot of work into finding the good spots to nuke.
---
Yea just popping a stealthboy will ruin the other guys day super quick. 
---
Unless they have some kind of device that allows them to manually aim at stuff to shoot things. Something that is exactly like a computer mouse....
---
How long you been away
---
It's not an issue of anything being worth 25k, its an open world game. Some of us would like to play it as a vendor buying and selling all day. I can make 25k in 2-3 days just grinding for gear and aid stuff. Even faster now since I can do both at the same time with the player vendor. Everyone plays different and arbitrarily limiting the amount of money I can make is just silly.
---
Sure add me : o TCP Marbs o
---
Also UK so timings should work out
---
Lmao ew
---
I‚Äôd say so yes.
---
Be cool if he collect your resources you have at your base too!!!!
---
I can confirm campfire tales rewards a possum badge. I‚Äôve earned quite a few possum badges from Campfire Tales.
---
I have encountered an Albino Scorched in the mire north of Dyer Chemical.
---
I ran into a guy that had a theory he was testing that certain servers have a greater chance of dropping certain legendary states. Early testing was pointing him to yes. It would make it harder for you to get the specific states, since we can't select servers. That particular day 5 others had gotten explosive off the SBQ put of 9. Could have just been coincidence. Idk.
---
Pretty good. You could sell it for way more easily
---
Omg. I never even thought about painting the helmet.
---
 You did an amazing job!! Did you get one of the pip boys too? If so, do you plan on painting it to Match? 
---
And you also reminded me I need to get an airbrush for my leather working. I knew I was missing something in my workshop. Thanks!
---
Pretend to talk to her like other vendors and the quest completes.
---
Guess I just have to keep trying, did'nt want to waste the scrip if it was'nt even possible to get. But it is so im gonna keep feeding her my hard-earned scrip untill she grants my wishes :)
---
What have you done? What have you done?!
---
That‚Äôs what I thought. I‚Äôm currently running a bloodied swing speed super sledge 3 star that I found myself. So I‚Äôll try to sell that and make a quick buck.
---
animal friend
---
Don‚Äôt worry there lil guy Bethesda tends to the sheep you‚Äôll get your nerf in no time I bet
---
I assume this means this isn‚Äôt a new feature üòÇ
---
Thank you. I want a pet
---
Ultra F
---
This was added months ago
---
Awesome thanks!
---
A couple of other glitched challenges.   Deathclaw hides do not come from Deathclaws although people are reporting they can drop from Gulpers.   Playing the musical instruments at Watoga High School does not work either.  I am not sure if that applies to the other locations as I stopped trying after realizing Watoga did not work.    Pictures of generators is also a bit dicey.    Sometimes they work and sometimes they do not.  I was told the fusion generator at Camden Park always worked and it did not for me but was able to take a picture of a small generator at a workshop that did work, so ymmv.   The stimpack diffuser also does not currently exist.    I cannot think of any others off the top of my head at the moment.
---
Same. I think it's bugged
---
appreciate your help!
---
Last night i was quickly selling all my weapons to vendor so i can go to the nuke site , without realizing, sold my AAE lever action and my all rise.  Good thing is i went back for it after not seeing it on my inventory. I wish bethesda would add like a buy back feature that doesn't charge you for the full item price. So if you sold it for 50 caps to buy back for 50 caps incase more people like us sell their weapons without knowing.
---
I was recently fantasizing about how nice it'd be to have a Plasma Shotgun that was actually a shotgun, so probably. üòó
---
If we dont get no toll, then we dont get no sweet roll...
---
Well that's good to hear.  Guess I'll keep at it.
---
I tried a Bloodied Handmade just to see what the fuss was about.  Now I'm hooked.  Next, I picked up a piece of Unyielding from a vender for cheap....it wasn't a game changer.  But then I picked up a second, and then a third piece.  The more you have the greater result in sneak ability and available vats, carry weight, etc...
---
I would buy it just because I known I could sell it for more.
---
But the weapon itself isn't that impressive to me as I don't have a use for it for my build.
---
They‚Äôre not supposed to be in the game so your condescending remark is a bit out of place. I hope they find a way to remove them completely.
---
They're no different than any other Bloodied Explosive weapon.
---
How much more?
---
From the nuka cola factory, cross the bridge heading towards the fairground and its on the right hand side just after the bridge.
---
Did u try logging out and back in?
---
In addition to, the bug parts collecting quest and clean up sewage also rewards possum badges.
---
Worst. Nightmare.
---
20 hours after you use it is what I'm told. 
---
I know it's not at daily reset for sure.
---
Freddy fails to spawn so I have no choices left.  If I leave the server I am on the quest resets
---
I like doing the enclave events to defend the robots whenever I'm near one since it's a simple "kill waves of enemies" thing. Idk if it's always supposed to be super mutants but so far that's the case, so even without the event rewards it's worth it for me cause of the materials.
---
I would love to hack her and turn her into an evil minion ala Curie.
---
People that complain about the meta should just play a different game cause they‚Äôre just bad?? 
---
Keep hoping all ya want lol in all reality they don‚Äôt care about what you want they care about what will maintain the amount of players they have to keep micro transactions going.
---
No worries, I'll add you when I'm on.
---
Yo unlock parts at random by scrapping a bunch of that weapon type. Otherwise you can check shop vendors and hope they sell it.
---
Ran into these, and many other scorched variants, rather regularly.   Just ran into a scorched mothman in the far northern part of the Mire just today.
---
I would agree with you on the basis that we saw a similar thing with a much more successful title, Doom 2016.  It got about a year of robust support, and then someone abruptly pulled the plug and it's like it didn't exist anymore.  It was rather disappointing, actually, because SnapMap was a fun diversion that got some solid enhancements, but was left in a really funky state in the end.  No game should take in excess of 2 minutes to load off an SSD.  Seriously.
---
There's a lot to do in 76, but the fact of the matter is that its world is only so large and it's likely not going to undergo some radical metamorphosis, or magically double in size.
---
What I think will happen with 76 is that, following the Wastelanders update, the game will have a kind of relaunch.  It will be a "complete" game at that point - the game we probably should have had last November - and they'll leave it at that.  Yes, they talk about how they'll support it for "years to come," but I assume they are talking about servers, not content.
---
Welcome back!
---
If poison actually did damage. Like bleed damage, doesn't do anything. Instead of a static number it should be a percentage of health lost like 5%
---
I seem to run into Mothman pretty frequently at whitespring around the snake icon. Not everyday but often enough that i noticed it, there was one there yesterday that i killed.
---
I just took one from the shrine place in the north and waited 2 weeks and repaired all three of them
---
Defiance does not let you defy its boundary, unfortunately :( 
---
Up until last week (despite being lvl 130) I wasn't a Mutation user, so I didn't have marsupial. Granted, I still carry both of my PA sets (Exvacator for carry capacity and T-60 for DR and Jetpack), and would use the PA to climb on top of for an extra bit of jump height to get to places.
---
Defiance was one place I tried, after scaling Watoga Municipal from the outside.  
---
Bethesda, at some point somewhat-recently, added in a preventative measure --for fly-hacks I presume-- which if you're "floating" it'll teleport you back to the last place you were standing. In addition to that, Defiance has a invisible barrier on top that you can walk on, in turn, triggering said preventative measure. :(
---
Every time I got on top, it'd TP me back to the side building's roof I would jump from.  
---
Granted, I didn't try any other places to get up there, so maybe just that side of Defiance's roof has the barrier, but I get the impression it'll probably be over the entire thing. 
---
Sorry :\\ I, too, love to climb (obviously), so I also was bummed! I still say give it a shot. I tried from the small side-building to the South, may have better luck elsewhere?
---
Manly men in tights.
---
it's in my vending machine, 1990caps
---
IGN: ictop94 (PC)
---
I just got one from one of those nice ghoul chaps from the houses with scanners on at whitesprings that you cannot enter...mine was a 2 ‚≠êÔ∏èvampires super sledge with swing speed....Sexy eh?
---
I feel like this would be a damn near perfect Responders faction item if they ever introduce proper faction mechanics.
---
My knife wielding one time shotgunner seems to get nothing but crap roll heavy weapons that I can‚Äôt script till tomorrow.  Figured I‚Äôd try to find her a decent backup gun for ranges but that hasn‚Äôt worked out yet.  Might have to try my luck with 2 stars.
---
I wish I was. I keep on getting trapper or combat armor. My real goal is unyielding combat armor. So far im 2 peices short.
---
There's a living friendly dog above the train tunnel Southeast of Harper's Ferry, if I'm remembering right. He's always there with a skeleton or two. Good place to build a camp
---
The last 4 times i fought the SBQ i got absolutely nothing.  What gives?
---
This looks better than the one bethesda is pre selling.
---
I doubt it, but if they decide to remove duped items you're screwed out of what you pay for it.
---
I‚Äôm down on ps4, though you didn‚Äôt list what platform you use :)
---
Alright, yea, I know of those ones, no screenshot needed then :) 
---
Was hoping you had these in the map-menu, like I had seen. They seemed to have been colored rings around certain map markers (and I don't believe they were edited in, but may have been)
---
Thanks anyways! :P
---
i'm at work right now, but i was planning on running it tomorrow, 9am, mountain time? any interest in joining me?
---
If you are trying to weather it get some sand paper and just use that in the areas you want weathered. Should work pretty easily.
---
I hit 9k caps before player vendors.
---
After it released I've probably spent over 200k caps buying all the plans I can find. And I'm up to buying excavator mod plans and they are not cheap.
---
I had 5 masks for sale and sold them all for like 50 a piece  never used them and they went quick
---
I cant tomorrow sorry mate
---
&gt;"ha ha just play a different game" 
---
Players go elsewhere 
---
&gt;"gee I sure wish more people played this game"
---
There is also the collect the contaminated stuff up north of the map. Does that give them?
---
AAE seems to be a solid choice imo
---
What‚Äôs the third effect?
---
Most of the time buybacks are still way cheaper than they would cost on the real market, so consider the somewhat inflated cost a not-paying-attention penalty ;)
---
How do you get so many???
---
no worries, my man! let me know next time, k? good luck!
---
Yeah you are right :P but a better feature wouldn't be bad
---
I'd say it is.  I have one of these, except it's 2\* and Lv. 40, and for a while it was a pretty decent thing for going after the SBQ.  But I've since switched away from two-handed.
---
Darn you must have a pretty high opinion of yourself to be able to confidently speculate what would happen in a completely hypothetical scenario lol
---
So to get the tourist, I had received a lot of misinformation on locations. He/She stands out with a brighter colored shirt. I believe there are 10 specified locations. I think your best bet is going to be the battlefield cemetery or Colonel Kelly‚Äôs Monument since they are somewhat out-of-the-way. I‚Äôve heard the parking lot at wavy Willards. I spent a ton of time down in the southern forest areas never succeeding.
---
Last time I saw that guy was about a month after release of the game....
---
The robots that defend RobCo and the Nuka-Cola plants also have variants, cuz you can see the tread-sporting tesla gun protectrons there too. 
---
There's a robotics station model in the game and you sort of interact with it when you're trying to find the origins of the Fake Sheepsquatch.
---
The memorial area is the only place I don't loot.
---
No there‚Äôs something definitely wrong with the bloody explosive laser with beam splitter mod. It ignores armor or does way more damage than what‚Äôs listed on the gun. My bloody explosive handmade can‚Äôt 2 shot people with splash damage
---
Speaking of the snake icon what are they I see like bee ones and I go there and there nothing is that like a hotspot for snakes or bees
---
XP gained is affected by intelligence
---
Pump. Great capacity, versatility, etc.
---
It hasn‚Äôt stopped anyone so far. :p But while I find it mildly baffling that so many people seem unable or uninterested in using the search feature, I do think it‚Äôs a good sign that there are many new and returning players :)
---
Make sure that stuff is favorited
---
So cheating is considered viable meta? Did you buy a duped E laser or were you duping them yourself?
---
[](/awelestia)I was looking at a lot of footage, but it was really hard to tell with the naked eye even at quarter speed, so I devised a simple test. I found footage of someone using a furious minigun on a mirelurk queen, and took a few pictures of the health bar. [This is a picture of the queen's health after 15 shots, then 30 shots, then 45 shots, and then the health bar at 60 shots.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/249279013510578186/579356643842719764/Furious_test_15_30_45_60.png), and [this is just the affected health](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/249279013510578186/579356645273108491/Furious_test_15_30_45_60_affected.png) for easy comparison.  
---
You would expect the 60 shots to far exceed the 30 shots since the damage is still ramping up right? But it almost looks like it doesn't add any meaningful damage at all from my test.
---
Every time dupers mass dupe something, Bethesda had no choice but nerf them. Dupers really killed all the Legendaries.
---
Nice üòÇ
---
Not exactly prefab, but there is a Hella cool cave you can live in near valt 76.
---
There should be a mod on the nexus that's a bit easier to use
---
Never duped anything and if Bethesda fucked up and it‚Äôs just in the game it‚Äôs not cheating at all lol.
---
Aw I gotcha. I was thinking of the cap for pricing items. My bad, Imisunderstood that. Caps carried cap is lame. See I have never reached the cap because I keep buying and selling. See I spend my time go to all these garage sales and resell them for a bit more. So my flow is always at or around 10k
---
I almost never have this issue.  PC eastern US.
---
I sell 3 star legendaries for 500 but no one still buys. 2 stars cost 200 and one stars only 50.
---
I sell Camp plans/recipes at 10 caps, mod plans at 15, weapons and armor plans at 25-100 depending on what it is
---
Almost like a vendor lemon law
---
So a sword?
---
Apologies friend. I hadn't noticed this was a reply, I choose to blame mobile formatting if only to shield my damaged ego :p
---
Youre a mighty big dumb ass arent you
---
if you happen to be on ps4 feel free to visit my camp sometime im always happy to equip low levels and help them out the only thing i might charge you would be some steel/plastic or such 
---
and for your question: as the other commenter said you unlock mods (exept for some special mods on higher weapons) by scrapping more of the weapon you wanna use 
---
if you want a suppressor und your pipe revolver for example just take every pipe revolver with you that you can find and scrap them at the next workbench every scrapped revolver will grant a chance of unlocking a new mod for it (doesnt matter wich level or what mods are attatchef to the weapon you scrap)
---
Events.
---
Don‚Äôt even know what you could be referring to.
---
Terrible deal...for the vendor.
---
For bloodied melee, definitely unyielding (also use radicool)
---
For ranged, bolstering is better if you use automatic weapons. Sneak snipers or just vats crit builds get more benefit from unyielding since it boosts A and L
---
Yeh see I wanna role play as the wasteland Rockefeller. Jumping server to server peddling my goods and stacking cash for no particular reason lol.
---
In your opinion, should I get in touch with Bethesda Support?
---
Only stuff found in the world yourself will count. It sucks but you can't buy them for the challenge.
---
Even with the perk to find them I'm not even half way done over a weeks worth of playtime.
---
Exploits are cheating
---
Can give 8.5k for this golden girl
---
Hmm this sounds like a trap to me...
---
20hrs from the first thing you sold on reset. So if I sold something at 0000 and again at 1959 it will reset at 2000. From my experience
---
but please nerf them only in a pvp aspect i have gotten hands on a furious explosive ultracite laser in early december and its the only viable laser rifle i ever had (only play pve) it would be a shame seeing this beauty go down for its usefullness in pvp
---
I have same problem but no mic. Usually only play on Weekends and Thursday.
---
Absolutely the best location for legendary farming. More than half of my good stuff came from WS. But do a scout run first before investing time to do the nuke, because nuke can‚Äôt turn non legendary into legendary ghouls. All nuke does is turning level 42 ghouls into max level so the drop will be max level. If you see a bunch of legendary ghouls before the nuke, go for it.
---
They were organically dropping at one point. How is that an exploit if ur just playing the game, you want me to get rid of it? Lmao
---
Are you on PC?   I can‚Äôt speak to console experience.
---
I've seen it a hundred times friendo. Elitists drive off a fanbase then cries when the servers shut down or nobody plays.
---
Bayonet with grenade
---
I farm for legendarys a fair bit to try find god roll weapons and armor.
---
The crap stuff gets sold at there default price and good items get sold for whatever I think they are worth.
---
I know I've got one stalker who shows up multiple times a day even using there alt characters and buys en  mass. I've had a few chats with them and they seem nice.
---
Where?
---
Duping you dence boy
---
You could have just replied with a simple ‚Äúyes‚Äù
---
Not really. They nerfed TSE cause you could 1-2 shot anyone no matter the armor. And if you‚Äôve ever played with a BE laser you can see something is clearly wrong with it. No gun should be able to 1-2 shot just with splash damage
---
Ignore the other response I just deleted.  Duh, reread the post.  Yeah, I would.  Sounds like latency though.
---
How do you activate these?  I have been trying for a few days.  Haven't seen one active either.
---
Really just the savage divide in general. I know thats not much help but pretty much every encounter ive had was there. I definitely seen him just east of the ammo factory a few times
---
I‚Äôm not talking about duping ur just trying to push ur own rhetoric into my mouth lolol
---
Www.facebook.com/The.EATT
---
What about those who played genuinely?
---
Watching his tube when ever he gets a new one up
---
Oh thx! I actually am on PS4 so maybe later I could join you and get a suppressor for some steel
---
I got a prime reciever for a crossbow yesterday. Not sure if ive actually seen it before and i get dozens of primes off the SBQ
---
Think it like weapon splits one bullet into a small and a big bullet fragment. Big fragment deals %100 damage and small fragment deals %20 damage
---
Yesterday I took a day off of the game and logged on today and had the same issue.
---
It is literally impossible to aim with the crossbow sight. Even an option to remove it would be good.
---
If I'm in the room above big looting stuff he still talks and I don't think I should be able to hear him through the floor in the room below. I don't even think he should talk until I go down there.
---
Also melee at the moment. Not sure how they managed to screw that up so bad. But I think that's just bugs with the update.
---
If your trying to take a pic of a swarm of bees for the challenge there's a dilapidated shack in the fields of aaronholt homestead that has bee hives, and if you take the honey swarms will attack you.
---
Sell them something
---
Not your fault, I added that info after your first comment ;)
---
I'll get in touch with Bethesda and see what they have to say.
---
I just wanted to ask here first to know if someone else is having the same issue
---
They stopped dropping because they said it‚Äôs broken right now and people have really caught onto that. The BE laser with beam splitter is massively overpowered right now
---
.. I can't... They have no caps..
---
I hope your just a really good shitposter no one uses lmao and lolol that much
---
It‚Äôs a super rare item that you probably will never run into a player with one if there‚Äôs no duping. Same with sentinel assassin armors and most other items. Dupers ruined the whole concept of rare legendary.
---
It's most likely a visual bug. Sell something.
---
The fact that no one has it is pretty solid evidence that no one ever got it.  No one even who ever associates with other players, anyway.  It would've been duped to high Hell by now.
---
The turrets take up so much! I have my entire base surrounded by defensive walls with no turrets, and I have enough budget to build a a three story dwelling with full decorations and lights, plus two other smaller buildings and a farm.
---
Hard to say, just message me if on. My reddit name is the same as PSN. Off and on all night.
---
Scrap a bunch of that weapon and you should unlock the mod eventually.
---
Scorchbeast's cropduster attack can turn a deathclaw into scorched deathclaw, so yeah
---
.. I did.. the game didn't let me and told me they didn't have any caps...
---
I really want this as I'm trying to roleply a crazed doctor who, after emerging from the vault, went kinda insane and started doing drugs and experimenting with mutations. I have a doctor's office as a base and sell stimpak and chems. Trying to buy the mutation recepies so I can sell those as well. Also trying to build enough charisma to be a good team medic.
---
Well I can play any time before 5:30
---
Yet here I am. The unbothered act u got goin on here isn‚Äôt fooling anyone lolol lmao lolol
---
Damn, a whole computer mouse, whatever will I do with my pet computer rat. I can't possibly compete with pro hax like that.
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug dude , well hopefully , it happens to me too it said 0 but I sold something n it went to like 1390
---
Nah.
---
Huh. Then I have no idea.
---
Call your duper buddy they have several mules carrying them. No it‚Äôs not rare and makes you look like a duper when you wear it.
---
well if you only need a supressor i wouldnt dare charge you anything no worries but i can only play tomorrow
---
add me anyways flavourite_hopfi and if we find a time to get together ill make you a decent stealth gunslinger even have some cool legendarys i guess
---
feel free to check my reddit account to get some idea of what you want üëçüèº
---
I tried selling and it wouldn't let me
---
Nice, thats what i like to hear, thanks!
---
That's been a glitch since beta.
---
&gt;Never duped anything and if Bethesda fucked up and it‚Äôs just in the game it‚Äôs not cheating at all lol.
---
Also heres your own words saying duping isnt cheating
---
I love how they have kept this item in the games.  The sweatroll woodelf from Oblivion stillakes me giggle.
---
All my best weapons are two stars all my best armors are 3 stars.
---
They took the explosive energy guns out of the loot pool for a reason. They admitted they‚Äôre broken right now and its definitely evident if you‚Äôve ever played with a BE laser with beam splitter
---
I haven't even launched a nuke yet.
---
WS drops plenty of legendary ones even if it‚Äôs not nuked... nothing great but easy farm to get scrip...
---
As long as its fun and the expansions are free then im in, thanks man!
---
Yea, right now my camp won't let me place a wall because it's "outside the build area". Oh yeah? There's a floor below it, there's a roof above it. There's walls on either side. How is that one wall out of bounds?
---
Toss me a caps offer (I'm not looking for a crazy high price on it), I did see your post with the gear you have, I collect weapons weight reduction armor and saw you have 2 pieces, I'm also a rifleman, but didn't see any ranged that I don't already have, would be interested if you had any others not listed.  I'm west coast US, at work today for about 6 more hours but off the next 2 days if you want to meet up.  I like the "Mad Scientist" type project you are working on and would love you help you achieve what you are looking to do. Haha
---
I meant if they‚Äôre dropping organically it‚Äôs not cheating .... I  very explicitly stated I‚Äôve never duped anything so idk what ur angle is here buddddddd
---
They usually become active after 8:00 pm at camp Adam (I believe is the camp name). It‚Äôs located west-ish of the giant teapot, east of the map.
---
That sounds like fun! I‚Äôm gonna check the prices, or ill wait for a sale, thanks!!
---
Damn vault dwellers. Appalachia was just fine before you came along
---
(Haven't seen the intro in a while, might have said it wrong)
---
Is it a Glitch or an Easter Egg?
---
When a camp owner has nothing great but regular everyday items you can find anywhere, why fund them?
---
There's holes in the walls in the white springs bunker that you can jump through into the fallout nether. Big holes. Kinda fun to fall through the world repeatedly
---
I saw the body once on the table next to that giant tea kettle.
---
Depends on the 3rd star. If it's got Strength you could probably get 10k for it. If not probably around 6-8k.
---
I mean, if you're going to fast travel anywhere, why not? You're taking a gamble anyway.
---
Same here, waiting for a popular world event and waited for people to die, the swimming challenege will be a bit more difficult to do without asking first.
---
This will get no where
---
all of the above, and a recon scope!
---
Exactly lol go baa somewhere else
---
It is a legacy weapon right?
---
They've stated laser rifles shouldn't have had the explosive effect in the first place.
---
Personally I think the explosive should be replaced on those weapons.
---
It's one of my favorite events, for that exact reason :)
---
Yeah you get some crazy deals. My prices seem high to random players but they're actually on the lower side. http://imgur.com/gallery/yNZfPVQ Just a few of the things in Flooptown's armory if anyone on PS4 wants to check us out
---
If you can play ESO, I‚Äôm surprised fo76 doesn‚Äôt do ok.  Both are network sensitive with less than stellar network interface coding.
---
I can say that I upped my Internet recently, and it required a new ‚Äúmodem‚Äù.  I have my own router/wap and started having server disconnects repeatedly.  I moved my Ethernet cable from my router over to theirs after realizing that I was essentially double hopping through two NATs, and the game doesn‚Äôt like that.  Now that I am on their router (it‚Äôs still internal, theirs also does the normal route 10.x.x.x Internet to 192.168.x.x internal, so not directly on the Internet, that‚Äôs a no-no) it‚Äôs running smoothly again.  I‚Äôll eventually bridge the two internal connections and move my gaming system back over to my router, cause I don‚Äôt trust them to maintain theirs, lol.
---
The original death room said "trader or medical" or something like that over it as a lure to get people to enter, they fully supported tricking people into it.
---
Tbh, glitches and bugs don‚Äôt bother me at all, unless its something that doesn‚Äôt allow me to progress at all. Thanks!
---
I couldn't get rid of mine either...  Worked around it and made a base I kinda dig.
---
World, quests, characters, monsters, mysteries, everything actually. Ill check the edit you‚Äôve posted, thanks man!
---
*started dropping rather. Sincerely hate that you can‚Äôt edit titles.
---
System?
---
dont remember exactly what lines, but some holo/computer stuff around in enclave bunker. a military dude called ragnarsdottir or similar, which is weird since that means daughter of ragnar. also some other stuff with gender written vs voiced. doesnt matter at all for playability, just weird
---
Was smart to delete that comment I would‚Äôve reported it
---
Ok cool thx! Can you respond to this comment tommorow when you can play so I know when to get on?
---
I didnt delete it
---
I finally got it the other. Really easy spot near the pipes on the back of the Grafton dam building.
---
I noticed this last night as well.
---
sure im gonna tell you as soon as i know
---
Still need more cap sinks
---
that's dicey ... I'm not a fan of trickery and that's trickery. I think that sorta thing is much better suited for survival but alas it's an in game mechanic. to me though that is griefing. it's tricking. the maze one I saw was not necessarily a trick. it was a maze and scared people I'm sure but the deathclaw couldn't kill them at least. for me that's a bit gray altho it isn't really nice to scare people either. not saying everything is all sunshine and happy rainbows in life though.
---
LOL. I have found quite a few, that's your first I take it. ;)
---
Got the remember this for the next climb-seneca-rock-challenge!
---
I'm hoping Bethesda will one day create a 'Item Restoration' feature similar to World of Warcraft's.
---
You basically can restore an item you accidentally destroyed and you're only allowed to do this once a month.
---
Hearing it alot.  I only saw it when I moved my machine.  But it sounds pretty common last couple days.
---
Well done! üòÅüëç
---
You put it much better than I did, nicely done.
---
If you get lucky at the Encriptid event and someone takes a knee in the pond, you can even get the swimming one done there.
---
I typically haul between 600 and 800 lbs. I can move more quickly without power armor than with.
---
Anytime gl in the wastes
---
No. People use them so that they can 1 hit anyone with sneak damage even if you are looking right at them.
---
Shoot them at low level events? Saves real ammo,  gets you tagged in for most kills
---
Remember the game was promoted as a survival game, it is why food and drinks are in the game. Just because bethesda decided to back down on the pvp after a lot of players complained is the only reason they did that. If the game wouldn't have bombed as badly as it did I doubt they even would have changed how the slap damage or camp damage works.
---
The fact is, that the removal of camp damage is what makes the death rooms viable now. So if anything you should be blaming those who wanted camp damage turned off.
---
Event map icon is often bugged. Use join function right on it, and if you can't teleport, there is no event
---
&gt; If you can play ESO, I‚Äôm surprised fo76 doesn‚Äôt do ok 
---
ESO has been out for years and they managed to get better servers and stability. Fallout 76 still has a lot of homework to do to get better.
---
About the router, I just have the one my ISP provided me (in which I made some tweaks like port forwarding) and I don't think it's its fault, otherwise I would have latency issues in the other games as well.
---
BTW, I just submitted a ticket to Bethesda and now let's see what they say. If we come up with a solution, I'll be posting it here so if in the future someone has the same problem, he will at least have a lead.
---
Doesn't seem to be server hopping for me, I would server hop with no issues, its until I haven't played the game for 10+ hours and I come back to my vending machines reset
---
Scorched was nice and lazy. If they hadn't been looking for you, I could've stolen that vertibird and been halfway to the Commonwealth. You there. You and me - we shouldn't be here. It's these vault dwellers the Scorched want.
---
Yay, good to hear! If you ever want help finding a group, you should check us out over at r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Very active discord, and we‚Äôre all nice folks
---
This is what I did when low level.  Kid picking a fight, then running to mommy and daddy for protection, lol üòù worked for me!
---
‚ÄúThe Whitespring is under OUR protection‚Äù.  I never tire of hearing the assaultron say that. üòâ
---
It is a PC issue, happens nearly every 5 minutes. and the camera doesn't help find the body, because it just disappears as soon as it hits the ground before you can even loot it. It is a very well known bug so no point in continuing to report it when it is well known.
---
Xbox? I would buy it for a decent amount.
---
Forgive me if I'm mistaken but I thought you can FT to friend's camps go free even if you're not in a team. 
---
I say that because I've been visiting a lot of the vendors that post here. To do so I have to friend them of course. Yet when I travel to them it still costs caps. 
---
I've played with friends before and I remember being able to FT to their camp for free even before joining as a team.
---
I may be mistaken, but remember them writing that explosions didn't make sense with energy beams. I have no idea if theyre broken or not though, only explosive weapon I've gotten was a revolver
---
From what I‚Äôve noticed, rarely do people buy items in game that are above 1k in price. Even if they‚Äôre 3* weapons and armour with useful perks. And then you have the trade subs where unless you have a god roll good luck finding a buyer.
---
i feel with you im in search of it for a long time now!
---
Agreed on both points.  Good luck!
---
Have you been hearing a lot of it on this subreddit?
---
I searched through this subreddit and google, it doesn't seem to be a common bug
---
Yeah. I have tried it with Marsupial, but I have nerve damage in my hands and am not great at jumping.  My hope was that someone with a jet pack had tried and been successful. 
---
Just looking at the artillery up there, it seemed like there ought to be *something* up there, if only a couple of BOS corpses.
---
Scorchbeasts and queen counts as scorched, so you can use zealot, prime recievers or scorched killer reciever to kill them
---
one of those little compasses in the handle...
---
I play every day, can confirm game is getting more and more broken again. It was getting stable around patch 6 but the last handful of patches have destroyed what server stability they had worked on previously.
---
How is the ‚Äúprofit‚Äù better in adventure?
---
With my bloodied crossbow I one hit almost everything
---
Thank you :)
---
Interesting. Did you need a plan for that or is that a random drop?
---
I play every day and can confirm what he said. Hell I even make mods for this game. So I probably know more about the back end of the game than most people.
---
This game is a broken mess again. Server stability got better around patch 6 but the last few patches have killed all the stability they previously had and the servers are crashing as often as they did back in patch 3.
---
Nice.
---
I agree with a lot of this. And re: killing Free Range brahmin, I just think it‚Äôs mean :(
---
The Fixer replaced my main sniper‚Äôs combat rifle until I got a nice AA one from the Purveyor this week, so yes it is definitely that good.
---
And hey, if you ever want a group for fighting the Queen, check us out at r/fo76filthycasuals, you can almost always scramble up a group, at least on PC.
---
None of my friends helped  so I asked randoms in the wasteland and offered caps. After days of waitin some 8yo lvl 34  tagged along til we got it done. I was so desperate to complete the tadpole garbage so I paid the kid 5000 caps for helpin me finish
---
I'm not saying you're wrong but the pvp was advertised as agreed on and opt in - you engage in pvp and if not you become wanted if you "break the law" and when people could have friends clear wanted tags it meant there was no consequence to murder.
---
I get pvp and survival. but to me being a survival game doesn't have to have pvp in it. I have played pvp games and even pvp in this game but I don't find it fun to kill people period but especially hunt people down that don't want to fight at all and murder them.
---
those that want that can play that and those that don't, don't have to with the change to add survival.
---
Do you have to turn in more than 1 to have a chance or is that just a rumor?
---
I thought that challenge was kill it with a syringer? I remember having to bash a Yao Guai in the face with a syringer to kill it for one of the tadpole hunter requirements (softened it up with a shotgun 1st)
---
Ouuuch... That must hurt...
---
Haven‚Äôt had it drop yet, if it does I bet a good place to look might actually be the Idle Explosives daily. It‚Äôd make sense anyway, and I still need to get more data on it.
---
Yeah, sometimes I put that era's music on at my work. My coworkers are like "wtf is this ew" and I'm all "BIG IROOON", lol.
---
No. Harpers ferry is better because of two levels, a lit of flux and you don't have to use pa underground
---
True, the Purveyor does make UF far more attractive than it was a few weeks ago.
---
A random drop
---
Yes frame mod that does bleeding or armor piercing
---
I always turned in one by one. So when I find multiple ones in the Enclave bunker, I leave hand one in and come back for the next ones. I doubt there is any benefit in turning in multiple ones.
---
lol, dang... also I tried it with the ‚Äúyou see throwing arcs‚Äù perk for the first time like a week ago and it blew my mind how much easier it was. I‚Äôd basically had it down to muscle memory already, but dang.
---
You need to kill bears with a few different weapons for the badge, including an automatic weapon and a syringer.
---
That is a demi-god roll.  He can surely sell it on the trade subReddits
---
Also good life advice there :)
---
Stay strong, bother. Only the most resilient ones among us will be promoted to the rank paladin and beyond.
---
yeah, but I think they can eventually figure out how to increase them like they have gradually done with our stash limits. awhile back somebody had a good idea of deleting all the useless objects from the world to save space, their suggestion was burnt books which are all over the place and literally have no use at all (can't even be scrapped) so how much space would potentially be freed up by zapping them from existence?
---
Well if hat challenge is timed......this won't be the fastest route unless someone refines the process of building arrow platforms
---
Really wished they would add a set of weapon perks for cross bow, black powder and Bowie where it buffs all
---
Yep, I wrote the bit criticizing UF before the Purveyor launched, now it‚Äôs definitely more valuable.
---
Also I had to look at your post like twice before I stopped thinking ‚Äúwhat on earth is a three-letter swear word‚Äù
---
They released a Bowie skin you can get from clean up quest
---
Yeah I do love it for the increased carry weight but sometimes it just gets in the way.
---
If only it weren't always dead.
---
99% of my caps goes to fast traveling and during my 300h I have never had over 2000 caps.
---
Have you tried turning the game off, and then back on? I know it sounds cliche, but often that works.
---
Im close to 500 and barely can get 1 lvl in session. It was about 3 per day in old times
---
Happening today as well,  was buddy b earlier and fine.  Now 3 in a row crash
---
How about 2500?
---
Vertibot farm or just played a lot?
---
Different bolt types would be great. Include the mentioned broadhead, blunt, and poison but also add fire, irradiated, shatter/spread shot, and whatever else seems appropriate.
---
Maybe try to trick it? Store a wall, place it agajn and retry? Or start from a different wall and snap the roof to another roof. Etc
---
I found one at the Sparse Sundew Grove on first try
---
Rofl sorry friend i pierced your heart with that arrow and you have about 5 seconds to live but.....your HP is full.
---
I do like the idea to add some range to stims so you don't have to be right next to the person though.
---
 LOL you must have confused me with someone who takes you seriously  
---
already showed you don't care about the game ("I hope it does die") so my time here is done
---
#
---
Got a map spot for us?
---
Taxes? In game where everybody BUT player died? WHERE THOSE TAXES ARE GOING THEN?!
---
are you logging out correctly or just closing the game
---
They did definitely change the xp payout for glowing enemies, esp glowing ones.
---
I'm curious how nuclear winter and the wastelanders update will change the game. I suspect it will be much bigger and game changing than wild Appalachia  atleast I hope so..
---
Where can I find the recipe for legendary goulash?? :D
---
I always quit through the menu; 'Quit to Desktop'
---
Yeah I got on after this last patch and it is 16/16 now and doesn't increase with 200% condition... I was sad
---
It's part of an event, something about fighting scorched
---
They don't drop flux stabilizing stuff though
---
Nice trick! Wish I could sell ammo for 1.1 caps though, it‚Äôs a mess right now
---
Only reason challenges are hard is their bugs. Almost all categories has few that doesn't register such as plant crops, visit locations, kill enemies with nukes... Oh the actually hard one is being conduct 60 times. I haven't get that event even once during my last 40 hours played. Not to mention 60 times....
---
Oh yes, didn't collect flux ingredients since beta
---
It really depends on the popularity and financial earnings of the game. If the game declines drastically both financially and in popularity, then most likely Bethesda will stop supporting it. However, the game just came out, and it still has a healthy player base. In financial terms, only Bethesda knows how well the game is performing. I would say it‚Äôs highly probable that Bethesda will continue to support the game for the next couple of years.
---
Only time I notice this happening to me is if I move or remove and replace my machine.
---
Or if I get the message that my camp won't be in this world than I have to change worlds for my camp to respawn.
---
It only ramps up for 30 shots and your test is very poor considering that, especially on mirelurk queen, tagging different body parts deals substantially different damage. Even using vats it's not really that accurate. For instance, say you're aiming for the head but she's moving so your bullet might hit her mandible instead. This sort of thing happens all the time. Testing damage via enemy hp bars is a shit way of measuring, if you want to do a good job of it to get conclusive evidence then you'll need to do it to stationary targets where you can reliably hit the same DR target in the same spot 100% of the time. In other words you'll need to test on other players like the people who put together that website I linked did and you'll need to run the test several times.
---
There was no scorchbeast.
---
Can‚Äôt be bothered with the carry weight. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I always drop them near my vendors, hopefully someone who can use them will pick them up.
---
Fix what? It's to use a Syringer, not pipe weapons
---
Can confirm it works with the SYringe gun. I modded the one I used to do Damage over Time.
---
Went to the war memorial with the Yao Guai in the back parking lot, jumped up to the roof of the museum which anyone can do without Marsupial, shot the bear with a lever action until it was \~10% health, and then switched to the Syringer. 3x syringes later it died and the tadpole badge was mine.
---
Best of luck!
---
[](/cefilly)I just did a test on the Furious legendary effect, it's the one where your damage increses after every hit on a target. [This is a Mirelurk queen's health after 15, 30, 45, and then 60 hits.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/249279013510578186/579356643842719764/Furious_test_15_30_45_60.png)  
---
It doesn't appear to increase per shot damage at all to my eye.

Downvote me all you want, but seems people just want to play with OP god guns than accept the truth that that there‚Äôs definitely something wrong with the BE lasers. Show me a video of you 2 shotting someone with any other bloody explosive gun with just splash damage and I‚Äôll delete my post
---
Killed myself with a mininuke during the "find jangles the monkey " quest event in the forest carnival. Had a level 3 guy laugh at me and steal my junk.
---
Weird flex, but ok.
---
I run into this too. What I've done is back out of build mode a few times and it works eventually for me.
---
I play every day as well and have not had that experience. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
I hope they learned to not add future content in game files before it's release so dataminers can't spoil it
---
Don't I still get hit with taxes this way? I mean if I sell an item for 10k caps or 9999 caps there is still tax involved.
---
Distant Thunder to be specific
---
Yeah, lasers don't explode.
---
Ye colonel
---
There were 2 deathclaws and simulation they transformed intro scorched deathclaws, the din't change nor the level.And there were no  Scorchbeasts.
---
I told you UTC would confuse them
---
Why? You plan on staying under lv35?
---
Just have it give enemies a glow around them when the effect is working.
---
HE CAN'T KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THIS
---
Since it hasn‚Äôt been mentioned heavy gunner PA builds with Emergency Protocols chest mod is an absolute beast in PvE applications.
---
Oof üò´
---
I haven't ever altered my machines.
---
I do think your 2nd line could be the factor, as I have my CAMP under the Harper's Ferry bridge which is quite a popular spot.
---
If its above a staircase, then I've had this trouble too. The only roof piece that works above stairs for me is the one that is just two slants that meet together...the one that looks like a Monopoly house...I'm sure there's some architectural name for it. Still haven't found a solution myself.
---
If you read through that terminal completely you get the plans for the Brotherhood of Steel Recon rifle. It is basically a hunting rifle with a recon scope on top of it. You can make it at even very low levels so it's a nice rifle to make a few of to drop after people coming out of the Vault. You can use these rifles to Mark enemies artillery strikes
---
I had a camp for a while west from grafton, had a few buildings I could build in and around. Looked pretty cool but didn‚Äôt like the location.
---
North to the WS trainstation are same train items you can build in. Im currently a little south of WS station (near the powerplant at the rail) which has some sweet raider-like buildings you can build around. Wouldn‚Äôt really recommend it though, my CAMP gets messed up pretty bad every login. 
---
Vault 51 (north west of the map) can be a nice location but again, pretty far away from everything.
---
Wait, what?
---
You can see how much damage you're doing?
---
Everything I try to place ends up on the roof or the next floor lol. Getting a bit sick of anchoring things down with rubber mats.
---
I thought building was supposed to have been made easier with the last patch.
---
If you actually use a recon scope to spot all of the scorched at the Distant Thunder event without killing them all instead, it fires at the location to end the event.
---
Yes. It could in Fallout 4 too.
---
I used to make custom weapons via console commands, and an assault rifle harpoon gun is wonderful for climbing the unclimable thing.
---
There was no  Scorchbeast and they transformed simultaneous.
---
[We literally just had this thread yesterday] (https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bpqwaj/if_the_flare_gun_is_fired_upwards_that_should/)
---
Ah right sorry, hope you can find a way to complete it
---
I actually kept mine just to the fun of using it.
---
Jetpack + crossbow/railway/harpoon = super climbing.
---
Did you still want to buy that red asylum worker uni?
---
Like Silent Running!
---
Maybe the goulish perk should make you look goulish
---
They‚Äôve added a decent amount of stuff, but for the most part it‚Äôs still very repetitive.
---
Might have a explosive but prob not a tse one. Will check on my lower level toon. Will message back if I do.
---
I made a post on this too. Like please give us something? I'd totally main a bow if I was better.
---
It's a good day when I find a suitcase with 30-50 40mm grenades.
---
But even as a heavy weapons enthusiast, I don't even want /free/ missiles or mini nukes. Both weapons that use them are woefully underpowered.
---
They nerfed all the weapons so much, that the the meta now is a stick. Which only drops from the SBQ, so good luck punching her enough to get her to drop one. There's only one person in the game right now who managed to glitch kill the queen, and he duped like 20k sticks, but he's charging like $20 rl dollars, so only his best buds have sticks, and they're all raiders.
---
Good luck playing with no weapons, when his "raider" buddies do nothing but kill steal, because they can do massive stick damage, and the rest of us are just using dull rocks. Then they start beating us with the sticks (thank goodness for no slap dmg amiright???), and call us stickless trash.
---
So, if that sounds like fun to you, then you should join our S&amp;M roleplaying group, the "Stickless Wonders". We meet every Tuesday, but don't accept invites from some guy named Mo0kish, he creeps even the wierdos out.
---
Hahaha that level 3 had a good day then
---
Yes I‚Äôm on xbox. Message me. liloblivionlil
---
Genius!
---
I mean if you have higher level stuff thats fine too.
---
I know that. I was just saying how much harder it is to sell average gear nowadays. Lol
---
No I just dont play this game as religiously as some people so I dont level up super fast but if you have any TSE rifles over 35 I would take them too
---
I‚Äôm looking for someone. If on PS4, you do me and I‚Äôll do you.
---
Whoah. That's like 1 cap per transaction!
---
With this one crazy trick, you could be a hundredaire by the end of the year!
---
Are you willing to trade for your 2 wwr pieces? :)
---
Sorry I missed you. I‚Äôll check tonight, but I should be sitting on a solid amount of ballistic fiber. If you need me to gather anything else let me know. I appreciate all the effort on your part.
---
Nah, that's over 6k value lol
---
just had to redo my entire camp(somehow placed something under the ground) and apparently u cant place a full sized brick wall on a half height one its so dam annoying....
---
Not very valuable, but maybe a niche pvp player out there will pay 1-2k
---
Oh, man, I wonder if you can do this to place your camp in ‚Äúunreachable‚Äù places?
---
Make the syringer a weapon similar to Ana‚Äôs biotic rifle in Overwatch!
---
They should put a cannery workbench in the game.
---
We can "can" stuff that we cook.
---
Scorched Deathclaw can spawn itself too. But it's so rare outside of SBQ fights
---
Does pemican expire? Can you make it? I got some starting out the scouts mission.. Was really hoping to learn that recipe.
---
I have never seen the recipe.
---
Feed the people event makes unperishable cans of stew. It procs pretty often too.
---
Idk if you can make it or not but it doesn‚Äôt expire.
---
If you nuke the nuka-cola plant it will spawn bloated glowing ones carrying nuclear material.
---
They can't even make this game work on current gen. What do you think?
---
They changed them. They spoil now.
---
I thought they changed them back in one of the patch notes?
---
I've gotten 3 Possum and 1 Tadpole from the new event, and the 2 daily things. 
---
Plus right now there's a bug that when you get the plan, you already "know" it, so you can give it to other people.
---
Maybe they did. I am not sure then.
---
Yes.
---
May 7th patch notes, they changed them back to not perish.
---
But were they rare or the common ones?
---
Omg lol. Like in Far Cry New Dawn. Some people thought it was a bug. üòÇ
---
How do you find all of those legendaries I have a hard time finding even one star items
---
How do you find all of those legendaries I have trouble finding even one star items....
---
Even if its a tough recipe i hope its out there. Irl pemican is really dried meats and berries ground up and mixed with fat. Be a good use of all that sugar and salt i find everywhere.
---
Probably tasts like shit but ever since rimworld iv wanted to make some ‚ò∫
---
Nah, you are selling a Uny/Sent LL for 3500 to CMDR, my offer for a Uny/Cav chest was 2500, I'll just hold on to it and sell it for what it's worth later, good luck on your hunt for your pieces.
---
My test specifically considered that, and are you insinuating that aim sway in the 2.5 seconds that the minigun fired to shoot all 60 shots of my test is to blame for a supposed 150% increase in damage being completely undetectable? That much of a boost should have made the first 15 shots look like nothing compared to the last.
---
Crap your on PS4 my bad. Because funny thing is I have one at 3 star 45lv on Xbox. üòû

Pc or console?
---
but i mean you leave the world first right
---
ROFL, you think I care what you think? You can't even think up a coherent argument so you rely on making up things I didn't say. Nowhere did I say software at all. But keep trying. Now run along after being called out.
---
Before they added content that's all this game was good for, farming legendaries to sell on the player market. I had a particular route before they nerfed it, and always checked vendors. If a roll was good I offered to buy it from other players and sometimes was able to trade multiple pieces. I have over 800 hours of legitimate play so it's really just time investment
---
for some reason i was expecting a rad toad pet but I guess i should learn to read lol
---
Um, that's implicit in Quit to Desktop, right?  First thing it does is log you out of the world.
---
well try actually clicking leave world first , see if that makes it stop
---
&gt; I'm not saying you're wrong but the pvp was advertised as agreed on and opt in - you engage in pvp and if not you become wanted if you "break the law" and when people could have friends clear wanted tags it meant there was no consequence to murder.
---
Not at e3 it wasn't, it was pushed as pvp like rust, and dayz. Both games have open free for all pvp that anyone can kill anyone at any time.
---
&gt;I get pvp and survival. but to me being a survival game doesn't have to have pvp in it. I have played pvp games and even pvp in this game but I don't find it fun to kill people period but especially hunt people down that don't want to fight at all and murder them.
---
But survival games literally mean PvP, that is what survival is as a genre, survival and battle royal games, both of them are pretty much the same, only difference is survival games also include hunger and thirst normally, and sometimes cold and heat.
---
Lol np thanks.
---
RIP metal husband

Explosive Bolt Loader
---
&gt; Every cap counts! 
---
You know, the irony is that I read this and think, "Well, once you have more than 10,000 caps, it doesn't really matter, does it?"  But then I'll religiously go around a loot the 1-3 Caps off every Super Mutant I come across.
---
I understand. I don't recall that being advertised - so it's possible I'm wrong on that. when I got the game in beta it was not advertised as free for all pvp.
---
My first play through took me around 80 hours and I wasn‚Äôt over level 60. Loved every minute of it.
---
Why I said e3, not the Beta.
---
I love that. I don't try to stay at the counter for too long when someone shows up.
---
I give up the 1 ‚≠ê legendary items to the vending machine to get scrip and sell the higher level items at my vending machine.
---
Agreed it gets annoying when people just keep shooting the imposter even tho they are doing no damage idk how many times I‚Äôve been the only one activating the pylons
---
My new favorite quest is the Jr Robotics tour at Robco. I feel the voice acting in that quest .
---
Have you got atomic shop skins on them? You can‚Äôt trade or scrap them if you do.
---
Hopefully they can. I'd like a bigger house.
---
go to fo76 bazaar
---
understood.
---
Looking forward to hunting down bee swarms, for the 10% to get the drop in order to craft the proper bolts.
---
Screw it, I‚Äôll just buy them from someone else who did all the work, so I don‚Äôt have to. Yay player vending!
---
Yeah it ends up being from your moms house....(insert yo momma so fat joke here)
---
agreed they are so worthless and take up so much damn space
---
&gt;a program wrote in c# will act the exact same as any other game also written in c#
---
which is ""software"- just as an operating system is software that you load onto "a computer"- people can read the context, literally been talking about computers as hardware and even posted a link of someone who made their game experience better by optimizing their hardware, i.e.. their computer and it is ignored.  
---
of course it is, you are only here to troll
---
I might not be on for a bit, will let you know.
---
This works for me as well.
---
Yeah I get your points. A whole server type would probs kill the system and maybe a word blocker like other games with in world chat. So cussing and other disturbing stuff would be censored
---
Alrighty
---
Why not both?       -Dora
---
What are you using it for? I feel like back when I tried to use it, it didn't work for whatever I was trying to get it to work for at all. But I of course can't remember what that was lol
---
Actually it doesn‚Äôt even make a difference because as he stated, whether he prices it at 49 or 50 he still gets 45 caps. So effectively this is only saving 1 cap from being erased from the game economy, big whoop.
---
That's why you should just sell it. I sold my high capacity for 5500 caps
---
Especially through headphones.
---
Depends on your perks... commando rifleman etc. Choose one that matches your desired build.
---
Preach. I've seen high-levels that expect mid to low levels to basically do the work for them and I've seen oblivious low-levels running around getting tookened out by the Gutsies. When I finally get on the mic and scream, "I ain't doing this shit by my goddamn self," some of them get the message, hopefully before it's too late.
---
Took a screenshot too when i came across it aswell lol
---
Common issue and Beth is aware üôÇ
---
There should be one drop ever that one person gets lucky enough to get. It would grant the ability to give everyone a permanent molerat disease. The amount of rage would be immensely satisfying.
---
My computer doesn't need any more optimizing, as I followed everything bethesda said to do, and yet the issues remained. Not to mention my pc is well beyond the recommended specs, even tried running it on my HDD instead of my gaming SSD. Didn't matter.
---
The coding is the issue, not the pc's. If it were the issues of the computers being different other games would have just as many issues. They don't, which is why I pointed out that LoL and PoE never had anything close to any of the bugs this game has had. Yet you don't understand that even if the games are different game styles, the coding will still be the same. So if those companies are able to make computer games that don't have these issues, then bethesda should be as well.
---
Yes no matter what but instead of the buyer paying 1 more cap that just a thrown away in taxes (literally nothing) the buyer saves a cap while the seller still gets the same. In the end result Bethesda the evil taxer will not get that one cap keeping the currency inside the game.
---
Currently I have Expert Commando, Expert Rifleman, and Tank Killer for my rifles
---
It seems so. On my first try she rose from the murky depths and totaly whalloped me in my silly swimsuit  &gt;&lt;
---
Honestly just grind out the badges from campfire tales
---
Nevermind, figured it out myself. It is perfectly fine to clobber the intended target into an Inch away from death and then do the coup de grace with the weapon needed for the Badge.
---
Fallout 76 connects to the closest AWS server. I don't know exactly how they find the closest server, but I would guess they start with existing geographic information as they has tons of datacenters. Go to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ and see that your location is correct. If it's wrong then either you are using a VPN or your ISP is doing something weird.
---
me too, I've had my house at capacity for a long time now. I was thrilled when they did the budget edit and made lights cheaper. as it is now I have to delete an item if I want to add anything new, and I've given up on trying to get a pet since i'd just have to kill it again if I ever wanted to edit another item.
---
I always try to be all conduits because I usually have too many stimpaks and nuka colas. I have no problem with helping as long as everyone is doing their damage to the dang thing. Sucks to get a white wolf fedora at the end but you‚Äôll never know if you don‚Äôt try!
---
I lol‚Äôd
---
This is pretty much my thought process and why I said what I said. Personally, I think if it continues to get support and content after this year is up, then the likelyhood of it being further supported on next gen goes up. That's only of we see a roadmap like the current one though.
---
I could also see them stopping and taking what they learn, then after starfield and ES6 and probably a new core fallout, going and trying again.
---
It's slowly becoming one of my favorite games and I originally was
---
 meh about 76 after 40 something hours, compared to my 1000+ in all the others combined. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
---
They also need a star value.
---
Things like The Gutter and The Fixer aren't actually legendaries.
---
I drank nukashine and ended up there.  Didn't get the reference as I never played Skyrim
---
Funny enough I seen one regular goul turn into a legendary when I killed it. Looked really badass, but also made me jump because I wasn't expecting it to get back up. That being said, totes agree - it looked cool.
---
AWOL Armaments is tough but always has a max level 3 star at the end, sometimes 1 or 2 more during waves 1-2.  Leader of the pack for 3 easy low level legendaries.
---
If hawk eye gets explosive arrows then so should we lol
---
no more time to play with you  have to go to work where we actually build and repair computers
---
(and again, I don't take you seriously- mess with the settings yourself to see what may work- but me not gonna have any impact on your "beliefs")
---
I add the taxes to my price.
---
 I want to sell something for a 100 caps I will mark it at 111.  If I want to sell something for 50 I will mark it for 55.
---
Simple math. I don't worry about the taxes since I don't have to pay for them.
---
Yea at this point me and my friend are making a miner themed gang out in the ash heap with all the stuff that‚Äôs come out, the blood raider excavator skin made me switch from a responder to a ‚Äúash raider‚Äù so to speak, with the lack of people I raid mole miners now.
---
I built near a random encounter spot and I would love either option. I feel like I put my base too close and now the event doesn‚Äôt always pop. It‚Äôs there sometimes but I feel like others may have wandered through and triggered it. 
---
I like my area but don‚Äôt want to kill this encounter for everyone... having the no build zone around would certainly take the guess work out for me.
---
I properly quit all my applications.
---
You can solo all 3 conduits quite easily with 3 points in First Aid and Field Surgeon makes it easier. Admittedly it's a bad idea without. I use the same tactic that never fails. Perks as mentioned, use a cryolator on deathsheep and stay out of the gutsies way. It's mostly the gutsies and the fire that's a problem.
---
Please present your data that supports your claim that the game has ‚Äúnowhere NEAR‚Äù the same player base or micro transactions that other MMO games have.
---
Crossbow shoots stempacks
---
There's no recipe for it yet in the game's files.
---
So they did, but I assumed they must've been confused. Ah well.
---
Needs to have exploding Rambo arrows.
---
I wonder if they will ever fix it
---
You should put that in your resume for Bethesda, bro. Sounds like you've got some real game changers in that noodle, choad.
---
Apparently I was wrong, I‚Äôm not sure why I thought it appeared but I guess we can just sum it up to radiation induced madness
---
I assumed it was a mad tea party as well, because of the tea cups and the hats really. Lol
---
It‚Äôs tough for me because I have basically no HP. As a sniper I like to stand on the cabin and clear out the mobs to try and keep everyone else alive. I‚Äôll take a pylon if I don‚Äôt see anyone else grabbing it but I don‚Äôt last that long without popping all my stim. 
---
Any other suggestion on how a build like mine can help?
---
The same amount of money I would put on a negative response to the game in this forum that isn't developed from an echo chamber.
---
One of the most frustrating parts for me is, no one pays attention to who is acting as a conduit.
---
If you‚Äôre a conduit, especially if you‚Äôre during 2 or all 3 at the same time, and you pull agro, you can‚Äôt spam stimpaks fast enough, but if you don‚Äôt instantly die, you‚Äôre still acting as a conduit until you do die, and most importantly can be picked up without interrupting the damage phase.
---
So please, for the love of god everyone, pay attention to who is emoting help for a revive, because if they‚Äôre your ‚Äúconduit‚Äù, everything resets if they die, until someone reactivates whichever pylons.
---
You‚Äôre literally wasting your limited time and possibly ammo by ignoring them to get in a ‚Äúfew more shots.‚Äù Guarantee you‚Äôll spend less time going to pick them up than it will to reactivate pylons to restart the damage phase.
---
I know the event can quickly turn into a lag filled quagmire, so trying to pay attention to everything all at once can be a major challenge, but try your best to stay on top of things like this best you can, so that we can all beat the event, together, instead of getting frustrated at failing half the time, and then no one shows up and it fails all the time.
---
It‚Äôs like paying with card at a store. They put the 3% charge to the vendor by the card company on you. Same here, the extra tax by Bethesda gets put on you.
---
Theoretically yes but it's a lot of work. If they became popular again I'd def enjoy it
---
I saw my first mothman in about a month last night. I killed him and the bastard didn't drop me a wing.
---
Bug/pumpkin grenades.

 They are not uncommon, its hardly a flex.

Some camp plans are solely from quests / capping workshops

Fasnacht donuts never expire and they have an amazing food to weight ratio.

Good luck hunting down cooking oil AND not scraping accidentally though.
---
Every time I accidentally scrap a cooking oil before I manage to stash it, I die a little inside. üò≠
---
Yes but it's rather rare. I've managed to get most except forest and red.
---
Yeah, the only time I‚Äôve been in a group that successfully completed it that was my drop. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
---
I can‚Äôt take that kind of damage for any extended period, but I always take 1.
---
Only two things are certain in life: death, and taxes.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't have any NPCs you can talk to. They can talk to you, but you can't talk back. they will talk to you via holotapes, notes, and other recordings. It feels organic, as though you just missed somebody but they left a message behind. The reason for this is built into the story, but the behind the scenes reason was to lower development cost. It means fewer voiced lines and less writing.
---
"Never played Skyrim", Damn, never thought I'd hear that in my lifetime.
---
Ah, I didn't know that...I'll go back and check.  I know I have a couple of pieces of armor that I've painted so I'll see about removing them.
---
Excavator PA gives +100 carry weight, afaik no other PA's in game have this perk.
---
The serums are probably gonna connect into the Arktos Pharma update that‚Äôs coming soon, probably craft them in the basement
---
Nuka Shine bottle in there as well
---
Lol sometimes they are. Fallout 4s story was some of the worst shit I‚Äôve ever played.  They are good at environmental design and making worlds feel alive but they really lack when it comes to writing and main stories.
---
The best part of Bethesda games are the side quests. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever really been interested in the main story of a Bethesda game ever other than Fallout 3
---
Yes. Occasionally you will find them in the wild but mostly at the Scorched Earth event.
---
Appreciate the in-depth response, thank you.
---
How does that help? I actually dont know
---
Nah
---
I do have The Fixer, which doesn't come up in the sell list...but I have other unnamed armor and weapons that still do not come up on the list.  But I'll have to check and see if what wintermute0010 said above works for me.
---
Sorry don't have them anymore. Can make you The Fixer, or a decked out handmade/lever if you want.
---
You need to mod PA parts for +carry weight bonuses in your case.
---
50 cal worked for me.

Make sure to pick up that new foil outfit from the atom shop.
---
Aoe damage that most builds/armour won't mitigate. They're really easy to build up a stash and just throw the things everywhere. This is only a theory, mind you. I've killed players with a gamma gun easily enough so pumpkin should work. Tried the bug bomb to kill myself for the backpack challenge and it worked too quick and a little too effective lol
---
I hope so too. All the updates have roped me back in and me and my friend have been playing almost every day for the last week. I don't see us stopping either.
---
Design flaw. There's nowhere near enough prep time for the people who join. You have to finish what you're doing, stash all your junk and switch your perks and hotkeys around (because it's a totally different challenge to the rest of the game). Then you show up and try to figure out what's going on in the giant mess.
---
If you don't start the event with enough players to handle the conduits then you're probably doomed.
---
I've noticed there's a height limit on the camps. I'm at four stories up and can't do any higher. Won't even let me put wires, a roof or anything on the walls

Returned one more technical data just now and received the paladin paint.

To me, it seems like ‚Äúmeemaw‚Äù said through a gas mask. In West Virginia, at least, that‚Äôs what we call grandmas.

I just did it, free range. No issue

Growing up in cub scouts we got a "whittling chip" that acted as proof of earning the right to carry a pocket knife.

I straight up thought it was a liscence everyone got as they grew up. Like a drivers liscence or a degree.

Definitely lived in that reality for a bit too long.

There's one in the cranberry bog, sometimes 2. I got the atoms there.

It is just north of the vault.  I will see if I can find a better description.

Yup!  It worked.  Thanks!

Also while your at it fix vaccinated! Some "diseases" do not seem to be resistant. I.E. Rad worms, glowing pustules. If a disease cure fixes them then vaccinated should apply for resistance.

I saw someone yesterday on xbox wearing old man winter. That's the only one I've seen in game so far.

To trigger a flame thrower hallway. I've built about a hundred bases and have never gotten these to work I've tried even hooking them up to each other still nothing

I have a 4x5 3.5 story building on a bridge, with water purifiers below it. And still modestly decorated. I would love to add some more to it though. I agree with op, I'd gladly pay more if I could fit it in

I have seen it too! It was selling at a vending machine for 7500 caps.

more and more damage the more hp you lose, up to around 200% more at under 20%hp
---
Here. I saw at least 2 posts and dozens of comments of people having the same issue.  Not sure what platform.
---
do something different till you are at a higher level. do not try and rush the game, I have over 850 hours and just getting started.
---
Which quests?  Post your GT I can help when I am not (not ATM, but generally)
---
No worries
---
You might have to be the person that literally gets the last hit in to count as you killing it. Like the final blow or whatever they call it
---
I recently bought several 1*-3* legendaries from the Whitespring vendor for very cheap (full Unyielding plus Hard Bargain plus Beer). I'm assuming it's a person or people who are hurting for caps, or simply don't want to lug around a bunch of junk equipment waiting for scrip cap reset.
---
The best thing you can do is choose between automatic and non-automatic and stick to that. I prefer riflemen myself but that‚Äôs just me. I run around with a lever gun and a semi-auto handmade.
---
If it's like it was before, you may need to land the killing blow for it to register.
---
Thank you! I've made a similair post. It doesn't work right with the terminal, traps go off regardless if it's set for hostiles only and even disarmed.
---
Where
---
*starts crying*
---
I completed it, but it wasn't an event Sheepsquach. It was one in the wild.
---
I can help run it real quick. ign rotoass
---
My gt is milkmonst3r626 trying to do some of the main quests
---
It's 60 seconds for the conduit
---
It‚Äôs my second character. I want to try a different build. I‚Äôve already took my time on my level 131 character
---
I've seen mothman twice. Both times I had a stare off, as he's a much higher level, eventually fired and he disappeared. Does he ever attack? Is the only way to kill via 1 shot?
---
Where is the terminal? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen this before.
---
Congratulations! :) (do not read on that fecking robot's voice :D )
---
I added you
---
I‚Äôve seen a lvl 50 legendary one at Top of the World several times.
---
Only if i can have him refer to me as Mr. Fuckface.
---
Watching some of his videos he does come across as someone that puts in the effort :)
---
Lots of results on YouTube for this. Here‚Äôs the top one.

Is this what the 1% do to get all those tax breaks? gotta try that next tax season
---
Yeah I think of it has a c.a.m.p made for one , not a family h.o.m.e.  My enclosed spread is (2) 1x2 and 2x2. 
---
Also, I try and incorporate outdoor aesthetics, backyard to reduce the amount of walls and roofs. Turrets, I  only have one that is placed near my fusion generator
---
Nice!
---
I wad reading this on youtube and someone commented saying that you can do the same with the railway rifle and its betters BECAUSE the nails are larger then the arrows of course and easier to step on üëç
---
It would seem mole miners are not included in any of those categories. I still get +60% damage when are glowing though :-)
---
Have you read the terminal associated with that? I haven't actually seen the quest, but I'm glad I know to look for it because the terminal entries by his owner made me so mad.
---
Others will also give +100 if you add calibrated shocks mod... on the note, since excavator already has +100 base, can add to excavator for a total of +200 carry weight.
---
I don‚Äôt have Be laser but i have a TSE (farmed from WS), it‚Äôs nowhere near as effective as my bloodied pump shotty, yes with beam splitter it fires several beams at a time but it‚Äôs easily negated by Fireproof if the explosion is your concern. When PVE it‚Äôs also not as effective as other weapons, and it breaks super fast even though Bethesda supposedly made it last longer. 
---
They took them out of the pool because it‚Äôs just too far stretched when all they fire are beams of energy, there shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äòexplosive rounds‚Äô from those weapons. They took gatling laser out but the normal gatlings and miniguns are still there and do more damage.
---
I work at a coffee shop and I‚Äôll play music from the game/era in the mornings fairly often. A lot of people actually dig it, definitely a great perk of the job. üòä
---
I wish! No, just the displayed damage such as when you inspect a weapon. The actual damage for that weapon, if sneaking with Ninja 3, would be over 30,000 per hit.
---
I get most of my caps from endless pillaging and priced-to-move goods in my vending machines. I still pick up every spare cap I find.
---
Spoiler...they all end up bad. üòÇüòÇ
---
Everyone is dead.
---
What the actual fuck are you blabbering on about.
---
Not only is it true, but I just did the whole east highway and the only enemy i found was a giant crab. And since it was a highway, Id figure its traveled in and maybe more enemies spawn there than through the wilderness. No not really. Try it out someday.
---
Damn, you're really butthurt about this. My only "complaint" was that I have to walk everywhere, and I wanted some sort of vehicle.
---
But apparently, I don't even play this game. Keep on trucking friend.
---
I'll give ya 4. That one was kinda eh.
---
The rest though. I've always loved the stories. The lore. I'll agree the main quest wasn't usually the main focus but the side quests, lore and usually npc characters (I'm looking at you 76) was where they shined on story telling. Along with making living worlds.
---
I try all the dirty tricks I hold in my slevee to get charleston camps bombed into oblivion and I believe this to be right thing to do.
---
You need another one?
---
TLDR
---
Or you can meet up with someone to craft one for you.
---
Gt same as here, lvl 54. Might be on tonight or tomorrow depending on free time.
---
Appalachia needs this tax revenue have you seen how poor of a condition the roads and schools are in.
---
Sure buddy, ask mommy for an icecream.
---
No one's buying this, Todd. Nice try though.
---
I got lucky and revived someone during free range. Those super mutants did him dirty
---
No, keep playing. -Bethesda
---
lol sometimes I unload dozens at WS station bot, or just put them in the sac at the door, just to free up some space.
---
What do you mean by the Purveyor. The whole game is a gambling machinery, we dont even know if it is going to be a good game when it is finished :o
---
PA helps tank it. Normally I play bloodied sneaky snipers and I cant hold it at all, but recently I was on my main PvE char when the event triggered and I help the three pylons by myself until the beast bot died. That took 30 super stims, indeed it did, but it was possible to achieve on a build that was not even PvE optimised.
---
\-Insert Sarcastic Voice- No, a knife with a long blade
---
Your Power Armor alone does not add carry weight. Excavator is the exception with +100lb carry weight. 
---
Their are a few exceptions. If i remember correctly PA adds 11strength, so if below 11 strength, those extra points would add 5lbs per point.
---
Any bonus carry weight from regular armor does not carry over, that includes unyielding +strength points and pocketed. 
---
Underarmor also does not count in PA. 
---
All PA have option to add Calibrated Shocks. Which adds +50 per leg. Since excavator already has +100, means you'd be able to add an additional 100, bringing it to +200lbs total extra carry weight.
---
I join other people‚Äôs workshop defense events all the time. Way easier than getting one yourself and you get all of the rewards.
---
I agree with this. It would help the in game economy for sure! Better than them just going to waste in the shredder as well.
---
Yeah, my sacrificial machete's poison damage didn't do much at all. Only good on squishy enemies
---
Even the way that Borderlands handles the partying system would be a good way to standardize it. The Message portion of your system would just be replaced with the Active quest of the party leader. I guess it could get kinda fucky with the inordinate amount of quests someone can have going at once. I do like the idea of being able to type messages, but as a console player typing out text is a nightmare.
---
This also works with the railway rifle and harpoon gun.
---
Yeah, you just show up and it triggers if the time is right. I usually wait till it‚Äôs visually dark because I have no idea how to tell time in game.
---
I'm just leveling my 42 alt if you want I can join and share inspirational for xp buff.
---
Yes I agree and not being able to destroy them is restricted pvp which doesnt vibe with survival to me. Survival is borked right now and it sucks
---
Legendary script microtransactions incoming...
---
I‚Äôve been hitting up a bunch of pack events lately and they‚Äôre pretty good for scrip legendaries.
---
i'm on PC or i would love to help don't no what else to tell ya but just have fun
---
Actually... Wouldn't mind a syringer mod that did that.
---
If you nerf stealth boys, then vats based builds would also have to be nerfed. the widespread use of stealthboys is a direct meta response to the widespread use of vats crit sniper builds. its the only way to deal with builds that can auto aim crit your head from a hundred meters. and on top of that, a majority of those builds use legendary perks like chameleon, making them crouch invisible. if its really that much of an annoyance for you, buy berry mentats and use your gun sights. if you are frustrated bc u are a crouch chameleon vats sniper....too bad i guess? using stealth boys is how to counter that so u cant auto aim people in pvp. just as keeping distance is a way to fight melee users, or using energy weapons to fight PA users, or using stagger shots to counter sent/assn builds. this is how a meta develops. without some type of counter ability, pvp wouldnt be able flourish.
---
I'll be on tonight I think if you wanna team up n get some challenges done
---
Good news, you can buy crossbow mods sometime in the future with *microtransactions*
---
I made that up
---
Passive: everything that's only relevant in specific out-of-combat situations. From the top of my head that's primarily Hacking/Lockpick, Trading and Crafting/Repairing, excluding crafting perks that affect weapon durability. These don't affect combat and are also only needed when not in combat, which makes them the most swapped cards. They will be swapped out before roaming again unless you forget it, so they don't take away perk points anyways.
---
The sacrifice I'm making here is spending time on a tedious system that - from a game design perspective - isn't well thought out. The one and only reason I have some of these 'passive' cards equipped is because I haven't really gotten anyting useful to fill the space yet and that they are fucking separate cards increasing the amount of time spent on stupid pointless shit. After all we still have the same idiotic inventory management from FO3 after 10 years, so there's bethesda innovation for ya.
---
To tie passive cards to your build resp. spent perk points you could have them activate when you've got enough points for the card, or you could have a second passive tree with the same perk points as the active tree - preventing double stacking perks you wouldn't be able to use concurrently, though I'm not sure there are such combinations aside from the unnessessary split hacking/lockpicking.
---
If they just added perk build saving/switching, that presumably would be the easiest solution, and also the only solution I would trust bethesda implementing without fucking it up.
---
Can I buy some pot from you?
---
memorial area..?
---
True
---
It's not just you.  over 40 play throughs.  about 25 failures due to players NOT collecting fire wood.  1 possum badge (first ever attempt ... nothing since).
---
Biggest nightmare is when a bunch of noobs go there to ‚Äòtag‚Äô for reward, using garbage melee stuff, then attempt to run away. I can almost do this myself when I get the conduits and mow down the sheep from rooftop with a heavy weapon. Takes only a few minutes. But when you have a bunch of low levels try to hit her with their DCG then run away, the ISS will chase them and often times to far corners of the area where my weapons can‚Äôt reach. Super annoying and frustrating when a bunch of level 20 - 60 show up and do this, failed every time.
---
i got the fridge for my backpack the other day its fabulous for gathering nuked floras
---
How do you get the other player to collect fire wood?   .... can't finish the event "collecting bugs" due to ginormous failure of community NOT doing the event.
---
Sure thing mate, add me and I‚Äôll join ya!
---
Has anyone noticed that the youtube videos of taming are almost never on a PC?  You can tell by the "Pacify" and "Taming" icons on the screen.  Is is possible that it is much more difficult to tame a creature on a PC?
---
I'm on ps4 and haven't had any issues with walls, buts this: 
---
&gt; Wires constantly require you to exit camp building and renter it to connect them. Same with the random Cannot Place Nothing is Selected- all the freaking time.
---
THIS IS THE BANE OF MY EXISTENCE. I'll either get this, or when I switch to another item in the build menu, it'll be invisible, and of course I have to exit and re-enter build mode to fix it.
---
Additional damage to feral ghouls?
---
He's my uncle.
---
I liked 4‚Äôs story but it was too short imo
---
I have never gotten a plan for raider except from a quest with rose and that was it. As for the scout armor I am not sure if thats true and if it is it needs to change.
---
Do you have a swimsuit on?
---
Any help for a player on Xbox now would be appreciated: Sharkey2112
---
I've seen several posts saying it doesn't block the spawn point but actually moves it to a different spot in that area.
---
Personally I haven't been able to replicate that (find a base at Charleston and no matter what I can't find another spawn point but it could be the base owner already activated it and it's on cooldown) so take that with a grain of salt. Maybe check around the immediate area to see if something spawned rather than its usual spot when a base is built there.
---
If it makes you feel better, I went into this battle *SOLO* thinking it would just be me vs the robot... boy o boy i was torn a new asshole on that day
---
I had issues with the mission as well. I was able to complete it by starting from the dock and going to the left first. There‚Äôs a buoy all the way out on the right that seems to fail you if you touch it any time except as last. 
---
I would suggest testing the buoys on the right side of the dock first to find which one it is. Once you identify it go back to the dock and start going from the left side and touch that one last. That‚Äôs how I was able to complete it. Hope this helps.
---
Yes its doing my head in
---
100% agreed...... good thing we are all adults here
---
Just give us that thing that you used to get scanned in nuke silos or the same one you use to be injected with the vaccine for the scorched plague
---
so the same reason that people use chameleon? or use vats? utilizing a game mechanic to get an advantage in a fight. also there isnt a way to "1shot" someone after recent balance fixes. they put in a stealth patch dmg cap. u can 2 hit people, but not 1 bullet/ 1 melee hit, 1 kill anymore. the time to kill can be VERY fast so it might seem that way, but u cant 1 hit anymore, at least thats how it is in adventure mode (not to mention that u still have to engage in pvp by firing back bc of the reduced dmg, so its literally impossible to 1 hit kill a player in Adventure mode). survival mode is a different story since it uses an older server state.
---
Sure what level do levers come in?
---
I usually run all 3 pylons myself and hide and let others kill him so I don't take more damage because others don't know or don't bother. (After I've tagged him of course.)
---
I‚Äôm sorry that sucks!
---
Its the one on the far left thats failing the quest every time no matter what angle i go to it
---
Well now you can just doss about with it haha
---
I had similiar issue. I tried doing it in different order and it worked (even though it specifically says any order, I couldn‚Äôt get the clockwise way to work).
---
Another test for me to attempt
---
Who cares. He gives you stuff.
---
I didn't know it was a daily challenge.
---
Yep. Sometimes I'm not in a waiting mood, if the scrip counter is empty, to the vendor it goes.
---
Yeah sure after I immediately get downvoted and Waste my time on this form.
---
Yes, it still does insane damage with the right perks. Both unarmed and one handed are still bugged so it benefits from both perks at the same time. Only weapon to do it.
---
Is a female my dude
---
You better throw them led lights on there el hefe lol!!!!!!!
---
You can pickle it!
---
Sorry due west of the vault.  Halfway between the vault and the pig on the middle contour line connecting the trees and the hills.  Trying to add an image.
---
I've never really used a railway rifle so my knowledge of them comes from fallouts previous and the rail spikes in the wear very small. I shall defo check into it.
---
i'm cool with this, even if it takes a bunch of each flux to make.
---
Oooooo the possibilities :)
---
Sure! The more the merrier!
---
[](/ff63)I dunno, the mysterious stranger at least had that thing where Nick was investigating him in 4.
---
The first time I saw one, he flew away as soon as I got too close. The second time, I attacked him from afar and he attacked as well, but he flew away for some reason when his health was about halfway gone. He left behind some kind of dust with some items though
---
When you flip the circuit breaker **up**, the doors should open automatically
---
Sell stuff until you hit 18k, then buy a popular serum recipe like marsupial oe adrenal reaction. Craft serums and sell them for 300-400 caps. When you crack 18k, buy another one. Repeat until you have a ton of different serums and watch the caps roll in...
---
I upvoted man this is well written.
---
Well, haven't played since the update. Now I know.
---
&gt;the base owner already activated it and it's on cooldown
---
I've actually wondered if this is the case. I can't imagine the spot would disappear, but if the base is constantly triggering it, when you walk through it'd be on a cooldown. Effectively though, it doesn't really matter, if it means no one else can get the spawns. 
---
And I'll totally try wandering around to see if the spot is simply moved, but I spent an entire day doing Charlston, hopped dozens of times, and never found anything anywhere else when a CAMP was there. But maybe I needed to look farther away? Interesting.
---
I don‚Äôt know how much you pvp, but the BE laser kills people easily with just splash damage
---
Taken photo's of every different kind of generator at my camp and others...
---
Pretty sure that‚Äôs what a sword is
---
I like to think she has a back story but as we are just strangers to her, she has no reason to tell us
---
I would pay serious money for the option to look like a ghoul.
---
The editor gives that error when it somehow messes up the selection, just exit out of build mode and re-enter should fix it.
---
I typically use the "9" tactic just to make the prices more appealing. Good to know I'm actually saving some caps!
---
Yeah, the copper dome gazebo next to the tennis courts, the one with the statue on top. Drinking fountain on the wall inside of it cures all diseases if you drink not collect.
---
Are those rugs? Lol
---
Yea the breaker is up I must be glitched
---
Thanks chief üëç
---
Not much unless it's legendary
---
Thanks Chief üëç
---
He also abandoned his family in Nevada to come save your ass, or something. Right?
---
Pistols, regardless are in bad shape. Mainly because of how the perk points are distributed. One of the weakest gun classes. Hopefully Beth gives them a hard look into improving them in the near future. Otherwise they are outclassed by most other weapon classes regardless of roll.
---
the Colonel is the kid pleading with God to bring his dad back?
---
if so,  i think everyone has had that moment in their real lives.
---
Very common for people to miss it. I just showed it to a level 160 guy a few days ago. Before you go in the main doors karma turn right and there is a terminal sitting on the side of a pillow. Read through all of the entries.
---
I just want to be able to put ladders in my camp... dang stairs.
---
Nope. Anything with atom shop paint is destroyed if you drop it or try to sell it.
---
Ok, thank you
---
I can‚Äôt even place my entire structure when I move my camp, now. It was a beautiful 3-story thing, and now - no matter where I place it - it either tells me it is ‚Äúfloating‚Äù (it isn‚Äôt), it is ‚Äúoutside the build area‚Äù (it isn‚Äôt, unless the height of the build area has changed), or ‚Äúintersecting‚Äù some other object (it isn‚Äôt).
---
The change from ‚Äúfloating‚Äù to ‚Äúintersecting‚Äù is a single pixel. There is no green ever. 
---
Had to entirely rebuild my structure. :(
---
&gt; That much of a boost should have made the first 15 shots look like nothing compared to the last.
---
Not really.
---
&gt; are you insinuating that aim sway in the 2.5 seconds that the minigun fired to shoot all 60 shots of my test is to blame for a supposed 150% increase in damage being completely undetectable? 
---
Hell not even aim sway, the miniguns cone of fire will never accurately give you dps numbers on a mob like the mirelurk queen unless you do the test hundreds of times. 
---
You're not understanding that the difference between where your bullet lands on the mirelurk queen makes more than 150% difference in damage, so if the aiming and or rng of where bullets land are poor, it can easily change the results of your test. The mirelurk queen was a stupid choice to test on of any mob for that reason. The amount of damage depending on where you shoot any mirelurk is insane and that effect is amplified on the mirelurk queen. Again, unless you can accurately shoot the same spot for all 60 shots (literally impossible with a minigun + mirelurk queen) your test is 100% invalid.
---
And news on Canvas bag?
---
Bethesda is paying employees with their cap revenue. They quit.
---
I haven't tried myself. If it's possible, I'd consider that a bug. Since at the moment you can't drop or trade anything from atom shop without getting warning that it will be destroyed instead. So do at your own risk and expect it to get fixed at some point.
---
I have the same problem, same exact quantity lol
---
If I'm wearing excavator armor at log in.   My carry weight is 595.
---
If I get out, or just equip it after logging in without having it on.   My carry weight is 495.
---
This is with calibrated shocks and motion assist.
---
Unless it was changed with recent patches there  is no plans mods in the game yet  for anything but regular excavator headlamp.
---
I mean I get it for reasons of servers. But at the same time, it kind of incentives me to change my look up every once in a while. Usually when I move a camp, I like to rebuild it trying some new looks.
---
I highly recommend hiring a CPA to help find some tax advantages!
---
You're welcome. I've found that pretty much all weapons and armor are worthless unless it's 3* I trade all 1*and 2* in to the exchange now. I tried selling 1* and 2* in vendor but no one buys it unless it's cheap and they just go trade it in for scrips
---
Sorry man. I tried racking my brain thinking about where I saw him and can‚Äôt picture it. I know I had done Path to Enlightenment and was over in the museum area, , but I don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs where I saw him.
---
Not sure anyone has posted possible spawn location on here.
---
HEY YOU, YOU'RE FINALLY AWAKE
---
25,35,45
---
you may wanna retest pve, there are a shitload of effects that do not show in awareness. (AA, endangerol are the two big ones)
---
I'm torn on what I'm about to say, but I think there should be a significant no-build zone for higher players near the overseer's camp. The intention is to welcome and help new players, which is awesome, but it seems like it sort of spoils the flow of coming out blind to this new world. I keep changing how I feel about it, but I think it'd probably be the best thing for game experience.
---
so its affecting mods as well? this is more serious as I thought
---
Months later, this is still happening to me
---
Lol thank you for that laugh. I totally forgot about this. His lines every time the stranger popped up were gold.
---
If armor was reduced I'd expect a difference in number of shots to kill, but yeah only doing one of each isn't much. I'll try another set or two ... and maybe different targets, if I can find one that isn't a pita to do it on :D
---
I wish we could save multiple builds we could hot key or something like that.
---
I feel like they‚Äôve really toned them down compared to Fallout 1/2/Tactics, and I still love all the references in Fallout 3 on.  Granted, the games not made by Bethesda seemed to focus almost entire on goofy/pop-culture references, whereas BGS was great at those little ‚Äúuntold stories‚Äù scattered throughout the map. Like two skeletons locked in struggle in some factory office with a gun nearby and (I think) a burnt photo nearby!
---
I had issues with the quest at first too.  Then i realized I kept failed after I was out of the water for any brief period of time.  So I tried to stay in water (without running out at all) and then it worked for me.   There was a mirelirk queen i was trying to kite too... so it wasn't a fun experience!
---
Thought you were doing a scorchbeast not the whole crystal cavern. Was fun though. Glass cannon is glass cannon =\] My pvp character
---
Would be nice. I've seen it suggested several times in the last month, don't think it's gained any traction though. Have yet to see it get the attention it deserves.
---
The alternate suggestion floating around is perk loadouts. So you can save 1 as Combat, 1 as Crafting... so you can quickly toggle between the two instead of messing about with all your perks 1 at a time. Keep in mind PC users already have this option with mods, it's those of us on console who are at Bethesda's mercy for something official.
---
Haha thanks so much! You left before I could pay you though!
---
And governmental inefficiency.
---
Use a mic and direct them to do it. If that doesn‚Äôt help, just do it yourself. I make it a habit to pick up firewood intermittently in case no one else is doing it.
---
I tend to find if you leave it till it turns to the bloody pile, they always turn back up üòÉ
---
Aluminum?  I want black titanium.
---
You need to get them to put *Mr. 5 by 5* and *Country Roads* into the rotation.
---
More caps per the victims lvl
---
Link?
---
There's a puddle&gt;! by one of the decontamination arches at the Enclave bunker entrance!&lt; at Whitesprings. Convenient if you want Toxic water and not just Dirty Water like from most other ponds/streams.
---
Wait really? What's the clean up quest?
---
what system?
---
lol best way to find out is to load it up since you already have the game.
---
WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN TO ME?
---
Ah no worries. I was done earlier happy to help.
---
Found one at the vendor in pleasant valley ski resort
---
I fucking wish, once I‚Äôve been there long enough to figure out who I need to talk to I will for sure
---
Actually depending on the legendary effects and level even 1* and 2* can be sold. Low level 1* are great to sell to new players. Decent 2* are great for whichever level. I‚Äôd love a lvl 50 quad explosive 10mm for example. And there are many others that would love specific legendary effects. Purely depends on what they are.
---
Yes, yes they are.
---
Oh boy not for me tho, post got instantly downvoted and nobody offered help
---
My 2 most amazing moments were when I killed my first queen and used the camera emote, everyone run behind me and got in a horizontal line so I could take an awesome badass picture. I have video proof of that. And the second was me sitting at the watoga train station benches, waiting for the guys to finish trading, and a couple more people sat down too. Like it was some public customer service or something.
---
Im still trying to fix up my main character from the beta. I had an alt with god rolls and forgot about my main. I went back to main and was mortified by all the weight perks i needed and the low damage weapons i had. I fixed up my main with the knowledge i had from my alt. My main is now  a bloodied/unyielding just like my alt and does more damage. Knowledge is power you just gotta pick something and stick with it and try to use as little weight perks as you can
---
Suppresses damage output of target, increases hit probability by highlighting them.
---
The radium rifle? I think I've got most mods for it but not all. 
---
I would just charge as much as any other gun and if I'm honest I kind of just mod weapons for people if they give me the materials I was unaware people actually charged for this service.
---
what do you mean Incisor isn't melee class specific?
---
And all of the toxic valley
---
i can make fasnacht donuts that dont expire for some creepy reason.
---
though just keep canned food on you and put some plants at your home.
---
Now go climb to the very top of the Monorail Elevator.
---
Probably the default value. Most people these days are just looking for legendary stuff.
---
I also have a rifle build.  Some days I use the full set of Comando perks with an automatic handmade.  If I run low on ammo, or just want to switch things up, I switch out perks for Rifleman and use my semi auto combat rifle or hunting rifle.  
---
I like being able to switch between different ammo groups.
---
You have to be the conduit for 60 seconds, not 60 times.

Thanks for the reply :) I would agree for most weapons. The Radium rifle just has a very slow rate of unlocking the mods and requires thousands of screws, springs, nuclear materials etc to make enough rifles to get all the mods. I wondered if there would be a demand.
---
All of my yes.
---
The one where you clean up toxic waste in the tadpole chain.... the repeatable one
---
This funny.
---
The hunger and food spoiling timer could be extended.  I mean jeezus, even with perks, sometimes I'm surprised that indigestion isn't my character's worst enemy.
---
Census Violence can drop all the weapon plans, I‚Äôve gotten Power fist, Gauss Rifle, Stimpack, RadAway, and both the protected and shielded lining for the marine wetsuit which is arguably the best under armor in the game.  I believe it‚Äôs the only spot in the game to get those two plans.  Also gives rare recipes. Definitely one of the few events I always do.  The fact that it‚Äôs just 5 minutes Is cool too.
---
Yes. I tried loading  the game, and i gave up after 15 mins. PC?
---
Let us craft explosive arrows.
---
Yep... Way to go bethesda...
---
Well, yeah. Just thought I'd mention Whitesprings because everyone hangs out there for nukes and trade bots, and the puddle isn't very obvious when you're walking past it.
---
The timer is far less now than what it used to be.
---
Be nice to get some heavy weapon mods for ballistic weapons. The LMG is just sad.
---
Mole miner gauntlet has the extra blade but feel you. I have a death tambo I love, and most melee weapons have no mods at all. I want extra jingles of doom.
---
Coding that would probably end up making the arrow ‚Äústick‚Äù to our hands and launch us into trees and cliff walls and stuff 8-$
---
Could be because there's stuff missing in your Fallout76Custom.ini.  
---
The [Archive] section needs to include everything listed in the lowest block under [Archive] in Fallout76.ini.

Here's mine. The last two entries are for mods, the rest is mandatory.

I think, this nukes can be faster than meele lol.
---
Yeah that's true but majority of them are junk imo
---
Not having to travel for rubber and plastic would be nice, though. I have to go to Grafton HS then Watoga HS and even then don't have enough mats for 50 costumes. Also I use all my plastic which sucks.
---
.
---
if you‚Äôre referring to the number that appears below when you sell something, that‚Äôs the buyers total ammo count and not what you‚Äôve sold (appears in brackets beneath the sale)
---
How's that working out for you, does it keep out the rain?
---
Hahahahahahaha I‚Äôm dying üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I would add a 0 ti the end of those numbers. Theyre big requests. Also i doubt they have any way to actually track that.
---
Same as other fallout games. He sometimes appears in fats and pops a shot to help you kill something
---
The game is depressing and a huge let down. I‚Äôm mad and upset.
---
Man, that‚Äôs unfortunate.
---
Thanks, is it worth getting?
---
I live for them.  Well some of those glitches.
---
Does anyone else see the clipping on the Coat to the pip boy? I‚Äôm male and the armor is clipping pretty bad especially when I use the Lever action or Handmade. Come on it‚Äôs 2019, why is this a thing!
---
I've been getting the same thing
---
I would welcome a decent short or dot scope, but also different types of ammo.  Ammo that snares and slows the target, anti-Scorch rounds, explosive rounds, and of course: the R9X.  A high-speed barrel of swords and surly, snarly rage.
---
Possibly with a rocket assist.
---
Happened to me back in January. So not new and doubt will be fixed anytime soon. 
---
Only way i know to bypass is you need to complete the questline all in one login. Once the new questline starts, it shouldn't reset anymore.
---
You don't get 100% of the profit from your vendor. Only 90%
---
"Then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the McKetrick supplicants, they chose a new form for him: that of a giant Slor! Many Shuvs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the Slor that day, I can tell you!"
---
Which missions, and what system?
---
I'm pretty sure the Legendary's you were seeing at in game vendors were being sold by players. Once they gave a good reason for us to keep them, people stopped  selling them. The last time I was able to buy a bunch of them up was the day before the legendary vending machine dropped into the game.
---
I work in a small town kinda country bar and whenever I open I put on Marty Robbins radio on Pandora and it immediately turns into the Prospector Saloon.
---
If you have something favorited it should say "do you really want to scrap favorited item?" when you're in the menu
---
In my opinion, not really. If you‚Äôre using vats then things like grim reapers sprint and four leaf clover are far better.
---
Last time I was there I was level 47 and ended up taking two of the pylons! Luckily people revived me twice.
---
You guys are also forgetting the idiots that run away once they get agro dragging him way far aways so no melee can hit him. You want help? Stand still and die like a man or pop stimpaks like crazy. But don't drag him away from the fight cause you're a sissy.
---
it works the same as other fallout games, he randomly shows up to help you kill stuff and then leaves. here's a funny thing that i see sometimes, he can show up in pvp fights, but it seems that it is based on player hp. and since the time to kill is so fast, he usually shows up right as the player dies, and he just stands there like "well i guess im not needed" and then disappears lol
---
Pretty sure he is claiming to have only gotten 16 caps from selling 12k worth of ammo. And is saying he wants the 10k he would have gotten for selling it.
---
you should. Skyrim, despite the MANY memes and jokes, is a VERY GOOD game.
---
It says it on the card
---
Yup, seen several posts over last few weeks about it.
---
Here is a post from a few days ago someone saying they replicated the bug.
---
Mysterious Quills dont auto scrap
---
They put our good, good boys in the game.
---
Indeed.  In the early days I was surprised my character's agility points weren't actually suffering from the gluttony.
---
u/Katastrophi_
---
u/NodoBird
---
u/thesadsammy
---
i was in the same boat as all of you, had never really had more than 2k caps, took me a long time to save up for items that cost 1k, etc.
---
i‚Äôm a relatively casual player and don‚Äôt have time to farm for stuff; i just want to play. but since player vending was introduced, serums have become an especially easy method to get caps as long as you have the hard bargain perk. i don‚Äôt know how to make a single serum, but it‚Äôs really common to find people selling them for around 200 caps. don‚Äôt pay more for them than that, but if you find them for 200 or lower, buy as many as you can, and then sell as many as you can per day to vendors until you‚Äôre rid of them and you‚Äôll have at least doubled your money. at 4 charisma at level 3 of hard bargain, i sell to the vendor for 430 caps. 
---
10 days ago i only had 2400 caps, and it had taken me a loooong time to save that from just selling hunting rifles and crap to vendors. but i found a player vending machine selling serums for like 110 caps. i bought as many as i could, went and sold three of them to a vendor (which cleaned out his daily caps) and went back to by as many more as i could. i sold three serums off per day for 10 days (just at the start of my play session) and ended up with like 12k caps.
---
this is truly the easiest way i‚Äôve found to make money as a casual player.
---
Ok could I do a 35?
---
Here‚Äôs my theory...
---
The Legendary Scrap Machine is a lie. It‚Äôs actually a series of interconnected tunnels (kinda like the trash cans at Disney... no really, Google that shit!!)
---
I mean - they ARE miners - they could totally build this...
---
The grinding noise etc... it‚Äôs all just special effects, loud enough to mask the sound of the underground crew in their asthma masks hauling your stuff. 
---
Your weapon or armor is whisked away and taken to an armory to be inspected and cleaned. They give you a paltry few Scrip, bring the good stuff to Mrmugh, and begin again...
---
there are a couple people who offered up their gt.. read all the replies
---
this was the one thanks
---
Its the  "that day" part that made me think of Rick Moranis in Ghostbusters.
---
Definitely solid... The only thing I'd change is switching out Good With Salt for Bloody Mess
---
It hasn‚Äôt rained yet, so I‚Äôm not sure if they will or not. If not I‚Äôll consider it a sometimes water feature.
---
Has been around since beginning. I dont think its a glitch
---
Never ran into that issue and I've had my fair share of launching nukes and fast traveling to locations to watch them go off.
---
Seen a few pop up in vending machines. A while ago dataminers found that dogs were supposed to be part of the game as a companion. Assume they‚Äôre to do with that
---
[](/ce10)Listen man, I've shown you my method. It's simple and to the point. You can pick holes in it all you want, but at the end of the day I don't believe that the furious legendary does 2.5 times damage. If you could prove that then it'd rewrite the meta in an afternoon. If you have actual proof like you're implying you have then you should make a post about it.  
---
I couldn't find a lick of evidence of *any* decent testing of the furious effect on reddit(and bear in mind that I consider my testing decent, so by the standards you apparently use they might as well be asking a magic 8 ball), so if you just make a post of your tests, footage of them, and your methodology behind them I'm sure it'd take the place by storm.
---
Found one at launch. It‚Äôs only good for scrap atm.
---
You're on PC? I'm interested in your instigating shotgun:)
---
You hear that, Bethesda? Sounds like they're saying they'd would love to give you money if the build cap was bigger.
---
Used to have my camp in almost the exact same location, it was always great watching those go off in my observatory
---
I always figured that's what your mouth is for. I mean seriously, it kills me to see folk asking for more ways to emote, or type, when we have voice chat, and $10 can get a working mic for most systems these days, unless you want a super fancy one. The real question is why no one ever uses the voice chat that is already in game, and what would it take to get the community to use both voice chat, and flare guns to actually interact with each other? It IS a multiplayer game after all, so it shouldn't be too difficult to talk. Even went on a mission with a dude while his son was babbling in the background one day. If he can talk, so can we lol.
---
This literally just happened to me...any word on whether this is a know issue?
---
Lucky, I've met the Flatwoods monster twice, but that's with one char at 120, another at 70-something and one at 50-something.  
---
That BoS questline is pretty far along the questline; you'll meet more tough stuff. Exploring some more and getting some more levels/gear before continuing is an option.
---
You get the fuck over it that's how
---
Was just about to post a similar question. I just sold 1800 .50 rounds at 1 cap each. I dont think I received any caps at all. Checked the vending machine and the ammo is definitely gone
---
Cost of parts +10% for time. It's how my mechanic buddy prices his work outside of the shop.
---
Surely it‚Äôs not suppose to be in the game, that would be the stupidest thing to put in
---
Not really. You just need to farm all the materials from nuke zones. Places like whitesprings have a lot of fauna for flux. Can‚Äôt remember if it was mainly I don‚Äôt think it gave much cobalt, but it gave quite a bit of one of the others. Can‚Äôt remember which
---
Don't be anti-social
---
Do they match the drapes?
---
Launch on Harper's Fairy. There's a massive amount of Violet Flux and plenty of Ghouls to get the hardened and glowing mass and radiation fluids.
---
Yeah I will just have to complete a quest line in one go. Just annoying when I don‚Äôt have the time for the longer quests.
---
This is from the May 7th patch notes:
---
**Punch Bowls:** Can no longer be activated and beverages can no longer be placed within.
---
* **Dev Note:** Who‚Äôs been spiking the punch?! We‚Äôve had to disable the functionality of Punch Bowls for the time being, but you can still build and place them in your C.A.M.P.
---
You serious? The story was nonsensical drivel filled with some of the worst writing I‚Äôve ever experienced not to mention the voices protagonist really took away from the charisma aspect of the game
---
Thank you! Still think this is a cover though. I think the punch bowls we're part of a dupe and reworked for that reason.
---
Put some different perks in endurence. You can fix limbs with a single stimpack. Or get life giver for some extra HP. But you can get some other perks in E you dont need rank 3 skeleton
---
I almost hit 1000 yesterday, and then I finally found a ammo vendor with 5.56.
---
The most passive cap farming I‚Äôve seen is for players to have max industrial water purifiers all locked, they gather all the water and go sell with hard bargain on. 
---
I don‚Äôt farm caps myself and mostly casually play, but my cap balance stays pretty low at all times.
---
I don‚Äôt have an answer But now I want a TSE crossbow Rambo of the wasteland.
---
Do you have a legendary explosive cross bow? If not then no
---
I was just getting on here to ask the same thing. Sold 1800 .50 rounds for 1 cap each and didnt receive anything for it. I checked and the ammo is definitely gone but still received nothing for it
---
Go the path of the winding something or other, the oriental building. Out in the cliff area there will be a table with an unrepaired crossbow.
---
I dropped those items, picked them up again, and could trade them at the scrip!
---
Definitely had less then 30 items in the vendor I was using.
---
I'v seen people selling this in their vending
---
Yeah as a PvP build, with full sentinal and some sent/ass, dodgy, serendipity, lone wanderer, fireproof and dense BOS combat Chest. I know exactly what you're talking about, I PvP the entire time I'm on the game aside from farming and with no vats crits they can spray in my general direction and it's instant death.
---
When ONE weapon significantly out performs any other in PvP, then a balance needs to be made.
---
Now that ‚Äúall‚Äù vendors can be found in Whitespring, you may want to spend some time there perusing the wares? At least you won‚Äôt have to hop around much?
---
It‚Äôs still not level. A fresh lvl 50 often hasn‚Äôt completed the full story or hasn‚Äôt had time to either farm for perfect legendaries for their build or the time to accumulate to cost for them all. High grade gear and mods from the enclave for example. ‚ÄúLevel‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean much, it‚Äôs the gear that makes the difference.
---
Yes you get the same message whether your stash box is full or you are camp budget is full I believe.
---
Somehow no one have a problem with serendipity that gives 45% to dodge any dmg not only bullets
---
The only plans that I think are missing are the initiate bos power armor skin. So you can find sgt to elder ranks. They all have slight color differences and ranking differences.
---
Yes they exist, I have an AA and a Two Shot
---
Watched tons of nukes never once since beta have I had this happen to me.
---
Naming glitch. I imagine it's not high on the priority fix list
---
New Vegas has an autodoc for sure not sure about 3.
---
I love encryptid on my unarmed tank. It is really punishing for those paper tiger builds. I typically tank the imposter while holding one conduit. It makes the fight go extremely quickly when one person just stands completely still blocking all of the imposters attacks.
---
Go play survival  literally what it is for don‚Äôt fuck up adventure by ruining PVE players fun.
---
You need high-rad fluids, glowing mass, hardened mass and raw violet flux. The first three drop from mobs in nuke zones. The last ones can be picked in nuke zones, if the right kinds of flowers are there. Check out the flux map from mappalachia:  
---
https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY  
---
Green thumb (perception perk card) will allow you to pick twice as much. Remember that raw flux will spoil, so don't wait too long to craft :)  
---
So yeah ... spam nuke zones, kill stuff, pick up purple flowers. That's about it.
---
I mean it's a good way to keep people playing without having them spend real money
---
You cant trade em or drop em
---
They cannot be sold, dropped, traded or scrapped.
---
Whelp. Time to replay 4 again... never used the mysterious stranger perks. Nick is my favorite companion.
---
Left over from fo4 but we can dream of companions
---
Yea but it would be fixed by now and it isnt
---
You aren't concerned this will be an ambush slaughter fest? An ambushing squad fires a flare and anyone teleporting in gets ganked.
---
Just watched one hit whitesprings and was kicked right off. I‚Äôm fricken DONE.
---
Not sure if you take requests or you have an easy way to figure this out.
---
I‚Äôve got a STR guy, and I‚Äôm not doing Bloody / Unyielding. I can bring my own Whiskey, but I‚Äôd love to find a nice spot with some combination of honey / aster / ferns to reliably make the steeped fern tea. Is that something you have an interface someone like me could punch in and look up? He‚Äôs built for strength, but he doesn‚Äôt like walking so I‚Äôm trying to find a new camp spot for him that can achieve some of that.
---
Huh. I don't think I got that reward. How do I repeat it?
---
It doesn't matter what I use. Nothing works.
---
[This](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=6a545ce&amp;d=sf2ej2pp1pl1pd1pk1p01c72ic4a11a00a30sg2a71am2la2lr1l71l11lt1lu1lv0an2e60eu0&amp;w=&amp;n=Bloodied%20Crit%20Build&amp;m=259cf) is what I came up with, any thoughts? I appreciate your help!
---
You are missing something actually. Bethesda made it so that when you log off in an area, all the loot that was there that you‚Äôve already picked up won‚Äôt be. Everything else is reset except for the areas you‚Äôve recently been to.
---
No I definitely use it to prevent vats, never get sneak damage in PvP from just having a stealth boy on, have even watched back through fights to see after hearing that claimed before.
---
I've got a few chems favorited and a set of specific items that I don't want scrapped such as weapons and armor. so I can't add any more to the favorite wheel.
---
You also have to kill one with an automatic weapon. I used an LMG.
---
THERE ARE DRAPES?! üòÆ
---
I think you're overreacting to a degree this seems like a troll.
---
I can't seem to do it fast enough by myself ... I can't make it between the spawn points without loosing AP half way through the thing ...... Are there more than 3 spawn points for the "dry kindling"?
---
We're all dwellers and wanderers in binds now, raider.
---
For auto rifles, it depends on build. If you are free aiming, use a handmade. If you have a vats build, use combat or radium rifles. The handmade has expensive AP costs, 16.5 per shot automatic. The combat and radium are 13 AP per shot automatic.
---
Before you go on a scrapping spree, unfavorite everything then only favorite the things you want to ensure don't get scrapped? Then rebuild your favorites after you're through. It's an extra step but it'll save you some pain in the long run
---
Damn it Todd.
---
Paladin? Officer?
---
Gott im Himmel, I've been looking for those things. If you're lying, you shalloth face the full wrath of the subreddit. If you're not, you're a courier to us all! Let's fucking go farm technical data, men!
---
Can't trade them once there fixed.
---
To add to what others have said, when you unlock it yourself, you'll need the Gunsmith perk to be able to equip the mods.
---
I have the initiate plan. Sentinel is missing.
---
Performance has definitely taken a hit recently. I stopped playing a few months back and just reinstalled this week.
---
I am getting like 20 fps with a gtx 1080ti, 32 gigs of ram and an 8th gen 6 core i7 processor.
---
So its not just you.
---
For 500 atoms you bet ;_;
---
That's not true. Plenty bugs have existed since start and have yet to be fixed. You have to remember some bugs will always take priority over others, if this one only affects 1% of users, they will not address it in favor of one affecting 20% of users.
---
I've found that if the name shows up on the camera it helps it count a lot better then just snapping away. I captured a workshop and made the small unpainted generator. The name popped up in the right hand corner and it counted for me.
---
I got Sgt. captain, lieutenant, initiate and knight paints. Still needing paladin, elder and sentinel.
---
Aid/chems
---
Aid
---
Man, I really need the neon letters. The regular light up letter don't "pop" enough.
---
It has effected a lot of people
---
Meds I think
---
Yea, that was my thinking as well, sadly wasn't able to get up there though. I'll give it a shot later, with the crossbow, just to put a final nail in that coffin heh
---
Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised, I'd buy em though
---
how did you manage to move him from the vending machine into the punji board pit?
---
Got a pickup with coffins outside of it, lots of notes from survivors in Flatwoods inside.
---
And Ceramic Flower Pots.
---
And all God teor gear has been duped like crazy and many lvl 50s have said gear.
---
As an epic settlement builder in FO4, the CAMP restrictions are severe in a FO4 perspective (I would build 15 x 20 self contained settelments from stacked foundations. Really fun. This game would turn into a screensaver if you tried anything like that in FO76.
---
BSG does need to figure out a solution.  They want Atom sales and homemaker type decorations will sell like crazy. Money left on the table until they can figure out a way to pack for Atom store stuff in CAMPs.
---
Did I say anything about survival or adventure. This was a general question. Its not like I can go to a lvl 50s cano and kill then in adventure. This is a truly dumb response.
---
It's dumb since they already have lights with you can cycle the color
---
Hey dude! I think honey is a pretty infrequent item so you'd generally farm that from Honey beasts at Middle Mountain Cabins, no? As for Ferns and Aster absolutely. Hang on
---
^this, usually people recycle three or so different areas. Hit all three then server hop and the first area should have reset (depending on the time spent)
---
Have never had the Genny name pop up
---
Agreeded this game was so buggy at the start, yes it‚Äôs gotten better but there are still plenty of bugs that needs to be fixed. Don‚Äôt think this is a priority since there‚Äôs a lot more game breaking bugs.
---
Lighter guns use less ap.
---
you don't need glow sight  all the time, mostly for nuke zones. I switch it out with tank killer, which I run 90% of the time.
---
Battered Fedora works too.
---
Works thank you
---
Mimes been sitting 2nd day now at 140, I guess that's a bit too high, but was worth a shot!
---
Once I realised I couldn't stack enough armor with rad resist (even with the legendary effect) to survive in a nuke zone I kind of just keep the level 3 cards equipped all the time for both food and chems.
---
I could probably ditch the food one and just carry around a pile of spoiled food and a few bottles of water but even thatvisnt really needed as there is food and drink in most buildings. 
---
Chems on the other hand are super needed as nuke zones require radaway and stimpacks most of the time unless you have a group who share ghoulish and rad sponge perks every time you go into a nuke zone but I'm not that lucky.
---
Take a picture of a generator not built by player . Any of the fusion generators that you can pull a core out of.
---
Himmel, Arsch und Zwirn, mein Freund! I shit you not!
---
I guess today was my lucky day. Keep farming, it is worth it as it looks totally bitchin'!
---
Exactly, in grand scheme of things, this is low priority.  Yes it's annoying but it won't prevent you from completing the quest if you can dedicate the time. I'd much rather they fix disconnects and crashes, or things that simply prevent progression.
---
Solid. Not sure what your fusion core supply is like but power user is good in intelligence to extend life. Gunsmith is fine but when you can repair to 200% with weapon artisan it makes it less useful to always have equipped.
---
And that helps me know values how? Not to mention certain gun mods reduce vats costs despite making the gun weigh more. I‚Äôm after an actual planner not a vague guess.
---
  Can mole miners speak english? Or are players communicating with the legendary vendor with sign language or written text?
---
Cheers will give that a crack üëç
---
I've turned in hundreds, yet all I've gotten was 3 lousy knight paints and 1 initiate paint. Comrade, tell me why I should keep farming.
---
Misc.
---
ahh thanks I'll have to keep an eye out
---
Shotguns are great at a lot of things. Especially crippling stuff (enforcer perk, agility, it's super powerful). They're kind of annoying against scorchbeasts, though ... you can rip the thing up when it lands, but that can take a while :)
---
Very underestimated perk. You can free 2 points in agility and strength if you equip 3 food reduction. No other weight reduction gives you that much. For pve is my choice. When i need to use PA for nukes i just swap the weight reductions cards lvl 3.
---
I would like a curtsey as well
---
Tank killer doesn't effect heavy weapons
---
How do you get mods for them
---
You are probably right. After doing some math if 100k players spent 10k we would have 100mil in taxes right then we would achieve all of them. But at least it could add just something for content during the coming content drought that‚Äôs coming before Nuclear Winter. I thoroughly enjoy watching enemies attack each other and getting to see a patrol of Enclave Mr Gutsy/ Assualtrons or a patrolling BoS sentry Bot attack super mutants would be nice to see every now and again. There‚Äôs already two or three groups of two Responders protectrons walking around the forest region and will attack wolves and dogs when they cross them.
---
Oh that's a relief
---
this happened to me last night.  was only a few thousand caps from ammo, but my cap stash did not move at ALL.  same number as before the sale.  just shrugged and moved on, but curious now ..
---
Is sharing the Fix It Good perk and mats out of the question?
---
I dont think you get what I'm saying . When u click on your name under the social menu it gives you the option to leave world try doing that first before exiting game
---
Sure it has. But even 100 out of 10,000 players is still 1%. And even if it is a much higher percentage, when compared to other bugs, it's not as detrimental to the game. While it's very annoying, you can still complete the quest if you can dedicate the time to complete in 1 login. Plenty of other game breaking bugs will clearly take priority over this.
---
+10 for statistics +20 for data entry effort +10 for write up. Excellent work. I enjoyed reading your observational results. It gives more power to your conclusions over data mining. You've inspired me to collect my own data.
---
Be happy then lol
---
But honestly, two weeks ago it was - climb up seneca rock und snap a pic of the highest point... such a pain.
---
Dude I wasn‚Äôt having a go at you to me the way your reads is that as so as you get to lvl 50 PvP restrictions get lifted and is a free for all, which to me sound horrible.  No you didn‚Äôt mention what game mode you‚Äôre talking which about why I brought it up. If you‚Äôre going to ask questions in dumb way you‚Äôre going to get a dumb answer.
---
Swapped a few things around to what I used to use for my heavy build.

A good all around heavy gun is the gatling gun, because it¬¥s very ammo efficent.

Well I was thinking about asking somebody to paint my PA accordingly, but it is just not the same in my opinion. The brotherhood is testing your patience, brother! I think it is worth it, but I also stopped trying multiple times along the way going: Ahh fuck it...

I don't have a TSE Tesla, but I'm pretty experienced with Teslas, and IMO, I wouldn't bother with the shotgun mod.  The thing about the Shotgun/Charging Shotgun variant is that while it looks impressive, it has a shorter range (which is more difficult to judge because the bolts fly everywhere) and only allows you to fire 8 shots before reloading, instead of 15.
---
Personally, I go with Charging Barrel + Reflex Sight.  Others prefer the Automatic version.  Comes down to preference.
---
There is a somewhat rare lobbing variant too which shoots little electrified mines.  I've seen it on some drops, but never as a mod or a plan (I'm not sure it can be learned).
---
i get what you're saying, except I exit to desktop several times a day, 80% of the time without issue.
---
I'm also factoring in other players with the same issue and the whole playerbase without the issue.
---
Somebody needs to nuke Whitesprings now. If there are only 1 or 2 legendaries on the whole WS circuit then there is something very wrong!

Uhhh..lol

The content drought wont be longer than 3 weeks for sure. As for enemy patrols. It would be nice to have more random events and encounters more.

Pocketed armor is weird, because it has a weight. And an anti-weight so:
---
A 5 pound chest with a 10 carry weight
---
  Out of power armor, weighs -5,  the 10 carry weight minus its own weight. 
---
  In power armor, it weighs 5 and if you where at full capacity, +5 pounds of stuff, that no longer has a carry spot, so possibly +10!
---
Try and find calibrated servos for the torso, gives you a +2 strength. And calibrated servos for the legs, each will give you +50
---
Yeah thing is, plants aren't that important in the long term. Sure, having your adhesive farm is nice but it's so easy to come by it's not that important.
---
It helps to have AP refresh armor/Well-tuned/Hard Lemonade/Nuka Colas/ or Rejuvenated (Endurance Perk Card) to assist with your AP deficit. Your best bet if you cannot accommodate what was listed is to tell other players what to do, which can be tough.

There are not more than three spawn points for the dry kindling.

The Crossbow does not exist with the Explosiv perifix, sadly

It is, thanks!

From your TSE Gatling Plasma test, with the Splitter mod did TS add one projectile or double them? Trying to decide which holy grail to save for between a TSE Minigun, Gatling Laser, and Gatling Plasma
---
I really don‚Äôt understand why this isn‚Äôt talked about more. When you price ammo at 1c, you don‚Äôt get 90% of the sale of stacks at all. Not even 10% most of the time. I‚Äôve sold over 1k ammo at one cap and only gotten 8c total. This is a major issue right now and why it‚Äôs kinda shitty to even price at 1c for both you and the buyer. They‚Äôre still paying 1c per ammo so they may pay 1000c and over 90% is just lost. Either give it away for free or use a mic and hang out at your camp letting people know you have the ammo in your inventory.
---
I guess what I meant, and it seems like most people would get this, is that once you are lvl 50 it's pretty much equal grounds in PvP other than the gear you have which cant be helped because its RNG.
---
Green thumb perk in perception works with flux and Good with salt in luck to keep it from turning into inert flux too quick.  Makes it all much easier.
---
 Yes you are, but not so much world hopping. Did you know every tin can has one lead? There are 9 in a Tin Can trap and at the Raider area in Camden Park there are at least 6 of those.

Oi mate, do ye have a license for that knife handle ?
---
Yeah, I don't get that either. Or where is the town hall in Flatwoods? There doesn't seem to be any entries on google on either of them?
---
well, I have my mic on all the time and chat people's ears off/ask questions if they let me.  But there arent too many of them it seems.  I also have had loads of issues being on mic and being of the female persuasion, but thats another story.  Just saying -- not everyone who plays video games as a hobby is as socially comfortable as you.

Mics help alot, another way i communicate with players on the ps4 is through the psn chat. Just invite them to a group party on psn chat and communicate through keyboard.
---
my bad, also when doing the heavy gunner cards, if you can start by only putting 1 point in all 3 cards, the damage percentage is better than maxing 1 card at a time. There are a lot of situational cards that only need to be swapped in and out when needed, like lock picking and hacking.
---
You are almost better off getting a real sports betting account lol
---
Yeah dude this is some dope stuff man
---
In the absence of perk loadouts id like to see a system where you essentially load out the perks at your workbench, BUT they are unavailable while out adventuring.  Therefore other players that do that promote community, and it comes as a choice in the game.
---
I think it is Misc. I checked my thing on my camp icon and it said I had 1 med and 2 misc. I thought this was a bit odd considering I had 2 serums plus some mentats or something on sale, and both are classed as aid in the actual inventory.
---
So for the purposes of player vendors it seems like serums are misc. At least it is for me.
---
I‚Äôm not a troll. I‚Äôm a normal human that is pissed at the game. I want to watch a nuke and watching whitesprings being nuked was going to be cool. Then bam, kicked off as it hit. Why is when someone gets pissed they‚Äôre a troll.

But if you get sick of farming, drop me a text. I know a good Power Armor blacksmith, who might be able to help :D

You are either moving or replacing the machines.

---
Unpopular opinion so I expect downvotes but Skyrim is generally overrated as a game.
---
The combat is clunky and basic. The story is very linear with few likeable characters and is clearly designed to show you 1) the size of the map and 2) everything you can do on the map. The levelling system is cool but can easily be abused in multiple ways. The dialogue is a bit rubbish. The quests are repetitive.
---
The map is a bit small too but that (and the questionable graphics) are a product of it's time.
---
Now don't get me wrong I loved it when i first played, and at the time of release it was so damn good. But compared to current games? Nah mate play something else
---
I just leave events where people do this. I'd rather fail it myself than do the entire thing for some stranger who immediately disappears after.
---
As far as I see it, if you‚Äôre in Survival you‚Äôre there by choice‚Äîso everyone is fair game. 
---
In Adventure, it‚Äôs a little more grey. If somebody takes a workshop, they‚Äôre technically fair game at any level‚Äîthey got the PvP warning and chose to take it anyway. If they‚Äôre level 50 or higher, they should know how the mechanics work. If they‚Äôre not geared/perked up that‚Äôs kind of on them. 
---
Personally, I don‚Äôt get into PvP in Adventure. Very few people are interested in PvP at all in that mode‚Äîincluding myself when I‚Äôm there, which is most of the time. I‚Äôve found it really fun in Survival, and I think that knowing everyone has explicitly consented is the reason.

I swear I traded mine to my mule for a pic challenge then got it back...

Awesome! If you wanna contribute to this effort, you‚Äôre more than welcome to send me screenshots. Not quite ready to share spreadsheet edit access though :P
---
I find legendary enemy somewhat once every 30min. Whitespring golf club has many, especially when nuked. Many event has legendary enemies, especially Horde events, uranium fever just had 2. And nuked whitespring area spawns a lot of legendaries. I usually find 10-15 legendaries there. Aaaand it also might affect that I play 4-10h daily.
---
Even broken ones cant be sold or dropped.

I have not moved the machines and have not recived the message that my camp spot is in a taken location. Also on the times when my stores have been reset i have been able to go to my camp and no other camp is there but my own

They are don't listen to what other people are saying. I'm lvl 50 and I drop people all the time who are in PA and 150+ anti armor weapons and fatass crit damage is easily achievable by lvl 50 and will get the job done. Few shots with my anti armor handmade then a crit with a black powder rifle or the dragon with +50% crit damage and most won't survive or have a chance to heal

If you need lead go to lucky hole mine with an escavator PA.  You'll come out with a crapton of lead ore.

As long as you have a decent acid supply to smelt with you'll have more lead than you can use. (Add super duper perk and damn).

was gonna say fuck but seemed too intense
---
Don't forget toys...amusingly/ironically enough almost every kids toy in the game has lead. Silos are also a good source ( I never like the excavator armor in the mine solution being somewhat p.a. averse).
---
Dropping them and picking them back up yourself doesn't work. I play solo, so I didn't try it with someone else.
---
No hard feelings friend. 60ish does make since because that gives you time to iron out the kinks on your build.
---
Well, this is odd.  I'm being downvoted for Misc., even though it's very much Misc. on my end.  I just checked.  I have have 0 Meds listed, and yet I sell 3 serums.  Maybe there's a weird inconsistency between what I see as a vendor versus what others do.
---
I've had a few ideas for this that I haven't really articulated.
---
1. New class of perks: Passive. Earned the same way as regular perk cards, but you're taking a passive instead of a perk card. Can also be earned from card packs. Unlimited perks. No equip limit.
---
1. Make crafting perks like Science/Science Master, Gunsmith and Makeshift Warrior Passive, and only holding their crafting rank bonuses. Roll the degradation reduction bonuses into any of the weapon class perks you have equipped, like Rifleman/Heavy Gunner/Shotgunner/Slugger
---
1. Reduce Rifleman/Heavy Gunner/Shotgunner/etc to a single card with 4 ranks. 15% per rank for same final total of 60%. Also provides the degradation reduction discussed in point 1
---
1. Picklock and Hacker baseline, earned as you level from 1 to 40. Rank 1 Picklock at level 10, rank 1 Hacker at level 15. Rank 2 Picklock at 20, rank 2 Hacker at 25, rank 3 Picklock and Hacker at 40. 
---
1. Fix it Good and Weapon Artisan rolled into one card for a 3 point cost. Allows you to Repair any item to 200%
---
I also wouldn't mind if they reshuffled some of the perks like Shotgunner into Perception with Rifleman, and the
---
I don‚Äôt think the tse acts like a normal Tesla. It shoots a ballistic explosive round. I have one and I‚Äôve searching for the shotgun mod. I‚Äôve heard that‚Äôs best with tse from what I‚Äôve researched, as they don‚Äôt do the normal arcs.
---
I feel it might be actually doubling the splitter output, as TSE GP is an unholy cluster bombing weapon of mass destruction. If you see one for trade (and you can afford it), go for it.   
---
TSE Gatling Laser is also very nice, quite accurate, with awesome sound and visuals, but has a lower dmg output than GP. TSE Minigun is ok, but quite ammohog and definitely worst from those 3.
---
The vending machines i think would have been better served in white springs and not at your camp. Renting your spot like taking over a work shop.with everyone's vending machines in the same place cheaper on the fast travel with more choices in one place. Plus keeping the lore that the robots of white springs want there 10% cut
---
Eh, then people would just put good items in for max caps and collect the fast travel fees all day.
---
Build your camp on top of a lead deposit, I got so much I moved because I didn't need any more
---
What I do is rename the stuff I don‚Äôt want to sell I add, **DNS**, before the name. Then it goes to the top of the screen and I can visually see which ones I don‚Äôt want to sell...it goes the same for things you don‚Äôt want to scrap if they aren‚Äôt legendary. I also have those things favorited as a backup. I‚Äôd rather have that stuff favorited as it‚Äôs more valuable to me.
---
Vending is kinda broken.  I have stash space but filled up my camp budget with sale items.  Now when things sell my budget doesn't go down so I can't refill my machine. Removing things from the machine doesn't make it go down either.  I removed a gun to reprice and couldn't relist.  I'm just stuck at Max budget.
---
OMG I sit down too. This is pretty awesome to hear. I love how people automatically do things like this.

When I see someone running by me, I move out of the way for them.

I wish I could even buy anything from vendors, so I can start my own gambling addiction.
---
What exactly is your question? You get 100 carrying weight bonus if you have a full set of excavator. If you switch out the torso you won't have a bonus.
---
Got a 3* instigating from the legendary vendor yesterday and was a bit meh about it. But it's a lot of fun combined with the covert operative park maxed out and can do some decent damage if you get the first hit in before the enemy is aware of your presence. Just wish the reload was faster!
---
Excavator armor has a boost in carry weight of 100 units
---
I really wish we didn't have people who enjoy destroying a great thing.
---
Well if your PS4 I have a plan for sale
---
You need calibrated shocks.  Go to the trade subReddits and have someone mod them.  It requires a fair bit of flux for them to do it and will be priced accordingly.
---
You have to have the complete set of excavator to get the carry weight bonus.
---
Now thats smart. Kinda like automatic doors at stores.
---
I'm seeing a lot of 2 star legendary's now way more than before.
---
Only a FULL suit of Excavator grants +100. Replacing one piece removes this carrying capacity bonus.
---
I did the same thing for the entire first day.
---
Lever action is good, although I don‚Äôt think anything beats a well-modded hunting rifle for long distance kills.
---
Would be nice to be able to unprime it as well
---
Also if your powered machine has no items in it your camp wont be public. I only have 1 machine with power and 2 not powered. When my items were gone from the one with power my camp wasnt showing as a vendor anymore.
---
Because it's too big and game does it for you. If you wanna move the saves it auto, if that doesn't place blue print the floors and wires first
---
(Just an advice, every day there are 3 or 4 posts about this same thing, so you may get some rude responses here).
---
Buy the flux on trade subReddits.   100 each for violet if buy in volume.
---
By contrast, I started this event with a team of barely Lvl50 players and it was a cruise. If you really want to start it solo then I'd strongly recommend setting yourself up to tank at least two pylons. Might be cheaper on stimpaks to take all three yourself.
---
It's easily fixable. Either allow more setup time (more like an SBQ nuke, which is far less time-critical), or don't deal damage to conduits until all three are taken.
---
Equip it and the number will change
---
Yes, at least one needs to be for camp to show up on map... however electricity isn't actually required for them to work. If i somehow stumble upon your camp i can still buy even if not connected.
---
3 or 4? Lol
---
Search function...
---
I'll save you some rude replies, it's not fixed and the new updates didn't make endgame content worthwhile enough.
---
At least they show a good sport. Unlike those who throw a massive fit. I had one guy complain to me about having pacifict mode on when I was just out shopping kept cursing at me. He had a 1,780 cap bounty and wanted me to drop all my stuff. I was asking for bourbon. Three players came from behind him and destroyed the guy. Afterwards they all dumped a bunch of booze at my feet before I gave them some stuff to compensate them.

I already had a full set of excavator but i wanted to make the ultracite armor since it had a high dmg resistance but once i made the torso i switched out the excavators and it bumped my carryweight down to 245, am i good or should i stick with the excavator. Oh and whats the max carryweight with the excavator if its at all worth making

Probably the head manager or the head concierge.  Or if you have an IT dept the lead IT guy.  Probably one of the three.
---
Yup ..
---
You need every piece of Excavator equipped to get the weight bonus. Changing out any of the pieces cancels it.
---
That was information I didn‚Äôt know either, so thank you!
---
I posted about this a while back. Basically, exit your power armor, remove all the equipment from it (head, torso, legs, and arms). Get back into the empty power frame and equip the arms, legs, torso, and helmet. Your frame‚Äôs 60/60/60 is now restored. You have to do this every time you exit your armor.
---
Rip
---
I've been thinking about this but haven't gotten a chance to try this out due to life. Thanks for looking into it and sharing!
---
Like i said. To get the 100 carry bonus you need to equip every piece of excavator. It's useless to switch out only the torso. Either you go with the full set or no piece at all. If you install the shocks you get another 100 carry bonus.
---
you do not need power to sell. you are powering them to place your camp on the map in a literal sense.
---
Yep. Got mauled today by sleeping gouls chasing me out the stairs!
---
Give or take, yeah. I mean you should always account for mispicked perk cards, stuff like that. Anywhere from 54-60 is when most builds should be completely finished perk cards wise. Gear is a different story. But I'm also a firm believer that if you're in survival, or you snack me first in adventure mode, you're free game.
---
I can't even get into van lowes anymore. For pictures that don't register I usually relog and it works every time
---
From what I've heard you can technically sell stuff without the machine being powered, but people won't see your camp on the map so you probably wouldn't get many customers that way.
---
Excavator is bugged, I think. It seems to add an additional 200 carry to your limit instead of 100 (300 with calibrated shocks).
---
Lol nice, I've used carpets as flooring in Fallout 4 a few times, myself, looks cool as a ceiling as well!
---
Could be connected to our Bethesda accounts, kinda like the rockstar social club.

Ok i get it so the excavator is good for carryweight, but what about the other PA do they have a decent carryweight? Or are they just for dmg resistance

Yep.  All of the Fast Travel points at The Whitespring disappeared for me today too.

I'm torn about that, too. On one hand I love helping newbies. On the other, when I start a FO game I want to really get a feel for it before I start accepting help (or in single player games, using mods). I'm glad I really got to explore on my own before people started handing me stuff. But not everyone is that way, so some people are super happy to be given stuff right out the gate.

Sweet, it did change. Thanks
---
Don't forget the monorail elevator has a bunch of weights at the mid level or the top, can't remember what it's considered.
---
The excavator is the only power armor that gives a carry bonus. The other ones are all the same. But if you want good dmg resistance you want to have the t51b it has the highest dmg and energy resistance but very low radiation resistance. If you wanna have high radiation resistance you wanna go for the x01 which has the highest rad resistance and very good energy resistance.

Something about that front nose/mouth area is just not right. It looks more like my cat's snout than a power armor helmet
---
I'm confused by this interaction
---
Maybe your xbox is about to take a poop? Graphix card may be on its way out.
---
I watch nukes all the time and im below spec on pc. I get stutters if i dont turn down some visual settings but have only been droped from one server since i started.
---
Also wonder if where you live or your Internet connection has something to do with it.
---
Thanks! I found it now. Yeah really messed up stuff and interesting.
---
Mostly florescent at WS, I didn‚Äôt find any violet.
---
I'm right behind you (I guess?), got BOS Knight SGT yesterday. Feels like I've made the trip at least 300 times now, but maybe I've just lost count. Have to admit that I like the grind, though, every new paint feels like a real achievement.
---
All the GOOD* players have
---
You'll get your fix in 4 months but till then buy our repair kits :) oh the irony
---
I must have had the good bug. Kept getting legendaries off normal ghouls
---
He's talking about pubic hair color...
---
Level is probably different or one is more broken than the other
---
Yep yep and also when you build a foundation but just like one piece won't snap in because the ground is juuuuust too high at that exact point and so rather than rebuilding you just stick some carpets over it.
---
Back to fo76, I've got my camp at that hanging bridge south of silo alpha and have used the little carpets to patch the holes in the bridge, because I kept getting stuck in them while crossing back and forth. Yay for carpets!
---
Lol, milk that for as long as you can
---
Oh I know...but I don't think OP knows
---
I've literally found dozens of reports, it's the same thing with removing camps when they can't be placed, it took them months and made camp building completly nonsense. Do they even have this one on their list?
---
Explosive legendary.
---
You could have just gone above and beyond and taken a mega dump your self onto a greenscreen.
---
That would have properly conveyed your sense of disgust with the trash this lesbian Mole Miner hands out.
---
VTU has a few weights in the Test Vault, and one of the Classrooms.
---
I really don't see how the purveyor is a way of slowing down player progression.  I'm sorry, but that's just illogical. It gives us a way of obtaining many more legendary items than we were able to before. Whether or not the chances of you getting something that you want are low, it's undeniable that are chances are much higher than before.
---
WHY NOT?
---
Awesome.  That thing is a beast.
---
Almost like the Underpants Gnomes in South Park!
---
Oh ok thanks for clearing things up for me btw is it possible to store a whole PA in storage?
---
Hang in there man, if anyone can relate to having complete and utter mother fucks as elected officials it‚Äôs those of us living in the US.
---
I got all excited when I got it, first awesome roll I‚Äôve gotten from her. It also gives me +1 Perception which is great since that‚Äôs my dump stat on this toon.
---
Could be we will get bows with Squirrel Rank in the Pioneer Scouts, most likely coming during Nuclear Winter DLC this summer. There has been perk cards seen during presentations for Exotic Weapons showing a Vault-boy with a bow.
---
I have one, and it‚Äôs brill!
---
Sounds like you deserve it for not doing something more productive with her time. Hopefully you only have limited custody.
---
I DON'T KNOW! LET'S CALM DOWN!
---
There there buddy. Why don't you run along and get rekt in survival mode with the big boys.
---
This is a God tier post
---
If you take the Cola Nut perk and have it equipped, and stock up on Nuka Cherry/Grape/Quantum etc, you can generally heal faster than you take damage.
---
My strategy is to take all three pylons and hang out stealthed on top of the shack drinking soda. It tends to work out pretty well when there are damage dealers that show up to help.
---
Yes you can store a whole set of PA just put all the pieces on a chassis and store it that way.
---
I start the event, I start up CS:GO and look for a competitive match, and then when warmup for that match is ending I start getting smacked around by a ghoul. Come on now...
---
Yeah this only work if you are eye level with the Wavy Waves image or above. Taking a picture below from in the pool won't work.
---
HOW ABOUT
---
NO
---
Nifty, thanks!
---
You get a new lease when you complete the quest. Unsure of others. I‚Äôm guessing there are a few for the scout questline too
---
ALRIGHT THEN!
---
Open up the engine compartment of your car and get a little of that dirt &amp; oil mixture that builds up on your engine, smear that onto the helmet. 
---
Or, for a cheap airbrush go to a hobby store and look for a Testors airbrush kit.
---
How are you playing F076 on a potato?
---
This. He's saved my life many times from spawning in and standing in front of enemies.
---
Does this work with the PA screen color? That tan is awful.
---
I made a similar post with a solution, even did the math in the comments, but nobody seems to care about logic here though...
---

I've noticed starvation and dehydration will reduce damage. Just figured this out last night and I'm 105, lol
---
Sometimes he appears in his underwear and if he appears when firing at things in the sky he can pop in and plummet to his death.  I think that's worth seeing.
---
Well just like the first person said, any time I join a world where my camp spot is already taken, and I go to find a new world, my machines are re set and I have to go through and list my items for sale again. 
---
Not saying this is what‚Äôs happening with you. If you claim you‚Äôre not doing it then the machines are just simply bugged. All I have to say is it does happen like that because it‚Äôs done it 2 times for me.
---
Because profits
---
Jesus man. What the hell
---
Im saying i would pay atom points for the paints. Just make the base armor then sell paints on top of it. Dont cop out with a reskin. Seems lazy
---
Can confirm, have spawned here post blackout.

Check this out, should have what you need.

I'm hardly socially comfortable, I just know when I'm on a game, and need to communicate, that I need to speak up, even with my issues. I have pretty severe social anxiety due to having asperger's. As for your reason, I totally get that. I used to run a bounty hunting crew, before I got sick, and we got quite a bit of business from gals that were being harassed by jackasses.
---
I am, if they're cheap. I want to open up a magazine bar in the future. I won't even have to laminate the magazines in case people spill booze on them.
---
Got one at the SBQ, keeping it. 1 I love dogs, 2 I have never seen another, 3 maybe someday Beth will add the dog companion, and Bam I'll be ready!
---
That would be awesome to have. We gotta have plenty of food to eat. Especially the radioactive scrambled eggs for breakfast every morning.
---
I want turrets with frickin laser beams attached to their foreheads
---
I love the sleepy ghouls flapping about like fish out of water, makes me chuckle. Plus the random legendaries from them is great too, plenty of scrip
---
Awesome üëè. I was just thinking about how I‚Äôd like to play with more ppl for events and stuff but right now finding players (especially compatible ones) is tough for me. I‚Äôd love to see this feature added.
---
This would be interesting if people weren't shitheads and would just spam it constantly over nothing.
---
Uh...power armor.....just sayin
---
That makes so much more sense after I see your answer
---
That would be an awesome idea.
---
It's easy to do that event solo if got the right tools and know how to prepare.
---
How exactly are they selling a way for it not to spoil?
---
i cannot relate with the aspbergers personally, but my sons father has it.  
---
I just dont think everyone was ready for this to be as social a game as it forces people to be at times.  This game is an acquired taste IMO.
---
They need to make it happen.
---
 Having this problem myself. Got a fix for it?
---
Wait, when people buy from the vending machines, some invisible figure goes and takes a small percentage?
---
That's really dumb. Where is the money going to? Who is taking it?
---
OMG yassss. This would lay waste to every enemy.
---
I like being the conduit during this event. Both my characters are very in your face melee but one hit from Ms impostor and they're dead so I do more good by sucking up some energy damage and hiding out at the little building. I try to shoot at the gutsys, and the impostor if she's visible, but avoid getting too involved so I can focus on keeping up those pylons. I hate the lag though, whenever I arrive it takes ages to show me if any pylons need picking up or not.
---
i am unsure, but i do know that all of the trash cans at the white springs count as "lunch boxes" for the perk Can Do
---
The blood raider skin looks really ugly. I'm glad that I have the original.
---
FINE!
---
Not to my knowledge, sounds like someone spreading negative rumors.
---
Asshole
---
The game is freaking awesome yes!!
---
You will have to be !ERROR! patient as !ERROR! all good things !ERROR! take a while.
---
That would be neat. Personally I'd want to add more interaction to the large map and have this be a SPECIAL-based check (like the PER check on that one body for that one quest). Like, let players with 7+ INT repair auto-docs that are located in various locations of the map. Gives incentive to revisit locations beyond looting and adds another small interesting layer of interaction.
---
LOL.
---
And he's got the "well fed" (I think) icon too.

Supa H4x0r Detected!

Quick, Someone call Todd "It Just Works" Howard!

This is why women can‚Äôt have nice things.
---
Like the horseman armor only having 1 skin regardless of the type of PA you put it on?
---
Thank you. My bad
---
Nope. You can earn a backpack mod that reduces spoilage rate.
---
LOL. Thanks for the clarification.
---
It's just a visual bug. Sell something and it'll reset.
---
(Sorry.  I saw everyone posting the same thing and not reading your replies and couldn't help myself :))

i keep 1 of each mag, but any spares i find i sell
---
Ummm...k?
---
There is no indication that Sentinel is available other than rumors, might have been found in the dev room on PC but that's not legit.
---
Have a plain 2 shot crossbow now need that extra explosive star
---
Just tore mine down because of this last night. It finally got so stuck I had to move camp and scrap the blueprint. So frustrating
---
Launch a nuke at Harper's Ferry. It has way more violet flux than cranberry bog, and you can farm the ghouls in the Burroughs for mass and fluids.
---
Whoever told you that lied there's a backpack mod you earn in game it is not bought
---
One has a nest in the mire by dyer chemicals.
---
‚ÄúHave to earn‚Äù not ‚Äúcan earn‚Äù. You need the quest backpack to craft it, and you cannot build/scrap to get mods. Those need to be earned too. It‚Äôs. Glamour, not actually a backpack.
---
ok
---
I'll climb anything hahA
---
How? It doesn‚Äôt show up in the trade screen,
---
Sees the reply gets annoyed, reads reply and laughs.
---
I have everything but Elder, so yeah gg
---
Now it should defo be slightly easier....just weird also
---
Found one on the bench at campfire tales event. Something lad.
---
GOOD!
---
Do you have any experience with blueprints at all? I build mine at a cliffside, one house at the floor surrounded by walls and a second floor connected to a small spot on the cliff, everything barely fits, took me hours just to get everything closed because of all of those big rocks, I am afraid that I can't place down that blueprint. Also not all parts are connected to each other.
---
I prefer "hood" players. Makes me feel young again
---
i need this in a puddle and im done
---
It needs a Van Hellsing style drum mag with rapid fire capability
---
you guys have never played the old brotherhood of steel twin sticks shooter for the ps2 i am guessing  it was actually a joke in that game mind you which means it's lore based but instead of getting raped by a ghoul the ghoul hired a prostitute and his penis skin came off inside her it was a pretty good joke with a awsome delivery you all might wanna go back and play that one
---
Isnt the east through the mire tho? I havent been round there so im not sure whats there! I heard the further east u go, the harder it is
---
My PC is fine for running it, but the recording just sucks. I probably didn‚Äôt set up OBS properly, especially given that like I said I downloaded it about halfway through the whole shebang.

üòÇ If only!

Any radzone, gouls and molerats drop.

I said I liked it lol, not love it

Wish I would have known that. I shot it will nearly 100 modified syringes lol.
---
Yes it would've been major beneficial with more prep time.
---
i wrote a longer description if you wanna read it go for it but it's actually just a twist on a real joke in the brotherhood of steel game for the ps2 lore folks lore get with the damn program you all aren't  seeming to be much fans of the series currently
---
Saw a great one at a camp I visited today: camper had med box on ground with a marquee arrow pointed to it and a sign (small letters plan) TAKE SOME, LEAVE SOME
---
I've definitely been having more issues with walls and roofs giving me intersect/floating errors when there is no such problem. 
---
Had to re-design half a camp around one spot 2 wall lengths above the ground where it wouldn't let me put a roof.
---
I personally have a full furnished, hotel-style house and I have about 15% camp budget remaining. ([Here's a pic during Fasnacht](https://imgur.com/hdi2WG1))  I have an interior garden, three guest rooms, a kitchen with a dining table and a crafting room.  Every room is fully furnished and decorated.  Literally everything anyone could need.  I keep the budget low by using no turrets, keeping the garden a modest size (I tend to live off 2 gourd soups and 4 corn soups during a usual 3-6 hour play session) and utilizing lights efficiently.  The brahmin pen really isn't worth having and takes up a huge portion of your budget.  (if you need brahmin milk for a recipe, go to Flatwoods and milk the 6 cows that live there.)  Turrets seem to ignore enemies half the time, so I find them to be similarly wasteful.  There's also no need for 3 large water purifiers, even if you use Speed Demon mutation.  I use one, and that's plenty for myself and my visitors.  It's always full of at least 3 waters when I come back home.
---
I do use 2 ranks of Dromedary perk and Herbivore mutation, so I guess I'm getting a bit more mileage out of my soups.
---
Bought one from one of the watoga vendors a while back.
---
Sledgehammers can do this as well lol
---
Has anyone noticed a glitch where the carry weight in the excavator pa fluctuates? As though the game ignores the excavator +100 bonus.
---
I get this one a lot. Nominally my carry weight should be 445 but at least 50% of the time I log in the server has my carry weight as 335 which is frustrating as hell as it often leaves me over encumbered.
---
Definitely. Usually my lucky days will be 20 or so. Today I got over 100 üò≠.
---
I had the same problem at least twice. Only noticed it when I went to fast travel back to camp and noticed my icon wasn't on. Thinking something destroyed my generator or something but no, everything was intacked and connected but all my items were not listed.
---
So there is a thing that I can get via a quest that slows down food spoilage rate?
---
Apart from the blatantly obvious issue of there not being dedicated servers for everyone.
---
Tank Rifle is for rifles
---
Love it. You can pump shots into the SBQ while the minion scorched rap on you doing little damage to you.
---
me sad
---
The backpack quest and then you earn enough scout badge token things to buy the refrigerated mod from the vendor.
---
Aha!   Thank you all, I will be on the lookout for calibrated shocks plans!
---
Ya wish high player volume servers would open
---
fshewww!! fshewww!
---
portable power is kind of useless. when wearing PA everything weighs 0 pounds. and if it is on a chassis it only weighs 10
---
Try Survival.
---
10mm pistol or machine gun out the side of the Corvega.
---
Oh, you're finally awake
---
No it would be the most likely way to get decent items, you just have to put up with a lot of deal items
---
Thank you, that‚Äôs very useful! üëçüèª
---
I was like that until player vending came around. From levels 15 to 198, I couldn't sprint or fast travel. It's honestly game changing to be able to do it though. It should be a priority to ditch all that extra weight. I would say get rid of the efficiency perks (ghoulish, first aid, pharmacist) if you can't get yourself to outright toss/sell all of the spare supplies.
---
You have to use the camera and hover over the generator in your camp until it says generator in the top right, if it doesn't work then move your generator slightly
---
You will find people most often in popular places (whitesprings) or during big events. Other than that, people tend to stick to themselves for the most part
---
the AWOL Armaments event is pretty helpful, pops up often and always has several players jump on it - it's hard because there are loads of Mr Gutsies, so you're guaranteed to have people needing reviving.
---
Nope. PS4.
---
It would be totally random, that way you get to meet new neighbors each time you play
---
just like that of a real wasteland, to find companions you must seek them out
---
&gt;!unlike a real wasteland, you can wear fancy suits and outfits and not have to worry about getting robbed as often!&lt;
---
not particularly unique but anytime you have that feeling that makes you want to party after taking down a big monster you've done something fun in the game at least
---
I kill and die in it every day, "buddy", can you say the same?
---
Yeah, but I use chems rarely.
---
Its possible I took me a few times to find the same thing... now I find the cameras EVERYWHERE and can‚Äôt sell, drop or put them in a box for someone else!
---
/r/market76 might be able to help you out
---
I took a picture of a small generator I built in my CAMP and it worked.
---
Thanks so much
---
It is certainly legendary.  Perhaps even legacy.
---
The current theory is that there's a "seed" on each character/server that tilts the RNG. I don't know if it's true, but if you get a couple of similar items it might be worth server hopping and trying again. 
---
Last night I got 3 guns in a row that all had bonus bashing damage. Swapped servers and 2 out of the next 3 guns were bloody.
---
My computer is fine for running it, just the recording sucked. I probably didn‚Äôt set up OBS properly.
---
We also need the cancan in-game
---
That‚Äôs a good one.
---
That‚Äôs kind of what I figured. It felt REALLY cool in the moment but I was sure it wasn‚Äôt that unique. It did make me appreciate the game more, even if it happened due to some bugs coming together well.
---
I still cant turn in technical data...when im in front of the‚Äùmailbox‚Äù nothing happens....please help! Im level 149,done it all but this not work????
---
Hey you, you‚Äôre finally awake. You were trying to cross the border right? Walked right into that Imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there.
---
Exactly! That where I am too. I'd much rather help other players out. B.S with them. Complete events and missions together. Kick them down stimpaks, radaway, mutation serum etc...
---
1st guy: I want to unlock the automatic mod for that weapon.
---
 2nd guy: I have know that mod. You want me to put that mod on for you?
---
1st guy: yes, that would be awesome, thanks.
---
Because I feel really good when they genuinely appreciate it and show that by saying thank you. 
---
And being like that is so much more fun and fulfilling than the following example showing the mentality and way of playing of griefers....
---
I love to destroy someones camp for no reason except to try to ruin someones day or start a PVP with one person who's playing by themselves and I secretly have 3 or 4 friends hiding, just waiting for him to fight back and even if he doesnt want to fight, I'm going to taunt and harass him repeatedly until he reacts and fights back. But we destroy him in a 5 vs 1 and think it's funny, because 5 of us beat one guy. We are badasses! But here's the thing, if that guy somehow wins and kills all 5 of us. I'm going to find his camp and destroy it everytime he's logged into the game and away from his camp. 
---
Why do people act, play  and think like this?^^
---
No thank you to them. 
---
I've come back to my camp being totally destroyed. After the 3rd time I almost moved my camp. Then I thought to myself, screw it, I'm not giving them what they want. I honestly didn't know why someone was doing it and therefore couldn't know what they wanted. But I just assumed they wanted my camp location. They can server hope and leave me alone. But I just got the materials and fixed my camp and said I'm gonna just fix it everytime the destroy it no matter how many times they do it. It hasnt happened again for a little while. But I'll be much happier when they remove the ability to damage other players camps without being provoked.
---
Tldr lol. Sorry, just kept typing. 
---
Have a good one brother.
---
A sweatroll.  LMFAO  The grossest confection in existence.
---
"Now with extra body odor!"
---
Somehow, someone would find a way to abuse it.
---
You could hire someone to build you a camp.
---
One of the requirements is to get 4 of 10(ish) pioneer scout badges, one badge requires you to revive another player
---
Needs to be a perk card or med that makes the bodies glow after you kill them
---
Cranberry bog is a pain in my ass.
---
Yes those are the little things that are missing. So many skelotens and random corpses told a story, i didnt see much of that in 76, but i was probably too busy micromanaging every other aspect of the game to fully enjoy it
---
If you're on xbox I'll trade you a BE double barrel for it.
---
i have re logged for days now with multiple characters and get the same results
---
Joining,  ill gear up and head down
---
Unfortunately they only want us to play 1.5 times per day if we want to gamble on good weapons. My guess is someone on their dev teams thought more than an hour per day spent in their game is not healthy for family life.
---
There good but anti armor anything doesn't work on energy weapons and furious caps at 30%
---
Those tax dollars are funding extravagant lifestyles of elected officials and coal executives while WV is left to rot.
---
Welcome to West Virginia Motherfucker!  This is the most realistic game ever developed.
---
Should camps have everything? I don't think so. 
---
The Whitesprings fountain is cool. If every camp had one, it wouldn't be nearly as special, and it would trivialize an already very forgiving system.
---
What's even worse is the census bot ( I've named him Greg) has to delete his creativity subroutines to do the count. 
---
Very typical of capitalism to force a sentient being to destroy their own creativity and it's very sad. 
---
RIP Greg

Power armor
---
Then every time you log in there would be a ‚Äúconflicting‚Äù cabin as it would already be in use. As a shopping district with limited cabins it‚Äôd be busy every server. Meaning you can either spend half an hour hoping you find a world without an occupied cabin, or you can pay for a cabin if you‚Äôre lucky enough to find one and then never use it again. Not possible without dedicated servers where the players and world is set in place. Plus you‚Äôd just get players buying the permit and then never giving it up again. Just a terrible idea in general
---
Yeah if you don't have any addictions you don't get any damage bonus. With addictions you get 10% damage per addiction, up to 50%. It's about twice as good as two shot, and about the same as bloodied at 40% health. If you negate the addictions with chems you still get the bonus without any negative effects other than the cost of chems. There are three chems that stack (so they can be negated all at once), plus alcohol, so you can easily do 4 addictions at once with zero negative effects.
---
So because we don't understand or didn't think your translation of a bad joke from one game of the series we're not true fans or whatever label you wanna put.
---
Ok.
---
I also have little baggies full of goodies out in front of my vendors. if Ihave  just done a cranberry run I start with one cranberry pie and then throw in any 38 miny nukes missiles and often the grenades for the launcher as well that I might have in my inventory sometimes 10 mm.
---
:(
---
I still don‚Äôt understand the point of that
---
Have you left the server and game, are reloaded to see if that helps?
---
Actually the glowing ghouls underground don't drop those, there's no radiation down there. At least that's my experience. They have to die in radiated atmosphere to drop those. So either the ones above ground (HF sometimes don't have many of them, only scorched and super mutants), or farm for those in WS and save the mass and fluids for later use (that's what I do).
---
Got it to work I had to take a weird  angle for it to work thanks for the help
---
Oh didn‚Äôt realize they nerfed caps in pvp that hard-they should at least be on par in my opinion
---
2 from footlockers both. One at tadpole camp, not sure about other.
---
Sweet, no problem.
---
Only time I get to Sprint is in the excavator power armor 440 weight limit for me
---
It's cool that they put nukashine bottles at all the teleport locations
---
No.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs the same workaround I found, it is a hassle
---
I've had all 3 before it's a real pain almost constantly defending them.
---
My wife has this same issue when she logged in today.  No CAMP taken Gina another server, and she has just setup her sales yesterday after moving her CAMP (she made several sales last night after while doing dailies and events).  This is the first time it happened to her, so hopefully it doesn't the next time she logs in.
---
Yea ended up with alot of poisoner
---
I'm not strong in economics but a cap sink keeps prices low as overall everyone will have less caps. Most games implement them.
---
While we're at it, we should get a supressor for that bowie knife too.
---
Get good I level up 5 times a day on my high level character if I play as him
---
It‚Äôs fine saying ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt it be cool if‚Äù, but you need to think of how it would actually be implemented.
---
Who the hell is downvoting fact?
---
...so gamma gun does have a use after all.....who knew

Very nice, especially from a boss, they usually drop tire irons and rolling pins, which is why fewer and fewer people drop nuke in fissure site now.

People?

This morning, I got a 1\* Hunter's Baton from a random Legendary near Berkeley Springs.  Scrapped it.  Went to buy a 2\* item.  Got a 2\* Hunter's Baton.
---
No one but Bethesda knows the exact mechanism, but I am convinced that the "Legendary server" is a lazy thing, and if the client fails to hear back from it when a Legendary is requested, the game falls back on what it did the previous time, either recycling the same prefix or the same weapon type.  I'm highly skeptical that the system is as RNG as it is claimed because getting a run of the same prefix or item is just too common.
---
I'm having trouble believing you.

Why are you posting this when you aren‚Äôt even in game ?

The car repair shop north of the gorge junkyard workshop. Comes with a power armor crafting station plus many sweet loots(stims and good junk). forget the name and I'm at work right now.

Going rifles to inherently makes you have weight issues. My damn handmades weigh 20lbs a piece. Add some serious vending and scrip pieces for the next day and I am over all the time.
---
All in all I enjoy helping others.
---
To the sleevebags who attacks one person and have two or more people on them, you are not a real man or woman. You are a scared piece of (censored word) who deserves to know pain and suffering when you do that crap. üò°
---
When I find someone doing that to other players or when it's done to low level ones who don't know much, I destroy them and enjoy it alot. I take all the stuff they drop and give it to the new player once we get to a stash box for them. üòá You do u justice to the guy you attack and I destroy you before I give your stuff to them.
---
I would love to know the reasons behind their choice of not letting us trade them..... I see so many people having a real hard time finding the tourist, that it seems this would make things easier.
---
Or is it the need of a camera to earn free atoms that made the decide not to let us help each other out
---
Not explosive tesla

Wow man, that‚Äôs really something love seeing people splicing the things they love.. ü§ì

That terminal could start a quest to repair the autodoc, and when you finish repairing it you are capable of building one

I used to be broke AF all the time until I hit lvl 150 or so.  At that point I'd bought or found all the plans I wanted and had very little to spend caps on, save the odd, high quality legendary piece that someone sold away.
---
At that point, making 1400 caps a day selling chems just added up, and I started buying mutation serum recipes.  I make a bunch, put them in the machine for 499 caps and sell at least a handful a day.  I was down to 2000 caps after buying a crazy good Gatling Laser from someone's machine, and I'm back up to 10k a couple days later.
---
It gets much, much easier to make money when you get a good idea of the weapons, armor and clothing items that are very popular, and sell them for modest prices to ensure that they don't clog up your machine(s) for more than a couple days.  I do good business selling single-star max level legendary weapons with quad, instigating, bloodied, vampire or 2-shot effects for 499 caps each.  I like farming legendary gear, so I'm opting for the "volume" approach to retail.  Sell it cheaply and quickly to make room for new stuff.
---
This somewhat overlaps with what a lot of people are saying, but what Bethesda needs to do is look at the excellent crossbows of the commonwealth mod, which is likely the reason 76 has crossbows to begin with, and take inspiration from all of the cool attachments those had. There was nothing quite as satisfying in fallout 4 as melting enemies with a crossbow that would flash is bolts into plasma as they were released.
---
I've been finding a lot more camp plans in containers since the last update.
---
A tse acts like a ballistic two shot. It does not fire electric arcs.
---
That is so cool
---
I have one. Helmet and Uniform. Can you do 10,000 caps?
---
Ultracite would be pretty badass too.
---
I can‚Äôt, I just reached 8,000 after grinding for days lol
---
It's not great.
---
What works for me is to use Enforcer + Shotgun (you can pick whatever crippling perk is best for you) and blast it until it slows down.  Then, I finish it off with a Gatling Gun.
---
Before, I used to rely on a Lever Action Rifle and it took *forever* to bring one down.
---
I like the faking idea .. lure in some females .. drag em back to my cave
---
At least, at the very least I wish they'd make flares more visible even if they don't go all out and make events or other things tied to em, when I was a lower level I did use the flare for this exact reason and the times I did it it did work, players near me showed up to help .. but since then I've yet to see it
---
&gt; When I finally get on the mic and scream
---
That‚Äôs the definition of impressive work!
---
Center the blast zone over the turtle at the top of the map I farm around 500 everytime I do
---
Have 4 pieces of weapon weight reducing armour my rifles weigh less than 2lbs
---
Just seen and picked one up from the prison a few days ago
---
I don't play survival so not really worried about it.
---
However you do bring up a good point.
---
I mean we literally have to hop inside of an auto doc to be scanned when we launch nukes, why cant that also pick up a disease and sure it, and for some atoms we can build one in our camp or make it as part of the rewards for the end game medical badges
---
Lol more of an embellishment. I don't actually scream...most of the times it happens.
---
There should be some over at the penitentiary in the Toxic Valley region. Actually, like, a lot of them. I think I left with like 20 my first time in there.
---
Also collect the can chimes while you're there, extra lead and steel.
---
Sorry I had to leave, my mom called me for dinner
---
(PC) I have frog, I have jar, how to get frog in Jar ?
---
I had the legendary robot glitch after a nuke, hundreds of legendary robots carrying hundreds of crap legendary like instigating mrhandy saw, or bloody pipes. Or anti-armor walking cane.
---
No go to the prison mid section of map north of the vault .. there is a ton .. I still wear one .. 
---
AND IT'S NOT A SLAVE COLLAR!!! IT'S A PRISONER COLLAR I BELONG TO NO ONE SIR/MADAM!!!
---
Not really, yesterday I got about 4/5 3* and a whole bunch of 2* from a nuked whitesprings
---
You brain good.
---
Me like.
---
It doesn't need to be done with a flare but doing it with a flare is so much cooler.
---
Oh actually to build onto that idea, the quest to try to repair it could involve us finding the manual and schematics for it. Afterwards we could utilize it whenever in the area as a free medical service, like how you can use the Enclave's Showers whenever you want.
---
Okay i'll do 8,000 then, your suffering is over young one. Sgt Peterson 25 on xbox, I'm online right now.
---
BOS sucked. 
---
Also I started this out on your side because I got the reference but after reading this comment you can fuck right off, talking about snowflake culture you edgy special little man
---
Rambarrows!
---
You my friend, are a GODSEND
---
I‚Äôve gotten more 3 stars than I normally did, nothing useful mind you. I‚Äôve seen some other posts claiming the same. I‚Äôm thinking there‚Äôs probably no change to the drop rate and some people are just getting good strings of rng while others are getting bad.
---
This post need way more credit! Fantastic!
---
Quite the opposite, I'm finding way more than usual. Maybe they're just slowing shifting the rates around so each area gives a roughly equal benefit instead of having a couple prime farming locations
---
I got 5 legendary Weapons/Armor today just wandering around.
---
Ok go ahead idc. The bog is where you need to be at 6 gouls is worth 1 scorchbeast at level 80 ya gouls are easy to kill but you hit whitesprings once and your done for an or so
---
The key is to build a way that you'll need minimal turrets, floating the base if you have to, I was able to build a three story mansion that perfectly overlooks the fissure prime nuke site with no turrets and I'm exactly at limit but you can do alot with some intelligent design! *where my F04 master builders at?* 
---
Heres a tour of my camp if you wanna see what I mean 
---
https://youtu.be/KdQL5pXXevY
---
They're moderately good with a sneak build.
---
I think they'd be even better if they could apply effects with different arrow types.
---
I am level 167 and I play a ridiculous amount of hours every day and only level up maybe once a day if that. 2 if I am really lucky.
---
 I also have a hard time believing the above poster.
---
Anybody that uses phrases like "get gud"  don't really rank high in my believable charts anyway.
---
There‚Äôs definitely still some there, but I think they were too busy scrambling to make the game semi-playable before they could add a bunch more of those kinds of extra enjoyables.
---
oh that's by the thing .. I win
---
We'll meet at Vault 76
---
My theory has been that the seed for the RNG comes from the time. That's why you seem to get bunches of similar effects in a row.
---
Not much of a sneak person.
---
And paint.
---
Alright. Joining right now
---
My experience is similar.  I'm Level 199 and it's gotten to where I'm basically leveling every other day, although I'm sitting on a mountain of unspent points because I honestly have no idea what to spend them on.  The diminishing returns are very real, since the enemies top out well below Lv. 200.
---
I can't imagine what it must be like for the odd Lv. 600s I see from time to time.
---
In your experience, how many times out of 10 does the "hunting bugs" ending happen instead of the Wendigo ending?
---
In mine 9 out of 10 is the "kindling gathering" ...... I would hope that the level 234 players that show up didn't need instructions and guidance.
---
When everyone there works together the event is easy. ...
---
Haha. Thank you!!
---
Repetition is a good thing in moderation.
---
Serves no purpose though. The game already has visual triggers built into it, it just needs the trigger to show in the HUD.
---
Of course, they could show a tracking number next to each item (stays visible) of how many players in the event boundary.
---
Seen loads on my normal run. Lot cheaper than the purveyor, all I need to do is clean my knife ‚ò∫
---
To combat inflation.  It‚Äôs the primary purpose of taxes.  It is an attempt to maintain a stable economy.  Otherwise, resources and caps would become significantly more plentiful over time, which would devalue basic resources and inflate the values of top-tier items.
---
Ok, I made a kind of "Jack of all Trades" based on my build [here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7c235de&amp;d=sf2s01sb1pd1pk1pl1pp1pg0ph0pa0eu0c71ir1ic2a71an2ar1ao0a12a01la2lu1lt2ld1l71l11ej0p80&amp;w=&amp;n=Bloodied%20crit%20build&amp;m=31efc5), and very similar to yours (yes, micromanagement it's tedious and there is a mod in Nexus that allows to swich perk cards profiles very fast, but i dont have it yet and don't want to open Pipboy every min to change something)
---
* I recomend to get you irradiated until get 20% HP
---
* I love *carnivore* mutation, you can eat whatever kind of meat you want without diseasing. Hervibore can do instead. *Adrenal reaction*, *Marsupial* and *Speed Demon* are a must
---
* In STR, at least Bandolier and Barbarian are a must, I choose traveling pharmacy because stimpacks and diluted radaways can weight A LOT
---
* In PER, I added Commando and lockpick perks because i dont want to waste much time opening pipboy, but you can manage and improve dmg with one type of rifle only. Also there are a lot of picklocks out there
---
* I only put 2 points in END because you are supossed to oneshot everything, or be in places that enemies cant reach. Radicool is another must, and the other‚Ä¶ you can put whatever X)
---
* In AGI, the most important are Born Survivor and Evasive (and Dodgy of course). You can add others that better fits your playstyle
---
* INT, dont understimate Nerd Rage, nice boost for low health players, and Gunsmith its also a must
---
* LUCK.. well, each perk card is very important, but with mutations, Starched genes its the most.
---
* CHAR... I like the lone wanderer playstyle, so I usually get that card. You may swap it with Tenderizer everytime you go shopping
---
And i think that's all, the best build is the one you feel more comfortable :)
---
it can. My friend barricaded the door to the Uranium Fever area with harpoons
---
That a chance you have to take. Flares could definitely attract the wrong kind of attention!
---
It seems like you need a specialized build for it. I have a couple of things for it - an explosive weapon can help cripple the rotors, which makes it stop moving around. A strong anti-armor weapon can also just tick it down - I managed to take one down earlier with a 1* AA combat rifle. A targeting missile launcher is also extremely effective, since unlike a scorchbeast it won't be flying in a ten billion mile radius around you so you're not likely to be hitting it outside your damage range
---
Time to drink all my Nukashine!
---
It can be done.
---
It's just really kinda wonky.
---
I average about 2 levels if I try and I'm over level 250
---
Frustrating ..... I'm just having a bout of bad luck .... Purveyor gave me nothing but Scrip worthy crap, and I haven't been able to even find anything worthy of selling in my vending machine since.
---
I've bought most of the few bobbleheads I'd never used for that atom task for using all 20 of them. 
---
I was doing the same for magazines until I found out they don't count for the tasks if you buy them.
---
Yes, and the end result would be the same.  Every Legendary spawned in a certain time frame has certain things in common.  Could be an ever-shifting thing too.  Like, in this 5 minute interval, it's all Bloodied.  In the next, it's all Junkies, etc.
---
I have one as well.
---
Can't imagine fighting anything outside of the forest with it, though.
---
Great so it‚Äôs another of my horrible personal glitch‚Äôs.. and here I thought they were reworking the Death power suit skin and waited on buying the raider one and might miss out now..
---
If you're not enjoying everything we've gotten in the past few months, this probably just isn't the game for you
---
Everything comes with risks in life.
---
This exactly. I collect all the mass and fluid at WS and save them. When I get the flux elsewhere I know I have other ingredients ready.
---
How is your build not finished in the 200s? I'm like 145 and have 15 unused level ups.
---
The XP is fine.
---
Also the overseers journey - the personal holotapes. This gave me solid feels.
---
Once again get good if I‚Äôm xp grinding easy 5 times a day if I‚Äôm on a team well rested with cranberry pie. Whitesprings, west tek, bog has 3 or 4 queens in it and a deathclaw, farm schorchbeasts rinse and repeat it‚Äôs easy af
---
yeah shoot the parts sticking out to make it stop moving then throw grenades in the air and vats shoot them when they're high enough .. or wait to some OP player shows up with some ridiculous gatling/anti air weapon
---
Glowing Resin, available from some trees. I think it only takes that and some wood to make.
---
Harpers is my favorite, go into the burrows collect stuff to stabilize the flux, then come above ground collect flux violet and crimson got the the chem table next to the vendor and make flux sell ionized meat to vendor. I usually have more raw flux then material to stabilize so sell it as well.
---
Some guy on YouTube just had 23 purchases using various characters in their game. Didn't come away with anything useful. The purveyor seems to have a special kind of RNG üòÜ
---
I cannot possibly thank you enough :)
---
Is it floating?!
---
Sorry you lost me at "get good".
---
 Everything past that just seems like jumbled D baggery.
---
LOL
---
I‚Äôm hoping a larger emphasis on faction conflicts comes in soon, then we can make our own fun. Right now, there‚Äôs only so much you can do.
---
It serves the purpose of being a more satisfying less passive mechanic. You don't think the idea of shooting up a flare sounds awesome? Also it could be used in non event specific situations, so it would be less limited.
---
So, theres a lot more problems than I realized.  But I can definitely see low level bosses being one.  It's pretty rare I even get to find the boss because I encounter so many bugs before I get there. (including no map marker for boss)
---
I grinded the starting quests in flatwoods to get it many months ago. Don't wear it much anymore, just glad it could make someone happy. Enjoy.
---
Ohhhh. Ok that makes sense. Thought it was a normal item that you can find, I can get glowing resin easy enough. Thank you!
---
Server hop should fix that
---
Just because you can have a build done doesnt mean the xp is fine. That's not even an arguement. I'm trying to respec dude. Shouldn't have to create a new character that doesnt know any of the plans my 1st guy does just to start using a different gun.
---
comes from glowing resin the yellow sap on trees its everywhere
---
I used to wear one all the time, but I didn't like how the constantly blinking red light looked in Photomode.
---
I really wish there were more neckwear options, to be honest.
---
Being *edit*
---
OK thanks.
---
I hear it just starts working again after a period of time. I hope it does.
---
I love the irony of getting power armor replica from China
---
If you can get to it when it's hovering around in circles, it's fairly easy to shoot the engines out.
---
Appalachia was fine without you free states. The Enclave was nice and quiet.
---
I found four 3* weapons at a train station merchant lol. No idea who sold four lvl 45-50 3* but for less than 500 caps I bought them all. Easy scrap.
---
I sell the duplicates I got too. I finally bought the last bobblehead I needed for my collection though from some guy's machine. Some people have bought my duplicates also.
---
I just intentionally miss when I swing at them and then when they hit me back I kill them and blow the SHIT out of their base.
---
It took someone 9 hours to comment this. I'm disappointed in this subreddit
---
Maybe the gamma gun?
---
\*slowly raises hand while double checking karma\*
---
yeah ofc we do but now I'm goin to hell cause of bad karmaz
---
Same looking for responders fireman set don‚Äôt have caps to trade but have good weapons and armour to trade
---
Fuck karma
---
Maybe they'll show the Nuclear Winter trailer at E3, and announce it's ready to play that night as a mic drop. Similar to what they did with Fallout Shelter.
---
I always take at least 2 pylons.  If I can grab them while staying hidden, Healing Factor and Grounded mutations do a good job of keeping the damage ticks very small.  Once I sneak on top of the shack I swap in First Aid, Field Surgeon and Chem Fiend perks, then unload a dozen or so rounds into the Impostor for loot credit.  At that point I slowly apply stims as needed, maybe top off my food and water, and pick off Gutsies from the roof.  95% of the people in the event get tunnel vision on the Impostor and ignore everything else, so I just get in at least 15% damage on the boss and focus on keeping the event running smoothly.
---
I'd rather just take it upon myself to keep the show running smoothly instead of waiting on someone else to take the reins.  I seem to get a lot of actual 3-star gear from the Impostor, got a one star wood armor piece only once out of dozens of runs, so maybe there's a hidden benefit to actually sacrificing your resources during the event.
---
The first time I drank nuka shine, I woke up in a trailer park, inside of a trailer, in front of a TV with a bunch of beer bottles around me.
---
Doubt it will be that night but it would be nice.
---
name calling and a curse!!
---
this vendor should be immune to damage though I agree
---
*Scorchbeast shows up* What in Oblivion is that?!!!! *500 scorched spawn in*
---
Never had so much fun searching through people‚Äôs left overs
---
*gasp*
---
 YEAH!!!! raiders fo life!!!! ima go take some drugs
---
Stay tuned to Yong yea. I'll see you guys next time. Yong ouuuuut.
---
Head on over to survival mode.........  if you dare. You can destroy all the camps you want or are able to at least.
---
I also noticed this, and a quick search brought me to your thread. I got a bloodied explosive laser rifle out of a trade. It is the most bad ass Gun I have ever had, but the condition bar just eats away.
---
Must be taking about tse tesla or flamer
---
I play survival mode daily.  CAMPs are indestructible there as well, last I checked.
---
Stay tuned to Yong Yea. Yong ouuuuut.
---
This very funny
---
The helmet is a lot more narrow than the official model maybe that's whats making it look off?
---
No, and screw people like you lol.
---
1 - Make a CAMP on the farthest side of the map
---
2- Fill your vending machines with nothing but easily craftable crap to trick everyone into thinking it's full of good shit
---
3 - Wait and profit
---
Why?  
---
Can you not see the charge of the core?
---
I sell mine 1 cap per charge. So if it‚Äôs at 25 I charge 25. I know that‚Äôs a bit much, but I‚Äôm still trying to figure the best way to price things.
---
I could understand that if there wasn't a fucking limit on the caps. I can't sell anymore shit caus im maxed out at 25k
---
Right back atcha, buddy :)
---
Lol hope so.
---
I‚Äôm actually seeing the opposite. I‚Äôve gotten more.
---
[deleted]
---
Yes! It‚Äôs bad enough he drops dead on his own at any given moment!
---
So heres how you place a 3/4 down slant wall on a 2 tall slanted roof: build your regular walls, lay flat ceiling (roof), add 3/4 walls, remove flat ceiling, add first layer of slant ceiling on walls, add flat ceiling to upper ceiling layer in middle, place flat to angle ceiling next to it, fill up second layer with slant ceiling, set angled walls on end that wouldnt snap before on the wall, once walls are built you can now replace the flat and flat to angled ceiling piece, hope that itll let you or you start over.
---
That is currently how you complete a 2 level angled ceiling with walls that arent square. It‚Äôs a nightmare, and those steps are accurate.
---
I didn't follow that game .. but if they make it a tad bit less tedious and add in some repeatable end game content, a respec mechanic, more skins, instanced world loot and a more friendly multiplayer environment they will def. RETAIN more players ... as it is now .. ppl get excited ppl play it alot ppl get aggravated ppl leave .. most ppl don't hate all repi(tit)ion just repeated aggravating tedious annoying overly dramatic non ending feels like wasting time wanting to do other more fun shit using other fun mechanics shit ..
---
yeah I guess in conclusion they can we just gotta hope they do
---
ps.. like for instance .. the burrows instead of a one time quest is shoulda been like an MMO dungeon once a day or if you pay enough caps you go outside you use some UI option you 'reset' it all the shit respawns the quest gets removed has to be redone again and each 24 hour cycle you get double XP for doing it etc.
---
Probably because you're not a dog.
---
Wastes a perk point.
---
‚ÄúYou guys aren‚Äôt real fans if you don‚Äôt get my crappy joke.‚Äù
---
My build is made to get xp. Full unyielding, high int, inspirational with sleep and cran relish.  I don't even know how much aluminum it would take to get this high with vertibots. In the time that it would take to source that much aluminum you could just kill shit and get more xp.   I do super mutants for the steel and make bullets, got a pretty good system.
---
I've been getting very good drops since. Got a setinal assassin's chest a patch too late
---
Harpoons only show for me attached to enemies
---
That's just weird. I could swear it popped up for me when it counted, because anytime I take a picture without a name of what I'm shooting it never counts.
---
Turns out we're arming the mole miners as they prepare for war.
---
You may need to land the killing blow on the squatch for it to count.
---
A couple high powered sniper shots to one of the flaming jet things usually slows it down, but now I just buy them any time I see them. Just picked up 20 for 100 caps each.
---
Yeah you cannot and everything is just ridiculously priced now you go through 25 of the 500 core in like a second.  Why even sell used cores thats messed up.
---
Watch Bethesda put a holotape next to her that's just her mumbling for 2 minutes.
---
Yeah I thought so and I thought I did the second time. Guess not then. Try again I guess üòÇ
---
Yeah I killed a sheepsquatch too and didn't complete the challenge either. This one spawned at my base.
---
That would be cool, but i doubt Varric would tell them the story of how to make her.
---
No **** off
---
Even if your robot abominations can‚Äôt leave your camp let me make a murder bot instead of turrets. Love it.
---
Lol no, fuck you.
---
You think Fallout 76 has anywhere NEAR the same number of players as Fortnite? Or World of Warcraft? Or Apex? Or Elder Scrolls Online?
---
But I'll humor you. Ordinarily it's very difficult to find the numbers unless the developer publishes the numbers.
---
But you can currently find the numbers on PS4, and there's a website dedicated to it (So take these numbers and multiply by 3 if you want to average out for Xbox and PC too):
---
http://gamstat.com/
---
Fallout 76 isn't even in the top 450 games, at roughly 2 million players. Apex Legends has 26,400,000 players in comparison. Grand Theft Auto V has 119,000,000. Elder Scrolls Online has 4,500,000 (Although that one is a bit of an anomaly and is played by way more people on PC). Even Fallout Shelter and Fallout 3 have had way more than it.
---
That be a very good idea just to have them defend your camp. Be a good tool in survival
---
Damn. I know I've done it before. Ill try again later and see how it goes. Hope it's not bugged lol. Sick of missing out on atoms ever since the camera dropped (well and when we had the camera challenges and no camera)
---
I agree, I think fallout has already come a long way since launch to right the wrongs so yeah, definitely pulling a no man‚Äôs sky
---
WTF do you need to level up for if you're already over 200? I'm level 180 something and I'm sitting on like a dozen unused perk points because I don't have anything to do with them at this point.
---
That said, if you want to crank up your rate of level ups, stack a cranberry relish on top of that well rested buff, join a team, and have someone share level 3 inspiration for an extra 15%.
---
Are you getting the killing blow?
---
I usually take a look around the map at the visible players and their levels before I start.   If you see a fair number of high level players (maybe 5-6?) you can usually count on them to jump in.   If your server is mostly low levels or not many visible players, you should wait.
---
Just go to survival mode where you‚Äôre free to get griefed back ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I thought I did the second time I did it. Guess not. I'll keep trying anyway!
---
i thought the stealth blade mod got taken out  after fo4
---
What I love is that it is located near the edge of the border.
---
I play survival every day, but CAMPs are indestructible  there as well,  but the turrets are hostile and indestructible.
---
The dead don‚Äôt need a desk fan.
---
Someone gave me one of those rifles! The scope is nice but it weighs 16 lbs :(
---
Ah... ok, thanks...
---
Turtle? Do you mean the alligator at Wavy Willard's?
---
Same here, also found more plans (mostly grenade types) from killing super mutants
---
Thank you very much will look for you, hopefully be on in a bit.
---
Why can‚Äôt I see the comments
---
How much do you get for a 68 super mutant warlord? 
---
If you really want to level up you need to play bloodied with unyielding armor.  It's going to take much longer with any other style.
---
Stopped reading at "pacifist  in survival mode". This game is soft enough as is, if you kill the non-combatant you should at least get the watered down, measly amount of caps for it.
---
I have a mike. I asked someone if they would kindly jump to their death a few times for me. Luckily she had a cliff CAMP.
---
I unlocked almost all mods for radium (currenly can craft 51 mod) except suppressor mod. During last week I broke more then hundred guns without luck, holy shit... Still no suppressor
---
Issue then becomes having a friend in pacifist and duping caps. I've though about it and there's not many ways they can adjust the caps(other than just receiving/losing more) without it being exploited.
---
I can't either. It's weird.
---
Sykokity
---
I swear they said something about factions where in the works later.
---
Camp on an acid node, and then take a spin through lucky hole mine for lead ore. Before long you'll have more lead scrap than you know what to do with.

Feel free to join/invite if you see me on
---
Grab some resin on the trees outside the Whitespring fences, across the road and to the right as you leave the train station. Follow the woods around to the right to find more.
---
No you have to level up twice more rebuying th perks do you can have a 3 star with animation and one with out! Don‚Äôt you feel like you accomplished so much!
---
Should have kept reading, cause I stated just that. lol
---
OP knows. I choose to ignore jokes that are clearly for men, as I am not one. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
üòâ
---
You lot better be drunk back there
---
Yeah, I'm honestly just struggling to find a good solution, this was the best way I could think of. You pointing out that simple exploit though, shows just how hard of a job beth really has at implementing a functional survival reward system.
---
If it truly is a battle royal or TDM, I'd honestly hope they just remove vats entirely for it. The games PvP could strongly benefit from that
---
What do you mean by animated this is the first I'm hearing of them
---
üíñ
---
Go to soft serve instead
---
I have a level 3 hard bargain non animated. Also have a level two animated hard bargain and a level one non animated hard bargain.
---
 The game won't let me level up my animated one to a level 3 because I already have a level 3 hard bargain.
---
Unless I am missing something or doing something completely wrong
---
I do too
---
Its an extra option to close the game after it closes the world. It happens fast but ya he is leaving the world first. I use it all the time to reset ram. Helps alot in big open world games. Sometimes games just keeps taking more ram instead of unloading an area and loading up new.
---
Brill, I love that word haha
---
People group up in discord servers and used to farm vertibots on double xp weekend. 300-400 levels in one weekend. I don't trust people with very high levels anymore
---
Holy shit was this an attempt at an actual joke
---
Amazing.
---
Seems like your not using items the game provides, multiple events provide exp bonus, sleeping in bed, cranberry juice, cranberry relish, brain bombs and or anything that raises your int... what‚Äôs your intellect? All items above stack to increase exp gains
---
The cargo bots that you are taking pictures are variants.  Take a picture at the one from the end of the event in Morgantown airport. It works everytime
---
Yeah its a stupid mod but possibly a new one?
---
yeah he sounds like the voice actor from that game .. like gta but with aliums .. forget the name .. SHARK TESTOSTERONE!!! YEAHHHHHH!!!! RAAAWWWRRR!!!
---
I like the grafton mayor voice actor cause he did firefly and I know a firefly fan that would pay me to say this which im gonna call now and said i said it
---
Soft serve?  I thought the only spawn point was at Charleston station?
---
What? All perk cards have animations when moused over...
---
Where exactly is the spawn point there cause 3 of us are server hopping and one of us can do that.
---
Alot of weapons need mods and are without currently
---
I did both of these last weekend.  When you are using your camera are you sure that the item is being identified by the camera in the top right corner of the screen?  You can take the picture but if the camera doesn't tag/identify the heads it will not count.
---
This is legit hilarious
---
I'm right there with u I wish I could rank up my animated cards but I can't because my non animated one is already maxed
---
What platform are you enjoying the game? I'm on PS4 and would love some company. Gamertag Sn0wMa78209.
---
The animated ones are the special ones in your packs
---
There has been talk since release for a revamp of the whole perk card mechanic. Trading or exchanging them seems like it would solve the problem well.
---
Thanks for reply. How do you mutate? Do you need high rads? If so dont you die much faster as youve got far less HP?
---
Perk cards?
---
Every perk pack you get an animated perk card
---
Not for a lvl 40, just sell it
---
Good on ya man :)
---
No there's another, just follow the road south from the shop by the tipped over white bus.
---
Wow. That... Is... Depressing. I actually have the suppressor. But I have 7 left to get I believe. The grind to get the mats is incredible. What is your tactic? And what is your intelligence?
---
This doesnt add anything that camps dont already do. It also conflicts with the main feature of the game, exploring. Central hubs turn an open world game into a lobby waiting simulator, and then the rp gets real weird. Then no one actually plays. The cabins would have to be instanced individually for everyone.
---
The random event will spawn by the bus or there abouts
---
They would need to balance it before anything else. The game has possibly the worst PvP I have ever played. Core gameplay and mechanically poorly done.
---
All of the shotgunners are maxed, 1 scattershot, all of demolitions expert, bloody mess, and grenadier. What most of the videos say to have
---
I mean, you're not wrong, but not exactly the reply I was waiting for.
---
If it went out to everyone, maybe 1-28 people would get it and the rest would get "World Full." And then have to wait until the world opened up, after the event. 
---
Even if it was only local servers I play with US friends and I'm in the UK, would I still be notified of events on UK servers?
---
They got nerfed last week so if those vids are old thats why.
---
Why be wary? Did you forget to check the charge before you bought it?
---
Caveat emptor!
---
Not good enough to base a hole build round it, but its still a good drop. Id sell it tbh.
---
Ah so it‚Äôs gonna stay maxed at 270?
---
I've had days like that also ..... but not this week.  Oh well .... good to know all is well, and will likely return for me as well .... at some point.
---
Use well rested, and cranberry relish. Team up and use the xp perk under charisma. Then go to West Tech
---
As much as I would love this, most players don't even party up or even communicate to each other. The players who would use a guild are already doing so outside the game. It's just how gamers are these days.
---
Whenever I'm the conduit I use PA and run around while tossing out nuka grenades like candy. This strategy works as long as people actually go after the faux sheepsquatch like they are supposed to.
---
My biggest issue lately is fences/gates. Especially gates. I can place a fence in a wall of fences, but I can't place a gate in the same spot. It either won't snap or says item is not supported.
---
16 lbs is 7.26 kg
---
I got NMS when it came out actually and it was so horrible üòÇ but now that I got fed up with glitches and put FO76 aside for a while I started up a new run of NMS. It is so much fun now and I do hope Bethesda pulls their head out their ass and turns stuff around. May have to pop into FO and see what‚Äôs changed since I left. It‚Äôs definitely possible they will do it we just need to wait and see.
---
Nope. Gotten the same
---
Theres houses and structures you can build in. Top of my head is the cult house and the raider fort nw of the ammo factory. Another is a camp west of radio research lab.
---
Hell id love them to fix how much resorses it costs us to fix end game armor or give more drops for balistic fiber as we cant alwase spend rl $$$ on 76 to buy auto repair
---
Same problem. I now have two stairs on the front part of house. I've decided to live with the ugliness until I find a new camp spot
---
yep, it's weird. I've read coments in the main and and I asked here, and most players with non-max alts, had different experiences‚Ä¶
---
thinking about to crack 20 two star weapons and 20 three star armors wth a level 15. I will share it here if I do it.
---
Do you have any data on charisma affecting the loot drops? How does it break down point wise.. if it does at all. Lately I think my 5 points in charisma may need to get bumped up but it's so hard to justify as I mainly play solo with 4 points on lone wanderer and one on travel agent. 
---
Anyway, very nice job! I wish my analyst were this in depth IRL, a lot of the time they just mail it in. LOL
---
Well in 1 small way there are less legendaries on the market because thwy are being scrapped, but i was talking about the rng slowing players down, not the device.
---
I have the same problem. I stay in the water and still fails every time. Lost all my stimpaks and rad away :(
---
Sorry I just went to Janet‚Äôs Soft Serve and went south and there was no bus?
---
How old is the video for a start? Without chems, adrenaline etc my shotty does about what yours is.
---
That would be pretty cool. let's hope that happens.
---
I noticed an improvement against Gutsies after getting the grounded mutation
---
Came here to say this. They already have the awesome ability to change your characters appearance on the fly, this would just make an awesome feature more awesome!
---
i wonder what use the skis could have in the vault
---
Which is another form of inflation control
---
Very very interesting. Not sure why...but it is interesting.
---
It's not a huge deal but it would be great to be able to use those nice animated ones.
---
Wait, does it work for someone to just be at an event with you? Or does it require you to be on teams?
---
Not buying but selling :)
---
Most of them go fast.
---
The earliest one was 2 months ago
---
What would be a decent price then, don‚Äôt want to totally give it away.

[Fallout 76 Road Map](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019)
---
I hate hate hate hate people CAMPing there. It's just frustrating, even if you can find him elsewhere. 
---
Speaking of elsewheres, if you walk road 88 West from Gilman Lumber, towards Alpine River Cabins, I've seen him on the road there once. It blew my mind lol. 
---
Good luck, regardless of people being dicks.
---
Oh...my...God lmao
---
This is as useless as fascinating.
---
Have my up for passion and effort
---
It's a random spawn. There could be enemies, or the vendor. It's usually enemies most of the time.
---
Lol me no like read. Put a TL;DR next time dude!
---
Lol it does sound a lot like Nathan Fillion but it's not him.
---
Id say, after the many nerfs, about 4-10k. Depends on the type of buyer. Id llok between that range. Maybe 5-10k.
---
Wait until you need to respec. You'll see
---
14 screws... damn
---
Fsheeeww fsheeeeeew pewpew fsheeew AAAARRGGGHH IM BLEEDING fsheeew pewpee daka daka pewpew I NEED BACK UP fsheeew
---
And now the well-intentioned idea is broken. LOL. Assist and Space Jam dunk complete.
---
You can sometimes find a hotdog on the burned out campfire grill where that modern type camper house is. You run SE from Poseidon Power substation up the hill. On the map it's the upper right corner of the drive in theater.
---
Follow the road near janet's, there is a crashed bus not far, random encounters spawn there.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be able to grab any of this. It‚Äôs just a starting hub nothing else. The real test is once you leave.
---
I'm level 180 something. It would be faster to start a new character than respec the existing one.
---
This is BEAUTIFUL
---
You sound like an asshole!
---
Bethesda were lazy. Maybe they will fix it.
---
some of the guns have a debuff legendary effect like suppress the enemies damage for 20 seconds
---
I level up many perma-characters and I've become addict to "Farma-Pharma" and "Can do it" now, lol. They are just greedy perks, but I need them asap to have some extra fun and mini-gambling while looting.
---
I thinks its a full 24 hours after you got the 150 . same thing hapoemd to me this morning then in the afternoon there was 150 mor3 scrips for me , NOW im stuck waiting for more because i have tons of legendarys i want to trade in for scrips ! Haha
---
+ to damage resist
---
Reduce 30 carry weight
---
Please note, does not provide energy or rad resist
---
I found it.  Also I might note, that one of our friends found him.  He DROPPED dead when another player spawned at the station (wasn‚Äôt us).  I saw this being a thing and WTF WHY.
---
The quest itself requires you to revive a player.  The swimmer badge requires you to revive one in shallow water.
---
Oh god all armed with three star wooden armors and junkie guns
---
I don't mind the lonliness, I feel it honestly brings a single player aspect to it as well. I feel like the randoms who don't talk, are other npcs,  but they are pretty inconsistent tbh.
---
Throw something down on the stairs and have fun!
---
Go to the scout leader at kiddie cabins up north. It sometimes bugs and doesn't give you the repeatable  but server hop.
---
I thought medic required the revive
---
We need a Bear Arms for rifles. I can carry four Gatlings and an LMG with Bear Arms. They weigh like 2 pounds then. My glorious handmades weigh in at 19-24 pounds no matter what.
---
The extra 100 is a bug. It's 200 until you die or exit the P.A but it is 100 not 200. Check your effects and you'll see it first hand
---
Me too lol
---
Missed the first try at Camp Venture but his motivation raised me back up.
---
How is it floating? Something to do with the power lines?
---
Int is 5, I buy junk items from players vending machines
---
Sbq event and encrypted events. Easy to revive a person in water during the encypted event as well. People always dying in the small pond
---
Considering all the downsides to the mods I‚Äôve ended up keeping mine standard.
---
My main character could rarely run without PA until recently. My second was gifted a bunch of guns and armor from my main at level 35, and she rarely puts on PA (usually for safety as she is a Bloodied build). Now that my main is about done w unlocking gun mods, I‚Äôm rarely at capacity because I only need junk to make ammo and other necessities.
---
If you look at MMOs like world of Warcraft, final fantasy 14, etc, you'll see that pretty much every online game with player vending/auctions has some kind of fee/tax taken out of every sale. It's for the same reason that those games all also have fees for fast travel. 
---
Players are constantly creating wealth from this sure by playing the game. Kill stuff, complete quests, sell to npc vendors, and poof! Currency is created. If you keep creating new currency, without taking some back out of the economy, it leads to massive inflation. Some guess away from players quitting the game, but usually at nowhere near the rate needed, so you create money sinks. Expensive things for players to buy like housing and vanity items, but also little costs that are part of day to day life. Fast travel fees. Sales taxes.
---
It's part of every online game that even attempts to have a functional economy.
---
Ouch...that's a kick in the atoms.
---
That would be game changing! This is a co-op game after all
---
The thing you have to take in to account is there are very few CM, maybe 4 or 5? That's a lot of replies you'd be asking from them. From what I've seen they tend to reply mostly to serious bug reports, which I feel is fair enough.
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 26 and I act as 1 most times once I activate one I try to stay on the outer edges while still shooting stuff
---
How so? (Other than GTAO I‚Äôve not played any PvP, so genuinely curious).
---
I agree! That's why I want to push for players being able to trigger events at least once a day or through a cooldown timer. Just like the Scorchbeast Queen and the Imposter Sheepsquatch events are triggered by a Nuke/Recall Code, I want to be able to trigger the other events such as Enclave Events, Grafton Day, The Messanger and so on. Sometimes we just want to play the events we like and with this player started mechanic we rely less on random pop ups and instead make them more repeatable and add some more player control to the map.
---
Nice work and thank you!  I‚Äôm saving this post because I‚Äôm so tired of pausing the game and scrolling all the way through those menus.
---
Do you know how much DR it gives specifically?
---
You can buy them in Flatwoods for up to 750 caps, or get them as a reward for Events like Fertile Soil.
---
If you mean a world spawn, I'm still looking myself.
---
Would Sentinel be BoS VI? The highest I have so far is Knight SGT. I did see a player vending T-60 pieces painted in BoS V, which I'm guessing is Elder?
---
Agreed! It took us like 20 hops to get him! He could of took part in the process. I‚Äôm always happy when people can get cool shit for cheap!
---
Now I can
---
There is a camping tent on the northern entry of Whitesprings up the hills.
---
And right above is a tree with 4 resin
---
I have repeatedly taken pictures of stuff that is fully labeled and in frame but doesn't count. Tried dead and alive. Not sure what the issue is, but it's very frustrating.
---
Dude you are the perfect example of what any community should be like.
---
What you play on ?
---
I think so to. Once Private Servers and Mods become a thing and they actually function properly, ONLY then I can safely say that I love this game. However for now I can say that I am having a good time and am eager to try what comes next.
---
10mm SMGeezy,  
---
Turn it sideways and squeezey,  
---
bitches get queasy,   
---
‚Äòcause I make it look easy,
---
Players have rights to have their camps defended from malicious griefers who go out of their way to destroy things and ruin gameplay just for kicks and giggles. Having camps immune from damage unless you are directly locked into PvP with the owner or team was the right thing to do in a game based mostly around PvE. I would suggest you to go play Rust, it sounds like they have the perfect gameplay which you are looking for.
---
No idea had the same question but then realised I had picked up ‚Äòsturdy‚Äô robot legs along the way somewhere.. might be worth checking if you have
---
I hd a guy come up as i arrived at the camp ask if i was doing it.  He had a mic so i fave him the thumbs up and he asked if i wanted to do the revive together so we did.  Just asking people in general i think you‚Äôd be surprised that someone will take a couple of minutes of time to help you if needed.
---
The raider camp outside top of the world station spawns two bottles on a table.
---
I'm not getting random pics register even if their name appears.
---
Eminem?
---
I want to down vote you 100 times for missing the point.
---
Been selling them in my camp, quite popular
---
If rust was on playstation, I would play it. Until then I'm stuck with wimps like you.
---
Individual, dunno what the guy above is on about but definitely a Nerf. You could get all pieces to proc, or none. 
---
As far as in pve, used to be able to do awol and take 0 dmg from the 10 gutsies at once. Now they do a good amount of damage, can possibly kill you if they get some good shots in.
---
On2muchcoffee
---
Initiate- BOS I
---
Knight- BOS II
---
Knight Sgt- BOS III 
---
Knight Cpt- BOS IV 
---
Paladin- BOS V 
---
Elder- BOS VI 
---
Officer- BOS (no number)
---
Note that Captain and Sergeant drop out of order, and Officer drops before Paladin. 
---
I'm not sure if buying and learning one out of order keeps you from getting one before it, nobody has ever posted if that keeps you from getting one of them. 
---
I'd kinda like to know though, because after getting I-II-IV-III I bought Paladin and Elder, and still haven't pulled officer; I'm still farming Technical Data to find out.
---
Did you get them from scrapping other combat armor pieces?
---
Thanks man for doing the work all us FO4 vets were wondering about.
---
Bought them at a vendor
---
I have the marsupial mutation, so I sit on roof tops and he will draw in enemies. I have it maxed out and he shows up a lot. Great for soloing groups of enemies in my opinion.
---
Did you click on the plans to learn them?
---
Did you use the plans for them?
---
You know you can destroy environmental objects like cars and stuff instead of wasting like 10 minutes and  some untold amount mats of some player to fix their camp.
---
yes i made sure that it says the name. For the cats there are 3 heads and it does say 3 cat heads. but the brahmin clearly says Bramihn... Had the same issue while trying to take pictures of the robots. it would show all of them but the cargo... so annonying :(
---
If you go to your camp device, you should be able to repair everything at once.
---
It is a mod for combat armor. You add it to existing armor not craft separately.
---
On xb1? I have a great boxing glove for this.
---
‚ÄúIt just works.‚Äù
---
Thanks, I was very confused
---
I prefer to destroy stuff that belongs to other players.  It was much more enjoyable.
---
The only thing I didn't like about collecting junk from the silos was that you gotta go through a good portion of it to scrap it all, or waddle on out and over to a place that has a workbench. I too dislike using pa. But I'm softening up to the idea since I'm a squishy meatbag at Nuke events with my hazmat and 3 endurance. Had a particularly embarrassing moment yesterday where I jumped in the air to avoid a mongrel dog only to get headbutted by a radroach and die. Everyone saw. It wasn't fun.
---
ü§î never thought of that!
---
Are you wearing any clothing besides the swimsuit? A similar thing was happening to me, failed every time I hit a certain buoy. Then I tried taking off the hat I was wearing and it worked.
---
What sucks for me is that I end up dealing enough damage that it aggros on me every time.  I can't be the conduit or my ass gets blasted even faster than it already does.
---
Like I've said plenty,  I play survival every day. The CAMPS are indestructible there too.
