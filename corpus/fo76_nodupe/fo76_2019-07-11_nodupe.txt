I finally finished the last of the achievements in this game yesterday.
---
---
---
So far the fix seems to be installing it on the same drive your OS is on. If you're like me and can't/don't want to do that, you're SOL
---
Are legendary perk cards out now?
---
Hide and seek I said here first
---
Awesome, thought so. Cheers man and thanks!
---
I wouldn't mind a "repair armor" challenge, but requiring 10 for a DAILY???   That's (literally) repairing every piece you wear, TWICE.  
---

---
Today's dailies seem really harder than the previous ones.
---
33
---
Np and good luck.  Don't forget to learn all the new ones you find since they only drop unknown plans
---
I see I'm being summoned. So as I've told everyone else that has reached out to me is my fix is for the PC version. But I have been informed your game has to be installed on the same drive as your OS.
---
For 1998 that game and then Fallout 2 was quite a hit.
---
&gt; Wait what, I can sneak to an NPC, snoop their inventory, put an activated bomb and it will blow him up? Neat!
---
&gt; Oooh, if I use multiple Super Stimpaks on an NPC, the drawback will kill them without me becoming aggressive, neato
---
&gt; Hey, that kid NPC just stolen from me! *Brrrrrrr* hah, take that! (you cannot kill kids in games this days)
---
Rank 33. Let me see if I can find and link you the chart.
---
Edit: here you go

Denied!
---
I only rush to get my alternate characters to lv 50!
---
Welcome to bethesda games
---
[Heres a guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/)
---
Heyyyy bearr....lol. He really just came out of no where!! 😂😂😂
---
I played Diablo 1 and 2 hardcore on bnet... those were the good ol days :)
---
I've seen varying information, but the one I have saved states that by the 13th you have to be 33. I'm not entirely sure how accurate that is, but I believe it and most other guides don't take into account the x2 weekend upcoming or any other potential events unannounced. 
---
Also you have 10 ranks worth of atoms from the board if you so wish, as well as the ability to purchase ranks for 150 each very soon (bad or good it exists).
---
I’m confused I have the carnivore mutation from rads locked in with starched genes but no serum does that mean the brain fungus soup just wouldn’t work ? That’s a great perk for an hour
---
Hahaha :D
---
And it’s too bad that you assumed that a handful of clickbaiters that had a negative agenda to push and mostly didn’t play the game more than 30 minutes were representative of the valid and balanced content creators. 
---
That’s like saying that because you didn’t like one program on TV you stopped watching TV altogether. 
---
We also aren’t talking about just ‘opinion pieces’. I’m talking about the actual content and walkthrough creators. 
---
But, hey, you clearly learned everything to know about YouTube by watching two or three videos, lol.
---
I don't think so. I've seen people wearing Fasnacht masks with the suit, and still being in stealth.
---
At level 40 that's amazing congratulations :)
---
Mr gutsy’s and Yao Guaita are the worst
---
No, he probably drunk buys FO1 like I did. Or atoms
---
Seriously? I'm not even going to be 30 by the time this week is over.
---
I think so too. When you're used to having to rush through content just to be able to play with others it can be hard to stop doing that.
---
i am lvl 301 so i guess i dont count
---
See, I like the meat piles because you can hear the flies and find the loot easier that way. Turn up effects in your options. It's not perfect, but it's better than jumping a million times to look all around and still have no idea where the body landed.
---
I've learned more than I wanted to know about YouTube from what I have seen.
---
I'm glad you have acquired infinite wisdom from all the YouTube videos you have watched to put me down in such a way, cool man.
---
 Keep up the good fight wastelander!
---
Haha nice. If I still played FO76, I'd hop in but I'd probably just slow everyone down at this point
---
Welp...the bears figured out stealth boys.  We're all screwed.
---
Check out cultists camps at night, better odds.
---
I’m in. I’d like to do a camp at the swim club.
---
Very interesting
---
Crops and water purifiers are unlocked.  All my workbenches are available for folks to use.  I did lock down my lead extractor, and acid extractor because I use both to make ammo.  
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I have one locked door in my camp, for my bedroom.  Because I don't want anyone else messing up my sheets  :)
---
"The community" tends to be disproportionately represented by the loudest and angriest idiots on reddit while statistics speak for themselves and show the whole picture.
---
I couldn't find enough critters in my patches alas before it turned over.
---
32
---
Most of those are invincible though...
---
I was able to play two days of this season and then left to play other games.
---
Coming back to One Appalachia thou.
---
I see you have our missing property, give it to our newest member swiper so he can put it in that unguarded and unlocked warehouse over there.
---
cool, that drive is only big enough for the OS and has no room for fallout
---
And the critism it got brought along wastelanders, which got good reviews.  So you have consider that constructive criticism has actually helped.
---
I can't find that option on Xbox. PC only I assume? The grass, I mean.
---
Serums suppresses the negative effects of mutations for a short while. I believe that food buffs from plant based meals no longer effect players with Carnivore after the latest patch. Drinking the Carnivore serum every couple hours will allow you to still get the buffs from plants, but it's expensive to keep that up.
---
It's actually super easy just collect some random weapons off of enemies and repair those before scrapping them.
---
The fact that you said that if you’d watched YT videos you would have never played the game is interesting. It means that you’re worried that your opinion would be easily influenced. 
---
That explains why you choose to avoid things like that. You’re aware that you’re too easily swayed. 
---
That’s a smart idea. It’s good to recognize one’s own limitations and take action to protect yourself. 
---
Take care, kid!
---
I believe you need to know the plan for it to drop from the pool
---
Yeah I do those,craft some cranberry relish for 2xp,then do a lap for ballistic fibre and rubber. Done.
---
If i ever get my alt rolling id try a bloodied build, i just use heavy weapons and a few additional favs (plasma flamer, tesla), i wear power armor because its cool looking. I play my way
---
I tried to take one down at level 25 in same place you saw yours had two super mutants helping me and I didn't even make a dent gave up and walked away after using most of my ammo
---
Boy you just keep on going don't you lol.  You're like the Energizer Bunny.
---
You remind me of a Bernie bigot.
---
Like they do when you complete a quest and they shove some sturdy leather left leg in your pocket. I like the idea of getting surprised by a quest reward when I don't see it listed. Surprise legendary loot would be cool.
---
[deleted]
---
Dont know what triggers it, but when you kill them really hard and fast you can hear some of them say "we're so fucked". Happens alot when you roll up with very high damage weapons I think.
---
What’s OS and SOL? Sorry, fairly new to PC
---
If they do that, they will get hit with "now the daily cap limit is gone, how an I supposed to get caps?!" Honestly I think they are in a no win situation right now.
---
Thank you guys just got the challenge with all your help.
---
The vendor upstairs in my home are for my private stash so, the game won't auto scrapped my collection. The only working one is downstairs on the front porch.
---
"People complain on the fallout page a little too much to be playing the game everyday." 
---
Is not positive feedback.
---
Agreed, this is a nonsense post designed to stir up shit. 
---
If you’re going to make an allegation like this then back it up with some proof. 
---
I don’t doubt new exploits will pop up from time to time but it would help to be able to distinguish fact from fiction.
---
Agreed. Guild Wars 2 Dailies are done in this fashion. You have PvE Dailies and PvP Dailies. Whichever you complete, counts toward you over all daily progression, doesn't matter which set is done.
---
This worked for me. My Games is in Users\\Documents not OneDrive however.
---
I dislike the 'surprise' mechanics of this game sometimes.
---
Awesome indeed....
---
For all the base weapons, they are just in there.
---
For things like the fixer, the bear claw, you have to have gotten the plan.
---
Those are great!
---
Make it a sort of miscellaneous mission like collect you dropped loot
---
Excellent shots! Definitely some excellent photography skill showing through these. From one photographer to another!
---
If I’m not mistaken it was mentioned by one of the community managers a few months ago when one of the previous dupe waves was going on.
---
I’m confused, why would it add a strain to the servers? Wouldn’t a server just see it as another line of code like everything else in the game? The stash box limit example doesn’t make sense either. You can store unlimited amounts of junk in a scrap box without bogging down a server.
---
I don't either really. It feels like work and a lot of the time it just breeds drama. People nitpicking each others' builds and bickering over drops. It's stupid.  
---
I, too, just want to gather trash in piece lol.
---
I have the exact same issue.. super annoying
---
Positive feedback to the people who are upset about the game. No. Positive feedback to the game? Yes.
---
Not sure why they don't allow it, to be honest. Maybe it was because so many people were linking NSFW screenshots. Like the guy using cannibal on a Responder corpse's ass, remember? Anyway, there's a way around it. You put it on imgur and then link the imgur URL
---
Thank you!!
---
Sure I'll be on in about an hour. They consisted of fully modded lvl 1 pipe revolver, lvl 5 pump shotgun, and lvl 15 handmade with some ammo for all. Also full set of modded out leather armor. Tell me what level you are and I'll adjust accordingly.
---
The only invincible one i've found is at the enlightenment event.  
---
The rest die.
---
Thank you so much! I’m flattered
---
The Fixer, Bear Arm, Shepherd's Crook, Sheepsquatch Club &amp; Staff, and all bullion weapons/armors are only added to the pool after learning the plans. Everything else is in the pool by default.
---
I don't remember if you need to know the plans for bows or compound bows in order for them to appear in the legendary pool.
---
There were a stream of low levels from vault 76 down the wayward on most of the servers I played on today.
---
You can always post it here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutPhotography/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FalloutPhotography/)
---
OS = Operating System. SOL = Shit Out (of) Luck
---
YASS!
---
Rocksy in the background, completing the bears quest..
---
"Can I cross this name of my list or what?"
---
I think it’s been like this, I just post images on a different sub
---
Thank you. People who complain about nothing to do have never played a Bethesda game before its evident
---
its literally complaining about complaining.
---
not complaining about something that needs fixing
---
literally just complain for the SAKE of complain
---
You don't happen to be using the Scorched-killer mod, do you?
---
Ever go to a train station and try to use the legendary exchange machine or sell items to the vendor bot but some dim wit just AFK’d to take a smoke break and now you have to go to a different location to use the machine you specifically went there for....that’s why. I don’t want to leave my base open for a horde of people to use my camp so I have to wait in a line at my camp items. That’s Why!!!!
---
Use a mobile app.  I  know Apollo (iPhone, not sure if there is an Android version) has the ability to attach images directly.  Otherwise, load it on a third-party site and copy the link.
---
I'm always high.
---
I keep my bedroom and vendors in an area I can change the door frames into walls for when I am near cap limit or want to drop items for a teammate without risk of someone running up and grabbing it. I dropped a couple thousand .308 rounds for a teammate once and someone jumped in, nabbed, and jumped out in a way that was so hilariously well timed and sudden that I couldn’t even be angry about it, but I learned my lesson.
---
Man it is such a grind 😩
---
Where do you go for ballistic fiber? I can never keep it in stock due to the chinese stealth armor.
---
I've no idea what that is I'm on Xbox of that helps
---
I just started fresh on Xbox after level 543 on PS4. I forgot how many times I died first outings.
---
And there it is!  He made it political.
---
I knew it wouldn’t be too long before that happened.
---
I think even all the veterans who quit all came back recently for reasons unknown lol. And they all hang out at train stations smh
---
Farming the queen used to guarantee a prime receiver plan you don't know. Not sure if it still does this. But be sure you learn them all as they drop, otherwise you will have duplicates
---
Can’t take your time if you want to hit level 100 SCORE without spending money though ☹️
---
No like the weapon mod
---
Pretty easy to go specific when you run heavy weapons. With perks you can carry around one of each type for what a single hunting rifle would cost. Kind of crazy actually.
---
This works!! guess this is the faster and better way around this issue for those who cant transfer the whole game to another drive
---
No. Patch 20 was the last patch that dropped. Perks are supposed to come with patch 22
---
Yeah that was definitely  a professional hit.  Yao Guai are forming their own faction.
---
Doors? Who puts doors on their camps?
---
Yes.
---
post a link and a small description would be nice as well..
---
I mean, well yeah, it's one of the daily challenges. So nice, or cute or whatever, it's a challenge so people are doing it. Not particularly altruistic but no harm in looking at it that way...
---
No it's just a normal double barrel quad with hardened receiver . Not prime, sorry didn't understand
---
Thank you!  Are you on PS4?  Look me up sometime....game name is Seth_Bollock (stupid I know....I’m a Deadwood fan and used to play a ton of RDO).
---
It’s one of those “it’s a feature not a bug” that actually feels like a feature though I’ve never come across a legendary stingwing or bloodbug that I remember
---
Thank you! Omg I have been trying to play this since yesterday. I tried all Bethesda's "solutions" and when I heard you had to have the game on the same drive as window, but that wasn't an option for me so I settled to wait for a patch but I tried this and it worked!!!! Thank you!!!
---
It has to do with servers having to register individual items as unique lines of code. With junk, it’s one code line with a variable. With items such as weapons, it’s the code line for the base item, plus the code line for the prefix, minor, and major effects, as unique code, since it’s a unique item. Take in to account all the items of all the players on the server? It would in the very least, slow it down.
---
I have no problem buying atoms if i really want something. I dint get people aversion to sir ding money. It’s entertainment. Any money I spend on entertainment is money I consider disposable.
---
There are many spots on the legendary run we’re you get 150 atoms. If you want to buy a level it costs 150 atoms. You’ll earn enough to buy ten levels. 
---
If you don’t buy levels, then have atoms to spend in the shop.
---
Fort Defiance
---
I've tried to vary my guns, use others for less challenging areas, bet I just get away from my Combat Shotgun and Handmade. Both 2* and TSE. Enforcer and all the sniper perks. Make them crawl , casual execution. You name it, doesn't matter the size, anything can be put down.
---
I need to give bloodied and unyielding a go when I can trade up. I have a few rare masks and plans. I'm a patient guy.
---
Lmao my vendors are underground
---
Not political.  You just remind me of one of my friends. He cant stand that others don't think like he does. I call him a Bernie Bigot.
---
Shit bro, the way this game is, I need a couple drinks to take the edge off just to play this rotten bastard.
---
I am glad to I didn't want to reformat my drive just to play this.
---
Yes reboot you router and modem ...and full shutdown xbox
---
Edit : you can also clear the reserved space file in your fallout 76 data...this will delete your photos but will stop this error
---
I've been making deep pocket armour all day for the new Xbox players some are greatful other just take it like i owe them it.
---
Funny how that happens, right?
---
Yeah, cause getting blasted ground zero is way easier....
---
Same
---
On top of that a very bad pc port. Runs so bad on a beefy pc, no way that devs playing their own game on pc, it's hard to enjoy with all the framedrops
---
You’re stretching the meaning of the topic too hard.
---
I hate the fact that they can hit you repeatedly with the same paw with no "cooldown". Like it staggers you with the first hit and then instantly hits you two more times before it would realistically be able to hit you again.
---
Lore wise it doesn't open until ten years after the base game happens, so its supposed to be sealed in game. Of course a silly thing like lore hasn't stopped Bethesda from doing anything before, so why stop now.
---
I agree. I actually enjoy the S.C.O.R.E. system.
---
Level 9 ATM
---
Honestly ive been blessed with this not happening to me yet but maybe when todd stole my gatling gun he paid it back with some luck.
---
Maybe mine was glitched... can never tell with 76
---
I miss seeing new people in 76 on PS4. I mostly see the same pool of users and 60ish leveled users.
---
"at my current pace" is the key phrase here. They want you to play MORE than your current pace. I'm always baffled that people seem to forget that these developers design everything to encourage and reward players for logging more hours. They could care less if you have a family, career, etc that requires more of your attention.
---
Amazed there isn’t a rating system for camps. I’ve seen some awesome ones that just make me wish I were more creative lol
---
I thought of doing that too because I detest Nuclear Winter, but felt guilty that I wasn't helping my team mates....
---
Ive had this happen to me I'm told it's a glitch if you play NW then adventure
---
I m pretty sure they changed the pvp aspect of the game. So even if you engaged I don’t think his friend could get into the fight. Haven’t tested it yet though
---
Sure, just add me!
---
searching for 9 creatures is hard for non BR people. We still didn't know when and where the crits spawn.  
---
1 hour before reset: fok me, my armors and weapons all broken, need to repair.  
---
login after reset: fok me...
---
its far more annoying when a reasonable request or report of a bug gets mobbed by "positive" assholes who call you entitled or to quit the game because you dare have a critique or problem with the game. 
---
at least complaint threads prompt discussion, without them its the same posts copied again and again
---
"this community is so great"
---
"look at these atom shop things!"
---
"this game is so good"
---
"look at this funny thing i found"
---
none of which help in addressing the massive litany of problems this game has. its just circlejerk.
---
Every now and again I will look at this subreddit to see if it is worth getting back into the game, and every time I see people asking for the same simple QOL stuff they have since the first week, it's a bummer
---
The whitespring swim area?
---
I have the bbn problem all the time as I play a long range rifleman build. I have lost too many legendaries because I cant find the bodies, bloatflies  are the worst
---
They convert three at a time into points at the ammo converter though. I've been grinding those and 40mm grenades into fuel for a hungry flame thrower lol
---
Thanks, ill have to add that to my farming runs.
---
I just skipped it. That's an hour or two long challenge on its own, even if you have an idea where they are.
---
Your teammate are probably doing the same thing you are so don't worry about it.
---
Very few people play NW because they enjoy it. The rest are going for rewards or score.
---
Yeah the game started and showed a generic landscape and i immediately was like where are my pictures
---
That won’t happen most likely. pc has way to many hacked weapons anyway.
---
You wouldnt have to kill them if they would stop taking foundations shit. The 2 raider dailies come from someone being so fed up with living in crater they leave or another one of their shotty thingamajigs broke again. Either way they have shitty lving conditions and crap infrastructure. The settlers seem pretty happy and mind their own business. Yeah they might be a little intolerant but thats because theyre smart and want to make sure so.ething isnt a threat before they reach out an olive branch. But my point is that the settlers will always be the choice for long term survival. The raiders are so dependent on others to do work for them that they cant sustain themselves without feeding off others. The settlers will just keep doing their thing growing and expanding more and more from within.
---
So he said that he had done everything in the game...
---
...knowing that he didn’t complete the main quest?
---
MODUS is very disappointed.
---
Do an event with molemen or super mutants, collect their half broken guns, finish event, repair their weapons and sell at a profit.  It may be a drag but it takes 10-15 minutes to finish two challenges.  It isn't that hard, but if it was, imagine how much players would complain.  They already do about some score just being in NW.
---
If this is like Destiny 2 seasons, less people will play the seasons.... seasons are fundamentally just time sinks.  Play or don't.
---
Personally, I'll set this game down for cyberpunk 2077 and return when there is real story DLC dropping.
---
Yeah that would be helpful also I'd like to know what I could possibly get as a drop from each event I'm trying to farm for Forrest Jump suit etc if I could see what events to do to that may drop them that would be really helpful
---
Without spoiling much of anything, the base storyline is following the Overseer’s Holotapes and eventually being put in the position of taking drastic (and fun!) measures to deal with the Scorched. If a living person (robots and AI don’t count) other than the Overseer is involved, it’s part of the expansion.
---
Can confirm, I made that mistake and now Crater hates me.
---
You could probably get one pretty cheap right now
---
Yup. And it seems like a lot of other players feel like that too. Yesterday and today every world I get thrown into is dead. No one around to do events and only one group active with no one on it? I do the dailies and log off now, just burnt out on it.
---
Yeah, you want to get the raid done as soon as you can so you can start getting treasury notes from events. The rep grind takes ages. Just make sure you do both sides quests up to the point where you have 'siding with ...' quests for both of them then pick a side ans get it done, then just do dailies and random encounters to up your rep.
---
As for the bullion question, if you want secret service armor or power armor, take all of the bullion. Otherwise, you'll have enough gold before you get the rep grind finished for the faction weapons.
---
Yeah it sucks, I remember launching and there being basically nobody but low levels. And I got no specific build so I’m not killing the queen in a hit or 2. Launches nukes the last 2 days and before I attempt it I check the map for high level players.
---
I mean I heard of one, I accidently found a way to sell ammo to vendors
---
That's an OOF
---
Dang, I never would have thought about that. That's really cool. I might have that plan....
---
This is actually a very good explanation of the progression system in this game.
---
Doubt it
---
I hate that people have come to "it's stupid, so quit" effectively. I know how to finish all the challenges, they just don't include playing the game in any way similar to what the game is.
---
" People complain on the fallout page a little too much to be playing the game everyday."
---
this is just a  "if you dont like the game. quit" post with some BS excuses for bethesdas continued laziness and incompetence.
---
that, or you are new and just lack perspective which is understandable i guess.
---
You can buy some stuff from NPC vendors
---
If you mean the damage pop ups when u make a hit, that’s not a perk card, it’s a toggle able option in the settings menu
---
i have the same problem !! but its the team up emote thats missing. Its not showing on the atomic shop !!
---
I don’t care whether you ‘think like I do or not’. You’re apparently not getting that. 
---
I’m amused by your under-informed prejudiced opinions.
---
That’s it. That’s the whole thing. 
---
Like YouTube or dislike YouTube. That’s not the point. 
---
The steps you used to come to that conclusion is what’s hilarious. 
---
Later!
---
There is a setting for this
---
Wow!!!! So amazing!
---
3-4 hours for a level? wat. And levelling a new character is actually the quickest way to do it so why moan about that when it's the best way to do it? Like. You moaned about it and then solved the problem you moaned about in the same sentence. 
---
I repaired a load of low level weapons i picked up. it's that easy and simple and i wont miss the few materials it took. 
---
If the challenges were actually challenging people would complain. More.
---
It would help greatly if you can say your specific disability so at least the community could try to help and offer suggestions.
---
Unless youre just saying you're old and slow? Not trying to be rude.
---
Yeah its a tough subject but faster more frequent bans means less of a reason to dupe in Fo76 to this type and cutting off revenue streams like ebay by going after them on vendor sites or if need be the vendor themselves goes a long way.
---
Thanks a lot man!
---
It's not a card. It's in your gameplay settings.
---
I had someone drop round to my camp ages ago when I was about LVL 26 and drop a ton of shotgun ammo (like 2000 rounds I think?). Since then I have been trying to pay that kindness forward. I'm using an unarmed build now so any ammo I find I list in my vendors for free so people can take what they need. I'm going to start also giving away simple stuff like purified water and what not. I've been really loving this community and the friendliness of the average player. Hands down my favourite time to play the game was during Fasnacht, I just loved sharing around masks and plans to newer players and just the general community all heading down to one location for something we all enjoyed.
---
For all the ups and downs this game has gone through, the community still stands as a beacon.
---
I've missed a few of the NW challenges and I'm lvl 33, guess the weekly +100 score per 10,000xp does work.
---
You keep saying later but yet you don't go away. You also keep saying that you don't care but you keep responding.
---
You are a strange bird man.
---
Just southwest of Crater
---
Not an expert at it, but I think you lose cards once you have the max number available for each "permutation" of a card. So if a card has 3 stars/ranks, you can get 6 total. enough for a copy of rank 3, rank 2 and rank 1. I don't think that the animated cards count against that limit though.
---
Land mines and turrets are a bush wookie's best friends. And eventually when you get enough practice a sniper rifle headshot is even more effective.
---
Full unyeilding set, serendipity, nerd rage, iron clad. Check your serums.
---
OK after reading that entire wall of text, I realised that none of that text had anything to do with the question in the header.
---
Thanks for that. Now I want to lock my camp.
---
But anyways, people lock their camp because it's their camp, not yours. Despite this game being online, most players still play the game mostly single player the majority of the time. Their camp is their own and for their own use, not others.
---
Also don't allow legendary enemies or enemies that need to be looted for continuation of a quest to explode due to bloody mess. Not only does this make find the legendary in a mess of gore harder but it also runs the risk of it going out of bounds, thus rendering it completely unlootable.
---
I once built my camp into the cliff side on the north edge of the map, and made sure all my vendors faced towards the only available spot for people to spawn in. Worked great until I had a guy spawn in and get stuck in my floor, and due to being in fall animation I had to dig him out
---
Got to go xbox setting, subscriptions and cancel it there
---
Vats are pretty bugged and with a shotgun (I use em too) you need to get closer even when it says 95%.
---
But then, all of a sudden, you'll have the oneshot - gun fu - oneshot chain of 4 or 5 mobs and you'll feel the master of the universe. 😂🤷🏻‍♂️
---
There should be a link to xbox homepage where to cancel it
---
I was literally standing on top of them lol
---
oh look another counterjerk thread for people that cant handle that people have criticism of the game.
---
Bump.  But I can’t figure out how to name a pet.  It just indicates it will go back to camp and that’s it (seeing it back at camp is another issue entirely).  What am I missing?
---
That explains why I can’t find it. Thank you!
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but is Warden voiced by Matt Mercer?
---
Thank you!

A similar thing happened to me at the start of the legendary run. I had started a new character, got up to lvl 5 and was on my way to a quest objective when I see two players, a lvl 2 in a vault suit and a lvl 5 in the mountain scout outfit. The lvl 2 was hitting me with a pipe wrench while the lvl 5 was sitting back with a hunting rifle just waiting for me to hit that other dude so he could pop me. Not gonna happen kiddo, your mountain scout outfit spoiled your little party...
---
I would love to see it implemented sometime in the future
---
I am that person. I need to level up as fast as I can. I must be end game ready. I must do the most dps. 
---
Two weeks later, I have done everything, beat the end game, and farm for a few more drops. 
---
Three weeks later... I'm still here, mostly log in to help friends. Chat on discord. Goof around. Log out. 
---
Four weeks later... I haven't been seen in days. My friends are texting me. Sending me discord messages. I'm in incognito mode. I'm playing something else. You've been ghosted.
---
Five weeks later, I've found a new game. I come to tell you about it. It's amazing. You have to play it! It's ONLY $20. Come on cheapskate. Buy it!
---
The cycle continues. Thanks for reading. 
---
Back to reality, it is a gift and a curse. I love it because I can experience most of what the game has to offer. I get to experience broken/overpowered things before they get nerfed. It sucks because when my friends are playing said games, I'm not because I've burned out weeks ago. 
---
Kind of wish I could stop and smell the roses, but I can't. I've tried. I get bored. 
---
Anyways, thanks again for reading! Never meant for this to be a dialogue or story but that's how it came out. Haha. Take care!
---
Thanks for you infinite wisdom lol
---
The one SW of Crater, or maybe acid springs
---
There will be no Crossplay between console and PC.
---
Uh, did you add me? i don't wanna work on some guys camp unbeknownst
---
Hey man, when i try to paste that file into that folder it says i access revoked i need admin rights? im confused xD
---
nvm, did it, damn it works man gg big brain
---
You're very welcome! 🖤
---
When that happens I just exit vats and start again, it is annoying indeed...
---
It can’t be just on ps4, I got it and I played on a Xbox one
---
Take the perk card white knight if you haven’t already. It’ll reduce the required amount.
---
When they had the “pick 3 locks” challenge I googled where to find three locks together I picked the spot on the map to spawn and found that everyone else googled the same thing. It was a 9 player bout of fisticuffs
---
this is just another BS counterjerk thread.
---
newer players who make excuses for bethesda not fixing thing for months and months or even since launch.
---
only atom shop and happy flower circlejerks allowed here.
---
I said in the post nothing but my game pass sub shows up there
---
You missed the whole point. I am creating a new character, leveling it and deleting it each day. That is somehow a challenge? Perhaps we should change then to daily TEDIUM. 
---
Do shit that you would never do in the game because it makes.no sense in context.
---
Hey this worked for me thank you so much!
---
I will as soon as I’m on
---
oh! the waterpark!
---
Good programmers make fewer bugs.Bethesda needs to “gitgud”.
---
This game is a bug ridden joke,honestly it shouldn’t be an A title by a experienced developer.If people are able to “dupe” ,it’s %100 Bethesda’s fault.The option shouldn’t even be there and if it’s found it needs to be hot fixed within 24hrs and perpetrators sanctioned in some way.
---
This is not a single player game,this shit just simply cannot happen in online multiplayer.They will never have successfull PVP or a balanced play experience as long as the failures continue.
---
As long as this kind of stuff continues to happen patch after patch,this game will be a B title,just like it is today.
---
I always have a vault boy cut out pointing to mine so its easy to spot, because i too feel your pain. Some peoples camps are so annoying lol.
---
The ones with the annoying vendors are usually the stupid floating houses.
---
The satisfaction of knowing they stole from someone just starting out/s. 
---
If you need some loot and are on pc ill gladly give you some water/stims if you need em. Most of the community is very helpful in game tbh.
---
But if I don't know about them yet I can't look them up! Some I know I want but I'm sure there are more I don't even know about.
---
If you are not having fun doing the challenges, why do them at all? Play the game how you want to, and when you are done, move on.  It’s a video game after all... there are other games and any number of other ways to spend precious free time
---
seems like the usually response to issues it "dont play the game" because they cant actually defend bethesda no fixing something like god mode for **20+ PATCHES**
---
I was addicted before and I’m addicted now, all that’s changed is that at the end of the day
---
I need to check off a few very easy checkboxes.
---
I’m curious. Why are you playing at all if it’s just work to you?
---
Never happeb
---
You're welcome!
---
If you set your base along the western river on the map (the river where the nuka plant and mothman town are positioned) and build half on the shoreline and river, you end up having only one direction where enemies spawn, as nothing spawns in the water or from the end of the map.
---
This basically means that while you still have some low level enemies spawn, depending on where you setup, you'll quickly figure out where they spawn, set three turrets down facing that direction and you rarely have any issues.
---
Where I'm at, either scorched, mole rats, protections, ghouls or mongrels will spawn, but die seconds after spawning.
---
They've put in their time?
---
Idk.
---
I always give low levels stuff, they usually never take it though.
---
Because you keep misrepresenting the facts. 
---
Sooner or later, you’ll learn that while you can have your own set of opinions, you can’t have your own set of facts. 
---
And it was still political. That fact that you came up with a name for someone you know that uses a political reference shows that’s the kind of mindset you have. 
---
And, here’s a hint; later doesn’t have a time limit. It can be one second or one year or any length of time at all. 
---
Silly little boy, lol.
---
Here’s how I avoid it.
---
* Log on an see what the dailies are.
---
* Determine which character I want to play based on the dailies challenges
---
* Beyond the dailies challenges, set a goal for myself - usually it’s “complete my faction dailies“ and then some other non-RNG related things like “Scout out a new camp location and think of the theme for it” or “Let’s see if I can take over all of the workshops” or “Let’s take a look at this location and see how many containers that could trigger pharma farma are there”.
---
* Log into the game and kinda plan my route.  I try to avoid fast traveling if I can, random encounters can be fun to encounter, and sometimes I can get a good picture of a sunrise/sunset or just see as the weather changes.
---
* If I’m playing on a public server, I’ll try to stop by player vendors - it’s fun to see how other people build their camps
---
* Throughout the session, I will plop down my survival tent and fast travel back to my camp to gather up my water to sell and deposit the scrap from my extractor/bot.
---
* If for some reason I’m still not done with dailies after a while, I’ll just go crank them out.  Sometimes I do this also if I don’t feel like playing or can’t play
---
* While doing this, I’ll often have the headset on and talking with my buddy. With public teams I’ve started to throw myself up with a team so people can benefit from shared perks and the public team, as well as maybe chat and make new connections.
---
This has worked pretty well for me, I’ll even write the goals down or notes on my iPad while I play.  My new goal is to start trying to attaching pictures to my notes.  It feels less grindy if I am making a memory out of it.
---
Edit: there are also days I just feel like doing mindless, repetitive stuff, so sometimes I’ll server hope one location and just farm XP/legendaries
---
Lol right because games aren't supposed to be fun or have achievable goals that don't suck away hours and hours of time.  This comment is laughable.
---
No developer is sitting in their chair, twirling their moustache and cackling with glee over designing a bad grindy game.  Not even at Bethesda.  
---
Generally anyone who makes anything for a living wants it to be experienced and appreciated by the audience they intend it for.  I think they just really have no inkling, sadly, of the ask that they're placing in front of the players.  How could they, when they aren't playing the game?
---
FYI, someone I know was furloughed for a week and was able to file for unemployment for that period of time and got the COVID bonus too.
---
Edit:// also wanted to add- I think because fallout fans are usually single player gamers, we are mostly just peaceful hermits who just wanna do our own thing. It's a pretty unique experience.
---
And how many pathetic tryhards are already level 700-800?
---
You see them all the time. Fucking good that those overpowered perks can't be maxed easily.
---
[removed]
---
This happened to me last night with the scorched queen. Whole group killed her, she fell, body disappeared into the ether. People were throwing up question mark emotes for 10 solid minutes.
---
That's my point. I want to want to. But I don't want to.
---
If you click on the game pass, go to view and manage subscriptions. It will bring up a browser with the subscriptions listed or go to your Microsoft account on a of and go to services and subscriptions
---
On a pc*
---
They're on the PTS and it's not a good look.
---
SCORE being auto completed in ruining this new thing for me.
---
I bought WoW gold once, like 8 years ago. Lol.
---
Im in favor of this and removing the stupid spoiled meat thing too.
---
nono youre a HATER if you report bugs and think they should be fixed
---
want the game to actually be fun instead of shitty RNG grind boom, ENTITLED ASSHOLE
---
want to have a discussion about game mechanics? COMPLAINER
---
its just sad
---
Not many people with the guts to help
---
Yeah I'm sorry.
---
I concur. It’s pretty rare when it happens to me but this is exactly what I’ve done to fix my problem (the restarting router and cold booting Xbox part - I’ve never had to clear the game data).
---
Correct, PVP is now handled individually.
---
They have us, thats why the Legendary perk grind seems like a sucker punch
---
Why delete? It takes no time to level. I gained 2 levels from one event. Also. If it takes you 3-4 hours to gain a level when in your hundreds then you're doing something very wrong in the game.
---
And once again. At the risk of sounding like a broken record. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. Nobody is forcing you.
---
It takes a bit of creativity, but you can do a military-style CAMP with the currently-available items. Here's some screenshots of a couple of mine that had a bunker/fortress style build.
---

THANK YOU
---
It happend to me, you gotta go cancel it in your microsoft account in the microsoft page.
---
Just happened to me with Camp Fire Tales. It didn't register me being there to do anything in the event. I even tried running off and back a few times. Sure, I could help kill stuff, but I got no quest pop up nor any reward.
---
oh no, there are too many things in the game to fix, give the devs of this very small and hardworking indie games studio a break! they fixed 2 bugs this month  you cant except them to fix any more of the year old game breaking bug thats just not humanly possible!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hozme8/fallout_76_gamepass_no_region_ping_fix/
---
Even modern military uses tents for semi-permanent camps. It's not a bad idea. Especially if you use defensive emplacements that are military-themed.
---
I have a two shot broadsider I've been holding onto for when they fix all the issues with explosives
---
Level 22 to 45 for me was literally just me going on supply runs, doing oddball side quests I'd find, and working on my camp/farm. Just had a stretch of like 30-50 hours right there of just taking in what the world had to offer and it was honestly pretty chill.
---
STOP COMPLAINING AND ONLY POST  ABOUT HOW GREAT EVERYTHING IS AND BUY MORE ATOM NOW!!!
---
🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
---
This is the fix that worked for me. Copying the .ini to games folder on my windows installed drive
---
Ouch
---
Exactly! I don’t play much, so I’m low level (14). I just recently cleared Morgantown Airport and the last room had a Legendary Ghoul. After I killed it, I went to do something else in that same room (loot the other ones, if I’m not mistaken) and when I came back, I couldn’t find it anymore
---
I had some similar happen the other day, but a bit different so I'm at my camp about to log off for the night when a level 13 shows up, now I typically like to give out some leveled gear for lower levels, but this guy just kept doing the gift icon making it clean that he was trying to get me to give him stuff, I was tired at that point so I dropped a thing of spoiled meat and watch him run to the bag to realize, he then continued to do the gift icon, so I just went to the bed got the xp bonus for the next time I logged on and signed off
---
Hell I'd even take it as a perk card
---
My guess: Bethesda put the NW challenges in there thinking no one would do them which would cost people progress and force them to buy atoms.  Then they saw a large amount of people were completing them, so they made them harder to complete.  The goal is to make you buy atoms to progress.
---
How did they ‘steal your loot’?
---
That's very similar to my experiance, until I find a grindy game I enjoy. At which point I go for completionest mode, gotta 100% collecting those golden turds, way too much time in breath of the wild
---
The game is still stealing my daily challenges, so I think I have a right to complain, even if Bethesda support doesn't care!
---
remember folks the frog dupe isnt real!
---
YES IT IS
---
🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸🐸
---
I have a glowing head what system do you play
---
Same here, container won't open. And no, grenades don't work hah
---
Yeah the project76.ini file? I copied that into the Fallout 76 in My Games under Documents. Still doesn't work.
---
I love this game, so much, and I want to do the season, but I just can't help feeling like it's work, I wake up and I'm like, time to do my dailies before anything else. The main problem is that I'm only level 35
---
Or you're not grinding. Building a base won't lvl me up quickly for example. Perhaps having lvl up as a daily requirement is a forceful way to put pressure on people to not do any of the relaxing things in the game that so many of us talk about as being the best parts of the game in this very subreddit.
---
Finding a way to exploit the challenges to min max - means the challenges are forcing you to play differently, which is exactly my point. can I lvl up in 6 minutes? Yup. But it's dumb as fuck, and shouldn't be a daily thing. 
---
Also I've already said I'm not doing them a bunch of times, and that the point is - if they made them fun, more people would play them. If they weren't almost all based on RNG, more people would play them, including me. The point is that I WANT motivation to play - and an MMO can't muster it.
---
That is a valid complaint.
---
I love nuclear winter and the challenges are great.
---
Not on this subreddit! It's all or nothing. Or murder!
---
While I think this is a great and fun idea, I'd rather them just put mailbox camp item for transferring things that acts as an account wide stash. They've already said that having more than one companion in camp is too much for the game to handle so I'd rather see them do more with actual allies then make it an either or situation.
---
You could just take the workshop, get the rewards for that.
---
Defend the workshop against monsters, which will attack almost immediately after taking the workshop, get the rewards for that.
---
And then if you see anyone in your workshop being all suspicious, fast travel elsewhere, and just let them have it.
---
Board game gives you enough atoms to buy the last 10 levels of those rewards interest you. So technically you can fall behind almost 2 weeks and still make it to 100.
---
Thanks for the info I will be giving this a shot
---
I did that today and I couldnt find it either
---
The bug where you can’t switch your weapon during SBQ is so bad. That needs to be fixed ASAP. Every new content drop the servers get worse, and lag is what causes most of the bugs.
---
Why is being level 35 a problem? There is so much more to do! Enjoy the game in your own way. You can put off the main quests and hunt challenges or you can just play and take whatever the challenges give you. Once it feels like work you’re not “playing” anymore.
---
When you drop it after you die
---
Doesn't work on my end. Just gotta wait for Bethesda to fix it next year
---
Thanks! I am okay with water and stims. It am just bitter lol
---
And the surviver ones!
---
That's beautiful
---
Same here but it really pisses me off that they keep giving power armor advantages to regular armor with none of the penalties. Even with Power User rank 3, I can see my fusion core deplete when I use a jet pack.  Secret service armor does  not require a fusion core. Using Jet Pack has no penalty at all.  
---
No, I don't think that SS armor should require fusion cores. Just get rid of the damn drain for those of us who have invested heavily in power user.  And get rid of the fusion core drain from VATS. Also, make the stealth boy mod function like chameleon armor.  As it is, stealth boy mode is temporary and consumes action points and when action points run out, stealth runs out.
---
I also have this problem. It's always inside sometimes if I hold the movement key long enough I move other times I'm stuck and have to fast travel.The thing is it's an ongoing problem that should have been fixed a year ago.
---
I built a solid size house when I first moved my camp at level 20ish. Then started camp hopping now in the 40+s and damn mine sucks. No wallpaper either
---
They are back already. Even worse then ever as far I can tell...
---
More than I got!
---
I would be happy if they just got rid of the damn fusion core drain from VATS and jet pack use.   It's insult added to injury now that we have regular armor that can use jet pack with no power source.
---
Bethesda always have been, the community always used to be the one doing the bug fixes!
---
Tldr Make them glow like the scrap spotter perk in fallout 4
---
Yup, I've drunk nuka shine as a new player. Ended up at some tight rope and ended getting pushed off by some enemy
---
I thought that white knight only applied to power armor?
---
Those are glitched too?? I didn’t know actually because I got the Survivor ones when they were live in May. Damn ... I wish they would glitch the VTU rewards, I’m trying to build a frat house lol
---
Yeah, I always look for that first when doing the legendary dailies. Other times I jump on it when nobody looks like they are gonna do it, then I drop the drops on a low level camp. No sense in letting them go to waste.
---
Had that happen to me too
---
I made to the end and all the npcs were naked and unclickable.. I had to Ctrl Alt Del, and when i came back i had to do the quest again.. I noticed they coded in the removal of 1000 gold but can't be bothered to code in a save point at the lift...
---
Should state your system.
---
I already had them too, but my friend recently unlocked the ghilie suit so seems so!
---
The winter jacket is impossible to get though, got everything else but man that's far too much xp to get that!
---
I'll be on in a sec, gonna get a shower and I'll be on
---
Yeah a good mod for the arms would be weapon weight reduce
---
It works. It lowers the cost. Fix it good will also raise the durability. That works on power armor and base armor the card is worded a little odd.
---
I remember seeing people wish death upon the developers over a cheap nylon bag.
---
Ahh... Well I'm not that good at the game so probably won't slow me down if you ever feel like to join please let me know 😊
---
I have a bunch. Looking for mats, primarily.
---
How did you die?
---
post it and if it gets removed it's not allowed
---
do a few dailies and they'll love you again. but you did miss out on a few exlcusive rewards.
---
Gimme a moth man vending machine and I’ll do it too lol.
---
The worst thing is until recently, the cryolator barrel used to work, the broadsider was just broken from launch!
---
There is an evil robot herding brahman. You see him, you head for the hills unless you're prepared to fight. If he gets a chance to tell you how dangerous it is to be out there all alone it's too late- the sheepsquatch is there.
---
Oh my bad
---
i used to try and rush through 76 and get the best legendaries and best armor to clear through the game fast. If i could go back, i would 100% take more time doing everything. Recently i’ve slowed things down and enjoyed the grind for an optimal shotgun build. Yesterday i picked up my dream weapon, the TSE Pump Shotgun. That thing was a beast in late 2018 and early 2019 and i’ve always wanted to get my hands on one and yesterday it finally happened. Sure it may not be the strongest in 76 now but it still does really good base damage and it gets even better with the build i’m running with some physco. I’ve also moved my camp and took time building it and i really enjoy what i did. I miss the older state of 76 when i was like level 40 back in december 2018 where everything was so new. I now know for a fact that i should’ve taken my time because after i reached level 60 i got bored, and didn’t play for a long time. a few months ago i got back into the game and i’ve been having a blast with all the new content. Just today i reached level 96 (kinda sad because i started playing a few weeks after launch, but that proves that rushing things makes everything boring)
---
I didn't google it, I have played the game enough to know where safes are.  And I got lucky when I spawned there.  Nobody was there for whatever reason. Which is another thing that pisses me off about these challenges: they have nothing to do with skill and rely more on luck.
---
Because it cost $200 to get the cheap nylon bag.
---
PS4 btw
---
Doesn’t matter to an outfit that is selling for cash. Having accounts banned is the price of business. Besides, they can buy new accounts fairly cheaply or even by another players login info for less and use that account.
---
Especially with robots and them needing to explode when you kill them
---
Alien blaster was useless in 4 too! But yes all the rest got nerfed into the ground!
---
send a message on the xbone and i'll come on
---
Well... I dont know about that, I dont want to get like a strike or something.
---
Doing it for the raiders, I had to restart it 3 of 4 times because there was a bug where they'd stop talking and the quest wouldn't progress :)
---
A companion app would be an awesome feature...im all for it...but knowing this game...people will probably figure out a way to dupe items using said app. 😅😭😅😂 duping on the go will be the new fad...mark my word.
---
Or was it $300? See the point?
---
I understand you man, try to make them as you can; I hope the next ones are "easy". 
---
If they are too hard just leave the 250 points, its ok. I hope bethesda help you or any other fellow gamer.
---
Are you in PC? I would love to help you complete them
---
I read this statement frequently lately.
---
Where is the point implementing new stuff to the game when everyone who is concerned he/she can't beat the time gate should straight quit trying from beginning? Why play the game in the first place, since it is a "game as a service"  (tbh that's just a lazy excuse to release it in alpha state and leave it broken for years)?
---
And who are you or anyone else telling someone to ignore new features that were implemented on purpose and got advertised?
---
No one have to do anything ingame, I could also tell anyone who is concerned or frustrated from any aspect of any game to just quit gaming at all. This is not arguing, it's just a really bad punchline without any substance or possibility to take it serious.
---
What do you need
---
Alien blaster was decent for low levels
---
How much do you need?
---
At least 20
---
Get a pipe weapon, shoot things, fix it cheap, repeat.
---
I thought it didn't spawn until late game, or was I always unlucky on triggering that random event.
---

It just lazy designing to control player progressions
---
1. We can only equip 6 legendary perks slots at a time ,  we should be able to max rank them all at a reasonable time... maxing all legendary perks is where the grind is 
---
2. With the current system after lvl50 players will choice a perk card just to scrap it.. and repeat  , every 5 lvl the perk card pack will scrap. The Ability to choose a park card option will be pointless 
---
3. The upcoming perk loadout system to run multi builds will also be pointless because player will scrap EVERY ADDITIONAL perks card for coins
---
I literally go around doing things and stuff and gain a poop load of xp. 
---
And once again. At the risk of sounding like a broken record. You don't have to do anything you don't want to. **Nobody is forcing you**.

Thought i would bold it in case you missed that part. Don't wanna level? Don't. The world will keep turning.
---
Sounds like that would be considered a looking for group type of post, which are allowed :) if you go to the main page on r/Fo76 and click About there's a list of the rules
---
$60 for the game, $140 for the helmet. The bag and other things were free. (yes, I understand they showed a different bag in the original picture, I'm just trolling now)
---
I’m saying don’t go griping and insisting you well never pay them. You sound like an asshole that does not deserve to be taken seriously. You have valid criticisms but defeat yourself with your choice of words. Like when you work a customer service job and when someone says “I will never do business with you again!” And you roll your fucking eyes and think “bye Felicia”
---
Mostly steel and lead
---
No, I figured ide morale style it after like a recruitment add or something
---
I build my shops behind windows with huge glowing letters so you have to be blind to not see them. I also used the most common spawn point as a fix point to build my base facing that point
---
This also works for me - thanks so much for sharing, OP.
---
Overall I am very happy with Gamepass for PC, but it is frustrating how I consistently seem to have issues when installing games on drives that aren't my Windows install.
---
Weird, I did it once. Never again, seems boring....
---
It could finish a deathclaw quickly so it was useful to get one out of the way
---
I don't think they have strikes. 
---
I had a post deleted where i was giving stuff away for some reason. No strike or anything.
---
(50 day necro im sorry) did you ever find a fix for this?  it just happened to me and i feel dirty using it
---
Just as someon had done for me when I was low level, I have been handing out all the extra sets of power armor I have been hording. Just this mourning I gave my last two sets of lv 25 to a pair of players who were in the ash region
---
&gt;  I want them to suffer as we have suffered.
---
Gamer truly is the most oppressed race, when will our oppressors set our chains free?
---
If you have oil, I have copper.
---
I hear you on that, I am still grinding for the winter jacket. I’ve been playing NW every night! Maybe I’ll finally get it this weekend. I’m too much of a completionist to give up on it.
---
But you don’t have to get all 100 things to get a lot of fun stuff out of the chase.  There are fun rewards all across the board. 
---
It goes to people’s motivations I guess, but not everyone needs to complete every challenge in order to enjoy an hour or two of escape into a fantasy world.
---
good lord, your original post wasn't sarcasm?
---
Lone Wanderer and Travel Agent are the only perks I use, so I only have 5 Charisma points. I can't share more than one perk at rank 1. Before this event with teams, I didn't need to be part of a team.
---
I switch out Lone Wanderer with Magnetic Personality and Squad Maneuvers. I don't know what to share anyway. 
---
I would absolutely love to respec into a Charisma heavy build, but I can't. Because Bethesda doesn't believe in respecs. 
---
Then again, I invested 15 points in STR and INT, so that's my fault.
---
Yeah, this game makes some of the most hamfisted attempts at keeping players on the hook I've seen outside of mobile gatcha games.  Spending all my time navigating around one artificial roadblock after another just sapped my desire to play.  
---
Games like FFXIV and Path of Exile know that many of their players take breaks from their games, and are fine with that.  They know they have a game that people want to come back to, and they've got content dropping frequently enough to keep them happy.  
---
Games like Fallout 76 don't have that mentality and it shows.  It's like they're deathly afraid of players being, "done", for any length of time because they have no confidence that they'll ever come back.  So they're just focused on making everything as long and tedious as possible, fun be damned.
---
PC.
---
It brings tears of joy to my eyes....
---
Same for me on PS4. Haven’t played all week
---
Yes they added 6 slots that already on itself is a limit.  Your correct the game isn’t meant for everyone to have everything but 6 out of 16 legendary perks isn’t “everything”
---
Love it. You feel like you're doing a job. It should be harder though. And they need to come up with some similar escort missions.
---
Going and going and going....
---
Yeah, i somehow did this glitch without even knowing.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXR2diJEnFA
---
Is there a mod to show you which ones you have listened to? That's the only reason I don't get them anymore... Seems I get the same ones all the time
---
This sub is not for bartering. If someone wants to donate copper, that’s fine. But arranging exchanges is not allowed.
---
Wished it was on the same level of difficulty as Radiation Rumble.
---
Fuckin saaaaaame
---
Nukashine is how my over encumbered wandering trader gets around!
---
It works even though the chinese stealth armor is considered a special hazmat suit? I didnt think that it was counted as armor.
---
What’s the trick to leveling in less than 3 hours when your in your hundreds? Cranberry relish/tasty squirrel stew, inspiration perk lvl 3, strange in numbers perk, building group, brain bombs, scorched beast brains, berry mentats. What am I missing? I’m not using mutations that take away strength.
---
People are missing the point here.   People are not fixing 10 items because they need to be fixed. They are fixing them because the daily challenge said to. I repaired 10 weapons that had maybe 10 percent damage.  They didn't even need fixing, but I fixed them because the challenge log said I had to to make progress. 
---
So we are having to consume resources to repair gear that really doesn't need repairs.
---
Throw-away accounts are mostly used by hackers using 3rd party tools to inject files into the fo76.exe inside the ram.
---
A public dupe like this now will mostly used by main accounts, since it's pretty easy and alot of people who are not used to these 3rd party software usage don't have it on their mind to use a burner account. Also, these accounts need cash, for ps4 or xbox most of the users will simply use their only main account.
---
Alot of ppl are banned yet, way more then back in the days with the vendor dupe exploit or any other dupe exploit without any tools.
---
Drop a friend request and join me. I’ll hook you up. PSN is the same as here.
---
Cranberry mentats should be XP boost
---
When i ses high levels go into my camp, i leave world quickly, instakill. My camp is underground, so i spend part of my hanging near my camp showing low levels how to get in.
---
Sounds like someone is jealous. 
---
Stamina is key, friend.
---
Agree
---
And going and going and going....
---
I’m sorry but if I ask for copper on any trading subreddit, it won’t work, all anyone’s looking for is legacy’s, fixers or handmades, that’s just my opinion.
---
Sorry ps4
---
Because that would lessen the grind and make it easier for you. Not a joke not sarcasm.
---
YOURE WRONG, BUT ILL UP VOTE YOUR BRAVERY.
---
Srsly though, it is boring if you’re hanging by the jokers with the cows. 
---
Enemy spawns are scripted so while the jokers with the cows are dragging their feet you can sprint to grab the optional supplies
---
The optional supplies only spawn in a couple designated locations and they’re easy to remember.
---
I have noticed that the more people joining the event creates a larger enemy spawn pool and more opportunities for legendaries.
---
I hope you try it again!
---
Sorry but you are the dick since the beggining, defending exploiters, but maybe you are one yourself ?  
---
But, well, since nobody seems to care about that  I guess the community is actually declining for good.
---
It did fix itself, i think the magazine size was about 2000
---
💯
---
I think the reason there’s a combat meta guide for everything is more problematic than that.  Min-Maxing culture in every single game despite it’s design is the reason the industry has become a service model.  Confidence and originality are out the window, which makes sense in some games, not so much others.  That then leads to the culture of constant complaints about not having enough to do.  Folks just skip to dessert then complain another meal isn’t being served quick enough.
---
While I completely understand where you’re coming from—I don’t have the vision, reflexes or twitch shooting ability a may have once had either—there is an alternative to the NW challenges. It’s there for everybody. 
---
Do the repeatable XP challenge 3 times. You’ll get 300 SCORE, more than you would’ve in NW. I know 10,000 XP looks like a huge number, but it really isn’t. At least not for anyone who can fight high level enemies. If you do some dedicated XP grinding for the same amount of time those NW challenges would’ve taken, you’ll definitely hit it 3 times. If you push that to 4 times, you’ll make up the difference that the NW weekly challenge offered too. 
---
Saying this not to be critical, just to offer a solution that might help.
---
I stopped wearing armor to save on space, i just keep my PA all the time. I need to just max out 5 and 10 lvl stuff to hand out when I see them. I usually invite them into my camp and make them something on the spot they are either missing or is to unnderpowered.
---
Would be cool, I'm only afraid hacker or people nearby can use it to grief you.
---
I’m down by fissure prime.
---
Ok
---
To my understanding, AA adds roughly 29% damage while Two-Shot by itself adds 15%-25%.
---
If you have the choice between just AA, just TS, and just Explosive Bullets plus some random mediocre prefix like Ghoul Slayer’s or Troubleshooter’s, Explosive will most likely deal the most bonus damage because you can further buff that damage with Demolitions Expert in INT.
---
Two-Shot used to deal two bullets at 100% damage, but now I believe only the first bullet deals 100% and the second 25%.
---
Breathing techniques can help. Exercise is good as well. Talking about expectations with your partner is very important.
---
uh oh, here come the salty downvotes! better duck and cover.
---
Absolutely, though is suck at radiation rumble. I just sit on the D and hope someone is collecting Uranus 
---
I don’t know if you’ve dried The Elder Scrolls Online. But they have a veteran dungeon system where once you’ve reached a certain level you can queue for the same dungeons, but it’s an entirely different much harder game play. FO76 would benefit similarly to this.
---
And going and going and going...
---
Use a cheaper gun!
---
They can only drop from the purveyor if you learn the plan. They never drop from mobs.
---
I'm not very materialistic anyways ;)
---
Tried TESO*
---
There's a double SCORE daily AND a double exp "weekend" coming up. Both should give you plenty of opportunities to catch up. We also haven't heard anything about whether Public Events should actually be giving out SCORE to my knowledge. If it's a bug that gets fixed that should make things a lot easier too.
---
Either way the grind is not as bad as people are making it out to be, and even if you can't do it it's not like you're entitled to completing it. It's supposed to be something to work for (unless you're paying to skip ahead).
---
I mean, Bethesda did say that each rank in the beginning would be around 1 hour, and around 2 later on. So far, that’s stayed pretty true. At least for me.
---
Clearly you're incapable of reading at all. All I did was show up to provide info and you've been nothing but a whiny bitch. Have a good one.
---
I think there is a difference between carrying and helping. Setting a low price for decent gear isnt carrying, walking with a noob and blasting through their quests is. 
---
A little help makes for nicer players in the long run, carrying makes for short term players.
---
Have you seen a doctor about that?  Seems you have a bit of a tic.
---
Works, thank you big time!
---
Same. After about a minute all the spinning around the corners makes me say "I'm too drunk for this shit." Then move on.
---
I’m assuming it will double it, since meat stew from feed the people event I get 10% instead of the base 5%. Haven’t tried it yet though
---
And going and going and going.....
---
You can ask for copper. You can’t engage in trades here. 
---
This is per the sub’s rules. It’s not personal.
---
Are you grinding for xp or playing casual?
---
That's literal. Either you're a poor troll, or you don't realize that to get the bag Cost paying for the Power Armor edition of the game, which was $200. The complaints about the nylon bag also weren't that it was nylon, it's that the advertising for the product said it was Canvas.
---
No one is gonna buy a silk shirt, find out it's cloth - then shrug it off.
---
Not op but I do drunk buy atoms. "Oh wow a dancing robot. Look at that sweet deal."
---
I’m more concerned about the legendary enemies falling through the ground and not being able to loot them. But marking them would also be extremely useful.
---
No I'm saying clearing the reserved data will fix it instead of rebooting everything but I hate losing my pics every time
---
How do I send a message, like a group post?
---
Just got them thanks
---
No exchanging Guns is what you mean?
---
Troll to troll. You get exactly why people were legit upset.
---
I've been grinding for weeks and just have one piece left for the t65 power armor. It pretty much guarantees that I will play everyday. They knew full well what they were doing.
---
Also only 68 percent of players have left the vault
---
That’s not how you use ellipses. 
---
[This could help. ](https://youtu.be/JmRMfFVw6NE)
---
Yes I understood what you meant. My comment is that I’ve not had to do that. The router reboot and Xbox cold boot have worked each time. Thanks for the info!
---
Just do as you do. Keep your head up and all will be well.
---
i enjoy it? i’m just saying i had a cool interaction in nuclear winter?
---
oh boy i got a long way to go then.  i appreciate the answer, time to burn off some ammo
---
Maybe you accidentally blocked him, had the same issue today and this was the result.
---
Still going! Nothing outlasts the Energizer Bunny, he keeps going and going...
---
No. You cannot engage in trading or bartering here. This is not a trade subreddit. 
---
Someone donating something is kind of borderline at best. 
---
Exchanging oil for copper is a trade. It’s not allowed here.
---
You got that right, kid!
---
I have a lot of steel not much lead
---
It's almost as if gaming companies are corporations running under capitalism.
---
They're not blending in. They're falling through the world.
---
I don't know how people cant find the entrance to my camp. I literally have a billboard with arrows pointing down
---
Alright I won’t do that someone else offered to donate some to me
---
But when I want so? It doesn't matter if rank 10 or 100, why implementing it and don't want the player to achieve it? 
---
Why beat the main story, when the plot is clear one mission before? 
---
Why nuke rift prime when you don't want to defeat the queen or even use the nuke site for flux?
---
if we would be able to reach rank 100 even if we're not active every day for 3months doing all challenges, wouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we shit on Bethesda's roof to change it? The double score event is their first response to exactly this concern. 
---
Or, just tell everyone it's ok to not take advantage of content and ignore it.
---
There must be more to this bug than just being logged off before the reset. I am seeing far too many people having this issue who are aware of that particular aspect, and that many different players aren't all bending the truth about their actions, because that wouldn't make any sense at all. 
---
There's obviously more to the cause, and it must be quite infuriating considering the legendary run is the only real new content at the minute and they're saying there's no way they can award it after the fact/bug. 
---
I've never had a single issue with it, but I can't for the life of me think what I'm doing everyone else isn't or vice versa. It's really not on.
---
YOOOOOOO this actually works! Easy way to get to the ini file and copy it is click the [3 dots next to play](https://i.imgur.com/uMJtp7Q.png), moddable folder, copy the ini file from there. It wouldn't let me copy the ini file the normal way. Kept saying I needed permission etc.
---
Then I just pasted it in the My Game &gt; Fallout 76 folder. Set it to Read Only under properties and it worked.
---
Your argument is poor, repetitive, and entirely off topic. No one is complaining that it's hard to do any of those things. I'm complaining that the list of things to do is a pile of arbitrary shit that doesn't add anything positive to the game.
---
"Sweet - finally a reason to repair mole miner gauntlets" said no one ever.
---
And you've said it multiple times so far, I can only assume because you didn't read at any point along the way when I said I AM NOT DOING THE  CHALLENGES. I just wish I wanted to, because it would only required the cognition of a toddler on sleeping meds to adjust them into motivating goals.
---
Mine stopped launching, and I had to repair/reset the game through the Windows Settings (Apps &amp; Features &gt; Fallout76 &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Reset / Repair). Game Pass made me have to "reinstall" it, which hiccuped, and I had to run WSReset in command prompt (resets the Windows Store cache), try installing again, and then it would open.  I hope this helps some, at least with it not launching. This way you don't need another 75GB on your cap.
---
**EDIT: This fixed launching for me: Follow the instructions from LadyDevann (Copy the file "Project76.ini" from this folder "D:\Program Files\ModifiableWindowsApps\Fallout 76\" to your "My Games\Fallout 76" folder. Start the Game. Note: The Project76.ini will be on the drive you installed the game on. The example above assumes it was installed on the "D" drive.) BUT also for the one in your My Documents\My Games\Fallout 76 ALSO go into its properties and make it read-only. That fixed it for me.
---
&gt; controversy
---
You mean how it had gay people it in it? Yeahhhh I wouldn't call that a controversy. All the review bombs are from a bunch of angry nerds who review bombed the fuck out of the game minutes after it came out.
---
Same when sleeping on roofs!
---
I moved up here bc everyone is on that pond by the train station lol. Be sure to visit if you ever see me. I'll make you some corn soup before you leave.
---
Enjoy the copper.
---
We have checked that
---
That's... Something
---
That was fun to watch! Did you have a reference pic or did you draw from memory?
---
Legendary sheepsquash
---
are you on now?
---
Yes because they expect a fallout game and your stupid immersion breaking build with your fortnite costume and dancing is probably souring their opinion.
---
Thank you, that’s way more than I expected but still thanks
---
Sounds like you found my camp. Sorry bud. Just play the banjo and it lets you in.
---
Yes, I didn’t even think the armor! One piece or another has been braking almost every time I leave my camp. Oh and my weapons too! I used an improved repair kit to fix up my gun right as I spawned at scorched earth, and I had to repair it again a little more than half way through. I used to be able to get through a whole SBQ fight on a single repair, not two.
---
We do it to ourselves.
---
Yes
---
Okay but it made me sad to know I spent 500 well earned atoms on the Slocum Joe vendor.... without realizing you only get 90% of the sale... am big sad
---
Thank you! Some people’s camps it’s like their mission to make it difficult for you to find their vendors.
---
I always forget to eat my relish and it goes off. My inspiration is 2. I do run in a building group but often people don't join. i just do things and stuff. And then i level up. I don't set out to grind xp or anything.
---
Lol, I got lucky and found one. Just kept spawning there. Today's stimpack one was less of a chore since I could get a couple and fall off a cliff and stimpack myself.
---
I have....lots.
---
As someone who just got this game a few days ago and is running melee, I fucking wish I could just sell all my ammo. At least 1/3 of my stash is filled with something I am never going to use.
---
Mine are the first room, under ground. I dont like being normal and if you cant play a banjo, then why am I selling. Haha
---
That is exactly how mine looked today. Not a single difference. The same one of three legendary’s already killed. I just got an auto response saying they can’t do anything about it.
---
When would recently be? It was broken in all the tests I did months before wastelanders
---
I think I would go insane if there was a rating system
---
Your RNG was nice. Too me 4 hours to get 7. Then 1 hour more to get two in different matches. Both of the last being Grafton monsters so I had to unload all my ammo on them.
---
Thanks I'm glad you liked it :P All from memory, do you think I Should try using a reference next time?
---
Rank 90 will take more then 3000 score, good luck!
---
Also 2mm ec is cheaper and easier to make than most ammos. bit of lead. bit of steel. PEW PEW!
---
Especially if you're being attacked by a horde of something,but one's a legendary. I can guarantee that the one i can't find after the furballs over,is the legendary. And if you're using energy guns where they ash or slime, it's worse.
---
Nah I love camps that are locked or have no entrance. I always try to get inside by using an object near a window so I can drop an item. Just something to let them know they had a visitor.
---
Stop by mine. I have a cutout for the entrance, from there you are on your own.
---
I say we take off and Nuke the entire site from orbit.
---
Just stop if you don't enjoy the activity. Why are you forcing you?
---
Maybe you just need imagination. I love this game for that. I think a fun way of doing the challenges and enjoy. Like the challenge for collect wood... I could roam the forest, but no. I roam Cranberry bog and Savage Divide. It take me 40 minutes: subfusils were broken,  hundreds of 10mm / .45 ammo used, but get 3 legendaries, a level up, a good stress relief killing high level enemies and plenty of items to sell and scrap.
---
Also, just doing event after event is fun for a while and get you a lot of XP. I am at 20 in the legendary run, but don't play often (3-5 days/week), and sometimes for just 1 hour. Maybe tomorrow I can be done with the weeklies and after get 60k XP doing events. I would love playing more but I alsoneed enjoy real life.
---
Maybe I don't get to 100 but I sure get fun with the legendary run.
---
Mines underground, not locked. You have to play the banjo to glitch through the floor.
---
This is the one bad thing about settlement building and camps. I have no creativity. I can build a square with a roof and sometimes it doesn't look like crap.
---
I got banned for trolling, lasted two weeks.
---
They do something at least, if it's a tutorial to exploit or cheat I highly assume op will get banned.
---
Exactly. I'm im the same boat. I just find it sad some people are so entitled that they'd bitch and moan because they can't devalue someone else's work and achievements. Also if you spend a good day grinding out exp you can get quite a lot of ranks quickly. I feel like even a weekend player taking an hour a day to do the dailies and a few hours per weekend grinding out level could hit 100 with time to spare.
---
Most mmos and league require -extreme- time sinks to get the best rewards and there are no other ways to get them.
---
something something duplication something?
---
Cool just got on gotta make a steel run will be ready in a bit. GT TitanUp323.
---
Haven’t found any. But there is a great little spot just south of spruce lake (by foundation) where you can build a 3x2 between 2 cliffs and have the front right on the water front. I built there last month. Put the generator on the top cliff and ran wires to the house. Built a dock. It was nice.
---
Not sure you can use abuse exploits and play fairly in the same sentence...
---
I had this issue after heart of the swamp? Forest? Whatever its called. I stood around and waited for the flies and got two legendary 1* for my trouble.
---
Here is my strongly worded letter.
---
That would bring back bad memories of "kill 10 people in a single match" from Fortnite. Got very very lucky in 1 match because I know I wasn't that good. That particular grind was horrible.
---
The nuclear winter ones definitely are
---
Now that sounds like wayyyyyyyy too much logic, get out of here!
---
How about just 100% of the time they turn into meat piles?  Those buzzing flies are like my magazine perk.
---
Same here, my alt char had this problem with ac three times till it worked the 4th time.
---
When Bethesda's bugs screw us over so severely, and Bethesda support refuses to help, you've got to turn somewhere,
---
That happened to me with the 1st day's challenge. Wish that had happened to me with the "kill animals" one.
---
Best way to enjoy a game, visit the games specific subreddit rarely. According to every subreddit of every game I play they are all terrible and everyone is doing a terrible job.
---
Oh. My. God. Does Uvtha actually play the game? How dare they find enjoyment in a gameplay style which you do not. What an asshole.
---
Man 3 is such a great point. They are testing new content that will totally stunt future content.
---
I'm not doing them, cause no one is forcing me, and the challenge isn't motivating. The explanations of how people are managing the tedium isn't the point. The point is that it's tedium. We were given tedium as a content releases main feature.
---
I am at 24 in the legendary run, because I enjoy the game, but the challenges are just hot pokers saying "don't do what you like - do this"
---
Oh, so you didn’t stash your junk before going adventuring. 
---
You’ve learned your lesson, then. 
---
No one stole anything from you. They claimed abandoned property. They claimed their salvage rights.
---
It's less about RNG and more about knowing where the spawns are.
---
I have seen a video on here of someone's camp with a waterfall in the camp but I don't remember where it was.  South of top of the world there is a camp with a rocky River going down that sounds really nice.  Also an acid node nearby.
---
Yea I’ve played a little eso and saw the option for the higher leveled characters but never strived to go for it as I’m just not an elder scrolls fan, so most of the lore and story flew over my head, leading me to lose interest.
---
That one always cracks me up.
---
Slight problems
---
1. Having been on these forums since BETA, based on the results these forums get, there is now way on god's green earth that the whales hang and post on here. They'd be ripped apart. Participation is nice, but it's not money, nor does it really end in more money in a game like this where you don't need crammed servers to maintain player membership (which loops back into the lack of PVP effort, which DOES rely on crammed servers)
---
2. 76 is almost two years old now. It's old news. At this point, they're not trying to gain income through sales because anyone who would play has already bought it. Their goal has transitioned into making money with current users. Hence, the change from daily atoms to the challenge system, which while rewarding lacks control on the rewards and requires serious effort... or cash.  This means that under-performing aspects, like NW, will be maintained but not enhanced (you note we've heard not a squeak about new maps since Morgantown, yeah?).
---
Any reason as to why?
---
Lol, got to the top 5 in one today, and finally, at that point, a grafton monster and a scorchbeast (as usual) spawned. Won my first match today.
---
Sir this is an Arbys.
---
Right but if 1000 score for the beginning challenges is 1 hour, you'd think 2000 score would be roughly 2 hours. If it continues past 2k you're increasing the time.
---
Valley Galleria + Red Rocket Mega Stop.. Finished lol. Great idea, would be fun!
---
I guess instanced CAMP gonna be in whitespring, hopefully they gonna add this because 3 loading screen is too much
---
In that moment when treasury notes could be shared they’d be intensively duped. 🤪
---
Im the opposite. Some days I just point in a direction and start walking. I never make it to the end of the map because I just keep wandering from there. No quest on the screen, no dailies, nothing as a target. Just know someone needs killing and they are on my path. 
---
I know its fun both ways, but falllout to me will always be that meandering and walking. I am level 74 and just got around to finishing the main story line.
---
This is one of the reasons why I don't put up a vendor at my camp. I'm trying to keep its location discreet &amp; frankly, don't wanna deal with lower level players who think PvP is high reward. I'm a level 203 now. I remember when I was like a level 80, three lower levels, no higher than like 20, attacked me. I had PA on too &amp; well, I thought I could take them. I did. Destroyed them &amp; then continued on my quests. They came back again, died &amp; then left me alone. I felt good. Haha.
---
I am in total shock. They act like Todd has a gun to their head.
---
People actually getting banned for duping? I don’t have anything worth it, but I’m curious to know.
---
oh i know the feeling just hit rank 51 so im at 2250 now blahh lol
---
get a room you two
---
I’ve lost so many legendaries from that damn invisible goat
---
There is a waterfall along the creek that runs just East/Southeast of Pleasant Valley.
---
There’s a waterfall in the Mire near the Crashed Plane
---
Same here, everything just blends into each other and it's a struggle to find anything. Cranberry bog is the worst
---
3 lol
---
There's 3 different sets of merchant/guards with different dialogue.. worth it just to hear the banter.
---
^^let's ^^get ^^a ^^*mooooooove* ^^on..
---
You mean you don’t understand the 100,000 years worth of history?!! DID YOU NOT FECKIN READ EVERY BOOK YOU CAME ACROSS! 
---
I’M DONE WITH YOU!
---
Just think of it functionally and maybe something will pop up to you. Like maybe adding a bathroom, or a porch upstairs. Not sayingthis would put you on that same level, but starting small and working your way forward is the only way to improve.
---
Anticheat system in PUBG🤔 is it joke?
---
they cant even make the game worth if you install it on any drive except the same one as the OS, i dont think Bethesda has programmers smart enough to make crossplay work
---
A good troll would never actually say they were trolling.
---
In my original response, I was agreeing with you, it's very all or nothing or murder here. But, The furor over the bag lasted a good 6 months, it obviously still makes people mad. I doubt the devs themselves made the decision to have the bags made of nylon and it's not the "Canvas Bag Edition" after all, I'm sure it saved a few dollars per unit and some board meeting happened. Which ended up costing them a lot more than just sending out the canvas ones.
---
Its a bit troubling tbh. I wont be doing todays either. Thats 3 NW in a row Ive missed. I was OK with killing 3 creatures but 9 was ridiculous. It feels like they are pushing players hard to spend more time in it. Im hoping if I get another overseer rank itll count to the weekly total and finish that for me. Some of the other NW challenges are counting from anecdotal evidence at least
---
agreed. the pacing issues that events normally have is mitigated by the banter between the NPCs. Eugenie and Kieran are my favorite.
---
The nuclear winter challenges (totally separate) work for the legendary run daily. Today for instance was using 6 stimpaks. I played 3 rounds, used one stimpak but completed 3 other NW challenges (fuck knows what they were) and completed that aspect and also the weekly. 
---
I have no desire to play NW even though I don't hate it as a game mode, but 1000 score is a lot to miss out on when I'm now at the point it's taking 2k a level.
---
It appears they're trying to vary up the challenges in some ways, but it doesn't help matters. It's still basically a chore and will never really be enjoyable when the only reason for doing them is the legendary run. No involvement or anything it's just a means to an end and you can't make that what it isn't fundamentally.
---
Can confirm it doesn't for that exact reason.
---
Allegedly. On the other hand, you wont have trouble finding 1000 anecdotal posts from people who say they witnessed it and see the player a week later. I can attest to knowing several active dupers in-game and people I have added from trading who made it clear they are actively exploiting and I can say I saw some of them today. They have also allegedly banned innocent users who happen to just pick up duped items without realizing.
---
She hates everyone.
---
Now I am purposely going to have 10 damaged gear in my stash. ALSO repair kits count!
---
It's funny considering i just fast traveled to a "shop" and could never find the actual vendor, looked outside the house, went around the house and nothing. Inside, was locked but the door upstairs was opened, nothing inside, nothing on top as well. I gave up and gave him a thumbs down :c
---
While I like the idea, I hate how unlike other issues, customer support lock your support tickets and refuse to even talk to you if you have a problem with it.
---
Well clearing the reserved space takes like 5 seconds vs rebooting everything
---
I disagree. Creativity stems from limitations. You COULD cram every last plan into your camp... and it'll be a fugly, depressing mess. Limitations make you choose carefully and plan ahead, instead of a giant 20x20x10 cube of walls crammed with identical bedrooms. A bigger canvas does not make a better painting.
---
The only thing I agree with above is the display items. Displays themselves take a chunk of budget, and then a chunk for each item as well (and an apparently large chunk at that). Feels a little disproportionate.
---
I heard there's a really nice waterfall near the flower icon in the NE portion of the map. I know for sure there's one a little south east of the crashed plane in the mire
---
They can't or you'd notice they fell off the fucker bit map.
---
Way worser
---
Hate that, but what to do? Some are way too needy.
---
No o didn’t, thanks for asking though
---
Morgantown Locked in the Closet is too.
---
Works over here for both my wife and myself. As /u/lukeLOL said set the properties of the .ini to read only after you copy it and you should be golden.
---
I'm sure that's true - and I'm also sure when more ignorant types say "devs" they're more often referring to Bethesda as a company. The devs probably want to fix this stuff, and likely can't get the time allocated on their sprints to do but work. If we always take DEV, and assume it means "Todd's Evil Corp." Then everything will make more sense.
---
Btw - I have both bags. They're both stupid but it felt good to get what I paid for (except the game. That still sucked)
---
I like the outfit and gas mask you can get. I finally got an extra gas mask
---
My rebooting takes about 2 minutes and - most importantly - I don’t have to lose the photos on my Xbox. I back my photos up anyway but I still enjoy seeing my old favorites on load screens.
---
Go modify ur weapons with different mods from each other that should fix the problem it did with me.
---
Seeing as the wall mounted cabinet, which has been bugged since launch, was (sort of) fixed only in the last patch then this timescale seems to line up. By the time it was addressed, nobody even cared anymore.
---
Her cow jokes got me the first time. There is definitely good voice acting here that help expand the universe a bit. Big fan!
---
It's inexcusable for them to keep locking peoples support tickets and refusing to offer help!
---
Slow down. Holy crap. You are like 30 levels behind where you should be.
---
Thats nothing, could have just asked for help with rebuilding and I definitely would have helped.
---
.. except BadCompanySarge on YouTube...he gets all the Fixers
---
Now I know what a rundown is lol
---
Wait so you are telling me people can't criticize the game for it's flaws but you can criticize people for their opinions? Absolute mad lad
---
Xb1? I can give a hand with building.
---
23 is mighty low for belly of the beast my friend.
---
Like I dont mind helping out new people but typically its random people not some guy beggin
---
I mean, what would you do here though? Environmental story telling and lore are finite. Unless the game is meant to end, and service games aren't, there has to be something else. Slot machine gear and min maxxers are what keeps your playerbase alive so some things have to be designed with them in mind. And not everyone plays that way anyway, it's mostly what you see here, sure, but that's because people on the sub are largely your number squeezers. Casual players don't care about 10% damage increase and there are a lot more of them than there are of us.
---
Mines is K1 Shockwave
---
This is why I'm not getting too frustrated with the current duping of God tier weapons. 90% of players who aquire these weapons will quit through boredom in a few weeks, taking most of their OP gear with them. Meanwhile I'll keep puttering along, doing this and that, taking my wins when I get 'em.
---
I know I'm taking my time. I'm carrying over 900lbs of supplies, I have to walk everywhere.
---
On my new character I got to level 50 before starting any of the main quests, I wanted maxed out unique rewards.
---
Bunch of people got banned for duping yesterday. Dupe wasn't even out that long.
---
You have any airship ideas that come off of one foundation?
---
If you need a break take one. It's ok to not want to play. Watch a TV show get some fresh air. It's not a job it's a game!
---
There are these things called “side missions”. Also dailies and events. You really should look into those!
---
I had a good laugh thks.🤣🤣
---
I would say what he’s doing is the exact opposite of “grinding”. He’s going full steam toward the endgame.
---
Its ok after the second launch the pip boy will turn into a liberator and piss lasers at the operator until they have to log out and join another server.(Unintentional of course.)
---
/r/fo76FilthyCasuals is unfortunately the best place to talk about the game and have some fun.
---
Never give to beggars, i dont. I see people playing, I talk or emote for a few, then if I have extra, i give some. Saw a lvl 30 the other day and was feeling generous right after finishing putting my power chassis together with names and complete sets. Had an extra t60 so I gave it to him. He was happy as a pig in Shit, but wasnt asking and certainly wasnt expecting it.
---
No, it was really good. That fact that you did it from memory makes it all the more impressive.
---
I agree. He is rushing.
---
JFC on your Stable flux
---
I've had that quest softlock several times, where npcs refused to progress so I had to change servers!
---
And the giraffe is a stuffed one.
---
Ok I’ll give that a shot, thanks
---
I got that shit while I was adventuring, and the sheepsquash spawned. It wasn't much, it's just the principle that irritates me lol
---
Tbh of I were you ied convert it and keep ultra lightweight guns
---
You won't be able to melee a SBQ or a colossal windy
---
I've been part of the FC community here and on discord for some time. They've been super helpful. However it's quiet restricted in open criticism and discussion of the game..I don't mind having a debate and argument but sometimes the vitriolic nature of this sub and others can be too much. It's either out of control or too controlled lol.
---
Kind of sounds like the doll house I built fo76
---
Thanks!  I finally finished up getting the skeleton today as well as my ghilley suit!  I'll be ready for more Bush Wookie hide and go seek for the rest of the NW challenges!
---
Dupers, new players, or people trying to cheese the level up challenge for score
---
It’s not as viable a solution if a weekly goal is do three nw challenges.
---
Bethesda forcing me to play NW does not make me like it more. By contrast, score goals that required events and teams and workshops proved enjoyable and have enhanced my game experience.
---
Except most of the stuff on here is just flame posting about a bug or something. It's not even usually useful or productive. If you say "my stuff dissapeared" followed by "is anyone even working???" versus "I was sprinting, dropped an item and quickly closed my pipboy" or something close to reproduction steps then it isn't valid criticism. In other words, complaints followed by insults are not criticism, it's just bitching and moaning.
---
Yes! This is THE waterfall. Tricky to build (and maintain) there for novices but worth it if you know what you’re doing.
---
The fixer usually would be closer to 2k in caps if you had max charisma and the vendor perk card level 3, otherwise closer to 3k. Knowledge from a friend
---
Happens to me all the time, you get used to it
---
Is there anything they *didn't* mess up with this patch?
---
Yea, thats the always nice. Wish they would buff the t60 tho.
---
I have no idea what the SBQ is, nor a colossal windy, but I did spend like 30/40 minutes slowly beating a scorchbeast to death each time it landed at level 20. I don't want to do that again.
---
I installed on my non-OS drive and upon launch I got that error.  I left the game and completed my Bethesda account creation.  I then restarted the game and the error was resolved!
---
However, I then got the NoRegionPing error which is resolved by installing the game on the OS drive.
---
I uninstalled and won't look back.
---
I love this idea, but I think the game would have a hard time tracking who blew up what.
---
ok thanks!
---
This happened to me the other day and then it basically killed me. It made me beg for help but obviously no one was going to help me so I had to let myself die to respawn. I thought they did it on purpose so they could take my loot. That there was a guy on his house a guy on his shop and the guy standing out by the road. so I crept back up all stalker like and stared at them through the woods to see if they were waiting for me. I decided to run past them go in and find my loot which they never took. Realized it was just an accident. 🤣🤣🤣 fo76 paranoia...the movie.
---
Ah sadly I am on PC :-(
---
I think I can. Might depend on the location you want. I like to kinda work with your character's backstory too, so location can be a good storytelling device. I tend to build without too many glitches.
---
I agree with you that NW is not very accessible to people with disabilities. NW (and some aspects of the base game, for example, the scorched officers) are not friendly for Deaf people, for example. There are a lot of audio cues that I can hear, as a Hearing person, but I feel for Deaf people, who are at a disadvantage. Bit of a tangent, but I agree with you there.
---
I’ll second what the other commentator said about grinding XP, but if you do want to keep up with NW, here’s some tips from someone who sucks at PVP:
---
Find a good spawn location for yourself where you know you can find good gear. Narrow it down so that you spawn to it and can immediately run and grab the gear while you’re still in stealth. Better still, find a good place to hide that you can jump to right after. And then spend as much as you can in the game continuing to hide from bush to bush. Yeah, these challenges may take a few matches but those tips might help you survive long enough to get them. 
---
Also,  always pull up the map while loading into the match. It will show you where enemies are, so you can know how much you need to be on guard.
---
Doesnt hurt or help me. I run in ultracite armor I was gifted. The only thing i dont like about it is the lack of skins for it. I now have all the plans and am collecting for a new set to pass on to the next person. Again.
---
Middle of the nuke zone. Helps people trying to complete the trophy that requires you to be there when the bomb drops.
---
I got 3 harpoon guns and 3 broadsiders in a row for my sneaky sniper.
---
bon dia
---
Off topic but I just did beckets dailey and got a junkies the fixer
---
Make your own! People will join.
---
So its exactly like a job that has been outsourced to india.
---
All information goes through the translator, and what you get is what you get.
---
So they made this invention in China called gunpowder.
---
It goes boom.
---
It's not a water fall though
---
Worser isn't a standardised word
---
That must feel good. You should go test that out and see how it holds up.
---
That’s hilarious. Settlers suck!
---
Hey, you used it correctly this time!  Well done!
---
Yeah I honestly can finally dump plans that don’t sell to people who definitely need it.
---
If they can mark your junk paper bag for you to find, or mark a quest corpse, then they can certainly mark the location of that dead legendary.
---
What!!?
---
As someone who puts his vendor besides the front door to try and be convenient I’d like to apologize that the fast traveling seems arbitrarily random on where you get dropped. My current camp location has the fast travel point a sprint down the road outside my camp, while old location caused people to down behind my building a level or two up in the air (and sometimes inside the foundations).
---
I wish we had fast travel mats like fallout 4 did.
---
It’s part of the game. No one stole anything from you, and you’ve even admitted it was much at all. 
---
You probably could have already replaced your lost junk as well.
---
Iv been running a junkies explosive combat rifle and have been waiting to get a fixer and I'm just in shock now I didnt think the ally daileys gave out stuff like that, I even got a furious faster fire rate handmade yesturday it's been so long since iv gotten anything for my characters that I didnt purchase from someone's vender
---
Sounds like a Gannt chart nightmare. People already complain about scrapbox limits, add a feature like auto-add loot and heads will explode along with server activity for this sub.
---
I feel you. Junkies ffr +agi handmade...for my heavy weapons character.
---
Oh, ok. Thanks!
---
I've known my family since birth, so I should be able to complain about them all I want.
---
What platform are you on??? I just had that happen on the server I was on. If that was you, I appreciate the 6 free legendaries lol
---
Negative
---
 No, I know.. I watch this podcast called Your Moms House and they always say ‘way worser’ and so when I hear someone say something is “way worse” I always think of it
---
i lose on average one of those per play.  so about 4 hours or so
---
They do a bit don't they?
---
XB1 xD
---
I always wondered the same thing but I believe it’s just because it’s a lot more popular then Flatwoods
---
&gt; I wish we had fast travel mats like fallout 4 did.
---
So do I but I guess idiots with trap camps probably ruined any chance of that happening.
---
What do you mean exactly? The dailies are given to you when you talk to or go near the quest giver so as long as you wait until your daily reset you should always be able to get them.
---
you can only do them once a day
---
Nah, Rocksy doesn’t care what happened just so long as the job is done. You never have to kill a Raider traitor. The worst you have to do is lie, and it’s a lie to benefit everyone.
---
Damn, guess it wasn't you lol
---
Ahhhh, you're one of those
---
It has flaws is one way to say it but one other way is screaming from the mountain tops that this game is damn near not even function half the time anymore and the lack of proper care the throwing out of plans from the developer and the hideous crafting/stash prompts is another way. This game deserves criticism and I for one hope it continues on a regular basis under the school of thought that the squeky wheel get the grease is still as valid as ever.
---
Ahh ok makes sense
---
Go into settings and turn on pacifist mode just in case you accidentally hit the wrong person
---
The only way you can use Plant foods is by using the carnivore serum to counter the negative effects of it for 1 hour. Otherwise having Carnivore mutation does not allow the use of Plants. Alternatively you can remove Starched Genes and take a chance of eating a Radaway with the hope it only removes the 1 mutation you want removed.
---
When do they reset???
---
Would you suggest I go the path of energy weapons or standard guns? I have seen the ability to farm fusion cores at some power plants, which makes PA/Gatling lasers very viable looking... but at the same time I don't really find enough plasma/gatlings to scrap down for mods.
---
When NW started it was just Flatwoods, so maybe it's that it's the "nee place to die". 🤓
---
I got a mounted glowing one plan you can have, if you're still looking
---
How old is the machine and when did you last make sure the cooling system was cleaned out?
---
What. Why? I have 40+ at 100c on my camp.
---
I’m not sure what you mean but I still feel ashamed
---
New* 😳
---
right? people act like level 100 is the only one with rewards...
---
Don't complain there are no bugs and this guy doesn't like it.
---
Oh dam, I forgot about the ammo converter ... I'm dumb. Had a fun time using that fatman you can find in West tek, though lol.
---
I also was duped by it a little bit.  I wasn’t aware that it doesn’t include the diner seating (which is from the red rocket Pack) as well as the wall lights they display in the picture.
---
Also... I bought the vendor and then later decided to buy the pack so... yeah.
---
I believe it is 8pm eastern.
---
From the countless threads I've perused it seems it's always been broken, from the beginning. I have an inkling that whatever projectile exploding malady ails the Broadsider, is the same as that which ails the Cryolator.
---
But is not tedium for me. Really, it's fun. It's sad for me how some people wanna overthink how it would be instead of enjoy what it is. Simulate problem solving and adaptation are part of the fun.
---
👍
---
LOL HAHA!
---
Not sure if this is where I should comment or not, but I get two errors. First I'll get the NoRegionPing, and if I restart my PC the game will just fail to launch altogether and forces me to reinstall. (Says that the game is offline, and that the hadrive it was installed to may be missing.)
---
I've already tried everything except switching the files over to my C: drive. I just have 150g on it since it's an SSD.
---
You can earn exactly 2000 per day if you do all the challenges, so it’s likely that that’s going to be the cap. Would fit Bethesda’s “~2 hours per level at later levels” estimate
---
Well obviously, but I was wondering if there was some tactical difference or... something that made it more popular
---
And for the love of crackers, don’t put those vault boy signs that point and they are just not pointing you in the direction of anything.
---
Maybe some rules for uploading Images would help, no NSFW and so on
---
Well, I suppose that makes sense. Thanks
---
if you're in the EU, I believe you'll be placed on an EU server unless you join someone on a US one
---
I usually have good luck about weapons. I changed my build to use a 50 hunting rifle and found a 50 automatic, went and spent some scrip at the pick and got a really nice troubleshooters
---
Yeah, it was really cool seeing so many single digit characters running around.  Some of them stopped by my CAMP to check out the vendors, grab some water from the water purifier, ride the golden Mr. Fuzzy, and stuff like that.  I decided to make a resistant marine wetsuit and marine tactical helmet and drop it in a bag with some stimpaks, for the first newbie I saw after I made them.  I dropped the bag, tried using the "follow me" emote, tried crouching down a few times in front of the bag, then hopping up and down over the bag, then plugged in my mic and tried explaining over the area chat that I had gifts for them in the bag.  They stood there staring for a while, then ran away.  I gathered the stuff up and tried with the next newbie I found.  It was the same story.  FINALLY, the third newbie I tried gifting those things to checked the bag, took the gifts, then gave me a heart emote.  I gave them a thumbs up back, then I walked away.  
---
I love it when I get to help out new players with some little gifts that can help them out, but it is exhausting, because I usually spend a LOT of time trying to just give someone some gifts, and it usually takes a very long time to find someone who understands to look in the bag.  That is why I don't even try as often as I used to, but with SO MANY single digit players on the server today, I just really wanted to give someone something.  :)
---
I saw some of the other comments, where people think their outfits may have intimidated the new players, but I have a female character wearing the nuka-girl outfit, the only thing covering her face is the veil from the Mistress of Mystery quests, and her headgear is a halo.  Seriously, I have a freaking HALO!!!  How can you not trust me???  LOL  :D
---
Some high levels give, some high levels take.
---
No, I said refute, that's intentional. You're asking a question here (which could be solved with a simple wiki search by the way), and when someone have you an answer you responded with "depends", as a form of contradiction. So it seems you already have an answer in your mind, so why bother asking this? If you responded with "Doesn't metal have higher DR? Why do you say secret service?" that'd be more fair.
---
MODUS' grin is now a frown
---
I wish I had done one quest line at a time. I did all quests at once just completely them geographically to be more efficient. The result was I didn't get involved emotionally in any quest or even know what I was doing a lot of the time. Just heading to a waypoint on the map to get some XP. I have no idea what the Order of Mysteries was, some cosplaying grandma? No idea what the Overseer was about or what she was trying to do, also a cosplaying grandma?
---
This has been going on since the game started, it’s not happening.
---
That happened to me as well but only once.
---
The crystallizing barrel has never worked in this game. I can say with confidence it’s been busted since day 1.
---
Coming to my C.A.M.P is an event in itself.
---
I wish robot legendaries had something to find them. Maybe robot flies, 😄
---
I'm in the US. Don't have a lot of people to play with and why not play with some someone from a different country? Lol
---
mine are around the back on the deck. you can reach it from my ponds deck
---
Strange... I always take their caps, kill them for calling me an asshole, then tell Rocksy the job is done, and get rep. She never sounds thrilled and she doesn’t ask for details.
---
I do that every time it pops up on the map.  When I saw the "kill three legendaries" pop up as a daily challenge today, I immediately thought "Yep!  I got that covered!"  LOL  :D
---
Should have emptied the resources yourself, let them pick the lock and get a bounty!
---
I am at level 175 and I have never done this event.
---
Should be worth more notes in my opinion. It’s more of a medium event. Still, make it public and trigger-able with harder enemies, and it’d be fun.
---
I’m hopeful there will be more of them in the future.
---
Same here. It’s never worked properly. And I fucking loved it in 4 so I still keep one or two on me (yay bear arms) to keep an eye on it after each update. Never seen that barrel work properly.
---
Think it means if you buy it on steam then try to buy it on bethesda launcher youre only gonna get the atoms in the bethesda launcher .
---
It has some damage resistance. Unless it was a bug when I wore it all the time, it did work a few months back. I used to get ballistic fiber on it down to 7 I think.
---
Could have sworn I've used it to slow down the SBQ before, because the normal barrel has the range of a flamer!
---
Think that means if you buy the bundle more than once, you'll only get the Atoms and kits because you already have the outfit.
---
you get the outfit, I am on pc and got it
---
I think it just means that if you buy the bundle multiple times, you'll get the outfit only on the first time. The rest will just give you atoms and kits.
---
These are all seriously my favorite guns in past fallouts. And the target computer missile launcher.
---
I feel so personally attacked by this game sometimes.
---
No. The Bloodied and Junkies might be worth vending as long as you don't imagine you're going to get 4000 caps for them, maybe 1000 is more realistic
---
I'd love to see if you bring this idea to fruition!
---
I can't recall where exactly this was, but I found [this oil seep surrounded by trees](https://66.media.tumblr.com/43c2f099fee1caa343cc0950f630b473/2c9ab3990f3ebe4a-c6/s2048x3072/51ce075fcd3c5ec52ba65cb7d55b041fe12500dd.png) in the northern part of the Divide and it straight up gave me of Glastonbury Grove vibes 👀❤
---
Level 20. It was also considered silenced so you could use it as a stealth gunslinger. Plus the Hub’s Alien Blaster was good for a crit build
---
I have one too. It works. Sometimes. But it’s definitely buggy as all hell. It reliably 1 shots mole miners though, so there’s that!
---
Oh. Okay. I just didn't want to buy it and not get the outfit. Thank you!
---
My main is at 195 rn and iv been running the combat since level 50, and my 2nd is level 176, and today's been the only day I can say that iv actually found stuff for my character not at a shop, I also found a bloodied handmade +10 damage at a shop this week
---
I don't see how it could get much worse.
---
*turns brightness up*
---
necro...mancer
---
if you know you know
---
Oh. That makes sense. Thank you!
---
You need to level wayyyy more than that for belly of the beast.
---
The first time we beat bosses like a scorchbeast or sheepsquatch, it is pretty exciting.  Congratulations!  :)
---
Oh. Thanks for the help!
---
I'm with yah. I might hit 20 if I'm lucky this week.
---
Don’t take this the wrong way: But Cryolators don’t really belong in this game lore-wise. 
---
At least not as their model is. Should be more ramshackle, like a Fireman Protectron arm or something. Still shit that we still have broken weapons.
---
I'm just wondering why they're called that his early in the timeline... To my knowledge they were only called that in Fallout 3 due to the ghoulified Chinese soldiers around in the area.
---
I do the same. And plans are a waste for me. I wanrt the Ultracite calibrated shocks plans and that's about it. I used to give ammo away, now I recycle it.
---
She's sending you out to kill them though, when you don't she acts surprised.
---
We're comparing it to the dozens of other games that have been doing a better job with the daily grind for decades. If it was 2002 this would be more acceptable
---
I like action boy during the occasional sponge fight, like the queen.  It juices you up during your reloads, allowing you to keep chaining in vats. (Event team)
---
I like marathoner for finding fights. You can sprint across an entire region while using vats like sonar! Sprint click click sprint click (hunting team)
---
I like grim reaper sprint for rapid steam-rolling through the mobs at events. Headshot headshotheadshotheadshot (building team)
---
As you'd prefer.  I hope my perspective helps
---
The RNG is wonky. If your first item is crap, stop buying items from that server.
---
If your first item is good, unload your scrip on that server!
---
I got 2 three-star Fixers at the same time doing this.
---
Oh. Okay. Thank you for your help!
---
No fascists allowed in my wasteland! What makes the brotherhood any better than those who dropped the first bombs? Hoarding technology because they have trust issues? Well I don’t trust them!
---
The moment vault dwellers pick a side is the moment they’re no longer a free person. Government failed to protect us, vault-tec wanted nothing more than test subjects; hell! Even the overseer abandoned us when the vault opened! They’re not here to help anyone, they never are. Only can trust yourself, your gun, and the occasional fellow ex-dweller. 
---
No. This wasteland is MY wasteland. Anyone who wants to change that better be ready for the fight of their life.
---
(I say as I ally with the settlers and the raiders because Bethesda doesn’t give us a choice to remain independent lmao)
---
I think it’s a "rather die than..." analogy.
---
Lol hoarders are the best
---
Well the Xbox said it was made in 2015 and i never really thought about the cooling system so I'll have to check that out
---
I love this post.
---
Also I usually make one to three obvious, and hide one with the good stuff.
---
I just wish there was rep for the two factions with this. It would make the grind just that much easier. Ending one: You steal the supplies and give them to crater. Gain raider rep Ending two: you take the supplies to foundation and gain settler rep. Ending three: you steal some supplies and get a little of both rep. Again, this is my opinion and I’m not a dev
---
LORDT HAVE MERCY ON THIS SOUL, THEY KNOW NOT WHAT THEY SAY!
---
It’s a solid 15 min of gameplay. Now they’ve got the weird starting the event fixed, it’s very consistent and a guaranteed GOOOD time.
---
Thats a lot of levels to get what you need. Im glad you got it though. Im only lvl 78
---
Oh yeah it does that no problem. It’s just that the range is total ass (was bad in 4 but was a bit better I think). And more importantly the ballistic damage that the stat screen claims it adds is completely nonexistent. Like it doesn’t register at all. So it looks like you should be doing more damage per shot but all you inflict is the energy portion and nothing more.
---
In fallout 4 it was devastating. Like seriously chunked enemy health bars with ease. That’s what I mean when I say it’s busted. That whole attribute is totally borked.
---
It sounds like it's overheating and shutting down.
---
I open up my console once a year to clean out the fan and duct.
---
Watch a video how to do it and you should be just fine.
---
The freeze continues to apply, that aspect does work, but the damage is essentially non-existent when hitting directly with the snowball.
---
I’d say a build is recommended, but not overly necessary. You can’t really do a full on jack of all trades like in a normal Fallout game imo. 
---
I’d recommend looking up various builds and see what suits your favorite play style. Fortunately you’re not overly limited to where you can definitely pair two different weapon types such as rifles and heavy weapons. I run a heavy gunner/rifleman build and it feels pretty varied. Plus I got enough points in strength if I want to shift to melee/rifleman.
---
You can play however you like. Yes following a build will allow you to get the most out of endgame content but its not necessary. I made my own build that suits what I want. Yea sure I can't 1 shot everything but I enjoy my build and it works for what I want.
---
You rushed through Responders, Raiders, Free States and BoS and you are lvl23? I have difficulty believing that but yeah slow down. How did you even get through the Mire is a mystery to me.
---
My favorite one is when some dick with an explosive weapon decides it would be funny to blast the corpse to the stratosphere
---
the most popular duped legacy is a bloodied explosive gatling plasma.
---
No
---
Fallout 4 was my first game in the franchise. It made me fall in love with it because I could take my time and uncover 1000 other stories that go along with the main storyline.
---
Fallout 76 is the same for me. I love just wandering around, taking my time, and slowly exploring locations. I’ll often look them afterwards on the wiki to make sure I didn’t miss anything any story that might be there.
---
Well to be fair it's never really meant to be a high damage weapon, it's a support tool.
---
Can you point me in the direction of where you found your build or what build you’re working with?
---
I like where your head is. I wouldn’t change this event, personally. But more smash n grab reputation events would be a dope addition. 
---
But there I go again. Dreamin of what FO76 could be...
---
Quit.  
---
They are \*not\* here to build the ideal game for us. Bethesda answers to investors just like every other dev. They're here to build a game thats  
---
1)  Profitable for their investors.
---
2)  Reasonably engaging but not too rewarding, otherwise you won't grind for things, which means you aren't spending additional time, which means you aren't spending MONEY.
---
Yea but having the stealth armor at level 30 was REALLY nice. Grinding in stealth mode let me kills things I normally could not kill.
---
YUP!  One of my favorite quick and easy events.  As soon as I saw the daily challenge to kill three legendaries, I thought "Yup, I can spare ten minutes and do it with a melee weapon!"  :)
---
Because of my lack of time to play (lots of work) so far I've gotten both legs, right arm and underarmor and shielding lining for Secret Service. While i do wish it where just a bit faster of a grind im not too fussed with getting everything just yet as I won't use most other stuff.
---
Shit. I just experienced it last night for the first time after a casual stroll through white spring for the zillionth time
---
Ah another post about this months later. Im not saying this to sound like an ass. Just the fact that this is a great idea yet Bethesda is being lazy.
---
&gt; want the game to actually be fun instead of shitty RNG grind boom, ENTITLED ASSHOLE
---
The grind is a sensible subject tbh, things should always be grindy in nature to an extent otherwise the game is done in a day. But there needs to be a fine line between acceptable grind and soul crushing grind.
---
FO76 in some places go too far into the soul crushing, but im also 510% against removing grinds entirely.
---
PS: *The "i have a life" argument that i often see thrown around by those who want to abolish grinds, holds no weight whatsoever btw. You chose to set your priority to your IRL. Doing so forfeits your right to always be on par with those who can play non stop.
---
You will forever be a step behind those who can live and sleep in the game, accept it. You do not deserve handouts or shortcuts to anything more than anybody else.*
---
There's so many items in this game that shouldn't belong in the game lore-wise, the gamma gun, the Nuka-World X0-1 Quantum paint, the tesla gun, the harpoon gun, trapper raider armor. Bethesda wanted to reuse assets from Fallout 4 to flesh out the world plain and simple, but if they are going to bother ripping assets into 76 they should at least take the time to make them functional. Sheesshkapeesh, they didn't even have to dream them up themselves, that was the actual hard part.
---
There really isn't any reason to go onto a random bus full of bombs unless you are a fellow trash hoarder
---
Basically all it’s good for is it’s freezing efficiency compared to the normal barrel. So if you just wanna freeze the queen keep using it. But it’s sadly a shell of its former self in terms of general combat :(
---
Yes, well done!  Isn’t it great learning something new?  That’s twice in a row you’ve correctly used an ellipse. 
---
I am very proud of you.
---
And that's the thing. I haven't been tallying where my score is at per se, but after each day, I have been claiming the Legendary Run prizes. I'm still low enough that the thousand that would have come from that weekly would have pushed me up and over the threshold for the next prize, but I didn't get that. I also completed two dailies and it didn't refresh with the spare thousand in case a single one would have triggered it, so all I can do is shrug and pretend Bethesda is the loveable goofball of my gaming collection.
---
I also did this today. My first server had 8 people doing project paradise, so I joined in. Second server had 2 single person teams, and no one at the active event. Left immediately, and the third server had project paradise again with about 10 people.
---
i’m level 100 something now, and i love helping newer players, it just feels nice. One thing i don’t like is the fact that most newer players see us and do either 1 out of 3 things. 1. Run away 2. Freeze up until we leave or 3. attack us. I feel like these reactions are caused by toxic high levels who kill anyone on sight with op weapons which isn’t cool
---
Nah it’s totally fun dreaming about what 76 could be, I do it all the time. I also like your idea of reputation events, maybe 1-2 for foundation 1-2 for crater?
---
[This](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/builds/)  site has a bunch of builds you can look through. I started out as stealth gunslinger which got me through the main story pretty easily. Now I run a heavy gunner/rifleman build which is pretty fun for me.
---
You don’t necessarily need to have a specific build but picking certain perks like bloodymess or adrenaline that cover wider areas will help you in a few late game fights. The only true thing to decide is what type of weapon and if power armor or standard armor you want use so in that case I guess you need somewhat of a build) 
---
IE if you prefer rifles or would rather use automatic rifles you need to decide between commando / rifleman solely to maximize your damage. Or picking power armor perks or barbarian to maximize efficiency and damage resistance.
---
In regards to bloodied or junkies etc. you can play the game fine without worrying about a legendary build and focus solely on your character’s stats. 
---
TLDR; 
---
Legendary builds aren’t important, but perks and stats should be customized to you personal liking and to what makes the game easier.
---
Mine's around the back of my house, out of the way.
---
Is 100 caps too much for common garbage legendaries? Stuff you'd only sell for scrip? I'm playing on a low level and the legendaries I'm getting are pure garbo and I have no real interest in getting legendaries for this character so I'm trying to sell them but no one's bought any.
---
I was wondering what happened to the mat.  It is still in misc and can be used at claimed workshops tho
---
I make a lap around all the forward stations in the bog + fort defiance. Usually it's between 40 and 50.
---
But I use it to craft thorn armor,I almost always repair everything with free repair kits I get from queen fights
---
Yeah, kill the legendary and hope everyone else sorts out the random mkbs. Loot &gt; random event participants.
---
You say not many people have “headphones”. Every PS4 comes with a device to talk. 
---
That’s my point.
---
well if people quit buying the cosmetic power armor  stuff in the atom shop they just might give people a reason to wear power armor.
---
Yeah I see where you’re coming from. There’s just so much cool shit at foundation and vault 79 and crater and all of it. Plus, it’s not really the huge grind, it’s the one on top of the other on top of the other That is tiring to me. Seasons+rep+79=months of work. But hey, you’re entitled to you’re opinion.
---
Ah, but the damage remains unaffected if you don't add the barrel and you retain the same freeze effect. Without the barrel the damage is similar to the flamer (pre-buff).
---
Until 2076
---
Yep. Same thing happened in wow.  Once you put structure into the game play you create burnout
---
weapons and armor you find are in excellent condition and you can sprint for a LOOOOOONG time. Especially with the new team mechanics, Unyielding is so OP the bloodied weapon is hardly necessary. heres my typical special: https://imgur.com/a/uxUVzb3
---
I walked into an inviting house that had vendors in a room at the bottom of some stairs. When I went in, it filled with spike traps. Didn't die, just stepped back a bit and looked at one shop before sighing at the garbage and leaving.
---
If you are going to try to murder me in your shop trap, at least sell something interesting for if I survive.
---
Yea to make it worse I ran faschnant every hour I was awake and did my class work inbetween to not get all 4 mask, and also I open pry over 300 mole miner pales to not get the croc backpack... my friend opened under 50....
---
Let me know if you want a hand.
---
At least the repeatables mean I may be able to get to Rank 100 by the end of Week 7 if I keep up my activities. Assuming they don't remove it!
---
That was probably me. I've struggled over my spawn point, thinking I have it right where I want it, then 1 time out of 10 randomly spawning off the side of the cliff, plummeting to my near-death at the bottom. I'll admit, not the best way to welcome your customers. Enjoy a stimpak on the house next time!
---
U can't display power armor it'll go back to your inventory after like 60secs. Plus noone can steal it.
---
Did you know that you could save yourself some time by using [ampersands](https://youtu.be/Tjp-ZTK36Vg)?
---
You can use it on a claimed workshop.  It's in misc
---
It's not.  But it shouldn't feel like a job to unlock content.
---
I have my shop in a separate building
---
Thats just shit luck. If it makes you feel better, i only recently discovered backpacks, and dont have one. I think the dont work in PA, so not like it will help now.
---
Literally a portion of the guns in this game are actually broken, as in also do not register damage or break and stop registering damage completely. The tesla rifle, the scattered laser gun, the auto grenade launcher, the plasma thrower barrel, various grenades and more all either do damage then break and stop doing damage at all (or stop doing damage then disable ALL your range damage) or randomly do not do any damage at all. They really need to fix some of these bugs, every patch more weapons literally become unusable.
---
Alright thanks
---
The one challenge about capturing workshops caused some actual PVP to happen in Adventure. The challenge to build stuff in a workshop caused some to just be filled with LOTs of toilets. It is interesting to see how the SCORE challenges change behavior.
---
They go to a station, sell a legendary etc. Jump server, leave and go back to the original server, go back to the station and buy the gun back that didn't actually leave their inventory. (Missed a few key points of how it works.)
---
Edit - ruined the grind for me. I enjoy trading and building up to the gun and armour I wanted. I felt good knowing I worked for it but now all you see on the market are 2525 guns and red asylum. 
---
The game is fucked because this file is so easy.
---
😩 I wish that I could draw. Well done. Thanks for sharing it. You should make a Floater.
---
Worked for me. thanks OP
---
Allies with Ghouls &gt; Allies with Foundation.
---
yeah, and you’ve used the gauss minigun before you’ve said this right? Like really used it, at a queen, or line in the sand, or project paradise? Good and actually used it, and think it’s fine?
---
Sounds like a match made in heaven, haha.
---
This one is a valid complaint as its a bug. 
---
Complaining about stuff like NW challenges though however is not. 
---
(I know you didn't im just saying)
---
The answer to most of your questions is, "to facilitate micro-transactions," or, "to force engagement."
---
They can take your Power armor if you drop it but not if you place it
---
Camp build, looking for pets, exploring, etc.    Never made any attempt to level grind because there's no point.    
---
Even assuming I was level 400 at that rate it would still be absurd.
---
When they released that contemporary house with white porches I had trouble when I would drink and vendor hop. I couldn't tell one camp from the next.
---
Figured. I will still sell them at 100 though.
---
You need more than that.
---
All of the vendors are like this. You paid for a skin to apply to a vending machine, but it functions the same. :)
---
Best spot in the game, imo. The waterfall and broken boat cave add character and the pond has a useful surprise in it.  The cliff and fog make for great photos of the build as well.
---
I personally prefer Flatwoods as there's more places to hide, the games are longer and I prefer wilderness over urban areas...But Morgantown is a lot of open area where people are sniper-happy and you can't hide well.
---
Stimpacks are easy. You can span 6 on 1 bullet hit. You just have to find then. But I definitely agree, these challenges are getting tougher- actually had to try to damage 10 things to fix seeing how I normally use perks to repair to 200%
---
No, they don't. I do a ton of Monster Mash, I'd notice with how dim it is in there.
---
Flatwoods is pretty flat, also no one likes climbing up the Gorge Hill, it's just a handles especially on the Flatwoods side. The Helvitia side is easier to climb.
---
Use the camera, it shows the names and can highlight enemy bodies. That trick saved me loads of time searching.
---
Try leaving the server and or closing your game and trying again.
---
Are... Are you saying death threats is a justified reaction over a fucking bag? 
---
Please don't say that's what you're saying...
---
That exploit is fixed now but to have it happen you had to have bugged out your camp budget so it was higher than it was supposed to be and if it was to close to the spawn point, they accessed the vendor before the camp could fully load they could take everything for free.  Did not happen to me but was a big thing about a month ago (or whenever they turned the vendors back on after they were disabled for a while, time is running together)
---
I never got any of the skins.. this is the first vendor I bought that looks nothing like the original locker ones
---
They want us to invest time into Nuclear Winter which I'm all for. I'm level 78 and I'm slowly creeping up to level 100 just for the Power Armor. 
---
Hopefully in Season 2 we get a new NW rewards run from level 1B-100B (1A-100A being the 1st season).
---
I have low charisma so all I can share are rank one perks. Normally travel agent. Is that a good one?
---
You have to wait for Ward to go back to bed....
---
Huh. I'll have to check it out. I've yet to try it.
---
You need a LOT more than that.
---
Because Foundation’s achievement only recently became available, where the other has been available since beta in October 2018? I’m not sure why this is so surprising. 😂 Many of the people who completed the nuke one have not come back to the game for Wastelanders yet (or may not at all) because they finished the main game, or lost interest, etc. So I feel this is fair difference.
---
ETA: Disregard, I derped.
---
I lost a match because of bloatflies. They agro me and I was up against a PA user, could have taken him out but the flies got in the way of my VATS grenade shot and I lost.
---
I'm a supporter of criticism when it's needed. And, by God, does this game need it.
---
But, it is really nice to see positive posts like this one sprinkled in amongst the 50 posts talking about the exact same shit.
---
This fixed it for me as well. Thank you so much!
---
I don't really think it would be a problem for people to have the option to receive or get these things faster, anyways. It's healthier for the player, frankly.
---
nowhere did i say "abolish grinds" 
---
this is the shit that always happens, someone points out how absurd a grind is, then someone else comes and accuses them of wanting all grinds gone despite that not being the case.
---
its always the same deliberate misrepresentation and strawman BS every time.
---
What was Belly of The Beast? Glassed Cavern or whatever it's called? Holy shit I took that at like L50 and lost a lot of ammo....
---
Sorry, I meant for the Fixer
---
I was on earlier, 1800 ET. Lots of folks coming through Vault 76. I also had many stopping at my camp. I am just north of the vault.
---
That was my very 1st CAMP location, it has a nice scenery but it got overrule by other people, so I found another quiet spot. Savage Divide has the best spots for camps.
---
Conversely, I'm level 77 in NW and I'm tired of PVP; so I don't mind these sillier NW challenges because I'm playing more casually.
---
That challenge was a pretty decent simulator of real-life hunting in Appalachia though, wherein you also have to check over your shoulder to avoid being shot by meth addicted hillbillies.
---
Yeah but a lucky mod listing can save using flux and all that shit. I'd still check it if you wanna use X01 as the better stuff DOES turn up.
---
I would like a helping hand. I'm trying to help new players start off right
---
The best player vendor I've found is the person, that TODAY, had the unyielding heavy metal left leg that I've been looking for for the last month and a half.
---
Yeah. Raiders justify their ideologies with half-straw statements like, 'well rough world lol' I don't think that justifies killing everyone, holding them up and taking everything they own. Beheading them and putting said head on a pike. Being generally edgy for no reason other then, 'just because' -- There's nothing really deep about that.
---
Yeah man I once went on a 5 hour long shooting spree over a bag once too. The bag massacre they called it, now that's why bags are outlawed.
---
&gt; the other has been available since beta in October 2018?
---
Wow, I had no idea FO76 was on Steam back in 2018. Incredible!
---
Preventative maintenence is a necessity. Air blowers on the exterior only do so much.
---
Capital G Gamers RISE UP! /s
---
How about a place where you can scroll through ALL system messages?
---
It happened to me for the first time today (PC), but I was playing at the rollover (I was too into it to remember to log out!). I submitted a ticket but I don't reckon I'll get a response. It is really demoralizing.
---
Ok, gt is narmy knight. I can pull some waters and prep for the 25th. Cant move my camp but can post with you to hand out and repair as needed.
---
I don't know how many stale EA jokes get barfed up here too, it's almost like a circle jerk on here at times.
---
You’re absolutely right, my apologies. Wasn’t thinking Steam. That’s my mistake entirely.
---
Since the legendary run I’ve played almost every day and leveled up every time. With the right XP boosts you could do that every day and be around 4 years...or 2 levels a day and just over 2. But yes this is the real world and nobody has that much time every day so yea it’s a little much.
---
Dude I totally understand. I intentionally put my vendors up front right next to the only doorway. Almost everything costs 69. And I intentionally made the cigarette dispenser cost 6666 per plan, because fuck cancer.
---
Yeah I do about 3 rolls and if the trend is utter shit I stop trying.
---
I hate that slurry gypsy bitch.
---
By harder, most certainly not more crates to find. On a serious note, am I correct in understanding the health of the Brahman is the determination for the quality of the  rewards?
---
It was set up that way in the early days of this sub so that people couldn't farm karma. 
---
Kind of ironic given what a currency farming shit show the game has turned out to be.
---
Thanks
---
i got super lucky. I stumbled across a guy who must have been afk in a bush. I killed him and he had 6 stimpacks on him. We were at the edge of the circle. I jumped in and out of the storm using the stimpacks. The 9 creatures one I didnt even try since the 3 one took me ages to get. I am sure they reduced the creature spawns.
---
You know the other day i learnt you can actually get the thing on top of westtek.
---
*Stares in online MP fallout*
---
Good idea! Fallout 4 had an excellent mod that had corpses glow for an adjustable period of time and intensity, with toggles for legendary-only IIRC.
---
Better: Make it something to be earned, and then upgraded, in-game, like the initial backpack, but with a better story line.
---
I had to gather corn, tatos and mutfruit for more adhesive to finish it
---
It's not hard to do a level day even at level 200.
---
so, you consider stealing to be a crime worthy of death. 
---
But the raiders killing the people who are stealing their land and stuff are evil.
---
interesting perspective.
---
Seriously the price of Ultracite .45 is booming on the trade thread. Those B2525 fixers are everywhere.
---
&gt; Why can't you create a pill to find corpses?  
---
This would be better than nothing, but frankly, I'm not looking for something else to farm ingredients for.
---
I just finished my full set of buttressed SS w/ jetpack I I think it was somewhere around 8k bullion and 2.5k scrip before I got all pieces atleast 2* with the prefix I wanted. It's a grind FS but worth it
---
there are positive posts made EVERYDAY here. but OP acts like there arent and its BS
---
Nope. They do not play. They have a QA department, but no one at Bethesda really plays the game. They don't have time as they have jobs.
---
Didn't the recon scope use to ping enemies even after they died? I noticed after logging on for a while that its no longer the case
---
Reduced AP cost is a legendary effect, not a mod you can add to your weapon.
---
i could fill 8 vending machines with all the legendary pipe pistols i’ve gotten from her
---
You gotta smooth talk her first. Have you tried telling her how well decorated her place is? You gotta start with small talk and complements first - then get down to business.
---
I got my first one only from the machine in the purveyor yesterday. I have nearly 600 levels between 3 characters. My joy was real.
---
This is definitely a monkey's paw type of wish. 
---
"Bethesda, please make Legendary mob corpses more visible."
---
"Done. Corpses are now much more visible... because they will now float 20-30m in the air over the area you killed them. You might be able to reach them with the Marsupial mutation or a jet pack mod. Good luck."
---
If you're ever in Winnipeg Canada, hit me up and I'll buy you a beer/coffee! You are a fucking saint!
---
Conversely, if I'm looking for a quiet server so I can farm West tek, grab a few workshops or just putter about in peace and quiet, I'll stay in the ghetto! Overall, the changes make it easier to find a server that suits your play style for a session.
---
Someone needa buy my 12,000 cap Nuka Cola...
---
She tells you how people take everything they want, dont contribute, and then leave them to rot. Its not fair, so she sent a hunter to follow his trail, and gives you the location. She says if you find a corpse then someone got there first... she just wants to know that it's done.
---
If Foundation said those same things, and labelled the them a thief or traitor, there would be no hate.
---
Because they don't understand that Building teams are better.
---
Well at lest you get 1 cap back for drinking it so it’s technically 11,999
---
Yep, Project Paradise is definitely one of the winners of the new team groups!
---
750 each limb, and if I'm not mistaken 1200 for the torso more 150-200 for(each so arround 600 if you know what you need) arms/legs/torso mods and arround 750(not sure tho I think is 200 for the mod and 150 for the armour) for the full underwear shielded armour
---
yah but getting the pie from machine is like old school fanboy hype yk
---
That's my dream for my heavy build.... Always wanted such an alt weapon to my furious lazer gatler. Good for you!!!
---
Sometimes dead bodies relocate. Its a weird occurrence but I notice if there are a lot of dead bodies in close proximity  they will disappear and reappear somewhere else as either a meat pile, scrap pile or duffle bag depending on the type of enemy
---
run forest run
---
The Mire. Not Harper’s or the Valley or anything like that. Just the entire map be in the swamp.
---
its a wild experience
---
I agree with that point. Especially since the two issues he does point out have more or less been consistent since launch (almost two years ago).
---
But, I still support OPs larger point. There are way too many copy and paste style posts on here. Especially for stupid bs like Nuclear Winter challenges.
---
Posts on actual issues and bugs should be pushed. But there is too much random complaining that gets pushed too.
---
What a bright idea.
---
Good idea
---
Well from 99 to 100 is only 3500 so that wont happen till the very end and if you save all the atoms the board rewards you till the end you can buy the last 10 levs for free
---
Any automatic receiver, aligned barrel, aligned or forceful stock, quick or swift mag, reflex sight
---
Ive left so many camps because of that. My house is so simple. You walk in turn left and you see them. That simple.
---
That would be sweet
---
Because the "legendary" cards are such trash, the clearing out of crap cards is the only thing I'm looking forward to.
---
It's okay. Sorry I responded so sarcastically too, it's easy to get worked up over nothing. I wish it was on Steam in 2018, I could have been enjoying the game for much longer now.
---
Certain mods lower the cost too.
---
I did that a couple weeks ago that was suuuuuper fun! https://youtu.be/ENVVVzHPAUQ
---
I'm not sure. My builds usually don't use the recon scope. Heavy weapons or shotguns are my usual choice.
---
Stay in the Forest (green area around 76) until about level 30, and make sure to quickly get the Lead Belly and AquaBoy Perks. They will make your life so much easier
---
Thank you !!
---
Feeling real victimised by this
---
ty
---
Thank you! Just hit level 100 and it is my first explosive gun. I have used .50 cals and a Tesla rifle for lower level stuff for like the last 50 levels at least. So many rolls with the purveyor later and here I am! It definitely shreds! I'm so excited about it 😂
---
Sadly you can't ever go back into vault 79 even if you remember the password for the keypad
---
*ahem* one violent night
---
It’s like asking between Rust and...whatever maps MW has. Rust is just popular. Easy as that.
---
Those are the same rewards we have had for a year. 
---
I doubt they'll add new ones. Probably just new temp reward events like the one a month ago
---
Nah they dont help in pa and the mods for them are a hassle to get took me 3 days to get the plans for ballistic resistance
---
The response will be bog standard 'keep grinding pay real money' bs. I was asleep. I wasn't even on when it turned over so lord only knows whats up its buggy butt.
---
one time myself and another play downed a level 80 three star scorchbeast only for it to fall INTO the fissure ensuring we couldn't loot it. we looked at each other and did the thumbs down emote.
---
It's the principle, that's it
---
its the same story with alot of the "positive" posts too, atom shop this, community that. its always the same shit. bogs down actual discussion and brings nothing to the table.
---
unfortunately because of bethesdas refusal to actually interact with the community, the only way to get anything acknowledged by them is a large amount of similar topics at the same time.
---
Aah I remember! The ones that improves hip accuracy I believe. Sorry I've completely forgot, I even thought it was a fixed bug.
---
Aside from certain events that are meant for teams to complete (Scorched earth, encryptid, project paradise) I'd say no you dont really need a build for most of the games content but it will make it significantly easier/more fun I'd highly recommend trying to make a build it's a really fun to play around with and try different combos and a big part of the game. But with some decent gear you should be able to do fine
---
Yeah, its not just the grind. Its the damn cap on everything. Like I know, that it wont reset until about 5pm for me. It drives me mad, I have to wait until the afternoon until i cant get my limit of bullion, get my limit of scrip, get my 1400 caps. I hate the daily limits. It makes it feel like such a chore.
---
And like you said, the constant going to foundation and crater doing the same tedious simple quests. Spending so much time in fucking load screens. Its enough to make my brain melt.
---
Heh, you don’t know whether I’m coming or going.  Pay closer attention!
---
Like others said, take a break from the story line, doing side quests and dailies.  Also, explore as much of the forest as you can first (you get a little XP, every time you discover a new location).  Set up some of your own "daily runs" in the forest region, and maybe expand north and south, if you are comfortable.  The Morgantown Trainyard and Morgantown Airport (including the "Collision Course" event) were "staple" things that I did daily for all three of my characters, when I was working on leveling them up.  If you leave to another area, then come back a little later, the scorched there respawn pretty quickly, so you can do that run over and over (also a good way to build up steel scrap, meds, etc.).
---
The same with the Tyler County Fairgrounds and Tyler County Dirt Track.  Just go through and kill all of the scorched, then leave and come back a little while later to kill them again.  If you are on a public server, then do NOT claim the workshop on the dirt track, unless you want to engage in PvP (it is a good idea to be sure it is not already claimed, before you rush in there shooting).  A bonus about the fairgrounds is that there are a few spots where you might find a magazine or bobblehead.
---
When you feel ready, try killing Super Mutants in the Grafton Steel Mill.  If you only play on public servers, and you do not want PvP, then be sure the Grafton Steel Mill is not owned by a player, and be sure you do NOT claim the workshop there (to claim ANY workshop, you have to select the button where you agree to PvP).  However, just killing the Super Mutants will get you some good XP.  The Grafton Dam just south of the Grafton Steel Mill also has some Super Mutants, and there is sometimes an event called "Manhunt" that will pop up there, that you might want to try.
---
Have you done the "Mistress of Mystery" quests, yet?  If not, look for it in your Pip-Boy.  It is appropriate for you level, and when you are done you get a veil that protects you from airborne diseases, a cool sword, and a cool pistol (you will also be able to take stealth boys and craft them into a much better version of stealth).
---
Be sure to hit events in the forest region, whenever they pop up.  "Leader of the pack" is a quick and easy one that pops up pretty frequently, and you also end up with three low level legendaries you can scrip.
---
Aside from that, don't forget building in your CAMP, crafting (making weapons and armor, cooking, etc.), and things like that also give you some extra experience, so don't ignore doing those thing whenever you have time.
---
Of what?  Picking up discarded trash?
---
I’m part of a group that’s new player friendly. We do loads of stuff. Like role play, events grinding and more. We’re based of discord if your interested
---
Try switching to Beckett and do a couple of his missions before putting her back in. That's how I was able to get past this bug.
---
No. SCORE is tied to your profile like all challenges. If it was by character, then we could easily exploit to Atom Bundles in the Legendary Run.
---
ADDED NOTE: I mean, did you just think my very specific tip was pulled out of my ass and wasn't something I did myself just the other fucking day?
---
A good fix would be
---
A: make lootable bodies glow. Makes it easier for players to spot them 
---
B: consolidate all enemies poor menus into one if they are in close proximity. You get one menu pop up when aiming at a corpse but that menu shows all items from nearby corpses 
---
C: please for the love of God, prevent the game from making meat piles inaccessible. What I mean is sometimes you kill an enemy and it turns into a meat pile, then you kill another enemy and their corpse drops onto said meat pile but doesn't turn into a meat pile.
---
I may be confusing recon scopes from fo4 then.
---
So, tell me. Did you copy &amp; paste that, or are you typing it out each time?
---
I am aware of the 'don't play through turn over time' due to GTA online. This though is getting a lot ridiculous when you are actually asleep or in the case of another person who posted here managed to get the same 'achievements' complete in 6min (which is impossible). Right now on a weekend of week 1 of 6 lockdown (thanks Vic Aus morons) I am a lot more salty about this bug than I should be.
---
Would it work with the lore though? I thought the minute men developed it
---
Should I say anything?
---
I got it in Nuclear Winter.
---
Either way, try the camera trick.
---
I found a base the other day that was underground. Took me 15 minutes just to figure out how to get into the fuckin' place. The listing on the map said they had a lot of what I was looking for. Finally find the vending machines (tucked behind closed shutter walls), and then after ALL THAT, they were empty :)
---
No in the lore its a weapon made with a laser rifle
---
microsoft likes their services to work though
---
The 50 cal is very versatile, instant firepower with no spin up. Angry turtle did a review of all the heavies and the 50 came out in top 2 I believe. Ammo is decent as well, especially if you prime it.
---
While i do agree that taking out the daily and weekly atoms wasn't so smart, the fact they were giving atoms for FREE to you every day and week makes no sense to the "bait and switch" you are talking about.
---
I hate Yao Guai's too. I would try to one-shot them or reach a roof with my jetpack, if there is a roof. My friend would get so pissed at them, it's kinda funny.
---
Honestly i like it like this. Really cuts down on the memes and shitpost.
---
Bruhh I cannot stress this enough it's so annoying
---
r/fallout76settlements would be a great place to show it off to us less imaginative folk
---
How could we possibly port fallout 4 resources into Fo76 unless we *checks notes* charge more money.
---
At least wait that someone respawns and doesn't go back for it lol
---
sounds like some real raider shit
---
About 8000
---
I like this idea
---
Why?  If you drop your junk for any reason it’s fair game. 
---
You can’t steal from the ground.
---
Nice! Yeah, I did hear about those as rare rewards. I've been playing since the BETA and I still have only ever obtain one claim ticket, which I couldn't find in my inventory, and it was from completing Radiation Rumble. I know I had it because I was able to turn it in to the Bell Hop.
---
EDIT: Turns out they are under Misc and listed as "Pleasant Valley Claim Ticket". I just got turned in two and got the Patched Suit and the Western Chaps Outfit.
---
Literally just ran all around someone's house before they did the 'come here' emote at their vendors.
---
I ended up with some 200+. However, since I've been paying a lot less due to work recently I've burned through mine and now I just hit 0 today.  
---
  
---
I do agree though. Out of all the timegating, this is probably the most annoying.
---
obviously you can - Monster Mash is good for it too - but I know not everyone is interested in Nuclear Winter/PVP in general; those who aren't but still want the platinum (for example) would find probably find it much easier to grab a friend get it done in 10-15 minutes vs a potential grind in NW.
---
There was one that someone made a haunted maze and at the end was their vendor. Their stuff wasn't that great but the maze made it worth it.
---
Nah man, it's shady, but let's agree to disagree
---
What are they under? MISC? Even though I apparently had one, I couldn't find it in my inventory. I only know I had one because the Bell Hop accepted it. EDIT: I found them under Misc listed as "Pleasant Valley Claim Ticket"
---
Naw no worries, I should have paid attention. :) Yeah it would have been nice if they had launched across the board at the beginning.
---
As far as the achievements now, I’d say ground zero is probably easier because you don’t have to be the one to do the quest — you can show up at someone else’s nuke and get the achievement. So theoretically one person can drop a nuke and ten people can show up and get the achievement. Meanwhile each individual has to do the Foundation one themselves.
---
Don’t take it personally if people reject gifts like that. I can’t speak for everyone but I’ve never liked taking handouts as a new player, I’ve always preferred to play these types of games only with quest rewards, loot from mobs I’ve killed myself.
---
You got it.. the Flatwoods monster.
---
Yes.  Charleston would be great...retexture wavy willards and raise the water level..... Another poster mentioned a mire map which would be cool too
---
That may be so, but it hasn't stopped me from keeping on the lookout. Though, I still have not seen them in my inventory. I only knew I had one because the bell hop accepted it.
---
No, they have shown time and time again that they do not play this game, at all.
---
Nice! I gotta keep trying then.
---
Nah, man. It’s part of the game. Therefore it’s not shady. 
---
We aren’t talking about trap camps that use stacked punji boards to damage other players that aren’t flagged for PvP. That’s shady. 
---
Picking up dropped loot isn’t shady. Get over it and go get more junk.
---
My friends about to start it, your more than welcome to join our server.

Idiots never change. Only idiots are new. Yet it is not the idiots, but the men who handle them, who win victories.
---
I agree with all of this, but on the subject of loading screens; I'd rather Fallout 76 wasn't so heavily reliant on fast travel. Sure it's good that we get given a massive playground but it's not exactly fun or a positive experience to be constantly fast travelling every few minutes after each..."quest" and i really do use the term 'quest' loosely
---
Edit; spelling
---
he’s a liar
---
Seems so
---
Hit us with a picture tour.
---
If you've completed Rose's main questline, at the end you enter a security controlled room that has a robot bell hop in it. Rose mentions something about it being very hard to get the claim tickets but that if you find one you can turn it in to the bell hop for some (supposedly) great rewards. However, most of the time you get a common reward which is not much.
---
Well my plan was to pick a weapon type and play style and build my perks around that (in addition to obtaining other perks that don’t pertain to my build like the one that allows permanent mutations or better carry weight etc).
---
I just wanted to make sure I didn’t need some like super optimized build with crazy synergy and what not. I just wanted to stick to a main combat style and build around that.
---
i have NEVER had the horde wolf be a legendary, which always struck me as odd that he leads a pack of 3 legendary wolves but he himself is always a regular old weenie wolf.
---
Open up the xbox menu and make a post in the LFG page. I'll join if the server isnt full
---
I still enjoy it, but that first time..... 😀
---
Lmao amen brother
---
Wade IX 
---
GT^^^
---
Apparently I must not know where to find them in my inventory. I have 'Claim Tokens' but have not seen any 'Claim Ticket's. I've been looking because Rose mentions it in at one point in her main questline, back when the game came out in 2018.
---
I walked all over a team mate's base today trying to find it, only to never find it. I even jetpacked to the roof to see if it was hiding up there, went underwater to see if there was a secret entrance... nothing!
---
If you want people to buy stuff then let us see the shops! I'll move on if I don't find your camp within two minutes, i've got better things to do than waste my time finding your store only to see you've got plans I know or 1000 mounted shits, and overpriced ammunition
---
Ward:...You do realize that people were doing suicide via nukes since the game was released, and that the Wastelanders update was just released last April, right?
---
Dont know about you but the first thing to pop into my head if something vanished would be "Oh shit x y z went missing", it couldve happened way before that point and you just never noticed
---
It wasn't aimed at you in particular.
---
I’ve got 300+ levels in 300 hours on the game
---
the repair 10 weapons is annoying. Call me cynical but it feels like they want to try to clear some of the hoarded repair kits. Cus ya know, the atom shop.
---
Otherwise its just a stupid challenge
---
The limit was originally to prevent pvpers from becoming too OP. now I think it's just a relic from a lost time: most people don't pvp.
---
Sorry i was just trying to make sure before I wasted my time making another character
---
If you’re on ps4 I’d be happy to go claim ticket hunting with you. One of my friends got another fancy pump and it turns out it doesn’t have set legendary effects
---
Unless you go on your inventory. And you DROP the power armor it will never be stolen. 
---
You can place down the power armor in order for you to get in it. Or to modify it. But if you drop it, like you drop junk items. Then yes. Anybody can grab it.
---

---
Ran it as a group of 3. Got 4 legendary spawns (2 were 3*), 2 treasury bonds, some xp and caps, and most importantly a pepperoni roll that counts as meat for carnivore doubling (nothing like +60 carry weight for 1 hour).
---
YOU.
---
ARE.
---
WRONG.
---
But upvote for contributing.
---
I love OVN, but I think it’s hindered by the lack of group/event pools for experience and loot. The much can be same to all events in FO76
---
Yup!  Well done, mate!  You never forget your first time!
---
I'd rather see a different type of PVP format instead of another map for NW first.  Capture Flag, Hold Resources, timed games with objectives versus play until you die and then rejoin.
---
Edit: typo
---
Que?  What's this about Samuel? Where do you get that info from? I've never heard it before and I'm dang interested to know more!
---
I solo. Happy to help.

---
Do the right thing and free her
---
You are only complicit in the crimes if you do nothing
---
I have 50 of those useless 'supply' holotapes marked at zero caps, if people come to my shop and don't see anything they want or need they can simply take one and get the SCORE for free!
---
I'm glad I didn't have to buy a singular shotgun shell today, people were actually buying things after I moved my base to a more map centric location(The lake north of Foundation!)
---
The main quest is always fantastic but its anticipation lies in a semi-predictable arc. Or at least big parts of it are. For that big plot feeling. 
---
The gems and the lore and the favourite parts always retold to others are the side quests. Or sometimes even things you stumble across. 
---
Like the mother and young woman i found along the savage divide one time
---
He was probably tired of her ptsd monologues🤣
---
I don’t disagree with complaints here but for the past few weeks this page has been spammed with petty complaints. And i mean SPAMMED. And i mean PETTY. But yes i agree, constructive criticism is necessary. If we throw a million and one things that the people want at Bethesda, it’s bound the necessary things won’t get fixed.
---
It’s about tree fiddy.
---
Wouldn't it have been easier to type this into google and wait 0.21 seconds for an answer, rather than making a post and waiting over an hour just to get a snarky comment? 🤦‍♂️
---
2 fucking feet. Killing everyone. Absolute big brain.
---
Trash pandas unite
---
That worked like a charm for me. I also whitelisted the game folder in my AV
---
Stay off the pylons
---
Skyrim did snow pretty well shouldnt be too hard to implement
---
As someone who personally loves pepperoni rolls, this genuinely is the best part.
---
I’m the friend telling you, hey you’re complaining too much. They love you. Get therapy.
---
That would explain alot. I'll be honest, I think Todd preserves their dignity by being the face of Bethesda. 
---
See, all the hate goes to him, but not the developers. They get cut some slack, he doesn't, because he keeps his face in the TVs, even when shit hits the fan. I've never seen him accuse his developers of fucking shit up. 
---
I personally think that's a very honourable thing to do, because most CEOs don't even use their products, rarely show their face in public. Todd, despite millions of pissed off gamers (myself included), STILL has the balls to do interviews.
---
That's exactly it, the level up once a day is what ruined it for me.
---
Don’t you lie to me. Don’t you put that on me Ricky Bobby.
---
At least your honest mate lol
---
Uh... okay?
---
Well, I gpt one wuestion for ya.. Who's the Foundation? I'm almost Level 40.
---
This and the Bethesda splash screen is the first thing I did its not even a mod just an edit of the .ini file
---
2 atoms have been deposited into your account.
---
The last one itself isn't a legendary and I agree that it's weird.  I think you always get a legendary for completing the wolf horde quest.
---
Flatwoods has more hilly terrain, so quite often whoever has the high ground gets the kills and the win. Or you die during the circle shrink because you cant get higher or to safe terrain.
---
Morgantown has a much more varied terrain, with more options for engagement.
---
I also find Morgantown easier to navigate because of increased cover.
---
And more options for loot, but maybe because I know it better.
---
Friendly fire and a Shishkabob heals them up!
---
My best experience is just crafting the ammo. I had to switch to a prime reciever so i could make more than x27 a time. With Ultracite 2mmEC you can craft x180(i think), only issue is keeping on top of that crimson flux. Keep in mind Ammosmith &amp; Super Duper if you can :)
---
No apology needed. I'm a confrontational type. Get it? Because I type in a confrontational way...
---
😜
---
All seriousness, Beth confirmed that progress was tied to your profile. So, just try to keep up with official posts by them on the official fallout.bethesda.net page and also, try to use some basic logical reasoning. It really should be something that every person should try to practice. You know, for like, the continued progress of our species and shit. Okay, I'm done busting your chops. Have a good one on Glitchland.
---
she might be into that, don't judge
---
It's nothing I can prove but other people in Foundation say that he's from a vault but absolutely nothing about the guy really supports that. Anyone who came from a vault would be wearing a vault suit or a pipboy, but he's decked out in nothing but Vault Tec apparel. The guy looks like a Vault Tec rep. Personally I'm certain he's just making up a story to sound cool.
---
They were a real pain for me, until I got a shotgun that does extra limb damage. Stack with Enforcer, I knock out the feet and they just sit there roaring at me.
---
You do realize that Wastelanders and 76 were both released at the same time on Steam, like the title of this thread specifies, right? 
---
Obviously not.
---
Rofl no one is ever justifying the extremists. Only basic discontent
---
That's a daily i would enjoy
---
What did you say? Need help duping?
---
If that's her kink then that's fine. But I know for a fact that nowhere in her dialogue tree was there a line consenting to this.
---
But yea you should
---
I always vote flatwoods just for a change of pace. Plus the bushes are so much better in flatwoods. Us bush wookies can totally vanish there.
---
Probably around 12-15,000gold if you want it fully modded too.
---
Xb1 herr, I logged off about 10 minutes ago but started noticing a lot of lag
---
I know I just don't like switching up that perk unless I'm doing PP. I can keep them 100% no problem. I would just like to skip the search part. I was told that only determins the amount of caps.
---
Protip: pressure plates and powered doors
---
As a Herbivore that subsists on Doggo-meals of the Canned subtype, I'd say probably not.
---
He never leaves it.  Laziest person in Foundation.  What a scrub.
---
&gt;just sit on the D and hope someone is collecting Uranus
---
uhhhhh
---
I think it would be cool if the photomode settings could be somehow integrated into the prosnap deluxe camera. I love that wee thing.
---
That sneaky imposter Sasquatch bitch always eludes me.
---
Side quest and rabbit holes, the dude abides.
---
Kill some random scorched, pick up their already damaged weapons, repair.
---
The reason you aren’t allowed to do that, is because each character needs to complete the vault raid. In order to unlock treasury notes/gold. 
---
So it’s not fair that your level 200+ character unlocked every good item in the game, and then you switch to your level 5 character and get all those treasury notes and gold as well. Just like the tadpole and possum badges and challenges.
---
Go to lucky miner hole with excavator, there u can farm a lot of leads. Equip scrapper, kill mutants in West Tek, Huntersville n scrap their assault rifle for iron, or join the Real Blast Event in Abandoned Bog Town, kill as much mutants as possible, dun finish the event directly
---
But beware of the ammo weight, I once owned 15k of 2mm, cost me 50 inventory weight with fully upgraded Batteries Included perk
---
yes that's the one, sometime SQB teleportes around the map
---
This is such a good idea, although im afraid they would get boring and repetitive after playing for a couple weeks
---
That’s why I always play solo during nw, that way if I die it’s not because of a low rank teammate
---
Those eat so much budget though
---
Oh, thank you. Finally something that worked.
---
That’s just by turning off the auto fill right?
---
Really? Hadn't noticed
---
You’re joking, right?  Why would this be a concern for you?
---
Does she even say anything other than "Oh! Visitors!" and the whole "Just why" line? Maybe she's locked away for being too dull.
---
At least outsourcing it to India gives you the excuse that you've outsourced it to India.
---
Same cannot be said for the current situation at Bethesda.
---
lots of sneaking and V.A.T.S
---
It’s honestly better when randoms just die lol. Not to be mean but I’d rather solo than have 3 level 1-10s. I just won with 13 kills doing just that lol
---
I locked my doors to avoid that, but anything the players may needs is available outside
---
Thanks!
---
Yup
---
Also feels like a potential trap
---
Excuse me. I asked a friendly question. It would be polite of you to answer.
---
I’ll have to consider going solo. See how that works out.
---
Don't snooze on those bashing damage weapons.  If heavy or Shotgun, they might be better than you think.
---
My CAMP budget is full &amp;  the only functionality it has is for showers etc.
---
to be faaaaaaair
---
You're right, but I just don't care. Looting in FO76 is REALLY frustrating sometimes.
---
ok Thanks!
---
There were supposed to me more aliens besides the Flatwoods monster, however they were scraped. They even appear in the guide book.
---
Also use gauss minigun only when facing slow n tough enemies, always have a Gatling gun or Plasma caster to pin down weaker n faster enemies thus save the precious 2mm ammo
---
I’ve thought of doing that but then I feel like I could use the extra bait. Have them walk in and I clean up lmao. But when they shoot pulse mines it really makes me reconsider.
---
I would lock my doors, but then there would be no point in having my CAMP the way it is. I love having people check it out, its just annoying having people who dont know how to close a door.
---
Happened to me twice when I sided with the raiders on my alt.  At the point where Johnny had an accident.
---
I miss the days when you could just.pickpocket the item and run...
---
They should rebalance the existing underwhelming energy weapons 1st before adding more
---
I know what you mean. It's time to add self-close doors hinges in the game.
---
Haha! if only. Insert atomic shop joke [here]
---
i perfer regular guns, energy gets mehhy most times.
---
but i have all kinds, i ususaly run chainsaw and ripper also
---
Personally, I have never understood why some players have some obsessive compulsion to have to go into every other players' private rooms. Especially if they have already put all of the workbenches and everything else outside, for everyone to use. My whole first floor is open, with just one back wall and half of one side wall.  I have a bed, small water purifier, refrigerator, stash box, scrap box, ammo converter, guitar, cooking station, water pump, weapon bench, armor bench, chemistry bench, brewing station, power armor station, radiation shower, and golden Mr. Fuzzy all sitting out in the open for everyone to use.  I intentionally set it up so that everyone would have everything they might need, if they are adventuring and don't want to go back to their own CAMP.  The only thing on the second floor is my private room, because I sometimes like a little privacy.  I especially do NOT like sleeping to get my XP boost up, just to have some random moron come by and tea bag me in my bed (yes, it has happened before I finally decided to have a locked room).
---
If everything you need is outside, and you know you can't take anything anyway, then why do some players need to get into someone's tiny private room so badly, when you have a whole world you could be exploring, and you won't gain anything from invading someone else's privacy? It reminds me of when I was raising children, and the only things they ever really wanted were the things they couldn't have. LOL :D
---
Relatable!!
---
(I think they're joking for roleplay purposes which is totally fine)
---
I have no proof of it but I swear they made it easier with wastelanders. I too tried since FO3 and never got one. After wastelanders I got 3 over the course of 4 days. Haven't really tried since.
---
Every game needs its salt thread
---
I thought so at first, but then OP mentions ‘real person in the basement’. 
---
If it was just ‘role play’, why break the fourth wall?
---
Whenever I see junk on the floor. I take it. Regardless if it’s something I need or not. It could be a bag with 37 spoiled meat, and I’ll still take it. If you got killed by an enemy, that really sucks. I’m assuming you didn’t get a chance to store your junk. Or it was full blah blah blah 
---
I know if I die, and there are players nearby. There’s a 90% chance somebody will take it before I even spawn. So I do the same when other people die. 
---
Funny story. I went to flatwoods once and this level 5 and his level 6 friend kept hitting and attacking me because I was selling stuff to the vendor bot. And I guess I took too long? They must’ve not realized that after level 5 you can start fights with people. So I shot one of them. They both turned hostile. One guy I killed in less that a second with a bloodied double barrel. He didn’t have any loot on him. The other guy ran away from me. But of course no way in hell could he outrun me or outlast me. So I “waved” at him. And gave him a “heart” I guess he assumed that was me saying we were friendly now. So he waved back. I took out my MIRV fat man. And watched  as he tried to run away only to get slaughtered. His body actually flew away with the explosions. I waited until he respawned, and ran towards me to pick up his junk. I walked over to his paper bag. Collected the 23 wood scraps, 16 steel, 17 screws, 2 beer bottles, and 17 plastic. Then his character just disappeared. I’m assuming he left the game.
---
I personally don't agree with the raider philosophy, but I rather have them at my backs than a gossiping snooty foundation settler. That being said, I still prefer aiding with foundation because I like their city better.
---
You're welcome.  Have fun exploring and adventuring!  :)
---
I just took a random melee (junkies lead pipe) that I had picked up and used it at whitesprings.  After bashing about 5 ghouls, I ran to the fire station and repaired it.  Repeated 9 more times.  Was easy and I was grinding XP the whole time.
---
I agreed with u man, the daily cap of gold for maintaining the online player activities is overencumbered
---
I did the quest and got my own Fixer eventually. It was a higher level yet still somehow was weaker than the one that the guy crafted for me!
---
So from a similar thread, someone mentioned to use the camera to "scan" for the legendary monster and then move your way towards where it says the legendary monster was. It's pretty tedious, but it usually gets the job done.
---
There's also the "Your the dumbass" notes. I keep a good stock of those for griefers
---
I have her wearing a prison collar and the marine wetsuit and some kid in my party chat said i need to make a torture room for her but the best part is that he doesn't understand what he meant by that.
---
Don’t expect people to read anything.
---
My assumption was that they were referring to Daguerre as the real person, but i guess it could mean either of our interpretations 😯
---
You can't kill anyone under level 5 anyways, so I don't know what that level 2 was doing.
---
I love this.
---
I'm almost positive there is some icon I'm missing that let's potential customers know when I'm fast traveling.
---
I blame ward.
---
i miss that event  - it was my favorite.
---
I'm confused, what about the challenge you can repeat. That would make it capless right?
---
Did I stutter!?
---
....Aaaaaand it’s still broken.  Guess they got my $13 for this month.  Definitely cancelling FO1st, bunch of lazy ass BS.... 90 days and they can’t or don’t want to bother fixing it.
---
Hey sorry to hear that. But to be brutally honest. I don’t think anything can be done in your case. Besides not getting points for the nuclear winter challenges. And not being able to complete the Gold star 5/5 challenge as well. That’s all you’re missing out on. You have other daily challenges you can do, along with the weekly challenges. Not only that, but assuming you’re playing for more than an hour. And depending on your perks and what you do, you can level up usually 2-3 times per day. You get score points after getting a certain amount of xp. 
---
Bethesda obviously added the score system. Because although it doesn’t work in your case, there are people out there that love nuclear winter. And they deserve a chance to get some score points for playing their favorite game mode as well. 
---
Unfortunately in videogames. You can’t please everybody. So although it would benefit you, it would piss off a lot of people. Upset them. And ruin the fun and experience for them. 
---
I HATE nuclear winter. Absolutely hate waiting 2-3 minutes in a useless lobby where people punch each other. To finally find a game where I can either die within 10 seconds of me spawning. Or make it all the way to the end fighting/hiding in a bush. But I try my best to do certain challenges.
---
True. Hopefully it’s just RP.
---
The "Revive 2 players" was BS. I find someone who also needed it, we spawn near a cliff. I jump off twice, he revives me. I say "Your turn." He logs off.
---
Literally 10 minutes before reset, a level 2 on my team sticks his head up behind a wall, gets shot and drops out of sight of the shooter. I crouch to him, revive him, and bless his pointy head, he looks over the wall again. If it hadn't been for that,  I wouldn't have gotten the challenge done. 
---
Total playtime for that challenge, 9 hours.
---
"Numbness will subside in a few minutes."
---
What is they were like "I need some snark in my life...".
---
=)
---
I do exactly this, lvl 259 on this particular alt. Bloodied/Unyielding/shielded Vault Suit, the cranberry stuff. Stay Well rested, hydrated and fed.  Put your ally in your camp to get "Lover's embrace". Run Herbivore,  meat does nothing so I eat Cranberry relish and Brain Fungus soup.  Brain bombs take too long to accumulate.  My INT is above 40, and that drives XP gain, not strength.  I can level in 45 minutes or less grinding DMV/Whitesprings/Westek, hopping and repeating.  It is even easier on a private server.  I don't even use Strange in Numbers or Inspirational.

Proof of concept:

They fucked up almost everything about the endgame with Wastelanders.
---
They added a bow that was useless, and a compound bow that's even more useless because all the skins for the bow wont work on it, good job bethesda. 
---
They added an overpowered new range of weapons, which was good. But they only added 2 heavy guns, a pistol and a shotgun. Even though the most common build people use is for fucking **rifles**. So, what...anyone that uses heavy guns or shotguns gets an amazing new weapon that looks fucking awesome and deals a fuck ton of damage, and everyone else...gets to keep using the same boring handmade rifle or fixer they've had for a year.
---
We all run around in a witch costume, mask &amp; a cultist dagger, and find people on the map. Travel to them &amp; our high priest reads “summoning the mothman”. If they agree to join, they are equipped with the outfit &amp; welcome to join us in finding new members. We had a successful run tonight &amp; recruited about 80% of the server. If your on PC &amp; know that the mothman is your god, feel free to join the cult. 😂
---
There's a sub for that now?
---
why was this removed
---
i don't think i've ever gotten a legendary for finishing either, but i'd have to pay a bit more attention to be sure.
---
My luck is so high most of their weapons are at 100-125% condition
---
take my upvote
---
If you're wearing unyielding gear then it's time to get naked.
---
Oh your talking about the game.
---
Thought you meant the idiots not wearing masks in the crowds.
---
For the 9 creatures, I didn't have much luck in Morgantown. I got the Flatwoods map, spawned at Wade Airport and crouched my way to Sutton. Picked up the 9th by the overseers house.
---
I was like “I WANT TO JOIN PRETTY PLEASE” then saw “pc” 
---
But that’s awesome and creative.
---
Free her! 🙁
---
That time was what made me unsub from r/Fallout for a while because it just became a massive circlejerk for the longest time. The game isn’t perfect and tbh only issue I had at launch was the bugs which i kinda expected since its Bethesda. Even through that I had fun dicking around with my friends on launch night and we laughed our asses off until 1 or 2AM
---
You can start a grassroots cult like we did on your platform! All you need is a high priest read the summoning &amp; seamstress to craft the dresses &amp; dagger.
---
I too enjoy this event. Dare I say, it is my favorite. On a good day I’ll do it 5 or 6 times, on a great day too many to share :) Please say more nice things about the best event
---
I find the best thing to do when you're getting garbage legendaries is to change servers and see if you have better luck on another one. I landed on a server yesterday that had legendaries everywhere, not terrible things, not great, but they were everywhere - and actually did get a decent Furious Power Fist.  The server I just left a little bit ago, was Nocturnal everything. I got a Nocturnal Pitchfork from One Violent Night and several other Nocturnal pieces from various mobs - that stuff can't be accidental.
---
I blow up cars, trucks , and vans whenever possible.

Next time don't buy the fucking 200 dollar nylon bag. Everyone knows that only rich Saudi Arabia princes who don't give a fuck buys the "Collectors Edition."
---
OR financially irresponsible fools. 
---
Like you! D:&lt;
---
P.S, it's also your fault for preordering a Beta Release game. I actually waited 2 years and for a very heavy discount, and now I'm enjoying this game. It's still buggy, but far better than beta release.
---
That's your fault for being the guinea pig.
---
P.S I mean what are you even going to do with the useless helmet? I bet it's not even made of real metal!
---
That feeling! Congrats dude
---
Comrade Snarky reporting for duty 🥳
---
"They sent a whole army after us!"
---
No Eugenie, they sent two dogs.
---
That’s why we want it unlocked in a week. Your comment makes no sense. If the game is broken as shit then throw us a bone instead of a boner.
---
Ah yes because paying employees is magic.
---
whatever you do, stop it now. take your time, enjoy the early game. there’s absolutely nothing in the endgame worth speeding through the game for
---
*Spoiler free*
---
There’s only two factions that you can be an ally with. And yes. You can achieve max status with both factions. You will never turn either of them hostile towards you. 
---
HOWEVER you can only finish the story with ONE of the factions. You can’t do it with both. So at some point in the game. You’ll get a mission for both of them “Siding with Crater” or “Siding with Foundation” whichever side you go with, will permanently lock you out of being able to do that mission with the opposite faction. 
---
So make sure you figure out with faction you prefer to beat the story with. 
---
BUT DONT WORRY.  You can still unlock/purchase every weapon and item for both factions. It will just take you time to get more reputation, and obviously the currency needed to purchase plans.
---
The stimpak challenge is easy as can be... You find stimpaks in pretty much every other box and you can damage yourself to use them with explosive bows... The bows are incredibly common on Morgantown (I did the challenge in a single match earlier and I legit found three explosive bows before I even I even found six stimpaks)...
---
Pick some random spot to spawn, if other people spawn there, just run away and look somewhere else, you never even need to engage in PvP.  Same with the survival challenge, actually fighting with people makes completing that challenge take even longer.  Don't even loot, just go in the circle, find a bush to chill in, and then alt tab and watch Netflix for a few minutes... Keep moving into the circle and sitting in bushes, voila, challenge done, no PvP.
---
The only one that actually 'requires' PvP is the revive one, and I say require in quotes there because even that one doesn't actually require PvP either... If people on your team have mics plugged in you can just ask them to jump off something so you can revive them.  I can't be bothered to plug my own mic in to do that, so I just skipped that one.
---
Skipped the creature kill ones too.  They similarly require no PvP, but the spawns are RNG and I just can't be bothered to look for them.
---
I put one vendor that has like sale stuff in it that I want to move fast right out front on that yellow/blue checkered floor so it's easy to spot,  and my other vendors are in a building of their own.
---
If I spawn correctly....
---
A dude on mic was narrating his time at my camp. 
---
I took fall damage. What the fuck. Oh, resin.
---
I was in the same boat as you, played since 3, never found one until a few weeks ago at the pick I got one....a few days later walking around somewhere right out in the open....boom another pie!!
---
Agreed, grind up grind when the whole game has been that since the start
---
i’ll help you out after i get my bloodied double barrel. I know some really good places to farm enemies and get loot early game, whats your gamertag?
---
Sweep the leg!
---
My camp is a hotel on a cliff near Foundation (Hotel Cliffside if any xbox people are here and may have seen it). The vendors are all intentionally in the "lobby" so you can explore if you want but the main stuff is all very easy to get to.
---
I would have some vending machines setup. But I don't know if that bug has been fixed yet
---
They could add an effect for some of the cool masks or helmets in the game to have augmented tech to highlight dead enemies etc. Right now most of them are pretty useless effect wise.
---
Agreed.  I can grind 1000-1500 score in the same amount of time.
---
i wish you could display your power armor but it goes back into your inventory. it can’t be stolen if you just place it down normally btw
---
The only correct response to people emerging from the Vault.

Are you new here? They broke fast traveling like 7 months ago in an update, and have not bothered to even address it. They add new features that break things, and leave those things broken. Then, months later, add more features that break more, and leave those things broken.  Occasionally, if enough people throw a fit, they will "fix" some of these things. And those fixes usually break 5 other things and make the original problem worse.
---
Sorry... I was born in a barn. At least that is what my parents say when ever I do similar things in r/l. I usually just ask them if I was or not since they were there.
---
Unlikely.  If there are reward tiers it would be based how many lived, not their individual health.  There aren't any events that factor in health, just survivors.  That's assuming there are reward tiers, in some events the npcs surviving aren't requirements but just failure conditions.
---
Nope, full HP build. Just ended up fixing my gun every 4 shots or so
---
Long ago someone datamined and they had at least 1 more NW map, but development has sort of stalled since they pulled the team who worked on NW to assist with Starfield/Elderscrolls.
---
Both of the 2 new events are great.  It's a bummer they only added 2 new ones though.
---
your assumptions are wrong she wants to be locked away and naked.  ps it’s a game, it’s pixels, 0 and 1s
---
Morgantown has significantly more loot rich locations as well, with much more orange and yellow chest spawns.  Flatwoods has much less loot density overall.
---
try taking off the case and dusting it or letting it cool down
---
Thank you, I asked because that sounded fishy and one source confirms nothing in this game.
---
Mine works fine, but sometimes for whatever reason bethesda denies me the ability to sprint even with full XP and not overencumbered.  Switching weapons fixes it.
---
Ah, only the real intellectuals sell by weight.
---
I tip my tri-corrner hat at you sir.
---
lol my base 2 levels, no walls no doors, problem solved
---
Agreed. I also wouldn't mind a daily poll or something as well.  Might nip the same threads being reposted and a way to get some decent discussions going.
---
Think 1-1/2” metal ball, wrapped in leather, with a 6” flexible woven leather whip handle attached.
---
you see similar things modern versions using para-cord instead of leather, often in the form of a keychain.
---
We complain, most of us anyhow, because we care and want the game to be better.
---
If we didn't care about the game, we wouldn't play it so much. That's why its so frustrating and rage inducing that's its constantly in a state that fluctuates between bad and worse.
---
*puts vending outside* Soo uhh you play on PlayStation?
---
I keep handcuffs in my backpack just in case she starts feeling froggy.
---
Bruh, your commentting on a 2 month old post lmfao. You deserve a medal
---
I saw this too. I think maybe if someone else on your team sends an invite, everyone sees the message.
---
It's not a crime unless you get caught.
---
Dude I haven’t played the game in months but all of these were my biggest complaints. There’s really no reason for it to be so restricting. No MMO does it to this extent
---
Gauss shotgun in PVE is powerful because it's great in VATS.  You can't VATS in PVP, so a gauss shotgun at range isn't going to do so hot against a rifle perk loadout and will probably lose almost all those engagements.  In close quarters it is supposed to be powerful.
---
On Xbox it’s 0,33% allied with foundation and 0,7% with crater. Also one very interesting thing is that people that left the vault is only 75%! That’s just strange leaving the vault is so fast... I don’t get it
---
None of the bombs fell in this specific area whereas in 3 there were a lot that fell there, and in 4 it was nearby (glowing sea)
---
The game spawns in more NPCs the longer the match goes on and the smaller the circle is.  In fact, I just lost a match today because a ghoul literally spawned as I fought someone and landed the downing strike against me lol
---
From what i understand of the lore, Appalachia was the least affected area in the great war. FEV was a bigger problem in 76 which is why there are more mutated animals than radiation. We still get the odd rad storm here &amp; there, and the water/certain items generate radiation when you stand near them or interact
---
Edit, spelling
---
TLDR
---
Honestly, I think you are overthinking it with too much trust that the intent was for it to be ever reasonable, because it's clear to me the intent is to give you a freemium method to obtain Perk Points/Card Packs down the line. Seasons already does this to a degree with 45 Perk Points per season via the Packs on the board, which you can of course speed up by spending Atoms. But I imagine that's just a starting point.
---
because you open the window and it’s closest to click
---
Most of the ones you mentioned do in fact lower AP cost.  Can confirm.
---
I LOVE YOU DUDE!
---
Upvoted for originality.
---
That is not the same Motherload.  Those are closer to production models made from plans stolen by the Chinese rather than the prototype we know and love.
---
You can actually find it alive and well (though in really bad shape)  in the Foundation basement.
---
Its coming, been confirmed.
---
Nah, level 100 Season 2. 😋
---
I have  four rooms and a porch. Bedroom done as close to house as possible, murdery trophy room, cutesy trophy room, Beckett has a tiny bar on the porch, and the front room with entrance is done up like a Slocum Joe's with all the machines.  Stuck all the crafting into the train car.
---
I got a 3 star Bloodied Mr Handy buzz blade. I leaned in hard a embraced the rediculessness and enjoyed it. I also scored a quad explosive .44 I run around repeating Dirty Harry lines under my breath with the adjusted number for a quad. 
---
You just have to play with everything eventually.
---
Sorry I took your junk after I killed you when you were simply defending your workshop.
---
I'll try to capture video or take pics but I just gathered almost 50 caps. Including the ones from the ag center.
---
I wish more people would do it. I want to do it more often, but I rarely find anyone running it.
---
I have tons of junk for free and chems for one cap and no ones has bought anything in a week or so.
---
im farming rep for the crater... i never felt so angry with "not moving at all progress bar". hope it is ok if i change server like every 2 min.
---
so as for me i do
---
Oh shit...  Lol
---
Its July 10 and I am at the bunker and still can't get her to accept the flight recorder. Sort of getting annoyed but when haven't I been annoyed at the state of this game.. I used to code Dos games.. yea that's right I'm older than dust and this is a joke..
---
My last one I had a pretty little guest hostel but people kept milking my brahmin. I got salty, lol.
---
I've had emergency protocols drop twice from her (sold both for 49c🤦‍♂️) and I either bought the 3rd one or it dropped from another SB. I've never had the calibrated shocks drop
---
Ohhhhhhh, I guess I didn’t know there were plans for it. 🤦🏻‍♀️
---
Determining your preferred playstyle and refining a build that synergizes with it is IMO the most important aspect of becoming an elite player.  Anyone can slog around with a wimpy build and just YOLO'ing, but half the fun is experimenting with perks and maximizing your damage output and survivability.
---
Get a goal and start building your perks and mutations now.  Don't wait.  The game is so much better when you can kill things quickly and don't die a lot.
---
I feel attacked.
---
Great way to advertise new atomshop items though!
---
Except for Weapons Sunny.
---
He's the best Sunny - Because he suggests becoming a Raider.
---
I will say this.  Any 76er is welcome to repair and grab some water from the purifiers out back.  I even put in the effort to keep my nuka cola machine fully stocked with nuka cola.  All I ask is that you don't destroy my camp and that you don't shoot my pet deathclaw (Which I need to replace because a yao guai killed it while I was rebuilding and has no defenses up)
---
r/fo76FilthyCasuals
---
Hmmm
---
With Gamers it's always the wrong move no matter what you do, no matter devs don't talk to their fan bases anymore.
---
Ah ok
---
MODUS probably got it on lockdown.
---
God Bless America!
---
God Bless The Enclave!
---
Just don’t have doors. Problem solved!
---
I just wish the magazines that reduced AP cost didn’t take more bullets to kill enemies. Always have to go with the perforating mag because the enemies feel too tanky otherwise
---
This xD xD xD I save up all my atoms like a good boy... and when I'm semi asleep or just corny af I buy random useless but funny stuff xD (haven't bought anything I really regret yet so I'm not that bothered xD)
---
I'm at endgame, been playing since launch. Fallout First has revitalized this game for me. You can get through your junk collecting obsession, and farm all of the worlds workshops. It's akin to FO4 without Preston constantly on your ass about another settlement.
---
I use a power switch for the shower, so bloodied people who come to my camp dont get de-radded by accident. The pressure plate def has other uses though,
---
New problem; how will people be able to visit my camp, view my interior &amp; decorations, use my workbenches and cooking station, &amp; interact with my CAMP items?
---
I just started and so far it is great, albeit a lot of patches later. I live in West Virginia and it is wonderful to see places and areas that have a resemblance to places I have been and lived. Wish they had a Charles Town but Harper's Ferry was a nice local treat. Loving it so far.
---
I'm the same for thr shower, i recently made the switch to bloodied myself (finally). I definitely should look into pressure plates but I'll need to work around some stuff for budget.
---
New player that 100% agrees. I am loving the storyline and lore. Jason Mewes was a surprising VA addition. I had no idea. What a "Point Pleasant" surprise.
---
Listen, if I have to find one more stupid thing Ward lost I'll make sure the rest of them are at the center of that nuclear blast. I mean has nobody thought about investing in a lock or maybe a second guard?
---
Is this satire lmao
---
Make no mistake, there is no single act of theft that deserves death. But to clarify, in this case the theft from Foundation is just one small act amidst a continuum of the criminal and violent activities of this raider. Apart from this theft, he has at least aided and abetted the bushwhacking and murder of passers-by and homesteaders. The Crater raiders regularly admit to these crimes and brag about them--this is just a fact. The raiders can claim whatever they like, they may as well declare ownership of the Moon for all the good it will do them-- it doesn't change the fact that they will kill indiscriminately irrespective of whatever accusations they have against Foundation.
---
So, I suppose an even more interesting perspective would be to see a murderer near your home but dismiss him as just a simple thief despite all other evidence indicating that thievery is a minor hobby of his. His job is murder, and he knows the risks.
---
Shoot on sight.
---
Impatient person, forget it. Already rocking that power armor? Loser. Fuck em.
---
I've had a few times where my games bugged a bit and the green "glow" on legendaries was permanent... it was even active on the corpse so that was really awesome. Only once the corpse turned into a meatpile it stopped that glow effect... if they could just make this a permanent thing... that would simply fix the problem for everyone.
---
Btw I know it was a bug on my end, since the others in my team could not see what I was seeing...
---
Sounds like a simple option that is already ingame and would only need a small tweak to make it so... instead of "set legendary glow 30 seconds" to "set legendary glow permanent" xD something like that xD no clue how it actually would be server side xD been way too long since I did any programming xD
---
Well judging as how they were rude and using exploits to get score you were right in doing so
---
Roflmao xD it is much easier to mess up a fast travel to a nuke zone though xD
---
If this wasn’t Bethesda I would say your friend is trolling you.
---
You gotta take time into consideration too. 3 and 4 is 200 plus years after the bombs, 76 is 25 years.
---
It’s pretty random with the rewards at the end of the event. Getting all 4 supply crates only ensures more caps. Have zero evidence to back it up, but I seem to get more blue ridge stuff when we don’t get all 4 crates.
---
Agreed that it’s a great event too. Lots of action, potential for cool rewards, guaranteed legendary and treasury notes.
---
(laser musket misfire)
---
(character stands there, shaking furiously)
---
They want the game to be easier for new players
---
And the other one is juggling between cleaning, catering, coding and babysitting. I guess it should explain overall quality of the patches.
---
Lol I always shoot the cars when I speak in at valley galeria xD xD they have such a great domino effect xD shoot 1 in the middle of the car park and 90% explodes in a nice little light show xD
---
Also fireproof rank 3 is your friend xD you can melee a car to explode and not take any damage from the boom

I used to dream of being a pirate that would wield a mythical broadsider that could shoot two shots at once, and with me my two trusty flintlocks and a rapier to hit those who come close. But alas the broadsider failed me In the end with its shots bouncing of the Enemy like a fly attacking a stone wall, and the other weapons performing well but unable to take on the hordes of enemies befallen upon me

My build isn't for everyone, but..
---
There comes a point in your maturation in FO76 where you find that you don't need the absolute max specials in all the damage perks to still be tremendously powerful.  At that point, you can actually do pretty well with a balanced perk loadout that lets you be almost immortal and still deal 75-80% of the max potential with any weapon.  A Sneak, Jack of all trades build.  The one that people say is shit.  LOL
---
I am currently running 11,9,7,3,5,14,7
---
For example, I have 7 points in endurance.  Most would laugh at that, but I almost never die and I am running 19% health all the time.  With my build, I can switch cards and without buffs deal 10K plus with my power fist, 3k+ with my shotgun, 4k with my railway rifle, hit the SBQ for 300-500 per round with my fixer and have level 2 of each heavy card if I want to go heavy (I don't play much heavy).   Would I be more powerful if I maxed for a particular class?  Yes, probably 10-20 percent.  But at what cost in terms of flexibility and survivability? Do I need that to deal more damage than 90% of the other players? nah.  I'm perfectly happy being a jack of all trades and being able to kill anything short of the SBQ with any weapon with relative ease, hardly ever dying.
---
all the nukes being dropped will fix that
---
Despite the amount of 'wholesome community' bs you see on this sub, the game is chalk full of toxic thiefs. Whether or not its a part of the game, if the owner considers it stealing then it's stealing. If it's won in fair game (pvp, aggrovation) then yeah sure. But you got robbed dude. I'm a high level and when i see others take like that it pure cheeses me off.
---
Makes me proud to be the type that stands next to the bag for the victim to retrieve.
---
Lesson, though, scrap/store your junk as much as possible. If you have FO1st, take advantage of the scrapbox &amp; portable tent.
---
An answer to your question however; the satisfaction? Probably the same satisfaction that neckbeards get in YouTube comment arguments. A sad, greasy dorito-laden satisfaction. 
---
Also sorry most people on this post are choosing to argue against you.
---
Edit; if you're an XBOX player I'll be more than happy to provide some junk &amp; aid supplies.
---
Ive one 3 in the last month from machines. 2 from Camden park

Switching them off only stops your camp being displayed as a vendor. They can still buy. Better off letting them use your vendor and spamming them with nuke mines.

Never played it. Where does it occur? What happens during it?
---
Same error :/
---
Makes sense, I did scrap the one they were actively using and they didnt try the other two so I assumed it was because I killed the power. Oh well still denied them by scrapping the one with all the legendaries in it lol (double commented this cuz lazy)
---

---
SAMMEEE or you have been insulted that’s another good one
---
need them auto sliding doors, like at 7-11
---
Nah man, part of the game or not, it's still stealing. Game mechanics don't define what a theif is; principles, motives and moral and means do.
---
I mean it may be just me, but i don't think Bethesda gets to decide what 'stealing' means
---
That would be great for the new Slocum's Joe set.
---
Looking at it solely as an alternative to NW, doing your XP repeatable 4X per day gets you 400 SCORE per day, a total of 2800. All 7 NW dailies(1750), plus the weekly (1000) adds up to 2750. 
---
It’s not as viable a solution for lower level players who can’t grind XP as efficiently, but for most people who can handle bigger stuff—WestTek, Radiation Rumble, Whitespring, Fissure Sites and the like. 10k XP 4 times a day will almost certainly take less time (and be more fun for those who don’t or can’t enjoy it) than struggling through multiple NW matches. I’ve been hitting hit 2-3 times in one Radiation Rumble event. 
---
I’d honestly like to see it done as a do “X” in NW or do “Y” in Adventure mode challenge, but that’s not what we have at the moment. So it’s an alternative, not a perfect one, because it doesn’t work for everybody, but it can work for a lot of people. If it’s more enjoyable or accessible than NW, I wanted to make sure the OP was aware of the option just in case they weren’t already.
---
You would think that by now Whitespring and Prime would be nothing but molten lava.

It wasn’t on your person. It wasn’t in your inventory. It wasn’t in your stash. It wasn’t in your vending machine. It wasn’t at your camp.

It was on the ground in a public place. And there’s no way to prove to anyone on the area that it was pre-owner by you.

Abandoned items are considered open for salvage claim.

Picking up your litter isn’t theft.

Nope.  Dont even pay attention to them.  If I complete them, cool, if not, oh well.

I 100% agree with this guy. I been saying this shit for like a month too.
---
The Critical Drinker plays Fallout 76.
---
Omg the f’ing pipe pistols!
---
How do you mean?
---
&gt; Because everytime you log into the game, you have to look at the store.
---
Huh? What "store"?
---
I load into the 'News' screen every time. Do other people load directly into the Atom Shop or something? If so, there's definitely something wrong with your game.
---
I do the same. Since it’s on sale I figured why not go crazy and do 4. What a waste.
---
You're right! But in this case it wasn't 'abandoned litter'! Like i said its reason, means, principle that defines stealing, and in this case, OP got robbed! Thanks for understanding. 😊
---
That’s good to know, thanks!!
---
maybe your friend has a soft ban?
---
maybe your friend has their vpn set to different country server?
---
maybe someone at bethesda messing with you?
---
maybe synths?
---
Oof 😣
---
You can get some people to play with. Mass attracts mass. You don’t always need to be lurking for easy pickings.
---
If anything, Punisher would be added I think. Also Modular Tactical Outfits would be awesome
---
You should email daddy Todd this suggestion, maybe he’ll stop sniffing lines of skooma and take your advise
---
Make sure you're not using Rad-X?
---
Nope
---
Likely, due to their lack of help. Once I finished saying “no, that didn’t work,” 50 fucking times to their inane suggestions, they tell me that they’ll email me, but it never appears.
---
100% sure. It worked for a little but then went back to normal speed reloads.
---
I thought they were only in 4 and 76?
---
And for guys like me that can’t play every day...still only have 2 pieces of the secret service armor
---
I did the same, submit a ticket. They refunded me the 500 atoms
---
Honestly, if they're able to track data from Fasnacht I also don't see why they can't just track how many daily/weekly Challenges people have completed and then just award them the points 🤷‍♂️
---
They either don't care, or they are too stupid to do anything about the game's problems.
---
Your points add up to 56
---
The gun? You mean THAT gun? ;)
---
maybe im mistaken but im pretty sure i used to do it in fo3. There was one in the break room of the museam of history before you get the licoln repeater
---
Our factions may have been polar opposites but at least we share an appreciation for bunkers
---
You mean putting them at the bottom of the well guarded by trained Mirelurks isn’t easy to find?
---
I had never ran into a trap camp before today. I’ll never trust any other pressure plant in my life. Fun thing tho is that it didn’t kill me so there was that.
---
I hit 27 on Thursday, July 10, doing pretty much all the challenges every day up to this point. I missed 1 NW challenge on the second day because i was stubborn to play NW, but now im kinda getting into it. I didn't do the Friday Challenges yet, but im assuming that they will get me another level, i plan to do them this morning before the Saturday reset.
---
Interesting, nice!
---
same
---
And how is the person that picked it up supposed to know the difference?
---
Intent. That’s the key factor here. And you cannot prove intent. Does the OP have a confession?  Does the OP even know ***who*** picked up the litter?  Did the OP even ask?
---
The claimant is required to conduct some basic due diligence. And all the evidence is circumstantial and tangential, at best. 
---
If you can’t name anyone to be charged, then there was no crime committed. In come get until proven guilty. And at the moment, all we have it a alleged occurrence of someone picking up discarded litter. 
---
Any conclusions reached beyond that are supposition. And we don’t reach judgments based upon unsupported suppositions, good sir/madam!
---
Can we also get a perk that lets us kill headless ghouls?
---
4 floor house for me. All the good stuff is at the top after a bunch of climbing stairs and going though rooms. It is worth it though as everything is 25 caps or less. (plans, mods, recipes, ammo, aid, etc.) 
---
Just don't open the door next to the vendors that says employees only and do not enter, lights flashing and also a safety first sign.
---
You will take fall damage, land on spikes and risk a disease, then have to walk through the spikes to get through the next door to escape..... Into the irradiated River and then swim all the way back around the house, fiddling through my locked purifiers to eventually get back to land, risking more disease.
---
I mean, you were warned.
---
If your talking about the one where people could buy things that wern't for sell then yes it has been fixed
---
My main had the vendors in a small building easily seen behind his house. 
---
My medic has the vendor in a room marked pharmacy in her clinic.
---
Deciding to play with a power armour or no power armour is important as you narrow down a build path. Regardless if you plan to only have fun, or you are into some min/maxing. This decision saves you many points you can play around with. Deciding whether to focus on melee, ranged, or heavy will also make this easier. You can jack-o-trades for sure. But making a solid decision on the things mentioned help you save time on corrections later.
---
Use door frames but no doors.  Not hard, Sherlock.
---
It was weapons and armour... very easy to accomplish without using repair kits...
---
While it's nice that the S.C.O.R.E daily is bringing in more players, I'm starting to get annoyed with the endless teams of hopeless randos. I see many 100+ players in the lobby but somehow, match after match I get stuck with scrubs. 
---
I miss the old matches with 30-40 players with(mostly)decent regular players.
---
Yeah I've noticed I actually do better these days when I play solo. Just gotta be very cautious and smart about which battles you choose to fight. And hide well.
---
all robots take less damage in the head. after crippling it, go for body shots. the weakest spot for each robot kind of varies
---
Mr Gutsies take the most damage on their propulsion rocket
---
To what end though? My brother asked me this and I had no answer. I have no idea why I’m collecting all this stuff. I go to work every day for 9 hours and I come home to more work.
---
Casual, tho I do get several hours in most every day.  Only time you could call me 'grinding' for xp is getting a level for the daily.
---
Yes, i know intent is a key factor, in fact, that's pretty much what principle, morals, means and reasoning boil down to 😑 
---
Going by your logic, we're dealing with some Schrödinger's theif here. 
---
You're just too far in to admit that it's a common occurrence upon low level players &amp; is in fact stealing. Why would any high level take from a low level without having malicious intent? The intent is obvious from the get go. 
---
Please never say good sir/madam again in your life. Please. I grimaced immensely at that. And please don't tip your fedora.
---
Edit; I'm going back to my business. We all know it was intention of stealing. We all know it's a shitebag thing to take/steal from low levels. Nothing will stop the assholes from being assholes. And the way you presented yourself to OP during your lil argument was very condescending i.e "you've learned your lesson", which tells me that you are one of these shitebag players, too. Later.  ✌🏻
---
With one of the recurring legendary run dailies being using a player vendor, I could only imagine the backlash if they shut them down again.
---
that's fair but I did put 20 hours working and making the idea so here's a short summary 
---
(SUMMARY)
---
I talk about the daily quest and the steps 
---
and than I talked about the choice you can make at the end for different rewards at the end and I describe those rewards and what they do.
---
hopefully that's not too long for you :-)
---
Same at least the raider will say strait to your face if they don't like you.
---
The raiders are like men we brake each other down let em suffer for a bit and pick em up... Eventually.
---
The settlers are like women they will talk shit about a person but when the person they were talking shit about comes around they are all lovy doby
---
Wish theyd add a middle finger emote just for occasions like this
---
Delicious newb adhesive. We sit on the pile of your garbage like a dragon on his treasure.
---
What are you like level 5000?
---
Mines in a side garage with door kill power to door shutter goes down no access at all
---
Sup
---
Hahaha wow what a dumb idea. Way to let hostiles into your home. We got a real Watson over here, people. Clap. Clap. Clap.
---
I also take it you're the type to have no structure to your camp, too.
---
IGN:LanderDills
---
Try and grind until you get a few legendaries then exchange them at murmugh’s and try your luck for a good starter weapon if u don’t ah eine already then grind events until u can 2-4 hit level 48 super mutants then go to huntersville and go ham after that it should be a breeze to level up
---
To start fast travel to the right side of the big bend tunnel. Then talk to the boss he's on top of the platform on the right side of the tunnel. He doesn't always give you the mission. If you see a guard and a merchant standing around he will.
---
This is awesome and true. Didn’t believe it myself until I picked up the same thing killing a random raider. I’m on PS4, and have been doing this for a couple weeks straight. Almost to ally. Since I did the raiders first for the gauss minigun.
---
What system, might be able to give u one
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Bloodied?
---
Sent a request your way.
---
Good man! And good luck!
---
Sickk. I'll be on in like 15-20. Thanks!
---
An ammo workbench/crafting station??
---
Power pack and osmosis kit is better because it's under misc and can't get auto scrapped accidentally. So a warning to whoever gets the item, you can lose it real quick.
---
If you walk pass a car in game and the thought *i should blow that up* doesn't run though your head... We can't be friend's
---
I forgot to check back on this so yes can i use a psn card to purchase fallout 1st
---
I’m the kind of player that drops Stims and water and modded up Heavy Studded Leather Armor sets with Deep Pockets along with 10mm modded pistols and 250 rounds for brand new players, bud.  Even bought the pretty blue &amp; yellow wrapping paper gift bag for intentional drops. 
---
I help out new players. **But I abhor whiners**. 
---
So someone picked up your abandoned junk. Boo hoo. 
---
Your reaction tells me that you’ve been stupid enough to run around with junk and lost it because you planned poorly.  
---
Hell, you assume the high-level player **knew** who dropped the junk.  Such a bold assumption. 
---
There’s a thing called personal responsibility. 
---
And get over yourself. I was intentionally using archaic sounded language as a goof. You’re obviously quite thin skinned. 
---
Go scavenge your lost junk and dry your eyes, bud. It’s just a game. 
---
*Or are you ‘role-playing’ as a white knight, too?*
---
LOL
---
Don't take too long, I have to stand here until it's picked up lol.
---
Finally someone with the guts to help.
---
Odds are that some of them they got76 just to Review it.
---
Definitely synths
---
Wish they would make all the bodies easier to locate. Whenever I'm fighting 6 or more enemies and timing around in circles I always seem to lose one or two
---
Hah, maybe Id be able to max up 2(!!!) legendairy perks then when they come out
---
Nah, Im 255, I plan ahead on my leveling making sure I stop playing before Im about to reach a new level so I can do that daily sooner, but that aswell is just so stupid, im not being forced to do it but it does feel like it sometimes... Same if I have alot of heavy legendairies and no scrip to sell it for, I just log off and wait for reset
---
So yeah in my honest opinion I think its kinda a bad business model to encourage players to shorten game time and savour stuff like legendairies and leveling up
---
Having it happen to me was one of the best things yet in this game. If I can help just one other person avoid Ward's BS it's worth it!
---
Happens once in a while lol, but when it does its pretty funny
---
Are you feeling a little salty? Idc what kind of player you are lmao
---
Ok. Ill hurry. If you gotta go, no worries. I appreciate the gesture regardless.
---
Damn I never knew this. I got a power pack for mine. I guess they can just store it until they go turn in the quest.
---
Dude fo1 and fo2 are excellent
---
I see no one is responding. 
---
Therefore when i buy the game, i shall sacrifice myself for this noble cause.
---
Weird. Because you just jumped to an assumption about what kind of player I am based on a random conversation that was about 95% tongue-in-cheek. And jumped right in to save the day, since OP had stoped replying. 
---
Get over it. It’s a game, bud.
---
You’re the one that needs to swoop in like a ‘white-knight’. And it’s adorable.
---
Yes. Every time I fast travel to someone's camp I have to play 'Find the Vendor' and it's annoying. Now if it takes more than 5 seconds to find someone's shops I just move on to the next camp. I don't have time for your labyrinth.
---
No worries I'll wait. Someone said the scope can be scrapped, so I would advise keeping it inside a display case or unpowered, hidden vendor and only taking it out when you go to turn in the quest then putting it back in.
---
You could be like me. I have 4 accounts that I do the daily challenge with (except NW). I don't have any character under 100 (all 20 slots filled), so I'm having to level up 4 times each day.
---
Yeah, the turret board and the multiscope are classified as junk, so they can get scrapped and since they weren't meant to be kept, there's no protection when scrapping things. The other items I don't know about because I've never actually found them.
---
Thank you for your service
---
I wouldn't so much call it saving the day, as much as it is correcting some asshole who overuses the word "bud"
---
Get over what? The game? I'm playing right now i dont think I'll be over fo76 ubtil the next instalment. Bud
---
That sounds awful tbh, what are your thoughts on the daily then? Part of the grind or more a bother?
---
And odds are the BOS add in more heavy weapons. And maybee PA mods
---
Sounds like a pretty good guy
---
Also I weigh and extremely over encumbered 2x with PA on and 400 carry without
---
Friends and I did this regularly in the past. Pissed of a looooot of people! :)
---
Ok. Good advice. So I just start the quest with it on me and it completes?
---
To what end? To just have fun. If it's not fun, don't do it. It isn't a job, go play something else.
---
The only holos i keep are the games. I missing decent amount for the throphy. I only got nuka tapper and the gognak game.
---
I'm trying to go back to my business but you keep editing your comments and adding stuff in. And replying to me.
---
I’m not sure what that is I’m pretty new, it was just a regular super sledge. I have slugger maxed and a lot of end/agi so it was my main. They can’t be super hard to find
---
You prefer kid?  Son? Boy? Pal?
---
And for someone that was ‘going back to their business’, you sure can’t resist coming back for one more comment. 
---
I can *smell* the salt 🧂dripping from your skin...
---
If this is the funniest thing you've seen in a while, I'd suggest widening your comedic tastes. This is a reddit argument hahah...And not even a good one.
---
I’m on PC
---
Portable Power Pack is for sure a misc item and can't be scrapped. I've never found any of the other items besides the Multiscope though.
---
Well today I realized it was no longer fun for me. I’m hanging it up. Wish I hadn’t paid for the fallout 1st membership. I could have bought socks or food.
---
Not at home right now, but did you have to do anything special to fix your access revoked problem? Just covering all my bases here.
---
Says the guy that edited his own comments, lol.
---
Yoi should probably stop smelling (and clean) whatever your using Reddit on.
---
At level 101 I still haven't launched my first nuke yet. I'm working towards it at my own pace, and I'll get there when I get there.
---
 I did finish the wastelanders storyline though, and I make sure to do the settler and Raider dailies as well as the stupid robots pictures every day, and sometimes I'll pick up a few more treasury notes from events, but mostly I just wander around and do whatever the hell tickles my fancy at the moment. 
---
Sometimes that's working on the main quest sometimes that's seeing a place on the compass I haven't gone to yet and deciding that's where I want to go, sometimes it's wanting to see if there's an actual location corresponding to the graphics on the map in an area that looks sparse.
---
Regardless, I have fun and I'm not in a hurry
---
Yes, and tagged them as "edit: spelling" etc
---
He said he JUST started lol it will be a long time before he is getting any legendaries and makes his way to the Rusty Prick.
---
You’re right. You haven’t presented a good argument. *At all.*
---
🤣
---
Yeah as soon as you talk to Ward he'll say "I see you have our missing equipment" but it wont take the item from you. This only happens when you find the item just laying on the ground out in the wild.
---
Just hit 40,lunch boxes rock!
---
Ah sorry about the confusion I though he was a bit higher level
---
Sorry I’m on Xbox
---
If my arguments aren't good then yours shouldn't even be considered as worthwhile thoughts 
---
Also i get it, you're lolling and 🤣ing all over the place. So am i but i dont feel the need to present it in every comment.
---
Just yesterday I was heading back to camp from gathering junk to continue building my Slocum Joe's, and I see a lvl 3 leave the cafe. I am lvl 78, and he just starts wacking me with a machete. I just emoted question marks until he ran away and was ravaged by a mole rat a little down the road. Poor guy. Would have given him some gear.
---
That seems pretty damn convenient. Leaves more time for nw score. 🙄
---
Oh, sorry, didn’t know we had to use your rules. 
---
And yet, you’re the first one to get frustrated enough to jump to vulgarity. How adorable!
---
It’s amusing to watch a random white knight lose his cool.
---
I remember seeing someone in the communist armor with the backpack and ak skin. Then gets into PA with the communist paint and blasts the soviet anthem while charging a hill for an event. 
---
Been my role model ever since
---
Could I trade for some violet flux? I got caps, scrip, and I'll literally give you anything you would want lol
---
This was a T45 I wanna say so it's good to know that Liberty Prime's arch nemesis is style alive
---
You can craft one if you aren’t using a legendary variant
---
Odd
---
You also know that the game was released for PS4 and Xbox One back in 2018, right?  
---
Not to mention how simple it is to stand under a landing nuke compared to the tedious grinding for rep for both Foundation AND Crater (The latter being easier due to having more options to boost rep).
---
I'm saying don't single out Steam as the only source to make accurate statistics.  Console owners count too.
---
Side-note: I checked my achievements on the PS4, it's the same thing.
---
ATimmins05
---
You're fine and your friend is a liar. Do what you will with that information.
---
WHAHHAHAHAHA! It is I! I am the one going around to everyone's camps and leaving the door open! Behold my presence and despair! It is only a matter of times before the open doors drive you insane!
---
Now I am off to visit other camps and turn off all their radios and jukeboxes!
---
Seriously. And it’s like every fucking day now. Not every person with a level 200+ character wants to grind out a level a day or roll an alt.
---
I’ve been skipping it every day, unless I happen to be close to a level. Luckily, I don’t mind playing NW so I usually just get that challenge to complete my 5 for the day.
---
She talked about a person in a vault 76 suit on the radial too
---
buy a lottery ticket
---
How am i losing my cool? You're in this just as much as i am, &amp; just bc i dont say 'LOL' 10x per comment or slap a '🤣'here and there doesn't mean this isn't amusing to me. You're trying to justify thievery and laughing about it. You just look fuckin stupid to me haha.
---
Also yeah sure whiteknight or whatever cool. Sorry for being a decent person 😂
---
If you say so
---
You SCOUNDREL
---
Yes, I’m sure you are. 
---
How easily I struck a nerve. You randomly come across this discussion and can’t keep yourself from jumping in to save the day!
---
Like a little wooden puppet. Dance, Pinocchio. 
---
It’s time for my whiskey and cigar, son. We’ll pick this up later, I’m sure. Because you won’t be able to resist making a reply. Even though this comment has no edits at all. 
---
Make it a good reply. I’ll read it at my leisure.
---
Rumor was they were banned because of cheating at SCORE...
---
Revive was fun ... found a cliff, my friend &amp; I jumped off ... was working great... until some idiot came along who was actually playing NW and killed us 🤣🤣
---
So I guess the answer to my Moms question... “if your friend jumped off a cliff, would you?” Is YES, if I get a challenge reward 😎
---
So I assume you destroy the duped weapons :)
---
You don't seem to understand the difference between just griping and well-constructed criticism-based on a solid foundation of complaint.
---
In that case, I can't help you even slightly... So continue on with your rambling thoughts I guess. I'll just ignore you and hope you go away
---
What's your ign?
---
We, or at least I, never caught any. They get antsy if they see you, I guess.
---
Nothing is rare atm.  
---
Just hold onto it.  
---
Caps are useless.
---
caps &lt; scrip &lt; good legendaries.  
---
**Always.**
---
MojaveBreeze, same as on here. Got you added now.
---
I intentionally don’t spawn next to anyone on my team. I don’t consider them worth assisting until they survive the first contraction. I’ve been killed far too often by stupid teammates, so I want to see them survive at least 3-4 minutes before we link up.
---
I'm 200h into my 1st character and I still have soooo many stuff to do. I've been really enjoying the game despite all the glitches, bugs and stupid decisions by Bethesda, I really like to take my time with it, I even read everything to learn more about the lore (first Fallout game I'm playing) and to find some funny/interesting easter eggs. It's been fun
---
Big Bend Tunnel East, you have to start it manually unfortunately. Talk to the guy in the suit.
---
Ought to be added to the public event circuit imo.
---
Unfortunately?  It’s filthy fantastic
---
Yes, such a decent person to worry about three wooden scraps and five pieces of steel.  Your such a hero!!
---
How easily I struck a nerve. You randomly come across this discussion and can’t keep yourself from jumping in to save the day!  Had to strike that pose and slide intro the conversation. 
---
And you can’t resist from jumping when the strings are pulled, like a little wooden puppet. Dance, Pinocchio. 
---
Make it a good reply. I’ll read it at my leisure. 
---
Unless you decide to actually ‘go about your business’. Because remember, your ‘excuse’ for that was because I kept editing my comments. 
---
These aren’t edited. So what will your excuse be when you just **can’t** resist making another reply?  
---
Or are you not a man of your word?  Tsk, tsk.
---
That would make it more irradiated, not less.
---
The storyline quests are giving a lot of XP as well as companion's quests. But idk what level are you, so the companion's quests could be tough if you are under 35 I guess.
---
You can do the easy daily events in Camden's park (700-900xp as I remember), hunting queen in the mire (also about 700-900xp, if you are 20+ and have some stealth gear it would be easy), that event with super mutants on the dumb (forgot the name, in the edge with acid valley, it also gives a lot of XP and the enemies around 10-20 lvl).
---
This worked for me.Thanks much..
---
Nice. Says offline though? I need to join your sever, right?
---
I wish I could upvote you to the moon and back.  I’ve been chased from this Reddit multiple times for pointing out the out of control whining
---
Level 400+ and I can easily grab at least 1 level a day. Helps that I'm running Unyielding armor and my Intelligence is at about a 38 or higher sometimes.
---
Yeah just join mine. Not sure why it would say offline though.
---
My god you actually sound like some maniac from /gif/ or a YouTube comments section. How's the neckbeard? Your mum's basement warm enough?
---
You haven't struck any nerves man. You just look like a fuckin...well, a fedora wearing neckbeard...anyway later. Have fun reading this at your leisure or whatever. Im sure it means a lot that someone is talking to you.
---
Throw in as many white knights or whatever you want, nothing wrong with being a decent person who's been there before. 
---
Enjoy your whiskey, cigar &amp; gender assumptions.
---
Thanks much for the strategy tip.  I enjoy NW but I'm not great at it, so tricks for some of the potentially grindy challenges are always epic.
---
If you have 1st claim any workshop you can handle, build a few turrets and defend it straight away then come back when it says you have to retake it.
---
Already replied to your comment that's like 80% the exact same as this. 
---
I dont think you understand from OP OR I Though,  that it's tge principle. Not the items. God you're dumb or arrogant or both
---
Not really, I repair stuff all the time
---
Take your time and explore more rather than rush leveling and getting through the quests.  The end game things aren't nearly as fun as the experience discovering the world and slowly getting through the story.
---
Also, think about how you want to level up your character traits - it's a pain to switch things around at higher levels.
---
Just because you specifically don't do it doesnt automatically make it rediculous
---
And now I'm suddenly obsessed with figuring this out...
---
get a low level gun and bash cows with it. a couple bashes should damage it enough that you'll be able to repair it again.
---
Oh HoW eAsIlY i StRuCk A nErVe
---
dAnCe PupPeT dAnCe
---
😂😂😂😂 freak.
---
Medics doesn’t proc on any of my explosive weapons unfortunately. I have a fixer, handmade  and combat shotgun.
---
What’s your gt
---
it's essentially just a bloodied DCG. limb damage isn't particularly good.
---
Thanks for the offer! I'm only on PC 😐
---
Ah, thank you my friend. I could care less about your gender. 
---
But the fact that you can’t even follow your own rules, and you’re clearly not able to adhere to your own word, is sufficient for me tonight.  It’s an amusing dance, and you followed the steps well!
---
And here I thought you might actually show a shred of integrity and follow through with what you said you would do.  Slight disappointment on my end, but that’s life. 
---
Now run along, and worry about your unlocked doors.
---
If I get another cryolator or broadsider I'm gonna lose it I swear
---
I apologize, this does work you just need to set the properties of the file you copy to "Read Only" and you should be good to go.
---
I’ve been doing it since beta and never have problems. Doorframe with no door is also more inviting to other players. Who cares what you have locked behind a door? I have all the same stuff too as well as everyone else.
---
I would like a black/forest camo version of the Tactical/Camo Ops Underarmours.
---
Inb4 "Dark Blue is better for sneaking at night, Black's only good for total darkness."
---
I just want to see more colour/pattern variations of items that already exist.
---
Yes it's easy to do, and yes, Bethesda will overcharge for them, or make it a massive grind, but what else is new?
---
Whatever bud
---
Btw looking at my profile and pointing out a post i made isn't a weakness...just shows you like to play 'creepy detective'
---
Later. Run along now with those stimpaks and leather armors, sunshine. And dont forget your 10mm pistols 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
---
I'm not at home, but I linked my wife to this post and walked her though it, she got to the main menu! Thanks so much bud, hopefully there's at least some "real" fix soon, but this is awesome.
---
Lol, "This game's content is barren and lacks any substance so play as slowly as possible to give an illusion of longevity"
---
Yeah thats the one I was talking about. Well might as well set up my vendor again
---
Funny thing is I read a post of people complaining about there must be people duping at train stations because they are not letting them pass through the door way.
---
Humans are silly.
---
You can add your friend in your team in NW? How? I guess I'm gonna do this too instead of playing 😮
---
Bloody Unyielding build
---
I always click just once when I find the thing randomly, ended up getting one pie in my first (and only) silo run. 😂
---
Not gonna lie I've made a few new characters and leveled then to 3 and then delete and so the same thing the next day.
---
The same value as a 1 star Bloodied DCG. Maybe 1-3k caps if ur lucky. Find one with swing seex and that price jumps up a bit.
---
You might get 1k for it, you want it to have 40% faster swing speed as the secondary for it to be considered valuable, or 40SS and +1Str to be able to trade it for almost any weapon you want
---
since when did "hey look at this glitch and do it too" become a public service announcement?
---
When I looked into this about 3 months ago, it was not possible.  :(
---
I always wondered why they're disabled. It kinda pisses me off too.
---
Nah, I play games to escape people haha.. So I prefer to play with randoms.
---
Don't worry, you'll probably have enough gold for the next plan when you finally get a decent roll for the previous. 😂
---
...and the subreddit's content as a whole
---
Lol dang wish I found this 5 mins ago. Welp, 2 and a half hours longer
---
Invite to team from 76 Main Menu ... than whomever is the leader goes to NW.  Way more fun when with friends 😎👍🏼
---
They have them for workshops and during beta they also had them for camps. That got removed really quickly, unfortunately.
---
Lol well i meant when it's just me, but always assume everyone has a better weapon than me when doing events anyway. I seem to only get trash for legendary weapons, meanwhile everyone else is doing double my damage output.
---
I hit up the dam and the prison and picked up boards from the super mutants to repair
---
After i FINALLY got the full set of swag, i hung up the blueridge flag on my camp and figured i might as well just rp as a free agent blueridge mercenary. I went for a militaristic style fort type camp (the blue steel walls work reallly well).
---
I've actually found it to be a lot of fun lately after initially also hating it. Yea it sucks early on when you don't have a lot of good cards but quickly enough you get enough overseer tickets to buy any you're missing.
---
Honestly the thing ruining now has been the stupid players that keep dropping by themselves for some unknown reason (even when they're right in the middle of Morgantown). There are days where half the team each game solo drops and dies before ever linking up with the team.
---
Yao guais are easy but mr gutsies just dont die.
---
The circle varies on its damage output based on how small the circle is. Smaller it is the more damage the fire will do.
---
PC has the least amount of hacking. Xbox economy is fucked beyond repair from cheaters. PC is probably the best 76 experience you can get.
---
I created a new character yesterday. It took too much time to level up on my 177, can imagine your pain with lvl 255.
---
Im actually kinda new to going full rp nerd myself but that has helped me keep the mojo goin. Build a story around your character and base your clothing/camp off that. Makes things a bit more interesting at the very least.
---
It's a softcap. You can keep getting points, but you're much less effective at it once you're down to the repeatable.
---
When you're in workshop mode, you can move the camp thingie that looks like an old-school projector and that'll change the spawn point. From what I can tell, the spawn point is north-ish of where it's placed.
---
Yea just log on for daily challenge and 20 treasury note for daily gold
---
Whats so special about those things anyway? I see people vendkng them for crazy prices all the time. I know theyre rare but...is it just for display or something?
---
I was going to write exactly the same thing. It is as fun as sunday vacuum cleaning :D
---
I wish I could start all over again with no knowledge of the Appalachia, that was simplier, happier times :)
---
THIS‼️
---
Yep, damage is capped at 110
---
So the edge of the map will be the next popular spot 🤣
---
Dang, that kinda sucks. Thanks for letting me know
---
I totally agree. I loved the silver shroud radio it was the best.
---
Giving them out to friends
---
Not all of 76 is set in the Forest...
---
The Toxic Valley looks like your typical Fallout Wasteland. 
---
The Mire and Cranberry Bog are twisted and crawling with mutated creatures because of Radiation (and other things).
---
Even the Ash Heap is burning underground, and leaking the smoke to the surface, poisoning the air.
---
Then, consider that while above ground wasn't nuked as badly (if at all) during the War compared the the rest of the states; but did have nukes detonated underground, as well as the nukes launched to defeat the Scorched years later.
---
It might look like a pretty place, but it's falling apart underneath the surface, burning, rotting, mutating...
---
Sure, the water might be drinkable, and some grass might even be green. 
---
But the map is bigger than one place, and even the "grass" is trying to kill you in certain places/events.
---
So take a look around, head South or East, go beneath the ground and come face to face with the things that dwell within.
---
They should also do that to dropped loot bags
---
Agree, switch weapons and switch back and fixed
---
I haven't played 76 in a few months, but I know for a fact that I have an entirely separate building for my vending machines
---
And like, to defend those who have no problem with it, I have done it quite alot with my main, only 2 levels Ive done with and alt, but its just such a turn off, leveling up has been a passive thing for me, actively going for it is boooring and as said a turn off
---
I literally have been following people through my camp shutting doors behind them. I dont think any of them noticed lol.
---
Yeah I agree, I still do it, that and nuclear winter which I somewhat enjoy (wish it could have been a lil simpler than what most challenges have been but meh)
---
That's a good idea and totally viable play around with a bit of everything and stick with whatevers most fun for you. I'd normally highly recommend getting adrenaline (broken ATM) other than that try and grab crafting perks asap
---
It is all about time, don't have much of it to play. But I want that skin for SS armor on lvl 83
---
I do this too 😂
---
Yep. If you’re gonna pvp, it’s all about DPS.
---
I agree it's a problem but it could be fixed easily with a set spawn point place mat directly in front of vendors, but we all know that will never get added since people will abuse that by making trap bases. Not saying trap bases are bad just people will take advantage of the "fix" for vendors.
---
Yeah, luckily my build is flexible so I can easily go from rifleman to commando for PVP if I really need to.
---
Yeah I feel you, I have rather much time so I think I should be able to keep doing the dailies, but sometime when working late its really shit to come home and spend that one hour of relaxation on fallout chores ...
---
Me: Umm I’m just gonna go.. 
---
my friend: I apologize for the inconvenience but if you won’t join then you must conscripted against your will
---
If someone was to ever tell me that there's an even nicer gaming community than this one, I'd question their life choices that made them think such lies were acceptable.
---
Granted, but it stays up for too long and you can’t tell how close you are to cap limit because that purchase that maxed your caps in the 15 second slideshow hasn’t popped yet.
---
^a ^finger ^on ^the ^monkey’s ^paw ^slowly ^curls
---
Hello,This happens only with radaway ? Have you tried diluted version ?Since I have been running life giver perk (2/3) I have not died with my bloodied build by any of these bugs.( well fed / radaway )
---
This seems to work but the file gets deleted everytime you close the app for me
---
is it just a flat cap, so weapons that attack faster are better? or does fire rate play into the cap
---
I only use diluted radaway and it still happens. Life Giver might be the one saving you mate, not using it myself.
---
I have wanted and wished for the darn auto close slocum joe door since I made my first camp. I was so excited to see the slocum joe bundle and then almost cried when it did not include the door. Really? No darn door...of all the stuff they could have included...nope, not the door. God forbid they give players what they want lol.
---
That’s sick, I was going to look at doing an underground CAMP soon but I’m still fairly new so I’m just trying to build something above first lol
---
This is literally what I’ve been asking for.
---
He's right. You're friend is a liar, unless he reports you.
---
Ray Chase my man.
---
Nah, they just foward the ticket, and say "we can not adjust score". It happened with me last week, first time, I lost 1250 score. And after that, just before the weekly, one of them arrived early (the capture 5 workshop one), so I was able to do it twice... so I am now just 250 score short.
---
Nah no one knew it happened but me I just wanted the thought that I wouldn't be banned to be reinforced thank you
---
Been playing alot, full unyielding with int on every piece, Berry mentats, cranberry relish, Brain fungus soup, inspirational, full building team, herd mentality, popping lunch box and farm the entire time they're active.
---
Oh, is this why every time I visit him I automatically have what he needs? Wasn’t sure why.
---
Quick question (somewhat related), do you get all the steam achievements if you switch over from Bethesda to steam. In other words, Will it retrospectively give me steam achievements? 
---
Secondly, is there any reason I should go over to steam - quicker servers, more players, better overall experience
---
From what I have personally experienced first hand, many of the FO76 players are full-time "professional" call of duty players who think fallout is just like any other "typical" shooter. They don't grasp what exploration or open world actually means, and instead of wondering around and enjoying the full game they try to rush through every as fast possible and try to fight every player they come across their sights as it's some competition.
---
There was a situation couple days ago, when after killing SQB the whole crowd jumped to their public teams to farm the events. Nobody farm the nuke zone, so I decided to take it all by myself. And like couple steps from the SB corpses there was a Wendigo Colossus. I met it for the first time that day. I checked the map and nobody was there :DI hitted that bastard and run to the nearest tents so maybe somebody will return to their stuff. Running there like a dummy, until one guy to on his tent and saw this Benny Hill show. Then another one guy showed and we fought that thing in three. I even created the public team for legendary farm, but no one joined it:) everybody were on public events, that was pretty funny situation.
---
Well... I am use this jetpack. Looks cool. Ill earn it later anyway.
---
It would go really well with the Red Rocket set aswell. Such a shame. Bethesda gives way too much room for improvement on way too many things
---
I definitely noticed it in the last couple hours. Only downside is I’m basically solo-ing events now
---
Hold on! I'll go get my tinfoil hat!
---
Yeah, just make sure you never drop whatever item you have.
---
Umm it's quite easy to get the same weapon with the same rolls and them not be duped (by you).
---
Yea events are harder now, I joined a server and someone activated encrypted and no one went because their was only 3 high level player in the server including me.
---
Weapons workbench!
---
Not at the moment it’s not. A lot has changed the market over the past couple days
---
Where is it stored? I’m ‘misc’? I always clear out my junk etc.
---
I want to join! Ign is Balthazarthegreat3
---
I want a face palm emote. I've done some dumb things out there and know others players were left scratching their heads. Ha
---
I am just in the ideal rank... and I still have to do the dailies and I miss 1 weekly (3 NW one, it is 2/3... I skipped the 9 creature killing one... and I may skip the 6 stimpack one too...).
---
If they really cared about it then they would have shut down the vendors like they did with the ammo machines. They instantly disabled those suckers.
---
Mine works naked in my bar.
---
I found a Daguerre in the ash heap locked in a room of only windows wearing only that color and a sign on the wall that said glory hole 50 dolla. It made me very uncomfortable.
---
Yes this dupe glitch has been out before even wastelanders was released and it was keeped behind closed curtains to prevent people from taking advantage of this exploit.
---
Yup. I log in, do my dailies, excluding the NW one, then log out and go play Fallout 4. I'm hoping the Brotherhood content will reignite my enjoyment of Fallout 76. If not, I guess I'll just have to keep finding ways to keep Fallout 4 interesting.
---
I want this, too, something that you can toggle on and off to just highlight like legendary corpse or highlight everything. I had bloody mess on and it can be a nightmare trying to locate the parts. I notice sometimes meat piles combine into a heap but it doesn't seem to happen all the time and sometimes empty corpses just don't disappear and it's so confusing.
---
I have never heard of this event where is it located at so I can try it next time I'm on
---
Yea unsure to why people are glitching score when in a few days they can rank up with atoms ( if they where smart and saved all there earned atoms from playing normally ). At the rate at which they aquire score ( I'm already level 31 from regular playing ) but even so these are cosmetics not like the new gear wastelanders dropped which I saw tons of people rocking on day one which made more sense than this but I guess people will exploit any system that is already broken. Unfortunate people can't just play, I bet they will be the first to complain they are border because they have nothing to do or unlock 🤣.
---
No kidding. Sometimes bodies follow me all the way across the map when I fast travel. It's really weird when it happens, the body flies from out of view and into position it less than a second.
---
It will likely cease in a few days but all these people claiming bans are being rolled out are full of s***.
---
I love helping out lower levels. Just today I pooped out several stimpaks, Chems, a stealth boy and extra plans I had to a level 3 player. They kept avoiding me even with the heart, wave, and gift icons. It was almost like "if I take your crap will you leave me be!?" Ha. They gave me the heart emoji and fled after finally taking the stuff. (I say pooped because I always squat when I drop things and it looks like my character is poopin')
---
I loathe the Reputation Grind. Whoever set that grind up needs to have a cat shit in his or her shoes on a daily basis for the next nine years.
---
Ok thank you. I though it was a bit off. Because I know bloodied and junky are big right now
---
Exactly. Getting your INT up and having easily attainable multiple XP buffs is fairly trivial.
---
Ah damn. Can’t complain though, he’s an awesome voice actor too. Just thought Ward kinda sounded like McCree.
---
Worked perfectly for me. Well done, thank you!
---
The people that kept it hidden are the same people charging $300 for a Junkies explosive fixer hopefully this glitch being wide spread tanks the value of RMT
---
Let my girl play and she stumbled upon one and got a pie the first try! She then proceeded to use every single one she found after that and got 4 more... I still can’t get one though !
---
Is there ever going to be a fix for crime, or are they just going to keep penalising people who commit crimes 
---
🤔
---
Good job, finally this topic gets attention. We could use coloring for the legendary loot like in swtor. Or autoloot legendaries like in fasnach so disappearing loot will not make a huge impact.
---
It is a great game, but deeply buggy. When people stop complaining and posting here then BGS is in trouble. People complain because they do play it and want what's screwing up their immersion or game style to be fixed in a reasonable time frame. Once they stop complaining, they probably just stopped playing.
---
It doesn't increase stealth. Refer to Angry Turtle's stealth studies.
---
Isn't that reward, like, in the 60s range on the Score board? That is... An OBSCENE amount of grinding.
---
Honestly...its not that hard to level up at all considering whats going on.
---
4x events bonus? Thats 2500xp for a BOS daily?  Radiation rumble is an instant level up for anyone lvl 150 and below...
---
If youre in an events group the only excuse you have for not leveling up once is not running events
---
Hmmm. I thought it added stealth but doesn’t appear to because with the stealth perk your already maxed out with one piece.  So a full set u can remove stealth as a perk. I know with the full chameleon set I made I can remove stealth and run WS without coming out of caution.
---
That's the one. I've found 2 of those. One is in a display case and the other one has been in my inventory since I got it and I've never once had to actually do Ward's quest.
---
Woah, dang dude and I thought I was ahead haha
---
Dude you think you’re a dumbass.....hold my beer......I didn’t know about Photo Opp.....Photo Opp!!!!....until I was nearly done.  Thank you!!  Next!!!!
---
That's level 60...we are only on week 2...
---
This concept many ppl don't seem to understand
---
When I saw ground zero achievement I said piece of cake. "Warning nuke launching" I just fast traveled to the nuking area and waited for detonation - Nothing. So I got allied first with Settlers and Raiders :D
---
Level 50.  And yes, it was. Cry for me, dear friend.
---
All the NW ones are annoying other then the camp building/stimpak use/survive for x mins...those don't interrupt the flow of gameplay at all. The other ones do...since your hunting down creatures to kill or trying to get team mates to revive you.
---
Scrap them for delicious delicious lead 🤤
---
I live in a well shaded area of the mire. Finding anything in the grass is near impossible if you don't have a fixed reference point to guide you. The camera trick is your best bet right now.
---
Great, I’ll be hanging onto that one!
---
Scrap em for the lead. They weigh a lot and look like regular gold scrap in the display case. They're not needed for anything.
---
I have no clue guess time will tell
---
Noob here, but how does this work?
---
Awesome thanks guys
---
There are times when only tough love will do. Most don't criticise for kicks but to see improvements in something we care about.
---
Or at least the heads of the enemies we kill in the game.
---
Ok but the tree. THE TREE
---
These are the same type of people who complain when they've burned through the content.
---
This is an important message
---
I kept seeing my door open so I finally fucking locked it...ya'll musta been raised in a barn! Freaking animals.
---
Samuel is actually a Secret Service member from Vault 79, I think. Hell, he's the bullion broker for Foundation once you complete the story.
---
THERE IT IS
---
Sounds like you need to change where it is showing that you are (which server it is connecting you to for the VPN).
---
I love now that I’m foundation ally I can choose the “I had to kill everyone I hope it’s worth it” option and make that dumb sleepy bastard feel a little guilt over losing his auto-erotic sex toys every fucking day.
---
I never bother with challenges. I just make my own agenda and follow it for the session. I hate being forces to do anything in a game and usually just ignore the story until I want some thing that requires doing something story based.
---
I do a bit of grinding every night while watching streams and movies.  It's how I relax before bed.  
---
What can I say, I like a bit of mindless grind
---
Was it worth all the grinding?
---
Nah
---
Yeeeessss.that would be sweet!
---
depends what you mean by griefing. 9 out of 10 times it's your own fault for shooting back or taking a workshop.
---
10 is an exploit that I don't think Bethesda is ever going to ban anyone for.
---
HOW
---
DARE
---
YOU
---
Man some people are hard up.
---
More than just the past couple of days. Caps are worthless.
---
idk why youre downvoted...if thats their base SPECIAL...theyre lying
---
if its with perks/mutations its legit...but underwhelming
---
I just...can't even comprehend how you grinded that much XP.
---
I know at least one person in this post said they were raised in a barn 🤣🤣 i would lock my doors but my CAMP is a sort of show-off version of the overseers home
---
Won’t be fixed till Monday probably because of the weekend
---
I mean way out in the mire off the map they have some areas that are fully done and you can’t access them except when you glitch out of the map. They have workbenches and loot and everything.. Just a piece of the map they were working on then decided to scrap for whatever reason.
---
Easier than bows which yiunstikl have to luck to find and find the right one if you need a specific one like explosive  is to just run into the storm. That’s what I did. Takes a while to kill you and gives you plenty of time to use stimpacks. Enough so I got glitched and it wouldn’t let me use the hot button to use a stimoack and it took me a while to remember I can always go into my Pip-Boy. Got all 6 in one match.
---
Im guilty.bought lock,stock,and barrel.
---
Yeah i finally got my hands on a b2525 fixer for a REASONABLE price so if Bethesda have done this on purpose than praise them....
---
I always play in passive mode. I can't hurt other players and I'm not the type of player that would ever take a workshop from another player either. To me, to do that is just an ignorant thing to do to a fellow player.
---
Caps actually have a bit of value now. The dupe costs a lot of caps tbh. The B2525 is over 2k caps each time you dupe it. So Caps are definitely more valuable now than before.
---
The three preventative action hierarchy is this:  
---
1 - remove the ability to dupe  
---
2 - enforce harsh punishment for duping and heavily police it  
---
3 - spread *rumours* of harsh punishment and heavy policing.
---
The third and least effective measure can be carried out by groups of people within a dedicated community. The higher and *better* options must be done by the developers, but require professionalism and dedication to matters other than **their profits**.
---
The duping will only be fixed if they stand to lose customers and therefore *profit*.
---
Fed76 isn't worth the electric it takes to run the servers. Keep in mind, caps are worthless, and have been for well over a year. If you want a more accurate picture of what it's worth, check the game trading sites or even eBay. In so far as it's cap price? That's debatable. You might get 10-20k out of it. Tse miniguns aren't that rare, let's be honest, and the ones with things other than 250 damage resistance are often sought after more.
---
I absolutely do! I'm sitting at halfway through level 30; being 20 levels past that is simply impressive. Kudos for the effort!
---
Are you able to log into a low level character and level up through their havent tried it out-but thought of it
---
I think irrespective of game pass, wastelanders has attracted solo enthusiasts like myself. I wouldn't touch 76 previously, but loving it now. Be even better if your ally could accompany you once you've completed the related quests. But certainly not a show stopper. The 2020 road map looks like making it even better. Well done Bethesda, about time you listened.
---
I may be an ignorant thing to you but if you take over a workshop on a public server you should accept the possibility of PvP.
---
Word
---
hate that too. If i toggle the mission tracking off/on and choose to make "only this active" from the map it helps...
---
... sometimes...
---
Oh sweet! That worked. I was originally connecting to a server in LA and so I just switched it to Texas. Thanks!
---
Get a good route and make sure you have all the xp boosts up at all times.  I was getting 10k exp/100 score every few minutes.
---
I get bored just watching movies and doing nothing, so I grind while doing it.
---
Ah...well my house has a way you can get into it from the roof if anyone has a jetpack or mutation and really wants to check my place out...but that's only on my low level character...my other character who's my main...everything is locked up tight but there's all the benches outside so anyone passing can fix their stuff, get rid of their rads, grab some crops and free purified water if they want. It's a farm house styled camp...kinda basic but I tried to squeeze in a lot of detail in that build...really proud of it actually but I can't leave it unlocked since people are animals!
---
I'm always aware that workshops are up for grabs. Not complaining about that. This group came to my camp. To me that's not right. To avoid anything further I just logged off the server.
---
It's laughable that you think Bethesda even really cares that much about fallout 76 anymore. With their upcoming blockbuster releases, and the upcoming console releases, they have bigger fish to fry. And yes, this glitch has been around for ages. Just someone finally spilled the beans on it.
---
I will!!!
---
What about Mortimer at Crater though? And was Samuel in Foundation prior to unlocking bullion? I don't remember. The SS guys weren't even able to leave that vault prior to you getting there.
---
I’m a solo player to and I completely agree, I read soon in one the updates they’re will be areas that is speculated to either be bought or rewarded as a player home that you can replace you camp with. It’s call instanced camp so you enter a new cell, Linda like the wayward or foundation and crater buildings.
---
&gt; I may be wrong as I was told that griefers were gone now.
---
You got told wrong.
---
They ban dupers and hackers, not griefers.
---
According to a recent post about too much complaint the op said "game is excellent". He is   now going to proceed with Tandi's quests I guess.
---
Oh man please tell me you knew about west tek
---
Well, the bad guys always have it easier ingame/irl so I joined Crater
---
If you find one of the items Ward wants randomly on the ground in the world somewhere you can pick it up and his quest will complete automatically without removing the item from your inventory.
---
New members are always welcome all you have to do is switch your flair over to the mighty Enclave and show your true allegiance to the worthy rulers of Appalachia. After all we brought you nuclear weapons.
---
I tried everything nothing changes really, yesterday it randomly popped out on my map when I accidentally walked to the quest area, shit is pissing me off
---
I love the idea of a farmhouse CAMP. I have multiple characters with a CAMP relating to their role in society, my melee sheepsquatch character has a little 'cryptid hunter' type cabin in the mire, my BOS gal has a steel fort in the bog, and my main has the overseers home with all the little trinkets &amp; collectibles/atom items. Still yet to create &amp; decide on my fourth character though. 
---
If you're on XBOX and we ever team up I'll be sure to close every door behind me! xD
---
A bit raunchy but I agree with the sentiment.
---
Well ****. That sucks.Thanks for the info.
---
Let me rephrase. Was the grind worth it?
---
UF is the best event in the game.  Even bester if done solo and you can handle it.
---
Or you’re drunk on the monorail elevator and just took on 800lbs of weights...you’re not walking with that shit and you aint leaving that lead, so......drunk dial Microsoft shop for atoms and buy 15 scrap kits.   Aw yeah!!!!!
---
Nah, not with people able to buy 50k large handmade presents for under ten bucks.
---
My eyes are bleeding from the grind, but I'm going to assume you said something nice.
---
Thank you, friend!
---
Right, right, and how many bobbles did you burn through? 🤣
---
I wish i knew of you guys before i sold my legendary cultist blade :-p
---
Not a problem. It's a common problem when using fire sticks that have been hacked and using a VPN.
---
How come the helmet opens up randomly
---
I don't think the situation in Vault 79 was ever as dire as they led you to believe. I think they could get in and out, and sent feelers like Samuel and Smiley to get the idea into peoples' heads about starting a new economy. And if you look closely, Smiley looks a *lot* like Regs from the vault.
---
No one can have 50k presents man. Bethesda raised the weight on those awhile ago. If you had that much then you can’t trade or drop anything until you get under the max player weight. Perk cards and armor don’t affect the weight either. It was a smart move by Bethesda to counter the present dupes.
---
My main character had a rough life in the vault and just wants to live peacefully on their farm, helping others if they need it. Thus a farm house build with all the items outside to help players.
---
I'm on PC.
---
Why not do a building team? You’ll get bonus xp from the int boost for whatever you do that earns xp, not just a boost on xp for finishing events. It will probably earn you more even if the bonus is smaller if you are doing a lot of non event stuff.
---
Under what circumstances though?  Someone else killed the raider and didn’t grab it and the body disappears or ... ?
---
Are you PS4 because I saw the same thing! It reminded me of the ladies in paradise falls f03.
---
I'm afraid that there is no other option than to change your lifestyle as XP gain is a linear growth.
---
Every level needs 160 XP more than the previous one, the sole exception being level 1 to level 2, that's 200 XP.
---
160 XP doesn't sound like much, that's like 1 level 48 super mutant. Not hard, right? Wrong.
---
You are now level 140. You have, so far, accumulated a total of 1,562,360 XP. 
---
To get to level 1500 from there you'll need another 178,377,600 XP. No, that's not a typo. That's **178 MILLION 377 THOUSAND 600 XP**. 
---
Or in other words, level 1500 requires you to repeat **everything** you did up until this point for another **114** times. 
---
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?
---
They sure seemed like they were stuck in there but who knows. I'll have to stop by and see Smiley again. I've wondered about that guy, and his get up certainly seems gung ho patriotic, like something the SS might use as a disguise. I mean how many other people are draped in the US flag like that in the wasteland, let alone a perfectly clean one?
---
Wastelanders introduced a bug in which VATS in PVP would sometimes not do any damage. I'm guessing it never got fixed.
---
I don't PVP though so I could be wrong.
---
Unironically might be a cool idea. There's rumors that there's gonna be a community event for prepping the observatory for the brotherhood, there could totally be another one for building up 76 City.
---
Mules are a thing bro. And FYI, if you had millions of presents before the weight increase, they didn't just disappear.
---
It's so we feel like we're falling behind and spend Atoms to rank hop when it becomes available.
---
Maybe its meant for future content.  fractured steel is introducing expeditions. it could be a new area to send us too. Its possible they haven’t added in other assets to avoid early spoilers.
---
Fuck mothman, me and my homies hate mothman.

Most players in their mansions getting R&amp;R and going to see the playboy bunnies being flown in on choppers.   I don’t get much R&amp;R, I’m either dug in too deep in my one room crack shack or moving too fast.  My idea of R&amp;R is razor grain and some cold radroach meat.
---
Yeah I found them myself a while back, just a little environmental storytelling
---
I don't know for sure but I can say that if you don't have the quest and kill a raider thief yourself a quest item will not be dropped. Maybe it happens when the thief despawns without having been killed.
---
My only complaint about the game has been griefers coming to my camp and destroying everything or trying to.
---
Idk, but that's a thought. Check it out for yourself. If you look on the map, where the black and red meet for the mire and bog, there is a black and a white box at the edge of the map. I apparently crossed the border at the black square.
---
i would love a station of the "old" radio shows.
---
Where do you loop at?
---
So like someone else mentioned, they only spotted them in vendors. So I bought one and it started the quest. Didn't know that worked. Can't find them in the wild anymore.
---
Edit: you mentioned it.
---
I got 5 in Fo76 before reaching lvl50, so it definitely felt easy to get.
---
I know from experience. They didn’t disappear lol. But if you had a million then everything on that character was locked. You had only one option to destroy the stuff in your stash or on your person. You couldn’t trade or drop anything without destroying it. Now I know you don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
This is why I have two accounts.
---
It's *really* not the solution we need, though.
---
Had a hacked God mode a-hole in my camp yesterday. Kept harassing me and getting in my way hitting at me. Finally got sick of it and hit him with a bloodied gauntlet (about 2k damage). 3 hits and nothing. Then he proceeded to level my camp with an explosive gatling. Even my bloodied expl 50 machine gun did nothing. 
---
So yeah, they are still here.
---
Oh fuck i read it "refuse" my bad and metal wise was just a poor choice of words
---
I'm still hunting for the legendary Nuka Beer (79% alcohol) to get drunk for 3 nights in my camp after fighting robots and that freaking Asssssssaultron. Anyone seen it? I'm low level btw.
---
The 'Interior Cell' (or whatever it's called) is coming with the 'Fractured Steel' update this Winter. 
---
How i actually see it: It's going to likely be a 'Reputation' unlockable with the Brotherhood of Steel (Like how the Garden Planters are with the Settlers).
---
I'm thinking the 'Reputation' system will be based upon Brotherhood 'ranks': 
---
- Squire (Cautious) 
---
- Initiate (Cooperative)
---
- Knight/Scribe (Friendly) 
---
- Senior Knight (Neighborly) 
---
- Paladin (Ally)
---
Line two cases up as perfect as you can and make a blueprint. Dont forget to make note of the direction the items will face (theres a smudge stain on one side that can help)
---
Nope, I'm running a character with 40+ int and it still goes up with berry mentats.
---
Recently people have reported that on switching from NW back to Adventure mode, the boundary wall disappears.
---
Players always spawn at the front of the entrance to my base and the vendors are all there, easy to find.
---
Just launch a nuke you take care of leveling up, killing a legendary enemy, and doing 1 event. Not so much of a grind. So just launch a nuke you will feel better about the grind!
---
&gt;Yea unsure to why people are glitching score when in a few days they can rank up with atoms.
---
I do not defend them at all but not everyone wants to spend atoms on ranking up. For me personally it's either through normal play or nothing. My earned atoms are better spent on other things.
---
Sir, you just saved my day
---
Radicool is working for me afaik.
---
I've actually never used a bobblehead, I'm still trying to finish my set!  I know leadership gives you like a 5% exp boost or something but I can't find them reliably so I'd rather just spend the extra time grinding.
---
The most important exp buff is the 25% from Tasty Squirrel Stew for Carnivores or Cranberry Relish for Herbavores
---
My personal update on the winter jacket — OMG I just unlocked it!! It’s hilarious because I finally got it on the worst run ever. I only survived 10 minutes and was taken out by the first person who found me because I don’t know how to use the fucking bow and I didn’t have any armor. 😂 I guess all I needed was that 150 XP from a bad match.
---
Hang in there on getting your jacket! It did take me almost a week to grind for it tho :/
---
You speak the truth
---
It’s gonna be interesting to see how  it works people are thinking that’s what the locked buildings at white springs might turn into. I can’t wait to do bos stuff, it’s a good change from having to do enclave and I’m curious to see if they’ll add conflict between the two.
---

I’m so happy (and amused) right now.
---
This is the kind of stuff I love in this game! These are amazing, I get serious The Last of Us vibes from it. Damn fine job!
---
Thank you! Now to spend the next two and a half months just sitting in my camp staring at my TREE
---
Yep since people can still buy from unpowered machines, if you're close to cap and do not want to do anymore sales keep your machines in a  closed place with the garage door and no windows.
---
Either hide the switch to the garage door or delete the power line. This way you're not gonna miss on caps you can't receive.
---
Really? I only played 76 for one month and I found 3 just in that. And I think just one in F4. Anyways, let me tell you, they're not that delicious :p
---
Definitely continue on the main quests. Join a building public team. You don’t have to actually play with anyone in it and continue through the main quests. This public building team will give you +4 when it’s full to intelligence. The more intelligence you have the more xp you will get for each kill. Also wander around the forest area which is all the green area around vault 76. Morgantown airport will have a good amount of lower level enimies as well. Hope this helps.
---
If only Aries and Judy spawned more often. I just saw them for the first time today, and I missed half of the dialogue because I joined late.
---
Oh god. THE WORST. When i first started, i had spend hours and i mean hours on my camp. Then some guy came in and destroyed EVERYTHING. I didn’t know you could repair it but i had a good cry sesh over it lol before i realized. Still was pissed though.
---
Is there really a chance you can get one from the machine or is this a joke? Because I always interact with them if I see one.
---
Sure I don't, bro. Sure I don't.
---
I have a theory:
---
Being in an event team makes people who do events often more likely to join your team, and the game incentivizes them to do those events with extra xp. Because the game pretty much considers events to be times quests, if a teammate completes an event while you’re lazing about in your camp, you get a cut of the cash.
---
No yea I know the number will still go up but I’m wondering if you stop getting extra exp after 25 points of int because that is what someone told me.
---
Not anymore. They fixed that one.
---
Do you mean Nukashine?
---
The people who don’t respect a simple line bother me too. If there are multiple players waiting on one vendor, form a damn single-file line. Did elementary school teach us nothing? We’re Vault Dwellers, dammit, not a pick of savages!
---
Are you sure that rad rumble is an instant level up? I thought all xp for anything was capped to 4000
---
I meant the xp still goes up. Sorry, that wasn't too clear. Aside the usual buffs and food lunchboxes give 25% extra xp and stack up to 100%. Doing West Tek runs I get over 1000 xp per high level super mutant. That's where all those extra 100 score come from.
---
TSE minigun is good, use it to trade with other weapon instead of cap, fed76 is juz a reference
---
Amen, I have a list of maybe 100 players in the last week I've ran into in nuclear winter using scripts to farm instead of playing sucks get 3 afk jumpers as team mates.
---
Ah no, I use the teams thats not where the problem lays
---
Mainly for xp boosts I sleep, mama dulce meat stew, teams and the xp while in team level 3 perk card 
---
I know cranberry relish etc, but I dont have it 
---
This daily still takes way more effort than any other daily and is not a good daily in general,its cheap and tedious. And Im not saying this is what you think, but alot of people are very against the nuclear winter challenges but the level up one is fine? Id argue that some NW challenges have been way more fair than the level up one (not the survive for 30 mins, thats shit is stupid as fuck, same with kill 9 creatures)
---
I think that’s because pre-Wastelanders, there was sweet fuck all to do after completing the main story so I imagine a lot of people left the game there
---
Even post Wastelanders there’s sweet fuck all to do, we just earn SCORE now for doing it
---
Listen man. Not gonna argue. Maybe it’s diff on other systems or something but I had a lot of presents. When they changed the weight my “mule” (yeah I know) was extremely overweight. I couldn’t sell or transfer anything without the “you will destroy this item” warning. So I spent a long time destroying the gifts to get under the max player weight. So what is your thoughts on that
---
Actually up to 12 slots now
---
That’s why it tells me you really don’t know.
---
The only thing that I know of that works in vats is the railway rifle with a automatic piston
---
Yes to both please.
---
My int runs at 39 due to unyielding. I did notice a difference between 25 and 39, but not a HUGE difference.
---
saving my lunchboxes for the double experience event, im hype
---
hunting creature is about RNG n should be maximum of 3 in daily challenge, btw revive is ez, grab a friend and go to the ring of fire
---
50 is the level for the tree, and if you think that is bad, I finished the grind.  Made a post about it too.
---
supposedly the softcap is at 49 intellect from what ivce heard
---
Ahh haha all good. This is good to know I’m also wondering what perks if any you are using to boost your exp. I joint building teams and have egghead and strange in numbers but is there anything else I should consider. I was thinking maybe inspirational if no one else shares it.
---
There are 18 logs.
---
I don’t even want to do it with a level 70 character. I wanted to take my time and enjoy the game but now I find myself having to grab my Gatling laser and go kill a couple of SBQs while a nuclear plant just pumps out fusions cores for tomorrow
---
Nice try Todd, but we all know your game sucks balls
---
Nah, todays was extremely easier
---
Since Fallout 3, huh? [Interesting](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Port-A-Diner).
---
Okay that’s what I had also thought so I’m glad that someone else also heard that.
---
There are 18 holotapes. You are missing one.
---
Aside from the first one, "Overseer's Log - Vault 76" there are 17 more. Here's what I got from the wiki.
---
In probable chronological order, the holotapes are:
---
Overseer's log - C.A.M.P. - The Overseer's camp south of Vault 76 during the quest First Contact. This is changed to getting it from Duchess at The Wayward during Wayward Souls after the release of Wastelanders.  
---
Overseer's log - Flatwoods - In the church that serves as the Responders' command and trading post in Flatwoods, to the right of the entrance.  
---
Overseer's log - Morgantown - Near the Responders HQ terminal on the second floor of the Morgantown Airport terminal.  
---
Overseer's log - Firehouse - In the reception area of the Charleston Fire Department.  
---
Overseer's log - Top of the World - At Top of the World in front of the elevator doors.  
---
Overseer's log - Free States - Outside the door to Abbie's bunker.  
---
Overseer's log - Camp Venture - At Camp Venture, in the command center.  
---
Overseer's log - Allegheny - In Fort Defiance, close to the third floor elevator.  
---
Overseer's log - McClintock - At Camp McClintock, in the main building.  
---
Overseer's log - Charleston - In the Charleston Capitol Building, in the lobby of the DMV area.  
---
Overseer's log - Fort Defiance - In Fort Defiance, close to the fourth floor elevator.  
---
Overseer's log - Grafton - In Grafton, right next to the Grafton mayor.  
---
Overseer's log - Site Alpha - Close to the elevator which descends into Site Alpha.  
---
Overseer's log - Site Bravo - Close to the elevator which descends into Site Bravo.  
---
Overseer's log - Site Charlie - At R&amp;G Processing Services, near the Site Charlie elevator.  
---
Overseer's log - Nuke launch - Close to any of the previous three holotapes, after a player character on the server has nuked a target that isn't a fissure site.  
---
Overseer's log - Mountainside - The Mountainside Bed &amp; Breakfast, north of Site Charlie, at a makeshift table outside the building (this holotape is not part of a cache).
---
I haven't tried this since Patch 20, but before that after talking to the Overseer and "giving her the tapes" they were left in your inventory and became droppable/tradeable. Easy way to get 100 legendary scrip, 300 Caps, ammo, armor, and experience on an alt. Some guides say you need to launch a nuke to complete the quest, but i did it on a fresh character *just fine!*
---
Same here. Thanks to fellow redditor I was able to repair mine as well. Didn't know I could until they told me.
---
What exactly do u like about it so much
---
Assuming you have friends who play this game and NW...
---
People already complain about all the challenges lmao I can't imagine if they were actually difficult and took more than 5 minutes
---
I'm with ya though, I would enjoy a bit more difficulty
---
So, you have a shoot on sight order view of raiders... but them having the same on you... is wrong?
---
And the game firmly establishes the raiders as the West Virginia locals who fled the scorched, and that the foundation is outsiders moving in because the area has resources they want to exploit.
---
That's a trade secret, I'm afraid.  I play on public servers so I already have to fight everyone else for locations and mobs.  But also I like the idea of my personal loop being just for me.  
---
I pieced together my loop from a half dozen guides and youtube videos.  Just find out which areas are mob heavy and run them yourself a few times, get a feel for the area and where the mobs spawn.  Once you figure out an optimized path through them you can bang them out in about a minute per location.  Do your loop, server hop, repeat.
---
It helps to watch entertaining videos/movies while doing so.  Also do not obsess over efficiency.  Some of my locations aren't the absolute best exp wise but I enjoy running through them every time.
---
Same here mostly. I use a few for science, mostly because I noticed sometimes they don't work. I think if too many get used at once by not entirely sure the reason but it shows in your pipboy as having the buff but the reward per kill isn't extra.
---
Yuuup that’s why I’m trying to get everything perfect so I can just blast through the xp challenge
---
Cannibalism, lead belly, and bloody mess, they all make everything suck a whole lot less.
---
That's complete F****** bs. I hate those players.
---
Wait, that does not make much sense. If it is hard then it means that it has not gained satisfaction...... so would it truly be happy?
---
Can you mention your buff plz?
---
My thoughts? I watched with my own eyes 52k presents being taken out of a stash box and dropped for some one 15k at a time THIS VERY NIGHT.
---
Inspirational gives extra xp up to 15%.
---
Okay awesome thanks for the help!
---
Yeah my friends and I keep getting that and being super confused on why they were kicked
---
Are you on pc then
---
That is a bargain....I hope he hasn't sold it already
---
I got Fallout 1st on July 1st, I cancelled Fallout 1st on July 2nd.
---
I couldn't find value in the private server, scrap box is nice but a subscription should be required for that. I'll play the game stoned, but nothing about Fallout 1st has improved the game in a way that I felt good about subscribing for, and I've been paying Discord $5/mo since August.
---
Maybe they should drop price.
---
Just wait until you go after the achievements of using bobbleheads. You'll need 96 of them.
---
Because that’s impossible on consol
---
That's an odd looking silencer
---
No. It occurred on xbone.
---
I'm rank 32 and I have been getting at least 2 levels a day for the past few days. I am a bit concerned that'll happen soon though.  
---
You do have to factor in the weeklies and double XP and double SCORE weekends as well.
---
or down a fissure site
---
Cosmetics are content now?
---
Apparently it isn't. Would love to know how they did it, because it literally took that person 4 mules to hold all the presents.
---
Thank you all for the help. Hope I can pull something good during the sale at the purveyor
---
SHHHH don’t tell Todd!!!!!
---
The only thing it saved me was time because i would have been leveling up, I want to get to level 100 to get the rest of the cosmetics
---
52k would put them at 5,200lbs. Which is over the max weight. Just from my experience that’s not possible
---
 No. The Silver Shroud radio came along 170 years after the events of 76. The guy who made it hasn’t even been born yet.
---
Took me a while to level up, at least I can count on that for a challenge/grind.
---
Yeah, I'm not saying it should be like the ridiculous stuff (explore for 7600 hours and get a whopping 20 atoms!!!) But I would prefer something like "gain x amount of y crafting material." Like say 250 wood. Wood is easy to come by so getting 250 is not to hard but at least then I have to actually look for a specific thing rather than "use photo mode 0/1"
---
This comment actually sums it up very nicely, with every point about enviromental hazards included
---
Whitesprings, but it is the plot of Get Out.
---
My solution exactly
---
Ok that’s a different story. Four mules could hold those presents but sorry for the chap that took them all on one character
---
never heard of an xp cap.
---
i watch my score before and after i go into any event with mobs. Ive leveled up that way and with reg xp (canned meatstew/lovers embrace/INT team) 
---
Im level 300+...if i can level up in the one or two hours i have daily...most of yall should have no problem
---
Yes and I agree it would. Unless they glitched their inventory (the stash inventory). I do know there are still a few people running around with that glitch active.
---
Dude the enemies in this game are dumb af and aren’t getting inside ur house as long as u have any turrets outside
---
Yeah but that glitch still has issues dropping and trading stuff
---
True but again for a noob it takes so little xp to level up. I took a level 2 character. Went to the whitespring and wiped the place, walked out level 7.
---
I think you misunderstood me at some point. The person who received them took them on to 4 mules. The one who gave them to home, however, pulled them all from a single stash box without swapping chars.
---
That was patched out on June 30th. Scorchbeasts should always leave a body now.
---
Make imgur post. Make it hidden.
---
[Words you wanna type out]-(link to image/ videos)
---
Remove that dash and you're golden.
---
I would also enjoy things like "Launch a Nuke" "Kill a(n) insert difficult enemy" "Start Encryptid" whatever, even if it was only one difficult one per day to let the people who can't/don't want to do it rank up I'd be happy
---
I like when they did weekly 10k xp and instantly forget this and made get a level for daily. Its easier to make 10k xp then a level up for higher levels (I have 5 100+).
---
So it could have been 1k xp for daily its ok for almost any level.
---
What I do not get from these new challenges. Why did not they test them for time expense. A daily quest should be around 10-20 mins a weekly 1-2h.
---
You're correct, and i do have turrets. But, turrets can be dumb, too. Sometimes i genuinely find that mutant mutts manage to open my freaking doors and get inside. DOGS DON'T HAVE HANDS, BETHESDA
---
20
---
Too easy and people complain, too hard and people complain. Literally can't win.
---
That I wouldn't know about. I never wanted to try the stasj box glitches before tonight for fear of losing my really important stuff.
---
I do now. I just don’t see how that is possible. Everyone I know that had mass gifts had to destroy them until they were at around 1700lbs.
---
I have no clue what you’re saying 😐
---
I always loot before they explode because the body disappears almost every time.
---
Reminds me of when I played on actual GTA RP servers and all people did was grind money on there and just played themselves as a cop, or themselves as a criminal, you know no actual story or goals based on that character.
---
Seems like the same deal here. I'm not sure every ones obsession with finishing the season pass its not like you pay for it.
---
oh, gold bars weighed down with lead...
---
... looks like someone made "fake" gold bars to sell.... 
---
(looks suspiciously at Smiley)
---
I have a level 256 friend who still has yet to launch a nuke. Apparently it's not easy. You gotta get all the codes, get a key card, wipe out all the security, decode the code, then launch the nuke. Seems pretty forward but idk I'm not a nuke person.
---
I appreciate the suggestion, although it is enough of a time commitment to keep up with all of the other challenges, and I'm not sure that I can play every single day for the entire duration, so any bonus points would be needed just for me to keep up. I haven't tried to do the math, but it is looking more and more likely that I will not complete the run due to NW challenges becoming insurmountable.
---
Dunno. This is Bethesda we are talking about. I've been shown screenshots of inventories holding millions of presents. All I could do was shake my head at it.
---
Any weapon I get from her if I dont like it I just get rid of it for scrips.  I keep hoping I get a Junkie Fixer from her.
---
I did the stash box glitch once but never got it over 1700 so maybe that’s it. I feel bad for the guy who took 52000 gifts. He’s gonna be dropping a lot of gifts in the near future as his mules won’t be able to carry anything else
---
This is the part where Bethesda stabs us in the back
---
Also the people with 3000 hours on record who leave negative reviews on steam.
---
"Game got old, same old thing over and over, boring game"
---
So boring they put 3000 hours into it and then wonder why it got boring or felt like the same thing.
---
Yeah, 368-369 takes a little longer, lol.  I have a low level to use if I need to knock out the daily.
---
(assign raider punk to it)...
---
"Quiet day on the radio...."
---
Can easily win. Split the difference with intermittent.
---
 I grab those 2 materials because I need them to craft thorn armor pieces. That's why.
---
They can show screenshots but the stuff is useless after you hit max weight. I can promise.
---
Thanks I will do that next time. I was bummed I lost out on that loot. I think it was a 3* Sentry too.
---
Shame we can't have horses or some other wasteland beast to ride since running everywhere kind of sucks with the AP thing and all.
---
Good conversation though. Thanks for being chill
---
True. Or have a ton of various mules lol
---
I think it is worth discussing that alternatives like a pipboy radio tracker with on screen signal meter could be added to help those with hearing disability.
---
The code is already in the game for the Vital Equipment quests as well as others,, and it would be a minor thing for Bethesda to add that if the community could help bring attention to such ideas.
---
368?!?!? What have you done to get there? The highest I have ever saw is 274!
---
This guy probably Hates is right now lol
---
(opens stash, has two tin foil hats)
---
"no...."
---
(Looks toward horizon... tinfoil hats duped across appalachia) 
---
"Noooooooooooo!"
---
replace SCORE challenges with tadpole challenges
---
the mannequins are sentient, possibly synth spies, best to not give them power armor...
---
I keep her at my camp on Seneca rocks wearing nothing but her underwear and a bunny costume helmet
---
Oh I have no problem leveling up, but the max xp i’ve ever gotten was from Scorched earth and it was 4000 exactly so I think that’s as much as you can get for one thing
---
I was feeling this way in the wasteland, much more when I came to the necessary plans for the SS armor. Now, my current defeat is intriguing to see if it is possible to reach level 100 without using my atoms, probably that first legendary race will be the only one that reaches 100. But i like to run xp, for repeatable, after i finish with dealy chalingens, my only problem is the obligation to play NW, really hate that mode.
---
Sleeping buff for 5%
---
Tasty Squirrel Stew for Carnivores for 25%
---
or
---
Cranberry Relish for Herbavores for 25%
---
The perks Strange in Numbers, Inspiration
---
Lots of mutations
---
Groups, always groups
---
There are exp guides and videos, they all basically explain everything you can do
---
(finds burnt awesome tales comicbook)
---
maybe...
---
Why was your post locked?
---
No problem. Miscommunications happen sometimes.
---
Okay I like grinding but GODDAMN
---
A PA helmet mod would do the trick.
---
The problem is that the NW challenges are ballooning the required time commitment every day. It may have started out that the NW challenge took 5 or 10 minutes, but now it may take hours a day. I can't commit to three or more hours a day forever, knowing that by the end of this it could take 6 hours to complete the NW challenge.
---
I do hope that Bethesda could come up with a system that allows those who prefer NW to do challenges there, but offer an alternative in the main game. It could say, "use 6 stimpacks in NW, OR find 6 stimpacks in Adventure mode".
---
I'm not sure it would piss anyone off to have a choice.
---
It's 10%, 15% and 20%, its working normally
---
Played since the start.  I know one guy over 1k, and a few others way higher than me.  Level doesn't really matter, it's more about the build.  They farmed XP like crazy but I know all the plans, ect.  IT's all about how you spend your time in the game.
---
I found so many Bulk Springs today - kind of glad some of the score takes you out of Ur comfort zone.
---
Yeah if you do all that it can be difficult, but all you really need is the card, nukacrypt.com posts the codes each week
---
I'm a stealth build so I just kind of wander through, the most annoying part for me was destroying the control panels, but I recently discovered that grenades wipe out a giant swath of them instead of having to disable them one by one
---
I decoded my first few launch codes myself but it gets old eventually lmao
---
10% for rank one replaced with 15% for rank two
---
Oh fyi... Cranberry relish works for carnivore too
---
Nah man, I built Beckett a personalized bar in my camp.  He makes my camp fancy and doesn't annoy me with his voice lines.
---
Wat? Why?
---
This is why I treasure my BE gat plas
---
just want to kill for one? maybe super mutants at Grafton Dam or Grafton itself
---
NW shouldn’t be forced, but they want their shareholders to see numbers in NW.
---
So people just have 1 of their team die and they can just spam the other team with enemies ...?
---
43+15%=49,45
---
WHAT
---
Yes! I have had this very thought, particularly with the Scorched/Feral ghoul Officers. I once attempted to track one down and just gave up. As I said, I’m Hearing but I do play on console in my apartment so the audio isn’t great enough for me to distinguish well where those damn officers are. The on-screen signal meter would be so helpful for that, as well as in other places where it may help Deaf people. 
---
I’ll look into submitting a suggestion ticket. Beth does listen when we complain enough ... they’re fixing the ammo converter, so that’s encouraging, hopefully we can get more QOL improvements.
---
I am a stealth and bow build. CSA FTW
---
What you don't consider a plain black combat shotgun skin as content? someone had to work very hard with a desaturate and darken filter on that! I'll be you don't even think the red spray painted super sledge as that cool either... they had to break some fingers pressing ctrl C and ctrl V on the green one and slide that heavy hue slider all the way over from green to red! /sheesh.
---
Only projectiles can be vats in pvp. Though if my opponent pulls out an explosive laser or gatlin plasma. There is no point.
---
I've done it a good 60 or 70 times at this point, and on one of my recent runs I had someone else join as soon as I started it that grabbed all 4 crates before we even made it past the first checkpoint. Totally threw off my rhythm and I just felt weird for the rest of the event, like, "I'm supposed to be searching for crates right now... but there's nothing to search for..." I felt like a robot with a programming error.
---
For reference, I start the dialogue, immediately grab the first crate while they're still talking, play normally until clearing out the captain, then find the remaining 3. I know all the spawnpoints by heart now. Gotten everything twice except the gas mask, which I've never gotten as a drop, but another player was nice enough to give me one to complete my set.
---
OHHH PERCENT. Haha didn’t see that.
---
Not sure why you'd praise Skyrim which had actual full length novels written in it and say you're not here to read books? Kind of ironic.
---
Simply beautiful
---
Bruh...I will be launching nuke soon...I have the power! Chinese stealth armor, activate!!
---
I appreciate the kind offer. This whole issue has gotten me filled with feelings of frustration regarding NW and my own inability to keep up with other players. At this point I'm not sure if I will just stop even trying the NW challenges completely and hope for the best with regard to the math.
---
In any case, the point of my post here was not just to be able to complete the challenge myself, but that I have to believe that I am not the only player facing this problem, and I had hoped to bring it to Bethesda's attention.
---
I can understand that Bethesda may be desperate to try and get a piece of the Fortnight/PUBG pie using NW, but NW is not why I or anyone else bought Fallout 76 at release, and in my opinion it should be treated as a bonus and not mandatory.
---
I snagged an Unyielding Sturdy Metal Left Leg today during Project Purity, +1 intelligence &amp; water breathing. I don't run bloodied so I tossed it in my vendor for 450 caps. Might seem low but in my experience, nobody ever wants to pay much for armor that doesn't reduce something's weight. Then again, 4 of my 5 pieces are weight reducers, so I'm not judging.
---
You want to know the secret?
---
All the grinding in this game is designed to make it so the game is played much more than the content it actually has could ever provide. The Devs are probably under (HEAVY) pressure by the purse holders higher up, and by showing them that people are playing the game a lot, they keep their jobs.
---
This game isn't made by the core Bethesda Boys; it's a side group trying their best with what they've got. And so long as the Devs can keep the game afloat until the next Major Bethesda-created title launches, they'll keep earning money.
---
You might be in a tough spot, there is a double score event coming though so hopefully that will boost us all, I dont know when that is though
---
Very well
---
Folks did the numbers, I think you need to hit atleast 80 to be able to payout to finish the season. Might be misremembering but you can only buy 20 levels
---
I made house because I enjoy building in fallout and to be honest it's all I've really done in 76 since my return.  Setting an area aside for shops doesnt have to look bad or confuse your customers.
---
Diddly fucking squat.
---
I do not always even find a box before I am killed by other players, so it is not easy for me. I am frequently killed while unarmed and have to wait to try another match where the outcome can be the same.
---
Also, I have only ever run across one english speaking player with a microphone while playing NW, so communication is not easy either.
---
Hopefully but I’m probably gonna have to spend some $ to get that Cosmos power armor
---
Oh god if that’s true then I’m screwed
---
Yep just use a suppressor and aim for the weak points and you should be fine :)
---
It actually spawns more robots the more people are in the silo, so I find it easier solo or with one teammate
---
Is getting allied with them hard?
---
Yeah. do they have that? I have only gotten Nuka Quantum, Nuke Cherry and the Nuka Cola.
---
Yeah I think alot of us are tbh, you get 500 for winning the race though 🙃
---
Word has it, any over 4 bugs them out.
---
Don't need one. I'm a bow build. My bow does hella damage because I have the compound version. Max raider rep was worth it!
---
They could easily implement this thru new mentats recipes.
---
Cherry mentats-
---
would highlight corpses and meat piles in an area for 10 minutes. The bog is a nightmare for finding corpses. 
---
Id love to also see maybe
---
Lime mentats- 
---
to highlight pickable plants in an area. Good for hunting flux or certain hard to find crops
---
Blueberry mentats-
---
Would highlight ore nodes. This would be helpful in mines and the ash heap when trying to track down nodes amongst all the soot and darkness.
---
You'll level up pretty quickly in the beginning. I dont play as much as other but I hit 15 in the first week, currently I'm 35.
---
Explosive rifles work faster
---
I think that is exactly correct. If they want to get people to play NW, this could be incentivized in better ways, as I'm not sure the majority of players are going to stick with the Legendary Run anyway.
---
That’s a Mediocre award but after all it’s Bethesda I thought they love money
---
I think the issue is adhesive. You can get tato and mutfruit in the West Tek, then find some corns at any farm in the toxic valley. Those are all you need to create vegetable starch, you could get 2 adhesives from 1 vegetable starch. 
---
Remember to use the right perk.
---
That's what I figured was the issue.
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Nji1wR3q5hoHOKwKQWnK5p1qhtub7O64XPGZxeimpI/edit#gid=0
---
If you're not level 30 at some point today, you're behind.
---
You thought right mr. Man
---
Idk I found that I still had to aim directly at almost every one of the modules, but always good to have extra options :) maybe it's started working properly since I tried it
---
I know I’m not. The one thing I want is waaaayyyyy too far in. I don’t even know if I’ll use secret service armor. I get as much carry weight from my deep pocket assassin sentinel set as my Unyielding Secret Service set. If they add deep pockets to the limbs I’ll go back to it.
---
There's a side quest where you learn to brew Nukashine in Morgantown. After that the same NPC has a daily quest that often gives a bottle as a reward.
---
I live in the waterfall at the mire
---
Ah well I’m VERY behind then
---
They are perfectly tankable in pvp without aid items. get good
---
Even better :) I just started a bow build a while ago lol, only Lvl 12 so far but I got a nice compound bow from the purveyor yesterday on my main for when I level it up
---
Well I guess there are other seasons to do after this one so I just hope that there good
---
It's a joke and you obviously didn't get it.
---
That's not true
---
Down for me as well on xbox
---
what is duping? Sorry im noob but I was wondering what it is since I read it everywhere on Reddit ultimately
---
Sorry I guess I edited that out. I have developed a neurological tremor that causes my head and hands to shake, so aiming at moving and jumping players is pretty much impossible. I'm also middle aged.
---
In the regular game I use weapons like a Gatling Laser or Gatling Plasma up close, or VATS with aimed weapons. These haven't been options in NW.
---
Really though, the point was not for other players to help me. The point was hoping Bethesda might recognize that PvP may simply not appeal to disabled, old, slow, or otherwise disadvantaged players.
---
eh im past that point and its not too bad, 10k xp goes by faster then you think if you grind xp smart.
---
is that 1 of the Overseer quest where i had to deliver to the Foundation and the Crater people?
---
You win the thread :D
---
Yes allying with Foundation is immensely hard on account of the fact that you have to put up with the (formerly narcoleptic) Ward.
---
Oh fuck
---
Don't cry my dude. Just get good BE legacies are tankable very ez and i play pvp 24/7
---
Nah, they even not banning hackers. Like there are many in PC NW mode.
---
If you picked up or were given a quest item of his while you didn't have the quest active, it will autocomplete every time and the item will never leave your inventory.
---
Duping means they make 2 or more items from the same item via a glitch. Like they make copies from B2525 Fixers.
---
the system is literately built in such a way that only xp exploiters can make full use of it. clearly an endorsement from bethesda.
---
they dont give a shit about peoples time so why should anyone else.
---
it should take 1000 levels account wide to unlock everything. thats still a HUGE amount of playtime for anyone. 1500 per character is pointless, noone who doesnt cheat will ever make use of that systems potential.
---
Nope it's not related to the Wastelanders storyline. It starts in the frat house in Morgantown.
---
Yeah, before patch 20 fixed Shadowed mode for all armor it only worked on leather. I’ve been using a full set of heavy shadowed leather armor for many months, no chameleon and I’m invisible. You could add one chameleon piece for the visual effect but by comparing the width of the Hidden brackets on the HUD, I don’t think you get any increased stealthiness.
---
It irks the hell out of me that they didn't use the same colour.
---
thank you man
---
I took inspiration from the Postal Dude. Puts the balance of the weapon off a little though.
---
Yea lvl 30 go kill a SB with your fist
---
In the junkyard of nuka world in Fo4 there is a pie machine that gives you the pie allways on the first try.
---
Ok. That’s a mod. Chameleon adds sneak points. I run full unyielding with max agility. No HTD pieces and the sneak perks. I’m invisible. On my alt I can run full chameleon with no sneak perks on 2 pieces with sneak and I’m invisible. It stacks
---
Worked for me too. Thanks [Boldfacedsparky](https://www.reddit.com/user/Boldfacedsparky/).
---
Can you get legendary bows??? If so I need it!!
---
I noticed this too. Only time I heard it was after returning to adventure mode from Nuclear Winter mode. If I quit out and exited the game completely, after restart it was fine.
---
You guys look more like the band Ghost. I'd still join though.
---
Those poor bastards. Bethesda bout to fuck them good with no vaseline.
---
Oh my Im 27 I think
---
Whoever went through and downvoted all of OP’s comments kinda sucks... like he isnt bragging about it or anything. He’s openly giving people tips on buffs and stuff, tho he isn’t giving his loop which is completely fine
---
SHHHHHHH.
---
There is no such bug! Was never, will never be.
---
Oh, looked through my inventory and found a 'Portable Power Pack' there so that explains it. Thanks for the help!
---
Via technicality I did this. I bow and arrow it, it landed. Final 3 blows was with my fist. Technically killing it with my fist.
---
Is there a reason why he did it to u? I mean beyond of being just rude.
---
cant agree more ...
---
Iirc this worked the following way: if you have cards of each rank of the same perk, then all incoming duplicates of this perk just disappear on acquisition.
---
This is especially problematic with one star perks, they disappeared all the time beyond acquisition of the first one.
---
The ol collector curse, I feel you.
---
Also worth noticeable that there is challenge in World/Community section (i don't remember) "Collect Overseer's holotapes", so you can track what exactly holotape is missing
---
This needs to be higher so many bullshit in comments
---
here is one of your first answer:  
---
 "Anyone can do this with no bugs, exploits or glitches "  
---
Let say you are right, how do you do then?
---
Indeed you can :P legendary compound bows only drop from the purveyor
---
Legendary normal bows might be the same but I'm not sure
---
lol, and people are downvoting me for bringing up something that can be exploited
---
Better than what we used to have. Killing 5 deathclaws with a boxing glove, or something stupid like that.
---
Yeah... I have to choose to ignore that lol
---
1 star 2 star or 3 star?
---
no u

Iconic
---
Yeah any number of stars can drop, mine is Junkie's +10% Dwa +250 Drwr
---
Mine are outside right next to the fast travel spot. And if that isn't enough of a hint there's also neon signs and a street lamp.
---
Yes, I totally understand you and agree; your point is very valid. 
---
If you need help just let me know, I think is possible to help with this challenges because I can like look for the animals and with the stimpacks the same, I can go and drop them for you for example. If you are not on Pc a lot of people will help you too I think. And also the 250 points its luckily not too much. But I understand your frustation.
---
Somebody post the name of the developers here please
---
Nice one, especially sucks for them because now if you enter pvp with one person on a team, yoi no longer engage with the full team
---
I like boxing with Megan! She was my favorite death claw to beat with a boxing glove!
---
your already made this post before.
---
Well then I guess I am clueless as well
---
*0+0*
---
dupe when public thursday, bethesda had a chance to address it before the weekend but chose not too.
---
Not always, sometimes it's just early in the morning and it makes it harder to pee
---
Not always true. I got kicked from 2 teams in one night got fed up and made my own GD team. What is it with the team snobs?
---
because thats our job
---
"a bit of grinding before bed"
---
I'm happy with challenges as they are. Otherwise people become tourists and leave teams midgame
---
Keep happening to me every time I collect wood from logs, wtf?
---
Also there was one, use 6 stim packs. That was just stupid
---
It's good, enjoy it!!
---
Thank you! I appreciate it  
---
I wasn't going to bother saying anything because I figure it's just reddit being reddit, but it's still kind of a bummer.  Like I just wanted to share this moment that I'm proud of, the ONLY thing I want out of this entire season is this MAGNIFICENT TREE and I achieved it and I love it and I wanted to shout out my happiness from the mountaintops.
---
But yeah, reddit gonna reddit
---
Nope. Its uncapped.
---
Kent is a ghoul tho, he could be alive rn just ghoulish. Plenty of the ghouls were alive pre-war.
---
Yeah, I'm getting pretty tired of this insta-crash at this location.
---
Seems he wanted to browse that specific vendor, he didn't say anything just walked up to the vendor, started to melee me until I left the vendor then immediately started browsing it (unsuccessfully lol)
---
I got that way, now I’m back to playing fallout 4 because I hate dealing with deadlines and people.
---
I'd say someone is about to Get In.
---
The game crashed when I fast traveled the to rusty pick, on PC, and now when I try to spawn into the game it instantly crashes on loading in.
---
But what if they have the Karma Farma perk card?
---
Going to be cool when we unlock all the armor skins and don't have to use the outfit :)
---
Thanks. that was quite a chore to turn in all the claimtickets i had wasting away in my  inventory XD
---
Got the fancy shotgun and the wild-west-outfit in both variants
---
You still got milk breath. Come back here when you've crafted your 150th, untradeable SS piece that isn't even remotely close to complimenting your build. Or maybe you like playing for 3 months and making absolutely zero progress towards gearing up with the new shinies.
---
I don't blame those who do tbh but I miss the sense of satisfaction from doing it so I'd rather fix it personally
---
Sadly, it's probably a coincidence. I used to write up massive lists and send them over after testing things in depth, taking hours of my time just seeing how broken things are instead of playing the game, and to this day not even half of those have been addressed
---
If nobody has ever speaked it would be a fucking shit. But a huge amazing fucking shit.
---
Under display, you can disable the popups.
---
Why not just dupe the ammo then? Seems rather counterintuitive, if you're going to be cheating then at least do it properly smh
---
Ahhhh.. i see.... there are tons of quests in FO76 and just finish that Vault breaking main quest and find that quest frustrating especially that close quarter combat with the 2nd last Assaultron. Died there many times and tired of it. hurhur.
---
Level 96... mistress of mystery is the only one i have completed 😂
---
Hey thank you so much for the speedy reply! Can't believe I didn't see it haha, have a good night &lt;3
---
I think it’s just people being jealous tbh, but like that negativity is completely unwarranted while it’s still where you have to work for the rewards and not buy them. And it is a nice tree, I feel like it is meant for camps out in the toxic valley which is slightly disappointing that they didn’t add variants to it
---
I know what you mean. Had a nice experience with a camp under the ground texture. So wasted like 30 mins just to find the way inside -_-
---
If only there was a way to avoid speaking to Ward at all.....
---
Yeah, I've been having this happen lately.  I've disabled a bunch of mods that I have been using for months and it still crashes.  Last time this happened a week ago I just joined a private server and it was fine.  Now, it happened on a private server and I'm too tired to screw with it any more.
---
Lol that's great
---
That's a possibility as well because indeed if you respecced you are losing out on a lot of points. Happy cakeday btw!
---
Yes you're going to have to give Godd Howard your atoms.
---
You’re right. You do sound burnt out. Shhh go to sleep now.
---
Their basically the same as the old Atom daily and weekl challenges
---
Hmm. Why Radaway kills you on low health? I didn't know that. Is it deal some tiny damage to you or what?
---
I've got a Slocum's Joe Cafe.
---
Funny thing, I decided to platinum Fallout 76 before wastelanders dropped and the only trophy I didn’t have after like 1200 hours was be at ground zero of a nuclear blast. So to get my final trophy in 76 I ran a silo solo, dropped it on whitesprings, and just stood in front of the building and screamed “Beam me up Scotty!!” all while Metal County Roads by Leo Moracchioli blasted in the background. 
---
It was glorious... and a fitting end to such an awesome game.
---
I find this sub to be polarising. Haters or lovers of the game. Surely the truth for the majority of us has to lie between the two? And that view is not static, some days can be more frustrating than others.
---
If people really hated the game, to the extent the “Lovers” claim, then surely they would just stop playing, much less take the time to post on this site. &amp; as for the “Lovers” I can’t believe that anyone does not get frustrated with the combination of  bugs, Server performance, daily grind at some point.
---
My biggest grievance on this Sub is the use of the term “Circle jerk”. What you are saying her is, “lots of people agree with something, to which I disagree, they can’t be correct, I can’t be incorrect, I’ll just dismiss their view with an explanation of mutual masturbation”. It’s sad, and both polarised camps accuse the other of it.
---
We throw around hyperbole in an attempt to attract fake internet points, rather than have honest &amp; frank discussion.
---
This will be nice since I'm still stuck on 26 even after completing the dailies. It's been two days 😭, I did the weeklies and the 10k xp thing.
---
Being high level isn't a disadvantage for the score challenge as you have to earn the additional xp to level up....
---
~59,000 xp (roughly how much it is at level 368) is 5+ 100 score challenges a day....so level up gives them 750 score really
---
Same just to catch up to a reasonable rank. Mfers are at 30-42 rn
---
Nope NoRespawns did the math correctly, you can finish the thing in under 10 weeks and like 3 days.
---
whatcha gona doooo, whatcha gona do when they come for youuuu
---
😭
---
Gratz on 100!
---
It's Yaoooooooooooooooo Ceeeena
---
Oh man, I would LOVE different variants.  Just slightly different colored trees would be great
---
I love Riding Shotgun, run it every time it's available. wish we could get Aries as a companion, he's probably my favorite NPC in the entire game
---
Other players cannot destroy your camp so you are free to come and go as you please also for your items the only thing you lose upon death is whatever junk you are carrying, items such as weapons, armor stimpacks as well as food and water remain safe in your inventory. When you have your camp placed build a stash box to store whatever items or safe keeping or for later use be wary as the stash box has a 800 pound limit that's also where you wanna keep your building materials aka junk items inside there so you don't lose em when you die just remember to go up to a crafting table hit the scrap button and scrap all your junk to convert them into loose materials for building and making repairs to weapons as well as crafting new ones
---
True, but settlement have the gauss shotgun. I love that thing.
---
Just spill the beans on the exp exploit. Fucking cheater.
---
They can't steal your items (not counting the very rare glitch) any item put in your stash box is safe. 
---
As for of your camp can be destroyed, yes. Thought it's a lengthy time to my understanding and is technically an exploit, while repair is simply two buttons as long as you have all the needed items. And if someone is bugging you and repeatedly destroying your camp, you can switch servers to easily lose them.
---
Maybe if we can get a community uproar over it (even tho it’s done) we can get them to patch over some variants like how they are fixing the ammo converter. It’d be dumb and maybe they’d accidentally bleach all the trees but if we can bully Bethesda into patching something it would still be funny
---
If you into pvp - your base can be destroyed if you engage in pvp. If you don’t like it, switch to pacifist mode nobody can trigger you and touch your base.
---
As for items you have limited stash accessed only by you.
---
Nobody can destroy your base or take your stuff. There are only two times you can lose your stuff.
---
The first is if you are killed by an enemy. You will drop your junk and anybody can pick up the bag. If you get back to the bag first, you can take it all again.
---
The second is during PVP. Again, you can drop your junk and the bag can be taken. However, you can't enter PVP randomly. You would need to attack back for the PVP flag to be triggered. You can't just be gunned down while you are minding your own business.
---
Every so often, return to your C.A.M.P. and deposit your junk. Once it is there, it is safe and you don't have to worry about losing it. You only ever lose the junk you drop.
---
Is that for today? I had one where it was use 3 stimpaks.
---
At the same time not all of them are, and the further in time you go the less likely you are to get a ghoul that survived 210 years.
---
Lol this.
---
Hey bud , welcome and enjoy. No player can destroy you items unless you enter PVP . In game enemies can damage you items and your camp,  scorched , mutants and the likes so check out the spot before you build. Part of the game you have a stash box , no one can access whats in there. You can store and its safe .
---
That seems clear enough. With no other buffs, and only one prefix, we are talking: Anti-Armour first, and players choice between Two Shot and Explosive.
---
There's an item in misc that's the cause just drop it.
---
Definitely a bug, try buying or finding another chassis.
---
Awesome. 
---
Is it possible to pick up and move your camp consecutively with you while you move around or is like on a timer of some sort?
---
I made my home a two story. Top floor is my room. Bottom is like a restaurant with the vending machines visible near the bar. Some people really do make them hard to find.
---
Make a new character, it's account wide. Getting out of the vault 100% guarantees you level 2 then delete character.
---
Seen a 800+ running around.
---
You can move your camp as much as you want so long as you have caps(in game currency) to place it down again the more you move the more caps you need
---
You can move it around as much as you like.  You just need to make sure you have the caps to do it. I think it is about 30 caps to move the C.A.M.P.
---
Ooh okay. That's really good to know, thanks!
---
Yeah this one annoyed me cause I either found no stims, or I always had full health until I met someone who killed me, lol
---
Ended up finding stims and just jumping off a cliff spam using them lol
---
If you're at a higher number does your hp cap? Or does it keep going? And can you one shot things? Like say a 75 super mutant?
---
It's probably better early on to just find a good spot and not move it for awhile, eh? Dont wanna be losing caps
---
Doesn't it get more expensive the more you move it though no? Or am I mistaken lol I haven't moved my camp in ages
---
Does anyone else have access to a camp skin for t65? Its a paint that has -1 ap for each paint. Also costs Flux. Anyone else see this?
---
I have no idea. Mine is currently 33 caps, I think. I have moved dozens of times over the past year. Not moved in ages, though.
---
That sucks, Im on 30 something but the xp requirement keeps building up...
---
Yep. Find a good spot!
---
You can always travel back to it for free.
---
Same here lol last time I remember I moved so much the camp placement price kept going up
---
I got to 95% for next level now I have to stop playing until daily resets. Or do another 2 hours of events.
---
I don't know, I mean there are dupers, and glitch abusers ona all the platforms right? 
---
And by the way, is it even possible to fire your gun accurately at your enemies on consoles, I'm genuinely interested in this because every time I try to play anything other than platformers or racing games on a controller, I feel like going through hell.
---
The Crater folks are from WV. They didn't suddenly show up. They fled the Scorched and then returned when their scouts said that it was safe enough. The Foundation folks didn't happen upon an uninhabited land. Sure, you could make the argument that the Crater folks had vacated, but what about us 76ers? Who the fuck do these people think they are, coming in on OUR turf and acting like the highest law? We researched the Scorched. We found a cure. We rebuilt what we could and held the line. Those from Crater are our neighbors from before the Great War. Foundation are essentially foreign invaders trying to take what is ours by right
---
Not sure if it's the same guy but I saw their camp set up under a pylon near priblos curios, they were blasting the USSR anthem on area chat with no one else around.
---
Good luck.
---
In the first few months after fo76 going public we did the same for cheat protection, Beth even got code snippets that would have replaced their "encrypted" scanning for the 3 programs they are after and a faster way for their whitelist.
---
The devs obviously "never got the mail" and the "com-managers" never even acknowledged the problem.
---
&gt;Skyrim V
---
You little trollster, you
---
It’s the final for the wastelanders quest line but not the base quest line which ends with I Am Become Death
---
You will probably have to give money to daddy at this point. You are pretty far behind.
---
But what if Bethesda adds a terminal to the tree
---
 the game aways spawn enemies on your back (no matter the direction) and aways in the middle of their attack animation. theres no chance in this to miss a hit. fucking hate it. ghuls are the worst
---
Better yet, to ALL trees
---
You had a good experience with just a person. There is no community. Everyone is out for themselves. The fo76 playerbase is a bunch of selfish me me me mother fuckers. Just like Houston drivers.
---
Ohh okay okay thank youu as I said I've only been playing for a week or so, so I wasn't sure
---
I asked bcz when I was like 40..50 lvl the same thing happened to me.
---
The reason was to give some gifts.. some veeery expensive gifts.
---
Dont play the game then?
---
And you have to go through 5 screens to harvest any wood
---
I get really high and explore aimlessly, maybe catch up on some lore and get deep into hacking terminals in cool locations. That's after the daily grind.
---
Yes, and a "me hearties" emote for you, my nautical wasteland poet
---
Lol damn I wish I had that one. But nah it seems this guy just wanted to use the vendor with gear in it rather than my plan/recipe ones.
---
Ive already experienced that, having a full build team, then all leave during an event for extra event xp 
---
Like hey if its your cup of tea then by all means enjoy, I just think the dailies should be toned down and made easier, not because its impossible as it is, but it takes so much time and when Im done I usually feel done for the day

I think if the dailies were something that could be done in 10 mins instead of an hour on average time then more would be motivated to keep playing
---
 An infinite wood supply? Bet. Been having issues with my game not resetting sources or detecting when I pick up wood for the score challenges
---
Combined with the window curtains the open doorway becomes a nice entrance to your harem of plushies.
---
There's absolutely no reason you can't have a decent-looking camp but put your vendor machines right around the spawn point.
---
It annoys me other rifles can’t have it
---
I did the exact same thing
---
It is indeed a beautiful game
---
I personally hope for a completely new system to how to level up the season pass in the future, the daily weekly thing is ass 
---
Be much better if you just levelled it up by playing the game
---
No worries
---
lol
---
That's a bit iffy when you cant technically change the spawn.  Moving the camp changes the spawn radius, correct?  I wish I could just use the fast travel mat they already have in the game.
---
Now you're just being pathetic trying to prove a point. Buying 1 ammo from a vendor is not the same as potentially wasting 200+ scrap just to repair 10 items or using 10 repair kits from the SBQ on random crap because you're lazy (like I did). 
---
All I said was that the challenge is way too resource draining  for what it is and, for some reason, you're unwilling to accept it. 
---
Never did I once say I couldn't (or wouldn't) complete it.
---
Thanks, dude! Going there now
---
Not if you do the Wolf Pack event in The forest over and over. 3 legendaries off the bat.
---
Thanks alot! Will head that way soon 😎
---
Thanks for the offer , Xbox sadly 👍
---
Care to share what you have learnt?
---
Yeah, found it. Thanks!
---
I'm saying this so I can get information and rally the voice of the community, we need Bethesda to see our struggle, because we all love the game, we want to see it improve, I want to play this game, but I want to share my thoughts so it can get changed.
---
It is exhaustingly frustrating that Bethesda is forcing us to play NW for those of us not at all interested in that gaming style.
---
Not having to use power armor is great and you melt everything but ammo is kinda a problem but other than that is great
---
Yes, I got ally on settlers and then decided to let the raiders keep the thingy, which put me down to neighbourly... first time I understood how OCD people can feel, lol
---
Watch captain noobs video on his stealth commando. Should work
---
I think I can explain the whole leaving the vault thing.
---
I was a player during the beta, which didn't have achievements enabled, and I used the same character upon release.
---
So in the release version I technically never left the vault.
---
Bethesda didn't think to give achievements to beta players regressively, so unless beta players start a new character; they won't get a number of the achievements.
---
It's dumb, but oh well
---
They shoud not force ppl into NW at the first place, but i believe making option to choose between NW and Adventure quests too hard for Beth. 
---
Also nothing stops person to finish quest in the next game and leave early. For instance someone got 5/6 stimpacks in the past match and then after completing quest in the next game leave. Tweaking like that is just another poor decision and don't solve problem at all.
---
I'm Bloodied Commando on 2 different characters, anything you shoot is a one shot, bigger bosses are like 1 mag, Queen with the right setup is 3 mags. No chems needed on mobs, bosses maybe. Sometimes I just run in and have no issues, sneak one shot usually. You die occasionally, but it's OK.  Using a B2525 Fixer and Unyielding armor also currently, when I'm in my Bolstering armor, I can tank just about anything face to face.

---
Yes dude I was thinking about this. They need to add Watoga and Top of the World.
---
There's a really good chance a lot of players don't have the achievement for leaving the vault because if you played during the beta, any achievements you may have "completed" weren't retroactively completed on full game release.
---
I'm level 150, and I only just got the achievement for reaching level 10 a few days ago.
---
You probably know this but check out angry turtle he has a few sneak builds and always shows gameplay keep out the light 😛
---
Oh god that sucks lol. How the hell do people get both to max and then keep it there I'll never know, mine are already out of sync and trying to think how to keep them both happy the whole time is gonna be a chore!
---
yes pls!
---
I know im going to enjoy it.
---
Just make a new account and level that up. That’s what I did and it works
---
Thanks ,I'm going to watch it now.
---
I've been logging in, doing dailies, and logging out to play another game. The game is more grind and repetitive work than content at this point.
---
I got suspended sooooooo
---
There's an alien corpse somewhere in the Ash Heap. I hope they add a Zetan DLC though with a world boss in like the Mire.
---
No.
---
i shall spread the word on ps4
---
MOTHMAN IS GOD
---
The bridge is the best loot spot imho on that map.
---
I'm still transitioning my perks across and with a few of them not working at the moment makes it difficult to see what my final setup will be.looking forward to being able to use the fixer like you say you use it.
---
The early-game is so alluring, getting out of Vault 76 and being assaulted with quests and events, it's amazing, but about 150 hours later, it's a chore, I'm not saying I don't have fun on occasion, but the season is making me want to grind out XP to get max XP to never worry about dailies again
---
Haha.. I've still never seen the Colossus, I check every time!
---
Not sure it's getting easy asf for me. Past three days and today the challenges were done in under an hour a half.
---
Fuck Ward, he gotta take better care of his shit
---
Cool.Ive watched a few of his informative videos,didn't think to look for commando advice.
---
I’ve been hiding in the room with the vendor bots, crouched, in stealth armor 🤣. I never do anything, but I’ll eventually wave and watch them panic.
---
Try explosive weapons.  The explosive stuff impacts the weapons.  Make sure gunsmith is not used.  Do the weapons actually have to break or just be repaired?  If only repaired, then as soon as it drops a bit repair.
---
Nice! Wish PS did something similar!
---
And how hard were you going at the dupes then?
---
Get them off of enemies and repair them. If you are using things that boost your Luck up too high to loot weapons and armor that are damaged, unequip them (like Unyielding armor)
---
If it's an events team, I assume it's because I didn't join their event immediately.
---
If it's a building team, I assume it's because they want a friend or a low level.
---
Some people are doing it just to be mean, but usually the two assumptions have proven to be true so far (for me)
---
Second paragraph
---
I dont get it. why u just didnt kill the 20 lvl player? And what is so funny?
---
Not even this. I open the game, after five minutes of considering if I should play, I close the game. Fallout 76 doesn't really motivate me to play.
---
Just repaired and it applies to armor too
---
Survive 30 minutes is fine, that is the entire point of the game mode, and going into increasingly small circles with 30+ people are still alive is tense and stressful in a way that enhances the gamemode for everyone even if half of them aren't full on trying to kill you. It is a challenge that gets you to play the game mode in a natural way, stay alive at all costs.
---
It's the weird ones that require you to do something unnatural like killing dozens of creatures that are really dumb because you normally aren't going out of your way to track down random ghouls.
---
My first character was kinda a "Jask of All Trades" build (Master of None), so I could see what I liked in 76, but I always default to Rifleman/Commando in Fallout games. My second character was a well planned build, she has over 250 level perks unused still. Played on my first characters bad build until I stacked up 60 levels to respec. Takes a while, but worth it.
---
Okay I'll try that
---
You don't like Fallout 76:Seinfeld Edition?
---
Great. My ign is 1Atlas25
---
Sorry didn’t read 😂
---
As far as I’m concerned no it never effected me I don’t think
---
Admittedly, back in August, purchasing FO76 itself was a drunk buy.
---
I was less than impressed with the reveal and decided to hold back from buying until after release - then everyone and their dog was saying how bad it was - so I just never purchased it, laughed at all the articles about it being terrible and generally forgot it existed.
---
Fast Forward from March to August, sorta sick of playing FO4 for the nth time, another FNV was on hold until F4NV released (and is still is) - but some people were starting to say that 76 wasn't nearly as bad as the press was making it appear, decided fuck it and purchased it.
---
Best drunk buy ever, it was no where near as 'mmo' as I expected, the story was pretty neat and I liked that they actually gave reasons for certain aspects being included - for example in FO3 there is no valid lore reason for Caps to be used, but in FO76 they actually gave a nice little backstory on why caps hold value in Appalachia.
---
Headsup, it's only ~30 seconds walk to the Asylum, which has workbenches on the top floor.
---
I duped things to share with the boys but by my last hours it was my bud who was hardcore duping while I took a nap and afk in a station 
---
Woke up to this account is not authorized 
---
Then got an email later
---
I just went to location with low level enemies (near Mothman museum), killed some guys, loot thier lvl1-5 guns and armor and repaired them. That's it
---
it's not really a spawn radius from my experimentation it's a spawn point and you can definitely move it around by moving the camp but where you pop in seems inconsistent sometime. I almost always spawn in to my camp in one spot. visitors usually spawn in the middle of my camp.
---
Who needs mothman when you have MR FUZZY! He’s your friend and he loves to play! Join MR FUZZY...or be eaten alive by his minions.
---
u/ladydevann u/valseek
---
You find stims in just about every normal container, don't bother with the gun crates. I ran around, grabbed 6, ran to the outside circle and spammed all 6 in one go, took me about 5 - 10 minutes. (I hate NW and normally skip the challenges)
---
"Good With Salt" will keep your perishables springtime fresh for a good long while.
---
I'm fairly certain they mean Fallout 1st, not Fallout 1/2
---
Why would it be permanent? No, it's an immediate effect like all chems, you lose a bit of your thirst and hunger bars on use.
---
Disagree. yeah a round lasts around 20 minutes so thats atleast two matches, one where you have to survive until the end, and one where you need to get halfway through atleast. If you like nuclear winter then its just another day another game, but think about the ones who hate the game mode, who die in the first circle 7 times in a row. Theres a reason theres so many bush wookies, not because of the intense gameplay but because not everybody enjoys pvp, but still want the reward 
---
30 min challenge is beyond overkill for the challenge, its also the worst to come home from work and know that when youve done your adventure mode chores you have to play a gamemode you dont neccessarily want to play that specific day for fucking 30 minutes, and thats not taking into consideration the time it takes to load into a game, the downtime if you loose or crash etc. Its straight up an awful challenge and should be cut shorter by more than half it serves no purpose other than fuelling more hate to the game mode which is in desperate need of love right now
---
Edit: deffo with the creature thing, I wouldnt mind if it was one two or three creature kills, but again 9 is overkill, last I did that challenge I left my team hanging cause I was hunting rad scorpios, thankfully they were able players and they even secures us a win with atleast 13 kills them between, then Im coming with 3 kills and 9 creature kills... its just dumb
---
Daguerre's babble is almost as annoying as the elevator music at Whitespring - except you can't hum along, eh?
---
I went the other way lol. Started out as rifleman/commando, then went melee for the insane damage.
---
High Perception, Agility, and Luck are key.
---
Perception for Commando perks, Tank Killer (armor penetration), and Concentrated Fire. The damage boost you get from CF is negligible, but at 3* every shot in VATS, regardless of whether or not it hits, increases your hit chance by 20%. I would always target the head and, so long as I was within range to VATS, I’d land headshots. I chose not to use Ground Pounder because I didn’t need the hip fire accuracy and Speed Demon already increased my reload speed.
---
Agility for general sneak boost, Action Boy/Girl, Covert Operative, Escape Artist, Adrenaline (when it works again), and Gun Fu. With 15 AGI and a full set of Unyielding or four pieces and one Chameleon, you don’t need Sneak. Gun Fu is amazing for VATS, though I recommend only getting 1-2 stars in it, as I rarely utilized the benefits of the third. Mister Sandman is also an amazing perk card to switch in at night.
---
Then Luck for crits. I ran Serendipity, Bloody Mess, Starched Genes, Grim Reaper’s Sprint, and Critical Saavy. I rarely ran out of AP and I was stacking crits one after another. That being said, you’ll be dealing out so much sneak damage running Bloodied, crits won’t even matter for most enemies. You’ll really only see its effectiveness against the SBQ and ISS. Outside of those fights, Critical Saavy can be swapped out for something more useful for everyday use.
---
As for buffs, I rarely used them outside of Psycho and Ballistic Bock, and even then it was only for the SBQ and ISS.
---
For mods, I always used suppressor, aligned stock and grip, stinging magazine, and hardened receiver (or prime if you can craft plenty of ultracite ammo).
---
I hope this helps. I miss how deadly and safe a stealth commando build is.
---
Nice but they still work without power, they just don't appear on the map.
---
Edit: they patched it which is great news.
---
I have had this issue for two weeks! I will give it a try fingers crossed
---
Starting out any form of 'request' with a shot across the bow in the title seems likely to work. /s
---
it’s a random encounter
---
You don't have to break them, only repair. And it doesn't have to cost lots of resources to do so - avoid modded weapons and instead pick up lots of basic stuff like axes or Super Mutant boards.
---
Hah is all good, its deffo the fastest way, but I just find it too dumb to do everyday, hah
---
I'm usually decent in these game modes, but I get instantly smoked before I can even try a challenge.
---
Happy Big Trees. &lt;3
---
The fact knowing you have to complete all the daily and weekly challenges to get to 100 has burnt me out in the game. This season pass has done nothing good to make players comeback long term.
---
You get xp for each goul killed, plus xp for completing the event. Can easily get way over 10k xp per radiation rumble event.
---
It is not invalid to express themselves. It is not a pleasant situation for us peeps who do not enjoy PVP or NW platform. You respond with a solution, there are many. Alas, if there wasn't a problem to "complain" about, it wouldn't be so easy to come up with so many solutions. The real question is though, will Beth consider our feelings in this relationship and make changes? We shall see.
---
Here in Britain, we have a queen who is just a symbolic figurehead, but as FO76 crashes when a nuke drops I'm reminded that there are queens that have no meaningful encounters.
---
Yeah I know, I actually enjoy it quite alot lol so to begin with when starting the challenge I wanted to do it legit, but had so bad luck that day and basically I did what you did at the end of the day, hah
---
Also polls should be allowed
---
Can people just *not* ya know? Do they cheat in every fuckin game they play or just this one? 
---
What's the point of duping? All you do is slash the game content down to nothing by breezing it, and there's no satisfaction in finding a perfect gun or taking care to ensure supplies last as you just clone more.
---
Hope dupers get taken out totally. Fuck suspension just terminate that shit.
---
I hate it. If anything makes me quit, it will be this. I don't actually play anymore. I realize I don't *have* to do the dailies with every account, but I don't want to miss out on stuff.
---
That joke would work even better if regular scorched beasts were pedos
---
Not impossible tho
---
That must be it then.  Have they ever worked for you, or has it always been that way?
---
I really appreciate the response!
---
Its a nuclear winter bug (idk) 
---
If you play nuclear winter and then go into adventure it happens, you get rid of it by restarting the game *sigh*
---
Cool,  We still have like, the better part of eight weeks to get it. Looks like this Run isn't as impossible as people said!
---
Anything else?
---
I'm sorry you feel that way and that your experience hasn't been as good. However, I would like to point out that I've had a good experience with multiple people, as you can read in my post.
---
I feel you man, been doing all the challenges thus far but Im over the entire thing, gonna keep on going but I wont be happy about it lol
---
Riding shotgun is good but project paradise is the best if you have people helping
---
Yes.

Lat least scrapbench would be nice. But I disagree with the rest
---
What platform?
---
Edit: sorry, Ps4. Just woken up.
---
I'll give you a serum for free :)
---
I'm British and I agree lmao
---
Ohh right! Yeah actually doing this legit would probably take longer than 24 hours lol; I doubt most people pop that many stims (if any) per match.
---
thanks took me a while to get the tables and chairs lined up perfectly to really bring out the diner vibe. and yeah both kitchen areas have sinks, as well as stoves, fridges, and even safes where the vendor sells from. The slocum joe vendors are awesome. Better than the originals by a hard mile.
---
Hah trust me man, they can burn up rather quickly lol
---
It says PS4 help so I'm assuming that's his console
---
This post was an attempt to complain about anything.
---
-I'm a basic Fallout 1st user, who uses my tent except the features it doesn't have, and will pay atoms for cosmetics already available, or for base game functions.
---
Anyway, I'm grumpy before coffee myself. The solution is making a simple mobile camp, not necessarily a floating camp, that has everything you need everywhere you want.
---
Perhaps 30 minutes is too long, that can always be argued, but all challenges can be made bad if they are too long, I would loath a survive 60 minutes, or other insanity inducing levels of challenge even though I enjoy the game mode, but the idea of a challenge to survive I don't take offense to because it is a normal thing to do, pick locks, kill creatures, and the like are questionable when they get to more than 2-3, which they regularly have. 
---
As for people who die seven times in the first circle. If you are that bad you don't complete the challenge, that is not the challenge's fault, surviving 5 minutes minimum should be something an average player should be able to do more often than not if that is their goal, AFK players can do it. If you are choosing to spawn in high traffic areas and fist fight people in heavy armor with guns as your first action of a match then you should not be surprised at all if you die often. 
---
I could see the argument for going from 30 to 15-20, one good game rather than 2-3, but I think the idea is fine.
---
I ran into someone who had their camp floating in the air only accesible with jetpack.
---
Then another guy had the camp laid out so you had to walk on power connector piping like tightropes to make it to the vendors... all to find out the 30 “weapons” were homemade lead pipes 💯😡
---
I guess it is the same amount of xp u need in order to lvl up after reaching a certain point.    If not the difference is not sooo big.
---
You can use repair kits also. It will count.
---
What happens in get out I never saw it
---
The Vault level-up doesn't count, actually. But people have put out advice on how to grind out that additional level in just a few minutes.
---
Why not ask for an AI bot to play the game for you ?
---
When? because someone was buying stuff from my powered down vendor around 3 days ago. Definitely after the SCORE patch - and I dont recall any patches since.
---
Thank you for the time that took to write.I will defiantly utilize this info.
---
Hmmm we’re moving towards a common ground  but I think Ill have to disagree still, haha! 
---
Lets settle on 15 minutes 
---
And sadly some people are that bad... should they not be allowed the extra 250 score or should the challenge aim more for everybody (I dont mean for this to sound all snowflaky and stuff, but I think this season pass should be more lighthearted and fun rather than long tedious and grindy)
---
If it wasn't something that pretty much required you to stay on top of the grind to complete by the time limit, I wouldn't mind so much. For example, if you could just get score from playing (not just 100 per 10k exp) without a limit, then I would just play one account at a time for a while, then switch. But knowing that if I lose a week of not doing dailies that I might miss out on completing the entire thing, it forces me to basically just do dailies every day instead of playing.
---
I found the turret board and accidentally scrapped it, so the quest has gone a bit weird now and all he ever asked me to find is a turret board.
---
I might have said "Animal Crossing", but apparently the fandom can be rather... cutthroat. Which surprised me to hear.
---
Ward is a dick. I sided with them, and I diligently farmed their reputation without glitches or any other shortcuts, one quest at a time.
---
BUT ONCE, and I mean once, when I was just starting, I tried bargaining with the raider who stole their equipment. I wanted to see if there was a way out without a fight, and I misunderstood the dialogue (not an english native but I have the game set to english), so I ended up having them pay me to keep the item.
---
Flash forward, 2 months ahead, Ward still greets me with "I understand you have your reasons, but foundation really needed that [equipment]". Every. Single. Day.
---
So wholesome, I love it.
---
Dude, I was just saying that! The entire thing should be toned down so that by playing the game the way you want to play will passively level you up, then levels will be gradually more difficult and maybe the last levels can be a lil grindy etc, if given enough time this would be the best way to proceed
---
If I go for lvl up I do it in 20..25 min. West-Tek with bufs = 20k xp + Charlstone´s Capitolium = almost 10k + Prime or whatever place with highlvl mobs = sure enogh to lvl u up.
---
Line in the Sand = 20k+
---
Its... ok ig. Doesnt rlly look like it .
---
Well that would be because one achievement has been in the game since launch and literally anyone at any lvl can do it, the other takes like two months of a high lvl character grinding to achieve. I’d be fucking worried if it was the other way around
---
There is one sitting out in the open on the roof of West Tek...they’re not rare
---
Just keep in mind that if you build outside the Forest area it becomes possible for people to nuke your camp; either on purpose or accidentally as they nuke the area. So if you're outside the safe zone check the map everytime someone launches a nuke and make sure that your C.A.M.P. is safe. If it's in the red circle you can quit to menu before it lands and be safe.
---
Or the Karma Pharma Farma card?
---
I haven't noticed this. But maybe its patch related? Not sure if its possible to have different visuals for each player depending on the reputation.
---
Lol
---
If you don't have one yet add me psn: Pierre1992 can give you one for free will be online in 30
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they were doing that. Just repair shotguns at a workbench instead of using repair kits. Sure it takes up junk, but it's not like you can't easily get more.
---
Bethesda need to give us a spawn point marker, my CAMP is one huge room with lots of different sections, vendors are directly in front of the door. I spent so long making it obvious where they were.
---
...then the game decides to spawn people off the edge of a cliff instead so they either fall to their death or have a 20 minute walk to my vendors.
---
I'm so tired of spawning under water, under foundations, inside of walls or a million miles away from the vendor
---
I'm using this mod now - very helpful!
---
They won’t ✌️
---
I recall the mandatory monthly fee model was already tried with ESO, and it was not successful. Most players (particularly those who do not play that much anyway) just do not want to pay anything beyond the initial purchase of the game, and even the price of that is being pushed down over time.
---
Yes, this is exactly what I think the majority of the playerbase would prefer. Be rewarded for playing when you have time.
---
Some people can play for like 10 hours a day maybe one or two days a week. Some maybe can play that much every day. But don't punish people by limiting the methods of completing objectives with time-gated material, while also time-gating the entire event.
---
Yes, some people will finish super fast. That's fine. Let them. It's not a race. You do you, and let me do me. I would much rather be able to just play one account for 2 weeks, complete the event by just playing very regularly, and then switch to another account.
---
This way, I'm able to just play the game to earn rewards and progress instead of logging in to 4 accounts to do dailies.
---
I feel the same way. I hop on to do challenges and right now I’m working on buying 4 or 5 more serums.(maybe 30 minutes a day playtime) After I buy those serums I will have every plan on the game (except those from holiday events I missed). And then what?  Grind mindsight will be over for me and there’s no narrative to fall back on
---
One thing to save this game is difficulty imo. I don’t want people to tell me to start a new character(I have 4) or to use sucky guns to give the appearance it’s a harder game.  I want to die with my Min/max build. Maybe colossal problem will bring more difficulty. But that will get boring just like queen event
---
They tried to make vault raids hard but I ended up spending 8 hours trying to find the damn keys.  That was a lame idea and hence why it’s gone
---
There is hope and they have the technology to make the game great. But adding new challenges and atom shop items isn’t going to do it. 
---
Seems they care more about newbies than vets.  
---
I started a new fallout 3 with hella mods two days ago.
---
So four guys turned up to your camp. 
---
You had pacifist mode on so wasn't in pvp. 
---
How was this griefing and not just a team that came over to you?
---
If you have other running speed buffs it doesnt work for some reason.  Try equipping squad manouvres rank 1 and youll see you run slower than without it equiped.
---
And an added bonus when kill 10 robots is also one of the challenges.
---
I found one house where they were on the third floor behind a level 3 locked door.  WHY!!!!
---
A bunch of white old dudes want to take over bodies of black people
---
Someone started shooting my Slocum Joe's robots and then started shooting me with his explosive shotgun. He learned why I always carry stealth boys and a bloodied tesla rifle on my even though I hate PVP. He gave up after seeking revenge 4 times and I made 250caps.
---
Yeah already starting saving perk points 🤣
---
Yes, cranberry bog
---
Make your own goals. See what the random events offer. Tame a pet!
---
I have nearly 2k hours now and thought I'd really seen it all, but there are a ton of locations I haven't explored yet. Right now I'm server hopping to find a Flatwoods Monster for a picture to complete my Cryptid photo series. They're all black and white grainy shots with the monster in the background, maybe a bit out of focus to get that tabloid Bigfoot photo look.
---
I ran into the hunter event where he's tracking a radstag. I had my Shishkebab out and the dude said to me, "what are you going to do with *that*? Kill it and cook it at the same time?" It was so specific! There's a lot I haven't found yet, kind of surprised.
---
Nuke mines I mean...
---
Yes.  It's pretty quick to make a new character and get them to level 3 (level 2 doesn't count because it's scripted when you leave the vault), then delete the character.
---
Low damage
---
Hard for them to take this seriously when the comment is just swearing at them
---
I'm a complete newb level 3. This feels me with hope and wholesomeness. Imagine if the real world was like this. Great story, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.
---
Im impressed you lined all those up and took a pic without them getting recalled
---
Yeah but when you talk to him it's pretty likely that he survived the war and just became a ghoul kinda that vault tech guy who knocks on your door in the beginning of the game
---
Thanks, but I already got it :D
---
If they were hard people just complain it takes too long
---
Challenges are the worse so called "content".
---
It's ok if you're a kid. But what are you supposed to do when you're 40? I guess I'm too old for video games.
---
Ok cool
---
The ones from vending machines didn't work for me. I'll try again. Either way you motivated me to submit tickets for the things that have been bugging me (pun intended): No possum badges dropping, no technical data dropping, the scrap I want to keep has been auto-scrapping out my stash (farewell souvenir Nuka Cola Toy Car)
---
No one said I ordered it - I said that's why people were upset. You are one angry kid, rofl. Don't argue with me, argue with the people in quantity enough to send shockwaves and change the an entire industry worldwide. You realize the biggest ripoff was the game at the time, right? It's gotten better but way worse than the bag, was the game in 2018.
---
My God you're bad at the internet.
---
True, but you wouldn’t get a radio signal all the way from the Commonwealth.
---
Oh. Sounds weird. Wouldn't watch
---
Isn't it?
---
I would when I’m not playing mine (it’s a bit different I’m PA with Team Medic and friendly fire and a flamer) and my friends like me playing it especially when there on there melee chars.
---
160 hours, level 68. I've only done the first ten main quests, and about 5 or 6 side missions. Been building camps, exploring and completing events this whole time. The camp building really fills a void left from another game called Miscreated. Good game, but base building takes at least 2-3 times as long.
---
They doubled the number of stimpacks you need to find IIRC
---
A - it’s oblivion
---
B - I don’t read books
---
I think you have to do a minimum damage think it’s 1-2k deters people from turning up and hiding/not contributing to the fight
---
To be honest, I always expected the legendary perks to cost thousands of levels to max out (one perk point every few tens of levels on average), from the time they were announced the first time. That is exactly the point of adding them, this is not meant to be like a single player game, where one can "100%" all the content in a few weeks, and then move on to something else. But that is difficult to accept for so many who came from the single player Fallouts, and 76 may even be their first online game ever.
---
In addition to making the ceiling of time investment required to have everything higher, balance is also an issue, as you already mentioned. The game is for the most part very easy for experienced high level players as it is, and adding even more power creep does not help with that. I guess the One Wasteland normalization could change the situation, at least in theory, but I suspect enemies will still be be capped at level ~68, so it will not really make a difference for end game players outside the originally low level areas like the Forest.
---
Ye I thought about flamer and friendly fire initially but on my heavy build I find fuel isn't that sustainable. That might change though with the new legendary perks!
---
Please explain.  
---
I'm using Lever action Rifle and Handmade both 2\* with 2 shot explosive and ultracite ammo on a stealth build.
---
What would you recommend?
---
There is a minimum damage requirement and she is a flying tank. You need to switch on damage numbers and see what you are actually doing.
---
You need to deal a certain ammount of damage, to avoid lazy people getting stuff for just one shot. Maybe try getting a better gun or change your perks. (If you aren't in the ingame)
---
However if you have good perks and guns, it might be a bug
---
On occasion my friends have kicked people to make room for other friends that just logged on etc. I understand it's a bit of a dick move but pub groups are easy enough to find / start.
---
You can kill 3 legendaries running leader of the pack, a low level event. Not really worth 750 score lol.
---
trading with other player who doesnt use 5.56 with other ammo, but honestly the best way is craft it urself or farming mutant, if u r short on ammo, use sniper build instead of commando
---
That's the best! You can grab lead from the weight rooms at the hotel in Flatwoods, and at the Charleston FD for lead, and I usually do Uranium Fever, pick everything up, and scrap it for steel. Also Rad Rumble is great for steel.
---
got it. maybe they should autocomplete the whole run for their very important player?  if u r so annoyed to complete 5 simple challenges (less than 1 our to get them all) there must be an easy way.
---
Or just power armor and a shitty gun again. Back to the roots it is
---
Thank you! Will check these out
---
I'm really glad! I hope you'll also run into as many friendly wastelanders as I have - in my experience, fellow players are usually pretty happy to lend a hand!
---
Well imo I'm not got spend money to advance my level but the board itself rewards you with 1500 atoms which I intend to save till the end so I can buy the last 10 ( and hardest to finish) for free
---
Removed by system hahaha, honestly if one doesn't equip the perks that messed up bloodied build they are hardly get kicked
---
West Tek and Lucky Hole is still going to be your best option.
---
make it, use ammo perk and super duper.
---
Either buy bulk lead from robots, or farm it from dumbbells (Charleston Fire Dept, Prison yard, etc... they're heavy af (5-80 lbs, so find a nearby workbench before you grab them)
---
Whitespring vendor
---
I have 2 shot explosive rifles that do 200+ damage.  I also have all 3 Rifleman cards at level 3 and Glow Sighted at level 3.  Plus Covert Operative for 2.15x damage.
---
Interact with players - Gives the funnest experience and maybe you’ll learn some stuff from them
---
Bro if this was on xbox my friend Feumsi would go nuts.
---
Ok then ignore my comment. Thats really weird, maybe bug/glitch?
---
I don't recommend medic weapons because as far as I can tell they're still broken and don't do anything. What I did for a similar build was Team Medic 3, the perk that makes stims/radaway work faster, blanking on the name, and Friendly Fire 3. The flamer is fun, but a shishkebab works better--but that's really only for after a fight is over. You don't really have time in a fight for Friendly Fire unless you're using it to heal and damage simultaneously.
---
I think being a medic in this is fun but half the time people manage their own health before I can.
---
Thank you! Used it before, but the grind gets boring really fast
---
Queen has damage resistance, also I believe she is immune to the explosive effect, turn on the damage indicator in the settings to see how much you are doing, go for head shots when she lands.
---
Alright i'll stick to those. Thank you!
---
go to purveyor now and get ur god roll! Rarely see glowing Yao Guai spawn there, most of them are the low level one
---
Yea I was thinking of hopping back into New Vegas.I recently started a heavily modded play through that I could play a bit more.
---
I'm sorry dude but theres no why you did this without exploits of some kinda cuz I've been in stuck at home and play way more than I like to admit with a full unyielding stealth cammando and I'm only at 32
---
😂😂😂😂😂
---
Wait there are trophies lmao. Im level 287
---
Moldy trash lol but yes I agree happen to me twice during encrypted and at the queen.
---
Lol not gonna lie it was close.
---
I put 3 vendors in front of my house and 1 on 4th floor of maze which usually contains ammo and other stuff like steel or screw for cheap price because i want other to have some fun new place to explore or play around with. Since i plan to move soon, i wonder what you guy think about this setup. Should i just put all vendor at first floor or do you enjoy camp like maze with reward on top more?   
---
If only i have a box to put item to reward player that finish my maze i would do that but now all i can think is vendor with cheap price only.
---
Sometimes this is a bug with a fusion core in you inventory that still thinks its equiped. Try putting all your cores into your stash or dropping them and picking them back up.
---
Got a legit Plasma Grenade Plan from an event, can't sell it because it's duped. Yesterday a lvl.412 came to my camp, dropped a b2550 50cal and a BE1 Handmade and left. It's crazy but sad. I meam these guns are great but I wanted to grind for those
---
Explore. 
---
Don’t rush the main questlines. 
---
Avoid fast traveling early on. 
---
Repair gear at workbenches using scrap (not repair kits)
---
Have a melee weapon handy to conserve ammo
---
Scrap and store junk regularly
---
Make healing salves along the River bank so you are never low on stimpacks
---
Another alternative (Only if you're Ally Rank with Crater) is buying the Ammo machine from Crater for Gold Bullion. It gives you 5x 5.56 ammo every minute. I use this to sell them since I don't use them, but for some reason it seems that only 5.56 is the ones being produced at 5 rounds a minute. If I select 308 for example it only gives me 1 every minute.
---
You can just use a player vendor
---
If that's true then great! I'll check it out right now
---
You don't need a friend to, any player vendor in Adventure works. Just go shopping and buy one piece of ammo.
---
Yeah, it works. Much easier than finding someone to trade with.
---
Get the herd mentality mutation if u play in groups. Get +2 to all stats. +3 if u have strength in numbers perk card
---
That's uh... not really the point. I don't literally mean that it's hard or more difficult, but it requires more effort to kill 3 legendaries than it would 1 for a daily.
---
If we're going to have the same exact dailies with smaller or bigger numbers, they could be tweaked in order to give more score. 750 was also just an example, I mentioned 500-750 since they're intervals of 250.
---
Try some anti-meta builds. Find the dumbest weapons out there, build a character around them and make them work. I've been doing this a bit when not doing the score board. I just levelled a nocturnal sniper to see if that effect deserves the mockery it gets. It does not. Next I'm going caveman as I have a 3* beserker's spear.
---
Are they doing that damage to the queen? Do you have your damage numbers turned on? I would be shocked if you are putting that much damage into her per shot.
---
Take your time. Rushing ahead normally leads to being under leveled during the main quest. Don't worry about builds or min/max until after level 50. Odds are that you won't have the gear or perk cards to make a build until level 60+ (for me it was level 80).
---
Ye I can see people are likely to sort their own health first, which is why I liked medics prefix as it can basically tick over passively while I support, but I've been looking into it how close you have to be for teammates to benefit which makes the whole thing a pretty pointless mechanic. 
---
Thanks Bethesda!
---
Some guy liked grinded it to 100 in like a couple days on stream. It’s definitely not impossible. Especially with the exp repeat. Find a path with a lot of high exp enemies, use buffs and run it over and over until you hate yourself, the game, Bethesda studios, and the space time continuum and then you’ll be there
---
They don’t need to fully break to repair them. Just pick up weapons and armor off enemies and repair those. Easy
---
haha doors..
---
i walk into camps and switch off the lights
---
A value? I can buy max caps for 3.00usd, that's no value at all.
---
Never seen it there, I’ll keep checking
---
I feel you. I just today completed My Raiders on 100%. I did only Settlers since release then started at raiders some time ago for the raiders ammo production.
---
Im so done with these quests. Now I realy feel that the level up daily bullshit is such a chore.
---
I'd put all my points into a legendary perk that had auto loot but even just a dead body detector for legendary meet piles.
---
Lead farming as you game is decebt but if you can put some time aside to specifically farm lead you shouldnt havr to grind as a chore.
---
Grab every can and combination wrench you can find. Even can alarm thingys (the string of cans you rattle as you pass).
---
Paint tins at watoga high art near the cafeteria, overseers house has 2 makeshift batteries with some lead. Flatwoods has some paint cans about.
---
Go find a settlement camp with a lead deposit at the start of your gaming time and just set up a lead extractor with some turrets as you leave to find more lead, you could get the ammo factory settlement too as it has a lead deposit and make ammo on the side.
---
Previously mentioned perks like super duper and ammo help, happy go lucky for extra luck w/ alcohol or daddy-o can make a bit faster, +1 luck apparel when crafting too.
---
If you get stuck and want to make caps to buy lead for crafting from vebdorbots/ammo dispensers i found green thumb perk and trawling the river around flatwoods to the eastern edge of the map collecting glowing mushrooms and trawling for antiseptic to make radaway (iirc you can get the plans from the whitesprings bunker medical wing) is a great little money maker when you use the chemist, superduper perks and raise your luck.
---
Same here.  I figure my stuff better be reasonably priced if people are going to fast travel all the way up by WV lumber to see what I have.   I like my camp location but it's in a terrible spot when it comes to fast travel costs lol.
---
Plus tons of side quests. Do you also have all the allies at your camp yet? 2 of them have their own questlines as well.
---
Literally tells you if you read the challenge
---
😳
---
Nobody can steal anything from your stash. 
---
People can’t destroy your camp unless you are hostile to them.
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Once again. Its not possible.
---
And you are the 300th person so make this very suggestion.
---
I really dont wanna piss you off but this gets suggested every 3 days or so and everytime the awnser is the same.
---
Mirelurk meat turn in?
---
I really wish team comp mattered more in this. It might not be a popular opinion but I'd love it if people needed to fill out the MMO holy trinity of tank, healer, DPS.
---
oh
---
The only thing im fighting is the fast travel system atm 😂
---
the new ammo converter and the ammo forge or whatever it’s called from the raiders would be a big help i believe, i’ve only just gotten into ammo crafting myself for my mini-gun build, steel and acid are something i’m always struggling with.
---
What weapons would you recommend then, bearing in mind I'm not a tank and play lightweight stealth.
---
Are Gause Rifles any good and do they fit with Rifleman Perk Cards.
---
Thanks all so far for your responses.
---
That would be cool!  And if you steal from them, you can't run the event again for a set period of time because obviously they would be pissed off.
---
Wow thank you! Will try all of those!
---
I just need the backpack. Really looking forward to that
---
I wish i had your thought process tbh. I get on and I play a bit and then i get to the IM BOOOORRREEED stage. Thats when i zone out and run around with my power fist killing things without thinking.
---
Most underrated tip on this sub. Especially if the imposter turns invisible as it dies in encryptid.
---
But it does not get x2 xp bonus, or does it?
---
Hmm.. I've experimented with several different spots and each time it gave me a random radius for spawns.  Sometimes in the mountainside, foundations and if im lucky it will be a clean spawn.   Where I have it now I will spawn in my courtyard most of the time but still end up in the cliff from time to time.
---
Fully bonded building team, stacking XP buffs in radiation rumble, glitched line in the sand, along with a secret grinding place using only game mechanic but works like exploits do the job pretty fast
---
It's on level 50.
---
Thanks for the offer! And the answer
---
They would have to push your pictures as display assets to all other players game files/installs and vice versa....messy  :-)
---
FYI pretty sure while that spreadsheet tells you WHEN double xp and double score are, it does not calculate how much you would get in the right hand column. 
---
So no that is not true.
---
Just a note people can still use your vendors just takes it off the map. 
---
And personally I don’t get this. I always wait on the basis that this person restocking may be restocking the exact thing I need 
---
Being a 👶 makes me miss out on that 😅
---
Or when you try to loot a dead body thats under a plant and its like harvest plant. And your like no idc about you i just want the body. I think in some cases when it comes to looting bodies should come before harvesting plants. But thats just me.
---
There's just not a viable solution to this, think of every player, and their camp, and then all the stuff they have, all their inventory's, paint on each gun and armor, all the water purifiers, and collection robots, and now, add in power armor, with all the mods and paint schemes on those. It would overload the server. We have cheap servers now, this would kill it.
---
Don't get me wrong, I would love it! I wish there was a way to make it work but I just don't see it happening.
---
that's what I'm saying most of the time you spawn in the same spot but every so often you just randomly spawn somewhere else. I don't think it like I said I don't think it's so much a radius as it is just you spawn in a general location in a certain direction from and distance from your camp box
---
Long story short is - every player would need to download everyones photos to see them wich wouldnt work too much space would be needed.
---
If it would only be client side other players wouldnt be abel to see your photos but instead maybe theire own which wouldnt just be the same or work the way you would like to.
---
By any chance was it was vats shots?
---
Fair enough
---
It’s worked for me. It’s also better than say...nothing. Or dumping on people for trying.
---
Don’t forget the playground ride pulled out of the game and dumped into our laps, as though we’re supposed to know what the hell to do with it, lol.
---
You both have to add each other to your friends list otherwise it doesn't work.
---
I love the thought of instances that require a healer and there's just one bloke running around with a flamethrower burning his team mates with love
---
They need to put PA display stands. Would visit your exhibit, 10/10.
---
I actually use the curtain method for the entrance to my hallway. I use to over use thr curtains that way in previous CAMP builds.
---
Get a Fixer. Just a regular Fixer or Bloodied if you can get one. It uses 45s. Get another Fixer and mod it to use 38s. Alternate between weapons depending on how tough the enemies are. This makes more use of collected ammo and can stretch your 5.56s much further.
---
It's pretty random from what I've seen but I always spawn within a certain distance from the camp.  I can be on any side of the C.A.M.P. when I spawn in and I've yet to notice any pattern with mine... I wonder if location of the C.A.M.P. placement impacts the spawns..? For ex.  Camp being too close to a wall.
---
Why thank you, I didn't even notice... \^\^
---
BRB, gotta figure out where to do some farming post... ;-)
---
What people don't realize is they have a massive backlog of bugs / updates / new features to implement that have been auggested to them.  They need to evaluate each one, approve it, develop it, test it, and deploy it.  This takes time, to the tune of months and months just for a handful of those suggestions if they even get approved at all.    
---
People not familiar with software development  (not saying this is or isn't you, just speaking in general) don't realize how long this actually takes and expects bug fixes or new features within days.  Ok maybe not days but you get the point.
---
Yeah sorry about that I did ramble on a bit last night
---
But he isnt even showing up when i search him on the ingame social friendlist as well as i do not show up on his
---
I want a fast travel mat from 4 so my camp entrance will actually be the spawn point
---
You’re likely going to have to change things up for the queen. I bring a 50 cal or Gatling gun  with me usually. I usually don’t even end up swapping in heavy weapon perks. When she lands, use a good melee weapon to her head. Damage adds up fast. 
---
Basically you will want something with a solid fire rate. Make sure you have damage numbers turned on so you can know if you are hurting her. Also headshots are best.
---
It’s possible it’s just mind numbingly boring and life ruiningly Grindy. 
---
For The average player, I have missed two day’s playing and have played a couple of hours each night I’ve played since the update and I think I’m a couple of spaces away from the first gap. 
---
A large amount of my playtime in the first few days was trying to get the ghillie suit in NW though so I could have done Better I suppose.
---
My problem is that I only have a couple hours each day to play.  And the SCORE challenges have a time limit, the main quest line doesn't. 
---
I've got pretty good at knocking out the challenges, but it still takes time. And after 90 minutes I find I only have enough time to advance a quest one more stage before I'm done for the night.
---
that there are already people which have finished the legendary run....
---
My camp is actually a little village with three tiny houses. One in where I live with my bobble head and magazine stand, my bed and radio and stuff like that. The other one is rather big, two level building. There are all my crafting benches and the generator room, which is basically a generator balcony. And then there is the last one, my museum/vendor house. In the middle there are 2 vendors and on the outside there are weapon stands.
---
Nice. I got two in a row the other day and these are the only two I ever got...
---
I have almost all the plans (curse you Ultracite Tesla Coils!) and over 2k hours of play. I'm building my Wastelanders gear in preparation for the BoS stories coming up. When I have felt a lack of motivation in the past, I generally find one of my friends online and help them with their goals. That's worked everytime so far. 😁
---
Just repair weapon drops from mobs ot buy them from vendors. One uranium fever event will get you dozens of weapons and theres a weapon bench right next to it
---
There is no in game search. There's a recent tab that shows the people that you've recently been on a server with, but that's it. 
---
You have to type his name in and hit enter, and he has to do the same for you.
---
This is my fear aswell.
---
As a Daily kill 1 Legendary ? Thats doable with a Event.
---
As they said these Challanges should be conpleted with NORMAL Day to Day Gameplay.
---
Now its 3 - Which would translate to 3 Free Range Events basically or 2 Events and 1 Legendary Farm somewhere. ... thats kinda a 300% more effort since before.
---
This with these daily level ups are not even fun its more work then the last atom based dailys.
---
For Example
---
 -kill 10 mole miners
---
-cook 5 plant based food
---
-kill a deathclaw on deathclaw island
---
And earn 500 Caps is done in less than 30 mins.
---
But now kill 3 Legendarys / level up and use 6 stimpacks in NW takes 1 to 2 hours.
---
Im really afraid to see how these challanges look in the next few weeks.
---
Matt black one looks awful though....no offence :-)
---
I would rather creatures be at 3. 
---
Survive 30 mins I think should be 20 so it can be in 1 match. 
---
My biggest issues are:
---
Reviving teammates 2 times can be annoying unless you intentionally down each other. 
---
9 stimpacks?? That’s a bit excessive.
---
Looks a lot like the cult of Kosmos
---
hahahaha
---
I have the ghillie suit, just unlocked the HR ghillie camp yesterday, I just wish I could have a ghillie helmet with a light.
---
Tin foil hats spawn in the asylum appropriately enough
---
Yeah you have to be careful with it is rare even if they give me all of there fuel. The new ammo thing helps out as well as that the shishkebab also works
---
Do a FO4 survival mode playthrough.. Then come back and see if you want to pick it up again.
---
Yes the doubled it. Wtf...
---
We’ve had a lot of new players from the game pass on Xbox so I’ve been going up handing out weapons,stims,waters and power armour chassis with a few power cores to help out the new players and it was all well received and makes me feel good helping out, This is probably one of the best communities I’ve ever played in and I hope continues long into the future of this game
---
You have 100 levels over 70 days. If they were  any more challenging almost nobody would be able to complete.
---
I have the astronaut lady the trader guy near the overseers camp and the raider guy
---
Exactly. They really need a system in place asap, especially with the fear some casuals may have when future track levels take more effort than before.
---
It doesn't matter how "hard" or "easy" a quest is, difficulty is arbitrary depending on the person. But if you have to put in more effort as a player it should reward more. I fear stuff like this will push players away because the amount of effort necessary will increase with no change in the payoff.
---
Hope it helps, im trying to make a list of places ive found lead rich junk and hope to do a bit of a post as my friends i can play with always run dry often and i wander around heaps.
---
R u on xbox? Lemme help u get suited up if u are
---
I sniffed the pipe, for high af and then came back a while later and a Mr. Handy names “Mr. Squeeze” had a dope lemonade stand set up in the same spot... I love the pipe.
---
That’s a good idea I just have my bed in an alcove at the moment. I have tried to build up a floor with the same in mind but it just wouldn’t snap. I even jumped up there and removed most of the roof and tried from up there still no joy. Perhaps I should join a building team to try and get some knowledge. I’m not sure how they work though I don’t know if that means that they can start remodelling yours which I don’t want.
---
Yeah, I haven’t seen many people use a hunting rifle as their main.
---
No way man I just did the math that means he grinded the repeatable exp challenge 155 times everyday since the start your not gonna convince me that's legit
---
Cool, I hate how rain makes textures go to shit....about time they sorted that out :-)
---
One doesn't have to be a pathetic tryhard in order to reach level 700-800. A while back, there was a bug involving a trap that could give you infinite exp by just pressing a button and standing in one place. With RARE exceptions, i think anyone with that level is an exploiter, in my opinion.
---
Explore, and enjoy. Do the main story line's at your own pace.
---
I love it
---
Congrats! I made a post about my farm session today. I am happy with a gauss shotgun i got from settlers but for my PA heavy build I want the gauss minigun so badly. And actually I have no problem to do dailies for the crater. It is stupid but kinda fun. 
---
As for score I have no problem to do it as quick as possible. In order to lvl up just do xp farm West-Tek -&gt; Capitolium -&gt; Glassed Cavern. If there is nobody just switch server. And better go to lvl up in order to have some slots for legendary perks. I am pretty set up to have all of them + upgrade few perk cards but who knows what is next. 
---
cheers.
---
I think 100 per stat is normal.
---
How did you get this picture?
---
Kinda hard when you’ve been here since launch of the beta. All of my quest were basically done when i was level 90 because i was taking my time. Im only level 287 now because i go on and off. Its like the grind isn’t very catchy. Like with tera it’s different same with eso. Idk why i just can’t stay into fo76. I love the game don’t get me wrong but i almost want to cry when i realize the only thing i have to do is the same rinse and repeat pattern of do events, cranberry bog kill the scorchbeast that spawn there, do events, go grind ammo, do events, go back to the bog. Eventually i end up sitting at my base wanting to play that game but not having a clue on what to do. I launch nukes a lot but. Im just burnt out. I play the game like a zombie. At points i just wonder aimlessly around Appalachia with a power fist that isn’t even legendary killing things. I don’t even use melee weapons i just do it when im in zombie mode. I know i may get a lot of downvotes for this but how can someone take their time when they have already done most of the stuff while taking their time. Ive only soaked 897 hours within the game. That tells you how on and off i am. If i were a true vet those numbers would be higher. But i just can’t play a game with just air. I love the mechanics, the scraping, the grinding for food. Its all fun but feels very repetitive. I could go on and on but i know for a fact ill just repeat myself. I just can’t find the right words when it comes to what would and probably will be a great game. I love it i really do...but when i get in and try to have fun i find myself bored and i get sad. Because it feels so empty even after Wastelanders. Ive started over on sub characters so many times. I just can’t man. Great game but it feels empty still.
---
DIY Factions- yaass! Maybe if we start setting these up ourselves, Bethesda will get the idea that we're really interested in stuff like this.. oh yeah, nevermind.
---
This is very true. I like the game same as other people aswell (day 1 player here) but I feel like when I have 2 hours of playtime a day I maybe just be able to complete the challanges. But I really dont see myself play daily lots of hours just to do these challanges. I rather see myself  switch to a other game to enjoy 2 hours with and call it a day.
---
Bethesda obviously trys to slow down the score earning by players to force them to buy some steps with atoms / money = profit.
---
But slwoing down these rewards will drive away core players like myself - I like F76 .. I dont like it that I want to play it 4 hours a day straight just to complete these challanges.
---
Did you do their quests?
---
Also are you a pioneer scout? 
---
Did you do any of the Van lowe stuff?
---

I just recently met two of them at Whitesprings station. A lowlvl with a bounty and his highlvl friend. Constantly attacking me, they obviously wanted me to engage. I jetpacked up to the power poles and when they could'nt reach me anymore they hopped to another server. Dunno what it gives them.
---
(cue the trap camp.....)
---
Got it yesterday too! Not that I really wanted this specific reward, but 1/3 of the path is behind now (score-wise level 49 is 1/3 technically, but still).
---
Was not that hard to grind actually, about 400-450k xp per day, it took 3-4 hours a day on average.
---
What I found surprising is that before seasons I was barely getting a level per day. (I was in my early 400-s). And now it becomes pretty addictive gaining more and more every day. Right now I'm almost 493 and I project getting about 100 more levels by the time I'll finish season in two weeks at this pace.
---
Im not even sure why the cryolator is even in this game. Wasn't It a unique weapon that was developed inside vault 111?
---
If you force people to play the game every single day, espect only a few like you will be happy
---
Thos is why we need pa displays
---
Dude all i can say about this is...same
---
Challenges in adventure mode is ez, NW mode is nope sometimes, the creature hunting number need to scale down from 9 to 3 as a daily, time spent in finding creatures n exposed urself then next round for 250 score is ridiculous, I can easily earn that score in grinding
---
run away! 
---
just joking. better play with no tips on ur own. less spoilers = more fun. any mistake u do now will be compensated in the future. One tip i can suggest = dont sell free2take stuff for crazy prices. Players can remeber ur nickname and they will never ever visit ur camp for a trading purpose.
---
I absolutely love this! Excellent post! The design decisions of this game are so baffling. The limits create this constant grind that does indeed make the game feel like a second job. With the daily limits that grind everything to a screeching halt, the absurdity that is this game’s RNG, and the scarcity of real endgame content, it can feel like a chore to even play quite often. That should not be the case. Wastelanders showed some promise, but that story content was a good 20 hours at absolute best (though probably closer to 10-15 hours). It sometimes feels that the Bethesda wants to punish us for wanting to have fun in this game.
---
The 'challenges' are supposed to be easy, they will not make them harder. The whole point is to give you an incentive to log in every day.
---
Also if you want to boost your raider rep, go onto YouTube and search raider rep bug. You can get to max rep in a matter of hours if you have nothing better to do. Fuck the grind.
---
Im an antiarmor power armor build if that makes sense to you. Someone told me such a thing doesn’t exist and i was like that’s because i made it 😂
---
40mm grenade launcher should be able to assign any type of grenade to it as the ammo, and maybe give another 25% aoe.👍
---
Killing 3 legendary can finish in 1 event, stimpack used is not that hard, find the stimpack in some lockers n mailboxes, go to the fire n used them up, and yes it’s silly
---
That's the kind of eco-friendliness the wasteland could use. You're an environmental hero
---
I second this, guess it doesn’t really matter but still.
---
What are they doing
---
it is a lie. no one forces u to play the game every day. I ll tell u more. No one and nothing forces u to play the game unless u r utuber and this is ur job.
---
There’s a new dupe glitch going around that involves the vendors again.
---
I’m brazilian, and corona is here, aaaand I think it’s staying. 
---
I’m in lockdown since march 10th. and I guess I’ll stay here a while longer.
---
fuck these bats! to the silo, NOW!
---
Tbh even an aggro system would be nice . I mean who you you shoot the walking tank with a minigun or the guy plinking towards you with a pistol
---
I'd like to see 40mm flechettes and 40mm incendiary as mods for grenade launchers.
---
I have all of the locations discovered and i wish i can undiscover them so i can get that high for discovering them again.
---
Nice, whats affected?
---
I've run it idk how many times and havent gotten the outfit. Ive gotten 3 helmets, 2 backpacks and 2 flags. Any chance you know the drop rates for it all?
---
I did this in FO4. Collected all the sets and left them on show at a location. Had to lose a couple before figuring out to take the cores out. 
---
Wish we could do that in 76, but it would take up too much stash space, especially if there's a few skins you like for each type.
---
You could probably just have 1 perception and have glow sight. More damage to glowing creatures. Invest it into intelligence and get perks like battery included or a power armor one
---
Playstation needs a free play weekend of some sort ... mainly so we can offload all the hoarded plans, armour, ammo and weapons to the newbies so we can get our stash levels healthy again lol .
---
I do agree entirely with OP as I’ve had countless encounters with very kind individuals and always try to take note of there name in case I bump into them again to repay the kindness but more often than not a low level or someone who empty’s my vendors or hanging around my camp as I’m near Vault 76 usually gets a lot of loot I’m not in need of .
---
Didn’t launch my own nuke till i was level 127. Though i helped others do their i never manually did it.
---
Not sure but I heard people are trying to dupe legacy’s so they can have multiple of the same god rolled versions
---
I just reached lv 20... Bethesda keeps stealing my daily score from me...
---
Because it keeps the queen on the ground longer
---
What exactly are you complaining about here? Getting free stuff?
---
I 100% agree, this Event where you be a caravan guard reminds me of being a mercenary back in New Vegas. The waves after waves of tough enemies, a guaranteed legendary enemy usually at three stars every time, A neat little scavenger hunt that isn’t too hard, getting paid with a pepperoni roll every time. It’s an awesome event. 
---
(And the Brahmin can take a hit unlike every single other escort target in this game.)
---
I mean it shouldn't exist in the fallout universe yet.
---
It worked! I played for some hours without any problems.
---
Yup, hiding rewards behind a seasson it's a nice move. Not everyone have the time to play every day. People have more things to do than repairing 10 weapons, and there is a lot of bugs that needs Bethesda attention, but instead of that, they keep moneticing the game so they can milk people like you. Yes, everything it's alright. F76 Goty 😉
---
Majority of their players are not cheating. 
---
Learn to live with consequences of your actions.
---
Your gonna need loads of ammo. Pick any and all of it up!
---
Make it.
---
i believe it was Plato who said 'Play with fire and you're gonna get burned'

I wouldn’t mind if i could store infinite junk without having to pay for infinite storage.
---
PC market is a funny biscuit. Pre-Covid I used to sell them and robot collectables for common 55C and and uncommon for 100. They always sold ridiculously fast. Now it's around 22C for bears and 50C for bot collectables.
---
Or hes just done with the game now that its become another job
---
Especially Mole Rats!
---
I don't know about all that but I usually place my camp build it and then move the camp device around until I get to spawn point where I want it
---
\&gt; **Can't believe Beth is prepared to ban the majority of their dedicated player base.** 
---
But you're either duping and/or have duped items, if you find perfect items or vast quantities of items randomly lying about, you know that shit ain't legit. If you pick it up, you kinda deserve it
---
Level 60 legendaries? Did I missed something?
---
I think it's more of a shits and giggles thing rather than a lore aspect. You'll find no references to the Cryolater in any holotapes/terminals/voice dialogue.
---
*Radiation rumble has entered the chat*
---
I'm not complaining about the results. Do the crime do the time. Just giving a warning. You guys sure are very eager to punish. I believe Neitzsche said people eager to punish were of a low stock.
---
I've given up on being a weapon trader and left the market sub because of the duping.
---
It's ruined my endgame. Now I'm just buying junk from robot vendors to fill my scrapbox.
---
Or 4/5* ones.
---
With the most recent dupe I do not believe so.
---
I don’t take offense to your bad taste. Shadow Prime is awesome... so is Blackbird X01.
---
Good ban away. Sick of cheaters in this game.
---
That would be awesome but make it too easy for us, so I doubt they would ever do it. Really, shouldn't we be able to grow any plant we harvest in the wild?Thanks for nothing  BSG!
---
I was thinking the exact same thing earlier. 4* with double primary as a bonus would be good.
---
No. After my daily quests are finished, I like teaming up, exploring some more, doing public events, helping low level players, making new friends, taking over workshops, launching a nuke (can do it in about 10 minutes) and so on.
---
I would pay for it.
---
It was on a server that must have been near reset, because there were naked and t-posed/invincible enemies everywhere. This guy was swimming in the floor and when I killed him he danced into the air and froze like that. Then, it was just a matter of caaaaarefully placing my rifle for hilarity.
---
says you're offline
---
I’ve yet to do the Wastelanders story, and a few quests like the excavator armor and whatnot after 1600 hours playing 76. Dunno why, just haven’t gotten to it. Hell I was level 200 (Currently 337.) when I finally got around to doing the main quest a month before wastelanders about 1200 hours in. I just kinda wander around and do random shite, so I’ve got plenty to do.
---
aim for the thruster
---
At least you didn't grind out the whole 100 ranks in a couple of weeks without god mode or anything. The guy didn't sleep in a few days
---
Don’t start a pub team if you’re going to kick people to let others in. Just start your own private team with your friends
---
I have a small brick house with an attached garage that says *workshop* over it in the big neon. The house itself is still locked, due to all the bugs where people steal your stuff. I also have a teeny tiny lemonade stand by the road with the billboard that has *shop* in neon letters along with a weapons/item list and prices.  My vendors are here. You spawn right in front of it. Small letters over the machines say *workbench in the garage* I also have the small letters saying *vending machines to the south* over the workbenches.
---
The noobs have been swarming out of the vault, and its great
---
Are you joking?   
---
If they're not meant to ban cheaters, who *are* they meant to ban?   
---
The ego on this one.
---
If they had played less, you'd say they hadn't given it enough of a chance.
---
Sure it's improved, it could hardly get worse. Game's still more broken than many EA games I've played, but I'm accustomed to broken and can enjoy it in spite of that. Doesn't mean it's a good game, doesn't mean I can recommend it in good faith. Bethesda doesn't get props for basic, due diligence support for an online game following blatantly, extensively negligent development, launch, and marketing practices. They get to not be sued and bear a huge black mark going into the release of TES.
---
Had no idea you could hear the flies. Thanks for that, guess I need to my music down and effects up. Learn something new everyday.
---
the 8 star level 60 Quad ultracite explosive two-shot instigating gauss Rolling Pin.... 
---
its supposed but not necessary. the only days I will play hard when they do x2 for xp. Right now i farm scrips and rep and still can manage lvl me up 5 times for a game session. if i go for xp farm there will be up tp 10 lvl ups/per day. since the start of the marathon i gained 70 lvls  from 180 up to 250. mostly farming on events (guess u know ´em)
---
thnks for suggestion but keep an eye. it is agains the rules to suggest this thing. anyway i try to play fair as it possible in this buggy madness.
---
Oh yea i loved Oblivion waaaay more compared to skyrim and the Shivering isle is the reason why. Also the oblivion gates to.
---
and?

Whats your gt and ill inv you

He already hit level 100.

---
Thankyou
---
Starting to feel like a chore. Starting. XDDDDDDDDDDD
---
And stay away from groups of them unless you are wearing Troubleshooter armor.
---
The problem with that thinking is that not everyone is on reddit etc, so may not be aware that such an exploit exists. 
---
Which is why Bethesda won't be able to do sweeping bans on anyone with a duped item. There will be totally innocent players that just stumbled into a station vendor and found a god roll weapon on sale, or someone giving them away.
---
It will most likely be pretty obvious server side who carried out the actual dupe though.
---
I mean, it could easily be a feature added to fallout shelter. 
---
“Your” shelter appears on your in game map and you can drop by to pickup dockets of items, like the dying light companion app.
---
But you wont get the bonuses...
---
That would be a great effect for those pearly binoculars you can find. Right now they are pretty much worthless.
---
That’s all well and good but can you post a picture of full ghillie set you’re talking about instead of this picture with nothing but grass in it?
---
Just warning people to stay away from duped items.... People hacking NW perhaps? Or worrying about fixing the exploit instead of banning people. I'm not defending duping. But i have tonnes of friends on fo76 and almost all of them have benefited from the dupewave and each of them has more friends and those more, if they all get banned there will be almost no one left.
---
I couldn't give a shit anymore about the rules. The grind is wank, boring and unimaginative.
---
Do yourself a favour and get that max rep out the way, youll still have to grind the settlers honestly as there's no exploit for them.
---
Thatd be cool.
---
Looks like someone wants to get their ass kicked
---
YOU ARE not WRONG. 
---
I recently started trying to solo the event but you really need a team other wise it’s great XP and great rewards!
---
Ah. Trevor Phillips has made it to West Virginia it seems
---
I quit the online after the game pass players. I will note though, 76 is still my favorite online game
---
I doubt the settlement limit is the big reason.
---
Perfect explanation thank you
---
Thank goodness...I thought I was going crazy.
---
I can see Kent's station not being a thing, but the Silver Shroud was a radio show - my impression was that he had some old recordings. I don't think it would be too surprising for other copies to exist, especially given that there are some Mistress items in 76.
---
Complete nonsense. They do not ban or suspend people for using duped items. Otherwise majority of the players in this game would have been banned already. If you got suspended or banned, then **you have been duping or assisting with duping**. Don't spread misinformation just because you got burned.
---
I'm closing in for sure. Not as serious as you, clearly but mostly sticking to a single alt, that being my high int one ... and mostly as I want to level her up.
---
She also has her camp be a graveyard, and i need more horrible things for it. Aiming for that tree.
---
He's min/max'ing his time vs efficiency, nothing at all wrong with that.
---
The entire point of RPG's and MMO's is to min2max, be the best you can be.
---
If he wants to speed run an level up, let him. It's his choice to do so.
---
Don't complain because you don't/can't do the same.
---
My daughter and I got our first pieces on the same day. Me in 76 and she in Fallout 4.
---
rammadeus
---
Mr Gutsy with ballistic is real PITA in the game, I saw 3 of them take down a legendary SB
---
\&gt; suspended for having duped items
---
this part here lost me, while the dupers should be banned (said as a 76 "poor," who would of benifited from the price drop) i have serious doubts they would punish for owning one,  the market/economy is currently boned (will recover) and they have been traded on a semi-massive scale
---
this would of also been the first time they punished for touching said item(s),  they didnt ban/suspend anyone simply for "having one" in any of the past dupe, including the SH dupe, TSE dupe, or vendor dupe.  otherwise pretty much anyone who ever touched a tse weapon would be at risk of suspension due to how widespread that one was.
---
You can get them from machines but just a low chance roll I guess. I've had maybe 2 in 130 odd levels.
---
Auto completing happens, you don't get the score!
---
I use three guns 
---
A pipe rifle that uses .38
---
A combat rifle that uses .45
---
A handmade that uses 5.56
---
My best gun is the handmade so when I begin to run low on 5.56 ammo I use the other guns for a bit till I collect more 5.56 ammo usually from super mutants.
---
But the most ammo in the shortest amount of time  will be from making it. But dont make any till you have ammosmith and superduper perks maxed out to get the mist out of the lead and gunpowder you collect.
---
Extra crispy
---
I like them the way they are. Gutsy's and assaultrons keep you on your toes.  Not much else in this game will do that. Even then all you really have to do is put something between them and you.
---
I've seen that myself at someone's camp. It's creepy and it makes me wonder about the person that wants to roll play that kind of thing.
---
Only unemployed folk can get past half of the Legendary Run without paying it seems
---
Nope the duping has ruined any rarity in this game. Until they do a full inv wipe of all items the game is going to be like this
---
No, I'm at level 50.  The tree was my goal so I stopped grinding when I reached it
---
they are more scarier than those assaultron  mfs
---
TBH use stimpack is not difficult at all, creature hunt is. But I think I agree with u, if the NW daily challenge get harder n harder with same 250 score I will rather spend my time grinding in adventure, few events can earn more score than the challenge
---
Nothing to do with player vendors. People are using robot vendors at trainstations.
---
\&gt; Which is why Bethesda won't be able to do sweeping bans on anyone with a  duped item. There will be totally innocent players that just stumbled  into a station vendor and found a god roll weapon on sale, or someone  giving them away. 
---
i cant speak for other systems, but it also can easily get innocent people banned because of xbox LFG,  people constantly put stuff up for sale on there with no other info, so they could buy that b2525 fixer that was duped thinking they got the deal of a lifetime,  turns out it was just a dupe wave.   now your punishing said player because they are not a reddit member
---
I see no issue with people complaining about the issues the game does have.
---
When I played ESO I complained about the issues that game had.   
---
But eventually I stopped complaining about the different issues, then stopped caring...then stopped playing.
---
Stims were way easier than creatures
---
So what would it take for me to get one, I’ve always wanted one
---
Well, I must've missed where he mentioned it.
---
Oh ok thanks for the heads up
---
It's the dupers that ruin this game.
---
Few days ago a duper asked, how to get rid of his duped stimpacks easily, in this sub. I said, that I may have a solution, so what's your gamertag and he sent it to me in reddit's chat(not very bright fellow I guess). So I reported him to Beth and felt pretty good. I know they won't probably do anything, but still.
---
More difficult ... I dont think so.  
---
More time consuming, yes.
---
How many dupes you got?
---
Yeah...this was a big letdown. Not sure why that wasn't included
---
I've wanted to do something similar but haven't moved my camp yet to do so. I hear about this problem often enough that I've tried to come up with a solution. I figure, since vending machines don't need to be powered to sell items, why not setup somewhere along the way from 76 to wayward?
---
Enough along the beaten path so that a new player is bound to come across the camp but not powered up so everyone else on the map can see your camp.
---
I haven't tried it yet so I don't know how effective it might be but maybe worth a shot lol
---
Lets just hope we're done taking pictures of people wearing atom shop clothing on the top of seneca rocks in a nuke zone.
---
Turn your unwanted ammo into 5.56 with ammo converter. And yes, it really painful to do, I know because I still have 1.8 million of 5mm awaiting to convert.
---
I‘m toying around with the same idea lately. 
---
Saved some legendary weapons, digged a bit into perks for support as crits.
---
Looks pretty solid on paper but I don’t expect it to be much useful in the game in its current state.
---
I've never seeb it there either. Are you suuuuuurrrrreeeee it is sold at whitespring?
---
How does this get released on xbox game pass without them testing it on a secondary drive? Absolute morons.
---
Not necessarily, there are some plants and fungi that are so sensitive they can still only be collected in the wild. Like the huckleberries or truffles.
---
5 second rule
---
In the inside the vault they said the challenges would start off taking about an hour to do and build closer to two hours by the end.
---
This sub lol, downvotes for expressing an opinion :-)
---
Looks bulbous..
---
If we all liked the same thing life would be pretty boring folks :-)
---
I agree Blackbird is cool, I rock Blackbird X01 myself
---
Well, thats how bethesda makes things more difficult to be fair
---
Bethesda just figured if you have a job, you should be giving them your money to get the skins...🤷‍♂️
---
Flamethrowers also need to work like this!
---
Make a blueprint for the single item and place the blueprint. All those times you place an object normally and it ends up on another level or its green but says it lacks support or whatnot. Blueprint let's you get around 90% of those issues in my experience ;)
---
This last bs has me stopped playing all together. 
---
When I realised you couldn't even complete the board if you did every single task every day I thought what's the bloody point.
---
It's just as much of a boring grind as every other thing they've brought out. Fast travel - do shit task - fast travel back for very little of anything.
---
I'm seriously considering changing my screen name fallouts just a disappointment now.
---
i have arrows leading to mine and it’s all light up and out in the open but people still manage to miss it
---
The option is available on PC, can't speak for other platforms.
---
Oh my bad yes you’re right it’s the robot vendors.
---
Well i assume 2 brahmin alive = better rewards. but i don't know. I've just done free range and one died at the end and i noticed no difference in the rewards.
---
The more supplies = more rewards got debunked. it just effects the caps reward
---
Your the man!!!:)
---
Didn't even think of that - of course! You guys must be getting a huge influx of newbies. Reading the comments, I'm so happy to hear of other people also helping out the low-level players.
---
What do U mean? Like from a player or drops?
---
As a professional bush wookie and lake diver, I'm happy to share some thoughts if you like on how to maximize your returns. I do about half the challenges for NW and genenerally place well with limited actual player interactions.
---
I hope they put a nav marker on them.
---
From a player, dropping is too hard imo
---
You should know where their bodies are🤦‍♂️
---
I'd be really pissed by that.
---
I wont profess to have done the math at all as I really don't care enough, I think the takeaway is that while it is actually possible, you would be doing nothing but playing all your waking hours. Hence why the information comes from a streamer who did just this.
---
I will say though that I make a good 5 levels without trying when I play even if challenges are already done. INT team, unyielding armour, squirrel stew and carnivore, mags id bought and stockpiled to sell on at a profit. The XP repeatable is actually pretty easy to spam. 
---
For a casual player id say where I am is quite realistic at the first junction point. The only two things I really wanted was the ammo station and the ghillie sniper so I'm pretty much done already. Im pretty sure if I was on lockdown again when this score system is in place I could be quite close by now to 100 (my wifes a nurse so before I went back to work i was alone pretty much all day in lockdown)
---
Thanks. I'll put some of the stuff to good use. I spend a lot of my play time helping people out. I gave away like 70 herd serums when teams came out.
---
The gates were one of my fav parts of the game, I used to be so scared going into them hahah
---
I mean if people don’t agree with it yes they down vote, what do you think the downvote button is for?
---
TSDR
---
I dont get it. What exactly make u think that they milk me? I gathered 10 random useless weapon and it didnt cost me a lot. if u really do well one event and go to collect everything in order to scrap it u will be surprise, amigo. 
---
If u dont have time to play this game, dont play the game. what is the problem? If i dont like the taste i would never consume the product. It is very simple.
---
&gt;In the inside the vault they said the \~\~challenges\~\~ tiers would start off taking about an hour to do and build closer to two hours by the end.

FTFY
---
Like or dislike the comment, not agree or disagree.
---
I can appreciate someone's passion with an up vote without agreeing with it :-)
---
I have found in a laggy server if you have targeting HUD on sometimes the red glow stays on a body for quite some time. Dont use PA often but when I do i always have targeting HUD on as its like 300c at the whitespring bunker so worth the buy. 
---
Doesnt work with goo piles or meat piles though ime.

"Duping is bad" 
---
"Yeah but they just duped a bunch of B2525 Fixers.."
---
"Can I have one?"
---
All good, we've all been there before.
---
I agree.Never understood all the attractiveness of full black for some people. You're not solid snake or a vampire.
---
Try to decide what kind of build you’ll want, early on.
---
I like sleeping on roofs, much more fun than Bush camping!
---
I always carry a complete set of Troubleshooter; all modded to be ultralight, (except dense torso), and change into it for Encryptid, silos, AWOL, and Dyer Chemical.
---
Player vendors often sell it for scrip prices, so can be pretty cheap to acquire.
---
Combine with a vampire weapon, you can tank these events/locations.
---
I don’t dupe, if they are doing an inventory wipe I’d like to try one, may as well before I get everything I’ve got taken away from me anyway
---
All quests marked as "Daily" will provide you with scrip. Ones that are "Repeatable" don't.
---
This is frustrating. 
---
Be careful if you are bloodied as sometimes their animations and attacks will follow you around invisibly. This was actually what was happening when the invisible damage bug was being reported. Somewhere close you'd find a headless or static ghoul, sometimes floating in the sky in a t pose like da vincis virtruvian man.
---
I did the mystery quest early on that someone else recommended it gives you a decent blade, gun and the garb of mysteries which gives you ok sneaking abilities. You get it off a dead lady wearing the veil of secrets but I can’t remember where she spawned now. I’m sure if you googled it you could find out more
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually.
---
(Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps.
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered).
---
You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies.
---
Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away.
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod.
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds.
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
already did with settlers in the fucking honest way. I have 700+ hours in game so if i got a ticket i will never ever play bethesda´s games and i have been playing them since 2003.

Nothing at the link. I don't think you can link people to support tickets.
---
Thanks. I don't have much time during the week with work family and sleep needs... hopefully I can check it out today. Might be awhile if I can't. I have been sticking to just cranberry relish and brain fungus soup so far. Still hitba lvl up in 30min at 309 which is way faster than before. 534xp per super mutant.
---
A flame core?  More cores!!
---
Yes it does.
---
The reload animation is already fitting a tank of fuel, it just makes sense!
---
Seems that Fallout 76 is a just a reflection of our real world.
---
Yes I did a quick check on ebay. The famous fixer went from 300  to 9 dollars. And the rest should follow as you are pretty much guaranteed the seller will just dupe before selling you.
---
TL;DR
---
I remember this a couple patch's ago I glitched beyond the boarder with the survival tent and found roads, paths and shacks with loot.
---
I'm just now realising how weird it is that the game doesn't have any kind of robes.
---
Oh, goodie. You're back -.-
---
🤫
---
Why do you find vendors in Fallout 4 selling cryolator ammo after you pick it up? Seems kinda weird they sell ammo for a gun that’s the only one if it’s kind in existence...
---
I just try not to think too hard about stuff like that, “ha ha Cryolator go BRRRR.”
---
I primed my bloodied handmade, and mostly use a fixer, radium or Tesla. Handmade only comes out for really big things. 
---
The others handle everything fine in a single shot or burst. Big things may take a sustained burst or several.
---
Can confirm that it does.
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually.

Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Follow quests and mostly, enjoy the vibe :\]
---
It’s also the option that pisses the least amount of people off. Because actually harder would probably make some challenges impossible for lower level players. 
---
Someone suggested a challenge of blowing up 100 cars. Which is love! So now I’m trying to think of other challenges like that. Maybe jump run the pioneer race on the bridge without getting hit by any of the creatures on the bridge?
---
Maybe its proof that the next fallout will involve timetravel
---
Wow the irony lol. Look at your comments in the last 3 days. 
---
Lol.
---
Would be cool if they tied it in with the Mistress of Mysteries questline. You could find a crate of her memorabilia, then you could have an awesome new quest to got meet Julie, our lovely new DJ, and ask her to help setup playbacks of the show on a new station. That would be really cool.
---
Figure out a build before spending points on your character because the respec system is bullshit.
---
Don´t spend too much time and resources building workshops after you claim them because you lose progress if your game crashes (get use to your game crashing) or you leave the server. Unless is a private world from fallout 1st.
---
99% of plans and recipes can be found in player vendor for 1/10 or less of the price of NPC vendors. Always check player vendor in camps.
---
Use the public team system, building team gives more XP overall because of the INT bonus. If you are teamed equip the inspirational perk to level up faster (if that is you thing).
---
Most players have nothing to spend resources on after a month or two playing so interact with people.
---
I totally agree, something needs to be an actual challenge in the game, otherwise what's the point.
---
TOASTY!
---
You dont need squad maneuver or hard bargain ... mutations and gear will make them pointless. Put those into the 3 first rank damage cards. Find one more point and put into concentrated fire, it is handy.
---
Home defense is junk to slot. Find something else.
---
That would be great! I'm still hovering at around 600/800 in my stash at the moment, but it's definitely creeping up there... 
---
I'm so glad you've had a similar experience!
---
Soo if i manage to see a bunch of high levels around a vendor is there any way to intervene and get one myself. Like could i nuke mine them or something and buy one out of the ve dor
---
Not much
---
Yes!!
---
But you still have no cake!  It’s a lie.
---
I don’t think we know what happens. My hope is they would return to atom challenges for those couple weeks (assuming there is a pause)
---
I think they're trying to correct you. The challenges won't take longer, but levelling up will (more score per level up).
---
All I'm saying is how shitty it is that people dupe anything. I work hard for my shit, love it when I get something rare. Exploiting the game is just insulting to the rest of us.
---
All theyre doing is selling the legendarynto the vendor . And having a frind buy when they leave. Using a glitch so it stays jn their I nventor and the vendors. 
---
So jn theory you could sneak up and just buy itnout from under them for caps
---
You actually can complete the board by just doing every daily and weekly challenge...
---
Right? Especially since we know some comics came with holotapes.
---
Thanks I liked to shotgun and the gauss minigun but A Brotherhood Minigun a Guass Rifle and a Fatman is all I need.
---
The XP Farm takes still around 1 Hour for me (non Unyielding Build) - Also totally not excited for Legendary Perks, there is close to none synergy with Power Armor.
---
Take any melee weapon, kill 5 enemies preferably near a weapons workbench.  Repair the weapon.  Repeat.  
---
Whitesprings works well for this.
---
Pick if your going to be a : Heavy guns, vats rifleman, vats AutoRifles, or melee build and specialize your perk cards to that optimized build. Do not do the wishy-washy "I'm a max carry weight shotgun build and I always have all of my crafting perks active even when I'm trying to shoot the queen with my shotgun build." You will struggle in the late game and will be forced to reassign your special perks to make your character salvageable. Avoid paying for legendaries at full cost that have: nocturnal, suppressors, troubleshooters, hunters, exterminators, mutant slayers, they are sub par. Good primary perks are bloodied, junkies, furious, executioner's, quad, anti armor and sometimes zealots if it's a queen killing weapon. Happy hunting!
---
Heh yeah,
---
But to be fair I let these pass anyway and still managed to get lots of ATOMS for the Challanges.
---
I work 60ish hours a week. 2 kids. Already at level 30
---
Can't see how the math doesn't work for 10wks.
---
That would be the best solution by far. Apply a anti-cheat system to detect duping (like most online game have had for 15 years) and up the max level of all items by 10-20 levels. This would ofc require increase in game difficulty aswell. Which, i think most of you would agree, is well overdue..
---
Why a PM? Why not here if it’s legit?
---
Felt like this a week into wastlanders. The game is quite shit to be brutally honest.
---
That's nothing, I saw a Scorched Scorched Scorched Conqueror.
---
That’s my hope as well. 
---
I think there has to be a pause, really. They said each season takes ten weeks, and four seasons each year. That’s 12 weeks leftover.
---
You don't get a bonus that way unfortunately.
---
Ye, range of team heal is pathetic so my plan is out...
---
Perhaps you have the luxury of being able to play every day, missing out on a weeks worth of challenges every other week sets one back a lot
---
Usually happens when a server starts crapping out due to lag. You get diseased robots etc
---
Duchess doesn't tell you she's an arms dealer who sells drugs on the side. You have to figure these things out for yourself.
---
I believe it's just a repeatable quest I've done it s few times a day before
---
It's not meant to be resetting like that, but these kinda things happens in this game. It just works!
---
You're better doing heart of the enemy, it's 8 scrip instead of 3. Go to the terminal on the fourth floor of the asylum and use the terminal in the power armor room. It doesn't require logging out either.
---
There is at least two. "Take one for the team" and "Blood sacrifice"
---
Yes but it's like a job that only gives you enough salary to cover the commute costs. Do you get the paradox?
---
Id be pikachu face for a month because beth never does anything smart so this would be a first, this is the 10th dupe and nothing gets done so i doubt that changes
---
I guess people never heard of subspace
---
I’m getting 8 scripts for this one aswell
---
If you’re on XBox, let me know what you need. I’d be glad to craft you a solid set of well-modded gear and weapon along with a solid amount of ammo. 
---
If you’re ready for mutations, I’ve got some free serums as well just make sure you’re running Starched Genes 2.
---
Cry some more please
---
I can solo it myself but can only keep one animal alive so I don’t get good rewards
---
Simple. If you add up number of score received from daily and weekly challenges it exceeds total score. If you are citing that old post that got a lot of upvotes the math was flawed. 
---
1) total score was off by about 3700 because it incorrectly had you earning score for 100 levels not 99 (level 1 is free)
---
2) it didn’t take into account double score weekend which adds 8000 potential score to be earned from challenges. 
---
All in all if you do all daily and weekly challenges you will end up with almost 3000 score above and beyond the score needed for levels 2-100.
---
Talk to ppl, chances are if your not a dick, you’ll be able to make some higher lvl friends that can help you with tedious tasks like repairing armor and random junk you need. That being said, don’t cheat yourself out of the learning the game by ppl giving you everything you need. I’ve been seeing a lot of high lvl players lately that have no clue of how to actually play the game because all they’ve done is power lvl with there experienced friends and they miss out on 1/2 the game.
---
I hope you get banned lmfao fucking cheating scum
---
It's 8 weeks away, even patch 21 which is expected soon is still essentially rumours and supposition. I hope atoms return as I've not spent any recently as they are so hard/expensive to replace now without a trickle feed during normal play (i hardly count the 150 per 10 ranks) but I wouldn't be surprised if its not and ends up mixed rewards, or even just caps.
---
Is that the one that requires DNA? If it is thats still broken for me.
---
Mine is surrounded by flashing lights and has a chair in front of the vendor.
---
Online retailers like myself understand the value of your, uh, demographic.
---
Veteran Players like myself can get these done but its about 
---
A 
---
the Curve -first 1 Legendary now 3 ? In 2 Weeks 6?
---
B
---
Newer Players cant jump into these challanges. They Lack the Knowledge and Gear to complete them.
---
I think these Challanges shouldnt be: Oh let me run West Tek to complete this Task but rather kill 50 enemies for example.
---
Lol imagine beth doing something other then try to make money of us id take a free ban if it ment this game gets out of the shitter
---
Don’t feel bad.
---
I’m actually not able to play today. 
---
And not everyone is going to be able to complete the board. It’s supposed to be an achievement, not a participation trophy.
---
Double xp will put you on the right track with spare.if you play it.
---
You know I'm done with this sub anyway. Too many little bitches.
---
I dont mind assaultrons I can just rush them and melee them before they do anything most of the time.
---
Gutsy on the other hand blows out my kneecaps before I get to them almost every time.
---
This is an awesome location, thank you!
---
Too bad the sentry droids aren't like this
---
Kill super mutants! Kill, kill, kill!
---
in a real business you keep the 10%, it ain't so bad
---
Yes works for throwables grenades also.
---
I’ve played probably 1500 hours of F4 and still haven’t beat the main quest line.
---
If you bothered to go get that level you're a tryhard
---
I’d stare at it too. It’s a nice looking tree.
---
got to do it 3 times earlier this week a as well. don't think its supposed to, but hey script
---
Oh cool so now I just have to give up my job, my children and my sex life to complete it 🤣
---
Nah the grinds not worth it.
---
Update: Indeed we have to do this each time. I’ll probably just write a script for now.
---
That’s the only place I’ve ever gotten one. If someone didn’t post a vid of getting one from a machine I still wouldn’t believe it could happen.
---
I get that items on display count for stash weight. I don't like it, but it is what it is.
---
Now imagine if they counted my concrete foundation, steel walls, and workbenches "on display" towards my stash weight 😂
---
Just a suggestion to how bethesda should fix the broken amount of duped weapons
---
I mean...it really wouldn't affect anything. Atleast in terms of Bloodied weapons. For a long while I was using a Bloodied CR that 20 or 25, and it still would shred through SBs and LVL 68 Super Mutants.
---
Yea people would want the Max Level stuff, but gameplay wise it wouldn't affect anything major.
---
How much space do those use in your stash? Jeez!
---
I'm a stealth sniper player so neither the gauss shotgun nor the gauss minigun are apealing to me
---
Lol Okay...?
---
I have a friendly porch with a vendor surrounded by crafting machines, but my real camp is underground for secret watching
---
It was sold as an open world rpg, unfortunately it is not, its a second rate looter/shooter. If you want to keep you loot you must pay the monthly subscription. I would like to see more quest lines like the "mistress of mystery", it had plot and characters with a clear set of interconnected quests and logical progression. All the recent updates have simply added more grind, its regrettable but there is nothing the players can do its all on the developers.
---
I do this every few months to purge my stash of items. (All junk is in fo1st stash box)
---
If I didn’t see a video someone posted I wouldn’t believe it either.
---
Or.. and hear me out.
---
You do the dailies and get everything eventually.
---
my camp is AWESOME.  it’s designed as a home and looks really cool, I put a lot of design creativity into it and it’s now perfected
---
Don’t grind it  you don’t need to complete it. 
---
I doubt I will be able to complete it.  I might get close though. Don’t think I need to get rid of my kids, wife or job though. 
---
I’m not able to play at all today. But I think I’m still in a good position.
---
For me as a new player who likes to build (I spent a looooot of time in fo4 settlement building), I just like to go in and see what items people have used and how they built their camp. If someone wants to lock their camp that's fine, but it's kind of fun to be nosey. XD
---
It’s a second wave!!
---
If they banned all dupers the game would die from lack of users rofl
---

---
You're preaching to the choir there, bud. I freaking HATE the Mr Gutsys that spawn at events in The Cranberry Bog, usually open ground with limited cover those suckers get me at least once per event and the range of their freaking weapons is insane. Not to mention the "punch" they give you now if you just happen to be in the line of sight of one. I'd take on a horde of Assaultrons over having to deal with 2 high level Mr Gutsys.
---
Lol “too hard”
---
Well you've already gotten 30 participation trophies from it haven't you? I don't expect everyone to finish it but with only 10 weeks its pretty tight even if you're able to get on almost every day
---
Calm down Bethesda just wants everyone to use godmode glitch lvling lmao
---
This happens a lot! Yesterday, I tried gifting a lvl 10 a full set of pa with t-60 parts in it. Even with some cores and 25+stims etc. It took me 15 minutes to emote him that I come in peace. :( I know they were high level but he dropped all the parts and took only the chassis. I mean, you can sell them if you can’t yet use them. Just take the damn gifts!! Please don’t make me carry my junk back home.....
---
Kill 5 wanted players.
---
u can be thankful for that dupe , otherwise this game is RNG in every possible way, even during 500hours of gameplay u wont obtain gun like that
---
Loot them off enemies. Ive got 11 INT and I still find broken stuff.
---
No. It's a mutation. Most mutations are really game changers.
---
Wait you can only level up once a day?
---
Where on earth did they get a pristine MrFuzzy head from o.O
---
You mean lets add even more OP weapons to the game? It's already too easy if you run a meta build. 
---
That said. If they lifted the end game levels for NPC mobs, I'd be down with that. Plenty of MMO's have level increases, prestige classes, championship points etc. If they introduced a level cap increase and harder enemies with a story expansion I'd be happy. 
---
I suspect those with lots of rare high end stuff probably wouldn't be happy though.
---
Good points! Though they haven't 100% transitioned to mining the existing user base - there was a very deliberate effort to use Wastelanders as the "see, it's good now!" moment, which they coincided with bringing to Steam (and, I suspect, by doing a bunch of advertising - got spammed with Youtube ads around that time). And now they've brought the game to XBox Game Pass, which is going to bring in a bunch of new people - though we'll see how many of them actually land up buying the game at some point.
---
No, unless you re-place from your PIP boy.
---
Moving your CAMP device does move the spawn position, but it's not 100% consistent. If you stay in one place for a while you'll find 1-3 spots, all nearby, that fast travelers will drop into.
---
I try to place mine near the edge of the camp radius or an exterior wall so that people spawn into a safe, public spot.
---
Wow thats awesome
---
Do you know what a participation trophy is?
---
I wasnt talking about the challenges. I meant basically in all their games just makes enemys tanky and call them difficult. Yes, i agree in that they cant make these challenges difficult in that sence. Something like you are suggesting would be fun actually
---
According to Steam Achievements I also haven’t left the fucking Vault yet lol
---
Switching from Beth launcher to steam is kinda weird that way.
---
Yeah, those are more active and reactionary. I'm thinking about perks similar to how passive charisma perks work now.
---
It would just be nice to see something that felt legendary in a way that affects the entire team. Especially if those perks had synergy with one another, further enhancing team play.
---
Break down your junk into scrap at workstations.
---
Store that scrap in your stash box. 
---
Sell unused weapons and armors to vendors.  You can earn up to 1400 caps daily *(every 20 hours technically)* from sales to merchants/vendors. They all share the same cap pool, so don’t worry about running around finding 7 different vendors.
---
If you have leftover gear, breakdown the armor and weapons you will not be using into scrap at workstations.
---
Use [this website](https://nukesdragons.com) to plan out your build. If you’d like, post a description of what you’d like your character to be able to do and be good at, and what type of weapons you’d want to use in combat. I’d be glad to design a basic build for you. 
---
For your low levels, use melee as much as possible. Conserve your ammo for when you need it. 
---
Learn your favorites wheel function. Make sure you have 2-3 weapons assigned, so when one breaks you can quickly get to your backup. 
---
In the map/settings menu, there is a help guide. Take some time to read through that.  Also, under ‘game’ **turn Pacifist ON**. 
---
That’s off the top of my head. There are lots of good beginners guides out there, though.
---
id like to see lvl 99 super mutants and, from time to time, a lvl 121 glowing deathclaw. i run a mediocre build (inst combat rifle, non junkie, full health, far far away from the possible max) and still onehit nearly every enemy. more higher level baddies would be very nice.
---
Take your time. There’s a lot of great adventures in the Forest, that a a blast when you are low level.
---
Don’t rush the main quest.
---
Typical of recovering addicts. Buzzkill.
---
During the order of mysteries quest line you can read terminals of shannon's husband, and there is conversation between him and kent connely so he was alive prewar
---
And then there's folks who rather start their own one-person building team instead of joining the already existing team with only two members...
---
If anyone finds a holotape let me know.
---
Well thats a difficult one!
---
If you’re new I always recommend enjoying the sights, the world in this game is beaus d you can really get lost in it. The game does get grindy once you beat the main story but don’t let that ruin the good things about this game
---
IF UR ON PC ILL GIVE U FREE FLUX
---
But what I'm saying is I've been done exactly what you just said I'm full unyielding full biuld team not gonna lie didn't no about the squirrel stew was using cranberry cobbler stacked with can meat stew and I've been using my lunchboxes and I've played at least at least 4hrs day and I'm at 32 so if hes a streamer then he would've streamed him doing it show me proof he did it legit than I'll believe it
---
A trophy you get for participating, which is what every reward in the Legendary Run is, a reward for participating in it, theres no win or lose is there?
---
just imagine a meeting 🤣
---
Location is blank, not on Fandom either
---
At the le gourmand, if you dont see it st the protectron vender, server hop
---
I'm literally in a game where this is happening right now :(
---
You still are a wonder.
---
Black mentats would be awesome
---
Mentats
---
Nuka cola dark
---
Corpse flower stamen
---
The fact that duping stuff is wrong aside, which of course it is, I want to play devil's advocate for a minute.
---
I think it will actually make caps and stuff MORE useful not less. A large influx of rare things invariably makes them worth less, which makes caps worth more, or rather adds meaning to them again, as they were practically useless before. You can now buy a b/25/25 fixer for caps if you look around the trading markets and discords.
---
Unless you are a high level hoarder/trader this doesn't effect you in the slightest, all it's doing is giving newer players the facility to get something which was far outside their reach before now.
---
Downvote me all you like if you disagree, I'm just saying it how I see it.
---
Shockingly impressive.. and impressively shocking! Doing the math, you just have done the repeatable about about 1872 times! I thought I was doing well at about 105 repeatables!
---
i just skip the NW ones if i can’t get it done in one match with mostly AFK. I can get 300 points from the repeatable quest and be fine.
---
100% agree. but fairness and fairplay gets overrun by greed and lazyness. always was like that, will stay like that.  
---
only thing you can do is not participate.
---
The challenge is finding the time and dedication to do them every day for two months.
---
I too, hate making sales.
---
Literally screenshoted this for future reference, thank you!
---
I guess that's why they never got it in fallout 3. Lol.
---
Call me cynical but I would bet that there will be a way to spend (real) money to accelerate this process. So - grind all you want or, if you don't have all that free time,  hand over your cash.
---
They weren't rare before this latest method. Now there's two cars in every garage and a B2525 in every stash. Hopefully soon they'll be a consumable. Rather than burning a repair kit when one breaks, you just drop it and grab a new one.
---
Im level 320 and 600+ hours. Ive gotten it twice from the machine in all that time and I touch every machine I see.
---
I've had this result as well. Aside from some of the janky cliffsides
---
I don't need the caps that badly, I'm not gonna let someone act like a jerk to me in my base.
---
Says your offline
---
Most newish people don't know that they are a static spawn on West Tek roof. For the people who get them out of the machine its rare to happen.
---
The Tommy gun and mg42 need some love I need a dual drum for my bloodied ffr mg42 desperately

High level servers have been requested quite frequently but they don't listen..

So your gonna tell me that that you played 12hrs a day and had such an amazing loop you managed to complete the repeatable exp challenge 12 times every hr for the whole 12hr a day you played cuz that's the only way that you could be done by now I call bull shit show me proof you did it legit and mabey I'll believe you
---
Delete chatacter and start again?
---
Can i ask l. Do you have a rough idea what you want to do?
---
it doesnt requires to have this build. go to public team (construction) +1..4int &amp; serum "herd mentality" +2int &amp; serum "Egg Head" +6int &amp; SB (liver or brain) +3int &amp; sleep +5%xp &amp; mama dolce meat +5%xp (canbe changed with cranberry relish +10%xp) &amp; perks on charisma inspirational +15%xp // strange in numbers + 2int if u have a mutant in ur team. U can turn urself in a mutant permantly and reduce negative effects. In general I go with 20int and some +%xp and it is ok to lvl up within 1 hour. But actually if u go for it u will do it real quick.
---
First floor, first room, you have to go past them if you want to check out the rest of the metal wall between two cliffs that is my home, just south of sunnytop station, follow the tracks.
---
Holyshit, that's the solution

Farm Lead from the leadweights at the the lodge at Flatwoods,Charleston Fire Station and the Penetentiary and pick up all the weapons from the dead mutants/ghouls along the way and scrap them using the scrapper perk. Pick up Ammosmith and Super Duper perks as soon as they unlock when crafting ammo. Once u have the Excavator PA head over to Lucky Hole mine to get a bunch of lead ore.
---
uh, that would be awesome. its a long time i got scared of scorched but if i imagine a horde of lvl 99 of them runin on me...yeah, i would take that :D
---
There is a lot to explore. It's a large map. But also, it is a continuously evolving game. So even if you're bored with it now, you can always come back after the next update. A lot of people do that.
---
Thanks all! I'm running a demolition man build and those 40mm are weighing me down mostly!
---
Wait till you fight assualtrons
---
I learned from using mods on FO4 that you can do a lot with a little space. My house is only 4 tiles large (including porch tiles) and its big enough for the essentials: bed, stove, stash box, displays for guns mags and bobbles, and some wall decorations. The mini mansions i built in 4 just dont make sense in 76.
---
Get lead from the penitentiary in the toxic valley. Go to the prison courtyard and there is a huge weightlifting area. You can get around like 50 or more lead just from there in one run. There is also a worldbench in the courtyard for you to scrap stuff at
---
10000% agreed. Why we have to suffer bcz of cheaters? permanent b\*n for every dupper imho.
---
If Bethesda were behind it then we wouldn't be seeing the suspensions and bans that are now rolling out. Not sure what they're using as a metric for this, but I've seen copies of the emails folks have received and have no reason to doubt them.
---
I tried. I did today's though. 6 stims is easily done
---
Run level 3 inspirational - no one ever kicks ya then.
---
I want a Ghillie skin for the lever rifle
---
I can think of 2 legit reasons (other than bugs) this would happen. 
---
1: The first time you did it, was assigned from a previous session, perhaps.
---
2: Your daily objective countdown indicates when the day ends/begins (i.e. 10 a.m. EDT) and you just happened to be on both ends of that countdown. (i.e. 9:45 and 10:15)
---
Dude, my first comment on this thread WAS a joke (Wade's the one replying).
---
...Though at least you seem to get it.
---
still didn't let me copy it
---
What level are you? Cause I can be well rested, eat a cranberry pie, eat a canned meat stew, be in a fully bonded team, with strange in numbers and influential. But it'll still take me hours of running through savage divide, the mire and bog, all while doing events to get a level. I've resorted to just spending 15 mind making a new character and leveling them up.
---
I mean I would get it if two or three of their friends joined that team soon after, but last night, that guy remained solo for the next hour. Come on, we enlightened +INT folks need to stick together, folks!
---
it took me more than 2 month with settlers bcz i had choosed them during the quest line .. I cant wait more.. and I am in the finish line.
---
This and scorched beast brains are why I choose to go herbivore. Easier farming
---
I have completed every challenge every day since last Thursday. Other than nw ones , they are completed within an hour of normal play. This is by far one of the easiest battle passes around.
---
Duping wouldn’t be as popular if it wasn’t for Bethesda’s terrible system. There is zero things to do in this game aside from mindlessly find legendaries to kill for gear you want. You could literally kill 100 legendary enemies in a day and never get a weapon that’s even remotely useable. Over half of the legendary effects are useless. On top of all that, everything is time gated and capped. So it’s not like you can even spend a whole day farming legendaries and turning in scrip. This game doesn’t offer enough content for people to spend 1000’s of hours to obtain the things they want. I could be level 1000 and never have gotten the gun I want. Meanwhile a guy who just turned level 50 could get the weapon I’ve been grinding for after killing one enemy because everything is RNG. That’s why duping exists.
---
Throwing knifes are op and cheap
---
Didn't you read about me mentioning about a separate cooldown between spawns?
---
Yeah I’m def not complaining
---
According to Steam I never did the original story or the Wastelanders quest
---
Jesus, that sucks.  Another day in Bethesda's broken wasteland.    
---
I can't believe Bethesda isn't incredibly embarrassed by all of this.
---
This.  Level 3 inspirational and never been kicked once.  
---
People will always kick due to reasons.  Might even be their friend are joining.  But what players need to do is share perks when they are part of a team.  Bring something to the table.
---
So skip the NW challenges and focus on getting 30k XP in adventure instead. That is 300 score..
---
Personally I like NW and do that as something else to do than farming crap and just do the NW challenges if it is possible reasonably easy.
---
Level 31 right now on the battlepass
---
Probably the victim of some vicious verbal retort
---
There is a lot wrong with this, first of all the game is already p2p wich already implemented a microtransaction (haha micro) a subscription and now also a battlepass system wich compared to most battlepass skips costs twice if not triple the amount of what free to play passes ask. 
---
I agree that earning rewards is great, but currently the system is so strict on how to progress that it's pretty much impossible to finish it for those with jobs or have a dynamic schedule.
---
I agree that not everything needs to be free as the developers need to make a living too, but Bethesda is currently pushing their MTX more and more to the point they are more monitized than your average gacha mobile games.
---
It's also the way implement it that is not user friendly . 
---
no catch up system
---
Time gated progression
---
FOMO time limited seasons
---
Increasing difficulties of daily and weeklies
---
Xp requirement per level
---
It's a combination on how they handle this is what dissapoints me and a lot of other players.
---
Yea,I see where you are coming from.I don’t have the time nor do I want to grind for a new weapon/armor set.
---
I quite liked the mistress of mystery quest line,it could have been a different theme,but that’s personal preference.If only there were more quests like that in the game
---
Nice. I've got a good stock of food/drugs and moved to a second character so they don't spoil while I play for score.
---
Laughs in robobrain laser (bugged one at the  radio tower n the ash heap)
---
Make sure it is set to read only in the file properties. If it is not, then the game somehow just deletes it upon start
---
From my tests you spawn directly north of where your c.a.m.p. is placed facing the opposite direction from your camp and you spawn in the same distance away from the c.a.m.p. everytime unless someone else is traveling at the same time as you. That means if you leave your c.a.m.p. in the very middle of the circle you will spawn on edge of camp circle if you place on the edge of camp circle you then spawn the same distance north of where you place your camp.
---
On the community road map they released last week, they said the new season starts in patch 22, 2 weeks after this season ends
---
Awesome news, many thanks!
---
PARTY!! invite everyone on your friend list to your camp, and make a fresh batch of nukashine for the punchbowl...
---
70 days for this events and this is day 9? I believe. You could still make it but not at that pace. Try to boost your INT/rest/use food and drugs to boost XP
---
Black powder rigles are the way to go my friend. A sbq can break it like twice if you tried maybe even three times
---
I allied with Foundation but dear god if they could just be less smug about everything. I'm starting to have think they deserve to be raided every other day.
---
Doesn't mean that someone won't charge you 2 or 3 players' max caps for them.
---
I disagree play how you want just dont bother otherplayers i say its ok to cheat and to cheat op weapons just dont give them away or use them in events.
---
For a list of perks as well as planning your build I recommend nukesdragon.com they have an excellent build planner
---
Don't listen to that guy, he's full of shit and proved him wrong many times.
---
Hes a Bethesda white knight for a living hence why he got time to play.
---
Wait so thats why my black powder rifle was as durable as three paper clips stringed together?
---
Guys...just make a new character, you get a level as you leave the vault
---
Some people already hits level 100 of Season... Great job Bethesda!
---
Wait killing the power actually makes them unusable now cause it used to just remove your icon from the map but you can still buy stuff
---
I did melee and throwing knives, and just shredded my second play through. Truly underrated how cheap and powerful a throwing knife can be. Plus when you get good you can hit enemies before your gun-toting friends take aim and impress them
---
Something similar happened to me today. Spent 1.500 rounds killing the queen with my stealth character. She dies, i have my stealth meter saying i am hidden and a cave bug comes from the other side of the map ignoring everyone around and goes straight for me. I got one shot, dies, someone "steals" my fluxes i nuke their camp. Just another day of "just works" mechanics i guess.
---
I’ve only seen that happen when I’ve NOT managed to do any damage to them! Happened yesterday with a legendary mirelurk during Heart of the Swamp :(
---
i base mine off of time restrictions, im prone to shredding drywall at work when im tired and cranky.  (dont bury my shit)
---
- weekend / enough spare time = use main
---
- weekday / close to bedtime = use alt
---
What havent I responded to?
---
I aint got to time for fucktards in the wasteland.  I just jump servers.  Not a big deal.
---
Keep pumping those numbers lol Caps are on the XP given (like a single kill seems to Max out at 4k XP)
---
I suggest taking out 9 points from Charisma and moving them wherever you have your best weapon. Strength for shotgun/melee/heavy, Perception for rifles, Agility for pistols. Consider an extra 3 points in Perception to equip Night Person for +3 INT and +3 PER at night.
---
If you're doing more damage with your weapon of choice, you don't have to worry so much about repairing as much. People focus too much on keeping their weapon alive while forgetting killing the enemy faster saves ammo and condition.
---
Ive heard those getting it through glitches have gotten banned
---
Idk I was told it doesnt prevent people in the comments. Still prevented them by scrapping the vendor they tried to use tho. I just assumed it worked to prevent them because he didnt try the two that i didnt scrap.
---
They could just make a nsfw tag if that a issue
---
If you think it's easy to die to the first player that finds you, wait until Vats for players is enabled. Good luck being anywhere near another player without an aim bot shooting you in the head or revealing your positioning by spamming Q.
---
Thank you! Copying the .ini fixed the game for me!
---
Make a ton of nukashine invite the server to your camp and hand one out, everyone drinks you included and have fun
---
I ended up jumping shortly after to my fiancée's private world so we could quest together, plus I wasn't sure he wouldn't try to do something to my CAMP. But scrapping it in front of his face still felt nice before I eventually left lol
---
I was at Utanium fever once with my level 350 and it was just me and a level 20-something. I was there for the glowing meat and junk. I didn't want to one-shot everything and steal his xp so I followed behind him, killing things only after he'd gotten a shot in. It was tedious but I was being a nice neighbor, yanno?
---
...until he snapped in area chat "Imagine you just STANDING around while I do all the work!?!"
---
I had to explain to him that I was actually just not stealing his XP. He got nicer after that. 
---
TLDR - we're not leeching. We're getting event rewards for score or bullion but trying not to take all the xp on you.
---
Yeah, I thought they were so lazy to fix it with the atoms, they changed the system but here we are with the same BS .. pathetic to say the least .. shame on them and can't even fix some basic concepts or at least have a system to compensate players. Just keep logging calls until they fix it .. or compensate you. They will never get a dime from me until they start fixing some of the old bugs.
---
Yep, that’s why it’s still on a paper lol
---
I'm disabled and I work part-time. I used to have a long commute on the bus for work. I would come home from work and hop on. I've gotten to know more people on 76 and I have a core group that I've been playing with for about a year now. These people are in different places and have become my friends outside of the game. They know the issues I deal with and will check on me if they don't see me in game for too long. While some days can be a little boring, a lot of the times we do stuff together as a team. I honestly look forward to playing with them and hanging out in party chat. I am limited in some ways which sucks when it comes to a social life. So this game has brought me a lot of happiness and some great friends.
---
Int over 1200 hours in and still enjoying it. I do think the constant inventory management and load screens are NOT fun, but the rest of the game is quite enjoyable. Personally, I made it a point to do the things I enjoyed and not worry about the other things. I took my time getting through the main story and explored the open works more. I took my time getting to max reputation and enjoyed the random encounters more. I do grind the dailies, but I think they're balanced; they don't take too much time and it's kind of fun to have something different to do on a daily basis.
---
This game is what people make of it. If they feel all they're doing is chores then of course they're not having fun. Explore, meet people, build, shoot stuff, make your own fun.... If your able to do that then this game is amazing. If not then I'm not surprised why people don't like the game.
---
The Effort to put this in is again much playtime to put in I rather spend just playing the game.
---
Also I hate Mutations and Avoid them at all cost.
---
fluxes got from SBQ's mission disappeared if u die, it's game mechanic
---
Junk Gun loaded with Teddy Bears! Love those super muties to death!
---
Yes you should be able to, some dailies are bugged, so may not pop up
---
As for me u should stop asking "this kind of" questions. But honestly what r u expected to see as response?
---
Thanks! Always had it so random ones pop up each day but might check manually. Maybe mine are bugged
---
If I see a sub level 40 I see it my duty to drop them stims. I remember other players doing the same for me.  The pay it forward attitude in this community is great.
---
Place your camp somewhere in the forest, that way you’ll only get low level mobs attacking your base. (I recommend Helvetia, lovely little town.)
---
Sleep in your bed for Well Rested and do an event called Feed The People for canned meat stew, both give you a little XP boost to help you level up faster. (Playing an instrument also gives you well tuned that makes your AP regen faster.)
---
Scrap weapons and armor you can’t or don’t want to use to learn mods for them. 
---
Morgantown Airport has a little garden for you to get some beginners crops to start your garden at your camp.
---
Don’t do the main quest until you’re level 50 that way all the rewards will be max level and much more useful to you in the long run.
---
Another tip to go with that one, save your skill points, then when you hit level 50 and find some gear you can decide what to spec for. (Or just get whatever seems nice then respec later by leveling up if you want.)
---
Always pick up stuff with screws and adhesive in them, fans, type writers, wonderglue, duct tape, etc.
---
Flatwoods has a ton of Brahmin in them, *Don’t kill them* unless you’re absolutely starving and need food, You can milk them for Brahmin milk which will restore your food water and some rads, very handy if you don’t have rad away. (Flatwoods is also a really neat little town to camp outside of.)
---
Different Regions in this game have different levels of enemies. I recommend avoiding other regions and events in those regions unless you’re well prepared. Here’s the levels of enemies in these regions.
---
Forest: Lvl.1 to Lvl.10 
---
Toxic Valley: Lvl.10 to Lvl.20 
---
Ash Heap: Lvl.20 to Lvl.30 
---
Savage Divide: Lvl.40 to Lvl.60+
---
Mire: Lvl.60+
---
Cranberry Bog: Lvl.60+
---
Your max level is 50, after that you don’t get any more special points. Any levels after that you can only use the skill points to get new perks or respec special points.
---
*Don’t go to the mire at night.*
---
Train Stations have Vendors, and those vendors have 1400 caps a day, pick up anything and everything you can to sell to them to get these caps every day, the max caps you can hold is 30,000. There is also scrip machines at train stations that let you scrap legendary weapons and armor you don’t want into points called scrip, you can spend scrip at the Purveyor to get legendary weapons or armor.
---
*Seriously don’t go to the mire at night.* It’s pitch black and there’s always something hiding in the dark waiting to jump out and bite your nuts off. It’s a shite place to build a camp.
---
As you explore places you may come across daily quests, quests you can do once a day when they’re available and they reward supplies and scrip.
---
Don’t hoard stuff, you have very limited stash space that you gotta share with stuff you wanna keep and materials for building. (Unless you buy the subscription for unlimited scrap storing... But I don’t recommend getting that unless you play often and get use out of it.)
---
Workshops are places full of resource nodes and you have to clear the enemies out of them before you can take them, once you take them you can build resource collectors and you have to defend your workshop every once in awhile. Be warned though, Workshops are PVP modes, meaning other players can kill you and take your workshop. Speaking of which, go into the options and turn on passive mode. It’ll keep you from accidentally initiating PVP. But other players can still kill you in workshops even if you have passive on.
---
I’ve played this game for 1700 hours now, if you have any questions feel free to ask me. I’m sure I know a thing or two to help ya.
---
I ran into one of these on Xbox today. Was great to see organization and displays
---
There's just a SCORE challenge for leveling up once per day. People at 100+ it will take quite a while.
---
Ops... Well i guess i need to apologize to someone for that nuke. But the cave cricket targeting me in stealth was still bullshit.
---
What a whiny nonsense post
---
I notice mine on my daily tab are not tagged, they all untagged, started happening a few updates ago. I have to manually activate events.
---
Yeah I’m going to check in a bit! I’ve missed out on a ton if so!
---
Or in a cave, or kills something in a specific region, wearing sunglasses on a full moon in a clown suit!  Happy to see that gone, but we all did get good at it and carried a lot of outfits around!
---
I found one sitting on a roof randomly.
---
Did you ever think that maybe the majority of players do not like the game for what it is but for what can be made of it by cheating? Progression is pathetically slow, you do the same 2-4 activities in loop, and at the end you have next to nothing to show for your hours of wasted time. But if you make a hacked weapon here or god mode exploit there, suddenly the game feels more fun.  
---
I personally havent played the game in months. Its not fun anymore. I cant stand to look at what it has become, especially with the Legendary Run. If you want people to stop cheating, incentivize people to play fairly.
---
could i change some serums for flux? 1 to 3. Actually I need cobalt ones.
---
You can level up as many times as you like. However, the first one will get you 250 score for a daily "level up once" challenge, whereas other ones won't.
---
Same for me, same reason
---
You folks on PC? I've constructed a small church you may be interested in.
---
It’s one challenge a day, you’ll survive
---
You have 15k atoms earned up by playing normally? Nice, but what willyou do on the next season?
---
Oh man reading his comment history I see that now, I give Bethesda the benefit of the doubt as much as I can but these grinds get pressing after a while even though I love the game
---
It might also depend on what perks were being shared or if you were sharing a perk at all also.
---
"this thing I'm **choosing** to do is boring and feels like a chore"
---
And the last levels will be the hardest, requiring the most grinding of xp. It's definitely smart to save those atoms for the last few levels.
---
And ALL of the vendors take 10% of the sale price, no matter what skin you use or the base version.
---
Yes, some mechanics in the game are yet to "just works"
---
Nothing is rare anymore.  weapons that used to sell for $400-500 real money are now being traded for bobbleheads and flux. 
---
The Fallout 76 economy is permanently broken. The presents and junk dupe *hurt* the economy, but this weapons dupe has **permanently** broken the economy.   The Fallout 76 community will NEVER recover from this.   
---
The asshole in me DOES enjoy one thing about this...all the obnoxious d-bags on other trade platforms (not so much here on reddit) that used to sit on their high horses with their rare legacy collections must be absolutely devastated, as their once priceless collections are now worth dog shit.  Hahahaha.
---
As an aside... If you find brain fungus and collect it... and have the recipe for Brain Fungus Soup... make some. Brain fungus soup gives +2 to INT for the duration as a food item.
---
That’s the issue I was having !!!!! Still have it going on sadly after redownloading so I’m done with this game giving it a break for now time to play other games
---
Siding with foundation gets you the stealth armor.
---
My favourite part is not having to worry about brewing 25 different varieties of alcohol!
---
Care Bear Death Squad.
---
Everything stuck at 50 and 3 star, everyone knows eventually it will go higher. I just hope they have the duping well tied up before hand.
---
When a raider kills in cold blood and then cheerily declares “I’m all for takin’ what ain’t mine,” don’t be upset if the next thing he takes happens to be a bullet traveling right-of-way.
---
Im in the process of creating the guide, since you guys have shown such interest. Guide should be up in an hour or so :)
---
Keep going till 176
---
The duping has been going on non stop for months and months. That fixer has not been rare for a long time :/
---
Congrats men. Fellow raider as myself is also grinding.
---
Thought it's a lot harder I'm barely level 88 and I don't have super Uber gear. But I do run with cranberry relish //13 base int and inspirational perks.
---
Since I have 15 str I was considering to switch to melee build to conserve ammo ( ammo is a bit of pain to feed my 50 cal ). Because I dropped a nice mole gauntlet 3*.
---
Iam at 36 rank ATM.
---
Holy Stash space Batman!
---
Actually this happened to me a lot of times but lately I store my valuable junk every 5 minutes only bcz of  respawn bug. I hate it more than invisible enemies and "no possibility to switch weapon" during sbq.
---
..sounds like a good faction name :)
---
I have a rtx 2080 ti ftw3 ultra at the moment I don’t think it’s bad hardware  all other games work perfectly fine its only fallout. After reinstalling the game is 10x laggier and in the 6-12 FPS now. Every other game is fine at max setting :/. I gave up on fallout 76 so I’ll be playing other games now
---
After reinstalling the game the FPS it 10x worse and way laggier then before :/. Gave up on the game for now
---
If you play Fallout 4, in the Nuka World repair building by the junkyard, there is a pie machine that works every time. Which leads me to believe it is there for repairs so it will stop doing that.
---
Which repeatable quest ?
---
Yes first thing I do with al my games but after reinstalling the game is worse then it was before so I’m giving this game up and going to play other games for now since I have about 500 games on steam gives me time to appreciate the graphics of other games for now
---
HUGGERS TO THE FRONT! I WANT TO SEE THOSE ARMS SPREAD WIDE!
---
KISSY FACES! PUCKER UP!
---
there are actually multiple exploits going around:
---
1) "god mode" and leveling to 100 SCORE in matter of minutes (or level 1000 in the process)
---
2) train station duping
---
And yes we also have legacy or cheat weapons still kept in player stashes hence the interest in duping them again. 
---
All in all it looks like Bethesda simply do not have enough development bandwidth to handle the game. There is no way in online game reacting to such exploits should take days/weeks/months (and god mode was known and reported for years). Company should target "hours" as reaction time IMO.
---
I absolutely despise NW but that creature challenge only took me 2 matches. The 2nd match I actually won just by sneaking around and hiding. Looking for and finding little red blips on my compass.  I put on the 100% more damage to creatures perk.  You basically one shot any creature.
---
 That challenge is actually very easy.
---
This. At least don’t expect something getting (even) better or more enjoyable while remaining silent.
---
When are they going to release the damned leg/arm deep pockets?????
---
Yeah pathetic .. went from 3. creatures to 9 and 3 stimpacks to 6. I think they trying to stop casual players heading into NW just for the challenge an leaving, but that was the point wasn't it to do the challenge. Supposed to part of our normal gameplay but yet forcing people into a mode they don't want to be in. Making it tedious isn't a solution just lame.
---
You can get a little bit of Raider rep by turning in Mirelurk meat at Ohio River Adventures (West side of the map, above Camden Park). You can turn in like 1 Queen meat or 10 normal meat or 15 eggs.
---
okie
---
How do you even find ANY mob in this game difficult.. I am literally two-shotting Scorchbeast Queen and i see 50+ level people complaining about mr gutsy lmao
---
if they ever have player factions, (guilds) in the game, I call dibs on Care Bear Death Squad and the Rainbow Hobos.
---
My vendors are at the back of my build, in the workshop/garage looking building
---
Yeah they do a good amount of dmg, especially in groups.
---
This is gold...
---
Not according to this, read the bottom
---
[https://imgur.com/V4qTnlL](https://imgur.com/V4qTnlL)
---
Hehe, that’s gay.
---
I just switch Server if it happens. No need for those caps.
---
God mode apparently is also not fixed and exploiters level to 100 score under minutes.
---
Create an alt, leave vault, run to wayward, do anything to hit level 3.
---
thanks will do, been mostly checking bridge near Boomer and other reported spawn spots, its my login ritual now hah
---
Since the Legendary Race my time is to precious. There is not enough XP to gain at this Event sadly...
---
Only reason to go inside the tunnel is to harvest brain fungus to cook soup for int.
---
...wooo....
---
I'm not sure why don't have Mistress of Mystery radio plays to listen to, especially since they are a faction with their own pretty great questline.
---
Im a melee/demolition build and mama Murphy gave me a fucking 2shot auto grenade launcher yesterday! Soooo happy
---
They could always balance the "meta builds" then do all that stuff, including adding new weapons/levels.
---
I went on vacation for a few weeks so I stopped doing dailies. And now I have no motivation to start up on the game again
---
I look at the list and don't feel like playing any more.
---
At one point when i started playing with a friend i got 3 pies in 2 days of playing. I started to think my friend was a luck charm 😂
---
After 1053hrs I've decided to stop commenting on these 'quitting' threads starting....
---
I can almost taste the wonderful pizza crusts I can roll out with that!
---
being a little bitch for correcting bad information and going out of my way to provide the source, thats new
---
"okay...?"  LOL
---
6 stims.
---
I did in a single run, around the Vault-Tec university, there are a quite sum of trashbins, that can contain stims. Also, I was lucky, found an explosive bow... so the self explosion allowed me to spam the heal button, and tada... done.
---
Can karma use to exchange atoms or what, if not y need grind
---
Source?
---
Interesting. That didn’t work in the past. If I run across one in a vendor I’ll pick it up and try.
---
Half of these would look good if it wasn't for the random fo76 logo.
---
Vanguards?
---
^^ honestly while I never exploited the game, I can understand in a way where the duping comes from. The end game grind is just day after day after day of rng loot with almost no way of improving the chance to get what you want. I spent the last half year trying get a bloodied handmade or a better fixer to no luck. The worst part is BGS limit up with the daily scrip. Not only is you ability to get what you want completely random but it is limited every 20 hours.
---
😂
---
Obviously not...
---
Thank you. But they aren’t quite “random” I placed them there very specificity lol.
---
It was about 1 minute after sbq died, I didn't even get the chance to store my stuff.
---
I had stored it before the nuke dropped but.
---
Drop bears
---
Poyfekt Timing!
---
Just not any other event.
---
Flux is the only thing I actually kind of want at lvl 460
---
Ghillies skins for Handmades/Fixers is what we need!

Well, the ticket thing didn’t work out so well. Just a generic “verify your files and re-install” response. I’ve been fortunate with possum badges. The dailies give me at least one a day the majority of the time. I’ve nearly emptied the possum badge vendor. And the auto scrap thing sucks. Seems like they should be able to make display items off-limits for scrapping.
---
Yeah, when your only goal is better weapons and gear, that can only go on for so long. I was at about 200hrs in when I switched my main goal to ‘build the best camp ever’. Now I feel I’m finally getting closer to that goal at 2k+ hours in. Still not there so I’m still playing and learning new things every day. So if you enjoy the core gameplay and environment, maybe just change your goals around some? Camp building is just one suggestion, but it does offer endless hours of learning and improving with no real end in sight.
---
I completely agree.
---
I feel like Beth's logic was that if challenges weren't as easy to do in 5 minutes, more people would play more like the mode was intended. I.E.instead of spawning in on the edge of the map,  placing 3 camps, and then either killing yourself or hiding in bushes, you'd run around looking for the things you need to complete the challenges, thus increasing the chances that you'll run into other players.
---
But I can't imagine that's the case. I'd rather get 30,000 experience for 300 SCORE in half or less of the time it would take me to track down 3 locks, 6 stimpacks, or 9 creatures, for 250 SCORE. Hell, I didn't even feel like doing the 3 creatures one from earlier this week. Sure, the added weekly was a nice touch, but I would rather save myself some frustration and just focus on the XP repeatable. Even with static spawns on things like locked containers, sitting through load screens and lobbies multiple times for 250 SCORE isn't happening for me.
---
I doubt I'm the only one who feels this way, so I'd imagine these challenges make more people play zero matches, rather than make those that were doing the NW challenges play more than one or two matches.
---
Just leave the menu. Get out ur gun and shoot em in the face...
---
At least thats what i would have done.
---
No, he had Unyielding!
---
Well, yeah, if you can push the buyer from the vendor, you have a chance to interupt and get the goodies for yourself.
---
But if I remember, nuke mines wont work anymore, they fixed something with them.
---
They should reuse scrips or gold bullion for that.
---
Assaultrons are actually super easy to kill if you shoot them in the legs and cripple them! It took me a while to figure that out.
---
They were a higher level than me and my weapons and gear aren't quite the best yet so I'm not sure I'd win that fight. Plus if doing the NW challenges has taught me anything it's that I suck at shooting players lol
---
I think i will have to retract my statement as i can longer find the post citing that they were. Sorry.
---
Buy on Sunday. Seems to work perfectly that way
---
Ow
---
Not 100% sure then.
---
There's a perk in agi that increases DR/ER for each point of agility, could have been that working alongside the agi buff from the armour.
---
I just trap base people for giggles.
---
Just left a game with over 2000 plans in vending.
---
They justhappened to have a huge expensive base with 80 crocodile backpacks plans, 200 treasure hunter plans, etc.
---
Although I would LOVE the backpack. I refuse to make the rich richer when clearly they are duplicates
---
go to the game on game pass and select "enable mods" then show moddable folder
---
Yeah player vendors work too.
---
We should be able to have armor piercing bullets since they can use 'em
---
That's exactly what I do once I can actually see them. They do get the drop on me sometimes though.
---
The settlers are assholes, the Raiders are way better and have better rewards. Of course they would rather stand at Ground Zero of a nuclear detonation then become besties with the foundation.
---
On the other side of that, do keep in mind that nukes have been out since the beginning of the game, and that launching a nuke is way easier than grinding dailies for a month-and-a-half
---
Pretty much, try running the math on what the chances are for getting a b/25/25 fixer from a random drop, it's literally 100,000's to one.
---
Gating the content behind time delays just compounds the problem.
---
I will start working on that immediately!
---
Cause she’s right.
---
A true believer. Your work will not go unnoticed by Him.
---
Because that’s her personality. And there’s possibly some background to explain it that we haven’t seen or hadn’t been written yet.
---
Outside of loosing rep for screwing one faction over during the raid there doesn't seem to be any other ways to lose rep that I have found.  I kill raiders I find while exploring every time and loot them for their stims and rifles, it has never caused me to lose rep.  As far as I can tell you don't have anything to worry about once the vault raid is done.
---
Ok that was always allowed
---
You end up as cram if you resist us.
---
Yeah. I'll swap around perks and see what's up. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with 400+...but damn! Over 700?
---
Dude, that just means you need to move on to a different game.
---
Do queen meat, you get more raider rep that wait.
---
innovsurcivalist? (probably spelled wrong) has a few screenshots in her latest video about them
---
thats all ive seen outside of todays deleted thread
---
We do not require fancy weapons. Just the will to sacrifice it all for Him.
---
They aren't in Fallout 3, or New Vegas though?
---
Blessed. Join us.
---
What's wrong with the atom bomb baby song though? what am i missing
---
Yeah true but I'm lazy and sometimes don't want to run back and forth all the time lol
---
There's diminishing returns from DR, so the difference between 400 and 700 may not be that much.
---
I wouldn’t worry too much about it since there are significant diminishing returns at about the 400 mark, IIRC. But you can get DR/ER from other sources, like underarmor, backpacks and perks.
---
What is this blatant blasphemy! Heathen!
---
possibly
---
Starting.... *now!*
---
Tell our good friend Feumsi he shall start his own cult &amp; we will all be one in the eyes of Him.
---
We must do what we can with what was given. He appreciates our efforts regardless. 
---
Also, I totally agree!!
---
Are we sure that’s not a weekly challenge possible in the future?  I’d be happy to see it go, myself.
---
So far I'm lucky to have Daguerre only use her incredible teleportation technique. She hasn't yet learned how a doorknob works.
---
Thank you, this is exactly what I wanted to make light of but people aren't realizing this and are instead just saying "lol it's easy, I just did it myself, just do this" 
---
It has nothing to do with how "easy" or "hard" a challenge is but more that we have differentiating lengths of challenges that are rewarding the same amount of score. If they're going to repeat dailies but put in different numbers then make the score equal to those. 
---
Like you said: 
---
\- First time it was 1 legendary, now it's 3 and we get the same score? Just give us more score. It's more laughable because we already have kill 3 legendaries **as a weekly** currently and that was buffed, it was 10 the previous week and now it's 3. 
---
\- New players aren't in the know with things and are not able to just breeze through West Tek and finish half their dailies in 15 minutes. Hell, I doubt a lot of the lesser experienced players don't even realize Leader of the Pack exists. It's entirely possible to play this game and not pass by events or care about them. 
---
All I suggest is if there's going to be repeated dailies or weeklies with varying numbers required to meet their marks, reward score equivalent of that. If we have to kill 10 Scorched today and kill 30 in four days, they should **not** give the same score.
---
I just like using a new toon because it takes like 10 minutes to knock this out quickly, letting me then switch back to my main with no pressure to get to a certain amount of xp. I’ll still hit the 10k challenge a few times after, but if it was slightly less xp than what was needed to level up, no problem, that one is already done.
---
Especially when the most fun in this game is the wandering/exploring aspect to it. Just want to play and relax, not check of tick boxes.
---
He bestowed it upon us for our dedicated service. 
---
Also, I have no clue. Someone we recruited had it.
---
Yup. Im on my toes because i have no ammo to kill other enemies
---
We are fine mothman believer! 
---
What’s your IGN? And when will you be praying?
---
There’s no need for such hatred in your heart.
---
Change legendary enemies so they do not blow up after you kill them.
---
I haven't picked it up, and didn't even know it was a vendor skin for a few days... even visited a nice looking camp decked out like a Slocums diner and got frustrated I couldn't find his vendor fronts, even though hovering over the camp icon clearly showed him selling 100's of items.
---
I feel u, I have been lurkin the subs for a while hoping things improve. Cmon cyberpunk 🍺
---
Looked it up.. hacked game file. It's not meant to be in game yet. Probably a future Atom Shop purchase like the pristine moleman one was.
---
Exactly. 
---
You’re asking a question about the psyche of a non-player character. But the only information we have about her is literally what she tells us over the radio. 
---
I’m not sure how any of us can definitively know her motivations.
---
the 10k xp for 100 score
---
I have medic build.  Back when we all had crap gear, nuked and farmed the WS for experience/legendaries, and thought launching a nuke was actually a challenging group effort I played her a ton.  These days she sits around her camp sharing perk cards.  IMO the current content simply doesn’t need a medic.  I would love to see this change.  I remain hopeful that at some point we will get more true MMO style boss fights that reward specialist tactics and gameplay.
---
You should play what you like but there are so many more interesting/rewarding builds out there I would place this one low on my current interest list.
---
I understand that and you play however you like, you'll get no judgements from me. I tend to agree with the sentiment actually.
---
When the price was 500k caps in trade value before due to scarcity (an amount literally unattainable by literally 99.9% of the player base), and now it's available for 10k or 20k, I see why people go for it though.
---
This game is far from excellent
---
You’re the reason I can’t find any power armor frames! /s. I accidentally scrapped mine and haven’t been able to find a replacement.
---
I kind of find it fascinating overall. It really drives home how engrained social media is with modern games, how inseparable we've all made it..a lot of us get more entertainment from the subs and forums than the actual game..
---
..imagine just playing the game without any offline information about cheaters, dupers, exploiters..? ..just happily chugging along, collecting your screws and blasting at ghouls..
---
That was a great find
---
I was trading with a level 74 once and noticed that he had 500 large christmas presents on him. Like wtf? How do you even do that and why? They are absolutely shit.
---
I agree with you, and have thought the same thing. On this forum, it seems like a lot of the posters are like what you first describe, only interested in the best gear and weapons. Which I think is pretty easy goal. But I also feel that once you get there, it trivializes the game. 
---
There's a lot of stuff to the game outside of that. But if a person only focuses on that, the game quickly does become a grind. 
---
For me, and my friends, we like to make rules about things. Like limiting fast travel. And then we pick a new way to get where we need to go. 
---
We've done things like, treasure map runs. We've managed to discover a lot of little things in the game we never knew existed. And would never if we hadn't avoided fast travel.
---
The game isn't perfect. But it's also what you make of it.
---
From the picture, gillie underarmor and gillie hat match, but all the others from Legendary Run are more green?
---
You can just open up the camp editor and delete (store) the Vending Machine too.
---
Damn, I’m not sure He would approve of that. Marks against this new recruit.
---
Buttressed mod?
---
No joy... still get this message
---
very good I have water purifiers with mounted glowing ones skulls near the taps
---
That's nuts,  I had never tried before,  didn't know they even existed until I saw a post about it a few weeks ago. Tried for my first time like 2 weeks ago and the first time I tried I got one.  
---
Not sure what the big deal is though? It didn't seem to do anything special.
---
I wish the cyrolator was a Fireman Protectron arm.
---
Also, try the Stanley skin for the Grognak Axe.
---
If you played NW when it first became playable, youd know that NPCs in NW was a glitch and not intentional. Instead of fixing it, they just began tracking it in NW and called it a "feature".
---
Given what i posted, what would you assume?   
---
Seriously whats wrong with atom bomb baby?   
---
And whats so funny about a woman who lies and shoots men?
---
Whitesprings Sentry Boy Farming
---
The delay was like a punch to the nuts
---
There are limits because end game has a low ceiling and there is zero scale to fallout 76.
---
I might have to add weigh 90% less troubleshooters to my wishlist.
---
it objectifies women based on appearance. Yes, it's does so in a silly manner. So it's not really a love song. It's a (humorous) sex song.
---
Honestly I didn't know it was.  The life events I mentioned in it have started to take place so I have not been able to really keep up with things like I normally would.
---
I would even take a funny novelty gun, maybe a Syringer mod, that makes a bundle of colorful balloons pop out of tagged enemies when they die.
---
Tales from the West Virginia Hills should also be expanded and made into a radio station
---
I there perks for improving DR? I know all improved damage perk card charge the listed damage directly of the effected weapon, so it might be that.
---
I see all these fancy houses &amp; think "Wow that's really neat I should build something!" and then I just chuck everything outside in a big circle surrounded by automated turrets. At least my Vendors are easy to find?
---
Yeah, I agree with this. There have been a few clips and/or photos I wanted to share from my time in the wasteland, but ultimately couldn’t. I think it would be great for community creativity. There could even be challenges around clips of the week or something.
---
This is the first weapon/armor dupe in over a year ...
---
I suck at math but you most likely are!  I'm just a strange example given my situations.
---
Yes I hate it.
---
if I had to guess, we'll get something new in content concerning Julie in the months ahead.
---
(just hope she's not a robot like Rose 🙄)
---
I'm not sure why this is important.
---
On PC? OP had "PC" in his title. It's been going on for a very long time on PC, if it ever stopped at all.
---
How? can you provide proof please?   
---
" Got a doll baby, i love her so nothing else like her any where you go "
---
I've been bored of the main game since capping out my wastelanders factions out. The Legendary Run brought me back to finishing my dailies, can usually do them in 40 or so minutes (specially if you use a low level character to do the level up once ones).
---
But I've been hitting Nuclear Winter lots this week because they've been giving away cosmetic items from past Halloween &amp; Christmas events (that I never did back then) when you rank up... just rolled the glow-in the dark skeleton costume and lots of neat weapon cosmetics.
---
I made a little town near Morgantown under the railroad bridge called Scraptown. I've made sure to make a 2x3 garage with lights and Vault boy signs pointing to it so that it's obvious the vendors are in there. 
---
I also keep the vendors loaded with new things, so come on down to Scraptown where the crappiest scrap is sold for realistic capitalistic prices! 
---
Vendor satisfaction is not guaranteed.
---
I feel the opposite.  I took waaaaay too much time making my CAMP look cool and I want people to  come see it.  Coming back to all the doors open means someone came by and had a look!
---
I would assume that you think she’s sexist herself if she takes offense at one song but laughs at another.
---
Maybe she thinks it’s wrong for men to refer to women as volatile and also thinks that men that treat women poorly deserve to be shot.
---
Mm ok I guess.
---
Exactly right. There are so many things to dive into with the game, the combat and gear is just what’s most appealing to a lot of folks. 
---
With my base building goal, it gives me new things to look forward to all the time. I chase all new plans, so the legendary run is very appealing to me. I used to race through daily and weekly challenges to get as much out of the atom shop as I could, now I’ll focus more on the world and character challenges I’ve not attempted yet for that. I farm events for plans. I follow so much that comes from the building community to learn new camp building tips and share my own secrets often. This gets me engaged socially. I’ve maintained a 2x max budget camp for over 2 months now, constantly making changes, which is way harder than it sounds. And I’ve been practicing new build methods for my next camp at workshops daily. All while running my camp as a roadside sideshow/plans shop and giving tours frequently. There’s a lot to do, but you do have to find your own enjoyment in a sense
---
Why even lower? Most MMOs have character slots out the ass and far larger servers than what 76 offers.
---
Wrong , this only hurts the real money market which is a good thing . The people who had godrolls already aren’t upset tho. To do the dupe you need 2 things , 1 a legacy laser and 2 godrolls worth duping
---
I don't even get that far. I did two of them today.
---
Well sure, if you want to go all *reality* about it. But that's a stretch for this game. It's more annoying than anything, but I get your point.
---
The RNG in this game, as well as the removal of explosive lasers, make it so that you can play for a billion years, and still not have the gun that you want. If Bethesda really cared about stopping d*per's, they would make it to the enough legendary modules would let you put whatever effect you wanted on a gun. That would crash the d*ping market, because then you would just need scrip, which can be gained from events like uranium fever, scorched-earth, and heart of the swamp. I love this game, and started playing it when the stress test came out, but the fact that it is incredibly difficult to get a gun that can match your build, let alone optimize it, is extremely ridiculous.
---
That being said, if you do d*pe, expect to get burned, because you're already playing with fire, so don't act surprised.
---
While 76 has a lot of problems that need fixing, let's not kid ourselves that this is exclusively a Bethesda problem. Any online game will have to deal with cheating and most of those cheaters just want to 'watch the world burn' and don't care about what game they are cheating at. The problems that are totally Bethesda's fault are the ease with which the cheating happens due to a rushed game that was ported to multiplayer from and old engine that was not desigmed with security in mind. And the fact that they don't ever actually patch the exploits, they just patch the method of the exploits, which is probably because of the first problem more than a lack of caring on Bethesda's part.
---
Ghilliie my SS armor!!
---
Mine does teleport to the roof and back sometimes!
---
I had to repare 10 weapons or armor for a daily. A little to extreme for 250 Score
---
This fails to take into account the amount of atoms you get from rewards that can be directly used to rank up.
---
Oh no definitelt, i made my CAMP with visitors being the biggest priority too, it's just such an OCD annoyance for me to find my doors open 😂
---
Apparently enough for me to do a whole post
---
Lol level 60 legendaries. Lol that would fix everything lol
---
And they say magic isn't real. Hogwash.
---
I got that same email from them :-(
---
Would that not be the definition of sexism?   
---
One song is about murdering men and then lying the cause.
---
One song is about loving his hot tempered one of a kind girl.
---
Yeah I stayed until I was out of ammo
---
Then it's a wrong game for them. It doesn't justify to ruin it for the rest of the players who doesn't cheat.
---
Question . How does someone duping fixers effect you’re gameplay? Is it just a jealousy thing?
---
I’m glad others have shown you kindness in the wasteland! Many ppl have given me free stuff and resources to get me started and I hope those folks know they have saved me for dying in-game countless times. Love that aspect of this community.
---
Weapons and armor that you pickup are often damaged. You can repair those. Also remove the gunsmith perk from your deck so you can repair your main weapon faster.
---
I’ll be needing a break.
---
Armor plated backpack, ironclad, evasive and barbarian could affect that number. Wouldnt worry about it too much. Its just a number. Its the perk cards and sentinel/cav effects that matter more. Just get what you can and keep rolling for better pieces.
---
Secret service armor is the best in the game when it comes to resistant. It’s about 6000-7000 gold bullion in total for the arms legs torso and helmet. I would say it’s worth it but the grind is long. You can earn 200 gold a day by turning in treasury notes at either foundation or crater.
---
I'm like you..I flit in and out of the game whenever I hear there's something new. but it's not easy, the "grind addiction" is a real thing, even if most of us would scoff at that.
---
I've no complaints, I still enjoy the simple exploring and gathering of materials and the occasional wave to my fellow dwellers when the mood strikes... usually after three glasses of wine ;)
---
Eat xp boosting foods like canned meat stew, use a lunchbox if you have any, get very well tested, cranberry relish. Use unyielding armor for extra intelligence, use leader bobbleheads. Farm places like the burrows, West tek, glassed caverns, server hop then go again and again
---
Well for some people they still have to worry to optimize their time spent in the fact that wearing an unyielding set increases your xp gain substantially.
---
Plus the pepperoni rolls you get as reward slap
---
You get treasury notes from some activities, but only after completing the vault raid in wastelanders DLC. 
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Treasury_note
---
You will then trade these notes for bullion.
---
You get up to 200 bullion each day from trading notes for bullion at the gold press machines. One machine is in Foundation, and another is in Crater. You can buy up to 300 bullion each week from Smiley at The Wayward. 
---
You can only hold a maximum of 5000 bullion.
---
Never said it wasn’t. But since we don’t know her background, we can’t be sure. Perhaps she was abused and mistreated by someone, and she has since escaped and is projecting that trauma into the music as a coping mechanism, but isn’t actually a misandrist. 
---
As I said; without more details, no one can say for sure. And there can be multiple potentially valid explanations. 
---
What is your goal with this post and discussion?  Help me understand your own motivations.
---
I found a few tapes referring to her, and when you bring it up, she shuts you down. I also found a tape of her reading to her daughter. Who isn't around now. It was heartbreaking.
---
..and then watch everyone who felt they worked hard for level 50 gear just quit. and then a new dupe 3 weeks later.
---
this shit is just dumb, not clever.
---
I think it'd only work if you could pick from a general list of compliments. A 1-5 star system or something would just be brutal.
---
The top floor is packed with globes, desk fans and typewriters. It's not a secret, though, and others may have looted it before you got there.
---
they havent been rare since December lmao
---
A lot of songs from that area, often used terms like bomb, explosion and such as a stand in for sex and intercourse. Music has a long rich history of that. You can google it and research the whole aspect of songs. Even when they say love, they often meant, making love. 
---
But you couldn't say anything like that at the time. 
---
Most Cole Porter songs have some coded reference to homosexuality. Quite often, Cole would write his songs so that he could make changes on the fly, when performing them at salons and such. So he could make digs at people. 
---
In the version of Anything Goes in the game, there's a line that is a dig at a famous producer that Cole didn't get along with.
---
Great job on these shots. Capturing the beauty in this game. Really love the Overseer desk shot. Keep up the great work!
---
HOW DARE THEY TREAT MAI WAIFU THAT WAY
---
That is perfect.
---
So true and I feel so sorry. You are trying to show these people what can (and must likley will) happen If they are  "Ok" with this.
---
They just trying to see how far they can go. These People saying its easy to kill 3 Legendary a Day - how about 5?.... or 10... what about 100 Legendarys a Week. Still so easy?
---
Note to you people saying this is fine: They are slowly trying to feed you shit and you sit here and telling me it doesnt taste that bad? Its okay If you swollow fast?
---
I really hope Bethesda isnt pushing this or else people lose interested in these challanges and then in the Game alltogether.
---
Sure it was fun. But honestly, I'd like to see more new stuff, that builds the world more than just the old stuff brought back.
---
Not Dailies in the Event/Quest sense. Dailies in the Challenges.
---
Like, ‘Level Up 0/1’. That’s a Daily Challenge for SCORE purposes.
---
it depends. t65 is the tankiest PA. but when compared to something like, say, t51b, in practice, the difference is marginal. like 5 less damage at most. all of that for a ton of gold bullion.
---
in my opinion SH is better. the acid damage is minimal, but more damage never hurts. and the difference between it and t65 is negligible.
---
lmao 1$ fixers incoming
---
It's reddit, one of the biggest crap piles on the internet.  People use bots to downvote everything in a subreddit or everything on every subreddit by a specific poster etc.  Welcome to micro-agression counter culture.
---
there has been 3rd party duping on PC since before the inventory hack, it never went away.
---
Only PvP related cheats effect other players. If I have a modified weapon and I mow down NPCs with it, how is that ruining YOUR experience?
---
Why are you under the impression that it isn’t safe to sell things right now, or even recently?
---
"Please just give me stuff, I don't want to play the game."
---
yeah yeah. I am just jealous as well as i dont want to spend another month with selling option disabled. hope i answered ur question.
---
should say daily SCORE challenge, its confusing.
---
Dw I'd use "Great work!" as a sarcastic way to shit on bad camps. 
---
It'll be just like "nice shot!" in Rocket league
---
Maybe op has been gone for a while? Referring to the dup glitch that had the vendors turned off?
---
"Can people just *not* ya know? Do they cheat in every fuckin game they play or just this one?"
---
Pretty much. If you want to see some crazy cheating go try GTA online. Even super easy games like Minecraft have it. Within a day or the Nether update coming out for Minecraft there were already videos on how to cheat to get Netherite armor in your survival game.
---
That's what I've been doing. I'll do  rep quests when I'm bored and that's about it. I actually don't mind the daily and weekly quests because 80% of them usually go along with my play style. So they really don't feel to grindy.
---
Gotcha. Thanks
---
Oh yeah, didn't even think about that but it is nice. Guess I can throw some of those outfits back in the box.
---
I tend to level up without even really trying. If I don’t get it done by the time the daily’s are finished I just kill a few sentry bots and it does the trick
---
For a long, long, **long** time I used a QE25 double barrel shotgun. It took literal months to realize that it was a level 35. Eventually got a level 45 QE one, and......it was about the same.
---
She doesn't have a background, she's *absolute* fiction.   
---
I love Appalachia radio, love the songs  - don't play the game without being tuned in.  
---
Why though, every 20 minutes does 'Julie' rant about this sExIsT song? My motivations for this post are purely to understand how everyone else interprets her dialogue
---
I remember running into one around the same level and having to bail to. With the hindsight of more play time, because he has radial attacks, he won’t run away like a lot of the other beasties. If you’re set on getting them killed next time, have more ammo and stims at the ready for sure, but try to lead them to an area that you can run around and barricade most of the damage between you and unfortunate tree. Pretty sure his face is not a weak point, so don’t go for headshots either, my plasma/energy weapons work better on him as well. But he is a bit of a tank, when I see one now, I always get out a shotgun and vats his limbs, with my Fancy Shotgun, If can take about ten/fifteen seconds, that’s with no shotgun perks on either.
---
I had some guy with a vendor that was in a locked room, now I love sneaking into people’s locked rooms by entering beds and crafting benches through the windows so I got in after about 5 minutes of jumping and spamming A, he was selling .10 and that’s it
---
the creativity that camps brings out in people is partly what makes me see this game as successful. Have you seen Aqua Nova's videos? 
---
Me and my husband stop be literally every camp, to check it out, and rate it. We love camps that incorporate stuff in game. We came across an Ash Heap Camp that worked in the Wasteland coffee house that is always there. 
---
The best camp based mixing ingame and their own stuff was in Flatwoods, at the end near the Red Rocket. It was built around the building with a broken down pickup truck. I really want to do something there, but I feel I would just be copying. 
---
My camp is built overlapping a perm camp spot south of the Wayward, along the river. I start most sessions with putting my Wasteland Welcome Baskets in the tents. A mixture of themed junk, outfits and supplies. Like a pillow, toothbrush, toothpaste, coffee pot, mug, and more. 
---
It's interesting to see what people take and leave.
---
You should have let them go to your vendor, then shot them in the back. I do the same, but with trading if someone is trying to PVP, and jumping in front of my gun. Teach them not to aggro, and then try to trade.
---
Will there be a patch for glitching challenges? Xbox 1, ie;
---
- no mines crafted appears
---
- diseases I’ve had aren’t credited (sludge lung?) 
---
- locations discovered aren’t showing up (beckley)
---
- tough enemies (scorchbeast queen, legendary Yao Guai)
---
- craft or scrap power armor ... that was a daily challenge this week... 0/76..
---
... to start the list. It’d be cool to actually get those atoms without having to buy them now. =}
---
Less one shotters in events means that there is a higher chance that low level players also gets to tag the legendaries.
---
Millions of duped items affect servers.
---
People duping with player vendors causin vendors to be offline for weeks.
---
Fucking up the economy.
---
Etc.
---
- Starched Genes 2 perk
---
- Strength in Numbers 1 perk
---
- Egghead mutation (+6 Intelligence)
---
- Herd Mentality mutation (+2 all stats while on a team)
---
Join a Public Team. If any of the other members have mutations, Egghead will give you +8 Intelligence and Herd Mentality will give you +3 Intelligence. 
---
That’s +11, or approximately +22.8% XP.
---
See I'm nice. I place mine outside behind the safety of turrets and a protectron. There's big vault boy sign pointing the way and ample lighting.
---
Also I don't price gouge :)
---
My last C.A.M.P. build was a 3 story tower across from Dyer Chemical with the vendor machines at the top. I had arrows on the outside of the building pointing up, and you could see the vendors from the ground. I sold so much in that spot!
---
It’s a waste....an unarmed scorched would tear through him anyway.
---
Use the weapon with highest single shot dmg to deal with it, blank minigun’s dmg is ridiculous becoz Sheepsquatch dmg resistance is high
---
Delete his radio and then place it again. He'll give you a different quest. You really want the one that gives a random legendary
---
No because I play as always. Explore and wander around and daily events complete themselves
---
Congrats! I don't think you cheated. If you buff up, getting that 10,000 bonus isn't that hard. I saw someone that managed to get it so that he got 1,000 xp for each high level kill. Which means every ten kills, 100 score. So yeah, not cheating.
---
Oh, just wait until you've earned that rep and then realized the rewards don't come close to compensating for your effort. They ARE cool, really, but after all that work you earn the right to *buy* something.
---
Honestly yeah. It’ll take quite a grind to get, but it’s well worth it. Plus you’re also going to want to get the buttressed armor mods for it as well. 
---
The armor is pretty much just as good as standard power armor from my understanding and looks really cool. Now I wouldn’t worry about the helmet though. I’ve read it looks cool, but it’s really overpriced and has no effect.
---
Yeah, the hunting rifle has like 5 paint options now.
---
Aside from the one or two days where they wanted you to revive people or something, they don't even require you seeing another player.
---
How do you fail taking a picture?  You get that done in the gathering room.
---
Moving a camp 3 times?  30 seconds after spawning and you're done.
---
I did the stimpacks without ever seeing another player and hurting myself jumping off things.
---
I did the kill 9 without seeing anyone.
---
A lot of games it's 15 minutes of wandering around before I even see someone.  The maps is retardedly oversized for the number of players.
---
You should've killed him. PVP is individual based now, not team based.
---
That implies there are other sorts of daily challenges. There aren't.
---
I have a high tension tower camp.  Vendors are on the ground floor, under the tower in the open.  With blinking Vault lights over the top.  I never understood why some seem to hide their machines.
---
Fictional characters have backgrounds if their creators build and design them. Your comment is completely illogical. 
---
Why does she rant every twenty minutes?  
---
Because they only have enough music and Julie dialogue to fill 20 minutes and it’s on a loop. 
---
That’s why. 
---
Weird, i guess 70 years later i just couldn't see it.  
---
Anything to say about women who murder men and lie about it though?
---
maybe their caps almost full, check in tomorrow after they buy gold bullion
---
Probably Bethesda Corporate CYA. In today’s world it’s hard to predict what will create outrage and retaliation.
---
This game is insane
---
sounds terrible for lvl 78. do u have all +20%damage perks equiped? check them out. i can suggest u
---
1. ask for help to any high-lvl player
---
2. play in  stealth mode if u r sneak player but not with minigun and especialy not a shotgun. any range weapon with suppressor is good if u have perks. do some shots and go away or get a higher unreachable position and bam bam bam.
---
Maybe but then why would OP mention ‘some’ vendors still turned on?
---
When that was occurring, all player vending was disabled. It wasn’t optional. So no player camps would show as vendor-ready.
---
events with lots of enemies (events in general) . Line in the sand. abandoned bog town enclave event. distant thunder. heart of the swamp. blah blah
---
Super mutants, ghouls and scorched give good xp. Westek, charleston capitol building, glassed caverns.
---
Just took me about 20 seconds to do distant thunder and i probably got about 2k xp. Don't have any xp buffs on.
---
And horde events. Do NOT kill the boss and when you clear all the other enemies more will turn up and they will be higher level. Also a good way to get legendaries.
---
Since they don't have text chat, and honestly, if you don't have a keyboard, texting on a consul is very tedious. 
---
I wish they would put in an option that allows me to type a message, then put it on the emote wheel. When I use it, it pops up over my head like a word balloon in  a comic.
---
I haven’t gotten anywhere near NW, have been playing entirely solo in a private world and I’m at 32 on the board. I expect to complete the board and use 0 atoms.  Don’t get discouraged.
---
I know this isn't a low level story but I offered to make a level 60 a jet pack for his X01 the other day and when he got to my camp I decided I didn't want to log out and move flux between characters. So I gave him my spare fully modded set of X01. Jet pack, targeting hud, calibrated shocks, tesla Bracers, and quantum paint. I think I made his day.
---
Okay well atm I've gone through the heist and im on the i an become death mission rn with excavator pa cuz if the extra carry weight but tyy
---
Keep building. Steal other people's ideas or as I say: "take influence" from other people's camp ideas. You'll have to find work arounds for things you find too difficult to copy or will end up choosing to do some aspects differently cuz of the landscape of ur camp area. My houses were basically glorified squares too, but I've been playing since beta and have had dozens and dozens of camp styles. Building from already broken buildings in game, farm camps, home-y camps, outdoor bar/music camps, hell I even had a Collectors museum for awhile where it was basically just a big.building with tons upon tons of all the various unique collectibles you can find displayed. (I shut it down cuz of budget issues with that many display items and I couldnt have a farm or much else besides a vendor(gift shop) and a couple crafting benches lol). 
---
I still don't build crazy aesthetically designed buildings, but I've come a long ways from beta days with my giant squares.
---
Any suggestions on a cheap to repare weapon I could run around with? Asking for a friend.
---
Well seeing as how the reddit karma court judged me into the negatives I guess that plain black skin IS content. Silly me I thought stuff like legendary perks and the new boss were content. Guess I better go down to the content store and buy more content then ;)
---
Also what's up with no mini gun skin? My wallet was ready to get one and all that was there was the plain black skin haha.
---
Thank you for the replies:)
---
well they will have to do something because otherwise why even log in unless there are challenges or an event going
---
Current CAMP is a Slocum’s Joe laid out like a Waffle House. Vendors are all the new robots. 
---
My previous CAMP was a bat/lounge. It had a room labeled “shop” with my vendors in it. 
---
Whenever I go to those camps with hard to find vendors, part of me is like, screw em. If they won’t make it easy to find, they don’t get my business. The other part of me keeps looking because maybe they will have something I actually want. They never do.
---
Yep its been days now, think the grind is sooo extreme (is it worth it? Especially knowing the content will be released later anyway. Cosmetic items really worth obsessive grind?)
---
Ok. Thank you.
---
I don’t think that’s quite true.
---
Having a coherent conversation before a cup of coffee is a daily challenge for me, my friend.
---
The grind is trivial.  You get over half your notes just doing the daily rep which takes a few minutes.
---
It's just the ridiculously long time you have to wait due to only being able to turn in 20 notes a day.
---
Coolest thing I see on there for base building if you're going for raider design is the tree with the cage, as for the UFO...I just unlocked it and I'm not sure I'll use it doesn't really fit my build :/
---
yeah kinda irritating when i get 8k xp from a NW round and it just rolls over the 10k mark.
---
I think any melee weapon like a machete or baseball bat should be cheap enough to repair for any budget.
---
Radiation Rumble - whether or not anyone else shows up to help you, you'll get at least a level just going there and killing all the ghouls yourself.
---
Project Paradise - same, whether anyone else helps you, plenty of high-level mobs to get xp from.
---
The Burrows, Westek, and Harpers Ferry are good places, too.
---
Bonus - while you're in The Burrows, pick the Gut Shrooms, 30 minutes of 10% XP from Gut Shroom Soup.
---
I didn't say vendor bots, my bad that's was different post sorry about that.
---
Then why has her background been so limited? Why do we not know more about her to justify her views?  
---
Seriously i don't see how i'm the only one who cringes when she carries on about atom bomb baby
---
We need a "read the event prompt!" emote so the dumb dumbs can completely ignore that too and we can once again fail the event.
---
I always imagine that they've been playing GTA Online before coming here and they're like beaten dogs who don't trust anymore because they're so used to being shot on sight lol. They'll eventually come around.
---
i think it may be based on player level? not sure, but i think mine's been at 40 caps per move since i passed level 100.
---
Totally agree there buddy but in the context of the game there really isn't. It's just asking you to do the other things on the list it is part of, I really can't understand the confusion. Even without coffee.
---
I do the same thing. I now have 3 pieces of troubleshooters SS armor added it. With the rad resistance I'm able to fix the pipes in the silo without a haz mat suit. Just pop a rad x and a radaway or 2.
---
bcz bethesda can ban ur account if somehow ur vending machine was used. i dont know how exactly this cheat works and i dont want to know. based on some topics here i have suggestion that they could use any vending machine. responding with another question is not a good thing.
---
Worth pointing out, the Raiders are not all crazed murderers. Their conversations indicate that a good portion of them (including the leadership) kill as needed but are more focused on taking what they need instead of trying to bargain for it. It's group focused, just like the Settlers, but where the Settlers are willing to lie and cheat and, through Ward, kill to get what they need, raiders are willing to lie, cheat, and kill without using Ward as a scapegoat. Many of them speak about having nightmares about what has happened, missing family, and other completely normal human emotions.
---
I point this out not to say the raiders are morally better or worse, but that your call to "shoot on sight" places your moral standing below both factions. They generally kill to fulfill material needs for survival. You kill because of their political alignment, without any evidence that they are killers themselves but just because they associate with them. By that argument, every Settler should be shot on sight for their complacency with Ward, who is literally still a raider, just with a different title and political group.
---
Things like lucky mucker, cop a squatter, etc are labeled as "daily"
---
And btw, you dont have to wait until it is fully broke to repair it. As long that there is a dent in the condition bar you can repair it and it will count.
---
Because she’s a new character and not important to the story so far.  She may never be important to the story. She’s ‘background noise’. She’s ‘flavor text’.
---
I’m perplexed that you cringe over what a fictional character says or does. I don’t have sympathy for that situation.
---
im sure they will stop because you asked.
---
this is just circlejerk karma farm lmao
---
Not player vendors, Vendor bots. I forgot to mention that.
---
Meh, they're still less annoying that Commander Daguerre and the Fasnacht Collectron alternating dumb lines.
---
Ok Thanks!
---
That’s cool. Have a great day.
---
The dupe glitch you seem to be referring to has **nothing** to do with player owned vending machines. It has to do with NPC/Robot Vendors.
---
If we are ignoring Bullet Shield 3\*, +50DR w/ Aiming legendary modifier, and +250DR w/ reloading legendary modifier then the max would be 773 DR.   
---
327 (full Buttressed SS armor)  
---
175 (5x Vanguards effect at full health)  
---
80 (Barbarian 3\* at 15 Strength)  
---
50 (Ironclad 5\*)  
---
45 (Evasive 3\* at 15 Agility)  
---
30 (Junk Shield 3\* + junk)  
---
36 (Bodyguards 4\* + 3 teammates)  
---
30 (Mirelurk jerky + Carnivore)  
---
If I am forgetting something or my early morning math is wrong let me know. Either way, while 773 DR sounds impressive it is not as it seems because resistances in fallout games are not linear but rather a curve. This means that you get less actual protection increase per DR the higher you go. Damage % perks and effects are actually better at protecting you because they are % based and do not suffer diminishing returns, only caps at the extremes.
---
Complaining is good for the soul. Better to have a grumble and feel better than to let all the faults eat at you inside. It's also important to remember that despite what the internet demands, there are opinions between "this thing is perfect" and "this thing is the devil himself". I enjoy playing the game a lot, but it is also a buggy chore. I have the maximum 5 characters on both Xbox and PC.
---
I think it's way too easy. I prefer Radiation Rumble, with a team who knows how to do it properly it's a real hoot.
---
I really didnt understand u. It is possibe to sell items from ur stash no matter what (at least for now).
---
I often wonder about this. How come dogs, chickens, rabbits and squirrels survived, but horses and pigs didn’t?
---
Yeah but also, Bethesda is inacapable.
---
Use 3 of the 1 star cards for a 30 percent boost, rather then upgrade 1 card for a 20 percent boost.
---
If you have it, put The Enforcer perk on when you fight the Sheepsquatch. He's easy to cripple with a shotgun, and it will give you time to freely attack him while he's getting back up. Shoot it in the face and around the horns, seems to do the most damage there.
---
Because when that dupe was still going, people’s camps would still show on the map as long as they me we disconnected power to their vendors.
---
I made my CAMP like a weird hillside commune that does illegal experimenting on people, near Crater. At least that’s sort of the feel when you approach on a certain angle. Luckily if you FT to my camp, you spawn in front of my store. 
---
The store usually has music and smoke pouring out of it, with bright lights, and balloons to catch your eyes. The store is generally always open, but there is a as kill switch that is clearly marked. It will turn off the vending machines and close the garage door. One might think they’ve been trapped in my store if that happens, but there is a hidden passage out, that should only take a little effort to find. None of my doors are locked, because what’s the point. 
---
My own personal note: I keep refreshments stocked for my guests. Some jerks will empty out my Nuka-Cola machine and then use the caps in my store... thanks I guess. But no one thinks to try the punch bowl! I make sure that bad boy is filled with Hard Lemonade, that no one ever tries. I also do judge people that have the bowl laid out and it’s empty.
---
Honestly, same here. The first time I saw this question, I though they might have had a bug. 
---
When the text is read in context (You’re in the **Challenges** section, and you’re in the **Daily** subsection), it’s blatantly obvious what that one means.
---
mine is right infront of my house right where you spawn
---
Agreed. I felt so bad because I was jumping around to other player's camps to see if they had vegetable starch items. 10 was a bit much if you ask me.
---
I have a bar and sell the alcohol recipes, I wonder if this will effect business. I counted on those challenge and the people who gave up on Biv.
---
I’m on PC and I’m sure I have a mounted glowing one plan left over ... I’m at work now but will be around in the afternoon/evening EST ... hit me up here or pop into Discord and find me there (invite.gg/TRP) and I can hook you up.
---
She doesn't outright call it sexist, what she says about the song is "i mean I'm sure they meant well but idk comparing your girl to a weapon of mass destruction. . .i mean you get what I'm saying right?"
---
as for "i didn't know the gun was loaded" what she's laughing at is the sound of the gunshot in the song and how ridiculous the song itself is.
---
Also to be fair these songs were made in the 1950's so they're not exactly "PC"
---
okk.thnx
---
Returns to Jerrycare several minutes later. Haha
---
I don’t recall that being the case, but I’ll concede that may be accurate. 
---
However, OP has now clarified they are worried about the current dupe, which has nothing to do with player vendors. 
---
If OP has been more forthcoming with the reason for their concern, it would have been a one-reply thread.
---
70 years later, songs actually say it, rather than imply it. So of course you are used to people saying it plain and simple. 
---
The song, I Didn't Know the Gun Was Loaded, was written by Hank Fort and Herb Leventhal, so it's written from a man's point of view. And in the end, the main character of the song is killed by another women using the same excuse, that she's just a women, and doesn't understand how things like guns work. 
---
It's song by Patsy Montana.
---
No, it’s not.
---
Same tho 😂
---
Speaking of showers the people who open doors and don't shut them will also turn on the shower and then not shut it off\~
---
I watched a YouTube video where a guy got plans and afterwards legendary enemies started dropping legendary Fixers at events and stuff. Sounds pretty awesome
---
You made me so happy that you got that reference!
---
I did a super mutant horde event, which gave me one daily, then I repaired all the weapons I got for another. Managed to level up, and the leader of the horde was a legendary, giving me dailies theee and four. There was another easy one, that gave me enough for my gold star. Got a couple of weeklies and advanced three spaces.
---
Whoa! Thanks. Perks it is...amazing amount of data there.
---
IMO levelling up should be moved to weekly challanges. Besides the current level up 3x, there should be another to level up 7x. This way we can for example do the levelling on weekend and do only the small challanges on work days. It would also help with the sour feeling when we level up 2x in a day by accident.
---
Yeah true, but it’s not hard to understand why people tends to prefer bloodied unyielding build. A friend of mine and I started the legendary challenge at the exactly same time on the same day. Now he is rank 34 and I just got rank 30 and he’s bloodied unyielding build whereas I’m not.
---
K
---
Buy the ATX skins for our underwhelming PA guy.
---
I literally read your comment in her voice instinctively. Haha
---
Not sure. Players may still give up on Biv and buy them just do they know the recipes.
---
limits exist for a reason and it's not a new thing for games to have a cap on currencies
---
Its not about challenges, its about ppl leaving early because of challenges and increasing number of certain things to do doing little job.
---
You're still getting those XP points. It's tied to your account, not your characters. My main character is about 60 levels above my next most used character, except the lower level has higher intelligence and actually would gain more xp points on average.
---
why?
---
Yep. I've got that on all pieces except dense on chest
---
It has worked for me, I had tried it before but it is seen that if you do not put it only in reading the game deletes it. Thank you very much.
---
Thanks a whole lot. I’ll definitely come back with round 3 of these!
---
That’s one of my own favorites as well ;)
---
Is that the one that guarantees a pie basically? Cheats and lies, the only true joy can come from regular super low chance port a diner!
---
that's pretty exactly my findings to I always place the camp where I want it build and then moves the camp unit all the way over to the edge so that when I spawn man that's kind of close to center however where you spawn is not always the same as where other people spawn
---
I like them this way.  It makes more sense.  I rather think that an army combat robot *should* be pretty feisty, otherwise what's the point?
---
On the other hand, the liberators were dropped on the U.S. with the intention of spreading pro-communist propogands, so why are they programmed to attack everything on sight?  I mean what is the purpose of the leaflets, are they supposed to drop them on the corpse after they kill a motherfucker?  Seems like the Chinese were not exactly masters at winning hearts and minds.
---
Yep. That oughta stop them.
---
If you’re hinting at the fact that you didn’t dupe the weapons but were given duped weapons then my point still stands. If you were to legitimately get weapons with the exact same 3 star legendary effects it would take you thousands of hours to get.
---
Real kick in the gut when you talk to Ward and it says "This individual is busy" then plays a killer bass riff
---
Yeah I’ve noticed there are a lot of new players since the game came to Game Pass. I hope they stick around.
---
Cranberry cobbler, some canned meat stew, an INT boosting underarmor, and the Inspirational perk while in a building team is a way easier way to boost xp earning potential without a lot of work
---
This works for me. As someone that's had months of problems with pso2 and the MS store this shit comes as no surpise. I really don't understand how they've fucked integration of so many games.
---
That wasn't too bad in all honesty. Weapons that mobs drop are often damaged so I just picked those up and repaired them. Scrapped them after too so I could get something back.
---
It counts towards some atom challenges too if you haven't completed them, so there's always that.
---
herd mentality works solo in a party and yes to food buffs
---
and class freak 3 can give you no negative effects from herd mentality.
---
What are people doing in this game if you can't get a simple level up? I run around for a couple of hours with my friends, doing events and some dailies and I get at least one, if not two levels ups just by \*gasp\*, playing this game. Sure, I take well-rested and eat cranberry foods, but that's not even big of an effort to boost the XP gain. And I'm level 320+.
---
**Are you serious?**
---
No one can currently access the contents of your stash through your vending machines, other than the items that are for sale in the machines. 
---
You ask if it’s safe and when people tell you it is you keep questioning it?
---
Go do your own research then. Stop wasting people’s time arguing with them or contradicting them after they’ve answered your question.
---
The helmet appears to come with all mod options included
---
What i like about score is that after an 8 hour shift, i come back home to do my chores and then fo76 reminds me my day isnt over and i have more chores to complete before i go to bed. It is awesome really.
---
They're quests.
---
Cool, any tips on what I should get?
---
Doesn’t really fit with anyone’s build, or available building pieces. I’m confused as to why they thought it’d be desirable. Only use I’ve seen of it so far that sort of works, was outside a player’s Slocum Joe’s Diner.
---
I honestly think there is a silver lining to all of this, now someone doesn’t need to trade half their inventory for one gun, and makes the more fun and enjoyable weapons more available to everyone, that way there isn’t a select few players that are incredibly overpowered and lord it over everyone else. Ironically, to quote Snydrome from the Incredibles “When everyone is super, then no one will be” and I honestly think that describes the current situation very well and hopes this eventually balances out the economy and therefore makes everyone more equal
---
It was a weekly atom challenge. Wouldn't surprise me to see it, or a variation, in the SCORE challenges. I dont think I'll scrap my brewing station just yet!
---
But I hope its not as awful.
---
That's why I always try to start a farm on my characters and leave it accessible. Heck if I'm not at my camp why not let others have my veggies and purified water.
---
I had given up on the old level up daily. It was such nonsense. Loving the new one. Level up, just do it.
---
You will have all the mods so vats overlay, targeting hud or sensor array would all be fine
---
I can’t scrap my brewing station no matter what!  **I need my Whiskey!!**
---
*For Grape Mentats... that’s all*
---
Agreed. Not liking a part of the game is no justification for cheats, exploits or dupes. Do you dislike grinding, Nuclear Winter or some event? Then don't do it, but also accept that you won't the associated rewards.
---
I didn't like the Vault 94 "raids" so I didn't do them and accepted that I won't get the PA rewards. And moved on. I didn't go out of my way to cheat/exploit/dupe to get those rewards, because I somehow feel entitled to them.
---
Look folks, I don't defend excessive grinds or badly designed systems, but the fact is that they are the legitimate ways to obtain certain things. If we don't like them, it doesn't give us any rights to use illegitimate ways.
---
You're not being constructive though. This post is extremely short and is just a vague complaint. You're bored? Buy another video game, support the industry!!
---
Uggg this! The amount of time i missed out on those 10 atoms because i forgot to wear sunglasses or some shit .....
---
I've taken to sharing magnetic personality since I have it at max. A full public team and everyone gets +6 Cha!
---
I see what you're saying. I just encountered another one of my other characters and it really was way tankier. I was using a Junkie's Gauss Minigun and with another dude using  unarmed melee. It probably took a little over 10 minutes and over thousands of rounds of 2mm EC ammo. Instead of only having to deal with two wendigo spawns there were a total of over 20 that spawned over the course of the fight. I did get a Junkie's handmade out of it, but only a 1 star :-/
---
When im in doubt, i go on YouTube to see if CaptaiNoob has tested the weapon. He tests alot so it might help you. Also Angryyturtle, but his tests is more detailed and he dont have as many done. Hope this is helpful
---
Thank you
---
I'm glad to hear it!
---
Yes. The difference between a daily quest and a daily challenge is where the confusion comes from. I used to log on to do my "daily's" English speakers normally need that adjective to not abbreviate it out of context.
---
Unplugging the vendor from a power source does not prevent sales from the machine to a player. You have to either untag all the for sale items, or store the machine.
---
Eeehhh. I had felt that way. The repeatable xp challenge got me back into grinding xp. I’m enjoying that at the moment, won’t last though. The game is HOPPIN on Xbox right now because of Gamepass, so we’ve had fun just helping new players.
---
Make a perk card for it like the find bobble head perk
---
I got tired of chasing low levels so I setup my camp between the Wayward and the first few missions and have a vendor setup to sell low level gear for 1-10 caps. Even put in BoS recon rifles and low level fixers for them also.
---
On my junkie char, i still run unyielding armor but usually sit around 50% health
---
Ah, a committed role player!  
---
How does your team motto go?  Ah, yes, *Ad Nauseam!*

Again. So I push past potted plants to get on ledge, the vendors are on a ledge across a ravine. Not gonna survive a fall, so I put on my PA, struggle to get black up on rhe ledge through the potted plants, make the jump...
---
The 7 weapons were all knuckles, 7 caps each. The armor was 11 like,  military garb or some shit.
---
Vectrix11, that was time I will never get back, you bridge troll.
---
Wrong sub
---
I don't trust devs at all so we'll see.
---
I pretty much gave up on those. Stupid clown suit wearing wendigo killing.
---
*Shhhh!  He doesn’t like spoilers.*
---
Or advice, it seems.
---
Folks need to learn some constructive criticism techniques. Instead of saying the  game sucks and is boring, identify what it is that's boring and try to suggest in a few words how it could change.
---
This but then I also need to do my animal crossing daily’s.
---
The challenge says to do daily challenges. Not quests. Challenges.
---
I love this...
---
This worked for me but after the game closes it seems to remove the .ini file from "My Games\\Fallout 76" and needs to be copied back there each time i want to launch it.  
---
Edit: it also needs to be set to read only or it will be removed from the folder on launch and recreate the error.
---
IIRC, patch 22 in Winter, according to the roadmap that’s been out for over a month and about a dozen threads in this sub.
---
Yes, lots of vending going on.  Sell away.
---
Dodgy can save you from getting one shotted... if you have ap
---
Anything goes on pc and they’ll never have the resources to do anything about it
---
Oh, and don’t put a stash box near the vending machines, just in case
---
Maybe have an escort mission along the river near the Ohio River Adventures. You have to escort raiders on a boat down the that long river.  Mirelurks and bugs attacking you throughout it and at the end you have to bust through a Blood Eagle barricade or something.
---
The only people not getting shot are the ones not engaging
---
This isn’t talked about enough. Everyone complains about the score challenges but I haven’t had to kill an albino deathclaw while naked in a nuke zone while another player takes a drunk picture yet. Seriously these are all pretty easy. I do dislike some of the NW ones because the wait times to get in a match can be long and your not guaranteed to get them done first time around. Other than that they’re pretty simple and usually can be completed in an hour or two, which is usually the amount of time I play.
---
Going to try this Sunday, not worked so far, or Monday.
---
"Come back Monday" 😡
---
Pipe guns, I have some if you’re on Xbox I could mod and give you
---
This dupe doesn’t even use player vendors so why would they shut them down ?
---
GT?
---
My alt has all the chems you need for cheap
---
I know that pissed me off so much more than anything else😂
---
I have more than 300 repair kits from doing SBQ runs. They keep adding up more than what I can use. Normally I would use them only on expensive to repair weapons like the plasma caster which require fiber optics. 
---
Using repair kits work for the repair challenges.
---
Funny, on PS4 I’m still not getting any benefits from Herd Mentality when solo in a public group

[Not a support ticket, it's an article on Bethesda.net](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/50733/kw/smiley%C2%A0might)
---
Actually a great idea
---
Never cheated on this game, but this makes me want to now.
---
I get it, you get it. Many don't. This is the why. Why can't people take the pylons? Etc.
---
Last time I've heard from your Guys was from a psychotic TV that killed all of its members correct.
---
This Circus is trying to sell Mutations to People and calling themselfs the remains United States of America?
---
For this very reason is why we fight - keeping technology from eggheads and abominations like yourself. 
---
PS: no hate mate much love. Hope you guys get some care in forms of Camp items and future DLC.
---
It will not take minutes. Maybe 3 or 4 hours at the fastest but not minutes. The amount of XP you need to reach 100 from the repeatable Xp challenge is equivalent to gaining over 300 lvls. Against popular opinion I did the glitch a few months back and it took my 2.5 hours to gain 100 levels. The game starts running into serious lag issues while running this glitch. Yeah it’s still fucked up that someone can complete it in a day maybe but not in just a few minutes
---
Lol i feel that. I've never been asked why i chose my spot, but I'll be damned if people don't hate me for it.
---
If we had displays I would be the same way. I have 3 or 4 sets but I dont use PA so I don’t bother making more. With all the skins we have they need displays. In FO4 I made a warehouse just to display them all.
---
True but they're still annoying...
---
Normally if they naked, head missing then they broken.... Moths though they just kinda just sit there idle, makes for good selfys xD
---
If you don't usually use them much, you can also burn a few of those repair kits from the SBQ to make that daily next time it shows up.  It was a bit tough at first for my high luck character to get that one.  Nearly all of the weapons on the corpses I kill or in vendor bots are over-repaired. The trick is to pick up the ones they drop on the ground when you kill them, or the second item on the crowned enemies.  For some reason, the high luck doesn't affect those so they will always be highly degraded.
---
Gold Star: = the number of other challenges inc the NW one in the list completed, it will update accordingly.
---
Confused the hell out of me too.
---
1st does offer some decent benefits like $180 in free atoms a year and the ability to pick through a dungeon without someone getting to the good stuff first. And that scrap box ain’t too shabby.
---
Winter 2020
---
Agree. I’ve played more lately because of the challenges but once the dailies are done I’m bored. To be able to constantly earn points, even if minimal, would keep me playing longer.
---
Dude this is spectacular. The community for this game always brings me a smile.
---
mine is rammadeus.
---
camp is near the rusty pick. i'll be in a building team if you want to join that
---
Yeah I got one from a machine after a couple of years.  So much more satisfying than the 500 I got from the spawn. Why on earth would they keep a spawn of it in the game? Bethesda makes me scratch my head sometimes.
---
I use the junk/lead location by Crater. You can see my vendor literally from the point you fast travel in. Luckily my camp seems to only have one day travel point
---
They're tough but i have more trouble with mirelurks as a rule. Last night i got killed like ten times by two mirelurk kings and it's the closest I ever came to logging off in frustration.
---
Head to Big Al's Tattoo Parlour , theres an addictol under the desk in the main room , usually spawns there
---
Add a NW repeatable and I am in.
---
Maybe 100 S.C.O.R.E. for every 5 matches, since the XP repeatable doesn't work with NW?
---
I’m running full secret service armor, so maybe it’s tied to that specifically? I should have given more context to that in the original post. It’s good to know it is working in some places, so I’ll have to find some different armor (scout, steel) and test
---
Joining
---
nice. And a 3* Queen at the end.
---
I disagree.... Kill 9 creatures in nuclear winter was horrid.... Some times non spawn some times team mates kill everything :(
---
Then these the forcing people to play it just to get score...
---
If score wasn't so limited then I'd understand but jesus I'm doing more shit then I was doing for atoms but am getting less....

P.S. No Hate, Mate!  Thanks for being a good sport. Stay safe in the Wasteland!
---
And agility for the perk.... Interesting thanks didn't know that.
---
“Winter”. When in those months that are winter, who knows.
---
UPDATE:  Beckett daily working every day now
---
Probably because of the raiders reputation glitch and it's still working.
---
This is my point exactly.  Do a build, but use whatever perks make the game more enjoyable for YOU.  Don't be a follower and rely on the status quo.  Experiment.
---
Recently got a IE25 Hunting Rifle from the Queen, now I'm rocking that bad boy every day just because of the skin :D
---
Exactly. I looked at that challenge and then Line in the Sand popped. I just did the event and picked up 10 light melee weapons off Scorched and repaired them.
---
There are camo options for some guns which is better anyway.
---
Idk
---
the reason some people make their shops take some effort to find is the previous exploit regarding accessing stash through a vendor if the camp had not loaded fully yet.
---
I shall sent a friend request today. Mine is coco_antiques
---
The only insane thing is denying the Mothman as your true god.
---
Best part is I can trigger it when I feel like it rather than server hop over and over to find it.
---
Most probably early 2021. February is my bet
---
Thank you. He will reward you for your sacrifice.
---
Worth it.  I'm still buying mods for mine (buttressed, etc), but even with just the armor itself, and jetpack mod, my general play has become easier and more fun.  And I'll never never never go back to normal jumps - the jetpack is awesome.
---
But yes, as others said, 200 a day through treasury notes and 300 a week from Smiley.  The seasonal game board has a few buillion drops as well, but not huge amounts.
---
I fought tons of them, I am saying those guys are harder to kill than assaultrons that’s for sure
---
You sure it just wasn’t suppressed for an hour? If you took a Rad-X accidentally it can suppress it.

You are kicking ass to even keep it that close.

As some one who does the nw challenges who hates pvp, I’m much more likely to be a tourist when you make them hard. For example, lockpick three times? I now know where the one safe is I think I can reach and I don’t want to play 3 full games of NW so I’m going to quit after finding it so I can start again. Make me do it once and I might play out the match for the hell of it cause I don’t feel pressured that I need to get my daily done.  Make me do 6 stimpacks, same thing... if I had to do one I might just harm myself a little and then try to survive. With 6 I’m going to find as many as I can quickly before I get found by a player (cause for me I suck at pvp so being found = instant death) and then throw myself into the fire. If I’m lucky I’ll find 6, if not do it all over again.
---
But honestly the solution to this is not to have an NW challenge or make it so it is not necessary to complete seasons, it is just extra score that levels you up quicker. There is no reason why people who hate pvp should be made to play NW just to finish seasons. And don’t give me that grind xp excuse, it’s a lot more work (usually) to grind xp than go into nw. And notice I said work. A game shouldn’t be work.
---
I think bone club/hammers only require bones to repair.
---
Just started messing with junkies and full health on my commando main and am really shocked by how much less damage I do, how much more resources (bullets plus weapon repair), so much less xp, and the huge difference in prices. I knew it would be worse, but it's crazy. The damage part would be more tolerable if adrenaline wasn't broken.
---
Shame because I got some decent SS armor rolls for a high health build. Super tanky at least.
---
Radiation Rumble is shit design because you run ore you get no XP, loot or legendaries.
---
You shoot ghouls you get a billion trillion XP and tons of random loot and multiple legendaries.
---
Really sours people on an event when you do the work, you burn the radaway, and you're the one that gets shafted.
---
This seems far more likely.
---
bloodied can do 10000 damage in a hit. As a junkies i could do that fairly quick as well. the 100 creatures would take next to no time as well. 
---
it would have to be a lot higher to be a repeatable.
---
You did *events.*  Daily SCORE *challenges* are a different thing.
---
*My imbibing chamber is empty!*
---
Give it time
---
Waiting for the record group; I’m ready.
---
Nope. I did Daily Challenges. I do know the difference between events and challenges
---
&gt; Well that would be because one achievement has been in the game since launch
---
I wish I had a dollar for everyone who said this completely pointless statement. Both were in the game at the same time when it launched on Steam, which the title clearly specifies. And it's shocking how many heads the joke of this thread goes over.
---
Page doesn't seem to exist, same error.
---
Yep, had this happen to me before. I asked if there could be a CND bar like in the old fallout games placed somewhere with a photoshopped a year ago, a CM replied "passing this on" and nothing was done at all. The real question I personally have is, Who TF was in charge of Weapon Implementation?
---
I repaired everything in my arsenal to 200% with weapon artisan a couple of days ago!! Luckily my armour was in bits.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no.  It is a not a great difference in real world protection.
---
And yes, I have the T-65.  Use your gold on something else and get the T-65 later.
---
Awesome feedback thanks!

Here’s what I did. Level 1 board, put Brahmin in camp, kill Brahmin, repair (1 wood, 1 adhesive) Rinse and repeat
---
I live in Ohio and have been to the Mothman Festival. I've even been to the location where he was first seen. TNT Area which is now a State Wildlife Area. Old pillbox style bunkers with giant steel doors littered through the property that were once there to hold TNT during WWII. Some still are filled with leaking Nitroglycerin. 
---
The place is pretty... odd. 
---
So yes, I'm in.
---
Does choosing either side really matter or change anything later?  Or just which side do you want the bigger boost?

Excellent choice. His covers are fantastic!

Do you have picture??!?!?! We need to see them. 
---
And you are welcome any day. He knows you are a true believer.
---
Thanks for the update. Been a couple weeks since I last played
---
is there a shortcut key or something I don't know about to take photos..? Everytime I come across a cool situation I go into the map and figure out anew how to enter the mode and...blah...the opportunity for a good shot is gone :(
---
Good point ill will check.
---
I just spent caps traveling to vendors like this. Game value list a plan at 250, they’re selling for 200. Meanwhile, I go to another vendor the other day and picked up some needed plans for around 25-50 caps apiece. I’d rather give another player 1000 caps for plans than to spend 50-100 hopping from vendor to vendor finding good deals.
---
Ok, thanks. I’ve seen it in the roadmap but I thought someone from pts would have a *newer* update. Also, I don’t look at the subs enough to know that people have made a dozen threads about it already.
---
Delete.  FREEEEEEEDOM!
---
I'm sad i missed the eye patch. I could run around looking like OG Nick Fury
---
You’re fucking up the economy, outfits that were extremely rare and hard to get like the BOS jumpsuit now it’s worth jack shit cause of people like you, it just sits in my stash. You’re not entitled to shit, BSG doesn’t owe you anything. Yes you’re fucking up my experience because you cheating causes them to take down the vendors and the vendors is how I make my caps so yea technically you are ruining my experience. Stop being such a sore loser
---
Exactly, there isn’t much that makes me pause and have to strategize an attack, deathclaw-no problem, pack of Yao guis- no sweat, Scorchbeast- easy, Sheepsquatch- hold my beer, behemoth- watch this. I don’t even run a refined build or use any mutations. Only Mirelurk kings, assultatrons, and gutsy make me stop and think of the best way to deal. There should be more wasteland creatures that you’ve got to be worried about.
---
Totally normal and rational actually - if you don't like grinds to the extent these seasons represent, there's no harm stepping away for a while.  Personally, at 250 hours, I'm putting the game aside after this season, probably to play Cyberpunk 2077 and going back to Destiny 2 once the Fall DLC drops.  I'll return once Fallout 76 gets more actual  content/story material in a year or so.  It is an amazing game when it is story and real content involved.... not so much with repeatable grind tasks.
---
There's nothing wrong in recognizing what aspects of Fallout 76 works for individual playing styles.  I doubt Bethesda really expects all of its players to be on 365 days a year.  And if they do, well, that's on them for misjudging what their player base is.
---
If you were an herbivore you could eat brain fungus soup and cranberry relish. They won't cancel each other out. You can also use Berry mentats even though that's not a food.
---
Brain bombs or brain fungus soup gives int buff which will give you more xp % if you get strange in number perk will add 5% on to tasty squirrel if you have the carnivore mutation.
---
This is news to me and I've been playing for over a year lmao I have a lot to learn
---
Ah you mean like that leader bobble head thing ? Or is that something different
---
Overall I’ve really enjoyed the game and it’s progress.  I bought it pre beta and it’s pretty much the only game I play on a daily basis.  I’m only level 182 on my main and 50 on my alt.  I enjoyed wastelanders but now that I’ve got ally for both factions it was nice to have this thrown in.  The gold runs were getting tedious.
---
Unless you have high luck, then... little harder.
---
I'm on level 34 at the moment.
---
That's what I did. I had over 40 of them in my stash so I just used those to get the challenge done.
---
Morgantown airport or the jail will get you 10 repairable guns really quick and easy.  They only have to be slightly damaged (and they always are) for the fix to work.
---
Yea i would go herbivour with cranberry relish. I didnt even think about buff to the brain fungus. I dont no a carnivore food int buff.
---
Hmm... we must be playing different games.
---
Gotta disagree. Played this event a couple of times, and didn't see any legendaries, got no plans or unique rewards, and got no rep for it either (even though you're literally helping the settlers).
---
Gave up after that. Didn't see the point to it.
---
Might have to try the soup. I play mostly solo on private so strange in numbers won’t work for me.
---
Well my old scorched mirelurk king just attacked my generator or collectron. If you move them out of their sight they'll just act Normal
---
I’ll have to look into stocking up on berry mentats.
---
That's the way to do it lol just listen out for the click 👍
---
Repairing was THE WORST today. My kid has gamepass for pc so i got him to play and i made him a shitload of gear, plus i got handmade plans the other day so i had made and scrapped a pile of those for mods. So i had like... nothing for material. I legitimately had to do repairs on my normal gear but i kept running out of ballistic fibre, screws, adhesive and aluminum. I spent like four hours grinding for junk.
---
I think I am going to move my camp back to a junk pile.
---
Could also run heard mentality mutation to get +2 to all specials when in a group. And stack with bobbles and magazines.
---
There isn't really a reason *not* to go onto a random bus then...
---
I mean you could also carry around a camera. I have one bound on the favorites wheel so I can quick snap a pic. She used the "Join Group" emote with the camera to bring me back over, if you're looking for ideas to get people to stand still for a second.

What event was it even part of?
---
I wish there was a perk to identify plants in the environment, too. Those damn Thistles are impossible to see in the Toxic Valley.
---
The radio plays weren't made by Kent though. Just the radio station. I'm sure it was a national thing and most stations probably had access to the recordings.
---
It’s always been that way for me. I tried filing a ticket on their website because it seems like people don’t use medics weapons enough to get these posts upvoted and seen by Bethesda
---
Nope.  I have confetti mess active, rad away diluted and very well rested active.
---
I don't think it's an issue on days you feel like, or have time to play.  On other days it's just wasted score for many people.
---
Shotguns can be funny things as a lot of them are glitched so will one-shot things. I can't remember what mag I use, possibly perforating, but I usually slap an aligned barrel and forceful stock on mine.
---
Go to the Fraternity Row &amp; take all the Chess pieces. Sell those too. But just a warning, they might randomly disappear from your inventory if you don't put them in your shop quickly. I had 15 pawns, 2 queens &amp; 2 kings &amp; 2 rooks.  When I fast travelled to my CAMP, the pawns were down to 1 &amp; the rooks vanished entirely. Somehow they expire. Not sure if glitch... 🤔

It's awesome that you want to offer items to players. Please remember, however, that there are a lot of reasons why your approach is not working. Trade works best when both players can speak to each other on microphone. When you're feeling generous put your mic on area, and offer the stuff to groups of people rather than individuals, unless they're a visitor at your C.A.M.P. looking to buy from your vendor.
---
I have to say even though the Free Radical wasn't hostile to you, I can't imagine that you didn't realize this poor player was getting shot at and you could've easily killed an NPC to save them from dying. Not cool. That probably frustrated them a little.
---
Not every low level player wants your stuff. Don't target people for gifts. Say hello first, ask if they need anything. Sometimes you're possibly harassing a high level player using an alt. Other times your attempt at gifting could be seen as a trap. Try to be more considerate rather than demanding people appreciate your generosity.
---
when we had it a few weeks ago. I only new the base recipes. I didn't know any extras. so I looked on Google and found out I need to do Biv's daily. I didn't even know he had a daily until then. So I did it every day and crafted every recipe he gave me and still ended up 2 short of completing the challenge.
---
Fought a gutsy with an assaultron laser on it...the worst.  Thought the never-miss-rapid-fire-armor-piercing shots were bad, oof!  Chewed up two secret service pieces of armors durability.
---
Checked. No squad maneuvers, still slow reload.
---
I have 5, I fund 1 on a building, I got 3 from multiple venders, and I won one. There are a lot of videos on the building that has a pie on top of it.
---
Apparently it was in the atom shop
---
On 20 now, I know I’m behind but don’t really mind. Working again now after lockdown so pretty difficult.. I’d be happy to get the raider tree, think it’s about level 50.. 👍🏼
---
Anything in the game is content.  The score track is the activity, the cosmetics are the rewards, the system altogether is the primary day to day content people can expect to see in this game going forward in the long months between events or story drops.
---
I wish you could block certain dailies.
---
Broiled Scorchbeast brain will offer a nice INT bump.
---
The pain of switching from heavy weapons to two handed during SBQ. And god forbid your weapon hot swap has to be changed too.
---
You absolute genius. I have been looking for ways to be a medic. And you are my saviour.
---
I agree but it seems like a quick thing to add. Radio plays are really easy to record and it'd give everyone something different to listen to for a while.
---
Fuck the economy?  How? This is helping rhe economy because now all the fuckers selling these guns for real life money are fucked. Caps had no value and you could barely get apparel for max caps. Now people can't extort newer players to the game that couldn't trade because they didn't have a damn legacy or perfect fixer. This game became a trading sim because they left in unattainable guns and made it impossible to get a decent gun. Been playing since release and still never got a god roll gun on something I use.
---
For whatever reason the scorched variants are hostile towards your camp but can’t dmg it
---
Yeah it gets pretty annoying
---
Do not bring your evil here...
---
Say that to her face and she'll string your entrails up like christmas tinsel.
---
first time i've seen someone mention this and that is rather clever tbh
---
Well I'll put in a ticket too.  With the right vats perks and weapon it's better than vampires, so it's a shame they don't work.
---
I think I'm 27. But don't worry we have a double xp and a double score event coming up and a lot of weeks still to go.
---
Photomode is even faster &gt;.&gt;
---
Junkie build PA Heavy Gunner here
---
Level 30
---
Unfortunately this didn't work for me. Oh well. I don't actually plan on buying this game.
---
I got mine from queen of the hunt. You have to know all the previous steps for it to drop.
---
I tried that. It attacked my Brahmin, my Robo and my food, I deleted it all but it still kept whiplashing my buildings. I'm almost certain this only happens with Scorched pets. It never did damage, was never hostile, it just behaved like it was. I had to be rid of it for everyone's sanity 🥺 Coz, that awful constant noise 🤨

 [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:\_Cooking\_stove](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_Cooking_stove)
---
ok thx
---
I wasn't going to actually have that much in Charisma. Inspirational/Lone Wanderer would be mutually exclusive, hard bargain is only situational. 
---
Hence my point about these builders needing a way to just note a perk is in a build but not add the actual points to the total, lol.
---
Hmmm. Doing a gunslinger build but using concentrated fire and night person from perception could be interesting
---
Thanks mate
---
&gt; Stupid clown suit wearing wendigo killing.
---
That wasn't even a daily, just a normal quest you get when you first visit Freddy Fears for some reason. Even still good riddance to have to dress like a clown for the dailies. Now I can dress like a clown at my own leisure.
---
Yes - go to Morgantown airport, shoot 10 low level scorched for their damaged weapons, repair them, then scrap for parts or sell.  Takes 10 minutes.  If you want more scrap at the end, do the mutants at the jail instead.
---
Except I want to use those atoms on cosmetics I actually want and not to rank up for cosmetics I don't want. You right it is designed for this very reason so you have to buy atoms for other cosmetics ..
---
Yeah my guy literally just screamed at the robot
---
I think the maths is 160 xp extra for every lvl... So about 8 k xp for every 50 lvls
---
So lvl 50 need 8k
---
Lvl 100 16k
---
Lvl200.  32k
---
Lvl5000. 800k.......xD Jesus christ have mercy
---
Im at 27, just after the t65 paint at 76.
---
A pet chicken would be awesome but that's not possible 😔
---
Welp, Rip then. I put way too much value on camp and skins instead of apparel.
---
With the exception of a melee weapon, any will do if you bash with it. Bashing wears things pretty quickly. This was the trick for the crossbow repair step for those scout badges for example.
---
Totally should.  Amazing film.
---
Level 2 ?
---
Exactly.  Same here.  I think everyone wants you (everyone) to think theirs are original to get ridiculous trades
---
I don't mind NW challenges but instead of nine creatures for one 250pt challenge,  how about three smaller challenges for 100 pts each?
---
Exactly
---
Like i don't think i'm gonna use any of the cosmetics or camp items (maybe the jangles backpack and blood eagle paint). The lunchboxes and atoms and stuff are nice though
---
That would actually be amazing.
---
Wood boards, craft them hot a few things fix them. Really cheap
---
 Check the station vendorbots. Server hop. Rinse and repeat

Bloodied Build's perfect combination of weapon's high dmg, unyielding set, nerd rage, adrenaline mutation make it so attractive in PvE, I just can't get used to the Rad Occupying my HP bar
---
78 should definitely be able to handle a sheepsquatch ... if you have blood mess make sure it is equipped. What's your highest damage weapon, I generally use a 50 CAL or super sledge. Could of been a glitch where you weren't doing any damage
---
Thank you, sir! Worked like a charm
---
Nice post 👍🏼
---
Through lockdown I grinded reputation on both factions, then it was the treasure hunter event, then Fasnacht. So when the ledgendary run started I just wanted to take my time and enjoy it.. there’s only a few cosmetic items I fancy, one being the raider tree.. think that’s about level 50..
---
Shoot em in the thruster.
---
Some other ways to handle this:
---
\- Log out of the server. That way you can keep your C.A.M.P. intact and can possibly drop them from a high height if you place your vendor on the top floor of your building. 
---
\- Report the player. You'll have to send a follow up email, but if enough people report them, they could get banned which would be great for everyone.
---
\- Place the vendor in a room with a door. To close shop, use Build Mode to replace the door frame with a solid wall. Problem solved, switch the wall back when the idiot leaves!
---
It's a standard MMO mechanic.  This is exactly why I don't like F76 as much as the SP Fallout games.  Story, NPC interactions, and world immersion is way more important to me than multiplayer and the usual MMO style mechanics that come with that.  Those mechanics are typically grindy things like "collect this unique skin" or "do this fetch quest."  While Wastelanders is a move in the right direction, the story and NPC interactions were pretty weak.  I am not interested in grinding S.C.O.R.E or chasing after gold bars.
---
I really hope they look at the synergy of the bloody builds and take that as an example. It would be nice to have more variety at the high end. Something like a high int pa/energy weapons thing, and a high endurance tank type. Unfortunately I'm pretty sure we all know what is more likely to happen.
---
There’s a search function. It’s quite helpful.

30, not doing NW or Bloodied build
---
Without dupers we would have the items that we find right? There wouldn't be so many of these fuckers selling stuff for real money, because they could not find so many of them. These fuckers are dupers too.
---
Godroll would mean a decent weapon if there wouldn't be dupers. Now it means perfect, because of these assholes.
---
Best advice I can give is to fight her from an open field and not be standing on top of anything (fence, tent, D9, etc). The SBQ will not land if she doesn't have room next to whomever she's aggro on. Greatest damage is achieved from when she lands and you can get up in her face.
---
That’s what I was thinking, I’m over 400 and it takes less than an hour to level up if I’m focused on that, but even if I’m not I still level up at least once just playing normally.  Especially since you can just lay in a bed for 30 seconds, eat some canned meat stew and have inspirational 3 always loaded with public teams.
---
My reaction is the opposite, I think the score challenges are super easy and very rarely get you too far off of your normal path. (Except the NW challenges but that’s a different topic)
---
It’s a bit of a pain. It took me over a year to get the Nuka-Dark recipe.
---
Thank you.
---
It is apparently. I've seen posts about pet chickens
---
30, only did one NW
---
You don't get 8 daily challenges, so your number is off excluding the gold challenge, it should be 6. So what didn't you complete ?
---
If I m not mistaken, the weekly challenge number has been increase to 7 not counting repeatable, so 7,500 weekly point now
---
It doesnt help that the game doesnt explain that people cant just out right kill you, it just says pvp is now available, bye
---
T Here's more to it than that though.  You still need to constantly feed yourself, repair your weapons and armor, and collect all the items necessary to do this, as well as craft a number of other items.  The crafting and item requirements make this more like a survival game or MMO than a standard Fallout game.  That's why I say it's an intentional mechanic designed to keep people around playing the game for a long time and to help monetization.
---
Christ I have over 2000 hours in and haven’t even rolled a bloodied fixer period. Not even a one star or garbage one ever.
---
Found the chad
---
I mean that's fine, you don't have to only play fallout 76. You can play anything you want, we'll still love you.
---
I feel the same.
---
 When i did the Red Dead Redemption  2 season pass it was something natural, fun. I did the whole thing and didn´t even noticed it was complete. This game season pass is the complete opposite because you know if you don´t grind xp or if you miss a day or two you won´t complete it. 
---
And lets be honest, everything in the season pass will eventually be available to buy in the Atom Shop, you know it will... so if you only want  a thing or two from the entire board you will be able to get it later. It is just not worth the time.
---
I feel that way about pretty much every fallout game (or any good game).  To experience it fresh and new.  It's why I always think game companies should focus on creating new content and new games, not grinds and remasters.
---
Don't get me wrong, I have really enjoyed Fallout 76, just not as much in the endgame.  I'm just not an MMORPG kinda person.  But I appreciate the adventure mode material they put in to it and how much fun it was.
---
Also, it's slightly harder to farm ingredients but brain bombs are an upgrade from fungus soup.
---
I don't doubt this is a "thing". Hell, it was all over youtube the instant it was discovered. However...
---
I've been doing my usual "hopping shopping" every day and have seen nothing out of the ordinary. Seen people say to check the train station vendors to see it, but I kinda already do that naturally when I get a lot of crap weighing me down. Nearest station run to sell and scrap. Seen nothing unusual at any of them, either.
---
I am on PC, though. Maybe it's more prevalent on console?
---
So one would think so - but I went through all Morgantown Airport and not only was ever single weapon I picked up at 100%, more than half even had extra durability.
---
I was like “Screw it - not worth the 250...” (since I’m not stressing about completing the whole run - I got the only reward I cared about pretty early on.)
---
that’s what i did, just looted shit weapons like pipe guns and shotguns from scorched and fixed them, then scrapped them
---
I just hate the level up challenges
---
I never give noobs stuff.  That's the most fun period of the game, where there's still stuff to chase and things to experiment with.
---
I keep a prime and a non-prime .50 cal on hand but I always find myself going back to my gatling plasma after I burn through all my .50 cal ammo. I do like it for one shot use, that or the bloodied plasma caster.
---
How is the demo build I'd like to run one but I haven't heard good things
---
Would love to have one for The Fixer.
---
Maybe anything that is night vision should show glowing corpses.
---
Level 2 what?  Im fairly new to the serum game.
---
get a cheap knife, or like the pole hook, its just a few wood and steel
---
Yeah I like my matt black but would be nice to have options
---
My starched genes is maxed if thats what ur asking
---
Well, now..I have finished Lucky Mucker, Dross Toss, chow line, vital equipment, importance of comm, photo opportunity, target rich environment, heart of the enemy, ecological blance, buried with honor..... which of these are not daily challenges. They are all listed under Daily in my pip boy. NOT under events.
---
Agree but they still annoying af tho
---
I enjoy a good netflix and grind myself, but I don't want to imagine that time investment.
---
May I ask what’s the reward I’m thinking off doing this
---
Oh...add Cop a Squatter
---
Starch genes, you need the 2 star to avoid losing mutations.
---
It's bad for scorchbeast queen but can do pretty well against everything else
---
Holy shit that actually worked. Well done.
---
They don't give universal skins because that's less skins they can sell you, get you to grind for later.
---
If you guys ever worked QA for a piece of software as massive as this then you’d know only huge server breaking issues get hot fixes, like a zillion presents suddenly being duped into existence, the next tier down get prioritized for this release or the next, the mediums get one or two in each release and the little shit like extra spaces after vampire never get cleaned up. And all of those bugs are meetinged to death with a massive spreadsheet tracking progress, while middle managers ignore QA and Dev who really do try and make these products better. 
---
Don’t hate on QA or Dev, hate management. Hate on the suits. They are the ones making the decisions on whether or not to fix something.
---
Thought it might have to have been equipped before they fell below 20%, much like you have to have the extra meat card in use before a kill, not before checking a carcass.
---
Weaknesses get exploited. It's not just human nature it's key to life. But anyway, the economy's not fucked, Stimpaks still cost the same and people are having fun which is something they've not seen for a while.
---
NW hacks are cheating, not owning items that exist in the game.
---
*But don’t worry if you pay us for repair kits, it’s an easy 250*
---
i think he respawned.    
---
never tested but from logic (haha, i know), born survivor shouldnt apply if he is dead already.  
---
 otherwise, why would be "auto stim" (quite the same as born survivor) and "life saving" (While incapacitated, gain a 50% chance to revive yourself with a Stimpak, once every minute) 2 different legendary effects, if they act the same?
---
44, don't even touch nw,  I got 50ish int and use  relish plus soup, super mutants give almost 500 exp, sentries at whitesprings give 1600. With double exp weekend I'm not even worried about finishing late, don't want to finish too early.
---
I think some of the problem is that people like that game, and just don't have anything to do because they have covered anything they care about already, so seasons was something to look forward to, but it didn't end up being very well executed, so it's seasons or probably nothing.
---
I’ve forgotten to swap perks back more than once, and lost more than one mutation as a result.
---
Solution 1: when you find serums cheap, buy 2, then you‘Ll always have a spare
---
Solution 2: buy the recipies for the mutations you have, make them.  keep a couple in your vendor, sell some to bot vendors
---
Soo... what?  In a month's time people will be duping the 60s after BGS rereleases a glitch in the next patch cycle.
---
If you plan to continue as a bloodied sniper then semi, otherwise full auto is better imo. As for mutations adrenaline reaction is a premier bloodied mutation. There shouldn't be a reason to drop any you already have tho they are solid options aswell. As for perks the "essentials" that come to mind are nerd rage(intelligence), dodgy(Agility) and Serendipity(Luck). And of course sneak and escape artist will be ur best friends lol. I highly recommend unyielding armor as the +15 to agility makes ur ap bar ridiculous. As for 3rd ability obviously sentinel is king but it really depends on ur play style. My bloodied build runs an Uny/WWR set as he is my mule.
---
Can you place other concrete foundations, like the zoo cart or the log cabin, on train tracks?
---
Hated it. Every gun I found was over repaired. Crafted a pipe pistol, without any perk cards to help, keeps crafting over repaired. Shoot it a bunch, barely wears. Ran out of aluminum repairing my actual gear to do this dumb challenge. Maybe I should craft a board and beat things with it. Do you have to actual hit enemies or can I just smash and object over and over to wear it down?
---
He's a bullet sponge. I have found the railway rifle very useful for large animals. 
---
You also will want some kind of shelter to hide in while reloading/healing. 
---
If you have a monster that's too hard to kill, luring enemies to him as a distraction also helps. 
---
First time I got him I literally holed up in the old purveyor station in the mire. Took about 30 minutes but I got him with the combination of the railway rifle, the gatling gun and the shotgun. 
---
My trusty .308 was just dealing papercuts.
---
Funnily enough, that's similar to how I beat my first scorch beast. Holed up in a train station.
---
I'd never kill my frogger.  NEVER.
---
I've not found a single challenge difficult to complete during my normal daily game play (except the NW ones take a bit of effort, that's why they're called "challenges", not tasks), and it's nice to login to the game knowing I have some things to get into every day while I hang out with my friends.
---
I ran across a sheepsquatch once at lvl 21. I almost killed it, at the expense of ~90% of my ammo, and it completely wiped me of healing items too.. But, the server shut down for maintenance and I couldn't find it again.. What I did was sit in a nearby train station that the sheepsquatch couldn't get in and went to town with every weapon I had access to.. Haven't run into another, and I hope that it stays that way for a little while.
---
Fashnacht bot helps a bit with that one.
---
Yeah but you're not forcing yourself to grind bonus score.
---
I did a calculator and since I hate nuclear winter and won't do those I need to trigger the repeatable 4 times every day along with the other challenges or I won't make it by the last day. Leveling up on my main is enough to trigger it that many times.
---
Explosive weapons arent the best to use on a stealth character.  You'll get spotted more than if you're using a different secondary effect like 33% hit chance or ffr.
---
You may have taken a radx in error - easy done when you have them in your inventory and are otherwise occupied! Radx suppresses mutations for 10 minutes, so is this a possibility?
---
While it is best not to carry them if you are mutated, there are often times when you find you have some - quest rewards, looted them etc. 
---
If you do take radx in error then take a radx diluted. This overrides the radx and will re enable the mutations as radx diluted is safe to take because it doesn't suppress mutations.
---
It's weird that we can't use the armor skins in NW...
---
Nerd rage and serendipity perk , adrenaline and scaly skin mutation, full set of unyielding armor if possible
---
Oh I’m an idiot thanks lol
---
That’s not the completion of season 1.....
---
Or when it says level up in a cave or mine and you’re in a mine and it doesn’t count...
---
gratz :)
---
It's difficult to like someone who tells you it's dire that you go retrieve their LAST working osmosis kit and then he remarks "Oh we have dozens of these but it's the principal of the matter" when you come back with it.
---
Oh if u r using Explosive one, fireproof perk will save ur life from urself
---
Yeah the .50 cal life keeps you on that lead and acid grind lol!
---
Probably felt like there was an overabundance of ghillie skins on it already what with the 4(?) armor sets.
---
Might come later.
---
that icon is oddly familiar, maybe fallout shelter?
---
Hope so.
---
That's not the end of the season 1 and you aren't the first. But, congratulations.
---
Probably
---
Wait does this mean allied for the raid or allied as in full neighborly status?

---
This is similar to what I run now with a few changes for NW and carry capacity.
---
that's just part 1 of 3 different levels, from there to complete season 1
---
Dont stop now!!!
---
I’d recommend you get a Sneak bobblehead, one of the US Covert Ops magazines that helps keep you hidden, and perhaps even a Stealth Boy.  As a sneak build, you really need to stay in “hidden” status so you get your sneak damage multipliers.
---
Welcome to Appalachia, where the devs are often obfuscatory and the challenges auto-complete!
---
You can make a new character and fast travel to an event.
---
Nothing that exciting just cause if it was I'd have to hang around all day. Plans, treasure maps, maybe a mr fuzzy token, radaway. Basically whatever I had that people might kind of want but wouldn't be tempted to empty out the machine.
---
Ur current mutation is good, no need to remove any, but remember to equip starched genes before u start to get Rad or u may get mutation u won’t need, btw with Public Team System now it is recommended to get a herd mentality mutation
---
oh dear
---
I can finally stash those stupid outfits!! Haha
---
Ah ok well I may come check it out just cause I like a challeneg
---
I usually stash the roof in such cases and place it again once everything is in place.
---
Nicely done!
---
I’m right there with you, didn’t think it could or should work. Tried it as a Hail Mary with no way of knowing their situation. I can only confirm that the two times it happened neither player was down for the full amount of time. Maybe they gave up early. Wouldn’t be hard to test though.
---
It’s sad that the one in Whitespring dun give any loot
---
Nice video! Would like to see the full when it comes :)  
---
Btw i also like to play as sniper in NW
---
No it wasn't cool but I couldn't find the guy till it was too last as was in a load of trees n VATs didn't highlight him because not hostile to me. If the guy had still been alive when I found the shooter then the shooter would have gone down.
---
And I don't play with a mic usually. I will however make sure its close by in future if I wanna try again.
---
Was more sharing because I thought it was a little funny and that people would appreciate it.
---
Added
---
could test it by equipping rad sponge when in a party (don't do it if people are bloodied though). If you see their rads going down then it works
---
The people duping the valuable stuff arent just putting them in their vendors for the most part.  Think about it this way. Would you rather flood the market and sell lots of god tier weapons for dirt cheap? Or keep a small stash of them and sell them periodically for full value?
---
Third of the way there. Keep it up!
---
If a person is referring to their build it is presumed that they are posting point distribution; which is 50. When helping a new or returning player it’s helpful to post it like that. Confusion set in when say I post my bloodied stats with 32,40,2,30,34,40,39. See my point? I could have maybe expanded on that, but I’m sure you understood.
---
I've gotten AAFFR and Bloodied on Gauss Minigun, countless FFR ones... but Bloodied FFR escapes me yet!
---
I'll be maxed rep with Foundation before I get one :[
---
Psycho is 15%. Psychotats is 25%. 
---
Honestly without adrenal reaction and nerd rage you're gonna burn a lot of ammo.
---
Wear a full set of troubleshooters and watch your problems fade
---
Kill critters, loot their weapons, then repair them.
---
Scrap or sell as needed.
---
they used to be an easy source of fusion cores and robot chunks. but they got farmed too much and Bethesda says "No"
---
Wow. Awesome.
---
How do I transfer game from hdd to ssd without having to reinstall?
---
I tried this and it didn't work, I have all my games on a different drive then my "Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76" is that an issue or is the game just not working still get same error after following your instructions.
---
Mostly around 31, guys grinding all day long can get higher to around 50 now
---
This is fantastic, thank you! :)
---
25
---
Yea it's really not that hard besides the lev up ones I'm done with daily's and weekly's in about an hr 
---
I'm already to lev 32(Gilli backback) and I haven't been doing an crazy grinding and least not more than the norm
---
Also I found that if you retry a couple of times that it will actually put you into a game with a blank screen and you’re just able to see the hud, what adds more confusion is that if you press tab you can view the game map and change all the in game controls and setting etc. When you go to the menu everything is fine except for the Bethesda.net which seems to constantly be trying to load.
---
Want to hear something weird? I've been doing this quest every day for a month or so. Pretty new player. But I didn't know this quest was how you get the Nuka Dark recipe, until I saw your post. Then I remembered I hadn't done the daily today, and it's nearly reset time. so I figured hey, I'll go do it quickly. And what recipe was my reward? Nuka Dark, baby!
---
Use the squirrel buff with scorched beast brains which give 3 INT regular.
---
NOICE!
---
They need to do some kind of event or questline with these cultists
---
N I thought the ez sources of fusion core is the fusion core processors, farmed once, then never worried to used up now
---
 **Perfectly preserved pie** is a [consumable](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Consumable) in [*Fallout 4*](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_4) and [*Fallout 76*](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76). 
---
just to further prove the point that BS is BS :)
---
Check the basement of Arktos Pharma (Project Paradise), there's always at least one in there.
---
Connect them to a switch, shut off power to your vendors so you dont appear on the map and throw some doors and locks on when your not trying to sell
---
&gt; queen of the hunt
---
This is the way...
---
I could care less about their little duping. We get the best armor / weapons just by completing a daily quest. I used to get butthurt a while back but not anymore since wastelanders. Everyone can unlock the best now for free
---
Seriously?  Congratulations!
---
I agree. I've dressed Beckett up as a Cultist but I'd love to get some actual content based around them.
---
My buddy got the tree last night and he is not a cheater. He knows his grinds and plays a lot. Everyone’s just jealous.
---
We did come across someone last Saturday with the final reward and we reported him lol
---
Lvl 150 want to play with other lvl 150s. Kinda annoying.
---
Did you go to your notes and read the plan?
---
fusion core processor are only at workshops, server hopping to keep killing the same sentry bots over and over again was a LOT faster and had a much lower chance of PVP
---
Sorry you would actually pay money for caps lol
---
So is the major of that coming from the repeatable XP challenge that gives 100?
---
I've started using that instead of perforating.
---
I think we are about to end week 2. How many weeks total will it be?
---
The reason scorched spawns in one location in Line In The Sand is because ppl doing the glitch so that part can be a bit unreliable
---
Welcome to the Wasteland.
---
Good job.
---
Bethesda commented on mine and confirmed it. Who knows when tho lol
---
Not sure if trolling?
---
yeah if you have high luck they will not be degraded enough to repair. i ended up buying a few trash weapons from some low level's vendor to get to 10
---
I'd like to be able to join the Cultists.
---
I spent months running around in Ritual Bindings and the Ritual Mask before Wastelanders. It's disappointing that you can't join them or do any questlines.
---
Then again, you need enemies besides Scorched and Blood Eagles, and what better than the religious zealots, I guess.
---
If you are on Xbox come find me. I'll give you another. Something I learned recently...if you take a rad x, immediately take a rad x diluted and the suppression of the mutation goes away.
---
It was datamined, chill the hell out
---
maybe try the rocksy glitch
---
I always use a bloody explosive 10mm as a quick way to lower my own HP with my bloody build. Very handy for when you level up and get a full health bar.
---
Those level while wearing x challenges where absolutely inane.
---
must admit; i'm kinda nervous with it going to gamepass. this game has one of the best/most generous communities, and i worry the gamepass crew may taint that a bit (not just them, but griefers coming back to kill low levels, which i experienced yesterday)
---
noticed the servers seems to be struggling yesterday too. on the flip side; i'm glad people are getting to realize the bad rep this game has isn't very fair though.
---
That was my issue. I was expecting new content, I don't consider battle passes content, they're an extra grind.
---
Problem is I expected it from Bethesda so that was my mistake. I was really annoyed as I've pretty much done everything there is to do in the game and this pass is just another monotonous grind with no real depth or content to back it
---
clueless more likely lol
---
Where awol arament is theres always one in the lower parking lot
---
Zelda_chest_opening.mp3
---
These are some aggressive pets holy
---
I'm with you. I was trying to grind away to get it all done but now I'm kind of meh about it. I like it when I get points for stuff I'm working on anyway but most of the challenges just kind of bore me. I really wish the update included some new events or even dailies to keep it interesting. Hopefully down the line they focus on some actual content.
---
do you notice any difference? im using perforating on my mutant explosive handmade, in commando. could be nice with 5 extra ammo with that
---
I agree. Wastelanders introduced two human factions and I'd love for them to add a third Cultist faction.
---
Yeah, I was like "It might take a year to get the recipe? I guess I'd better not skip a single day, then" and I got the damn thing!
---
Do you notice a difference between the two? It feels like stinging takes an extra bullet or two to kill enemies.
---
It just can't wait to kill him as a personal favor to Uncle Sam.

If you can get cryolater or cryo grenades you can keep her super slowed.

A while back one of the top posts on this sub was a guy asking “How do I get the Wendigo to wear the clown suit?”
---
I actually have a shotgun that wreaks havoc to all robots. All I have to do is aim for the limbs and it's usually one or two shots.
---
I'd say lvl int early for high exp and if u get any outfits that u wear over the armor from your questing and eventing. Do not sell them or drop them.
---
Hahaha i totally agree. Mine are all layed out on the front porch as you come towards my camp. So easy. If a player's vendor is too hard to find, i just leave. Lol
---
It's funny, after over a year with mostly bloodied builds I find myself comfortable letting the junkie get way too many rads too often, which of course is very bad without the safety nets a low HP build will run. I find it's just as easy to die with the full health build if I'm not paying attention.
---
Stop drinking its bad for your health
---
can confirm lvl 290+ sometimes i get unlucky and 2 gutsy shoot me at same time and i die. That god tier aa npc ammo is insane
---
Importance is in the eye of the beholder. Impotence, on the other hand...
---
I would prefer to be able to spawn as a creature. Perhaps something like a redemption round, where you can see your killer on the map. Gives you the possible chance for extra XP (bonus for revenge kills), provides a reason to keep in the game, and would make the creatures a bigger threat in the game. Spawning as a ghoul seems the easiest compared to normal (basically no armor, no weapons). Make it so these never appear on the map/HUD, so you never know where they are (unlike creatures now which is very obvious when one is close).
---
If your using bloody you won’t see a difference. I’d rather have the extra bullets.
---
Im on ps4. I really think it just glitched. I had starched genes on the whole time. I remeber jumping on top of a survival tent and everything on the last SBQ.  I just checked and all i have is radway diluted in my effects.   Ill have to look for the recipe in a vending machine. Can i get into WS bunker tp buy without doing the quest? How do you get in there?
---
Im level 63 but not that far in the main storyline. Just got into Abbeys bunker. Just got scorched disease proof from overseer
---
And need to find polly a body
---
Possible dumb question: what dungeon?
---
It would be even better if I didn't have to worry about choosing between leveling my level 350 character once a day or making a new character for that purpose which I will delete the next day. But you know, baby steps, we'll get there eventually
---
21 without trying hard at all.
---
Yeah...
---
Hopefully if more people know the full potential of the event that will happen less.
---
Love it! Good job
---
It's a grind. You can do the Rocksy/Retirement Plan. I believe convincing the Raider to come back to Crater awards the most points. I never did because I am trying to max Settler Rep, too, and they're much harder than Raiders because the opportunity is fewer.

I never got the Rocksy glitch to work, but I did take Charisma chems and sent the two Hunters back home, the Former Raider to foundation, and turned down the Rewards to get rep for both sides.
---
Do Photo Opportunity and turn the photos into Kiyomi at Crater, turning down your reward for Friendship. (Do this for Foundation and sell to Ward, turning down the reward to max Settler Rep.)
---
Ohio River Adventures-- sell the Meat to Blackeye, fiddle with the options talking to Fishbones to do the Protect the Water Pipe quest.
---
Give your Bobby pins to the Raiders scavenging for shit in random encounters. Also, if you find a random point where they're being attacked and you kill their attackers, you get Rep from that, too.
---
The mall is a daily for me  :D
---
Yeah, but this week, you've got the Weekly concerning NW and completing 3 of the Dailies for it.
---
Although I've heard *any* NW challenge counts for this, including increasing Overseer rank.  So that's something I'll probably lean on if, by Monday, we don't have more trivial ones to complete.
---
For most ppl grinding yah, its not that hard to get 10k @ endgame. I need to get more foods but with canned stew, carnivore, well rested and inspirational and an int of about 35, i get 417 exp from a mutant. West tek easily has 25 mutants and u can do it in 5 min. Get up ur int and youll fo great
---
Thank you :).
---
Surely, that would prevent people from buying weapons and reselling them?
---
I enjoy buying weapons I have no need for, sitting on them for a while to remove them from the economy, and then selling when supply falls.
---
Events spawn all the time.
---
You're going to spend a month grinding it out, most likely. I literally finished the Wastelanders quest just before the Legendary Run and I've been grinding and I just got to Neighborly. It sucks, man. But it gives me stuff to do while getting XP at least.
---
The op isn’t wrong though about lack of camps sellling items on servers. I’ve noticed it too recent. But as mentioned, a lot of people could be at max caps.
---
Watoga would be great. The cranberry bog area is basically setup already for a sort of trench warfare, and the city itself would be interesting based on the vertical height.
---
Ash Heap too. Never really went there until the mole miner event, but I feel like it already fits within the NW aesthetic. There's also no bushes, so that couldn't be a thing there.
---
It's what the beer steins are supposed to be.
---
Oh wait, no, the Legendary Run's stein was placed at Rank 100. 😋
---
I mean, we could join the Children of Atom in FO4, why not their Appalachian equivalent?
---
Thanks, it's been a common tactic since the first Fasnacht.  It also works on the Sheepsquatch escort mission.  Really should work on any escort mission in the game currently to my knowledge.
---
Glitch through doors using power armor exit.
---
This is the way.
---
In some ways, yes.  We went from "Repair a piece of gear" to "Repair 10 pieces of gear."
---
Guess Ill have to try, only use it against slaugther anyhow. The mirelurk queen and Sheepsqautches and such I use my bloody ss supersledge
---
From my own research and personal experience unless people start walking towards the scorched spawn you will always have them spawn together in that location. Unless they glitch from a bug where they spawn in the middle. But then again that's really good since you can tag them all.
---
if I don’t get the NW weekly I don’t care either. If at the end I don’t get to rank 100 because I skipped out on all the NW daily and weekly challenges, so be it. 
---
I’m not going to participate in a mode I don’t enjoy, doing events that rely to heavily on RNG, and wasting time I could be doing something I enjoy doing instead. 
---
honestly the only high ranking item I’d feel sad not getting is the CAMP items
---
I think duping is a problem if people try to monetize it but the only ones i have heard of so far are just trying to spread the joy to people of having their dream guns. That being said, i dont live under a rock and know thats not the majority. The game is kind of busted already and there is no economy to begin with. In my opinion, Id rather have a broken one where i can get fun things rather than a completely dead one. Like duping doesnt really feel like "cheating" per se but its definately an exploit that needs to be fixed
---
Events spawn at the same speed as ever but people have a reason to do them them now. More than before anyways. With the events bonus, challenges etc.. So you might not see them up that much anymore.
---
You’re bothered that your camp was granted a constantly lootable scrap resource?
---
Was that ever a thing, The only one I remember and still saw is wearing a clown outfit and kill a Wen-Di-Go.
---
Welcome to chazikstan!
---
Just hunt low lev scorched for pipe weapons cheaps repair mats for them
---
Cranberry Nuka Cola will also stack, but it’s only 2% so may not be worth hunting it down
---
Can’t stop laughing seeing this hahahahaha
---
Though I do miss my Responder Jumpsuit and Fasnacht mask get up...  LOL
---
Go to a work bench and try to build it
---
What is the daily reset bug?
---
I'm shooting for full gilli ss just got the backback
---
Back in the day i used a lvl 25 caractere to lure higher level players into attacking me on survival surfers to farm chems. It doesnt matter what lvl u re. U have to spec ur perkcards right and use the right equipment.
---
I used a rgular lvl 20 Handmade and a full Set of lvl 25 heavy combat armor. All of these items re easy to equire.
---
I can’t doo that because my characters are all 50+ and over cucumbered.
---
None of them are daily challenges.
---
Everything you listed there is a daily QUEST.
---
Open the map. Open the menu. Go to "challenges". Go to "Daily". THOSE are the daily challenges.
---
I feel for the players who just want to play NW.  It kind of reminds me of Doom SnapMap, where they unwisely had an Achievement for publishing a map.  Any map.  Didn't matter if it was junk or not.  So, what happened is every decent map got buried under submissions from people just trying to get that Achievement.
---
Congrats, now do the 2/3 left
---
Everyday when the dailies reset.  If you are logged in then you get most of the new ones completed and without rewarding S.C.O.R.E.
---
There have been reports its happening other ways but nobody really knows and Bethesda are silent on this.
---
That would require effort.
---
Oh for fuck sake.   OK...my dim light finally went on. 
---
I want one that shoots toilet plungers.
---
Please don't confuse indifference with friendliness.
---
This game has enough of caps, there is no need for additional ones. Especially with Beth's track record of implementing something w/o grave bugs.
---
As for your proposal... then it would be "duping on demand" and less obvious and more harder to fight.
---
i second this! it's the people who're really considerate of other players in the game that i really appreciate.
---
Hello. I have the tree as well. I did not cheat. I do play like it’s a full time job. I bet this poster also plays as much. Don’t accuse us of cheating just because we have no life. You can get a feel for my solid progression of S.C.O.R.E. Level ups by checking out my Instagram: @appalachian_terrence
---
I play a lot and efficiently. I one shot enemies rapidly like John Wick. I stack perks, mutations, lunchboxes, foods etc... to make my xp gains LARGE. No cheating. No god mode. Just way too many hours played, and played well.
---
Yes, I’ve accepted I won’t be completing the Legendary Run and I’m only doing daily challenges if they are quick and easy so they don’t detract from what I want to do. Initially, I was really trying to do every challenge and stay up to date as much as possible, but the challenges consumed the majority of play time I had available. That’s not fun tbh, especially when I have so much else I can do in game.
---
Thank you for such a nice comment :)
---
Wooden melee like baseball bats
---
Well I only have these perks for it:
---
Fire in the hole rank 1 (mainly for the throwing arc) you can skip this if you don't use thrown grenades.
---
Grenadier rank 2
---
Demolition man rank 5 for 60% explosion dmg
---
And now ordnance express for the shitload of nuka grenades and 40mm i take with me.
---
Also fireproof rank 3 so i don't kill myself too easy.
---
Here's my full build:
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=983b5b9&amp;d=pj0pq0c81ib4a72a42lt2cu2l71se2a04p02pp2eh2sg2cm2ce0c60lu1li1&amp;w=sw1&amp;m=cfeh36℘=w6&amp;wm=1b2039&amp;ad=09
---
Oh and i found a two shot auto grenade launcher! That makes this build twice as good!
---
Pretty cool ideal i have to say.
---
Thank you, hope it helped :)
---
Still felt unworthy.
---
i try and do this as much as possible unless my virtual life is in danger and then it's BOOWM!
---
Sometimes though i accidentally one shot a legendary and i'm just like 'sorry"' 
---
What i don't like though is when you signal for people to come get hits on a legendary and some bloodied clownshoe one shots it and it's just like.. really?
---
I think I got one in Fallout 4 after playing consistently for a year.
---
I got 2 in only a few months of playing FO76. 
---
My rule is 1 try every time I come upon one.
---
Any building you can load into is typically referred to as a “dungeon”. Might be a Gen X thing, I don’t know.
---
what is a level 10 going to do with T60 PA
---
Wells theres always a way but most people won't do that. Some like to play without glitching their way to eveything.
---
Look in your pit boy.
---
Sorry not 'season one' Chapter One... was just excited was under the impression this was far as I could go and now I could lay back.  Didnt use any sploits or anything either just purely did dailies and far too many levelings.
---
Thanks for the laugh from Seattle.
---
Pip boy, there’s a collection tab under the stats category. It’ll list your gold, caps, scrip, etc.
---
&gt; Pop back out to the play screen to see the fallen mate now back at full health
---
yeah they're respawing. you don't go to full health from being revived by a stim
---
in stats and then currency
---
Pipboy &gt; stats &gt; collections
---
Thanks for the advice everyone. It really helps
---
Care Bare *Stare* 💗💗💗💢🥄🍳
---
That's not even as bad as I was expecting, it looks pretty nice compared to some of the ruined buildings in the wasteland. I think those tents add more to the camp location.
---
You know you can just...not do them and do other stuff?
---
I got the stealth vats commando build....i love it!  I like high health too much to go bloodied.  I have a different 3* handmade and fixer i use for whatever i feel like doing.  Troubleshooters explosive fixer is my fav due to robots being the only enemy that gives me trouble.  Commando DPS is awesome
---
You are supposed to be able to see the amount your character has by looking in the collections category in your pip boy.
---
However it seems to be a bit bugged of late and only shows up as 0. This does change but only after visiting the relevant vendor.
---
Yeah, the Rock-It Launcher owned. Gibbing ghouls with random junk somehow never got old. :D
---
Ooooo, I've never found a solo spawned one. Also, it needs to safely travel to CAMP &amp; I think they're normally just level 1?
---
There isn't even a struggle. Daily challenges take less than an hour to do. If you're burnt out on the game, that's your problem.
---
Sure, but I'm not going to turn down 1,500 SCORE or whatever it is if all I have to do is take pictures or slap my CAMP down 3 times.
---
It's when it's stuff like "pick locks" or "use Stimpaks" that I'm like... eh, no.
---
Bloodied/unyielding builds have a huge advantage and not just from damage increase. As all your other stats apart from endurance are increased it means you have better agility for sneak and vats use, better intelligence for xp gains, luck for crit and loot quality. The downside isn't that big either as survival perks and not being seen in the firsg place more than make up for the low hp. This is why it's so popular. 
---
 That being said full health builds ate still perfectly viable. Some, like junkies, will do more damage but most have there uses. Even nocturnal.
---
 Commando or rifles is a matter of taste really.
---
Aw, a Radtoad is what I want. Where did you find yours?
---
I'm at level 32 now so by the end of this week I should be pretty well ahead of the curve!
---
Butchers bounty only works for the sb meat. Never got any of the special meat from BB.
---
Really helpful.  Thanks for taking the time to do this.   Nicely done!
---
To free travel to several places on the map. Camps, companions, etc.
---
Yes, yes they are. It was my first ever so I didn't know what I was letting myself in for 😔
---
Yeah I see 9 today. Love it!
---
Yeah lvl 1 so it'll be a miracle if it survives. A pet hunting tip from an expert, cranberry glade. The amount of deathclaws, sloths, anything I've found. It's a lot
---
It didn't happen to me Tuesday on my day off but thanks for reminding anyways. These glitches are inconsistent and easy to forget.
---
Make it 100 score for every 30 minutes survived.
---
Awesome news. I like doing these, they give me something different to do each day that I'd never really bother with otherwise. I'm 168 and ashamed to say I never even used VATS crits until it was part of the weekly challenge.
---
Was just about to post that after bugging out yesterday with several challenges autocompleted, I thought got bugged in the opposite direction with being given nine dailies instead - hope this is permanent!
---
Nice!
---
I feel like maybe I've never truly encountered the same types of these enemies that everyone else talks about, because I never seemed to have much trouble dealing with them. Maybe it's because I'm a tanky-ish melee build and I can typically charge in and take them out relatively quickly.
---
On the other hand, no one seems to have any problems taking care of Yao Guai, but those bears will straight kick the crap out of me. Whether its when they get spawned in SBQ fight, or Project Paradise, or even the lone Yao Guai that's constantly outside Dolly Sods when I'm trying to get the Stings and Things daily done.
---
If I don't strike first, they will pretty much stunlock me until I'm dead, even though I have a pneumatic mod on my chest, which is supposed to decrease the intensity of such things.
---
I guess it's a testament to the diversity of character builds and enemy types in the game, that one can struggle so hard on something that others normally don't, and vice versa.
---
Combat knife.
---
2500 SCORE available today from dailies. 
---
Very nice. 
---
Hopefully this is the standard moving forward.
---
Are you aware that rad-x suppresses mutations?
---
Was just about to post about this! An extra 500 SCORE is very much welcome in my opinion
---
This is actually a old idea of Beth. They once made a wipe like this and I am quite sure there will be another one. I am just suggesting it to be active all the time.
---
Gd hippes.
---
Hmmm very weird i must say i havent noticed any faster reloading neither.. i mostly focussed on movement speed
---
Thank you! :)
---
5/9 was autocompleted for me.... Ugh
---
Two of us in the same house did this today i stayed on he logged off, i had the challenges screen up while it changed over while logged on and watched them load in, none autocompleted. He waited and logged in a little later and half of them autocompleted. Submitting a ticket to add to the hundreds of others.
---
Explosive legendary prefix? Yes. Explosive weapons? No. it does not count for Missile Launcher, Fatman, and Grenade launchers
---
What time is the daily reset?  Thank you for the PSA.
---
yah man demolition expert works with explosive and gauss guns too
---
Welp. My game doesn't have the region issue anymore.. It just straight up crashes to desktop hahahaha
---
Hopefully all 9 aren’t auto completed again today
---
Sometimes I don’t even make it that far before that feeling kicks in.
---
If your on PC, the perk loadout mod suppresses those popups 🤘. If your not.. sorry.
---
I got a 3 star furious swing speed agility Bowie once. Kept it.
---
A week later I got an identical one from fasnacht. They look duped but I kept them because of the crazy low chance of actaully getting one
---
My biggest challenge issue is getting Sludge Lung. I contracted it a couple days ago for the umpteenth time &amp; the challenge will not complete. It's very annoying.
---
That’s a cool little thing to stumble upon as a new player for sure. And you’re right, so many great build ideas to be tried and so many talented builders to check out. Yeah seen aqua nova’s camps in videos and top 5 compilations. I’ve got the steel beams blueprinted too and plan to use them in upcoming builds, if I can ever leave my current permanent camp. But I’ve been using them in workshop ideas. I actually used them just last night trying out bloodied_mess’s circular foundations method, as an entrance into a completely circular building. For me, the main game was fun and all, but building is the real endgame
---
You running in Borderless Window mode? Try going exclusive fullscreen and see if that has any impact.
---
I'll take that offer if it is still valid
---
Did you remember to log out before reset?
---
But you don't have to use any repair kits, just use the workbench repair.
---
It's pretty easy to manage and nothing else comes close for damage output
---
I thought the ammo one would be 50 separate crafts.
---
Thank fuck it isn't!
---
All are pretty damn easy today, but the 3 legendaries one. So, that is nice!
---
Got 500 right off the bat with the ammo crafting and join a team.
---
Are you still offering this? Been spending forever looking for one of these
---
The best dps build in the game with the junky build, try the bloodied/stealth dps build and u can kill the SBQ in 1 min alone .
---
Bet I loose this by the time I try it tomorrow cheers
---
Wow, you are way off.  Try to be more considerate rather than demanding people see your skewed perspective.
---
I actually have my survival tent located right at that spawn point, it's where I found my Snally. RIP SnallyGally.
---
I did. It resets at 5pm for me. I got off at 4:50
---
I usually try to bash then with my gun so i dont need to swap weapons (screen frezze for 1 sec) and it almost does no damage so theres plenty of hp left for everyone else to get a hit in
---
I’ve been logged off and at work. This is not what causes this bug. For three days I have had most challenges completed while logged off, pc turned off, and I’m at work.
---
Why are all yours 250 mine whereb750
---
I called my snally Gerald, he was glowing
---
Thank you so much for this.
---
I'm so paranoid they'll nerf unyielding or bloodied the moment I put together a set of gear for it.
---
It’s because you kill most stuff in one shot. Health doesn’t matter if stuff is dead before it can react. Heavies in particular benefit from it because you’re mostly invincible below 20% health if you wear power armor and have appropriate perks.
---
It's worth the trade off in most respects. Still pretty tanky, and 2-3x the special stats, maybe more. Level up faster, kill faster. Less work, less resource costs, more reward.
---
The mic doesn’t help.  I’ve had as much luck with emotes as I’ve had talking.  U/porker is a dick.
---
Man I’m with you. I’m 337 on one toon now. I can complete almost all the daily challenges in one run of radiation rumble. Kill three legendary enemies (done), participate in an event (done), level up (done), scrap/repair weapon or armor (probably will happen from RR or uranium fever(done)). Eat food or build something. Like all of this takes 10 to 15 minutes tops and it’s easy and I’m probably gonna do it anyway. When they said it was gonna take an hour to two hours I think they were talking about the NW portion of the challenges. I did 4 play throughs of it yesterday just to get 6 stim packs to use. That took an hour and it felt like a chore. But the adventure mode challenges are pretty simple.
---
So it counts to my  BE gatling plasma?;)
---
5/9 completed for me too. Sad times
---
I'm fine with how much of a pain in the ass they are, I just wish they would drop something to make up for the 500 bullets I spent taking it down
---
This  google raider rep exploit.
---
Meat week should be in the break after season 1. If the schedule remains the same, season 3 should end December 8, so maybe some holiday stuff? I hope there is a Halloween event in there somewhere, I missed it last year.
---
Ha, totally agree, that was such a pain
---
get something with high INT for that extra INT which means more xp IF you're bothered about xp and all that jazz
---
I love the thought of a calculator, but where do I find the information I need to complete it? I have no idea how much xp I gain per day, when the double weekends will be, etc.
---
Hey there!  
---
I can give you one next week since my hard drive died out on me.  
---
Just shoot me a message on here anytime after the 14th.
---
yes, like i said above
---
That would be such a fun visual. Imagine the Queen with a bunch of plungers stuck yo her
---
Oh krass voll übersehen.
---
Adde dich später, okay ?
---
yeah somewhat just was under the impression the chapters were in terms of a month total instead of the seasons had to go back and re-read the news article again.  since a season is 3 months (and its actually only 2 months for the game)  I was going on common sense 3 chapters = 1 month each. and we only just barely into week 2 thats all.  Excuse me.....
---
Secret service it literally give accuracy, heath, and strengh, while havingvthe best defense stats
---
you can put a bug report int bethesda but you wont get the missing score.
---
Best to log out just before daily reset and then wait a little bit to go back in
---
I just complete my dailies and weekly
---
They do stack? I've only found 2 so far and didn't want to waste one testing it. Cola Nut works on them which makes the buff considerably better
---
3* Troubleshooters Explosive fixer in commando is my main for a reason lol
---
Thank you so much for saying this. I can’t believe the amount of whining here.
---
Seriously if I gave more than some threshold of picks, dont ask if I want to select one or open a pack. 
---
Please.
---
They're letting the dupe run to kill the rmt market
---
Its okay we all did that sometimes
---
Get over-encumbered by it
---
It changes a little bit of dialog and you get an exclusive outfit for either side. But the big difference is you get a lot of rep for the side you chose unless you take all the gold, in which case you lose rep for the side you chose. If you split the gold you get a little rep for both sides.
---
Oh nice! Now I’m gna 1shot everything with my flamrr
---
A decent grind is get an events team and go cap every workshop you can. At around 10 of them you should be able to just jump from workshop to workshop defending. Any XP food will help, we’ll rested.
---
Common problem. If you're logged in during the reset this can happen.
---
You're surprised people like GG EZ mode?
---
So in the hour before the reset, did you do any of those challenges would you say?  Crafting ammo is a pretty specific one.
---
Theory being that the challenges are active from 11 to 12 eastern, because Bethesda moved the reset window, but messed something up.  Sorta like how we got a new weekly at 11 eastern Tuesday.
---
Yup is a bug
---
Don’t login 30min before or after changeover that’s what I’m doing to be safe
---
Just happened to me 1750 Score lost
---
It’s not Bethesda’s fault you don’t want to play the game enough to make the content worthwhile. If they catered down to your extent, they would be giving us an allowance of atoms per month.
---
I forget the name of the event, but it spawns over the Tyler County fairgrounds. It has you hunt down 3 wolf packs to find an alpha wolf. The leader of each pack is a legendary, so just wait for the event to spawn and you can get 3 legendarys in about 2 mins
---
Just find the exploit some of these cheating cocksuckers on this sub used. One piece of shit hit 100 already. I ask the Universe to kill this piece of shit personally.
---
I've never died to Mr. Gutsys. I've died to assualtrons a lot though in my early days.
---
Rank 34, currently.
---
I think I'm ahead of the curve, by the numbers I've seen, and those were before the number of challenges increased.  But nevertheless, the increase to the required SCORE needed to rank up is already palpable.
---
This has happened to me to. Imagine that this was all just a big scheme for us to buy atoms to buy levels in the season pass lmao
---
When does Morgantown ever get nuked??
---
Holy hell lmao. I didn't realize it was so ridiculous.
---
this, change to fullscreen in game options
---
Are you referring to heavy gunner or demolition expert? The answer given above is in reference to demolition expert I believe
---
The game won't last eight years either
---
I love you.
---
The speed demon and perk cards don’t stack. So having both doesn’t help you. All you’re doing is wasting perk points that can be used else where on your build.
---
Get good
---
Extra 500 if you do them all! And if you don't have them auto finish
---
It will.
---
Pipe pistol
---
Why be that guy? People have the right to complain about a bug that’s detrimental to their legendary run for wanting to just play the game.
---
Sell it?
---
The nice thing is the NW challenge isn’t required for the gold star complete 5 dailies challenge, that would suck.
---
I like these better than the “craft aid items” or “craft alcohol” challenges we used to have, never bothered with those. Hopping all over the map looking for ingredients was never my thing.
---
I felt like that for a while, then I bought Bannerlord out of curiosity and remembered what having fun with a game feels like.
---
I dropped the whole Legendary Run.
---
I’ve been getting my legendary kills by doing Horde events. I never knew about them before this new SCORE system.
---
The name is Leader of The Pack btw, pretty common event.
---
Then just add a estimate and see if it is enough for you to get to lv100. If not, keep adding to see how much xp you need in order to do that. When you know the number, tag/track your weekly challenge that gives you 100 score for every 10k xp so you can see on screen how much you are making. As an example i play around 2-3h a day max. And i make maybe 30-40k xp in that time without actually going out and farming for xp. The calculator also counts the double weekends to the final score, using the daily xp amount you set. So if you set your daily xp amount to 10k the calculator will make it effectively 20k for the double xp weekend.
---
Explosive build is very fun, but you won’t make too many friends when bodies go flying around lol. People get upset when they can’t loot.
---
The radio (music and DJs) has always been a core storytelling mechanic throughout 3, NV, and 4. I appreciated the little effort put into making a new DJ with Wastelanders, but I agree that the radio needs some serious love going forward. I think one of the larger root causes with endgame players feeling bored after completing dailies is that the West Virginia wasteland doesn't always feel like a rich and vibrant place. Even when everything was "finished" in 3, NV, and 4, I just loved being there so much that I wandered around just to be in the world. A more robust radio would go a long way in creating that world where people just want to hang out.
---
Heavy gunner:)
---
Not based on the data trends.
---
Swallow some hits with a cheap wooden armor. Costs basically nothing to repair.
---
I use a knife with ss to tag them at uranium fever the miles ones and do the come here emote, but since the dupe people have those explosive shit all over the place don't even let us tag them.
---
I just noticed that too. There's 500 more available today than yesterday.
---
Had a team of three bloodied people in my public team recently, one left and another player that shared max rad sponge joined.....you could see how quickly it drained their rads and they both left too xD
---
That's actually sounds even better than my initial idea.  A bit of cloak &amp; dagger gameplay.  Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Stop by one of the gold machines and click on it as if to use it and your bullion amount will show up on the left part of the screen toward the bottom.
---
You can join a public team and it counts.
---
Military fatigues for life
---
thank the matrix for that
---
Ive tested all screen mode types
---
Indeed, Fullscreen gives the best performance (which is what im running at).
---
Boderless fullscreen lost about 5fps... where as normal windowed mode was just absurdly low fps.
---
Ill update my original post to show that im having this issue in FULLSCREEN mode.
---
It was never supposed to be completed its just letting you know how many hours you have played.
---
The game was climbing up in terms of Xbox One players before the game was added to Games Pass.
---
Just like ESO, it is getting more popular.
---
Hear hear !
---
12est every day. I will not log at all until 1230 to be completely sure I'm past it.
---
They don't want to be set up for PVP they just wanna be good with no work or preparation or planning, total morons
---
Harsh but fair
---
Nothing can get close to a bloodied stealth build if you're looking for max damage. Lots of good example builds on a well known video streaming app 👍
---
I had that happen the other day when I was the leader. I was looking at the legendary score board and someone asked me why I kicked a teammate. I definitely didn't kick him. I am not sure if he logged off while still in team and it auto kicked him or if he just left to join a different team and that is just the standard message.
---
Yeah, I had to learn how to do the critical hits myself.
---
yeah, just found that out, thank you though
---
it didn't work when i first tried, left my team, joined another... just another bug i guess
---
Yeah so heavy gunner has nothing to do with buffing a gun that has the explosive legendary effect.  What you are looking for is demolition expert, a science perk.
---
&gt; This is actually a old idea of Beth.
---
Could you link me up?
---
Its an achievement with a reward, thats exactly the purpose of an achievement.
---
Nah, it was never the problem.
---
were you online when the challenges rolled over?
---
when people need a lot of flux
---
Unyielding (aka bloodied) build is the best for xp farming, which is now way more popular due to SCORE system.
---
Oh, thanks for telling me. You saved my levels
---
Few and far between. But yes it's nice to see these people once in a blue moon. Most people are selfish douchebags who just mow shit down.
---
I was a bloodied build and would purposefully stand up and turn on pip boy light at events with legendaries so I would do minimal damage, even putting my gun away so I could punch. Yeah I always got fucked at those events. Nice guys truly finish last. Fuck this selfish society we live in. May covid wipe out 6 billion people from this planet.
---
This is not a good example. It was never meant to be something to aim at, it's more like a way to tell how many hours you played
---
Craft a basic level gun. Fire some rounds.. repair.. repeat
---
I have so many repair kits from the SBQ I just used those on all guns and armor that were less than 150%
---
Not the sharpest tool in the shed.
---
Yea I want it for my handmade and cr
---
What happens if we refuse?
---
Also what do you do if a real mothman attacks you?
---
Thanks 🙏🏻
---
The rifle ones are the badasses, it seems to have a distinct ability to punch through armor.  The laser ones tickle.
---
I don't mind, the more mobs out there that're dangerous the better.
---
Literally this. That challenge was a Pita because everything I picked up was over-repaired. At the end of my normal playthrough for the day, ended up just wasting a ton of ammo just shooting my gun into the air to damage it and repair it the last five times.
---
Nope, you want my 100 cap three stars you gotta see the vault. The cheap plans are on the surface though. Gotta spread the knowledge and secure the armaments
---
I threw that horrid clown suit away so fast.
---
I spent like 2.5k caps in crafting mats cuz I was too lazy to play inventory simulator lining everything up optimally. Funny thing is it really didn’t bug me since there’s basically no decent cap sink.
---
Me too...so sad lol
---
Same here and I had them all done in about 5 minutes other than the NW one lol.
---
Wonder if their solution to auto completing challenges was just to throw more challenges at us.  That way if 3 auto complete you can still get the normal amount of xp??   Lol.
---
Maybe they are trying to help out the people that can only play on weekends?
---
No i mean like i have my camp in morgantown im level 56 and never seen it get nuked or even close to getting nuked🤷‍♂️
---
I have mine bound to 0...never mind me, not enough coffee this morning
---
well you know what they say...
---
I have thought about doing a hybrid also, between bloodied and junkies. 
---
Do you have the handmade as auto or semi-auto? That will make a difference in the perk card that you will want to use. 
---
Commando for auto. Rifleman for semi-auto.
---
There was a brief spike with Wastelanders, so that data point isn't relevant. Once people tried it, and the new wore off, decline continued. Once this game is off Game Pass, the decline will continue
---
Did you create a new character or was this manageable without it ? Also what level were you on your main character when you started your journey?
---
Yea I feel like that challenge should come with an award of 7600 atoms. Anyone who plays the game that much deserves it. 20 atoms is a joke
---
I got two Mutants limb damage Handmades within an hour yesterday. Not a godroll but it confused me for a second when I thought the same item was in my vendor and my inventory simultaneously.
---
Doing the same thing.  I do do more dailies than before but I am still working on my goals before this started.
---
Oh I do! I wish we could place them in camps bot chess looks so cool! I don't know that I've ever had them disappear, I'll have to watch out for it tonight.
---
I went to the airport, killed all scorched, collected guns, repair the low level weapons. Got SCORE, sold weapons for caps in train station. Done.
---
They probably are the shed
---
Sounds boring.
---
Catch another disease first, then contract sludge lung and it will complete.
---
Needs this answer too. My game has some weird vsync to 40fps with rx 5700xt and r5 3600
---
Lookin fly. I like using the forest scout mask with my gillie
---
My main tactic against all enemies stronger than me is to climb (this is why SB, Flamers and freezers are my most hated)
---
Pop shots from high (and far) are my main strategy for gutsy
---
Lvl 208 and I honestly don’t even check the daily’s I’ll play for a couple of hours eventually check and then boom I’ve completed like three or four of the daily challenges by just doing what I normally do.
---
Because the devs do not play this game. They hastily throw shit together before dipping out to work on the Atomic Shop
---
yes
---
Its not supposed to
---
Because there are a finite number of things to do in game.
---
Sadly I am fully aware. I thankfully finished both of those reps a while back now. I lucked out and was getting Vital Equipment twice a day. Managed to finish Foundation just before they "patched" that bug.
---
Anything I pick up can't be repaired because of high luck, unfortunately for this challenge. Otherwise low luck and airport probably a good combo.
---
Do you mean loose sight of the post? Try adding this page to your bookmarks, depending on what browser you have it's different but in Windows Explorer it's the star on top right side of the program, on Opera (The one i use cus its 10 x better) it's the heart symbol on the top right corner.
---
Hope this helped :)
---
correct
---
Which ally?
---
Gramps is 100% bugged for me, others seem ok.
---
And it doesn’t seem to be a true daily.
---
No excuse, this should have been fixed within a few days, they take too damn long.
---
its old
---
All of them. I’ve tried all of them.
---
2k score starts at or around 40. Brace yourself. OH THATS RIGHT. THERE ARE STILL WEEKLY CHALLENGES THAT REWARD 1k SCORE.
---
Total junkie here.  I got three build with my one character.  Archer, commando/riffle, and shot gunner.  Currently playing the shot gunner.
---
I have this problem too with rx 5700xt and r5 3600
---
Here is a old reddit explanation of it:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aqn5tq/feb_14_duped_item_removal_explained/
---
Thank you kind fellow (edit to include and/or miss), this worked! If I had been paying attention I would have noticed the little dot next to “fusion core” that means it’s equipped, but alas. Thanks for saving the day!
---
I miss gramps daily. He’s my favorite and he stopped helping me out
---
Doubled stims and tripled npc kills. Maybe the next one will be “win 20 games.”
---
I think you might want to come visit my camp....

---
Would love to see it’s return, just hope beth turns down G A L A X Y  N E W S  R A D I O
---
My only complaint is repair costs don’t reflect the item condition. It’s still 14 bone shards with one swing taken with my gauntlet. Like????
---
aye. i have 2 turrets on top of those metal step things and it's just like 'no!'
---
Multiplying the challenges by 2x or 3x won’t keep people in the matches longer IMO.
---
Seriously if you have a one shot gun just pick up a 10mm fire it twice and everyone enjoys
---
With the recent dupe all gear is worthless anyways so nerfing won't really change anything
---
It has to do with the server your on it seems. Neither your on suring reset or when you log on after reset. *knock on wood* haven't had an issue playing during reset or on 1st log on when on a private server
---
Let me know next time you’re logged on and I can show you. LOL. Seriously though, it’s one of the best spots to farm cobalt flux in my opinion.
---
Oh the horrible mirelurk king,especially at a queen fight.  I cant tell you how many times those sons of a b...ch have ruined my day.
---
Though I would prefer they added a proper in-game timer in the pipboy, this is just a counter. 
---
They probably don't expect anybody to get there
---
You'd think this might work, however I didn't receive any S.C.O.R.E from 3 out of the 7 daily's I just completed.  We just can't win lol
---
I hope they do more caravan traveling missions. I’d be more than down to do a super long one where you escort it from one end of the savage divide to the other. Shoot I’d be down if Bethesda made occupations a thing in this game and made caravans one of them. Idk why but it’s fun to rp as a caravan guard
---
Oh I see. Didn't think of the high luck. I was wondering how the hell you get everything over-repaired... Learned something today.
---
Maybe the ‘lack of communication’ was simply ‘avoiding spoilers’.
---
Ok.
---
I've been getting frustrated with events. I love doing events with people. I just wish there wasn't so many trigger happy lvl 150+ cause I was doing uranium fever, and the legendary mole miner one of the last ones I ran to first so I could get my hit on it before they killed it and nobody came so I figured I get it down in health to mutate it. And this dude comes round the corner and uses a one hit rifle as a lvl 300 and then everyone rounds the corner hating on me. 
---
I just get annoyed they always kill enemies before I can even get a hit on them. I was doing my 3 legendary daily last night and there was 3 legendary  SB and I got 2 and then every leegendary I saw last night after those two were one spotted before I could get a hit. I was getting frustrated 3 hours to kill 1 legendary.
---
I don’t think it’s coming off of game pass anytime soon.
---
One wasteland is the only time they would. So we will see
---
Yes I know. I use diluted.
---
That’s the problem with melee and marsupial pairing in general. Jump 10ft in the air? Still ganked.
---
I should have stated, that I don't mind a good grind and to me a good grind is rewarding at the end of the grind.
---
Case in point, when I returned to playing Guild Wars 2 middle of last year, I had to grind to get a Skyscale flying mount that took required me to finish as much of the expansions as possible solo, pugging the rest of it when I could, gathering 250 pieces of 6 rare crafting materials, while doing lengthy quests, some of which you could only do once every 24 hours. It was a long grind, I really want to say from start to finish it took me a month. In the end however the reward's were worth the grind.
---
Leader of the Pack is a simple event that even level 5 players could solo, and has three legendary enemies.
---
And these are called CHALLENGES.  Don’t act shocked when one of them is actually slightly challenging.
---
Eh, some days, when I have a lot of time to play.  Other days, I have just enough time to do them, so it works out.  There's plenty of other stuff to do in the game, but if none of it floats your boat, it's perfectly ok to put it down to take a break with something else for a while.
---
Gotta turn pacify off and wait for them to stop for a second and unload an LMG mag into them. The rof will take them by surprise.
---
Either a bloodied stealth vats commando or a pa heavy gunn (either bloodied or junkies) imo the pa heavy gunner is easier to set up
---
If it wasn’t on pc
---
I work thirds and am only on very early EST and weekends, and in the last two weeks, I've seen Morgantown nuked four times. I'm on PC if it matters.
---
I sense a disturbance in the salt.
---
Saw someone keeping her in the circus cage thing and had a good chuckle.
---
I had it happen before when I logged off at 4.55
---
I now log off at 4.40, and dont log back on till 5.20 and that seems to be working (touch wood)
---
This has been a first for me since the season started. I'm just kinda sad tbh
---
I do always try to make my vendors visible, though part of that is so I can get to them quickly to put things up for sale. Pointing Vault Boy standees help when the fast travel node is wonky.
---
If you happen upon a little clifftop diner in the mountains above Manongah, drop by! I'm trying to make it as visitor-friendly as possible.
---
It's only recently moved and redone, I had a power pole in the Bog before. Beckett's whining and the scorchbeast neighbours got too annoying, and then the diner set(s) in the Atom Shop popped up. Perfect impetus to try a new build.
---
(EDIT: typo)
---
Didn't know about this one. Thanks!
---
Kill scorched and ghouls and loot their boards and repair those...
---
Oh wait, they can't be put on display?
---
Basically all what I also did, Hit 42 myself Yesterday. Great Job on the guide.
---
You could include Guided Meditation too, it gives good exp too, the faster you kill Things the faster enemys Spawn, its somehow even combarable to Line in the sand when there are multiple people attending.
---
Edit: Also Harper's Ferry Underground has Like 30 plus ghouls, If you memorize the Place thats some good exp right there
---
But that hacked lmg in the Bonus Clip, i wouldnt Show that in public
---
They can see where everyone is and likelihoods of them completing or purchasing, probably on a well presented graph.
---
Looking at that data, and feedback from different sources, they would be able to make on the fly changes like this to balance negative feedback with purchase likilihoods.
---
Heavy metal, sturdy metal, heavy raider and light raider are all event rewards and not sold at vendors. They were, however in the Christmas presents from that event so check with player vendors
---
Go to www.falloutbuilds.com to view builds and pick one that seems good to you. DPS-wise, Bloodied and Junkies builds are the top of the line.
---
Your observation is true that raiders and settlers alike share the depth, subtlety, and ambiguity of human motivations and actions. Their communities mirror one another in many ways. But this statement alone does not recognize that only the player is afforded the luxury and opportunity to discover (intimately) many of the internal states of these various actors. Additionally, personal understanding of these similarities and differences is limited to the player's own perception of this reality, which cannot constitute perfect knowledge of the actual lives of these non-player individuals. Based upon all reasonable information available to the average settler, a lethal and violent response to raider activities (which have a logical framework beyond the settler's immediate knowledge) is a utilitarian and defensive response in the face of hostile action in the eyes of that settler. Raiders would argue otherwise, but that is ultimately the point of this narrative.
---
Raiders and Setters do not reasonably fit a specific political class or entity, one way or the other. Being a "Settler" or a "Raider" is merely a framing device through which we can distinguish between the two societal groups that have cohered around the basis of shared interests, values, backgrounds, and kinship. Between these two groups, interests and values, etc, can be expected to intermingle and overlap. But just as often, they will diverge and this is presented to players as a stage for ambiguity and potential conflict.
---
It should additionally be noted that Ward's presence in Foundation is evidence enough that the settlers provide sanctuary to ex-raiders who have "escaped the life". It also means the settlers possess a level of empathy and compassion that is not reflective of raider society at-large (barring the exception of Meg's inclusiveness, which is often interpreted as weakness by many of Crater's inhabitants.)  So, calling Ward and the settlers as "raiders by any other name..." is a false equivalency. There's a whole host of atrocities that settlers won't engage in that the raiders simply have no qualms in committing. It's not even a question of magnitude.
---
So, traveling back to what was always my point: "I know where that man came from and he knew the risks when he stole from me and my family."
---
What the raider had to think about it is hardly relevant in that context.
---
Im plagued by this as well. What I do is click on my destination, but wait a full ten seconds for the lag to clear, then click to commit. Works 99% of the time.
---
Haha you felt like playing at all?
---
i see it a couple of times a week
---
Yeah. I like the faster reload speed because I  need it for my bloodied handmade. Only holding 30 rounds and all. I put the oldschool ar10 skin on 😋
---
The Native North American..
---
Bows, Thrown Weapons and Melee
---
I roll with an Archer/Melee build, I’m level 45 now and have a ton of fun. I also don’t run power armor, never have liked it. My spiked fire axe and anti armor bow are an easy repair. The inspiration was a strider/ranger build from lord of the rings haha. 
---
Strength - Barbarian/Slugger/Martial artist 
---
Perception- All the archery ones obviously, plus some green thumb/lock pick in reserve 
---
Endurance- Ironclad maxed out
---
Charisma- Lone wanderer 
---
Intel- Makeshift Warrior
---
Agility- Covert op, Evasive, marathoner 
---
No focus on luck 
---
I guess the focus is perception, strength, and agility in that order. 
---
Good luck! It’s a fun build that changes how you play, I’m no longer VATS spamming with a suppressed hunting rifle and the fixer.
---
Edit: [Strider Build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fd574a2&amp;d=s42sf2ss2sm2sn2p10pn2pt2pu2pv2ej4c72c52a70a42am2l90l60i43an2&amp;wp=waw2&amp;wm=11-1i&amp;n=Strider)
---
My first two trys were duds. I'll update when I get a good one, we'll see how many days go by.
---
From 9 pieces on the board stating 150 atoms... Where do you get your 2000 from? Not that it makes that much of a difference in the light of 4-5K atoms you were able to grind before patch 20 during the same time.
---
Lol, ok. Nerd.
---
This is one of the joys of camp building for me - I don't like using the voice chat myself, but I do like hearing others experiencing what I've built. Though I generally don't have people falling from an erratic spawn node anymore.
---
They're popular since there is no real penalty for dying.
---
I did.  I just realized it’s weapon specific.
---
Looking at a bunch if builds will.help you figure out one you like. By no means do you have to build super meta to play the game well.
---
You can only have 1 disease at a time then there's a cooldown period before you can contract something else. I normally play for several hours once I get online so I get diseases often. Woopsies is another I can't complete. For real, Woopsies, that sounds too cute to be a disease. LOL. And woopsy, I went off topic here, sorry 🤪
---
I may be wrong here but...I think it did the same to me the other day but as I completed the challenges anyway I still got the score I think. Has anyone tried to do a challenge even though it was grayed out as if completed?
---
I did but I did t have the specific weapon in my inventory at the time.  That was an hour of overthinking on my part.  Thank you.
---
After 50 (assuming you're not 50) you can pick a perk card or move a point around every level. You gain levels fast.
---
So for now i'd just try and specialize in one weapon type and then take it from there
---
It's a minute increase. Don't listen to these people about high INT.
---
Well i have no idea what go set up I have a friend who is a bloodied commando but he said thats hard to play
---
whenever i see a "kill X amount of legendaries" challeng, Leader of the Pack is the first thing i check for lol
---
Think this is the most likely answer. Need to balance healthy player base engagement with sales. Too overtuned and players will lose interest due to a feeling that the grind disrespects time invested, too easy and players will avoid spending dollars to advance. The desire to foster goodwill potentially skewing this to favour the consumer, though I understand Bethesda has had a storied history with its business decisions.
---
I went hybrid for a long time. Once you get your damage reduction/mitigation perks organized there is no reason to avoid going full bloodied. You're just wasting ammo going junkies or hybrid.
---
Full disclosure, i traveled to your camp and you had 5.56 rounds priced at 5 caps each.  I "accidentally" brought them there.
---
i dont understand what happened either, bit i will never say no to more challenges/score. 
---
im getting tired of my grind mini loop and challenges break it up a bit
---
Same bug.. PS4. retrieved the data she was after and now shes at my camp but she just keeps repeating herself, no dialogue option.
---
I had the same disappointment when I realised they used the Red Rocket stuff in the images. I had fortunately gone for that pack earlier already, but it made the Slocum's Joe bundle feel so empty. The vendor looks cool, but I keep it unpowered with a switch next to it - its sounds irritate me more than any Collectron, but it keeps quiet without power, and the vending seems to still work just fine.
---
yeah the timing doesnt make sense honestly if anything almost a gimmick to make you end up buying atoms...
---
It won't come off Games Pass, just like ESO.
---
Wait, there are other builds?
---
Just do the glitch before they patch it
---
You become cram. 
---
And he did come last night. A heretic killed him. He was turned into cram as well.
---
Doesn’t make sense honestly. If you’re using unyielding you may as well use bloody weapons.
---
I could be wrong, but each player would likely take differing amounts of damage based on their armor specs and perk points.
---
Thanks.
---
Good to know. These challenges are not as tedious like the atom ones thankfully.  Granted, I’d rather have atoms.  But it isn’t fun trying to find cave crickets at the uncanny caverns or remembering to equip 3 items while leveling up
---
30
---
I wouldn't say its hard to play but if you aren't careful you will die a bit. That's more of a stealth build.
---
...creates lots of serial killers”
---
-Criminal Minds
---
it all adds up though.
---
Huh?
---
I thought every weekend had 2 more? Wasn't it always like this?
---
The one time I noticed this was for the collect holotape challenge the other day.  It completed and awarded the score while in the loading screen.  It’s very likely that people aren’t seeing the score go up accordingly
---
Exploiting a game mechanic will always be bannable and will always be treated like someone’s cheating because technically yes they are, they are abusing something that gives them an advantage over you whether it be level wise or currency wise. Reading this I can just tell you probably dupe and are pissed off because you probably got banned.
---
Just make sure to set it as read only once you close the game
---
If you have been playing for a week or so. What weapons do you enjoy using the most so far? 
---
Unarmed, melee (one or 2 handed), pistols, rifles (semi or auto),  heavy weapons, shotguns or even explosives (not recomended)
---
And do you enjoy sneaking stealth gameplay. Do you like using vats or no vats?
---
And after the event another one starts immediately (kill one more wolf), so it makes 2 easy events in.a row for multiple event challenges
---
3 of mine were so I guess that’s 1000 score I don’t get
---
Or... if Bethesda are as incompetent as people on here make out, they've done this to stem the flow of complaints about SCORE to soften the blow of the complaints about them not doing anything about duping.
---
Happened to me twice now on ps4
---
Bingo. No need to rush into big fixes or features if it still prints them money. Money that's moved into developing other games.
---
It does not give health. Endurance bonuses on armor do not raise HP they only decrease Sprinting AP cost.
---
A reference is like a life-saving vaccine.  If no one gets it, it's kind of pointless
---
Heyy Im in that picc
---
That's what I do to trap camps.
---
I do hope they keep it at 9. I woek most of the week and don't get too much gametime. Im currently rank 10 so this will help me level up a bit faster.
---
I always do this now.  It became etiquette of sorts for me after the fasnacht event - I’ve been able to train myself to just tag and let someone else finish.
---
This is a common thing I notice in a lot of online games - Everquest, World of Warcraft, etc.
---
They create these wonderful stores, filled with lore and decoration.... and then you never go there because all the stuff you want and need is available out in the world by doing quests or picking up loot.
---
FO76 has so many areas with just missed potential.  I really hope that when we get instanced CAMPs they will have some in the Whitespring itself.  It would be nice if people were living there and instead of putting the crafting stuff In their houses went down to the stores and shopped, socialized, ate at the restaurant, etc. 0
---
Each point of endurance raise base health actually
---
Same here. I havent had a single problem since I started giving it time.
---
Trap camps are fun tho
---
Chimkin is better
---
This FOMO crap is ruining the industry. I have been thinking about going back to single player only games because of this.
---
Kinda figured they would do this every couple of weeks, and say it was their plan all along. This gets rid of the naysayers that said it could not be done. I also expected a score Value increase, but gift horse mouth - right?
---
I get home way after the day resets Nd some days some are already completed. I always assumed it was the daily reset bug from ages ago but it seems to happen even if I dont play for an entire day.
---
Yes exactly.
---
big bend tunnel east, talk to vinny standing outside on a platform
---
They fixed it? When did they do that.
---
I don’t know how much exactly but me as a lvl 78 has to take a stimpak every 10 seconds or so, I wear the Ultracite Power Armor without mods or anything.
---
OH this is what makes vats worth it. 1 shot a legendary by thumbing a space bar - who could ask for more?  I have a vats build for this reason.
---
Isnt it like 2% per INT ?
---
Im jot sure but when I equiped it I lost nerd rage and had to lose a little more
---
gut feeling says that they got weekly challenges jumbled in with dailies somehow, we had a daily of kill 1 legendary (3 in weekly) in the past
---
remember how the FaQ said it would only take 1-2 hours per tier,  ITV remembers
---
 **Q: How long will it take to rank up?**
---
* **A:**  Each rank-up should take between one and two hours of play time, with  earlier ranks taking closer to one hour, and later ranks nearing two.

Create new char for that overseer daily. You should level up in one game.
---
And completely desert us who doesn't have money to buy next gen console?
---
Well bethesda gives people opportunity to cheat every week on a gold plater. For free. If bethesda gives you something for free, you take it.
---
But I'm on ps4. I don't how you can cheat on there.
---
I’d sooner wait until the daily changes. To repair that number of guns/ armour uses far too many resources.
---
Make alts, for both.
---
Woopsies is contracted from diseased Mirelurk spawns, simply find some that hatch, best place is the Mire where the Queen is too. Kill all the Mirelurk’s, take Rad-X to suppress you’re mutations and then hatch them and let them attack you until you contract the disease. Hope this helps.
---
How long do you think it would take a NW Newby? I've only played NW for the simpler challenges so far, think I'm on overseer rank 2 maybe.

I can't get into enjoying it at all, although I think I could if it wasn't for all the waiting around for matches. 
---
Would it be worth higher ranked players making a new toon to get this bonus or would that take too long too?
---
Wish I knew what caused this because I was online, feel it reset earlier than usual? I have been consistently logging out, but today forgot and it did NOT auto complete any of my quests.  So I think the assumption of logging out is false, it has to be something else.
---
Hi. My name is Jack and I'm into all trades....
---
My build is mainly unarmed, got a rifle and tormentor perk to cripple scorchbeast wings to force them to land. I also have PA and heavy weapons for nuke zones (I also have Stealth suit now) my SS armor all has +1STR as its legendary effect and ive got 2 pieces which have 50% reduced fall damage so i can jump off buildings.
---
Same with the trap camp fucks who leave the server when you come back shooting lol
---
How much you engage with a game is 100% on you. Online games want people playing, so they're going to encourage logging in every day and reward people who play a lot. But what are you grinding for? So that a year from now, you can continue grinding in a Captain Cosmos costume? Nothing's stopping you from taking breaks or only logging in when new content comes out; trust me, you're not going to feel as bad as you think if you come back to this game in the fall when Steel Dawn comes out and don't have a fireplace door for your CAMP. 
---
If you don't want a game to feel like work, maybe stop putting 40 hours a week into it lol. Let the FOMO go.
---
Nice! I found myself a TSE handmade. Bloodied is not my thing tbh but i feel you with the reload speed
---
Its a 10 week event
---
np :)
---
Thank you for your post,  
---
As you can see by the time on the screenshot ...   
---
I was only 8 minutes into the new 'DAILY' challenges.  
---
I had only completed one even, called, 'event while in a group'  
---
... when I looked at the next challenges, 6 of them were 'completed'  ...  
---
And, I did not get the points for them :(  
---
Here is the screenshot:  [https://i.ibb.co/KjPDzfj/Untitled-1.png](https://i.ibb.co/KjPDzfj/Untitled-1.png)
---
The sad truth is grinds are what people asked for. 
---
They want games that will last them more than a few days and aside from replayability (games like COD and Battlefield have that down) grind and fomo is something that keeps people playing. People asked for grinds but are now realising they don't like them. 
---
I'm somewhere in the middle. I don't mind them necessarily but I don't like the fact that every game has them and its all fomo based so I have to pick and choose what I invest time into instead of just playing what I want
---
100 score per 10 kills, this would be an easy way to give kills meaning and that people who enjoy nw and are good would benefit more from it
---
that is a good idea, I will go try it :)   fingers crossed
---
Yeah i hate myself for it sometimes lol! I mostly shoot or throw one grenade in a group and finish them off with a melee weapon (My precious dual flamer chainsaw).
---
Cheers
---
Pretty sure the Endurance on items does not give you hp.
---
That one is most likely a visual glitch than a auto complete bug.
---
I agree. The one time I didnt do a private server was the weekly reset and I lost 3 weeklies and 4 dailies. I understand how sad you are
---
the glowing skeleton outfit was the last reward for the Halloween NW event, so since the unlock pools are messed up i am unsure.
---
No they can't.
---
The problems with this game don't lie with hardware limitations.
---
They originate from an engine that's over a decade old and programming that's so spotty it looks like Swiss Cheese.
---
They'd have to create an entirely new piece of software to "fix" this game. And at that point, they'd just make an entirely new game.
---
I said I was drunk.
---
Actually that's a good point. I'm rising 2 ish ranks a day at the moment, playing 4 hours or so. So how would that "later ranks nearing two" be correct when level 80 is possibly three times as much SCORE required. 
---
Although they li.... I mean made a mistake on other FAQ answers so that may be the same with this one.
---
I remember seeing someone say that the SCORE needed resets back to 1000 on the first square of a new leg. Is that true or false?
---
If false, hoo boy. Going to be wringing water from a stone by the 3rd leg of the board...
---
Any1 else have 9 daileys now
---
Plus endurance does it is why unyielding dosent give endurance
---
Weekly ones r the worse to lose IMO
---
Thanks.  We need to work out what that is.  Cause I remember the NW bug where I was playing NW when dailies reset it would disable the dailies.  This bug is almost identical, but what's causing it is a mystery
---
I wish I could be as optimistic about Bethesda as you are
---
I guess I'm just not in to grinding for experience overall. Though, with legendary perks being the way they are, I'll have to consider the best ways to get my level up there (currently sitting at 224, started the season at most of the way through 209). As much as I enjoy playing to collect as many plans and outfits as possible, I just can't bring myself to grind out XP, because I KNOW I'd personally get tired of it pretty quickly.
---
If you're getting 400k+ each day, though... What method/build are you using? I'm curious how you manage that much!
---
Oh yes, I know how to get it, I've had it, but that &amp; Sludge Lung won't complete in challenges. I think it's high time I put in a support ticket.
---
That's why I made my new character, Day Lee
---
This is how my mules fast travel. Lol
---
That line in the sand thing. If you or someone has the FO1st tent you can place it down and have all the enemies spawn on top of the radar thing. Just lob a grenade or explosivw weapon into the middle and you tagged them all.
---
You're a genius! I don't do a lot of bashing because I believe in causing things to explode. However, I will make an exception here! Thanks for the top tip!
---
In many ways, but swift is good if you are a heavy vats user, same ammo count less ap usage.
---
Shielded secret service or raider
---
There is a level 30 sentry bot north of the train yard above whitesprings. Spawns every time.
---
5 of mine were auto completed, i feel your pain
---
I believe it’s 750 per limb and 1250 for the torso. Helmet is 1650.  5900 total. 
---
[Here’s a good resource.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tSZ0FS2vzwguwv2XN2qhuyu_kw_0GpGmCFeI3GqRufw/htmlview)
---
This was my feeling too. The one to repair 10 pieces of equipment really stuck out to me. The whole point of the change was to have more natural challenges wasn’t it? Who repairs 10 things in one day?
---
lol I don't get how it's not just 7600 atoms as a way to say thank you, hell they would probably boost their numbers so much by how many people would leave their game on for a years worth of time
---
The Gambr-reation engine doesn't work like that, hun. This engine is two decades old. Bugs are part of it's legacy. They can add in new features and even rename it, but it's still the same old foundation.  
---
Part of me cringed when a dev joked about finding Morrowind code still there while making FO76.
---
I need to revive you! I think I saw you earlier? Level 522?
---
Psn: ssfastlane24
---
:)
---
It takes a lot of energy..  but.. if they weren't good at what they do (making money off of games).. they wouldn't be around.
---
The same one that OP described. And I'm a bloodied stealth heavy explosive sniper flamer build with 70+int.
---
I personally already got everything I wanted, now I'm just trying to finish the season and get some rest afterwards.
---
Before the season, I farmed atoms for something that I might want to buy. Now when there's no atoms beyond season rewards for me, there's no point to continue before the next.
---
They said it would take 1-2 hours to rank up between each SCORE tier, not to complete all of the dailies. You don't have to do the NW dailies if you don't want to; hell, today's a weird day to even complain about this since we got some extra daily challenges for adventure mode. 
---
If you really want to game it without spending a lot of time, do a round of Nuclear Winter on an alt character, just like making an alt to do the level-up daily in adventure. Personally I'm just gonna skip it and spend some time doing the repeatable XP challenge in adventure mode.
---
Havin it LAAAAARGE i see
---
Because the sale is on Armor and Weapons. Not Modules and not Vault Steel.
---
I only have 600 GB I gotta grind a lot for that thank you though
---
I agree. Just wanted to bitch about it I guess.
---
The FOMO thing is as much on the players as it is on the developers. If people didn’t respond to it, they wouldn’t do it.
---
Yeah...if only I could keep a deathclaw without them dying because the game just decides to break...
---
At the bottom of the savage divide, below relay tower EL B1 O2 theres a little area where events happen, and tamable guys can spawn.    
---
Great pet.  Sits in one spot, right next to my chillin chair, hardly ever moves, flicks his tongue sometimes, but is pretty quiet overall.
---
Gotcha. So it's faster simply by not being a spinner. Learned something new today! Just to double down and learn TWO things: how big IS the drive that came standard?
---
Yep, 5/9 auto completed, even the gold star one.
---
I sent a ticket and screenshot in for what its worth
---
Yeah they are different. The Ghillie Stuff from Legendary Run looks more like paper foliage made out of different colors while the NW one is actually higher quality (if you ignore the pants which are the vault suit pants without shining material, a bit darker with drawn on roots)
---
Iirc the Sans costume was another 14k
---
But modules are used to make armor and weapons...  the description of the sale on the roadmap says 25% off.  I'm sure it's written somewhere* that it only applies to weapons and armor, but my point is.. that's dumb...
---
By that fucked up logic, I should be sending my supermarket a check every month for their employees, or maybe a monthly check to my pharmacy , maybe a check for my vet wether I go or not, maybe I’ll keep sending payments on my paid off car, or maybe JUST MAYBE,you idiots can grow the fuck up already - you damn kids with your naive socialist views on the world are just alarming stupid.
---
If I can see them before they see me I’ll be ok.... probably.
---
I've only ever lost 1 pet out of many. Now having them actually reach my camp is another matter...
---
You can trade up to 6k caps for 300 gold to Smiley at the Wayward each week. Resets on Sat at 8pm EST, I believe. 
---
You can gat 200 daily from Treasury Notes as well. 
---
Happy hunting!
---
Happy cake day! Perhaps they were blamed FOR the launch! "It sucks! It must have been Mike's fault!"
---
Good luck crafting the specific SS gear you need for your build. You should have a complete SS set in about 1.89 years. If RNGesus is nice. 2025 if you have shitty luck like me. God the SS crafting always made me feel raped. Go through all the bullshit doing the same fucking dailies and farming shit legendaries to make 200-250 scrip only to craft 1 star mutants or 2 star troubleshooter for 3 months was too much.
---
Baaaaaaaaackstage is gonna be wild.
---
yeah I'm definitely ganna try again in the future the hand bothers me the most.
---
My one x is a 1 TB but I have a 500 GB ssd.
---
Psychobuff- +25 damage, +65 max health, +3 strength, +3 endurance for 3 minutes
---
High Voltage Hefe- increase energy weapon damage 15% but increase condition cost 15% if you have repair kits
---
unfortunately it did not work .... will report bug..  Thanks again :)
---
It’s basically just a cheap way to try and get you to spend scrip on junk rolls
---
I learned back in my badge hunting days, just bashing stuff once from full repair will do enough damage to be able to repair again.  Probably tedious, but just grab something and get to bashin.
---
I doubt the game lasts till xmas at this point, their numbers are hollow only thing they have is people logging in for 1 hour and getting off, they do an update go up 10% numbers and since it takes 2 months to get more content theyve lost 25% of their player base by then
---
Okayy I have been using a combat shotgun and a weapon called the fixer which is semi auto and i sneak around depending on the area and i do use vats yes
---
Yeah, YEAH, well, I got nothing.
---
Cheers.
---
If you're mutated strange in numbers is a good one to share. Also rejuvenated has a weird health regeneration effect so that's a good choice as well.
---
I’d like to nail down the reset. I thought it was Sunday at 8pm EST, but I have heard it’s 1 week from when you first buy it.
---
Click my loadout and count the points distributed.  It is 56.  I am not referring to boosted SPECIAL stats.  Perk. Points.  Unsure where you came up with 50 as the max perk allocation.
---
How high is your luck? I have 14 and still the weapons i pick up are only about half durability
---
I hope so, however, I just tried doing one of the challenges that was marked complete, I did the challenge, but got no pop-up notification ... I also did not get any points added to my score for it.   Thanks for posting :)
---
What they said was that early ranks would take an hour and later would be more like two. They said nothing about how long it would take to do the dailies/weeklies. 
---
Some days they take an hour or so, others, like today, I hit all but two of the Adventure Mode ones in one run at Project Paradise—yes, I was right on the edge of a level up. 3 more minutes to claim a workshop and make some ammo and they were done. 
---
For the most part, these challenges have been stupid quick and easy. The NW ones require some time, so it’s probably best to just grind some repeatable XP challenges if time is an issue or someone really hates NW. Still, aside from a few weird outliers, this hasn’t been bad at all.
---
Back in my day we only had 400 pounds of stash available to use. You should feel lucky.
---
I meant you were saying they shouldn’t charge us for items. They have to to pay employees, I meant you aren’t making much sense.
---
Can’t load part 3 photo. Please can you tell me where exactly is the monster location?
---
Well I have the pumpkin combat paint unlocked so I really hope I'm close
---
it used to be 400 
---
Just learn to manage your stash better.  *"Now I have to get rid of things like steel that I have too much of "* See. Too much of. 
---
Keep the minimum of junk. And then if you need something either buy it or find it. 
---

---
You’re absolutely right they know how to nickel and dime the fuck out of their players
---
You forget...u cant compare the two....they r different gaming platforms...fo4 was saved on ur console...fo76 is saved online on a server....and if u want unlimited junk stash, get fo 1st
---
Sweet, I am all over this one! Just gonna *ahem* 'hop' into a server. 😅
---
I used all my repair knits ):
---
Wait, you can *actually* get pies from them??
---
*Bravo six, goin dark*
---
I think the system is mixing up some weeklies/dailies. Still, 3 legendaries isn’t hard to do. Low levels can run Leader of the Pack and get guaranteed 3. Mid levels can run Uranium Fever for a guaranteed 3. High levels should be swimming in legendaries anyway, between Fissure Sites, WestTek and other popular farming slots—or just do Project Paradise, Encryptid or Radiation Rumble. Those events usually spawn at least 3 legendaries.
---
So?  They aren’t Weapons and Armor. 
---
A carrot is not a carrot cake.
---
That's not NEARLY as bad as I was led to believe! :)
---
Cheers I'm on the app but will just look for this notification now
---
Lol okay bro. I just spent $20 yesterday on atoms. Money talks and I love this game. Your salty opinion has no weight.
---
Part of the problem is that the game rewards it to such an incredible degree. Some of my thoughts about it in no particular order:
---
\-In any game where you have stat scores that modify everything else- usually the most beneficial thing to do is pump your stats. +15 to all stat scores (5 pieces of unyielding) is just insane, and negates any effects of having a dump stat.
---
\-Other major armor modifiers don't even come close- especially once you factor in the diminishing returns of armor efficacy (Looking at you Bolstering and Vanguard)
---
\-You can max out your sneakiness in a Bloodied build because there is no real overlap of legendary effects in the same slot.
---
\-It has no real downside other than being anxiety-inducing for some folks who don't like to be that low of health.
---
\-As others have said- it costs much fewer resources in a game that is like 50% resource management. I initially started playing a bloodied build because it only took me a couple of bullets to kill something rather than pumping everything I owned into a scorchbeast and then having to use a pipe pistol until I found/ made more ammo.
---
As someone who plays a bloodied sneak commando build- its seriously OP. But what do you expect from a game that rewards you for doing more and more damage? Those of us who like to min/max and "solve" the math portion of the game tend to love pushing it to the limit. I personally would love to see Unyielding removed from the game (if even just temporarily) to see what sort of diversity cropped up in the builds.
---
I wish you could score a critical hit outside of vats. I've never been a vats user and every fo games the critical outside vats mod which gave you a % chance to score a critical has always been a must have
---
Hope so even if it only happens on the weekends I’d be thrilled.
---
yup
---
I spent 125$ last month on fo1 your point?
---
I'll be here every night this week ;D
---
How salty would you if they restore the original 400 lbs that used to be...
---
Tour full of shit i just hit 126 from three back to back wins from 125
---
I’m gonna agree with the above. You have obviously never earned anything special in fallout. The options to buy with $ in any online game is there, it’s your personal responsibility to say no. Fallout is an amazing game, don’t try to cheapen the experience because you are impatient.
---
Wasn’t aware they fixed the endurance bug.
---
I dont do it for ez mode. I d it for a challenge bc with bloodied I have a chance to die. It give the enemies a chance to kill me unlike some other builds I've tried.
---
Yeah the rocksy glitch didnt work for me when i tried it yesterday, and today i got the comm daily, so ill have to try again later tonight. Thanks for the help.
---
5 caps is an absurd amount to price 5.56 at.  He’s saying he’ll drag enemies to camps that price things like that.
---
Typical Fallout stealth sniper build reporting in. Been using it since day 1 and never had any reason to or interest in trying any other builds.
---
That, and the ability to save and load pre setup loadouts make this the best mod hands down.
---
Yeah I think it was with patch 20 and they didn't even know from the looks of it
---
That's what happens when there's a Meta.  You can easily get the most damage with one of those builds. 
---
I prefer to stay away from bloodied and junkies and I still do pretty darn good.
---
Tried it yesterday, but when i backed out it finished the quest (i backed out immediately when i saw the rep bar pop up)
---
great idea!
---
I knew this was possible but had no idea how it happend, that's why i sometimes find those tents laying around there lol. 
---
Not everyone has fallout 1st so it's good there are 2 options :D
---
Use a shotgun, should get there with 3 shots
---
Are you activating your critical hit when the meter is full?
---
Are you using VATS to fill your critical meter with successful VATS hits?
---
Use a shotgun. When you properly activate your critical hit, each pellet will count as a separate critical hit (usually 8). That means you only need 4 shotgun critical hits.
---
So you're admitting it is ez mode then
---
No more questions, your honour.
---
Unlike FO3, Crits in FO4 and FO76 are manually enabled while in VATS. While in VATS you will see a bar in the middle of your screen fill as you hit enemies while in VATS. When it's full, press your Jump button/key to toggle your next shot to be a critical.
---
You bet! Stop by my camp!
---
Go to the mentioned above link and find a sneak fixer VATS build. Use it as a template and make adjustments as you see fit
---
Use manual crits. Every successful hit in VATS raises the crit bar, and when filled you hit (whatever the button is for your system) to make your next hit a crit. Just like in FO4.
---
Usually takes 4, since it’s 8 pellets each. 
---
But I don’t think OP is using their critical hits at all.
---
U forgot to mention to kill the sentry bots @WS. Easy 1000XP each.
---
i believe nothing carries over
---
As a heavy. I didn’t realize manual crits were a thing until my wife talked about it cause of the dailies
---
Awesome! On my way!
---
Nobody knows yet hopefully not
---
Fallout 1st... you know you want to.
---
A family favourite. The smart choice.
---
Seriously. You can buy Fallout 1st for 1 month, spend that month filling your Scrap Box, treat it as a quest. Then afterwards you can draw from the Scrap Box and keep your Stash and inventory squeaky clean.
---
You can always buy another month in the future and do the same again.
---
You get the tent also for that month which can be seen as a bonus.
---
Just use VATS and hit the critical button when the meter fills.  Automatic weapons fill the meter quickly.  There are perk cards but not required.
---
Part 3 was a picture of West Tec on the map but site is crashing i don't know why. If you want the monsters location it's on part 2.
---
Yes. We already know what will be in the 2025 winter season.
---
I don’t price ammo at 5 caps per tho. I don’t sell ammo in vending machines at all
---
Are you people signed into the game between 12:00 and 12:30?  I've avoided being in game during that time, no problem what so far with it.
---
Okay mister scientist man
---
Oh then I misunderstood him. But yeah 4, which is much faster than any rifle.
---
He’s not talking about you dude.  He’s speaking generally.
---
Expect the worst
---
The Breach and Clear event (always in the Ash Heap, southwest corner) also gives you a ton of lead ore.
---
Hmm, I never looked for this bar. 400 hours in and I'm still learning...
---
My bloodied melee character outperforms everything, including my pretty much carbon copy bloodied rifle build. More everything, less cost. It’s insane
---
No it will not. FF on steam and Bethesda launcher don’t even roll over.
---
On the plus side, they should be adding in the BoS content later this summer so that should give us something else to do while we're completing those challenges...
---
It's probably great for the new GamePass folks or people just jumping in to play Wastelanders... But just more grind for the rest of us
---
   
---
Yes, but I have also seen the number of times they die. Three or four times per session many. I don't even remember the last time they killed me with my PA
---
Thank you mate!
---
Good luck. I have always bought on Sunday afternoon and not missed one yet.
---
ign? (msg me)
---
My guy the challenges aren’t that difficult 😂
---
The best Events to farm XP are Path of Enlightment and Radiation Rumble.
---
OK, I posted the bug ... I hope something will come of it :)  
---

---
ZAX got blueprints probably
---
There are no random crits in FO76, they must be activated in VATS
---
By sentry bots do you mean the the assaultrons and mr handy robots? I'm pretty sure i've put it in the guide to skip those since they aren't worth too much XP to be bothered but yes "some" do give XP i personally just don't kill them since they don't offer efficent XP&gt;time
---
That's just me though everyone is welcome to kill those too.
---
Absolutely. Add in the right Luck perks and you can l pick this none out in less than two minutes.
---
If you're on xbox, if you ever have this challenge again, ill happily drop you 10 crappy weapons lol
---
I'm in the UK, maybe it is a localization error. At least searching for Smiley on the support blog should bring up the article.
---
[Search for Smiley, should be first result.](https://help.bethesda.net/)
---
So i looked at posts and stuff. Roughly 20k score a week doing every challenge. 220k is needed to hit rank 100. They just dont expect anyone to hit 100 do they
---
I buy it on Sunday afternoon eastern time. Not had a problem yet
---
Yup it's the easiest challenge imo 😉
---
Agreed, one is worth about 1k
---
That's one solution! Thanks. :)
---
Edit: AGGH!! You can't display burnt comics or magazines. &gt;: (
---
Did this still count? I almost used mine but thought there's a chance it wouldn't count
---
I’d go with ‘craft 50 ammo’ for that one. Or ‘collect 50 water’.
---
Unless we bitch most likely that was the extent of their seasons idea so far I would say. Its certainly comes off in vision and statisically as a money scheme and another grind to create an illusion of end game content. So I believe they are probly planning to add score to the limited time event rewards to push us to participate in them as well based off the last 2 major grinds they forced on us.(Bullion/notes)
---
Put the game down and uninstall it. It's unlikely this game will change. And if it does you can come back later all the same.
---
Plenty of other games to enjoy, but you have to break free from your self inflicted curse first.
---
What exactly are seasons in other games?  I’m typically a single player guy so I’m not sure how this compares to others.
---
On the top of the roof you can get a pie
---
I think you'll be able to.  And BoS too, not that I give a fuck abkut them.  I think BGS created more faction content than was released with Wastelanders so that they can string factions/rep grind along for a year or two.  I'm not saying that content is 100% ready, but I do think they have the framework up for a few more factions (Cult, Bros., Enclave, Molepeople).
---
Ok I see what’s going on. There’s some misunderstanding. You start with 6 points at lvl 1. One point In each SPECIAL. You can’t remove those 6. As you level you are give a point for each level up to 49. In any builder you can allocate 49 points. 49 is the distribution. You are a little confused but I have patience.
---
My pleasure! Thank you too!
---
It’s not a bug. It’s always gone off of the base amount of amount. Neither Ammosmith or Super Duper have an I over for that.
---
Also, I spent much of my original playtime in the cultist bindings and atom store hood.  So props :)
---
No i dont. I mean the big ones. They give +1k XP each.
---
If you're asking what i think you're asking, pipe weapons are for you... i mean your friend
---
If on xbox, but 1 month 1st sub, spend or save atoms, cancel sub for full refund, rinse and repeat until target atoms reached. Bethesda fucks you all day long. Fuck them back.
---
It’s actually only 49
---
They might keep it the same. Bethesda did say they were getting feedback from this season and they might change some things around for next season.
---
Just get yourself a set of hacked unyielding power armor.
---
I am  disgusted to report that instead of agreeing and shaking my fist, I shook my head and chuckled. Bethesda, why do you mess with my head so??
---
Reset, I believe occurs at 12:00 Noon EST? In my country, it resets at 12 midnight, GMT+8.
---
it would be nice if they put an 10hrs main quest plus 5hrs side quests and 1 dailies and 4 events each season.
---
Assuming west coast, It was at 9 am?
---
Eh, my luck is as 12 and I found enough junk weapons from scorched to get the daily without too much hassle
---
It does not roll over.
---
Today has been the only time i was logged in at that time so thats def the case.
---
I... hadn't thought about this. The more skins they add, the less likely we are to be able to identify every single one every single time. Hmm.
---
It's because they want you to pay for fallout 1st
---
This is double score weekend?
---
Congrats(honestly)

Just another set of items I feel cheated for grinding and wasting my time.(rarity/limited time rewards these are not)
---
Use this website to help. It will give you a roadmap of where to put everything. But honestly you won’t find your build till later in the game. I was two handed melee forever till I wasn’t.

Crafting ammo is definitely easy. But collecting 50 water takes some time, well unless you can produce 50 purified water by yourself or want to collect dirty water 50 times.
---
The problem is the non-stackable...weapons, armour etc. It all takes up data that's has to be transfered across the network every time you or another player interacts with your stash. More stash = more data = slower network = lag. 
---
The FO1st unlimited junk is purely stackable and can be expressed simply as a name and number, and it doesn't get shared other than between you and the server.
---
The FO4 stash is local only with no data transfers and is limited only by your system. It's a very different method.
---
it think it is 5,900 - 6,500 gold bullion
---
I thought so 2 but 2 days in a row I forgot to log off and didn't get the bug
---
Yes it counts
---
100% sure that this happens for normal enemies as well. It just happened to a Super Mutant Primus. He regenerated to full HP twice and he was NOT a legendary, also his corpse wasn't legendary.
---
Next time I'll record it because this is super annoying.
---
Additional tips: 
---
\- Inspirational lvl 3 = 15% more xp
---
\- Herd mentality = +2 INT, +3 INT with Strange in numbers
---
\- Cranberry relish will give you +10% xp, +20% with herbivore but you won't get extra INT from scorchbeast brain. I don't know which is better, 10% +8 INT or 20% +4 INT. I roll with cranberry relish because it's easy to cook.
---
You’ll make more use of bloody weapons with unyielding for most of the game but collect vanguard and bolstering armor and junky weapons for the upcoming Colossal Problem event or if you have a good team. Maybe Bethesda will bring back CQC vault raids.
---
Nice, thanks for quick reply
---
You can place it on some train tracks! Itll glitch through a bit.
---
New players tend to do that. They don’t have the fix-it perks to avoid repairs or enough resources to buy new gear or craft new gear. And their lower level gear has less durability.
---
Honestly, if I ever go back to PC I'm going to treat it as fallout 76 with the cheat menu turned on. You can bet your ass I'll be rocking that Unyielding Sentinels PA all the way.
---
I've noticed this, as well. I always seem to spawn in behind my camp. I hope other people don't. I've noticed it's not terribly pretty, being it's where I dumped all the stuff I didn't think people wanted to look at...
---
it should be in settings
---
I’m not there yet, but I was one sayin grant would be a nice feature. 
---
However, with the extra dailies (if that sticks around) the grind will be a little easier.
---
After i read this i guess dupes, godmode are ok. Sorry folks but to me ppl claiming that game is exellent when shite like this is going on are just delusional. Some Steam early access games in greater state than this almost 2 years since release wannabe AAA project. 
---
Here is a tip: ppl who constantly pointing at flaws love the game and want it to be better. They seeing game potential and seeing how they being screwed over and over. Sorry for a little rant.
---
Full unyielding for 30% bonus exp, with 1I on each peice, that’s another 10%, then base int of 15 is another 30, then chems for another 10%, and the right food buffs for another 30%... 
---
Or even 8% more from public teams, get a double exp weekend, with a 100% bonus from lunchboxes, and you’ve got insane exp.
---
I think it has to do with the checking system when sgarting up more so than just being logged in. Going to atomic shop, legendary run, or NW can all have similar effects. I noticed when i was logged in it didnt do it, but I checked the dailies later on and hadnt opened the map or anything during. Not willing to test it out, but seems more plausible.
---
Ya. I’m trying to go with a merchant kind of build and I found a video on it just to see what perks will be good. But this website will help a lot.
---
There’s been a lot of controversy about shadowed. It has been broken on anything but leather up until the last patch where Bethesda claims to have fixed it. I haven’t read anything yet so it may still be broken.
---
Just wait until you realize you can spam critical hits by holding down that button instead of tapping it every time
---
It’s totally op. If you go the market, the prices of items with a bloodied, unyielding or bolstering prefix are drastically higher than any other
---
This. Smart Person!
---
As a heavy get a decent shotgun. Each pellet counts as its own hit so 3-4 crits should cover the 25 hits
---
But I think it’s important to point out that the low levels, who might be struggling to find mats where the high levels farm them; aren’t going to have the option so readily available. 
---
I know I’m guilty of taking every fan I see for gears and what’s a low level to do? Go kill a bunch of mole miners? 
---
My point about freemium is still the same. Love the game and the new updates but still can’t help but laugh about how sly they are about freemium gameplay
---
I haven’t heard of the duplication thing until now
---
I'll dupe you a set rn baby
---
Im wondering if that guy was party hopping to mess with the bloodied builds?
---
Lol I wish repair kits were transferrable. I have more improved repair kits than I know what to do with. Would've happily donated.
---
Yeah thats a thing i think i do pretty good with furious. Mayby soloing a Queen would be a chore and waste of a lot of ammo but part from that nothing is really challanging (ok mayby 5 assaultrons).
---
Part of it to is that it makes doing the level up challenege more easy because you can fly through all of weat tek and the burrows in 5ish mins. It also saves you a ton of time and effort on ammo, I have a "regular" alt and I am constantly making ammo, with bloodied depending on where im going the ammo you pick up can keep you going for a week. 
---
But tbf, it used to actually take quite a bit of effort to really put the build together before all of the duping.
---
Use an alt? My main is level 340 and I wouldn't dream of leveling him up daily. I just go over to a different toon for a bit and nock it out in like 20 minutes
---
Make a second character for that challenge. Just make sure to switch to your main before claiming rewards.
---
Nice name drop. lol
---
Probably thinking about the original xbox one because old one was a 500gb
---
I had no idea that the rewards counted for multiple characters
---
3 games after and it unlocks 😊
---
Or that you could even do that, thanks
---
I built an alt specifically for SCORE grinding. Probably won't be too useful until next season, but still a good idea.
---
Nice guide
---
Thrusters and chest for everything except robobrains and security bots.
---
Psh. Mr Fuzzy gives HUGS to his beloved followers! Mothman just holds mad dance parties. Which are nice! But they're no replacement for a warm Fuzzy hug.
---
No combat armor ghillie though:/
---
So... the actual cultist outfit was too mainstream?
---
Well what a surprise, all that math and fearmongering from last week is completely worthless now. It's almost like extrapolating the results of the first few days of a 10 week event isn't a very bright idea
---
Find a river or pond. Spam the collect button. I need Boiled Water regularly anyways. 
---
My camp is on a pond so when that one popped up before, it took about 30 seconds to complete.
---
No more responder outfit drops? Bummer
---
Agreed sometimes there's up to five at WS. Great XP
---
I don't think I would be able to beat the Queen in the time allowed and it would waste far too much ammo for me solo. The Queen was never meant to be soloed,  It is an online game after all.
---
 I use an instigating full health rifleman build and can one shot everything in the game except for bosses. 
---
My highest damage head shot was over 5000. My current weapon can head shot for 4000 and gut shot for 1200 on non bosses. I am perfectly fine with those numbers.
---
 Bloody does sound fun with the amount of damage you can produce but I prefer full health.
---
Yup. You can do any of them on separate toons and they will all progress you. Note it is the same challenges for the whole account, you can't do them multiple times
---
Secret service torso 1250
---
Secret service arms 1500
---
Secret service legs 1500
---
Don't get the helmet, it is purely cosmetic and has no damage resistance at all.
---
Yes, but we now have stupid nw quests, and as I am probably the worst PvP player ever it takes me ages.
---
How do you post an image
---
Because Bethesda
---
They should make a mod for the brodsider that lets it shoot junk ammo like an overpowered shotgun.
---
I'm not a fan of NW either, but some of those challenges can be done in 1 match. I did the stimpak challenge in 2 matches last night. The camp deploy from the other day was a breeze, just put the module down 3 times and you're done.
---
Why would you pick those to drop?
---
Game* I’m too pissed rn
---
I have a glitch with 3 of my daily quests that have to do with reputation, 2 for the Raiders and Vital Equipment. Yesterday Vital Equipment reset 5 times in one day and the all Raider Reputation quests only reset once over the last couple of weeks for me. They simply will not reset for me 🤷‍♂️ while the others available every time I sign in.
---
What about grinding simulator that game all you go is grind
---
Were your weapons duped in your inventory?
---
Rule 1: dont drop stuff that's important for any reason
---
When they decide to destroy my camp when I've done nothing to them is griefing to me.
---
Its your own fault for dropping weapons
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
Have you played other RPGs? Do youI like melee or pistols, or buy guns, or snipers...etc
---
Bc I didn’t know what was wrong I picked them back up and nothing was wrong, I dropped the double barrel and that’s when it froze
---
I’m not suggesting that grinds are enjoyable but literally every MMO I have played has had a faction, gear, or reputation grind.  It’s just a parallel form of leveling.  IMO if you enjoy playing the game the grind is simply something for you to accomplish while you are playing.  Honestly, outside of the NW ones I don’t bother with, I feel like the score daily quests are barely an inconvenience.  (I do sometimes “cheat” by knocking out the leveling challenge on a low level ALT if I’m short on time). If you don’t enjoy your time in Appalachia anymore there is no shame in finding another game or experience that you find more rewarding.  Sometimes simply taking that break makes you enjoy the game more when/if you come back.  Chances are, much like the Atomic Shop items, we will see these same rewards cycle back in at some point in the future.
---
Story mode or single player games, yea sure. I agree. But online is a whole different world. If a new player suddenly got the same armor and weapons that a person that’s been playing since the beta came out. Do you think that’s fair? Not at all. 
---
The score missions and challenge, are supposed to be a race/challenge. To see who can actually make it and unlock their rewards. To encourage people to play and try new things. Not everybody is meant to unlock everything. If you missed out on certain rewards, that will “encourage” you to try harder next time.
---
Are you playing when the daily’s reset? I haven’t had any issue...I just make sure I’m not playing when they reset
---
I picked them both back up, I didn’t know the game was gonna freeze when I picked them back up
---
Yeah instigating explosive shotgun and problems are gone. Add troubleshooter on top of that.
---
No they weren’t duped
---
I does invalidate my clothes horse tendencies though.  I used to be able to justify them with “I might need this for a challenge.”   Now I just have...umm...pounds of clothing in my Stash.
---
Link to it in the top comment not the title, use imgur to upload it to and share from there.
---
Turtle tested this everything, but the Shrouded Wood Armor *doesn’t* work.
---
Repairing takes more material than crafting in the first place. Such a shit task.
---
Don’t do the grind then. I don’t. Of course when you don’t you’ll find that there isn’t much else left
---
That'd be the one! Thanks for your patience. I suppose I could have Googled it.
---
Nope. I make sure if I'm on around then I'll log off 11:55 est and hop back after 12:05 est
---
That's pretty much what I play with. I carry a mix of bloodied and junkies stuff. Have a mediocre bloodied build, not really optimized. I could squeeze more damage out but I hit hard enough. I keep myself under 20% health and do just fine.
---
You didn't mention mutations. Gotta have those. Adrenal reaction. Twisted muscles. Claws. All those damage boosting ones that make the bloodied builds so badass. They work for junkies too.
---
I like furious, too, in combination with the low health build. Sadly, furious has the same lack of synergistic perks/armor/mutations that junkies has.
---
It wouldn’t even let me drop radaways
---
It is Saturday at 8pm est not Sunday.  Be sure to buy before the Tuesday reset.
---
0 cap purchases don't seem to trigger the challenge. I got some stuff a nice person had put up for 0 last night and it didn't complete. Found something else for caps because I didn't want them to get absolutely nothing out of giving me that stuff, and then the challenge completed.
---
That is what I was thinking but I really want that radiation resistance for shadowed robot armour and Chinese stealth suit means you are giving up a lot of customisation and deep pocketed stuff.
---
I have no stealth armour and I can still walk up to scorched like I am invincible and I am not even stealth build, was it always like this or did they break stealth again?
---
Nothing else would drop so I was just seeing if it would work, I picked them back up so I shouldn’t have lost them
---
Like, if I create a new character, from the moment I click "New", I can be done in less than 15 minutes.
---
Loading screen, skip intro, wake up, grab pip boy, grab all the stuff on my way out, play overseer's tape, grab perk carks, ding level 2 (doesn't count), exit vault, Loading screen, talk to droid, talk to Lacey, run to the Wayward, Loading screen, shoot the guy in the head, talk to Duchess. 
---
But I shouldn't have to. 
---
(Notes:   -Pick Charisma when you hit Lvl2, to unlock dialogue for Lacey to give you a better weapon and ammo.   -If you don't kill enough Liberators or Scorched on the way to the Wayward, running over to the Overseer's camp and crafting a weapon and armor should be enough to do it.)
---
I think it's fitting for a stealth sniper. Even with good gear, if you get careless you die. Also helps a lot with getting your damage in if someone with a legacy shows up.
---
Change? It’s the core design lol they can’t change that
---
Yeah ill check it out, thanks
---
So of all the things you could have attempted to drop to "fix it"
---
You chose your favourite weapons?
---
Sorry but you had a big dumb moment there
---
No problem.
---
Am in the UK too, all links to the support blog go nowhere...
---
anyone who does this, i wait till theyre engaged in the menu, then slap back, kill them before they can tab out, and sell their junk.
---
Well I picked them back up so it’s still not my fault. Yeah it must’ve been a bad decision but how was I suppose to know game would freeze on me like that.
---
Could be lag.
---
What’s makes this game grind the worst I’ve seen is all the caps. I also just started playing Rust and that game does feel like a second job BUT there’s no caps on what you can do. You can play all day and absolutely achieve what you want. This game you play all day until you just can’t do most of what you want because of the caps. This game is designed to get you play daily but not too much
---
As of last week, you could no longer be herbivore/carnivore and reap the buffs from the opposite food. Carnivore could not get vegetable buffs, vice versa. Has this now been changed back? Allowing the buffs, just not the HP  boosts?
---
Hmm I should do this, probably even faster from level 3-4 etc, so many quests at that level will instalevel you
---
Ah, well there's always the thousands of ammo I sell for 1 cap a piece. Sell everything but Plasma cores, shotgun shells and gaus rifle ammunition haha
---
That's brilliant omg lol
---
How did you manage to play the Gamepass version? My friends on PC can’t log in... it gives a “no privilege” error or something
---
The whole perk card system is bad game design. TBH it would be better if they scraped it and went with something more traditional.
---
All ive ever played is cod and gta really
---
Out of curiosity, do you do the nw challenges?
---
Seasons in other games are usually tied to time played and/or XP progression. This game's pass is quite similar, but limits player's ability to choose how they rank up the battle pass and will be more difficult for players who don't have the most time to play
---
Actually I was able to keep the JE, I don’t use Quad double barrel anyway I have a QE one
---
I did the place camp down three times but none of the others
---
They have a chance to give a large amount of caps. That's why he had a lot.
---
Once you hit lvl 10 or so, delete and start over.
---
You shouldn't have to do it, but it gets the challenge completed.
---
Yeah it is, but was always intended as a cash cow for them from day 1 and it became one, you still can work around it but a pain. Use alts store extra weapons. I run 2 xboxes and 20 characters, so I can move stuff around easily for myself, but most will need to rely on friends or risking dropping stuff in world containers, but can be achieved. It's BS for sure.
---
I actually have the JE combat still so that’s a plus the other shotty I don’t use
---
Nope just too hard to find in large quantities. I can make the witch outfit on the fly.
---
Damn i didn't think of that. I have everything too! I'm gonna rock it today
---
Ive heard that doing the nw challenges first triggers the bug.
---
Its easy, straight forward, and stupidly OP. Of course its popular.
---
That not really an argument, saying a problem once were worse.
---
Idk why bethesda don't expand the stash to 2000pounds, it really don't make any difference at all in any way. Other than using a mule it would even make the servers more stable. Also, the carry weight can't depend on server stabilitybsince fallout 1st have unlimited junk storage, all of my friends have at least 100k of everything except flux. Some have millions of steel...
---
Since we now have items we can't even trade that are heavy like ss armor and gauss weapons, we really should have a viable stash space.
---
yea nice trailer. i like it xd. dont see much of those on youtube tbh
---
Or genuinely wanted to help and doesnt read these boards is more likely
---
fast travel out did not fix the problem. 
---
I'm not sure, if i'm at the same position. Room with the intercom. Gail, Ra-Ra and Johnny are in the room  behind the intercom. The door is open but I cannot go into the small room. Invisible wall. I can shout decals in the floor though
---
Out of cores?
---
The game needs -more- hardcore survival aspects, not to make the existing ones easier or irrelevant.
---
I wasn't arguing with you I was just stating a fact.
---
Just use chars
---
Empath (full class freak) when you are teamed with one other player gives the dmg protection bonuses to both players. The other player does not need to have empath. Confirmed.
---
What do you mean "special meat from bb"? Do you mean like brain from sb or liver? Im pretty sure i get these when using butchers bounty.
---
&gt;unlikely
---
Nope I have 4 unless the readout is bugged.
---
You have to not be on during the reset and ALSO not have NW be your last played mode when the reset happens. It's annoying but that way you shouldn't lose out on any score opportunities.
---
perma ban, they are violating the tos(qos?) and making the game dull.
---
Uhm no.
---
My mule has 1600 weapons in the inventory, 750 pounds of armor in stash and much more, and don't take any longer to load then any other char.
---
The game needs to -increase- the survival aspects, not decrease them
---
Whenever I notice a “problem” I have that “there’s a glitch in the matrix” moment and gtfo of there!
---
"You should feel lucky".
---
This is overlooked far too often.
---
You should feel lucky you don't have 400 stash anymore.
---
 I never once said you shouldn't have more than 800.
---
But cool man, keep digging.
---
ah, how do you have it already!! i'm five or six ranks away from unlocking it, this is the one i'm so excited about!
---
Fantastic, this means I might actually get somewhere on the board after all.
---
I saw some people saying that first you need to log directly on the adventure mode and avoid the nw/atomic shop and the legendary run on the main menu
---
Well, you can just get additional 25000 xp in Adventure, it'd take much less time.
---
I've never seen those at West Tec, seems like i've been missing out on a lot of XP if this is true ofc.
---
Hey, I’m like a level 5 or 6 (I’m not on now and can’t remember) do you still have any. Also I couldn’t find you by searching your GT in Xbox app where I was gonna ask originally.
---
Thought Turtle said that shrouded was broken or meaningless once you had a perk.
---
Pos
---
I'm kinda blind, I didn't find what you implied there.
---
That's the post where the duped items got remove, but nothing points to an "old idea of Beth".
---
And if you think it through a little bit further, I think you'd understand that Beth wouldn't do something like this. In order to make \*your\* idea come true, the RNG-code would need some serious work and account wide checks.
---
Which is actually impossible to implement, because you can have up to 5 toons. When you play, only one toon's data is read out of the database and into the active server. Now checking all other toons for their equipment would mean that their data needs to be read into the active server also. Increasing the server load by 5...
---
I had this pass my mind so many times i literarly forgot it multiple times to add in the perk inspirational.... Thank you for reminding me.
---
Nope sorry, it doesn’t work said it wronf.
---
I was steered away from it for a very long time because it felt a bit cheesy, though eventually I just got bored and decided to give it a shot. I loved it, it's actually quite fun, you kill enemies easily but you die just as easily if you're not careful. It makes you play the game in a whole new way.
---
They've all been given away already, sorry
---
What's the build you're refering to?
---
Just occasional grinding of the daily XP I guess, and abusing XP and int buffs. 
---
It's worth the grind, I am happy with it without everything else in the board :D
---
I do alternate a lot
---
No. 
---
[Here](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Shielded_lining) is a reference guide.
---
What time zone are you in?
---
I dont check any, i go straight to adventure. I was told the same so i avoided that and being on during reset but it appears something else may trigger it as well
---
If you want to troll bloody builds when joining a team, use and share the rad sponge perk under charisma and then use a few radaways. Do it until there is no more bloody builds. This build is the laziest build. Join as many teams that you can and do it.
---
Yeah I was thinking that it could also be a mod
---
Ah well. Nice of you to offer to people.
---
It's not really a challenge playing a full bloodied build. Like, at all. Even a half assed build like mine can obliterate anything. Usually in one or two seconds. 
---
So what does somebody do to make the game challenging? Become less efficient. But not too much. Cause enemies that are too bullet spongey are frustrating. The idea is to let them live just long enough to be a threat.
---
The idea of intentionally hampering yourself or intentionally not being meta doesn't appeal to everyone.
---
So should people with a questionable amount of camp budget be banned as well ? It’s an exploit of a bug so it’s against the tos
---
You’re welcome.
---
Buy &amp; sell? Jeeez, no need for "the community" a player-vendor does it just fine...
---
Youre better off crafting and scrapping them
---
yes, it is but it also adds at least some "survival flair" like, you know, limited ressorces.  
---
tip: get the bandolier perk rang 2 in STR. it reduces ballistic ammo weight to 10%. im carrying like 40 or 50k ammo with me, 3 guns, a melee weapon and have like 80/295 capacity used. it works quite well.  
---
(idk if batteries included works also up to 90%, but if you use ballistic ammo, its a great workaround)
---
Well unless I need something, what else am I gonna do? Stash is full, vendors are full, inventory is full...did those dailies...no story left...
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm enjoying myself, but I play max 2 hours right now while I have my morning hippie speedball. Probably 1.5 hours if you ignore the amount of stash lag and loading screens.
---
That's also getting ridiculous. Create alts for every challenge. Don't actually play the game...
---
This.
---
Also, they don't expect anybody to play after a few hours anyway.
---
Bloodied or junky?
---
or craft paddle-ball string
---
Foood
---
Quit whining and stop doing the NW challenges. It is a dumb mode anyway. It's been brought to everyone's attention on here 100 times. Duh
---
Oh three back to back wins you say. That sounds like the average game day for the average player...
---
Also, nope not unless those were like 1500 xp wins
---
Wow you’re feisty. Guess you’re a fun ruiner?
---
Um... 10 (not 9) on the board give 150 and level 100 gives 500. Count again. Go into the game. Click on level 100.
---
Ievels, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 51, 60, 70, 80, 90, 90 all give 150. 
---
Level 100 is 500. 
---
Total is 2000
---
All the flying shit being flung would coincide with all the shit fo76 has to offer.
---
It's what I've done. I've gone back to Fo4 since I never finished it. Fo76 was the second mom game I've played since the original WoW. The same thing happened with Fo76. I got the general idea of what the game's about. Got bored, and then shelved it. I felt like I should have been paid hourly to keep going. This wasn't a game for me so much as a time theif.
---
What?
---
I feel you, both of my two main camps are near the new colossal problems event.
---
I've been using a lot of Zealot's since I hate PA and I'm a stealth build. Might as well max the tiny amount of damage I can peg the SBQ with, or scuttle around cleaning up hordes.
---
My problem is that all my mules got leveled up during extra xp weekends. Now my lowest level is 104.....
---
Perk loadouts are coming
---
just to be safe here resets at 13 so I log only at 13:35
---
There are no good spawns for lever guns sadly, you'll have to equip Super Duper and Scrapper and just make a bunch. You wont regret it though, the lever gun is extremely good and seems really under rated in this game.
---
u/Ladydevann
---
My friend has been having issues like this since Fallout 1st came out. Any help would be greatly appreciated! He's messaged Support, but the solutions they gave have not helped.
---
Food build
---
The junky one. I mean, i know what they are but how does junky outperform bloodied? You mean because or the damage bug?
---
Same I didn't log out before it reset and they didn't alto compleat
---
What that mean
---
I did the same on Thursday, lost track of time, forgot to log off but didn't get the autocomplete bug. Just had my character in camp playing the piano.
---
That's what I did but it keeps saying I need permission &gt;.&gt;
---
Shh, don't spread bethesdas secret plans, or they banned you.
---
Try and get a Backwoodsman #3 as well. It cuts down the materials needed to make weapons
---
And can even be done on purpose.
---
No no bloodied is the best dps output in the game period, junky or stealth or bloodied/stealth is good Atm but not like bloodied trust me.
---
Made the mistake of not researching before buying this shit, well, another disappointment after the ammo converter.
---
The extra challenges are indeed welcome. I've had a good run the last couple of days and this will tack another little boost onto things.
---

You could be farming a long time if you want the best mods. Quicker and more reliable to simply buy the plan for around 1600caps and craft your own.
---
Yeah, fair enough...
---
You're a plum.
---
Take them out and put the stuff back in?
---
If you raise your Endurance Special stat you will get 5 hp per Endurance point. The Endurance bonuses on armors etc. do not give said bonus.
---
It takes all of 1 minute to double check that. I just did and it still the Endurance bonuses on my Shield Secret Service Underarmor do not raise my health. 
---
Stop spreading misinformation.
---
perma ban for dupers. soft ban for camp budget exploit. 
---
and fix silo exploits.
---
As far I can tell the bug is caused by healing factor.
---
I removed it once and didnt had a single fast travel bug for a week, but then it occured again, but way less frequently.
---
Also, speed daemon and some other mutations are causing this bug in some way.
---
On that note they should make it so you can repair at YOUR workbenches only for your junk. Buy repair kits as a way to keep yourself going but you should be able to repair without kits
---
The glitch worked for me still. It didn't for a while so maybe it's a sometimes kinda thing but it saved me slot of time. Loving to gauss minigun!
---
Radshield- +300 radiation resistance and doesn’t suppress mutations. Berrytats to highlight enemies. Delberts Sunshine Oil- +15 DR and +300 AP. Blight Soup- +20% critical damage if you change from carnivore to herbivore. Formula P stacks 3 or 4 times and increases gun accuracy, +5 charisma and +3 luck for 5 minutes
---
It's a fragile build, but massively overpowered in the damage stakes. There's basically nothing that'll hold a candle to it in raw damage output.
---
Despite the high damage, I've never tried it as I'm not a fan of low health builds, they just don't fit my playstyle.
---
I’ve missed this,what’s happening?
---
Was easy, I just took off gunsmith and used an explosive shotgun
---
It means your build is set up for convenience rather then combat. You should invest more into damage and reduction. Just from the pic I can see you have a lone wanderer you should be rocking. Typically you would keep combat and switch to things like hard bargain when you need.
---
Yes, they shouldnt cater to casuals, thats literally the source of most of the games problems.
---
But, what else should I do when bored?
---
"Our last working osmosis filter"
---
Fucking liar.
---
Huge dupe and ban wave. at least half of my friend list have shown me ban email
---
It did for me I'll test it when I get off work im only stating what ive personally seen not what i read off a post from a guy with less than 30 hours play time
---
You are completely correct and mistermyxl is wrong. 
---
Endurance stats on items still give no health increases. Don’t know what the other person is smoking.
---
There's a new dupe glitch doing the rounds and it's rampant. It involves the NPC vendors but I don't know the details of how it's being pulled off.
---
What are the bans for?
---
Harder challenges would be great. If you think that a challenge to kill legendaries is “feeding you shit,” then maybe it’s time to move on to a new game.
---
Not just damage, with full unyielding that up-to +15 to every special (except endurance) is insane.
---
Better XP.
---
Better max durability for found and crafted gear.
---
Better bot vendor prices.
---
Higher carry capacity.
---
Better vats chances.
---
Faster crits gain.
---
More AP.
---
They where like 2000 plus wins I'm starting to doubt you even play now what console are you on
---
Duping weapons. or other items.
---
Because that would seriously punish everyone.. the 1400 daily cap limit is bad enough. Make that 0 caps until the issue is fixed and everyone can't play anymore.
---
They're super intolerant. They shame you for drug use over a Radaway.
---
Durp.... nice one dunno why I didn't think of that 10mins saved cheers.
---
As an FYI it’s 14k more for the fur lined jeans
---
Well today it seems we have two extra daily challenges
---
Have you noticed the supervisors aren’t glowing anymore? 
---
I haven’t been playing long but I’m used to seeing the supervisors (legendaries) in Uranium Fever as glowing. But since roughly the Season started they just look like normal miners. Too easy to 1-shot them. (On PS4 if it makes a difference)
---
Ah,I should be alright,I haven’t bought any weapons,I’ve found them all
---
I have reset at 12 so i Am off before 11:55 and wont go back on untill 12:05 at least
---
Sure it is.
---
But like litterly everyone is duping. seems pretty stupid of Bethesda to leave them online considering they have taken then off for lesser things
---
I got that from a pack and I don’t switch my cards around
---
Repeatable daily and you bring black eye mirelurk meat each day. Either 10 mirelurk meat, 1 queen mirelurk meat, or some amount of soft shell I think.
---
Yeah I find I'm on mostly a single character now.
---
You saying the stalkers 33/50dr fixer I just got is ju... ok yeah... if only it was junkies
---
No you don't. I haven't killed a single NPC on a raider quest.
---
Make sure you’re using vats. Each hit in vats fills your crit meter. Once meter is filled, you can execute a critical hit. The more luck you have, the faster it fills up. Or getting a legendary gun with the ‘vats crit meter fills 15% faster’. Would help. I only have 8 points in luck, and mine fills up after only a few hits in vats. Depending on what platform you play on, you will have to press a specific button on your controller (once crit meter is full) to use/execute the critical hit.
---
&gt;litterly everyone is duping
---
Huge over exaggeration there. 
---
Collective punishment is never a good thing.
---
If it pops up again, take off all your crafting perks, craft a pipe pistol, and it should have base max durability. After repairing all my usual gear, I just fired off a few clips of one of those into the sky. Kind of annoying and 10 repairs is way too much for a daily, but a simple solution.
---
Like 5 repairs would be less egregious, in my opinion.
---
It's npc vendors, not player vending machines.
---
Any reason why one gets a harsher punishment than the others ? They’re all against the tos so they should be treated equally
---
Is this a console problem or both?
---
Stupid question but... do you have power connected directly to each vendor?
---
I’m always against utility perks being a part of the main build I only equip them when I’m gonna use them
---
Yup and I installed another generator as well
---
Alright thanks. This grind is grim.
---
Sounds like it's homesick
---
I hope they do something with him eventually, it'd give me a reason to actually go to Foundation aside from a single daily.
---
You get the normal 10% with it
---
I don't think its the case, cause it would be too obvious, but i gotta ask: Do the screens maybe run on diffrent resolutions and you normally play on the one you left at home?
---
Just do a quick run through Generals Steakhouse and you get plenty of weapons. Or make a level 1 board and go hit a tree a couple times; repair and repeat.
---
I'm on Xbox. Same gt as here. I'm always playing with new players it's my endgame lol
---
I play on PC so both i guess.
---
It literally is, this could be one of the best games on the markest if it fully emulated fallout 4's survival difficulty. Instead of catering to people who want to make an already way too easy game even easier, like yourself.
---
What system?
---
Sorted it. Had to exit PA, drop the cores and then pick them back up.
---
I have full unyielding, but don’t really fuck around with bloodied myself. I find I do enough damage without them, and I’m unwilling to pay the exorbitant prices people charge for those weapons. I have a handful of bloodied weapons I’ve found, but they’re just not as satisfying to use because I’m also unwilling to sit at 30% HP with 1 endurance and minimal damage mitigating perks. 
---
I’m usually at about 50% HP, do more than enough damage to 1 shot most mobs, and I can visually tell via health bar that I’m doing significant enough damage. Bloodied is like icing on a cake that already has too much icing, in my opinion.
---
You can damage a gun with bashing too.....
---
I saw a guy level 130 using exposive baits on the noobs on xbox game pass right at the wayward.
---
I got so much xp from someone doing this yesterday. It was crazy.
---
Not yet xD I still have a full clown suit a full asylum set and responder gear with a fasnacht mask and sunglasses on my inventory xD I don't dare to put it back yet in case there suddenly will be a new daily where it does matter xD xD xD
---
deactivating vendors is not a punishment. it's to protect the game
---
I used 34 diluted stims during the last event to kill the imposter taking all 3 pylons and using a vampire explosive 50 cal
---
Sometimes the game puts everything in your vendors back Into your inventory. Which unfortunately means you have to manually put it all back in.
---
Well now you went and made me look dumb. I mean, I am, but damn brother, thanks for the tip lmao
---
Tire iron with maxed weapon artisan cost 1 steel to repair.
---
Thanks man, you are god on earth
---
Are you serious? Bethesda is actually doing something about the dupers?
---
No it wouldn't. If you have another decent weapon or caps then you could trade for it on the market sub. Shit you could have the same 5 legitimate weapons amd it would take like an hour of trading
---
Not him, but I have somewhere near 30 luck with all of my stuff in a team
---
I tamed a Yao Guai and it just disappeared one day. Both a blessing and a curse cause it literally attacked everything except for attackers at my camp.
---
If you have the right perks and gear it's pretty tanky but the best part about it imo is the amount or xp you get with 40+ intelligence xD and not having to worry about AP when running xD
---
Good!!
---
I definitely feel that way. I treat it as a big game of hide and seek.
---
I have had some regular crits and sometimes sneak crits work for this challenge before the SCORE system, but none of my sneak attack crits this week counted.
---
Sorry in advance but I have not played fallout 76 for a few months what is score?
---
PC
---
Devs are changing it next patch-&gt; https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5AO20UhNUTb3WsBNM6fWXl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-ammo-converter-updates-purveyor-sale-and-more
---
Yeah looks like that works. My weapon racks are empty now too lmao
---
Once you take a ride on that bloodied dragon, it’s hard to get off again. Just be advised. ;)
---
yeah I noticed, I try to take double the caution to that
---
Lol sorry. I mean, it must have been because you had so much heavy ammo just taking up space, right?
---
I don’t know man, looks to me the grind is really self-imposed. I don’t feel like there’s something I ‘have to’ have, so I haven’t ground as hard as I could.
---
It autocompleted all my challenges so i wouldnt know
---
[x10 and x100 conversion options](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5AO20UhNUTb3WsBNM6fWXl/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-ammo-converter-updates-purveyor-sale-and-more) are coming soon.
---
If it’s because you don’t want to, cool. If it’s for the lack of a weapon, drop me a line.
---
It would feel like a punishment, would be a hugely unpopular move and would stop people playing the game at all until it was fixed.
---
If NPC vendors were off for the same length of time as player vendors, they would lose far to many players.
---
What they should do is put a message on log in that states they know when it's happening, who is doing it and that they will be banned. 
---
They could also make a legal case against people selling them for real money and make sure it is heavily publicised.
---
Sweet, I totally missed that post then, thanks!
---
TBF the first 5 people I met did weird shit like trailing me or just shooting me in the face over and over. That was not a fun first server.
---
Yeah totally that’s totally it and no other reason yep u right uh huh totally didn’t forget about bashing as a mechanic mhmm thanks lmao
---
I converted after unlocking the Gauss Shotgun, never looked back. it's powerful if speked out properly and is honestly over powered.
---
I have 500 levels between both my characters. I have zero problems playing. Eating doesn't make the game harder or easier. It's just annoying. Just like I originally said.
---
If *literally everyone* is duping, then I’ll ask you to please stop duping.
---
More expansion(s) will come in the future, too, Fractured Steel was already announced. People may want to play the future new content, but by that time the game might no longer be on Game Pass, so they would have to buy it. For this type of game, less than 2 years after launch is still fairly early as well, ESO is 6 years old, and is now more successful on Steam than ever. If FO76 keeps being expanded, it will be more attractive to buy in a few years, more content for the same money, and more demand for a Fallout game when 4 is already old but 5 is still years away.
---
Start menu &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Click on Fallout 76 &gt; Move
---
It's been that way for over a year now, bloodied is the clear best choice without any real downsides. Between nerd rage, serendipity, the massive stealth/AP boost, and emergency protocols, you become nearly invincible on top of being able to one-shot most enemies in the game. With all the nerfs bethesda loves doing, I'm shocked that they still haven't done anything about the ridiculous amount of synchronization that bloodied gets with...pretty much everything. The legendary perks are a start, but they removed one of the best non-bloodied alternatives before they even launched. Like, comparing a bloodied build to anything else is pretty much the same as comparing the old TSE to anything else, and it only took them a few months to sink that to the ground
---
I would really love to play this game, now it really looks interesting in comparision of how it was but its unplayable or atleast it was, i would like to know bot no one is answering😤
---
Same when your done early with the season. Right now, even if you hit t100, you still get score challenges. Let's say you are done two weeks early then you don't have a reason to log in for two weeks if you are endgame and beat the game already.
---
Try to go into dokuments/my games/fo76 folder and find the fallout76 ini file. You can open the file and change what screen you use. Or just clip it and put into another folder for when you get home again. The game will make a new ini file if it's missing from the fo76 folder. It will then reset all grafic settings, sound and key bindings. When you get home just pop back the old ini file. Hope it works 😁
---
I threw grenades at my feet to damage my leg armor a few times
---
I skipped that one. I'm not wasting all those screws and or adhesive for 250 score.
---
Has this been confirmed?
---
I found another fix. Apparently not having the game installed on the same drive as your OS can cause this problem. Mine was on a different drive, I reinstalled in on my C: and it works perfect now. Hopefully this helps!
---
All FO76 events and timings available here : https://reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hmv9cz/fo76_shared_calendar_resets_events_maintenance_etc/
---
Kill 7600 creatures in nw.
---
Not confirmed, just speculation and suggestion
---
ah, now I get it. I didnt know about limited amount of caps u can have. it kinda makes sense now. thanks
---
Yup; it's a welcome change for July; I finish my dailies and then go off to play some other games I've been neglecting.  It's nice that the calendar came out so we can be sure there's nothing new for the month and enable us to play out other activities.
---
You have zero problems because they keep catering to casuals like yourself, which is why the game has gotten easier and easier.
---
Well I don’t have any other perks I use so I just leave it in
---
Was it scorched? I had a scorched mirelurk hunter who did nothing but attack a razorgrain bush all day long.
---
Well for his case it may be a visual bug. But mostly Theres a issue with the challenges that doesn't give you the score altogether since its already been completed. That's most likely what we both have going on right now
---
That happened to me twice with my new character but the third time it worked. Maybe they tried to patch it.
---
They are not overly difficult.  Just tedious.  Yesterdays NW 6 stimpacks was the first one I thought screw this.  
---
The teams INT boost and 10k XP really helps so I'm glad about that.  But you have to remember people are different levels.  Legendary kills will be hard for low levels.  Levelling up will require more time for higher levels.
---
This should be a feature as it is on most build-based games really.
---
They changed the daily rewards from atoms to something called SCORE, which is similar to xp. There's kind-of a mini game now with a game board and a reward on each square. Earning more SCORE moves you skiing the game board and unlocks the rewards.
---
Kill the scorchbeast queen.
---
I still wait to see this challenge. Even a lvl 40 can deal enough damage spending 200 bullets to get rewarded.
---
Hey mr dong, just wanted to say don’t give up. I too was in your shoes. Until I finally hit ally, and unlocked my sweet gauss minigun. It’s definitely a grind. But it feels real good, when it’s finally over.
---
I forgot that's even a thing due to how long I've been using the loadout manager. I have a hard time believing how console players are able to stand all the ridiculous nuisances in the game, it can get too much even with all the measures PC can take to minimize them
---
Oh thanks and That sounds fun
---
Because it makes no sense to punish everyone for the actions of a few.
---
A few that I've yet to see, in fact.
---
Ok pro gamer. You toss out casual like it's an insult? Please. Food mechanics are easy to figure out. And it's annoying. sorry my opinion got your panties in a bunch?
---
Not that I would encourage it, but you know you can do it right back? Yesterday I was using someones vendor and when I was done I got flung off a cliff by a trap, so I evaporated his base with bait. You don't have to take it lying down, is what I'm saying.
---
Wait till you try crafting the new legendaries, or have a fast travel bug, or get dc'ed during sbq, or have the vats missing shots bug, or the overencumbered upon death so now your ass has to go back to vault 76, or any other shit in the game. The game is just one huge bug/glitch disguised as a fun game. Yes I know fun is subjective but this game is test of patience, it is not fun. Fact.
---
Yes, I saw there were 2 extra challenges to complete today.
---
Soon, there would be posts saying 2000 isn't enough. There is never an end to anything like this other than unlimited storage. Until that happens, no limit will satisfy people.
---
Good shout never knew that
---
Exactly I’m all for them doing damage and the challenge but I’m more afraid of gutsyies then a sentry bot or deathclaw asualtron packs of ghouls giant bears.etc.The list goes on I honestly think they got the numbers on that burst rifle thing the gutsiest have wrong cause compared to everything else it makes no damn sense
---
Same thing just happened to me lmfao they had to have done this on purpose
---
I mean, it literally is an insult. Catering to your type kills games. Its happened time and time again to multiple online games. 
---
And hence why they should increase the survival mechanics, and probably remove most of the random food spawns.
---
Just Took over a Workshop which is one of the Dailies, didn't take over a Workshop since at least 2 days ago (for weeklies).
---
No SCORE.
---
It was scorched, yeah. Also dropped dramatically in level when I moved my camp lol
---
Doesnt work
---
When I equip the suit I lose nerd rage can you tell me why then
---
According to the canon the prototype is obtained thanks to the plans found at the base of the anchorage simulation, that's a long time later
---
That doesn't mean you can't attempt to be productive. Just say the last time you remember and speculate when you dropped it.
---
I have a lot of fun with my junkies build too. I go through a tiny bit less ammo with my bloodied character, and if it weren't for unyielding armor bonuses I think they'd be almost as popular as bloodied.  Either character can very easily solo a habitat in project paradise.
---
You need a nap.
---
Then expand it again. Where is the problem except less people buy 1st, which is non of our concern? If the comunity doesn't call for action nothing will happen, and guys like you aren't helping at all. If you are fine with 800pounds it's ok, I'm ok aswell since I have two accounts. This still don't change the fact that every player struggles.
---
It shouldn't require a perk, chem or mod, it should be built into the game. Looting shouldn't be difficult.
---
Pretty sure it'll be like the mod in FO4 where you'll get a door or perhaps a special item you place in your camp that when you use, loads you into a separate instance. Once there, there will be 4 floor tiles and the door back out and just empty space to build in. 
---
Can't wait for this myself as it's bound to increase the build budget by a lot and make camps even better.
---
That'll do it. Anything scorched just acts batshit insane once it reaches your camp, attacking stuff endlessly but never doing any damage. I did get a funny picture of the mirelurk spitting acid onto my collectron's pod, though.
---
They also take forever to craft, at 7 spikes each time. That is why I buy all the ones I see at vendor.
---
And people like you need to stop trying to kill games.
---
I have the plans they just take 10 screws 12 springs and I don't really have that kind of resources
---
WoW rep gaining was like hell..
---
That's why I think Red Dead's model was a bit better for pass leveling. Every time you get experience your pass experience goes up. It's not 100 per 10000 experience. It's just experience earned give a little pass experience.
---
I think the daily chore would be lessened if we weren't forced to 100 percent of our score from it. If we could just do what we want and earn score; it'd be better. 
---
Wanna quest? Get experience and score. Wanna kill? Get experience and earn score. Wanna craft? Get experience and earn score.
---
I have on one of my characters. Every workshop shows up as a standard location instead of the workshop icon. It's annoying.
---
Yes! I loved listening to the Silver Shroud Radio and “The Murder of Mayor Murphy” I swear I’ve heard it thousands of times and I still love it. Though I’m pretty sure that one radio show was a crossover story because the Mistress of Mystery is in that one
---
But maybe these ones would be more “West Virginia” themed like The silver shroud vs the mothman or the grafton monster or... something
---
Sound like you have DNS problem with your internet device or your ISP has a blocking filter to Bethesda servers/location.
---
With EE everything works.
---
That is amazeballs
---
They're way more attainable than the previous set up.
---
Eh. It's already so fucked that another wave isn't going to ruin it any further. It's already sunk beneath the bottom of the barrel by now. Many people refuse to even trade for anything and only use what they themselves found because it's the only way to guarantee it being a legitimate item. My only problem is that some people here still condone it or even encourage it. Every single time we have a new wave of exploits or hacks, I hope with all my might that bethesda stops being a bunch of cucks about banning people, but so far that's yet to be the case. And every time it fails to happen, people are just more encouraged to cheat next time because they know nothing will happen to them. Most if not all of the people sharing tutorials on how to exploit show off their account info and fallout 1st memberships. It must be quite nice to feel so secure in cheating that you have nothing whatsoever to hide. It's like a mobster town run by the mafia that can commit crimes in broad daylight without a care in the world because they own the police
---
I’m level 30 on score, am I on target to get to 100?
---
Lock your doors
---
F
---
I wasted them too when I first encountered them. They got on my nerves.
---
I'm sorry to hear that. Wish you a better day tomorrow.
---
You can completly do story with friends. The heist is very coop friendly. Then endgame you have every single event.
---
If they can't play nice than take away the toy. You said you don't use it anyway, if they can't appreciate it, don't give them the option.
---
They all use your username.
---
Run through fort defiance and pick up the desk fans and typewriters off of all the desks along with getting the desk fans from sugar grove. If you're feeling ballsy you can also hop for wendigos/megasloths to loot screws off of those. As for springs, sugar grove has a room with literally like 40 clipboards.
---
All rep found [here.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations)
---
I just bought it a Charleston Station. I think it's like the plan for the blue neon lights. It only has a chance do "spawn" in a vendor.
---
i might try that for silo runs with my melee character.
---
I did try ricochet the other day and it was humorous. 
---
thanks.
---
That explains my cranberry relish dilemma damn meat eater that I am
---
Or somehow not being able to find 5 pieces of bubblegum when you need them?
---
I would use a build planner if you know what you’re looking to have when you’re at end game so you don’t spend your points and make leveling any longer than you need to
---
If u run melee make sure u hack the torrents b4 entering the rooms
---
I'm not sure if they had exactly this planned from the start, but I am positive they had some intention of adding more. The double daily week was just one thing. Before they even released this season, they said that since this would be the first one, they would focus on monitoring it and making adjustments for the future
---
Thinking about it. It really is a silly complaint and the thing is out of the way where I'm not going to accidentally walk into it but still, common courtesy and all that.
---
Hands down. It's ridiculous to me that Bethesda acts like this is something hard to do when that mod has been around forever. I hate having to do this NW challenges because I have to disable the mod and then I always forget to re-enable it.
---
Dang. So it doesn't even really matter what you name an alt? Kind of funny though, if anyone does recognize my name they'll notice how much lower the rank is.
---
Thats the issue. Being online within the 30 minutes before and after the reset is what seems to be causing the issues for people.
---
Remember when the season started how everyone was freaking the fuck out about how hard it was to get score and how the entire system was purposefully designed for most people to fail so Bethesda could turn it into an easy cash grab?  
---
And now most people are even ahead of the "math" people angrily did at the start to prove how impossible reaching 100 was and they're throwing extra daily and weekly challenges at us and we haven't even hit either of the bonus weekends yet.
---
never!
---
I have a real challenge with quest/tasks that require us to use our limited, hard to gather resources. How many screws do you have to use to repair 10 weapons? How many caps used to travel?Talk about pay to play. Oh wait! I get a skin. OR flying saucer. yah...
---
1 piece so far for me it's a slow process
---
I am at a loss. Have you tried to drop the PA and reclaim it?
---
Doors? I don't have no stinking doors.
---
Yeah the radio station was obviously pre-war, it seems like Kent just gained access to it (If he didn’t already have pre-war access) and started using it for himself. The guy loves the silver shroud, he probably listens to it himself
---
Nah, its just being online within a certain time. 
---
I usually log on each day and go straight to NW and I've only had my challenges auto complete once (when I was in adventure mode during the reset)
---
I like my full heath character way more. I don’t even use any armor. That’s when it’s really fun and challenging. Been playing that character for 380 levels. So nice not having to repair armor constantly.
---
Im only logging to do them along the daily gold quests. Then play a bunch of NW matches before moving to another game
---
They are awards for completing certain challenges.
---
You either complete them and get the rewards or you don’t. 
---
Not everyone is going to be able to make it through the bored... because it’s not just participation based.
---
yes, i am very serious. for that moment i didnt know that our caps budget is limited.  and of course it is so difficult to explain.. but answer my question with another question or 2 questions. 
---
&gt; No one can currently access the contents of your stash through your vending machines, other than the items that are for sale in the machines. 
---
I didnt ask o say anything about accessing the content of my stash through vending machines. I asked WHY it is not possible to sell items from my stash no mater what. 
---
please, dont waste ur time sending another comment.
---
they probably still think the game is a pvp grief-fest because of all the people saying as such on the internet even though they havent played since launch. i doubt they'd be playing at all if it wasn't free via game pass.
---
I've noticed that on PS4, too. Several crouch behind things thinking I can't see them. Or flee.
---
What are you a cavemanwe all know the optimum way to build your house is to model it off of a mcmansion in the suburbs and to build it out of brick or contemporary walls

Had to drop the cores. Back to working order now. God knows what caused it? I cant live without t65 and emergency protocols😁
---
That would have filled up before I even hit level 20, yeesh
---
I used one this morning and made soooooooo many guns. Used like 600 screws or something. Worth it though as i now i have all handmade and lever action mods unlocked plus close to all unlocked on several others.
---
But I don’t know what I looking for
---
Same. I like how some camps put valtboy pointing you in some direction. Many times I’ve spawned into a camp that’s set up like a labyrinth of pointless shit. Okay looks cool, but do you seriously need 4 rooms of mounted heads and displays of all your Nuka colas?
---
okk. So powering up ur vending machine is just to show in the map where ur camp is and what u have for sale. thanks.
---
Yeah I haven't encountered much griefing
---
I do wish they would make it so you don't drop your scrap when you die and I hate when play ers steal it
---
Thanks ill give this a shot
---
I completely understand, I have random players turn off all of my lights for whatever reason, hard to see in the Mire otherwise most times. I get it, fun for them, but it is fairly inconvenient once in a while.
---
many events like Scorched Earth, Encryptid, and Project Paradise are intended to be played with multiple people, so there's that. the main quest is more solo-focused but you can play it with others if you choose, tho in instanced interiors only the team leader will get credit for completing the quest.
---
Considering 30mins is what we got for just a daily, itd have to be at least 60mins for a repeatable weekly.
---
This happens to me constantly in Uranium Fever. Tag the legendary, wave everyone over aaaaand first guy round the corner just one shots him and takes off. Great. Now I look like the asshole.
---
Is it safe to use the mods? I don't want some random Bethesda ban appearing on my account just for trying to get better QoL :(
---
Yes! I feel like people that haven’t tried it yet don’t understand that part. It’s like fo4 survival. Except when you get optimized dying is less and less. My bloodied is pretty rounded out now and I don’t die any more or less than when I ran with full health. So to me it’s a no brainer. If people’s complaint is the low health they obviously haven’t tried it with all the necessary perk cards. My only complaint is it’s too powerful, like way too powerful. It does make the game feel stupid easy after a while and I love playing fallout for the challenge so it sucks that I’m sort of losing that. As a bloodied user now I hope they nerf it, remove unyielding or buff the other builds to balance it out.
---
What's better a sniper or a tank? It depends on what type of attack strategy you want to run...
---
I would plan it out, it’s honestly a big waste of time respecing after 50 if you decide you want to move points over
---
I’m just naked all the time now.  Some may judge, but I like how it makes me feel
---
This was proven to be incorrect its bethsda just being pricks to sell subscriptions
---
Well there goes all that math everyone struggled with
---
My nuka cola machine is always stocked with vintage nuka shine. I put letters on it that say “get nuked” 🥳
---
there has to be some consequence to dying, and losing scrap isn't that big a deal anyway. just stash your scrap every chance you get, there are plenty of stash boxes all over, like in train stations.
---
You ask me to answer your question, then say don’t make another comment?  That makes no sense at all. 
---
You can’t sell items from your stash because that’s not what your stash is used for. 
---
That’s what vending machines are used for. 
---
Now, did you mean that you cannot **assign** items into your vending machine while looking at the machine and viewing items through that interface that are in your stash?
---
Are you getting an error message?  What happens when you try to do this?
---
See, you want answers but aren’t giving sufficient details. Unless someone happens to randomly guess what the hell you mean, you’re wasting your own time. 
---
Use clear and direct language and proper sentence structure to state your question. Provide some details of what you did to allow us to help you. 
---
You seem like the type to call tech support and say ‘how do I fix this’ but didn’t put anything on the ticket except **’thing no work good’**
---
What I don't get is why everyone wants to role play different factions as soon as some players want to play raiders and grief others, that's not allowed.
---
In my own experience BB price but only gave me the regular SB meats. It may have changed but that’s my own 500+ levels speakin.
---
Dope. Just started playing and was looking for something like this.
---
I’m 100% with you on this if anything camp glitch effects everyone more because it has the ability to make the server laggy. All duping did was make guns easier to get and make people who want to feel special sad
---
So salty
---
It’s a supposed feature they’ll be adding later in the year. I still anticipate they’ll fuck that up somehow too
---
claim a workshop x 1
---
craft 50 ammo
---
complete an event in a group
---
join a group
---
kill 20 creatures
---
kill 3 legendary enemies
---
level up
---
NW: increase overseer rank
---
complete 5 daily challenges
---
Yeah that's next for me, I think.
---
But I don’t want to move points
---
Not worth the money, but they gotta do what they gotta do, right?
---
Can’t remember them all but pretty easy..
---
Kill 3 legendaries
---
Craft 50 ammo
---
Level up in NW
---
Take a workshop
---
I had 2 level 7 s on my team fast traveled to both of them and dropped them a care package.  The least I could do as they were helping me level up 👍
---
Make a problem sell the solution it's predatory marketing, and what Activision and EA are known for
---
For we are all but motes of dust beat forth from his glorious wings and shall return to his embrace when we perish. May we all walk in his glorious brilliance. 
---
Fear not non believers for you have simply strayed from his path,  mistaking a mere lantern for the glorious full moon. Open your heart, he will find you, and under his wing, will guide you back to the Path.
---
it is pre wastelanders so there may be a few bits of incorrect info now
---
I put my Raider power armor on and chase after them with axe in hand shouting " Welcome to Appalachia!"
---
Yeah I'm always 50% afraid even of good news when it is Bethesda.
---
You bet there's gonna be a terminal involved.
---
A wood Board is a good one to repair, build one hit stuff repair repeat.
---
Man, apparently I'm playing this game wrong with my open air strip mall design.
---
I mean, go to shitty low level scorched area and kill the level 1-6 stuff and repair those super low level guns.
---
Oh you are doing it wrong if you dying, unless you not doing a stealth version?
---
Lmao that would kill me inside
---
I don't think there has to be consequences for dying but they could charge a respone fee or you would have to wait a minute
---
You mean Guided Meditation
---
It's literally in the pic too, mate. Not sure if it was always there after the patch or if it only shows up after learning the Jetpack plan.
---
Now my T-65 arms and helmet look pretty spiffy!
---
Once you reach enough gear they are nonlethal, I wish they were harder than currently.
---
Oh you're going to strip mall I thought you were doing acamp without any walls and just stuff scattered around
---
ah, yes, timegate respawning or CHARGE YOU FOR IT. that'll go over well.
---
just put your screws in the box before going out.
---
V.A.T.S. is broke right now!
---
If you have the stealth suit you can sneak thru it.
---
Strength dominant Unyielding is by far the most popular because of the high DPS. Honestly you get the most out of the game with an Unyielding build.
---
I would guess it’s a very small percentage of the player base
---
Ideally you'd want all three cards at level two at least. So that'd take up six points of Strength. Depending on what other S cards you have, you may want more points.
---
IIRC, that was only one of many. (Only 1 from the Operation Anchorage DLC) The Mojave BoS’ most senior members also carried Gauss Rifles that look exactly like the Prototype, so the lore would serve to assume that they were readily available in limited quantities at the very least and not all of them were locked away after the pre-war events at Anchorage?
---
Just because I never got anything good in 2k hours of killing legendaries doesn’t mean I have duped. It means the RNG in this game is absolutely terrible. If someone has good items in their vendor then ima buy it no questions asked. The only “good” weapon I have gotten was a tse single action revolver. 
---
Getting safe crackers gear and under water breathing gear for 2000 hours is enough to drive anyone up a fucking wall. So yeah if there’s a stacked player or vendor then you bet your ass I will have no complaints of cheating for this game. Primarily because it’s being kept in-house for the most part. With duped the only thing to go on gameflip for is caps to buy more cheap good shit from players or their vending machines.
---
I mean if you're looking to sell...
---
It's really hard for some of the horde bosses, sometimes I have to unequip all weapons and punch a mole rat but that still almost kills them lol
---
Yeah my problem was running out of aluminum which I think a lot of those weapons take. I ended up using some repair kits.
---
You just didnt have anything they wanted mate, powering off just removes map indicator but you can still use the machines power or no.
---
I thought this too but I've talked to people here that weren't on during the reset and hadn't played NW at all recently have it happen to them. The one time it happened to me I played NW first thing after the reset so thought maybe it was related to that.
---
Definitely not worthless
---
Although i'm testing and it doesn't seem to aggro enemies
---
If you wait its gonna have to be awhile as all I have been seeing is legacy duped to hell rn
---
I know the 1 perception is getting duped, not sure about the 90rw. I'd say hold on to it. Bethesda might wipe like they did with the first weapon dupe.
---
Read the edit
---
Is there a Settlers exploit?
---
Yes i play on a 1080p monitor but this one is 1600 x 900. I think its trying to open on the 1080p one so it closes when it cant do it there
---
Yes lol
---
You can also bash parked cars with any ranged weapon. I also ran into a lot of over-repaired drops.
---
1st is platform specific. not just consoles, but on all PC platforms as well. buying 1st on the Bethesda launcher wont give you the benefits on Steam.
---
I think I've got a quad double barrel shotgun in my stash still if you sre on xbox.
---
Dont listen to this guy.
---
It's the same on Xbox too
---
It has changed I regularly get 2 from scorchbeast and 3 from the queen.
---
The low health becomes just like running full health when you have all the right perk cards. You don’t die any more or less than running full health. I finally caved and became bloodied after being full health for over a year because i didn’t like the playstyle either. My playstyle after switching is exactly the same yet I’m doing stupid high damage and have jacked up special stats from unyielding armor. I play stealth rifleman so after switching it was a no brainer for me. Not trying to convince you or anything just wanted to share my experience.
---
The problem is that I haven't had a need for caps or the big ticket items most people go for, so I've never considered getting rid of it. The only thing I really want is a Red Asylum Outfit because I sold mine to a vendor a year ago before knowing it was so rare. Haha
---
You have move cards and perks around. I switched my second character to a dedicated commando/rifleman build and went from 10 strength to 3. Those points into agility.
---
Yeah, that's what I figured. I'm guessing there's no hope that the duped items will be removed.
---
Oh cool that’s good to know. Thanks dude
---
Despite its wonky VATs glitches, I love my current gauss rifle and play it 95% of the time.  I would enjoy a few more options on this gun style.  I don't know what the Prototype rifle is, but bring it on!
---
Unrelated, my gauss rifle is not a legendary.  I've been playing for months and never had a starred one drop or rolled from the purveyor.  Is it possible, and if so, how rare?
---
I actually need help with getting the code as well.
---
I think the 'survival' element makes people assume it's like other survival games, ie 95% of people constantly murdering everyone on sight for no reason.
---
It’s not worthless at all, you can still get basically anything you want for it.
---
I concur.  Most of the time I pretend to be looking at their camp if they’re standing there watching me; don’t want to give anyone the satisfaction of keeping me lost. 
---
But by God I’ll still buy your stuff if it’s worth it.
---
I used the Contemporary porches to make a two wide bridge with a T junction across a river. My shops, Beckett's bar and the obligatory Red Rocket/Slocum Joe's cafe are built off of the bridge with an open bus stop looking structure housing my benches, power armor station (another thing I don't use being a CSS invisible asshole) and my shower. Little 2x2 house in the corner so I can sleep, cook and watch tv.
---
Ah i was confused because you said junky has best dps
---
Just built lots of stuff and put various scarecrows in a circle aroudn that stuff. Didn't stop the "stuff" from being attacked
---
Hopefully we can get a mode for people who arent fuckin casuals.
---
So much wasted adhesive
---
Would be nice to feel confident enough to drop 70lbs of pre-war foods and clothing from my stash...
---
Join a group.
---
Damn these challenges are getting challenging.
---
There's a C.A.M.P. placement joke in here somewhere.....
---
Not a suggestion at all, just an observation of how Bethesda 'fixes' problems. They'll do something that likely hurts everyone playing whether they duped or not. More than likely they'll just disable vendor bots until they figure it out.
---
I'm half expecting them to completely remove all legacy weapons after this. All those gat plaz are going to wreck servers during Queen 'fights' (lol) and then it'll be worse when A Collosal Problem gets a full release.
---
People got really bothered by this dumb post, huh? Probably because they know BGS would actually do something weird like this. 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Go to a lake and drop em and leave the server
---
A tip I learned is to bust out the camera.  It'll tell you what's around
---
Also one of the Dailies that was completed was the Gold Star Daily, the one that REQUIRES doing the other Dailies... So Super Bugged Out.
---
The only Dailies I had that weren't done were Craft 50 Ammo and Kill 20 Creatures, in which as OP stated was already at 16/20, and it completed when I took over the Workshop to test if it was just showing them Greyed out, but still worked, but no, it's just bugged out completely.
---
The one thing I really hate is the people with trap camps. I had some caps to spend and someone was selling hardened mass at 30 a piece. I spent about 450 caps only for the camp to somehow spawn 50 punji boards or whatever and annihilate me which dropped my junk in a loot bag. The owner comes and I msg him to explain what happened. And he cleared the boards and TOOK ALL MY SHIT. Msgs me back and says thanks for the caps and loot 😘
---
I was fucking fuming.
---
Shit someone already mentioned this
---
If you are on PS4 you can give them to me. I have a rock solid way of disposing of them......
---
Good call.
---
So, if I move points into strength and bump it to 13-15 I'll be able to get the heavy perks in strength? They're just currently not available in my cards.
---
I woulsnt mind seeing a bomb shelter door that leads underground. Or even a manhole cap which leads down a ladder.
---
it is far from useless, an explosive energy gun is what is classified as an "end game" weapon, they are strong even if they are overly duplicated
---
I had this on first start I think. Something like "Your account isnt privileged for online play".
---
I restarted the game and afterwards it was working without a problem. He probably tried that already so I don't really have an idea.
---
If half your friends are getting banned for dupping,  you are hanging out with the wrong kind of people....
---
I'd do it, but I just don't have the patience to build towards it.
---
ha I seriously doubt it considering the dupe vids have like 500k views
---
Logic doesn’t matter to people who just wanna moan about having to work for cool items. I can literally on average complete all my dailies (discluding NW) in an hour and even the NW daily tends to be 30 mins give or take dependent on how stupid it is. If everybody could earn rank 100 easy then what’s the point in the season?
---
I'm sure you do lol.
---
Easy to mod on PC, probably more complicated on consoles, and they dont want to have different builds of the game on different platforms
---
Same. I had all the dailies except two auto-completed today with no score given.
---
not really. I have the best stuff you can possibly get
---
I specifically use a low level combat shotgun for crippling Bravos and tagging legendaries because I one shot even the Deathclaws in Radiation Rumble with my 2h main.
---
I don't think you want to trade this for a bloody handmade.
---
I got this same gun and ignored it for months because it was heavy and didn't fit my bloody unarmed build. Eventually I took it out for a spin without getting any perks, (but at low health), just to try it out, and let me tell, that gun is a MONSTER. (Try it, no Demo Expert, no Stabilized, no Heavy Gunner). Previously, I'd been running an Instigating, Explosive Handmade, (also without Perks), and thought it was crazy, but the BE 50 is a ton better, and you don't have to reload it all the time.
---
I just added the three first cards of Heavy, Expert and Master and it just rips SB out of the sky in seconds.
---
The only downside is you're going to need to relocate your camp to an acid node, to deal with all the lead ore you'll be pulling out of Lucky Hole.
---
Good to know. Thank you!
---
After doing numerous times during limited time events, I can say it’s when you start up NW first thing. Never go into NW first for the day.
---
I'm thinking I need more points into strength before I can get the cards I need.
---
Oh, yeah sorry, they can in display cases. Sadly they can't be put out as a board and pieces on a table.
---
I had a level 12 run up to my level 71 and start hitting me with a shovel. Doing no damage but starting the pvp prompt I stepped back and gave him a happy wave. He hit me again...I shot him in the face and took his 50 caps.
---
I generally avoid an entire hour around the reset just to be sure, but since I lost score after ending off a session with NW (and then I didn't do that again), I haven't lost anything. It shouldn't be happening regardless, but that's the best advice I have lol.
---
I dont use stealth, vats, or power armor. I just like to run around and shoot things and look for scrap or neat items to fill my camp with.
---
Congrats!! Funny enough, I unlocked mine in a very similar fashion. I ended up being like the 34th player downed or something. Had a whole four person group get me while I was solo. I made maybe close to 100xp when it said I had unlocked it. 🤣
---
What time zone you in buddy?
---
It’s a little harder to grind but it’s been working for me. I use tasty squirrel stew. It gives you 20% extra xp with carnivore. You’re gonna need some salt but that shouldn’t be too hard to gather up. You’ll also need two squirrel bits and when you are at white springs you can find 2-4 squirrels in the back near the service entrance. This will last an hour so usually the squirrels res pawn by the time you need more. I do not know if there is a way to craft more than one with super duper though. If there is a way I’d love to know.
---
Edit: also obviously get well kindered
---
https://nukacrypt.com/php/home.php
---
Im not. Why would I risk my account for an item I would never want more than one of?
---
All the sensible people got downvoted in here. As usual the angry jerks press a simple button to express their complicated feelings. 😂
---
Central US
---
I was online in adventure mode looking at the dailies as they reset, completed almost all of them. Hadnt even done NW before that, ever.
---
 [https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
Does it cost anything when  its left on or do you have OCD? Sincerely asking.
---
Or our complaining made them add more? 
---
Also what point are you trying to make here? That players shouldn't voice concern if they don't like something or feel something isn't right? Then the game would never improve.
---
Wow! I'm glad I hung onto it then. My only problem is I don't have the Heavy, Expert and Master cards. I'm thinking my strength is too low (8)? I want to be able to fully commit to the build.
---
Initially, the reason for the 4x4 shop was to make it mobile and have it so I can drop it near vendors or outside the SBQ (surprising I’ve never seen people try this) but for some reason I cannot just place it wherever I want and had to rebuild the entire thing several times due to a glitch not allowing my camp to be placed. Something apparently needed support and I read it has to do with items being over the edges of foundations...
---
I am UK or me and my mate would have joined you we love to drop a nuke. You run the silos much?
---
Fort McClintok (sp) also has a bunch of clipboards in the main entrance room as well.  Crazy number of clipboards.  While you are there, pick up the half dozen military ammo bags scattered around the base for ballistic fiber  too.  They all respawn too after a few days.
---
Things like perk loadout are ok to use and won't get you in trouble.  You can't use mods in NW but otherwise it's fine if they're things like that.  I even use the lockpick need rage "cheat" and doubt I'll ever see any action due to it.
---
I don’t need it I didn’t use it anymore I got the JE Combat and the QE Double Barrel the one I lost was a third shotty I never used since I got the JE
---
I usually do them alone.
---
Frankly that was the easiest part of the daily challenges to level up while for me and my friends. Off topic, we should get more of those outfits!
---
Unfortunately no. You have to get strength up to where you want it and then unlock the perk cards for heavy gunner too. I really don't like that Bethesda set it up this way.
---
This is where teaming up really helps...   I’d be happy to dump the load of broken weapons for ya.
---
I got a cool picture of them at the campsite for the daily photo opp quest
---
Ahh, gotcha. So a little more grinding before I can maximize the build around the gun.
---
There's a bug that prevents him from resetting and having more gold to sell, which apparently is triggered by visiting Smiley on anything other than the correct day and time. Mine is bugged right now. From what I've read, Saturday night after 8pm EST through Sunday during the day is the safe time to go.
---
i usually get them at fort defiance or camp mclintock in military ammo bags
---
You’ll understand once you’re in the end game
---
Are there any perks for having the ghillie suit
---
How did they destroy your camp?
---
All the fire bases, the training base, ft defiance
---
About to say the same ^
---
Edit:   Also, if you’re not cap strapped you can buy bulk from vendors. 
---
Finally, using the junk bot/extractor nets some
---
Dont worry about the haters everyone's build sucks at lvl 31. You dont even get to play the game until you're post 50 anyway
---
I started using this guide: [Ballistic Fiber](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a4r1sh/at_long_last_a_list_of_ballistic_fiber_locations/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)
---
Be aware that most of them were already empty for me till I went to a private world.
---
Good luck!
---
Camp McClintock usually has 5-6 ammo pouches, The Kill Box is usually good for 1-2, Camp Venture i have found 2-4
---
Yep. Bloodied is broken.
---
Well they will do something stupid. That's what they do best....
---
I wouldnt mind seeing a special cap increase but that would need a lot of stuff reworked. They could easily just fix the explosive legendsry effect to not be so destructive like how they nerfed the explosive effect in everything else.
---
And then when they AutoComplete on Update, I don't play that day. That's what we have to deal with in this Horrible Grind Fest!
---
Yep, there is double XP next weekend so that'll help a lot. Don't forget to join public teams to get extra xp during public events.
---
Ummm.... not the point.
---
git it more time then, it sucks but it's safe.
---
It's certainly.easier. we either do it alone or pair up as it's a little easier than a busy silo. Do you go in all guns blazing or stealth?
---
We use stealth as we have found it a lot easier. Silos have been bugged lately. Today I got through but my friend hit an invisible wall and couldn't continue it was really weird.
---
You can add me if you like I will help you no worries if I am on.
---
GT JustJuniorboy
---
I'm with you, but an extra of 500 possible points once every week isn't that much. It is still very tightly scheduled.
---
Coming soon to the atom store no doubt...
---
Neither.
---
Can't imagine why they would run away, you're so welcoming after all.
---
Do you play Nw?
---
Because fuck us that's why
---
Agreed.  Fort Defiance especially as people are looking for asylum
---
If you get lucky enough or grind hard enough for full ss unyielding your dr and er are so high theres really no worries outside of rads and poison
---
Wich is also false because we are time gated.
---
Drop them in a fissure
---
I don't think strength adds to heavy damage, so I think you'd be fine. Maybe move a point over if you want to max the three weapon cards, but I'd suggest messing around with it a bit with just the three main perk cards.
---
IN addition to what others have said, here is a graphical location of fiber.
---
https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Mappalachia#/media/File:F76_Mappalachia_Ballistic_Fiber_and_Screws.jpeg
---
Is that on Xbox? I saw a camp that basically looked like that yesterday
---
Maybe it's my head canon but I think I remember that Fallout NV occurs after F3, and those prototypes obtained from the simulation were brought to the Mojave with the BoS patrols.
---
BOOWM!
---
I am not sire I would want to pick them up .. risky as much as your intentions are good. But yeah just drop them in a bush
---
No, console users just don't have access to modify files. Sony and Microsoft won't allow mods. Mods are literally drag and drop and an edit to a config file. This is how Bethesda designed this engine.
---
Unless you have it hooked up to a separate switched connector, I don't think other players can turn it off if they wanted to
---
“Kill a wendigo wearing a clown suit”
---
Yeah i could see how he couldve been confused hahaha
---
no need to nerf anything. Just add a mr gutsy to every encounter!
---
I dropped them at the bottom of an unmarked pond and left the server. 
---
Yeah, I only picked them up so that someone else wouldn't get the idea of using them.
---
Why play any video game at all? If you aren't enjoying it play a different game - that's okay. But avoid MMOs because most of the ones I've played have serious grind... sorry you're getting stressed about it though, really, I hope you find a resolution of some sort
---
Appreciate the advice man!
---
I’ve been making a bunch of low level explosive bows to drop for the new players
---
It’s not people hating on it, just trying to save the guy some time. He’s end for a lot of unneeded leveling when he finds out he needs to respec
---
Oh so then there's 3000 scorched holiday gifts running around? No thank you.
---
The Game isn't Fun Anymore! :(
---
Unfortunately, first, I need to get those three perk cards. I'm a level 115 and have none of them
---
It would be cool that kind of entry is like Fallout 4 Vault 88 secret entrance
---
It has a switch connected to the front of it. That's the point it's always off until it's turned on by the switch. I wouldn't be complaining about people turning it on and not turning it off if there was no way for them to turn it on in the first place.
---
Why are you keep judging it on whether nerd rage is active, just go to your pip boy and check your max HP, is it increasing when you use the underarmor or not?
---
But only the chest having a deep pocketed mod is painful. How am I supposed to carry all this crap I don't really need?
---
You just made the point and you don’t see it. Genius.
---
I have been thinking lately about trying it, but I'm this close to switching my main character away from PA to a regular armour Commando non-vats build so I'm probably going to go down that rabbit hole first as I'll need to get my hands on a vanguards set for them. 
---
After being in PA for so long, I just don't have any regular stuff on hand nor have I purchased any of the Secret Service plans.
---
I know I was using hating very liberally
---
But my build doesn’t suck I already one hit white springs gouls
---
I'm 25 S.C.O.R.E. away from getting the backpack skin. Guess I better get back on and get more experience.
---
OMG, don't give them any ideas. Some of the people who work at BGS do come here and read these.
---
Floater grenades are dropped as soon as I get them now.  I have not yet found an effective use for them.
---
Maybe some player with high explosive perks find the good..

Yes it is it goes from 27 to 47 and I'm judging it by the nerd rage incase tour unaware only proc if tour below 20percent of tour nax health

Kink shaming isn't cool man
---
Double unyielding bug ?
---
I always log in around 5 a.m. never had it auto complete on me
---
This is my 3 game I have an account over level 500
---
I was a T65 PA bloodied build too, until I traded 2 legacies for a set of unyielding/powered/sentinel armor and never looked back.
---
If 100usd is enough for them to stay open then go for them i guess but there def isint a big enough player base to think this game is getting better
---
If you die in unyielding armor and choose respawn but quit the world you are in the next time you enter a world you'll get double the benefit. It's very useful.
---
How so?
---
I'm on pc. GT is nicholasnb1.
---
Right? Wood and marine armors already blend in fairly well, and it's like they forgot we can hotkey both clothing and armor.
---
Optimalization is not great but setting to fullscreen helped with that 40fps lock. So far it uses around 60% gpu and always over 60 fps on 1080p
---
I volunteer to hold some in my stash if you're overencumbered.
---
Best: Gauss Shotgun
---
Worst: SS Jetpack. This thing is terrible. Why do people love jetpacks so much?
---
Eh, I don’t get the fear that surrounds mr gutsys and bloodied. I sneak a lot, and if I get seen by one I’m smart enough to use my surroundings for coverage and wait to land a shot on the thrusters. Piece of cake. Assaultrons get me with a surprise kill from time to time but I’m usually alert enough to prevent that. When you go stealth bloodied nothing in this game is hard anymore. They should add or make some enemies sneak proof. An assaultron should be able to detect me no matter what.
---
That math would still be wrong. It would be more like 3 hours minumum per square averaged.
---
OoOoOoOoH, sounds......... useful. Is it banable though?
---
I have heard the freezer ones are surprisingly effective against SBQ But I have not tested it out yet
---
Saying 1-2 hours depending levels is a impossible feat after doing dailies and weeklies. 
---
Even grinding xp for the repeatable there is no way to even grind that amount of exp for a level up in the later stages of the seasons system.
---
No problem 👍👍
---
Remember when we had that score challenge auto complete bug? The one that’s been directly benefiting Bethesda for when the ‘buy a level’ mechanic comes in? What? We still do?
---
You must be one of those people who thinks everyones success relies on how you feel about what they’re doing. I’ve read your comment history and the point is that if you’re spending money on the game and so is everyone else, your conjecture and opinion just tells me you’re full of shit because that means a business can continue to operate, which is exactly what games are, a business.
---
If that song is force played in Uranium Fever, I would quit the game.
---
The entire Fallout soundtrack from 3 onwards is a 'trigger' soundtrack for me. I'd be a wreck for days if I heard it. I can have the radio turned off now, but no forced radio listening.
---
My camp looks very similar to this ps4
---
I'm at 29, did NW once and it cost me 5 dailies and a weekly so I wont be doing that again...
---
It was a truly perfect question.
---
Buy the game new: $60
---
Scour the internet for a Wendigo in a clown costume:  3 hours
---
Asking the question on the sub: priceless
---
Well feel cheated all you want. The grind was the same.
---
You asked what I thought
---
You can’t really get anything out of a fissure unless you are very lucky
---
The ones that have the rifle thing it’s a pain in the dick to kill them if your a bloodied build
---
I've seen her freeze mid-air on several occasions.  I was not sure of that was the grenades or someone with a cryolator.  She was taking damage from the players shooting her, but it was less than I expected.  I have not seen her freeze on the ground, yet.
---
I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised how it does with no perk support.
---
Currently lvl 149 and the closest I got to not earning it was getting lvl 145 to 146 in an hour of gameplay. Had to smash events and dailies one after the other and almost didnt make it
---
Maybe have an setting to not have it playing during the event?;)
---
I'll give it a go! Any recommendations on best way to get rads up and maintain them?
---
What the fuck did you even just say?
---
You should try hooking up your shower to a pressure plate. It's super easy to install and it shuts off as soon as you step off the plate.
---
lol no.
---

I ran a non-bloodied build for like 300 levels. Finally switched over after wastelanders launched and wish I had done it sooner.
---
Yeah my luck is 15. I had to resort to finding overworld spawning weapons because those aren't affected by luck
---
Respec into a stealth build. Nothing matters anymore
---
That's not a bad idea at all. Thanks.
---
Whoosh
---
B Fixer is more powerful by far...provided that’s what you’re looking for.
---
You are a monster.
---
(Also, pass along to me any legendary gauss rifles you get....)
---
No, but I prefer my Bloodied handmade over my Bloodied Fixer.
---
Fixer is better at range, but at medium to close range I think the handmade is better.
---
I went to the Bethesda Support and found this Page, seems it's an issue they have heard about... but need more reports about.
---
[https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a\_id/48324/kw/SCORE](https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/48324/kw/SCORE)
---
Sadly I didn't take a picture of the Completed dailies, it would have shown it was bugged as I had the Gold Star Daily Completed and the complete an Event with  a Party Completed, BUT I dind't have the Join a Party completed, so yeah two of the completed Dailies were paradoxes.
---
I'd be down with that.
---
It's a video game who actually gives a damn
---
Wow that way lower than on xbox I see what tour saying now
---
Mines not secret service, it’s mostly heavy combat armor, which isn’t bad of course, but my ass is so squishy I’ll still get 2 or 3 hit by ghouls, and when you’re fighting 6+ at once, it’s a real possibility. Still tho, you’re right, it’s a minor struggle and a niche weakness. Unyielding is pretty OP.
---
Im in the process of trying out unyielding. I also use the good old excavator fir junk collection and mining. I was carrying a shit ton of steel junk to feed the ole bloodied gauss mini.
---
It's entirely possible to make them still be difficult while not being straight up broken. There's no reason for them to be the way they are.
---
Nah there scraping by i know ALOT of people playing this game and Ive almost never seen people drop money on this game. Yet when I play league almost everyone i know drops 50-200 a month on stuff. Beth wants to use dumb tactics to get money when the only thing they need to do is provide a better game. I thought things changed on wastlanders but nah they only care about their measly daily inflated player count
---
Oh yeah, it isn’t hard - I’m just confused as to why.
---
Relocating camp today. Wanna scout around? I dont need help per se but id love company and backup
---
I also volunteer my disposal services, should anyone feel guilt and wish to rid themselves of any purloined goods.
---
I also have a switch for my vendors... funny enough I hadn’t even thought to turn them off when they annoy me.
---
best: secret service armor, I also enjoy grocers backpack mod which reduces food and drink weight by 90%.                          Worst: flares as they are useless
---
How about add 3 gutsys per encounter linked to each other, haha
---
You can find videos on youtube. From what it looks like, you find a laggy server, sell an item and server hop right as you sell the weapon then go back and buy the weapon from the vendor giving you two weapons. Its pretty shit that the dupe is still going on bc bethesda isnt tackling the core issues. Duping doesnt cost them money but I'll be damned if they arent working in atom store things.
---
Fallout 4 was so much better. I stick around just in hope that things will get better but it has been going on Two Years now and I am beginning to think that we are just stuck with this "Huge Grind Fest" and it is only going to get worst! The game just isn't fun!
---
&gt; I'm kinda blind, I didn't find what you implied there
---
Well my idea was kind of like this, but all the time:
---
"Players who had multiple copies of any of these duped items, whether they obtained them using an exploit or by acquiring them from another player, will find that all but one of each of those items have been removed from their characters."
---
I know they use word "duped" here, but they removed every duplicate weapons and armors if it was on their list, no matter if it really wasn't duped, because they had no way of knowing what's duped or not.
---
YES! YES!! And more YES!!!!!
---
They did. 500 extra score points can be taken today. Likely it'll stay around.
---
Nah, it's a bug not an exploit. Most people do it by accident.
---
that's.. beautiful
---
I lllllooooovvveeeee the jetpack.  I don't know why, I am constantly taking damage from jumping to high, even with the leg mods, but I just can't get enough of it.  I feel like a little butterfly!
---
Just got my rank up and it completed the challenge and gave me the rank reward.
---
I see people underwater or in a bush... They walk a bit away and kill me 😂 no love.
---
Ya, bridge can be pretty good, although it can also be hit or miss at times.  I've had matches where not a single orange crate spawned on it.
---
That was easy kill low level scorch and repair the loot. took me 10 minutes.
---
2x 250 extra SCORE available. Hopefully it will continue and lessen the grind a little.
---
In Path of Exile, which is admittedly a different type of game, each season adds new content with a new mechanic. In the recent Metamorph season, there were new enemies to kill and body parts to collect, after which you assembled a new monster with properties determined by the body parts and which was very tough to kill.
---
Sorry, to be answer your question, a Bloodied Fixer with even with 1* is better than any Furious effect of you are a low health build.
---
Yeah that would be a great start, but there are things like the marine wetsuit helmet that looks like it can easily handle some additional tech and perks.
---
I've been having this issue a lot too and I can't see to figure out what's causing it. I'm on XB1 and have tried to hard reset the system and restart the game a few times with no luck. Still digging for a solution.
---
That works too. You could rest, use a leader, eat brain fungus soup and cranberry all together. You could run that all to boost INT and XP. Not to mention the team bonus
---
Well that escalated quickly
---
I love the SS Jetpack. That combined with marsupial, speed demon, bird bones, high agility, and action boy, I feel like I am playing as Pharah from Overwatch. I just fly around and my action bar fills up so quickly. It is just so fun to be that agile.
---
Perhaps Bethesda are trying to make up for the lost SCORE which people have been experiencing.
---
Thanks for the feedback. I hope it doesn't bug out for me on the next rank as well.
---
just you
---
I miss the fatsnatch parade music...
---
Does using a mod like that disable achievements on Steam?
---
Just curious what Rank of SCORE would be on track as of today? What should I be at by tomorrow?
---
I am on my way. may as well revive me in water as it is part of the swimming badge
---
gt: rammadeus
---
Kind of a toss up for me.  I usually run Tank Killer 3 anyway, so I’d probably lean toward the Furious.  I’ve just never been sold on AA, but some people love it.  Run one for an hour then switch for an hour...which one felt better?  That’s how I do it.
---
I have a low level I camp out near a workshop.  Claiming and defending it usually nets you a level and the free turrets do most of the work for you killing enemies
---
I don't know man. Some are mid 900's but not usually over 1,000
---
Autocomplete still rough tho
---
That reminds me of the 'Battle Royal' Japanese movie that I watched back in the day.
---
I hope it doesnt too!
---
noice
---
Proof?
---
This is great. I do have a silly question though. Why do these changes come as surprises, ie are we speculating B is reacting to feedback or was this planned all along? Either way I feel like there would be an advantage for them to communicate more about this. Isn’t that the exact job of the community managers..?
---
I just dumped a lot of them in my stash this morning. So glad that type of challenge is over!
---
The game definitely needs balance. I am hoping the 1 Appalachia update will make bloodied less appealing because people will now actually die. Right now you can be a bloodied tank and that’s just silly. Perhaps then there will be some variety in what people play.
---
Alright, i guess ill keep trying. Thank you!
---
that’s fine since they dont even take their game seriously
---
If it's auto completed is that a bad thing? You don't lose score by any means?
---
That is really weird like I'll survive till top 10 with my ten and we sometime get like 900 when we die there but a when is usally around 1.4k to 2k exp
---
What level are *you* im 300+...so when you say it takes hours...im almost apalled that if youre lower level than I (and need less XP.to level) and its taking you hours and youre still not getting it...im wondering what youre doing or who youre playing with.
---
I hopped on today one hour ago. Already jumped 2 spots on the BP (34) and leveled up
---
2 SBQs, Line in the Sand and some crafting..was all it took
---
don't know what low level entails but i did it at level 22. 
---
also had the same challenges on my 240 and 22
---
10 each
---
I just did the rank up NW challenge with a new character an hour ago without any issues.
---
Agreed.  I need to see something to support this. 
---
Challenges are account bound, not character bound.
---
I have tank killer on at all times as well. So it does not stack with AA? Yea, I am just trying both of them, but it's probing quite difficult to tell which one is better they feel very similar. Thank you very much for replying!
---
Now that you have listed the dailies, can you please tell me how many of them are already autocompleted that way I will know if I should bother logging on or not.
---
Congratulations?  That's an entirely different challenge.
---
I'm having the same problem only when the darn thing is a little over half way dead, it fully heals again. Without mutating
---
Did you level up to 3? Because it never worked getting to 2.
---
I love everything about this post. Thanks for sharing lol.
---
If this is true this'll suck. I don't have enough time to play enough to level every day. I've been looking forward to that workaround.
---
Yea shows Bethesda name not character name.
---
Doesn’t help you today, I know.  But start doing all the Queen fights you can.  The event awards two repair kits that take weapons or armor to 160%.  One of my characters has over 200 of those things now, at 0.1 weight each I need to drop them!!   Once you start accumulating repair kits you’ll never need all that ballistic fiber again.
---
It will only give weapons usable for your level
---
This could've all been easier if bethasda directly addressed the concern and just stomped it out. Like hey guys we see you freaking out about score dont worry we're definitely gonna make it easier.
---
Are you sure that you just didn't level to lv3? Level 2 doesn't count as it doesn't happen in the game world but inside the vault. EDIT: It shows up on the challenge list on my lv3 mule atleast.
---
Big.
---
I mean if you want to see it for yourself just create a fresh character and you won't see the challenge in the list.
---
You will get level appropriate gear. If you are at max scrip, you can either buy a few, or instead get legendary modules for future use.
---
It’ll be you’re level.  Best to wait till 50.  But if you’re going to max out scrip then go for it - might find something decent to hold you for awhile.  Some weapons cap at level 45 too
---
joined your world but cannot see you. im in a building team if you wanna join that
---
A "detect corpse" mod for welding goggles would be cool. Put them on and dead things on the ground are highlighted.
---
Count me in, my PSN is Djimmysprinkles
---
I find that people who make claims are the ones who need to provide the evidence.
---
Not that fragile.  Berzerker is fragile and does less damage than bloodied.  It's kind of BS that bloodied builds give you lots of options for damage mitigation, but Berzerker doesn't.  Even at full HP, I'm more vulnerable to getting killed trying to do berzerker than I am doing bloodied.  Can't use PA and take advantage of emergency protocols, can't use any non-broken armor and none of the armor prefixes really have synergy with it with kind of dilutes the purpose, can't use any perks that boost DR, and the only way to get negative DR is to get addictions to certain chems...but if you're going to get addictions, you might as well just go junkies build and not hobble yourself like you'd have to as berzerker.
---
Did you say wipe? They never wiped a single weapon they did ban waves instead but it was not effective at all.
---
I will help when I get home. Whats your famertag
---
They already made preparations for ingame text chat before launch (according to what modders said they found in the files) but somewhere along the road decided to scrap it and rely on 'the platform's solution' which for consoles is their messaging system....but Bethesda Launcher doesn't have a chat option at all and Steam's chat isn't really implemented into the game. According to modders the internal chat system was almost complete and only needed hooks to connect to similar to the current voice chat provider. My guess is they anticipated some of the backlash beforehand and tried to cut costs whatever way was possible by not using the text chat servers of Vivox (the current voice chat provider) which could've increased the service costs for them.
---
No workaround. Just press the button/key assigned to that task. 
---
If it still doesn’t work, try restarting. 
---
What platform are you on?
---
Bloodied fixer if you're going for a bloodied build. That lack of ffr will definitely make less of a difference than using a non-bloodied weapon.
---
My lvl 10 alt got to 11 and it counted. You might wanna recheck.
---
They dont protect their own settlements, why would they protect your camp.
---
im at grafton station
---
Well the whole point of this method was creating a fresh character and getting essentially instant levels from the super easy starter quests, so it's likely the limit could be as low as level 5-10 just to discourage it.
---
Yes they added more. Today’s can earn you up to 2500 SCORE.
---
It always happens when I'm scrounging for goods
---
No. Unfortunately not; it goes up by 25 every space. Basically 100 will require 3500.
---
Bloodied builds... on the topics of fantastic things, the nukes and dragons F76 build planner is so useful, and free. Might give you some ideas if you play around with it.
---
Agreed. If the plan was to always increase daily score as it went on why not just tell us that at the start? That leads me to believe that this daily increase was caused by our complaining and not planned from the start.
---
Spending more resources to kill enemies doesn’t make the game more challenging.
---
I just grabbed 10 swords out of my salvagetron bin repaired them and was done
---
Gotta love wrong PSA's
---
That's just dumb.. it literally costs you nothing to take 15 minutes and go collect a few desk fans for screws.  Sell the rest of the junk you pick up along the way and you've made your travel money back.
---
Pay to play... lol smh
---
Because we're allied? A alignment works both ways. What do they acualay do for us except sell us stuff
---
Does Bethesda even know this? I haven't seen if they acknowledged it anywhere.
---
Is this a new problem? A friend of mine had this problem and it turned out that the mutations we had given them took away enough Agility and AP that they didn't have enough to even activate V.A.T.S. Had to get rid of most of their mutations.
---
What level would it appear at then?  That would be something to substantiate first before claiming so
---
That the challenge doesn't even appear for my level 3?  Yea, I'm 100% sure.  All that means is that they set the limit to at least as low as level 10.
---
😎
---
I’m gonna have to spam those
---
bloodied builds and junkies builds are the most damaged builds right now.
---
Oh man, I feel you on the floater grenades, they should not be worse than standard plasma grenades! 
---
And I love the farm tiles too, they look great! I just wish you could place crops closer together, the huge gaps makes you barely able to place 2 crops per tile.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Is Bethesda feeling alright with all this listening to feedback they're doing?
---
Haha anytime :)
---
The point? To have fun. I play games to have fun not to work. Work is for work. I don't want work in my games I want fun.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
I find that I'm just trying to be helpful and don't have to prove shit to you.   If you want to disprove me so badly then go do it yourself.
---
So why ask us to rate when you know this build is trash
---
I run a hybrid bloodied build that relies on one Unyielding while the rest is bolstering. Not the highest damage output or special output but I like that i can run solo or grouped with ease. More than viable without unyielding just not as op.
---
You'll be happy to hear it works from L137&gt;138. A real weight of my mind when that got awarded... 👍
---
I literally done all my dailies within an hour of playtime today... and I wasn’t even focusing on them that much. It doesn’t hurt to craft 50 ammo ffs or do an event. I will only agree though that the NW challenges can be a grind, other than that they ain’t an issue.
---
That’s not how it works.
---
That’s like me saying “unicorns exist,” now it’s up to you to prove me wrong.
---
Seriously, do they teach any critical thinking at all in schools today?
---
They don't take up the same space as normal perks, no. They have their own slots that you unlock at the level milestones; so at level 50 you can equip one of the legendary perks, at level 300 you can equip six.
---
I’ve had the same mutations on for a few weeks now. I can sprint for a good while. I press the button and it does nothing.
---
I’ve got adrenal, marsupial, speed demon, and healing factor.
---
This was my original thought, I just liked the roll on the handmade. Basically the only upgrade to the bloodied fixer would be a better bloody fixer or a bloody handmade?
---
It's the same with the planters. I loved the look of the mining cart but you can put 1 bloody gourd in there.
---
Speaking of vendors... Anybody selling any cheap handmade assault rifles on PS4?
---
I thought i was the only one.   
---

---
[https://i.imgur.com/jmX2iso.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jmX2iso.jpg)
---
I would think the fixer, the other is a great back up in my opinion.  When I go commando I roll with a J25 + 1A fixer and I just scored a J 25 +1 A handmade to upgrade my back up.
---
And does upgrading them take up an extra slot?
---
Formula q
---
The plans from the treasure hunter event are still rare, they were never around for an active dupe
---
I like the wetsuit because it means I don't catch dysentery when some water splashes one of my toes. I mean, I could go the full minmax route but diseases are just SO annoying to me.
---
The problem is having to do that every single day to get to 100 in time. That sounds like work to me. Actually worse, no one works every single day for 3 months.
---
Finally caved and bought one and the first one I made was a 2 shot with 50% limb damage. It's pretty dope
---
Went to low lvl player vendors and spent 200 caps on garbage broken guns to repair
---
Don't know if it's "popular", personalty I hate it, but it's just too good to pass on, esp with Unyielding
---
Massive STR buff + rads mean lots of carry cap
---
Massive PER means superior VATS
---
Massive CHA means you don't need berry mentats for shopping
---
Massive INT mean loads of XP bopnus
---
Massive AGI means better AP economy, sneak and Evasive
---
Massive LUK means critting every second shot
---
I tell my self I'm not a total sellout as at least I'm not using a Bloodied "Magic" weapon.
---
Only downside is.. being unable to do Radzone hunts without losing your Unyielding buffs.
---
good logic.  I've never seen a unicorn so I assume they don't exist.  I'll never see a post from you again so I'll assume you don't exist.
---
Anything that has a price ending in 99 is a bargain! Is this on PC?
---
Nope.
---
There’s still a few plans that are likely still rare but of course potentially still duped.  T60 plans, some ultra cite mod plans, barbed and spiked walking cane and a few other obscure low level weapon mod plans, but by and large i think with the old dupe and current dupe there are very few items in the game that are not potentially duped, or at least 1 degree off from duped, like mole miner pail rare plans.
---
You don’t have to play every single day. Pretty sure the initial math for this season has quickly become obsolete with the upcoming double xp period, lunchboxes, and double score on dailies weekends. i’ve missed multiple NW challenges and i’m still about level 31/32 on the season. The 10k score repeatable is easy to obtain.
---
Your example proves my point. "Take 15 minutes" to gather resources Time, (the most important resource) and materials that I then have to use to complete a task assigned. I would have used that time and those resources for something else. 
---
And can I ask a favor? Disagree with a point. Sure. Calling something dumb just because you disagree. Kinda rude. Not necessary imo.
---
Stop caring about how people play the game they paid for. Unless they are harassing you/you game experience in any way. Just go and enjoy your game, let people enjoy theirs
---
Still nothing on the old Atom challenges.
---
Sure they're only half as hard, but they're less than 10% the value.
---
The little mermaids
---
With all respect, You dont seem to get what OP and I are trying to say.
---
That being said, I do believe you are right. It maybe is time to leave f76 behinde. Since there is a Dupe Exploit up again the Market has crashed anyway and Beth. Does take it too long already damage is done.
---
we can combine them...
---
One of us! One of us!
---
How can i tell what the monitor selection is? I opened Fallout76 and it opened a notepad document. Theres also Fallout76Prefs and a few other folders
---
Been using my private to hopefully keep my challenges. No NW, no atomic shop, no checking legendary run, log out 3 to 5 min ahead, back on 2 or 3 min after, been lucky so far.
---
Im on ps4 by the way hint hint.haha
---
Best for me is the T-65 PA, worst for me isnt an item, it's the grind of buying 3 modules a day and hopping I can craft a the perfect piece of SS armor someday.
---
If they were listening to feedback, the 150 atoms marker would be every 4-5 places, instead of every 10-15.
---
I've had so many difficulties trying to get lower lvl players to stop running, to come to me, hold on, etc so I could gift them supplies and even weapons etc...stop running...look! See that?!?
---
Doesn't take a whole lot of work to damage your gear hell just blow yourself up a couple times or let a low level mob beat on you for a few seconds.
---
Mal should be mags auto correct
---
No where near close to maxing. First character and generally played quite cautious and avoided enemies where I could due to feeling underpowered. Only got like 250 scrip lol. Thanks for the answer though! Will keep ahold of my stuff until I am at 50 :)
---
You can glitch through too which I found out after doing it the hard way a bunch of times
---
You’re gonna have to log in and check yourself. It doesn’t hit everyone.
---
Fingers crossed
---
You're seriously suggesting that 15 minutes is so precious that you can't spare it to play a game we spend hours playing. 
---
Whatever man. I'm not going to try to further debate you on something so ridiculous. 
---
And calm down. I didn't call you dumb specifically.
---
Healing Salve for Cranberry Bog and The Mire. Probably the two rarest plans in the game. they can only be found in mirrors in those areas.

Fyi floater grenades are dropping for everyone since legendary run started.
---
Real proof that this bug exists, many here don't think it really happens.
---
awesome, thank you very much. fo76 community  is really helpful. :)
---
SWEEEEEEEEET!!!
---
So why wasn't that communicated to us at the start? It's almost like we were able to push this change by voicing our concern. You pushing back isn't helping anyone.
---
I would like to give props but I wouldn't want to over inflate their egos. A pat on the butt though. Good job. Lol.
---
My buddy and I were just discussing this today. In Uranium Fever, 3 legendary mole miners pop up. We always get a few hits and signal other people in the event to come share the kill. We had a guy level 398 who was staying at their usual spawn, one shot them as they spawned. It made no sense to try and keep a low level legendary 1 star to yourself when players under level 30 were there. I felt really bad because I had waved the lowbies over for the kill and comes over and smacks it. Just share the damn kills. There is no point in keeping the kill to yourself. You will still get a randomly generated item for your level even if 10 people share the kill. Don’t be a douche.
---
I feel guilty enough running a junkie build. The game is too easy to ever feel the need to go bloodied.
---
Except now you have to do 10-15x the work to get 50 atoms...
---
Good shit, exactly what i was looking for before double exp weekend. Thanks man and keep up the good work.
---
I totally disagree, as long as I get and it makes me laugh then that’s usually more than enough..
---
This explaining shit is an exception and I really don’t know what got into me..
---
Does it play constantly or just when someone is using it?
---
Brew some Alcohol, rinse repeat - less resources spent for far more reward.
---
Okay I 100% had this problem and the best solution is using a pressure plate! It only turns on the shower when you step on it/activate it. Saved my madness.
---
EDIT: Someone already put this in the comments, may bad! But it does work wonders :)
---
Honestly I'd rather create a new character than make the leap (Assuming you're a Heavy STR/INT PA build)
---
I really wanna doa PA heavy build and the thought of investing the.. 50 or so levels it'll takes to move stats, buy entirely different perks, farm money/bullion for gear for a spec I might hate and then having to spend another 50 to go back..
---
Meanwhile Levelling a fresh character with my current knowledge, better teaming and ability to soft-bankroll the toon with gear, and consumables (as well as knowing what quests to delay for level 50 legendaries with guaranteed good affixes)
---
I hid underwater and found another person in front of me. He didn't see me the whole time. I just swam behind him lol.
---
Bethesda needs to see this, it's absolutely ridiculous. Thanks for your sacrifice.
---
Still a better love story than twilight
---
Tried full screen not borderless/windowed full screen?
---
Also look up how to disable built in Vsync by adding a custom .ini file, yes the game has that in there.
---
Very easy to do, just look up Angry Turtle’s Video on it.
---
I'm  not even going to ask where that gt came from 😂
---
yep !  you are !
---
Full screen fixed it, thanks!
---
I had level 4 explosives.  Took off gunsmith and blasted everything with auto grenade launcher.   Breaks every 5 minutes!!!  Remember to keep white knight ON so you dont break your flashy duds!!
---
Also, it’s just plain fun to say - way worser - try it on a few times, you’ll see
---
It plays every so often without any input from players.
---
Makes me chuckle that it’s ghillied up but has a shiny steel shovel fastened to the side.
---
No problem lol.
---
Twas the only reason I used my shotgun, pulled it out of retirement... just to realize how underpowered it is. Standard Hardened Piercing Combat Shotgun. It felt like I was spitting salt.
---
No, you only had to spend 3x the resources to repair 10 weapons for a measly 250 score, which is ~0.0000025x 150 atoms
---
I wonder what percentage we will see them at.
---
Niiiiiice!!!!! The plan would be awesome!!!
---
If they nerf anything I'd say its less likely to be bloodied and more likely to be how we're able to stack damage mitigation.  The whole point of Bloodied is that you're supposed to be a glass cannon, what breaks it is that you can stack so much damage mitigation from your armor, perks, sentinel effects and PA's emergency protocols that you're less glass and more cannon.
---
Log out and step back.  You're choosing to make the game a grind.  Playing this title to end-game, exploring the world and taking part in events you find fun require almost no grinding.  It's almost trivially easy to make it to lvl 50.
---
If you want a bunch of useless cosmetic items and camp items that have nothing to do with the core gameplay, then by all means grind away.
---
Find a set of ghoul slayer armor and weapons.
---
I waited until I was level 45 or so but yeah this game has certain areas that are just filled with high level enemies.
---
Thanks. Just bought the bundle today, looks like my camp will be a little noisy now, between the vendors and the collectron. And Beckett talking. 
---
Think I may go live in my tent.
---
No. u got me completely wrong.
---
1. I asked if it is safe to sell now (bcz of the last "thing" discovered). Last time they disabled our vending machines bcz of abusing same (kinda same) "thing" with vending machines/option as is.
---
2. I didnt know about the limit of caps. I have never reached the limit bcz I always buy recipies/plans. For now I inverted 700+ hours in the game and that was the damn news for me. Shit happens.
---
3. I asked u why is not possible to sell items from my stash no mater what. As u know we have 3 ways to store stuff: stash, our inventory and scrapbox (for 1st members). And we can sell only from our stash using Vending Machines of course. 
---
4. I have no error messages, no problems with selling. I am just worried bcz it is bethesda and after kick u off and suspend ur account they start some sort of investigations for days or weeks (as they say).
---
5. I have a reason to be worried bcz one time I got my account suspended by mistake (another game) and fo76 is pretty much I do now.
---
6. I got the answers I needed. Thanks man. I have no wish to comment the part where u critique me. But u gotta read before sending a comment. That is the only thing I can tell u. 
---
Ciao.
---
If you're not on PC, you should be - playing an FPS on console is masochistic.
---
Just farm low lvl mobs and repair there pipe guns and boards before you sell or scrap them. Takes very little to repair.
---
It seems like it has to be a bug or something, I've been seeing these guys show up in quest areas since I was level 5. It's always the same guys too, level 62 charred ferals ghouls, sometimes legendary
---
Thanks for the suggestion
---
Maybe there’s a little concept called “patience” and waiting for everything to become clear. I’m not “pushing back” i’m just trying to clarify that it isn’t as hard and predatory as people have made it seem. Sure complaints could’ve forced the double xp and score stuff but also they could’ve been planned before then and i’m sure they were considering that’s common battle-pass practice.
---
This started happening to me last night. Only way i could fix it was too exit all the way out and restart the game. I'm on PC
---
Bad time for this to start happening since i just started leveling a Vats rifleman :/
---
They'll probably make it so it they disappear after ~15 seconds after reading this.
---
They seem very determined in the last few weeks to make the game as unplayable as possible.
---
Edit: Unless you're paying for 1st, in which case expect a cross akin to an Angel dying in Evangelion to appear on every enemy you kill.
---
if you struggle to stay alive swap bandolier for barbarian for extra DR.
---
Does grenadier work? Hmm. I would take 1 point from PER and put it in STR 
---
lone Wanderer in the age of public teams? better off with strange in numbers, squad maneuvers and inspiration.
---
I'd swap out born survivor for 1 gun fu. And do you need to sneak? Enemies can't detect you if they're all dead. Also consider evasive if you need more DR
---
I would remove four leaf clover and go with class freak. The boost to your stats is better than filling your crit meter IMO. You'll be murdering most things with normal shots. With class freak 3 and herd mentality you'll get +3 to all stats when you're in a party by yourself and if someone else is mutated in your team you'll get +4 to all stats.
---
Achievements still work fine.
---
From my understanding, it isn't easy fix. Also this is the first week/weeks of 76 being on game pass so they want to have it running for a good impression for new players, and therefore more money from the Atom Shop, and new Fallout 1st subscribers. This also helps eliminate the GameFlipppp*** activity. Just my theory's.
---
Are you saying you can pre-complete upcoming challenges in the hour before reset? 
---
Trying to nail down exactly what the deal is so I can avoid this issue.
---
Iys not just you. They did add a couple more today.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but aren't limb damage and FFR both major effects so they cant be on the same gun together
---
I hope Tenderizer plans mean that it will drop legendary versions just like with Fixer plans and other new weapons. Finally?
---
Yessssss
---
Then why not communicate that to us and we wouldn't be complaining. That doesn't make any sense.
---
It’s a visual thing. I think it’s actually flamer fuel or one of the others
---
Right now with SCORE and XP/INT it just makes sense too. When shopping around I'm seeing less Unyielding pieces available for even obscure armor types and same goes for what's selling for me. Seems like it's possible some people are just throwing it on mix and match for that bonus INT.
---
Ps4
---
yea I haven’t been on reddit at all today so right after I posted this I saw someone had a post saying they put out more
---
I suspect you find this pretty frustrating, as it will be pretty underpowered.
---
Next time you’re at event with high levels, look for two handed melee.
---
It also gets you closer to level 300 if you're not already there for the legendary perk slots. And it also let's you bank perk points and perk card points.
---
Being done early is not the same as when there is no season running though. Why give us score dailies when there is no season active...
---
Oh yea not ffr reload speed
---
No penalty for dying and Unyielding is optimal for XP gain.
---
Who TF is Mag? lol
---
I doubt it. Ppl are getting suspensions but nothing an alt account cant fix.
---
Fair enough maybe they could’ve communicated it beforehand. I for one don’t understand how they didn’t anticipate people moaning because anything they do gets people crying these days. Anywho the amount of effort and time spent debating this could’ve been directed towards completing your dailies man 🤷🏼‍♂️
---
Technically, it is the same.
---
No reason to award score anymore when it doesn't benefits you in any way.
---
My thought should not replace the previous post, more or should expand it as an addition.
---
I see them most often in player vendors, so keep checking those out. Good luck!
---
I have an not dooped furious mr handy buzzsaw blade it’s op
---
Yeah that was fact before the score, they probably didn't fix this
---
It's okay. I want the fireplace too. Actually I wish I had atoms for the nuka cola secret door back then. I actually bought the slocum vendor. I stare at him when it dances. Funky noises too. Lol that entertains me a bit. Don't feel sad. You are not any less of a person if you don't get that fireplace. Or any of these things. Period. Keep your head up.
---
I have an explosive build and hate them
---
...usually i am wearing shirt and shorts... ;)
---
Because I like to get other people’s opinions
---
The first tjme they literally flatten my camp with meat lures. I think that's what they're called. I'm somewhat new to this so I don't remember the name of everything. Last night when it started to happen again I switched servers.
---
I’d say the All Rise or Grognak Axe
---
Where did you find this information?
---
Some people seem to despise physics breaking camps suspending in the air but I can craft and sleep in peace at mine while the generator, vendor and megasloth make as much noise as they want down below out of hearing range.
---
It's like the ending to rogue 1
---
Probably a 2 hander. Why? They hit harder.
---
I like the pole hook.
---
This i absolutely 100% agree with
---
Nice! Tenderizer plan finally. Any info on RNG percent?
---
I would consider getting addicted to alcohol and equipping the party boy/girl perk at max lvl if you have the points.  Also I use psycobuff instead of psyco, gives a better plus to damage.  I don't do bloodied so I don't know the perks you need.  Also make sure your addictions are spread out across as many perks as possible.
---
Gave it a try and it's a game changer! Really helps map out your perks
---
I think there is more going on here than one thing, or else Bethesda would have caught it a year ago when people started complaining about atom challenges and this issue.
---
My routine is to log into adventure after any nuclear winter shenanigans and not play from 11 to 1215 eastern.  So far I’ve had no issues.
---
I’ve lost score twice now, 1750 total I believe it is
---
One time I was on during reset.
---
The other I logged in after 9 with my character that had been in nw, and had leveled up in adventure mode, via NW.
---
All superstition here, but like many bugs with Bethesda, the community has to work around it.
---
Nope, not a bug. Bethesda just can't get leveling right. There are some areas that just naturally have high level enemies.
---
I'm not at home. You are still missing the point. No one's really complaining that the dailies are hard. It's the amount of them required.
---
Great post. Nice to see it happen. Seems the biggest causation is bring in game during the reload. At least we have a method around it but it needs to be fixed. Thanks for posting
---
And happy cake day.
---
Just my opinion, but if you're over level 100 and stealing Legendaries for level 35 items at Uranium Fever...for shame lol.
---
A friend told me that servers went down at 4:30pm gmt.
---
But id have expected to see a post on this sub by now
---
It’s no bug, some areas are just very challenging when you’re lower level. I barely went to the cranberry bog or the mire until I was level 40 or so
---
Seems like there are more today for sure.
---
Respectfully, it shouldn't be our responsibility to schedule our playtime around bugs.
---
May try that if things get too bad.
---
I hope they can sit on couches on such
---
Nah how about people stop cheating. Gtfo
---
Use a Gatling Plasma with the beam splitter, it’s like a flamer/shotgun. Perfect for close up. 
---
I run the same build, I have a mutant’s bone club with faster swing and reduced weight (so it is only 0.1 lbs which is why I keep it) but I honestly never use it. Between that and my Quad tesla, I never switch to melee
---
It's not a bug as far as I'm aware. The building used to be filled with low level scorched until Bethesda changed that with a recent patch (I think it was the Wastelanders update). I think you can sneak your way to the terminal you need to access without too much enemy contact if you pick the nearest entrance. Don't go in guns blazing.
---
I'm not bitter at all, everyone's time in their life is valuable because your spending it on something. I don't think anyone should be banned for getting a legacy they've wanted since launch. If Bethesda banned you, join the class action lawsuits against them. Duping is an exploit, not cheating, big difference.
---
*You should stop asking "this kind of" question.*
---
can you by the plans for shielded secret service?  Sorry have not looked into this yet
---
They did change that interior to a high level zone. The door now says it’s best for level 30+, which can still be a bit low. 
---
That said, if you’re sneaky—really sneaky—you should be able to get past them. If they’re “Literally” filling the hallways that’s a bug. There’s 20-30 of them inside that whole interior, tops.
---
That happens with me a lot too. Sucked because the last Uranium Fever I was doing, I was the highest level player with some 25-80's players.
---
No one expects the level 81 to be the dick with the explosive Gatling plasma; it HAS be the level 216 with a ghoul slayers fixer.
---
Bottom text as well?
---
Yeah, defo. It's just how it is I guess
---
Likely "magic"
---
https://fed76.info/a/limb-damage-bug/
---
Well known and abused bug that has been around for months. I addition to few other effects.
---
Best for me was the ammo machine. I sell ammo as fast as it makes it. If I had my time back I would of went for the Secret Service armor over the T-65. Vanguard build SS is just as good as the T-65.
---
But if they ain’t hard then why is quantity an issue? I’ve literally explained how i’ve missed a few NW dailies and i’m still already level 31/32 on the season. a 3rd way through on the 2nd (or 3rd?) week... i’ve played a lot less the past week too. there’s statistics then there’s putting them into practice and honestly if you are actually trying to get the rewards instead of throwing empty complaints around you’d see it isn’t that time consuming at all. And since when was level 100 on anything meant to be obtainable for everybody? People are gonna miss out, imagine how special level 100 would feel if everybody had it.
---
That place used to be full of really low levels for everyone, but now when you enter it tells you the level req. It says 30+ level recommendation I believe but I've never seen anything other than 60's in there, making it an excellent XP farm location. 
---
If it's meant to be that way I think the devs massively underestimated how tough those boys are to lower levels, especially at close quarters with a huge mob of them.
---
I dunno how much or little it's supposed to scale, if at all, but still. Do what you can as far as resistances go, maybe the ghoul armour and a good rapid fire gun and go to town on em a bit at a time. There's no real penalty for death so if you wanna do the brute force method...
---
Once you get the route down and learn the interior, and you know the spawns and locations you can juke them a lot easier and keep the numbers down to deal with.
---
Important to be able to control incoming rads, so leadlined armor, rad shield all helpful. 
---
The problem is really moving from 95% irradiated back to 81% irradiated, after a ghoul fight. 
---
I hot key diluted radaway.
---
Getting high rads is just a trip to Black Water mine
---
Black water mine has a radioactive pool outside.
---
When you move your camp while you have structures built, it automatically creates a blueprint which appears in your "stored" tab, and can be placed where you move (if it will let you place it) without paying extra resources
---
If you can't place it, you can scrap the stored blueprint to regain the structures you built and use them to build again
---
If it didn't provide you with that stored blueprint it was probably a bug, but it should work now :)
---
10/10 would read again. 
---
I found my first when i was buy myself and after emptying a few hundred rounds into it it's health had barely moved. I had to cheese it. Didn't think about messaging people. 
---
ALSO! I think it has been stealth buffed as the ones i killed before the last update definitely seemed way easier.
---
Probably not since Bethesda dosnt work on weekends normaly, atleast monday morning woukd be my guess but i can be wrong 😅
---
how do you compete with being able to hit for thousands of damage at a time while simultaneously being nigh unkillable unless you are careless?
---
this will defo get down voted but dont try to bull me saying bloodied is "high risk high reward", the risks of death are down right ignore-able and the reward for it is massive.
---
damn, I just posted on filthy casuals that I thought this was a fix for the 4 auto-completes I got yesterday didn't realize it may be the norm now.
---
Imagine feeling special because you have some pixels someone else doesn't. Imagine spending time creating something for your game only a fraction of the playerbase can attain. These are both stupid.
---
Thanks for the info. I'll try to avoid being on around the update time and see how that works. I never play NW, so that's not contributing in my case.
---
I'm not sure where i stand on bottom text tbh. I would need more information before i commit. Maybe a series of essays.
---
Never thought about lone wanderer when making that do I'll defo swap it out, not sure why born survivor is on so ill make sure to get gun fu, also going to make sure to get class freak, it's usually a perk I ignore so I think its finally worth using it. Thanks so much for all that :)
---
Very slightly I believe
---
what was that bert the turtle song, "duck and cover"?
---
I love 2 handlers and played the first year with that as my main.  I switched to shotgun recently to change it up, but with a strength build an instigating Grognak, with 40% faster speed and I one shot most mobs.  I also have a vampire one which I find when I do that I can do the clubhouse and pull both floors at once and never touch a stim.
---
Mutant's should give 10% per mutation like junkies does per addiction
---
I try my hardest, but sometimes they completely ignore it and the legendsry gets 2 hits on me and its not worth it trying to let them get a hit on it anymore.
---
Same thing with me donating stuff to newbies, I tried dropping a care package to a newer player and they were moving around like I was threatening them.
---
By the time players get a clue they can likely fend for themselves.
---
My bloodied build brothers are rising, we have come to take our place
---
Yep refuse payment for the vaccum tubes, and for the other one you need to kill the former raider and then select 'the wasteland has a new corpse'
---
So which one would you prefer?Je Gatling plasma or jffr gauss minigun apart from the ammo and just considering the damage
---
The whole point of earning anything in a game is the sense of *pride and accomplishent* (that’s a joke) but come on man, literally every other game has the same business model, are you saying the model as a whole is wrong then?
---
Thanks I new I could refuse payment from the settlers and get more rep but I didn't know for the raiders
---
[Definitely the farmable tiles.](https://imgur.com/a/uJU8igN)
---
Can [confirm](https://i.imgur.com/5FqFNN0.jpg)
---
It’s cancerous against anything you shoot at I was told the other day it’s glitched
---
Best: SS Armor Worst: (cant believe no one mentioned this) The Water Well 750 gold bullion of worthless dirty water
---
It certainly had a lot of health! My VATs shotgun blast usually does a good amount of damage on just about any creature, but when I shot it a couple times and saw almost no damage on its health bar, I figured I should get some reinforcements xD
---
Really? I got it off a drop and I’ve only known about it for a few days
---
Well yes and no, you might've finished but there are many who didn't. They can't give dailies per player. It's different when the season is over.
---
Sure but Bethesda might have logged you have so many gifts in your inventory, would make me nervous
---
That's less of a credit to give to the Score system and more to Beth for just pulling their head slightly out of their ass since the game launched with a simple daily level up once challenge for 10 Atoms before they decided to make the recurring challenges way more difficult and annoying like the Level Up While one.
---
But yeah, being able to not worry about having to change my outfit is a breath of fresh air.
---
There was a group of players I played with and there was a dude who was over level 800, and I asked him how many hours he put on. He said he was embarrassed to tell me and didn't. He got banned a couple of days ago, and vented and let it out that he had spent over 6000 hours on that game. I didn't know what to say, that seems wrong. That's 200 something days of your life you'll never get back. I love 76 and I play a lot but I just broke the 1200 hour mark and I've played since launch.
---
then there's the "Presidential Gauss Rifle" that i keep running into on the wiki....
---
... (violently shakes MODUS terminal)
---
Wait, did someone legit got to rank 100? I highly doubt it. 
---
  Once again, bethesda doesn't care about cheaters. Grinding is not worth it
---
The thing about fo4 is it’s more a FPS than an rpg imo. Fallout 3 and especially New Vegas have much better narratives and role playing.
---
With the unyielding it adds 15 to strength with full set my character has 1 strength but with full set its 16
---
Now this is a collectron I’m ready to pay for
---
why are you showing us a picture of the grass? i get the water is pretty but a grass picture doesn't really show your suit off
---
yeah, THIS. had true LUCK that an old nuke zone yielded a dozen damaged items other players had not looted...
---
Hahaha I guess all we both needed was that last 100 XP. Anyway I’m really glad we got it before they fix it! Merry Christmas in July lol.
---
I'm 344
---
Yeah when I'm on events not alone, I always pop a "come here" gesture when I see a legendary.
---
Also I always use an explosive shotgun that does like 9 damage so everyone can get their EXP share.
---
Sometimes the other guys on the event don't do this but when they see me doing it, it starts to spread. Remember to be nice even when no one else is.
---
My favorite is All Rise and Super Sledge and I carry Grognak which looks cooler ..  you want cards like bloody mess and good strength cards like slugger
---
That last one I didn't know gave more rep. Will try it next time cheers.
---
Would be a good ATX item for meat week
---
It gets nuked because of the event that pops up there, and you can get high rad fluids, hardend mass, glowing mass from all the burned victims there.
---
(tries to kill boomer protectron)
---
"No more inert bomb crap you jerk!"
---
No, they did not remove every duplicate weapon, they just removed some from accounts that had multiples of the same on one toon. That's quite a different thing than removing all the dupes.
---
Anyways, just read my previous post, you'll see the problem why this can't be automated in the way you think.
---
The cheftron would be awesome for meat week!
---
Thing is a lot id those ppl wind up spending a similar amount of money in micro transactions. 
---
But the real strength of the whole premium store model from a business perspective is its great at allowing a few whales to spend thousands of dollars on a game. 
---
People will literally buy every last cosmetic item with almost 100% real world money.  Those few individuals push ther revenue up substantially.
---
obviously your friend is a synth
---
Ah forgot about the prefs. In the prefs you have :
---
bFull Screen=1
---
bBorderless=1
---
Try to change them to 0. When i do that with my gaming monitor connected the game starts at my default screen on my laptop.
---
You mean a schlachtfest for all those WMDs that got duped?
---
Thanks, but no thanks.
---
Unless it's a bug.
---
I don't know which game you're playing but it's not Fallout 76.
---
Most people are nice and considerate on events.
---
I feel stupid that I found one and just ate it.
---
at ohio river adventures, you can also talk to Fishbones and get another small rep boost by defending their purifiers (for rep, talk to him after the mirelurks stop, and exp is given)
---
Such a great weapon, but a pain to make ammo for... still, a BE lmg is a great weapon. Not the most desireable 3rd roll, not the worst either. You got a decent piece there.
---
I have a lot of AA/Junkies/Vampire explosives I would love to trade for but I won’t be on my pc for two weeks
---
Ahahaha, I'd love to see that
---
Can you be more specific than just “broke”?
---
It absolutely is functional to large degree and this is vague to the point of misleading.
---
Try using a low level weapon which is completely different from your build. I'm a stealth rifle user and my short barreled explosive shotgun does like 9 damage from afar, and it tags everything.
---
Also, molotovs.
---
I can agree and and can confirm this. After update 20, more endurance gives more health.
---
Rank 53
---
Do you have unyielding armor, brain fungus soup recipe, and cranberry relish all along with the herbivore mutation? If you do you can really increase the intelligence stat and expierence gains.
---
People already maxed out on ranks. Exploits never fail to deliver
---
That's quite a gem. About as good as it gets for a heavy. Don't trade it for just anything, and certainly don't waste it on the stuff being duped.
---
Nope, servers didn't go down.
---
So many upvotes but when I suggested that they had to up the penalty I got downvoted.
---
Yeah i suspected not.
---
Was at work so couldn't confirm
---
You are not wrong, perhaps they meant faster reload?
---
If you’re on Xbox I have about 150 total spices salt and pepper, you can have it all I grab them impulsively whenever I find them but I never need them cause I have herbivore
---
Lvl 83 and just saw it nuked for the first time last night, everyone else seems to nuke the lower right hand corner to do the quest with the queen or to try and get the windego colossus to spawn (which is fun as hell to fight)
---
Nope not at all
---
He just said that
---
Yeah the cheated part comes from the fact I went to work on 2 hrs of sleep to finish my "limited time" event
---
It’s pretty charming but the pacing needs some tweaks.
---
I had that problem the other night, had to exit the game and relaunch.
---
Switch server pal
---
Yeah, I have a L35 Junkie's faster fire rate minigun that melts the queen also while showing 1s and 2s for damage.
---
Would have to make it so no build gets an advantage because bloodied would murder everything. Maybe have preset loadouts you can pick. Kinda like Monster Hunter World.
---
If you're on PC, get the mod for it.
---
I have a heavy weapons build so I'm thinking of getting like a low level 10mm pistol or something because shotguns seem to still kill things easily even though I dont have any of the perks
---
The bloodied is still better, but the handmade is a solid roll.
---
man those charred still fuck me up
---
I partially do it because I love all the extra carry weight from unyielding lol (and I'm a stealth character so having low up ain't the worst)
---
Chefbot
---
Makes sense. Switch all stimpaks and radaway to diluted, right?
---
Not every battlepass is meant to be hard to accomplish to entice you to spend money. RDR2s online battle pass is very easy to complete and I'm sure there are more examples. It doesn't have to be a cash grab they can be fun instead.
---
Players will run out of caps before this is patched 😂
---
Thanks. I'm hanging on for a really good alternative for a non blood heavy build
---
How do you even hold hands??
---
Holy crap thanks it worked instantly ive been waiting to play for a while now thanks!
---
Name in the game?
---
Yes but you can always farm pipe pistol from low level (1-5) scorched quite easy and doesnt need much resource.
---
My problem is with the nuclear winter ones.
---
How much score do you think is possible per hour using this method?
---
Try logging out and back in see if it’ll let you redo it
---
Vampires Grognak would be insane! I’ve never used one actually. I also moved my main but to heavy guns to be more involved in queen fights and stuff.
---
I prefer AA to Furious, but the Furious will out DPS the AA on stronger targets. It is kind of subjective.
---
No armor or mutation. But yes to recipes.
---
It’s only the ones that shoot bullets melt me man
---
Their constant party line since announcing the game has been that its experimental and they’re going to adjust things. I doubt they planned to change the amount of SCORE based challenges but planned to be open if they saw that say the top quartile of active players weren’t going to be able to complete it (or whatever internal metric they had decided since I have no idea what they expected). That makes more sense than either “it was always planned” or “our torches and pitchforks convinced them”.
---
Even if you wear all unyielding SS armor you're still losing 40 pounds of carry weight from not having deep pocketed mods for the limbs. Giving up that much is tough.
---
Don’t forget, it also means that you can pass almost any speech check, guaranteed.
---
It's not a chore for me! What worked for me was when I uninstalled the game back when the legendary run launched - mainly because I realized I'm not that interested in grinding dailies. I totally understand people who feel a massive sense of FOMO and want a whole bunch of rewards they can't seem to play long enough to get. I wish there was a solid way I could help you guys feel more free instantly.
---
I guess if there's one thing I can say that could get you on the right track, it's to gradually build a healthy sense of disrespect for this game (or any game you suffer with FOMO from). I still love it, but I'm not afraid to walk away from it for long stretches of time. I work out a lot so I can focus on that pretty easily instead of playing this game... so find other more productive and fun ways to occupy your time. That said, I have no problem coming back when big content updates pop up - it makes comebacks all the sweeter, plus I feel zero burnout.
---
Anyway yeah I hope this helps someone.
---
Best Jetpack
---
Because the added mobility is great?
---
Thank you for your sacrifice, your score will be avenged!
---
They probly will come one meat week or another it makes since with the current theme of them.
---
Shhhh... don’t say anything please.
---
Well if you can try to find the mutation from a player vendor and the armor can seriously help you out, it doesn't matter what level it's the stat increase you want.
---
Then how is that an indicator
---
I prefer it to PA, but PA has a bunch of hidden Damage and Rad Reduction.
---
SSS 4 life
---
He reaches the end on the last day of the season.
---
Yes...this. Especially if it says stuff like Bam! and Kick it up a Notch!
---
There is a good amount in the silos.
---
I have to agree with ya. However, I only play 76 to do the Season Pass thing &amp; try to finish some, if not all, daily challenges. By the time I'm done, I just leave it &amp; hop on another game or go to Netflix.
---
Mm I don't care that much
---
Herbivore is better than carnivore imo for xp. 25% bonus xp from cranberry relish and +5 intelligence from brain fungus stew with herivore and strange in numbers can't be best and you aren't bound to an event for canned meat stew.
---
I definitely believe that more than our complaining convinced them and less than it was always planned. The issue with that is they should be getting our feedback in regards to criticism (NOT JUST COMPLAINTS) and giving feedback as well as to why they made their choices. 
---
Like, why make us play NW? Which is honestly one of the biggest criticisms aside from the obvious everyone being scared of the grind/not being able to finish.
---
If ur on console, on pc ppl duped them somehow or spawned idk
---
For my build raider is probably better but for the life of me I can't get the last 2 plans to drop so I use ss instead
---
We play with a pretty good group most nights and are always up for a Queen fight. Feel free to add me Freestateepp
---
You essentially eliminate the sponge problem entirely and you gain enough boosts from stuff like serendipity and Nerd Rage (as well as Unyielding itself) to make you as durable as a normal person anyway. Saving a ton of ammo usage also means less scrounging for mats.
---
Having the Jeep that the .50 cal is periodically found in as a  placeable barricade would be cool, similar to the trailer from the free states bundle.
---
Thanks Also How Do i get back in The Vault though
---
I don't know if the station was pre war. It's a pretty short range transmission and he runs it out of his little room. I'm sure he found a holotape of the play and just broadcasts it.
---
The backpack too probably, it’s listed as Challys Backpack.
---
The power armor glitch?
---
36 here and been asking myself the same thing.
---
Just saw this today.  3 popped but I didn’t see them or the bodies.
---
I dont want the mutation. I eat both meat and vegetable foods. Cutting them in half would be stupid as i would lose out on multiple benefits thst I easily obtain from them. Even if i where to pick the meat or vegetable side the double benefits still wouldn't add up to what I get but it would be close and require less work than what I currently do.
---
They responded to my ticket saying they will not be doing anything. They don’t care. They built in the pay to win mechanics so players would have to use it. This all works in their benefits so I don’t see any reason they’d jump to fix it or make it up to players. Why would they when we can spend a $1.50 in atoms to correct their Bugged event. Also remember that this isn’t a new bug, it’s been around long before the legendary run and they didn’t fix it then, so now will be no different. Back then it saved them giving us free atoms and now it saves them from giving us free loot. They can only gain from this bug unlike all the rest.
---
No matter your build, the dodgy and ricochet perks will help mitigate a considerable amount of incoming damage from gutsies, assaultrons and any other enemy with heavy ranged attacks. 
---
High DR is only half of a solid defense.  You really need percentage based mitigation effects to be able to absorb damage from high level enemies.
---
That isn't a good thing about the \*score system\*, it just means the new challenges suck less than the old ones.  They could've revamped challenges without making it a come-back-daily slog
---
If you haven’t played NW before, you probably got credit for completing the first Halloween, Christmas, and survival challenges for those bugged rewards
---
Hits and crits have a chance to not connect regardless of what it tells you the % is at, especiallyif you dont wait a sec after engaging vats. And for some weapons, the game bugs out and rubberbands the health back. Also some times you can shoot through walls with vats, or sometimes it will disengage for no reason despite having line of sight and a healthy amount of AP left.
---
I’m on Xbox and my big issue yesterday was the frame rate dropping to like 1 per second, I felt like I had vertigo trying walk around and I wasn’t even in an event or fighting
---
Well i kno when the plan for the Tenderizer comes durin meat week im gonna be hunting for a B/SS/+1S one. Its just such a cool weapon design.
---
Holy shit same, I rolled an Unyielding, Sprint DR &amp; +E chest armor on the second try, and have since rolled about 90 modules for the arms and legs with barely anything good.
---
I'd rather have my 50% extra duration on chems tbh
---
I love it when it happens. It makes me feel like I'm running around in a western.
---
There were 3 at the main entrance, but once I killed them and got to the main hallway I got swarmed by at least 20
---
I guess I gotta have a whole armor and weapons set specifically to deal with them lmao
---
He used to be level 60+ until Beth decided to nerf him. Still a bit annoyed about that.
---
A tenderizer plan? Are you sure?
---
I'd take the fixer. Beter base damage and more common ammo. Also looks better ;)
---
He did it. He stopped duping, you guys!
---
Thanks for the response, I tried the brute force method and they started to respawn behind me after I killed about 10 of them haha
---
If you don’t go ape sh!t on me I’ll wave and continue my study of the wasteland shrubbery in peace, while the world burns around us.
---
Quest markers are buggy as shit a lot of the time unfortunately.  Start looking around the woods just north of the airport for a tent with a robot next to it.
---
Can you do the scorch beast queen fight? It rewards repair kits so you never have to use materials to repair armor or weapons again
---
Yeah
---
wth how can you hold hands? i dont see this emote? thats pretty cool
---
The same place u entered. That cave with the keypad. Not the vault 79 logo, thats where u go after the quest is done.
---
Yeah I’m gonna need more info on that... kinda controversial...
---
Sometimes specific servers will have a shutdown timer. Doesn’t mean that all of 76 is getting server maintenance, just that that specific one needs to go down for whatever reasons.
---
I don't get this community. The other day people, including me, were being downvoted for pointing out that the mod even exists
---
You’re missing my point. They start from an assumption that some percentage of players based on time in game per week will hit 100 and that another percentage could hit it with some outlay of Atoms.
---
Then they figure out that based on reality... their numbers are off.  They may also decide to increase that target percentage based on feedback.  If it seems a large number of players are unhappy that their play style has no chance of hitting the goal, for instance. The reason they never respond to the feedback is that it’s only part of the decision making process. 
---
They may try to use SCORE to encourage the large population which has never tried NW to give it a shot, if they’re on the bubble of reaching rank 100 without spending Atoms. NW needs people trying it out to stay viable. And the folks that enjoy it deserve to have their gameplay style preserved too.
---
The legendary Tenderizer meta is upon us 💃💃💃💃
---
What platform do you run?
---
They don't want to hear it, you're wasting your time sadly.
---
It's funny that they say "stating the obvious" when it's not a thing at all and never was in any game that isn't a heavily story driven single player game.
---
A someone said i can't remember who nor where, exclusivity drives desire, desire incentivize investment and investment is what is needed to merit rewards.
---
&gt;. Not everybody is meant to unlock everything.
---
This is the core part right there as to why some of us play the way we do. I know i will be downvoted as i go against the narrative and they only want echoed opinions, but showing off is a big part of online games. Having stuff few will have, if any, is enough of an incentive for some players to go after said stuff.
---
Paticipation trophies and all that jazz is what makes people feel like they deserve to earn the same thing as the next guy with a third of the effort. Thats not how it works ig ind irl though.
---
Some people don't like grinding some do, you (general you) don't have to partake in it, but you also don't have the  right to want it gone for those who enjoy it.
---
Fuck that, gave up halfway. Might try to finish when BotW2 gets a release date, but eff those lil turds.
---
We need more lore based material in this game and less of this grind and earn type stuff. I’m still stuck on tier or level 1 or whatever. I can’t care anymore if this is all this game is turning into.
---
Will There Be enemys in there?
---
I am having the exact same issue. And my scrap box has spoiled the bejesus out of me! Running around with weight, storage and inventory issues because of scrap, when I *do* have a 1st subscription that by all evidence, should be active and working just fine, is incredibly frustrating. Thankfully, my wife plays with me and I can pester her to drop a survival tent and take all my scrap and we can still play on her private world. 
---
Hopefully this issue resolved soon. I’ve been mysteriously missing 1st for going on 2 days now. If it were a renewal lag, I’d think 2 days would be enough time for my bank, steam, and Bethesda, to all coordinate and figure it out. 
---
Best of luck with your issue and happy travels through the wasteland!!
---
Send a ticket to support. The more that do they will have to fix it. So far all responses I’ve gotten are that they will do nothing.
---
I often emote and hang out. I know what one is doing if they are swimming or bushing it. Ill even pass them when I'm in full gear and on a team. Let them live!
---
Cool, tenderizer looks awesome
---
You must be a hippy. Commie. Or a saboteur.
---
I’m in Arizona so our time zone shouldn’t be too different, we could use my private server if I can figure out how to add people to my games or go to my online friends server(this is my first online multiplayer game)
---
lofiMOONCHILD
---
1-3 star. Legendary Camps
---
Better love story than Twilight
---
They just send an auto response that they won’t be correcting it.
---
One might say it gives the most rep of all.
---
Had a great experience yesterday. I (level 192) went to do uranium fever after initially thinking to myself that it’s not worth going because of how often people just drop legendaries without waiting. Show up, and two other high levels (240 and 290) are there.
---
Right when the first legendary showed up I saw a ‘follow me’ emote, sure enough the dude allowed me and the other player to come over and get our hits. Went flawlessly on the second one as well. 
---
Then the experience became less great. 
---
Just before the third one, a group of three players ranging from Level 50 to 90 showed up. One or two of them killed the last mole miner (and only three star legendary to spawn) before the rest of us even knew where it was. Shit heads. 
---
I’m not sure what the deal is, but it seems like some people feel the need to look ‘badass’ to strangers that wouldn’t even let them know if they did think that.
---
Of every bad idea I’ve ever heard for this game, this comment is high up on that list.
---
I have a base near SBQ fight, little honey and royal jelly taffy, and i can fly to the Crater with this thing xD its tricky, and waaay longer than fast travel, but its awesome.
---
The NW weekly will count any challenge that you complete in that mode regardless of if it's a daily.
---
Yeah it worked when I loaded in but when I fast traveled it stopped
---
Haven't had this issue and I have been signed on between them times
---
Do you think they'll make legendary versions this time?
---
Its odd because i'm allowed to shoot people in the face while trying to hide, the go back to hiding. Seems like i'm that bad sport who doesn't like getting found. ;_;
---
Honestly, what's the point? When you get a weapon, you are going to mod it. It cancels out any usefulness it had.
---
Throw that garbage in the scrip machine! :p
---
"**Do** you think **love can bloom**, even on a **battlefield**?"
---
Every day this has been happening to me. Bethesda doesn’t seem to care when I send in tickets. They just say they won’t be correcting errors. The gold star is always finished for me, even though required challenges are still active. They just want us to buy the tiles we lost from them.
---
Make sure when you leave you leave from adventure, and when you join go straight to adventure. That was my problem.
---
Oh i know.
---
Thats why i didnt immediately come to reddit to make a useless post that had been asked 20 times already
---
You sir, are a gentleman and a saint! *tips hat
---
Yup, it’s so damn simple and yet many players can’t be bothered. One shot things when it’s just you on your own, don’t screw up legendary drops for other people.
---
This worked thank you.
---
Find a pump shotgun with +33% vats accuracy.
---
Use vats of course, and you will have your new main. 
---
Vampire effect on mine is also, VERY nice. 😉
---
I’m on Xbox, any event that has legendaries, I take a few shots, wave over everyone to follow and just tank it. I’ve been in the shoes of watchin them get slaughter prior to me even seeing them. 
---
It’s a thing  we can all benefit from!
---
Intelligence boosting buffs. Food Chems etc. 
---
Armor +1 intelligence and unyielding depending on build. 
---
Mutation herd mentality +3 grouped
---
Building team on public server. Max bond team +4 intelligence
---
Perk Inspirational in CHR for +15% gains.
---
Well rested +5%
---
Cranberry relish +10%
---
EST, for me at least the daily challenges refresh at noon.  I haven't been logged in during that time, but after seeing threads about the challenges auto completing I decided to be sure I'm not to avoid losing any SCORE.
---
Bethesda bad Obsidian good upvotes on the left 
---
I’ve had this happen one time. I forgot I had my bloody weapon out and took a quick shot at a leg and the terminated employee immediately gives up on life. I tried profusely apologizing on area, but I’m not sure I was heard. I wish there was a sorry emoticon. 
---
(Also, on a side note: a laughter emoticon).
---
Exit vats and go back in. It does happen to me at times when I am moving around alot. If I notice I miss twice, I exit, go back in and it works again
---
They added more based on feedback, but that doesn't mean that a full chimpout was required to provide that feedback. Within 24 hours of the season update, we already had people saying the grind was impossible, you would either have to do every challenge every day or pay for tiers, etc. I specifically remember some front page posts saying people would be happy if this was the last season or that they should just scrap it and give people rewards. I called them clowns back then and I'll stick to it now. This is the first season, and they specifically said they would be avoiding focusing on things like adding old atom shop items in there so that they can focus on adjusting this as necessary. With all of that as public information, assuming that there wouldn't be any changes throughout the season was just stupid, yet that's exactly what all those posts did.
---
To rephrase it a different way: there are constructive ways of giving feedback, and then there's throwing a tantrum like my two year old nephew. Only one of those has a place here
---
That would be nice QoL
---
What about Bethesda re releasing Skyrim for 100th time on everything...
---
They glow when they spawn but lose the visual effect after a few seconds.  I saw it on all 3 at Uranium Fever the other night
---
Yeah, I wish we had voice chat so I could convince them to just punch me while I spam stimpaks (or whatever the challenge of the day is).
---
Yours spits salt? Mine spits glorified confetti.
---
Being a heavy build and AP being trash already I don't use shotguns often anyways, not sure I'll be able to find one but I'll take the tip to keep my eye out for one.
---
You need to buy legendary modules and vault steel. It shares a mod pool with ultracite armour. You will need 180 vault steel and 6 legendary modules to build a complete set.
---
I mean, GTA V has literally made more money overall than other piece of entertainment currently (games, movies, etc.)
---
Cranberry relish is easier. Stranger friends too and herb and you will have 25% xp + the intelligence from the brain soup.
---
I’ve had so many people give me so many different reasons. Last night I did a full reinstall and let the game sit when I loaded to the main screen and when I loaded in to the world. It’s been super slow and buggy so I figured maybe checking to map to soon was screwing it up. And today it the first day they are all ok. So maybe that’s the cause? The servers have been very slow for me the last four day. Creatures spawning in a full minute after I’ve arrived at the location.
---
Wtf what do u play on
---
True
---
Damn ok. Thanks for letting me know. Hopefully I can find ultracite calibrated shocks lmao
---
It should work the same as the fixer, bear arms, ect, in that once u hav the plan itll show up in legendary pool
---
Lmao, bethesda Wish they would even come close to the quality of rockstar quality. 
---
GTA5 is like 7 years old and recieves more and better content update in 1 year than what Bugthesda released since launch.
---
Bethesda should be ashamed of themselfs
---
You whiteknight losers are the saddest shit to exist, downvote me more to prove me how much im right.
---
You can buy the 2nd. The 3rd one is the only one that you get from savage divide events as far as I know. And shielded wont drop until you know both of the first 2.
---
I always find it fun to see if I can get people to just punch it to death, fists in PA are just viable enough to meet the damage threshold on most all enemies to get a legendary and I've had a few people in the past help me beat the crap out of a legendary megasloth or mirelurk or ghoul
---
Most people on this subreddit down vote use of trigger words, example being “the”.
---
I am on PC. I’m at the in-laws until tomorrow but I’m confident I have them.
---
Out of curiosity, why is your so high? What kind of perks are you using?
---
Formula P you meant?
---
The one from Project Paradise right?
---
Yep. You get them as well as the under armor plans from regs. And you can buy shielded without learning the first two first.
---
I have plenty of extra repair kits from SBQ fight.  I just used them on any weapon (including weapons at full cond) and it counts toward the goal.
---
Pretty sure you’ll find a dead dude in a basement there that has a key card (in his hand) that will get you upstairs. They changed the mission etc. there a little while back and not enough people care to get it updated I guess. Hope this helps, sorry if you’re issue is different.
---
I have been playing games like State of Decay 2, and No Man’s Sky lately and it’s really opened my eyes as to how much time I’m wasting with these live service titles. 
---
Part of me enjoys grinding but with the two previously mentioned games, I can play those for a while and when I start to get tired of them I can take a break. When I do come back to them not only do I not have to worry  about having missed a ton of content, the game is actually better, having been given a bunch of improvements.
---
It’s even more popular with the XP boost high intelligence gives.  I’m not a fan as I like being up the SBQ’s sphincter during Scorched Earth, tenderizing it with my .50 Cal
---
No. I have formula p. Formula q is hard to get but you have to go to the basement and get the shutdown code and bring it back to the terminal that starts project paradise
---
I use a bloodied explosive Gatling gun. I think I want to be buried with it.
---
I've been logged in while they reset.. literally watched them disappear one by one and get repopluated by the new ones.
---
None have auto completed for me so far.. so i really don't know what triggers this but it's very weird.
---
I was in the middle of talking to them when a group of high level Anglers came through. They didn't stand a chance with their pipe pistols . . .  RIP
---
What is the tenderizer plan? Weapon?
---
Are we taking into account repairing the legacy weapon every 20 seconds ?
---
That one could easily come back as a weekly as you can do it anywhere. Beth only promised to get rid of the really annoying ones that are very specific like Level Up While, Kill a Legendary at a Fissure Site, Kill a Megasloth in the Cranberry Bog, and etc.
---
Unless they've significantly modified it from fo4, that's simply not possible in this engine. Attachments can only add or subtract a certain amount of a trait, which is why quad/double are unaffected by drum mags and why weightless is a static reduction. They would have to create a new effect in the game that does the same thing as weapon/weight reduction armor but only applies to a specific item, and again I don't think that's possible in the engine because it would require some kind of a unique identifier for it
---
FOMO stress factory is the perfect description. Don’t get me wrong, I am still playing it, but it’s super true. 
---
I’ve found that getting other people to play and helping them along brings a lot of fun back to the game. I definitely take a lot of the head knowledge I have regarding this game for granted and it’s fun being able to help others. 
---
I got one of my buddies (big fallout fan for a long time but was skeptical after 76’s launch and subsequent trashing) to snag the game a few weeks ago and he’s digging it. Now that it’s on gamepass, his brother and another buddy of ours started playing this week. 
---
I actually started a new character to level up alongside them and it’s been a blast. 
---
Also, having a new character helps with the leveling up challenges, that was killer for me at first.
---
Don't feel dragged into strees
---
Yes! This! I know that I can move a point or pick a perk! I KNOW!! I just want to put on Ammocrafting and Super Duper!
---
Hmm, often I am the only one running bloodied when I join a group. At most one other.
---
If you complete Importance of Communication normally, you get 200 Raider Reputation. If you decline the reward, you get +25 Raider Reputation. 
---
[Here is a reference guide. ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wastelanders_reputations)
---
Do you have a link to an album of the images?
---
You are not only math deficient, you are obtuse.  ALL PLAYERS may allocate 56 points worth of perks once they have them all unlocked.  I don't give a rats ass if 6 of them are already unlocked at level 1, you may still ALLOCATE PERKS to them.  They are not RESERVED or LOCKED OUT in any way.  
---
I will post an image that might clear this up for you (I doubt it).  I'm done discussing this.
---
[https://imgur.com/iLW4OJ0](https://imgur.com/iLW4OJ0)
---
Why are they needed to be repaired every 20 seconds?
---
Sending this picture to my wife, who laughed like crazy when I explained to her how I played the NW mode as a bush wookie / lake diver.
---
yeah. if any guide is from more than 2 months ago it probably changed. If you find a door that needs a keycard take the stairs opposite the door. 
---
if you cannot figure it out i can come show you. Also make sire you loot the box in the room at the top as it has the backpack plan
---
I'd love to catch one
---
It’s the best heavy weapon in your opinion?
---
Got a real Seinfeld fan in the house.
---
Np glad that I could help😁 its super annoying that the game can't figure out by it self. I had the same problem a month ago. I just deleted the fallout76 and the fallout76prefs the game started.
---
Yea for once I saw everyone cooperating on unranuim fever and no one killed it until everyone saw everyone hit it
---
They did change the layout. Did you get the card key off the body and get upstairs? That’s the usual bit to get stuck on but otherwise what point you at.
---
Could be the new players. Anyone with XBox game pass can now download on pc and join pc servers
---
No (unfortunately) but I feel there’s an opportunity there like, ‘Harder to be detected whilst in forest areas’ as many other outfits could also have different perks to them
---
Creative engine is super old. I’m amazed they managed to integrate online play. And as for GTA.. it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. I played the story and never looked back. Been playing 76 since launch and love it. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Go kill hookers on gta if that’s your thing.
---
Thank you very much. Maybe I'm gonna keep both in the end.
---
RPGs are grinds. Deal with it.
---
While there is a plan it is not in any rewards list. The Tenderizer itself is a potential reward from the Meat Week event but does not drop as a legendary.
---
However, it does have legendary attach points so some have been spawned on PC.
---
What kinda bs is this having to be logged on to play? It already verified with the xbox app account and allowed passage through the firewall and I get error during login \[3:0:1407374883553287\], is this bc it's not installed to OS drive?
---
Have them launch the world as Team Only and not All Friends. You’ll still be able to join from Social and shouldn’t get kicked
---
One of the main reasons I keep an auto vamp 10mm on me. 
---
(Others include not dying if stealth fails, recon scope for distant thunder/that one nanny random encounter, and saving ammo when rolling through lowbie zones. Sidearms just make sense.)
---
Also if you have an explosive secondary you can just shoot near the targets feet for your tag. It's pretty easy to not be a dick at events.
---
&gt;When Line of sand event comes, get ontop of the mountain behind the  scorched spawns and they should all spawn in one place, don't know why  this happens but i've completed the repeatable over 10 times during one  event 
---
The game is designed to spawn enemies in blind spots so ideally they aren't just appearing out of thin air in front of people.  For Line in the Sand the assumption is that players will be camped around the sonic generator so all of the predetermined blind spot spawns are on the opposite side of the asylums fence.  Have someone stand in that spot on the cliffside and all of the blind spot spawns are now considered no good so the game freaks out and just dumps every single enemy at the center of the event.
---
Similar things can happen in Radiation Rumble if you have people camped in all of the tunnels the ghouls are supposed to spawn in they'll instead start spilling out of the decon arch room next to all the npcs.
---
In the build menu, is this plushie on the same line as the other plushies? Like, can you scroll right or left to get to it or is it on a different space and you have to hit up or down to build it? (Hope that makes sense)
---
Where can I best find megasloth
---
Don't be a greedy developer and create a New engine if your current one isnt working. Bethesda beeing stingy is why this game is a buggy mess.
---
I dislike explosive weapons. FFR are much better imo.
---
Been a sub for a few month. Tends to be around a 48hr delay.
---
Okay thank you for the info
---
You are correct. Sorry.
---
You know what they say, happy wife, happy life :D
---
 Floor decor and it was just near the bottom. It was 1 of 3 options for me, not sure what the other two were, but this one was the first option l already showing up.
---
That's the one.
---
Wonderful. Time to gather 11000 caps lol
---
Correct on both counts. Except cram, it won't work with herbivore.
---
The photomode one I normally do the first grid properly
---
How dare you make a completely valid counterpoint?
---
If you're on PS4 I'll build you one.
---
Can take a day or two to process
---
Very awesome indeed. Thank you so much for putting in the time to do this.
---
I know it says caps but its also effective for screws https://youtu.be/5gUbyvRyqTs
---
Dude I tried to help you. I’m sorry you can’t understand that. I have failed you. Good luck out there.
---
If they do that they should also make the 2-shot projectiles match.
---
beth3: And double check every hour on the hour if the atomic shop is running fine
---
I have a camp right beside the wayward. Sometimes I crouch in chameleon with my quad ffr Tesla. Let the level 2 look around my camp for a bit and then unload a full mag on them. One guy go so scared he ran all the way to flatwoods. Then I usually send them a message and drop some stimpaks and ammo.
---
Yeah, but its bugthesda. It just works.
---
I have done the queen so many times now and not once had it drop. Nor emergency protocols. F\*\*\* rng honestly. Absolutely hate it. 
---
I gave up building Strangler cus of it, Il just do t65 instead.
---
Most aren't effected but some are. Like cram. It's 0 food for me with herbivore. Also no you cannot have both at the same time.
---
Exactly. You’re really moving your health in a very narrow range.
---
I find Healing Factor to be helpful. Usually my health goes up as soon as I reduce my rads
---
The legacy Gatling Plasmas are beasts, but if you exclude legacy and magic, the Gauss minigun and LMG are neck in neck.  The Gauss has a long spin up time, but probably outdamages the LMG.  Think I still prefer the LMG for the insta fire and lighter ammo.  Personally, I am not a big fan of the lasers.  But thats just me.  I'm sure others have totally different opinions.
---
FYI, weapons actually laying around the map, and not in a container, are not affected by Luck and so will have room for repair.
---
And if you need any plans, let me know😂😂😂
---
So the explosive Gatling laser or plasma is better than the gauss minigun?
---
I’m on Xbox mate :(
---
You deserve an upvote pal
---
The last gta update was in December
---
Dont care
---
I can never find these squirells it's fine though i usually just eat canned stew and sb brain.
---
I always forget to sleep for kindered so 9.5/10 times i play without that 5% buff
---
Every time it has happened. I have been at work with my laptop turn off. I havent been on in anyway every time I’ve been effected.
---
Dang. Maybe another kind soul will swing by. Good luck!
---
What is your username in game?
---
Bloodied shotgunner here. I had to adjust to the playstyle but aside from that it's a fuckn beast.  I use bloodied double barrel and combat 1 and 2 star legendary weapons. And full unyielding all mixed pieces. And lord let me tell you it rips shit apart. Most fun I've had so far. Walking  around feeling like a gawd and I love it.. van5 wait until I'm fully decked I cant imagine what its like! I'm super close to gause shotty too.  Gonna be a big game changer for me I've been saving up the junk to craft as many as I can when I unlock it.. I still  need to find out what's chems I should be using for the build... so far I e been on a steady diet of psycho buff lol
---
Do you mean Guided Meditation?  Path of Enlightenment does provide the bonus from  the wise mothman but you're not going to get much exp off the event itself.
---
And yet it held more content than what fallout offered so far, fo76 is a money grabbing mess.
---
DalpandoTehDuck it should be
---
I got the whole set plus the mods only to find out that t 65 has no headlight mods...
---
I kno currently its not, but wasnt it datamined to added to the new meat weak coming, along with a chally costume, cow grill, and meat week beer stein.
---
My GT is the same as my username. I'm a level 205, not a bloodied build. Need any help, let me know. I can lend a hand.
---
You got like snap or something communication works better for me on there
---
Buy them at Foundation from Samuel. You need neighborly reputation.
---
If you two the perk for vendors and some charm nectars you can easy save some caps, I paid 9k for it only with the perk
---
I have to agree, maybe it has to do with more people logging on because of the new score system or something? I've encountered some bugs I never really thought was annoying enough for them to become so now. For example I never really understood why people were complaining so much about the fast travel bug; for me it only happened ever 1/20 travels and just trying again fixed it. This last week I keep having it happen pretty much every time I try to travel.
---
Thanks man
---
Either faction has them as a reward as you gain a certain level.  There are also a couple Atom items that give a coal car one any another one.  But the floors you buy with gold bullion once you get to a level.
---
Cheftron: THIS DEATHCLAW WELLINGTON IS F#CKING RAW!!!
---
They can be a grind, but that grind needs to be worth it in the end. Needs to be rewarding. This grind is just fucking moronic.
---
The shit Bethesda has released clearly reaffirms they haven't the first clue how to do an online game.
---
I love my buggy mess in a World that tries to be perfect in any way and does no mistakes and everything is so shiny and wants you to believe everything is good. I fucking love my buggy mess wouldnt trade for 200k caps
---
Brain fungus soup for herbivore is +INT
---
Ok. Time to go adventure lol
---
I enjoy it. There have always been bugs in creative. Many of us actually enjoy seeing old ones pop up, or how new ones come with new features. I don’t think greed has much to do with it.
---
No, those food types are prewar
---
Upvote.  I’m rushing out the door everytime.
---
They can be bought from the guy at the settlement that sells for bullion.  Not sure what reputation level you have to be at
---
If it was one of 3 options, I’m really hoping the others were the other plushies. I have an above max budget camp so I can’t place new things, but I can change existing items that are on the same line
---
need to fix desync damage first half my attacks don't get registered, anyone got this too?
---
I'm currently playing through Fallout 4, for the second time this month lol. I upgraded my PC a while back and lost all of my save files, so I'm going back through and doing my Faction play through's again. Currently working on the Minutemen.
---
It took a day or so after my renewal date for them the be delivered. Hang in there:)
---
If you don't think using the same engine for 2 decades is not greedy, You're blind as a bat.
---
You have options. Berry mentats and hard bargain. Get that charisma way up and I’m sure you can shave that down to 8-9000
---
I’d be surprised if it wasn’t honestly, so you should be fine.
---
I might be. But I can tell you I’m not filled with resentment either.
---
We kinda know by now it has something to do with playing near the reset time before or after, so why don't people just log off like an hour in advance and come back 1 or 2 hours after reset ?
---
I've been doing this  since the first day and i haven't got this bug happen to me once.
---
It's clear it should't happen at all to begin with and hopefully it'll be patched soon enough but with all we know so far if you don't take preventative measures on your end to at least try to reduce the chances of it happening, you're kind of asking for it to happen.
---
I was hiding in a bush earlier and a team comes around me and just puts down some frag mines nearby.
---
I died.
---
Where? My dailies reset and I had 3 objectives...
---
My pro tips ! Play the game have fun and dont worrie !  YOU DONT HAVE TO PLAY NW IF YOU DONT LIKE IT
---
People are going to have to get used to the fact that you're not supposed to casually get every reward as is convenient to you. The higher rewards are for the lunatics out there that want to dedicate to the SCORE system.
---
I got stealth as that's how I play in general anyway. Use to be a melee build but it's tough to do silos that way
---
Mine did the same. Nothing changed.
---
No not much NW...
---
Vampire is my favorite. Saved my squishy level 297 vault dweller many times. Vampire Mini Gun with heavy gun and vats perks.
---
I stopped playing this game a long time ago because it felt like every time I logged on, I had to deal with so much Stash management, crop harvesting, cooking and hunger/thirst management, ammo crafting, lead hunting, bulk junk selling, and perk card shuffling that I had very little time to actually do quests. I still subscribe to this sub because I want to see if changes to the game ever tempt me to pick it up again, but so far it hasn’t. Now I’m just waiting for a post where Bethesda announces they’re releasing a one player version (with an optional survival mode and unlimited storage). So yeah, log off, 76 will still be there if you ever miss it.
---
Petrichor Opiuo
---
Well for me nw is a survival mode where PvP is allowed (no sense worry it) but the main purpose it survive and hide and seek is the best way to survive, not going for kill every one
---
I found for me that Events where many ghouls/scorched spawn lets you make Quick XP too, like the fort defiance defense Thing and the guided Meditation Thing, and the raid in harpers fairy. Dont know the English names but i guess you know what i mean.
---
I came back for wastelanders and will come back for the next big story content update. All this grinding stuff is just not worth it.
---
PSA: Bethesda my micro e-peen is equal to my rl one so do something to make my e-Dick bigger!
---
You seem like a really happy person &amp; you probably have a lot of friends.
---
Awesome look for GT: Petrichor Opiuo
---
I'll add anyone willing to take out a queen or imposter
---
Explosive Gatling plasma by far.
---
Interesting.  I thought this a few days ago but can’t hit the bitch with my terrible throws 😂
---
Adrenaline perk is broken
---
They could even collect treasury notes once in a while
---
Cool deal I'll add ya. I've got private too but typically do queen runs on public so others can enjoy the experience as well
---
I have noticed that if you vats target something and then it runs behind cover, your shot will chase it and still connect. Vats tracking: it's a feature, not a bug lol. And I've seen the health rubber banding too.
---
Literally came across this the other day. I didn’t find gold bars. Just a note next to the bodies saying to “meet at the spot”                                                                Needless to say I never found “the spot”
---
Yea what about it
---
From the first day i filming this moment, when challenges updates. And this is the first time, i captured this bug. I did it, just to proof that this bug is real. I already have 40 lvl of season, and it's not a big loss for me to loose this 2k points.
---
Ah, the wiki said it is unused in game. Boo.
---
Bethesda rep: we will forward this to our team and add it for next season!
---
My luck is too good. However, if you see a weapon lying out and you shoot it a couple of times, it gets damaged—At least, every time I shot a weapon and picked it up, it was damaged and when I didn’t shoot it, it wasn’t damaged. I was able to damage enough weapons to finish the challenge.
---
I’m sure they all love being around you &amp; you spread so much positivity in the world. Thank you
---
Someone posted this last week, not sure if it's accurate but it's something to consider at least  
---

---
Evidence?
---
You get them a few days after you buy your month.  Once the money actually processes.
---
Jump on nexus mods. Download the different builds mod. One click for shotty or heavy. Plus the rest. Really a game changer in itself. 
---
 I got an ultracite gatling for scorchbeasts and it really is quite synergenic with a shotgun build. I only use 3 rank 1 shotgun cards and I one shot everything. 68 bloated, scorched, robots. 
---
Maybe I'm letting the cat out of the bag, but anyone with a shotty 33% vats, I will trade 30 legendaries for another one. 😉
---
Always get heavily crippled
---
For me it's not that. I run Building teams for the general XP gain. I'll only kick people off if they start following me around on my XP route killing enemies before I can get a shot in. Idc what level you are, but if you pull that shit, you're out.
---
Shoot his eye, he wont be that tough then
---
It’s in the game but it’s the same as formula p.
---
Not everyone rolls with broken builds, let's not calibrate these things for them.
---
I prefer discord but can also use snapchat.
---
Gone, reduced to... Atoms?
---
Get the shotty I mentioned. Levels 1 through 47 sucked. Then I found someone selling for 1500. Bought it and it became a new game for me. 
---
That and the Chinese armor, OP 😆
---
Are there the old reward still available?
---
From my personal experience, Acid Extractors have a hard cap of 10 acid they can store. I dont know how fast they produce, but i know they cap out at 10 acid.
---
Learn to manage your weight.
---
But does your high priest have a deep, southern accent?
---
I bought it yesterday and got them right away. I went through the bethesda shop. If you went through steam it might be delayed
---
If it even was able to play "as intended" facing so many bugs and network errors.
---
DON'T YOU DARE LOOK AT MY TREE
---
I won the 1st match i was dropped in and ended up leveling up haha the Fallout gods are smiling on me today.
---
I think destiny 2 definitely had the right idea by getting rid of the leveling system. I didnt notice how bad it was till they got rid of it. Other game developers should learn from this.
---
From the PTS release. We can hope that that's what makes it to the game. Should be a fun event.
---
The tenderizer looks great with power armor
---
I had some twat with a shotgun point blank one shotting the Legendaries as they were still climbing out of the ground at uranium fever. Like come on man, I don't want the Legendary itself, I just need a tag on it for my score.
---
I have a JE dobble bareal and you really don't need to do nothing in vats it kills all in one shot, I'm running rifleman
---
Thanks. Too much work to add 2 INT to my alt to level up faster
---
Love the Chinese armor. If I can wear clothes over that bulky af marine or raider armor, why can't I wear clothes over this?
---
Just started using a vats shotty, love the ka-blam and it one shots most things with vats.
---
Asked yourself once if they even want your stuff?
---
There are so many people scared to join random group invites since it was so easy to grief them, also there are so many illegal items out even veteran players are scared to pick up anything they don't get themself from the game.
---
She hates anyone who kills about 50 mole miners per hour
---
Improved repair kits from the sbq progress the challenge
---
Just change to pressure plate on both sides.
---
I think there are more players farming that event for gold tickets so they just want it to end faster. Definitely screws over players that want to farm it for cap or just want them to go in. I only do that event on private because always too much drama with it.
---
+1
---
Hell yes
---
That's exactly what I am indeed.
---
I have considered the new character route, but whatever path I take, I still have to scratch up the armour set (which will be no mean feat) but my current main has the perk cards already from previously being a rifleman and I've got enough points in reserve to make the changes. Coupled with the them being considerably further ahead in rep, gold and storyline it's ultimately less of a grind for me to tweak the main instead if I go down that path.
---
Going to keep grinding for a few more weeks then see what the land lays after that, get a bit further along the legendary run and all. The one major thing holding me back is that I just finished my T-65 this week and it seems a shame to not get it into the field.
---
I get you &amp; totally agree. 
---
We've told Bethesda over &amp; over since Wastelanders launched &amp; they've only piled on further &amp; made it worse. It's by design. 
---
They want you to pay cash to get rid of the oppressive feeling from inventory management. 
---
They want you to spend money on Atoms to stop you feeling overwhelmed from constantly having to chase the legendary run challenges.
---
They want you to login daily to complete these challenges &amp; grind out faction rep &amp; bullion.
---
Bethesda truly doesn't give a shit about whether you're depressed or have an addictive personality. They prey on it.
---
Maybe it's time you step away from the game, for your own mental health. Bethesda sure as hell isn't going to change in any real way so unfortunately it's up to you.
---
Where does it say that it will take that long.
---
They spawn on a timer, inside and out for all players on that server. It may be an hour or two. They also spawn partially after a while if that makes sense.
---
If it auto completes, you usually don't get score. It's just moved to the completed side so you can't do it.
---
So you are just an asshole. Ok.
---
Bethesda has found a way to get people to team up, sadly it’s hard to get them to be a team. I feel your pain. At the end of the day I decided to try and do my part and just lead by example. For the times it doesn’t work, attempt to let go of the resentment.
---
Then it doesn't heal enough and you die anyways 😔
---
plus berry mentats and brain bombs and herbivore (or carnivore and substitute broiled scorchbeast brain and tasty squirrel stew)
---
They do and tbh not that much everyone too sinsitive like bullying is needed yk and anytime broskie
---
I’ve only bought ammo machine, guass mini, guass shotgun, guass pistol , plasma caster and all secret service armor plus under armor. Only thing I didn’t buy was the mask being it does nothing. Guess I’ll buy the strangler power armor next. I didn’t regret any purchases except one and that’s the jet pack. I used it at first but I spent 2000 on it and I have not put it on my unyielding chest piece so if I gotta say worst it would be that. And yes I get all the floater grenades and I never spent gold on them
---
That way no-one is happy.  The pve crowd will resent being forced even further into the battle royale mode, whilst the pvp lot get saddled with a load of pve'ers who are only there to get dailies done and don't care about winning.
---
A better way would be to have 10 dailies that can be done in both game modes.  For example:
---
Kill 30 creatures or NW: kill 5 creatures      S.C.O.R.E (250)  
---
Level up! or NW: increase Overseer Rank      S.C.O.R.E (500)  
---
Kill 3 legendary enemies or NW: kill a Player      S.C.O.R.E (250)  
---
etc.
---
That way people who prefer one game mode over another can exclusively get their S.C.O.R.E. done in the game mode of their choosing.  And people that enjoy both can dip in and out as they please, but aren't advantaged by having double the pool of potential dailies; which is why it would be do XXX in Adventure Mode or XXX in Nuclear Winter for the same reward.
---
Or you see ur health bar increase while knocked
---
Try the mountainside bed and breakfast, there is a holo outside the building on a table. No chest.
---
I believe AngryTurtle on YouTube made a video about the specifics related to this it long ago.
---
Nope, was on PC!
---
Does that backpack mod also make food last longer?
---
I would love to. I’m eastern Us and I don’t have anyone that can play when I play and when I am in a public team no one is dropping nukes that much. Also I have 11 nuke cards
---
Sometimes I would get knocked and just stand back up lmao
---
My best advise is this; wait for a nuke to pop. After the SBQ goes down, wait about 30 seconds and go spawn the encrypted event. It’s your best chance to get peoples attention.
---
Only problem is FO76 is not Bethesda trying new things, it's Bethesda trying to copy companies like Rockstar and get a piece of that sweet sweet microtransaction pie.
---
Yup, I moved camp locations just cuz I felt like my subconscious was forcing me to babysit the thing
---
70 Intelligence!  Wow!  That's the highest I've personally heard of someone achieving  
---
I max out at just under 50 or so, myself
---
Zombified by todd. A devil or god?
---
Lol.that was me 2 days ago.i did this tactic.it was great.just a huge pile of bodies.
---
Why do I need a mod for builds? And I use PLM already. And again not that lucky and don't enjoy shotguns.
---
Try restarting? Did you already have a subscription?
---
Yup. Sometimes don't even want to complete challenges at all.
---
On PlayStation so that's probably why
---
He would be using unyielding armor with a bloodied build like me I would expect
---
Unyielding armor at max  = + 3 to all stats (except endurance ) per piece X5 for full set +15 to all stats
---
 Love 30 agility
---
I couldnt agree more. We were on game last night. And with the Dailies being Kill 3 legendaries, a user came in and waited at the end of the event route for the LEGENDARY sheepsquatch to spawn and knocked him in 2 shots. Everyone was so pissed. He then found us later and killed everyone in the teams and killed them all upon respawn. Such a jerk move, and makes it not fun to play.
---
I'm just going to wait 48 hours first to see if they show up
---
I haven’t noticed any increased instability
---
The only time this is a problem is when 10 bloodied show up for the Encrytid event.  
---
No one wants to touch the pylons.
---
As if any build in fallout is hard work, Honestly if bethesda just balanced enemies instead of just going the good old bullet sponge route then there would difference in builds
---
Expeditions will be just instances.
---
Out of boundaries map is only to make the map feel like a world, would be abstract to just have nothing there.
---
Also, the developer had to shrink the playable area, since the release  got too close they limited the whole area. Looking on a wiki page you will find several locations marked outside which are cut due the release pressure.
---
If you have the correct build definetly yes. Also in price
---
The airport design was changed about a year ago. The guides you are using are probably out of date. It’s a pretty linear path through the airport though, you shouldn’t really need a guide. Just go on through. Find the keycard. Open door and keep heading through.
---
That would be my only complaint right now. Can't wear anything over Chinese armor. 😔
---
Everyone else enjoys outfits except us stealth wearers.
---
I accidentally did this during heart of the swamp.i felt so bad.cause the 2 lower levels did the confused emote.so i gave them a bunch of legendary stuff i had from doing the cycle of events and they did the heart emote..
---
If youre doing this use motolovs. Dont activate the turret either.  some us want to loot the bodies after and not have them fling everywhere
---
Nah I think your post just gives more of a reason to get rid of this bug tbh
---
Vault Dweller, I need spices!
---
1,000 xp per kill, I would LOVE that!  I usually average around 400-500 xp per high level kill
---
I'll take them inert bombs if you don't want them
---
They make op mines
---
I caved and bought one month. I instantly had
---
The atoms. I would seriously suggest restarting the game.
---
I was running uranium fever today and a level 200+ just melted a legendary right in front of me without even letting me get a hit off on him, I pulled my mic down like bro stop being greedy and let other people tag the enemy as well. I can’t stand playing events with greedy ass players
---
happy cake day, wanderer!
---
Wasn't this supposed to be for the double score weekend?
---
Aye. It starts with one clownshoe standing by the door. Then someone goes to the door. Then someone goes outside. Then someone else goes on the roof. Clownshoe leapfrog. And it's like.. stop it. Same with line in the sand. Everyone else waits in the generator area and someone gonk sits on the wall with their B2525 HM and steals all the Xp.
---
And Radiation Rumble. The number of times i've failed that because nobody collects ore is.. a lot. I always heal the NPCs and i have no problem keeping both sides covered from my little spot. Other people can see i'm the only one keeping the NPCs alive and don't think 'Maybe i should grab some ore' Even just enough to get rank 1. BUT NOOOOOOOO! Also. When i'm stood there slicing away with my magic flaming sword of healing and there's ghouls all over me i have to stop healing to kill them but then any healing i had done is pointless as the npc takes damage. Stop sitting at the entrance to the tunnels and defend from the middle ya pillocks.
---
It’s a small drum?
---
It's basically the hunger games with heavy artillery.
---
Oh, I see. The new challenges are completed as they come in.  
---
Yeah that's not good.  
---
I was watching this today as they came popping up, but thankfully they didn't pop up as completed.  
---
Sorry for your loss.
---
You're not
---
The XP systems for the two challenges work differently, the Halloween event stacks XP, 14,000 total for all rewards
---
The xmas rewards require the full amount listed for each reward, for a total of 27,001 xp
---
We'll get it, it's just going to take ages
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Overseer_rank

NO. NOOO. IT'LL CAUSE ANOTHER 496 BUGS. PLEASE. GOD. NO.
---
I am new in F76, isn't PvP damage significally reduced? Do you mean it gets sexy violent later on? I am level 15
---
1500¢
---
Edited: put the 3rd claw
---
Maybe I will! Lol
---
If they don't kill me right away I just turn the game off.
---
Hit me up @ javahart
---
May be on in a bit, defo on Sunday night.
---
Lol "it would take less than five minutes ".  This is not true for anything related to software development.
---
If I think a decent battle will happen I slap on “field surgeon.” It makes rad and stims work faster.
---
I always go naked and hide lol everyone always shoots me when they find me :( 
---
Where’s my bush Wookie friend lol
---
Lower level itemsi thought takes less resources to repair at times.  Maybe use a level 1 pipe or melee and bash it against stuff?
---
&gt;They added more based on feedback, but that doesn't mean that a full chimpout was required to provide that feedback
---
Sometimes the only way these companies understand is by chimping out and not buying anything. Bethesda could've easily taken care of this with a simple statement that would've taken two seconds to post just like with the ammo converter. 
---
"Hey guys we heard you on the score, don't worry we're gonna make it easier for you guys to get score later on in the run!" 
---
The killer thing here was the clear lack of communication. That's the entire point.
---
So I run a shotgun build, heavy build, and pistol build. I only switch out certain cards of course, but my build does adapt to each weapon I choose. 
---
So for me, swapping out cards for harvesting flux, building/crafting/cooking and also hacking/Lockpicking. Oh and team builds. 
---
So I'd rather spend only a second swapping cards compared to a minute figuring out what i need or dont need for each build. 
---
If you dont like shottys thats fine. Just was a tip. 
---
And can I ask, what is PLM?
---
Probably need to invest a few points in that
---
I want in! I already wear that outfit everyday
---
Yeah but this is like hide and seek during the purge. No bad sports, only hurt egos.
---
I've also noticed the trend for players to stand outside during OVN rather than within the shed. The predicable spawns and limited entry points unfortunately make it a bit of a free for all. Attended for the first time in an age last night and twigged on quickly. With none making it inside I  jumped out and above the door where I had a good viewpoint. Didn't really want to but the alternative was no tags for xp. 
---
Radiant Rumble has been plagued by stationary PA Heavies for a while, although a new trend seems to be Gauss Shotguns facing down the tunnels shooting me in the back as much as the enemies in the face. I've pretty much given up with it as an event.
---
Spent the last 2 hours doing nothing in the game.  Waiting on the scrip machine to reset.  Waiting on the gold bullion to reset.  Waiting on the vendors to reset.  Waiting on the reputation dailies to reset. 
---
Fuck I just want to progress in a few sessions, over 2 days.  I work full time during the week.
---
Thanks for coming back with this info
---
Somebody help me out here, 'cause I don't see anything happening other than the previous day's challenges removing (slowly) and the new day's appearing. (I don't read Russian)
---
The SCORE in the upper right corner stays level 39, with 325/1950, and the atoms stay at 2760. I didn't see any points getting lost.
---
I do see that all but two of the "new" daily challenges show up as already completed, so I guess what you're saying is you didn't get the rewards for "completing" those challenges?
---
400-500 still Sounds great to me!
---
Outlaw pass was a perfect “grind”.  No challenges to worry about just play the game and you leveled quick.
---
You sir are a gentleman and a scholar! Thank you!
---
Why don't you like em? Legit question. I want at least one explosive where I can just open up if I need to do crowd control or to screw around with. Like a 50 calmachine gun. I'm partial to laser or plasma Gatling myself.
---
A titanic moment.
---
It sucks you have to lose some perk points to it. But I barley use Charisma for anything other than extra xp perks or selling/buying bonus.
---
Didn’t even dawn on me that high luck doesn’t necessarily mean raw SPECIAL stats. Oof.
---
Perk Loadout Manager
---
I used to do that long ago. But now only if I’m within the first 5-8 deaths at the start. Early enough to get a new game going and I’m clearly not going to sit there and watch my teammates wander about for 10+ minutes doing dick all.
---
Punk radio guy works fine.
---
Unfortunately so. It's a rather nasty side effect of being surrounded by morons for so long
---
They did.
---
In certain dubious forums alot of ppl crying they got banned within a few hours after they read the dupe tutorial.
---
It's funny to see what's possible and see which fate they have to face.
---
Yeah, got strange in numbers too, but only use it too pass speech checks ( mines at 7 with a perk that gives plus 1 for each teamate)
---
I read somewhere that the final log is not available until you go to the launch nuke site.
---
red dead 2's online pass is completable in a week or 2. when there is one its the best bp in industry IMO
---
Well I am only there for the score anyway, not levels.  I don't have time to wait around until I die.
---
Unless of course it's a level up challenge. Then I'll stay and get the XP.
---
These people are awesome. Im allways that guy when I see the legendary in uranium fever. And it really pisses me off when I call people to get here and some jerk one shots the legendary.
---
Apologies. That is the correct name of the mod. I was speaking of the same mod. Enjoying a party with my family and should have looked up the name of the mod. Laziness won. Apologies.
---
Go to low level vendors like the forrest lots if cheap stuff, repair it sell it back.
---
I used to think this game was a grind.  
---
Then I made a bloodied build.
---
I have a mod that changes the classical radio and it's on there. "YOOOranium FEEEver, done and got me down!"
---
Because it's made out of a tin can and wire hanger? I understand  the frustration, but they're supposed to be  beginner, kinda crap weapons. And this is from the guy that bought 3 levels of licensed plumber.
---
Exactly.
---
Grinding is just a genre at this point. A lot of people (myself included) enjoy it. The best thing is to enjoy games as games, not tasks, it is time you spend on fun and distraction, every human being needs it. Imagine being born in 100 B.C. with no Fallout 76 or even proper bathrooms. Come on bro, just play it when you feel like wandering Fallout's world, or maybe your thing are fast paced games like God of War/Ps4's exclusives or Overwatch/any FPS Idk.
---
This apparently can get you banned too!
---
&gt; Sometimes the only way these companies understand is by chimping out 
---
no
---
&gt; and not buying anything.
---
yes. And how many people cancelled their 1st subs over this? How many are refusing to buy atoms from now? Nowhere near as many as came here to make some whine posts, I can promise you that
---
The lack of communication on bethesda's part is definitely a fault and should have been handled earlier. But this is not unexpected, every time there has been a major crisis they took too long to respond. Ffs we already saw this happen with the seasons before, when people started getting upset about future ones being paid and they took a week to say that it's not going to be the case. Maybe their minds were not yet made up, maybe their PR can never get hold of anybody up the ladder, maybe they're just all around incompetent. Regardless of where their fault lies, it doesn't excuse people here acting equally incompetent.
---
Source link? Pics? Imgur?
---
Was going to be upset if no one mentioned this.
---
I was doing uranium fever with a bunch of other high levels and we were all tagging the legendaries and waiting to let everyone get a shot in, but we'd sit there for a long time and no one would kill it just in case someone hadn't hit it yet. It was hilarious. 
---
But then the next event there was a lvl 400 with an explosive plasma just wasting everything before anyone got a shot off. Some people just kinda suck, but most are decent folk.
---
What apparel are you trying to get? I may have some extra you can have.
---
As you were describing it I was starting to think that's what you meant. But yeah I've built decks for plenty, and I have one for shotgun/auto rifles. I just don't have a shotgun for it and it's again mostly for the challenge, the auto rifle on the other handle is for this beautiful quad explosive railway rifle I got. Slapped an auto receiver on it and it destroys everything... well if I can keep it steady long enough
---
hell yea
---
Between that effect, weapon weight reduction armour, and melee weapon reduction, I was able to get items as low as 0.02lbs.
---
Just wondering if there's many attachments other than MIRV that increase a massive amount?
---
if it was faster fire rate instead of faster reload it would probly kill queen in 1 or 2 mags. magic weapons are best if over 200 fire rate. they still kinda work if close but below 200
---
access to perk cards depends on your level, not your special. at level 115 they definitely should be in there somewhere, master heavy gunner unlocks at level 50 and expert at level 40
---
Except for the most part,  the "new content" is grinding through loops of old (since day 1) content for meager spoils in the form of new items/cosmetics.
---
They're talking about a separate PvP game mode called Nuclear Winter. It's like a battle royale mode for Fallout 76, even though it's typically played more like post-apocalyptic hide and seek.
---
it's rigged!
---
I thought it was? Maybe it was taken out or I’m just delusional lol
---
Nothing I enjoy more then a little R&amp;R on uncle sams dime
---
only sometimes
---
Ive tried this before, for some odd reason I'm in the game a little longer before the game kicks me out
---
Thank you for pointing this out.
---
When is it not
---
I want to try a bloodied but I love my junkies build too much
---
Gonna need evidence that the other formula is in-fact in the game.
---
I'd be happy if this happened. I'm here for gold and I'd say about 75% of the time im there it fails because NOT ENOUGH people are killing ghouls.
---
@AngryFucc I didn't have this issue. But instead you could right click edit the file copy the contents of the file paste it into a new blank. Click file save as and name it project76.ini just keep a separate copy of this as fallout seems to remove the read only property and delete it afterwards. 
---
Alternatively if it doesn't let you click edit I can PM you the contents of the ini file.
---
this, junkies shotgun is a "magic" weapon in vats. no build needed
---
when they are toxic
---
Ah ok it was just I got killed by a name similar to yours on here lol
---
Wym
---
Definitely if it was the hoarding dupers from the first time around but sucks for the legit legacy owners cause it was a unique item for them those are the only people I felt bad for
---
So I've not finished wastelanders on my heavy gunner so I've not had chance to play with the gauss minigun but I have used most other other heavy guns and I would say 'It depends'
---
If you like good solid and consistant with ok ammo consumption, if a little boring then go for a b25 50cal.
---
If you enjoy making everything, including yourself go boooooom splat then explosive gatling plasma (loads of fun but super easy to blow yourself up and weirdly not that effective against scorchbeasts, and useless against the queen)
---
If you want to end a sbq fight quickly then grab a junkies or instigating ffr minigun. (yawn) 
---
But for general use, for me it's got to be the lmg (I have a b limb which might be a little bugged - not sure, but in any case it shreds) , it's like using a handmade but with more 'oomph'. The only downside is that it literally guzzles .308 and you feel like your constantly reloading the damn thing.
---
Personally I carry all of the above and swap as the mood takes me - but to each their own :)
---
I had someone tell me they do it to devalue items so people can get them without paying real money. Chaotic good I guess?
---
Its not that they didnt get the reward for them. Its that you cant then earn them that day, since the game thinks you already got them.
---
No one is asking for "free" rewards. Wht they are asking for is the chance to earn those rewards rather than the game make them unavailable
---
"item does not have proper support" pops up most of the time I do this.  I normally don't have this issue when it's part of the roof that has side support. But, if it's in the middle, and relies on the other roof pieces, it doesn't like the collision that isn't actually there, but thinks it is.
---
like the duped modded in weapons that launch mini nukes or some shit then sell them for 40 dollars on ebay
---
but yea some are cool
---
It irks the hell out of me that they put a shovel on the backpack.  The whole point of a Ghillie suit is you can hide in a bush and not have to dig a hole and crawl into it like a common grunt.  Plus, obviously, it sticks up, and is metal, so it defeats the whole purpose of the suit. 
---
Totally immersive breaking.  I was looking forward to it, but now I've taken the skin off and am using the plain backpack skin which is much more stealth.
---
C'mom Bethesda, think about these things a bit.
---
I would only trust what people have said on here so much. Some straight out lie and some get confused on details.
---
There's a few hard determined things that have been known to activate this and if you avoid them then for at least 90% of people it seems to not be an issue. 
---
It's annoying you have to do workarounds at all but when I see people saying they've had the issue 20+ times or something they either are being dumb or lying cause most people seem to be avoiding this by just not being on during the rollover.
---
that makes sense, been on a NW roll and then every once in awhile head into adventure to check out the craftable crap I'm getting from leveling up
---
Like the body piece that goes with the imposter sheepsquatch helmet
---
Thanks mate 😂😂
---
But if you wear PA then you can’t benefit from unyielding armour.  I ditched PA as a true bloodied unyielding
---
Zombies but with ghouls lmao
---
I had to pick the card, I just hadn't in the past. I think I over complicated it for myself.
---
Yes. It is my "problem solver."
---
Under ideal conditions I can reach 120 or higher damage per shot against the SBQ - it melts most enemies, although I'm not a heavy build. 
---
Heavy as heck once you mod it, and it isn't my main weapon, but good to have
---
just wish they'd find a way to dupe the measly few bucks in my wallet..
---
You dont need to read the words to see that the new challenges are arriving in greyed out and therefore completed already. They arent getting the SCORE from them either.
---
I mean you can take the high road. And then again, and again  and again. How many times you want to watch dupe waves come and go with no ramifications to those who exploit before you just say f* it and get to having fun with fun weapons.
---
Ya I really only use my private server for transferring items to my low level character and to farm crafting components. I love doing the queen fight so I’m always down, it’s the best source of xp imo
---
heres a rounded walls primer https://youtu.be/2AyA3qa8X24?t=282
---
Well, you can use the NW suit in NW without armor.  If you're just being a bush bunny and running out the clock, it's perfect.   Very hard to see someone with the suit if they are crouched in a good bush.
---
Because people complained.  Same thing with handmade
---
Ok I get it now, thanks. I was just mixed up by the phrasing of "losing points" - to me you can't lose what you never got in the first place.
---
I agree it should be fixed. All that Beth will probably do out of that video though is fix the $GotoSeasons tag on the bottom.
---
I have a 430 carry wieght with no deep pocketed mods on my heavy build.
---
I didn't have this issue. But instead you could right click edit the file copy the contents of the file paste it into a new blank notepad file. Click file save as and name it project76.ini just keep a separate copy of this as fallout seems to remove the read only property and delete it afterwards.
---
.
---
I always die to SBQ but I’m hitting her for over 1k every swing but get targeted by every mob.  Unlike the laser tent sitters 🤣
---
Wear power armor and it stims you instantly 
---
Otherwise you can't stim unless your character isn't already doing an action like reloading
---
It's just junk. Don't let that ruin your game
---
Trust me as a former PA addict that is false
---
Suicide is illegal (sarcasm)
---
Indeed, this isn't something that can be done easily in the Creation Kit. That said, it is their engine, so I'm sure it could be added by altering the underlying game code - but that's probably going to be a lot of work, by a person with skills that would be put to better work on stuff like fixing major bugs.
---
Which were those?
---
I know only of the ones removing charisma.
---
Ayo I was the 1000th upvote can I get one upvote for that
---
I’m not even that high of a level and I do this. So fun to get thumbs up from people lol.
---
Thanks! =)
---
Sit in the goddamn barn, idiots (for the campers)
---
Yeah, "denied chance to earn" would be closer. Since they went from having 7 challenges to now having 9, it seems their plan is "maybe you'll earn them tomorrow!"
---
Thanks =)
---
Tagging u/LadyDevann and u/Valseek to see this!
---
? Since when?  Are you thinking adrenaline?
---
Like both the scout masks
---
Also strange that the creature challenge came in at 15/20?
---
I get pissed when people don't close the front door at my camp
---
Thanks, you are right.
---
You probably know this already but uranium fever event and west Tek are the best to find multiple legendaries in one go. And west Tek helps with leveling up
---
Jeez don’t do that lol. Worried me a minute!
---
Big fan of this and I try to do it whenever possible. Especially if there are low level players hanging about...👍
---
Fucking for real. I love fallout, but it’s just becoming too much for me in 76. I don’t like the grind one bit.
---
Thanks, I wasn't aware.
---
It's not so much because dying has no penalty (since a well made Bloodied build is rarely dying anyway). The reason they are so popular is because they are the highest DPS build and nearly all the content is designed to be beaten with raw DPS. With the exception of the Encrypted (which is easiest with at least one Tank) and the former Vault Raids (which also benefited from Tankier players) basically everything else is most easily accomplished with a high-DPS build.
---
There's also the psychological aspect of seeing higher numbers and feeling rewarded. Even if you're overkilling most enemies by 500% it just feels good seeing your damage in the thousands. DPS classes are almost always the most popular in games because people feel rewarded when they are able to defeat enemies faster.
---
If Bethesda wanted to reduce the popularity of Bloodied builds they would have to start making more content that rewards players for deciding to play as a Tank or Support. They could also do a lot more so you could more easily craft a Tank or Support build. Right now 90% of perks and effects revolve around DPS or QOL, and most of the ones that are for Tanks and Support are terrible.
---
can i just ask what a WMD is?
---
Is more active, but there are more low level players per server, meaning less eficient players in hard events. Also they have less money and they buy less stuff from vendors
---
Why not just bash a few times? Reduces the condition much faster than shooting for many weapons (notable exceptions being The Dragon and missile launchers).
---
I have (unfortunately) seen the Chally Mascot outfit... its pure nightmare inducing horror
---
But...that's a backpack mod the jetpacks an armor mod you can have both
---
It kind of reminds me of the song the puppets sing to welcome the visitors in the remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
---
And super sneaky from AGI bonus!
---
Just u wait the remaster for skyrim announcement is coming
---
Nice job of using the environment. Those are my favourite CAMPS to come across.
---
Not sure about the location though. Regular Scorchbeasts would be a pain in the arse. Found a nice spot the other day and considered it but then noticed the fissure nearby and noped it
---
The drum mag for 10mm smg is 45, and it only weighs like 5 when fully modded. Amazing weapon.
---
https://youtu.be/6LkHWZFYSYw Juicehead also talks about it in his latest video
---
Need to get lucky from murgulgurglgulll
---
Welp, I know what I’m doing when I get bored
---
Its random.
---
Nope. 
---
You can only have 1 at your camp
---
Where'd you find the good boy?
---
Haven’t seen an album but this video shows most of it https://youtu.be/6LkHWZFYSYw
---
From the modules?
---
Line in the sand has become a complete lag fest for me. 2 frames per second it seems like.
---
I am lame as fuck. Ill admit it. But Im pretty keen to get that thing lol
---
I think it's a little funny that I just got a notification for this post on my phone and not only did I just do an event where I waved the other players over to get a hit on the legendary's (it was Uranium Fever) but that this post was made 6 hours ago and that when I saw the title for like 2 seconds I actually thought it was the same people I just did Uranium Fever with 🤣🤣. 
---
Q: BTW why did I get a notification? 🤔 is it cause of the amount of likes?
---
Note: not that it matters but in case any of you were curious I was actually the lowest level there so I was calling the Biggie's over 😁.
---
Yes the modules is random * amount.
---
Fucking RNG as to whether the game will use the stimpack or whatever chem you got hotkeyed.
---
you're thinking of the 90% reduced weight mod
---
There's perks for both field surgeon and first aid that help with both parts.
---
Just random luck. Put down your 2 modules and hope for something good. Scrip the trash.
---
Accept death as part of life
---
It is an extra weekly, giving another 1,000 points per week.
---
Then a couple of extra dailies per day. It is thousands of points extra a week.
---
get a farm going and dispense it at your camp
---
Sweet thank you! Can you get them from Murmph too or just the modules
---
Reading's for nerds (as I push my glasses up).
---
What do you mean by this? Like people not reading the objective for events?
---
 https://imgur.com/uHiXWuY
---
Hey now when I can i hide in a polowski shelter or portapottie hahahaha
---
I have problems
---
I'm so glad for private servers because of this. At level 297, I'm usually one of the highest people in a group (I see a level 518 occasionally-wow) but I am kind of forgetful about stacking my perks to my weapon. So my bloodied two shot does 89 damage because I left all the perks on melee and kept my health topped off. And then some level 70 with a god mode scatter shot type weapon one shots an entire group before anyone else gets a hit. But I'm the highest in the room so it's my fault. 
---
I usually run around with a vampire knife if I play in a group now. I can get enough hits to get drops but I won't one shot most things and it lets others have a chance too.
---
Thank you so much! 💚
---
Yeah if I couldn't lead them away and just wait for em to land it would be a pain. Thankfully they only really notice like half of the time. 
---
Bonus is the rock overhang protects against the poison mist, and the blasts can't seem to find a good angle to hit anything under it, so most I end up repairing is like 20 wood and 20 bone from the junk outside.
---
This feels like your butthurt cause you got ignored.  Just saying.
---
Last year one of the rewards for completing the Meat Week event was a two handed melee weapon that was part  street sign pole, beer keg and naval mine in order to look like a giant salt shaker. You could also earn 3 different mods for it but you could never learn the actual plan for it which was disappointing since we can’t legendary variants of it
---
Weapons of Mass Destruction
---
https://youtu.be/6LkHWZFYSYw
---
Yeah that's what I'm confused about. Why didn't they talk about it? I'm worried it's just a mistake haha
---
Upvote for the sincerity
---
Bugger off, cheaters are not welcome here.
---
I like to make sure the person/people running for ore in Radiation Rumble get at least some legendaries at the end. I try my best to find them after the event and slide some their way.
---
Everything literally had a new player telling me tou can't repair equipment and that you can kill ghouls with radiation
---
Really? :|
---
Downing never should have been a thing for the mode anyway, it'd actually make it feasible for solo players to enjoy the mode more if they can take on a squad without having to execute everyone (which stupidly is on a delay as well).
---
Ooh you got me. (Eyebrows raised)I WANT IT...
---
I think you can, if you choose the random legendary ranged weapon (1 star, 2, 3). There is a *chance* it will be a Gauss Shotgun now that you know the plan. More than likely it will be something else. If you're trying to get a certain Gauss shotty, you're probably better off buying the modules and crafting yourself. At least you're guaranteed they are Gauss Shotguns.
---
Oh. I had no idea about that
---
Opposite I gnore the wrong guy if you where to believe his threats
---
You know. If more and more people cheat the legendary run they'll probably introduce max spaces you can move in a week. And then people will have something else to complain about. 
---
People have already hit 100 by playing properly and just getting LOTS of XP and grinding. Clownshoes!
---
The number of people who can't or don't use conjunctions correctly or can't use periods to create sentences in this game is insanely staggering.  I don't think it should be called the people of fallout anymore, but maybe the people of ironyhahaha.
---
Just saying.
---
&gt;ame is installed on a secondary drive (so not where Windows is) try going to Windows settings &gt; apps, find it in the list and click 'move'

&gt;I had the same "no region ping 1 5 1" error but once it had moved over to my C:/ drive, it wor
---
 That is not a Fix, that is a workaround. In modern age gaming, with multiple harddrives and extremely large games. Installing on any drive, should be accounted for in development. This is poor on Bethesda and Microsoft both. 
---
You can get level 45 at Uranium Fever.
---
Damn. I was just going to test this.
---
Yeah for sure, thanks for the help.
---
BuT nO SuPpREssoR
---
fucking love my 10mm smg, feeding it on the otherhand...
---
This is going fast to top three Bethesda's concerns
---
Thats not too bad then if youre getting natural protection from most of the damage. Id still rather not bother personally. I like my CAMP peaceful. I may scout for an overhang elsewhere though. I have an idea of my own of how i might incorporate one in a build
---
At least you can wear any hat and it still works. My guy wears a bowler hat and 3D glasses lol
---
It's one of the best features in the game
---
Yeah... you aren't going to get answered here 😂
---
Its more than possible to catch up at this stage.
---
Grab some xp buffs (well rested, canned meat stew, etc) and get grinding
---
If I wasn't completely in love with the overhang I probably wouldn't tbh. 
---
Lemme know if you find a good one! There were a few I tried before but they all had other issues I couldn't rectify.
---
You know they are banning people for this right?
---
Nothing happens. It doesn’t work.
---
You're a saint! Thanks so much for putting this together. I'm still a fair bit behind Zorbo so this should definitely help!
---
I just buy it from players camps, nobody else ever buys it cos everyone wants 5.56! 
---
I sell all my good ammo like 5.56, .50, 5mm to get the caps back. Better system that the ammo converter.
---
Me too man feels good to have literally everything I want. 
---
reminds me of the world of warcraft episode of south park
---
“what do you mean? now we get to play the game!”
---
I was bored at the Rusty Pick. So I passed my time playing with the diner matic. I did not think I would get it. But, I have a YouTube video of my 15 minute play and success. I have gotten a pie 3 times. When I need to waste time. You may see me playing in the wasteland.
---
Yes I wouldn’t be surprised if this for weekends, so people can make up if they lost a day during the week. 
---
It’s nice.
---
Not sure why but my acid extracter holds 14
---
So just a heads up - I play this same set up daily without issue, one X and one S (and have run up to 4 Xbox from one house, all on one team on 76).
---
Could be bad luck - but you could also need to check your internet or look into getting some boosters.
---
I got em all, but right now it's all about XP! Not just for score but for the impending Legendary Perks. 
---
So what do I wear? Anything that adds INT. that means casual underarmor, and all my armor limbs (even have a raider arm, which is otherwise shit). Only one is SS, so i am working to upgrade all my SS to +1 Int. I make up for the weakness with Cranberry Grinder, Deathclaw Steak, Glowing steak, Scaly skin, etc.
---
Exact same thing happened to me!
---
I absolutely agree with you
---
Trying... New things?
---
LOL ok!
---
friends are friends, even if they make the wrong choice.
---
Bethesda cant design weapons worth a fuck ....   
---
Short answer.  
---
Long answer.  
---
Revolvers are typically a low calibre.  Given the time period .38 &amp; .45 revolvers shoulda been prolific.  
---
Hunting rifles would also come in 5.56,  
---
Theres a buncha types of shotgun ammo.

Wheres the BAR &amp; M1911.....

Good to know it's not just me! I renewed mine on the 9th. I contacted Bethesda support and they said there's nothing they can do since it was bought on Steam. I contacted Steam support and they said there's nothing they can do because it's In-Game rewards. But they immediately took my money...
---
It's a long shot but any chance /u/ladydevann or /u/valseek could shed some light on us?
---
So I just waste a serum. Damn.
---
Those people also havent taken a shit in a week because theyve been staring at a screen 24/7. Bethesda has fucked us over repeatedly, its only fair we take advantage of exploits when they arise
---
I didn't even know Meat Week was coming back! Anyone know when?
---
Most likely they are like with Fasnacht
---
Really, haven't seen any posts on this.
---
Sounds good!
---
Yes Juicehead confirms this in his latest video around 25:40
---
Yep. Once you learn the plan it gets added to legendary drop pool so you’ll have a chance at getting a legendary variant now. Hoping for a 90% reduced weight one since the normal variant is 20 pounds
---
The post got removed as it was unhealthy. Turns out they did 81 hours in 4 days and had like 10 hours sleep or something. 
---
Yeah. You use your exploits and then we'll all suffer just because you cannot just play the game properly.
---
Because most people aren't dopey enough to post they're doing it
---
Smh not even subtle about it
---
Nobody has completed it, but we all have the challenge yes.
---
Post about doing it properly?
---
Yep! Bethesda released a roadmap for the season and Meat Week is returning  August 18 to the 24
---
I was down about 10 points per shot on the queen today. I thought it was just me.
---
Grenades are definitely the worst.
---
I hate how reliant everyone in todays society is on youtube. Cant you just exerience anything yourself for the first time or does everything need to be served up on a silver platter guiding you and your opinions with each click of the button.
---
Wait the other guy says I'd waste the latest serum. If it replaces the old one,that's awesome.
---
Yeah I was the last person on a server yesterday and it did that.. it starts a 30 minute timer saying “the servers are shutting down for maintenance” 
---
I hadn’t seen that for awhile and the way it was worded made me think maybe it was a hot fix but nope, I was wrong
---
I try to,but a lot of the time I end up only letting one/two people get a hit,as I do a lot of damage with melee
---
Title is supposed to say ID card but my phone autocorrected
---
If your on Xbox I'll buy it from you, or trade.
---
Wait you get atoms for being subscribed to Fo1st because I haven't gotten any and I've been subscribed for at least 2 months
---
This is why I run X-01. All the plans for all the mods can always be found at MODUS. Even those mods you mentioned are only about 5k caps
---
What??? I did it as level 25~??? What r u struggling with
---
That's just the first picture you've taken. Pictures are used for loading screens. You're all good brother.
---
Oof that's embarrassing. The assaultron and then the sentrybot at the end.
---
He was at Cranberry Glade. Good luck if you want to find one, I've seen dozens of tamable pets and that was the first time I've ever seen a dog. And of course he gets lost. :&lt;
---
The loading screen just shows pictures that you take while playing the game. That first one you take is just to introduce you to that mechanic. As you take more pictures they will show up as loading screens randomly as well, but that first one will not update to show current level
---
posts to say they're cheating. The smart ones are smart enough to keep their mouth shut and not show off.
---
There’s a non-manual crit?
---
I press it at least 3 times when that happens
---
I can help can you DM me your name I am level 72 or 73 I just have to do it torromorw
---
Thanks bro, I’m on Xbox but I recently got a PC with game pass. I’m gonna do a new play through on there so if you don’t mind hold on to those for me lol
---
I'm guessing probably the assultron and the end boss sentinel. I remember struggling with them (especially since the sentinel was 3 star legendary).
---
Shhh don’t be to happy about it or they’ll take it away.
---
I agree but I was already on YouTube and noticed it had been posted. I was curious so I checked it out. Looks like a lot of fun.
---
I actually completed it and the second you do they move the goalpost.  Suddenly it's 76,000 for 10 atoms.
---
I am still working on that. Almost halfway there now.
---
I've got an explosive based grenade/shotgun non PA tank with investments in serendipity, dodgy, nerd rage, mysterious savior,  born survivor. 
---
It's pretty fun aggroing everything to get a nice big pool up knowing I'd be safe if i took a good group of ghouls.
---
Okay now we’re talkin lol
---
The ID card picture is just a picture. Any photo you take with a camera or in Photo mode will rotate in as a loading screen until you delete it.
---
That's the beauty of having almost no transparency with the playerbase. You can change something people don't like on a whim and pretend it's been planned all along.
---
Oh I thought you meant people had gotten to 100 properly without cheating.
---
LEGENDARY TENDERIZERS
---
How?
---
Hopefully he'll turn up soon! And thank you!
---
Yeah this is why I unistalled it, I'll come back when there's new content but I'm not going to play it like it's a job
---
Is anyone else's stash box just so insanely laggy?
---
I mean its no that hard right... like by now u probably have good weapons and good amount of perks u could stealth kill the assaultron and then just constantly hide and heal with the sentry... have u tried hide and heal(works most of the time)
---
Very cool! Reminds me of Skyrim and that cave of bandits just under Whiterun, I think?
---
Vats crit with a shotgun bröther. Each pellet counts as a hit.
---
Nah it’s simple,yet elegant
---
I gave up on doors. I just use curtains around the doors these days.
---
With the sentrybot, my strategy was to keep circling the building until it overheated. Then I would shoot at it a few times until it reactivated. Then I just rinse and repeat. The main downside is you gotta make sure to bring plenty of ammo - at least 500+ and a couple of spare weapons. I remember I was down to 1/3 weapons towards the end (the other two broke).
---
*Edit for nesting*
---
I'm not sure why you're being downvoted.
---
Do people *like* so-called, "AAA studios" putting out games with meme-tier levels of jank?  
---
We should all be wishing for Bethesda's games to have Rockstar/Nintendo/Capcom levels of polish.
---
I legitimately don’t believe that you’ve played fallout 76 for 316 days. But I could be wrong I guess (if you have picture proof).
---
I haven't tried in a bit but the last time I tried I did hide/heal and it was not successful lol
---
Question for you! I recently tried bloodied because I finally rounded out my uny and for the SCORE XP gains. I had nerd rage 3, but only blocker 1 and serendipity 2. Charred ghouls were one-shotting me every time. Any suggestions for adding survivability?
---
Then you should keep going.
---
If you mean the Uncle Sam salute it was made a freebie by mistake and taken away retroactively.
---
If they did I hope they wouldn't lock it behind a nuke launch.  I dont feel like merging thru a wall or walking thru that buggy ass silo to start yet another mission.  Isnt that how the new event is spose to be started?
---
MidRoad is right.Don't worry about the loading screen
---
Oh word? That's whack. They also removed the invite to team emote. But thanks for letting me know
---
I'm sorry - I would help but I gotta take care of some chores outside before the sun sets in an hour. That's what I get for procrastinating.
---
Yeah, I hate the BOS, but it would make sense that they'd do the Faction Rep stuff again. Unless they do Faction Wars where you can't play up both sides?
---
I'm sure they're looking further down the road. I've thought from the beginning that they've got to be doing something with some of the locked buildings around. The Whitesprings Golf Club resort buildings for example. Every time I walk along the porches, the game staggers just a little when I go past the locked keypad doors. Add more Enclave stuff there.
---
One wasteland will solve this in the fall apparently. Anyone in area will get credit for kills plus the loot.
---
Try again, bring nades, stims, AMMO, and chems ig??? I didnt use any tho
---
That sounds hauntingly familiar. No worries!
---
Most mods on heavy guns and heavy melee weapons (super sledge, sledge etc) add a large amount of weight overall
---
I did mine on the meditation one
---
I've heard it claimed (although it could just as easily be wrong) that Super Duper, instead of creating a second weapon, instead increases the chance of crafting Legendary gear with an additional star.
---
Not big on the chems so I'll have to stock up. Thanks!
---
I too was surprised by how big it was!  I thought it was going to be the same size as the atom shop plushies, but NO THIS THING IS WUMBO SIZED  
---
Which event?
---
I’m just here to say I’m impressed you made it that far, wish people would allow you to be happy, and to give a thank you for all the tips. Seriously, thank you for posting.
---
I use the bow to kill small stuff so I don't waste ammo.  The arrows are easy to craft on the cheap.  I really enjoy it honestly.  My friends just got them game and I've been using the bow a lot with them.
---
Sorry. got wires crossed. The post got removed because playing 81 hours out of 96 is not healthy.
---
Do events in the forest and you.should be able to head up to the toxic valley at 17.
---
It's bullshit, you would need to play for 12.56 hours on average everyday since launch.
---
Equip pharma pharma and farming them will be sooo much easier, i have so many that i have to drop them a lot of the time
---
Can help later if needed
---
I just upgraded to the explosive arrows and I think it's pretty good. You can find the plans at Foundation from the robot vendor
---
I wish sheepsquatch in the wild were so pleasant.
---
The assaultron goes straight to blasting, like no warmup time. At least for me it did. What I ended up doing was getting aggro and then retreating down the hall and making it come to the main level. Then I ran around a beam sneaking shots and basically making it chase me. Since it’s beam is a straight line, running in circles helps lol. 
---
If you’re still stuck by the time I get home I can help. I got a magic shotgun that lets me 2-hit most assaultrons and the sentrybot shouldn’t be too big a deal.
---
Why don't people farm the interior of fissure prime of xp?  You can spawn mobs by picking up the ultracite
---
This is one of the nicest comments I have ever seen on this reddit and it brought a smile to my face.  
---
I really do appreciate it.  Thank you, my friend.
---
I would love to sell precooked food but it just rots so fast
---
The potential extra 500 is lovely, but the biggest thing I'm happy about is that the gold star challenge is still for doing 5 challenges. So if (say) you're struggling to find/kill 3 legendaries you can still get the gold star done today.
---
I run around with a Mutants explosive bow for low/mid level areas and don’t want to waste expensive ammo. They can wreak havoc around mid range vats sometimes doesn’t work but same with the Gauss weapons. All in all it’s never gonna compete with a gun but it’s fun to mess around with.
---
I mean with SCORE I'll be playing roughly forevermore so no rush :)
---
My thoughts exactly, damn!
---
Happy r/spotifycheese day op 😂😂
---
It's basically Ghoul West-Tek these days.  Outside of The Burrows.
---
Think it's probably very easy if you have the Chinese stealth armor, considering silo was a joke with it.
---
Final boss is a bastard tho. 😐
---
Fair point
---
I’m going to leave this here as a cautionary tale and because I deserve to be shamed. 
---
MY PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED. 
---
If you order the game and it comes in a book with the game code inside the book and it’s a higher tier copy and then the base game, make sure you use the code on the vault door paper as opposed to the regular sheet of paper. I spent a year and a half thinking Bethesda fucked something up with the code or the website or launcher or whatever. NOPE!!! It was my own ignorance that was my downfall.
---
I swear there were a LOT more of them before the last patch.  I used to be able to sit there at the end of that main hallway and blow through 20 bullets, and the Ghouls just kept coming.  It feels to me like they nerfed it at some point, or it was a bug producing higher-than-intended numbers.
---
man, i always hope on someone like you at RR. as stealth with csa and mediocre weapons, i dont mind collecting, i quite like it. but either they are all afk or its low levels that get overrun. in fact, i just completed it once. and that time, i did nothing for it bc it was the first time playing it. just ran around like a headless chicken with no clue what to do :D
---
I guess that is better than my Teddy Bear event where we try to find and give over as many teddy bears as possible.
---
Right, but not dying makes the build much more enticing. If there was a real penalty for dying, less people would use it
---
I'm guessing 1%, same as fasnacht
---
I think a lot of my problem is that my most powerful weapon is a shotgun so I'm seeing a lot of rubber banding or boomeranging or whatever it's called.
---
Thank you :)
---
Fr this happens pretty often to me
---
I just learned you can do double doorways wallpaper both sides and change them to solid walls.
---
It seemed for me that NE was what was doing it. I stopped playing NW, and it hasn't happened since.
---
Thanks.  I don't know why the poster opted for a horrible video over a list of images, but there's a few interesting items in there.
---
Funny story. I was probably level 100 at the time and I came across a level 4 player, I gave the hello emote and he just gave me the angry face emote so I walked away wondering what his problem was then he shoots me with his pipe pistol. I turn around thinking it was a mistake but then he shoots me again so I blow him into the sky with my bloodied scattered .50 cal. 
---
But yeah newbies are either jumpy or bold
---
I'll have to craft the armor. Thanks for the suggestion
---
Do you already halve the mole rat teeth you need for the gauntlet mod?
---
I mean, I'm definitely the exception and not the rule in regards to how majority of the player base plays the game, but yeah!  You can get pretty far just doing the daily challenges and a bit of grinding here and there as long as you're smart about it.  Work smarter, not harder!  
---
Honestly, it's too early in the season to be all stressed out about not making it to the end in time.  And it's mostly just cosmetics that majority of players won't even use or will use for a few days before they replace them with ones from the atom store.
---
Odd as the armored version DOES decrease when weapons have mods in it.
---
Can't tell if you're joking or not
---
That's already what they've been doing for years, which is the very reason why so many things don't work like they should/like how you would expect. Every time they need to make an obtrusive workaround to add something simple, they face that choice of whether it would be better worth putting those resources towards a new engine instead of keeping this one on life support
---
BOB ROSS STOP GRINDING AND GET BACK TO PAINTING
---
Is it on Steam? For some reason steam charged me subscription 1 day before the actual expiry date. Thus the atoms come the day after that.
---
Feel free to add me for if you need anything - Remizee
---
Tell me more.
---
And that's no doubt the intent
---
Sometimes for whatever reason it takes a week for me to get my atoms after I've been charged
---
That's a must have anyways...it's really overpowered. 😊
---
Just give us a free fast travel point when we get allied and id be fine.
---
I enjoy the mindless grind and slow progression, so it was mostly fun for me.  But yeah, if you absolutely hate it then I would advise against this.  It's always better to do activities you enjoy than it is to knowingly punish yourself
---
reverse for me. i would be bored if i had nothing to grind
---
It is called ranting sorry that went over your head
---
That is another really cool camp idea. Thank you friend!
---
&gt; No more Responder uniforms or Asylum outfits. 
---
Yes, unless that's how *you* want to roll on that particular day!
---
Not arguing that beth is good or anything but dude have you been playing gtao? Cause i have and game feels like a job, running 10 businesses at the same time to optimize your earnings just so you can buy a car you will drive for 10 minutes and then never touch it again, or buy some flying vehicles so you can farm a bit faster. Even playing with friends means creating a solo lobby so you can grind without griefers.
---
dont grind or play something else. easy
---
That’s as far as I got. They would first have to flag all the bears so they wouldn’t be scrapped instantly.
---
If they would just let your perks affect items in your stash it would solve it. I'd throw on good with salt and wouldnt have to worry about it.
---
The character select shows the level 1 ID photo you took, and does not update it. It's fine and you have not lost any progress. 
---
Mine are all missing except the most recent character because I had to reinstall the game at one point (I'm on PC, there might be a way for me to put them back, but I haven't looked) and it lost all my photos. Luckily I backed them up just before the reinstall.
---
I just do a bash or use some trash gun I picked up to get a tag on it, gotta get that scrip you know.
---
No, its on Xbox. I hadn't played for a couple weeks and my fo1st expired and I just renewed it today.
---
For now just sell the foods that don’t spoil
---
That... Is both impressive and disturbing at the same time.
---
35?
---
And you’re complaining?
---
I read different sides of this even after the latest pts update.
---
If points are account wide,it would srely be faster to power level a new character to 50  for example and get about 10 perk packs;instead of levelling your lvl500+ toon.
---
I think OP problem is that he wants all the cosmetic things, but doesn't want to have to grind for it. In the end there is nothing he, or any of us, can do to change the way the game is at its core. If I felt the way he did, I wouldn't come here to complain, I would just play another game.
---
I’m all for a Mothman event. But not a festival.
---
Something more gruesome
---
Jesus Christ... does it STILL need to be said that outside of just doing your dailies you don't NEED to actually grind anything?
---
I get it that when  the season JUST started we had idiots rushing in here with "the math" about how  you'd have to run through West Tek grinding super mutants hundreds of times just to get enough exp from the repeatable to barely reach 100 before the end of the season... 
---
But for fuck sake since then people have figured out that you get all of that exp just playing the fucking game, or that you don't even have to worry a bout that exp thanks to the two (so far) planned bonus weekends, or that you REALLY don't have to worry about any of that because bethesda has even started throwing in extra weekly and daily challenges.
---
There's too many people still freaking out about the concept of potentially missing out on high rank shit when in all liklihood they're going to hit rank 100 with weeks to spare at this rate.
---
The slots are account wide, but coins and ranking up the perks is per-character.
---
Add Dodgy under your AGI perks. With Unyielding giving such high AP, you can survive a few extra seconds to take out the ghouls.
---
I know it well
---
That could be it... I haven't logged onto NW in probably almost a year.
---
Agree, 10mm smg is an underrated weapon, super fun to use.
---
There is no extra weekly, no. The weeklies still add up to 7500 SCORE. You just *have* to play NW to get it this week.
---
yea there is a cap, its called server wipe. Rust is a true waste of time. You can play that game for 4k hours and have nothing to show for it. You will always log in naked on the beach.
---
Thank you! Although I think I am done grinding for a photo frame.
---
It does not
---
That's because they apply an effect that directly affects all weapons. It's a "perk" that applies to the character after all other calculations are done. Legendary effects are treated as attachments, and on weapons/armor they are essentially just an additive (subtractive, whatever) force to the weight since multiplicative is not possible. The armor effect of reducing ___ weight just directly applies a perk to your character, which IS capable of multiplication. There is no way they can have it affect a single weapon, since the way it works now is via keywords and there is no way in the engine to distinguish for example one laser rifle from another other than the attachments they have. Items do not have a unique ID assigned to them, otherwise we wouldn't have all the embarrassing problems related to duping, items disappearing, etc that we've had in the past two years. 
---
The only possibility I see is for them to create a "perk" that reduces the weight of all items with the weightless "attachment" by 90%, and have weightless items give you that perk instead of having a flat reduction to their own stats. Either they haven't thought of that or, more likely, there is some other issue related to that, namely that it wouldn't provide the bonus unless it was equipped
---
Log out and restart your system.
---
Bloodied are only popular because people don’t know how to play anything else. I’ve done bloodied, and honestly prefer my junkie. Much easier upkeep, and a lot more fun. Not to mention I can lay down more damage than I did as a bloody.
---
Its one of those things that everyone tolerates and becomes used to. Beth has never really addressed it probably because they are unable to. Sorry friend, I feel ya.
---
Hmmm... maybe it’s an event to cheer up a sad robot? I got no ideas.
---
Do you really think a Mothman Festival with the cult wouldn’t involve gruesomeness?
---
No mutations used on my character yet (only level 28). It seems to be random as to how long i can use vats... Even with full AP.. Then it just stops working after a while and i  have to exit out.
---
What you describe reminds me of the Goliaths in Borderlands 2.  They were basically these enemies that would become increasingly enraged (faster, more HP, more damaging) the longer they were left alive.  If you could get one up to the highest tier, it would drop amazing loot.
---
The idea doesn't quite work as well in Fallout, because unless you're inside, you have so much space to work with that it's impossible to create a high-pressure situation like the Goliaths did.  But it was an attractive gameplay mechanic from a risk-reward standpoint.
---
Its been a constant complaint for about a year. Beth has said its on their radar but no concrete updates.
---
And I am so upset because today was the first day I ever had the challenges "Auto-complete" for me and I received no SCORE for any of todays challenges ..Boo Hoo....
---
I believe by the end of week 2 you should need to be around 32/33. Calculated by the total cost vs time remaining.  
---
However if we get more score per day then it'll be easier to catch up from here on out.
---
The word festival is too happy.
---
Did you renew via your xbox or on beth.net?
---
I don't see why it wouldn't just be an entrance to a bunker that's placed anywhere a CAMP can currently be placed.
---
Its on their radar.
---
Also you can’t nuke that area of the game.
---
Sleep before going out and adventuring and check weapon and armor conditions before leaving as well.  :) if you need some early help gt is ju1c3itup.
---
Btw if you're on ps4 and want to team up just say, think I need to do something in a group for season anyway 😊
---
depends on how far from the safe zone it is.. if it has a lot of ground to cover, it will move faster than if it only needs to move 10 (units)
---
Yeah outfits don’t matter but you should be wearing unyielding armor to maximize how much xp you gain
---
Shrouded on Wood Armor remains broken (probably because they forgot it exists and/or is different from Shadowed on everything else).
---
Shadowed on everything else works now, by his tests.
---
canned food seems to be the only option these days with how fast food spoils
---
Have that but only 1 pt. Might try out dodgy 3 then
---
What, "new things" are you seeing here?  Daily quests?  Season passes?
---
Learn
---
Go into game settings and turn Pacifist ON. 
---
Don’t pick player owned locks. 
---
Stash your junk regularly.
---
Probably the endurance buff is pushing your health over 20% thus dropping your Unyielding buff down.
---
Thanks, I’ll remember to do that. Appreciate it, I’ll message you if I need help thanks again
---
Whelp, that was my one shot. Sorry I couldn't help.
---
For that one just go outside of the ring. You can work on the stay out of the ring challenge at the same time.
---
You don't need to unlock everything and some people love grinding stuff out, look at people with multiple maxed out characters on OSRS. I think Bethesda has added too many grinds, but I think long ass ones for cosmetics are good. One of my favorite features of MMOs.
---
Not everyone plays for the same reason. I work 12 hour shifts and finding ways to absolutely maximize my 2 hours of play time a night has been a blast.
---
Same for me. I have an open farm on my camp. with all the needed items for making vegetable starch
---
Thanks, is the community generally quite chill? Or would I have to worry about constant attacks if I wasn’t in pacifist mode?
---
Ah I wish. I'm PC.
---
Ah I see, another sheep to Bethesda. Well listen bucko. Unless you're grinding the battle pass too you have nothing to say. Otherwise you're grinding just like he or she is. Even if you're only hopping on to do dailies then get off, you still did the grind. And you still put your time into it. Now when people complain about a games grind, it's usually because the devs don't actually play the game they make and don't understand how hard it is to grind especially for the higher levels. Not to mention that the amount of score that you'll need for each place on the board will get progressivly harder to get. Sure you CAN do the dailies and weeklies but Bethesda doesn't understand that alot of us players have played the beta, already have been grinding for nearly two years now and havent really got anything to show for it except levels youve aquired. This battlepass will be extremely easy for low levels to do simply because they get more xp than let's say oh idk people over 100? Now. I'm guessing you're probably not a high level or I could be mistaken but whether you are or not. It's still already a grind in that game to get the things you need not to mention even harder to trade or buy or sell from people because trading leads to scams, and no one has caps to barter with except low levels because they are an extreme minority and didn't have to deal with the great fallout depression (when everyone opened presents all the time and were always maxed out and only wanted a trade which like I said before, often leads to scams)
---
You enjoy seeing old bugs pop up? So if you suddenly get stuck inside your PA frame with no way of getting out, or all the valuables in your stash are listed in your vending machine for pennies without you knowing, or your best legendary gets scrapped while you're trying to scrap a minigun for steel, that'll be fine and dandy? Allowing things like that to stand should never be encouraged
---
Not really. Some of them just make you do extra steps in the quest if you don't pass them but you don't miss anything. I deliberately failed them on one of my toons to see what happened.
---
I restarted and it didn't help
---
More than once I've found a bush and tried to hide in it only to find that someone has had taken that spot already 😂
---
do the 4 tunnels. that's definitely enough for rank 1 rewards. Hopefully in that time some scavs survive. And then just stay near the one that's on the middle raised bit. If you have friendly fire in charisma use that (get a shishkebab) and just protect one. And then with about 90 seconds left. Try and get 2 more tunnels and that should give you rank 2. ASSUMING others are not getting ore.
---
Oh and use glow sight. even 1 point is 20% extra damage.
---
I feel bad for you, you should go get your atoms if you're being honest
---
I don’t consider the wipe a cap in the same limiting sense fo76 has.
---
The community is 95% good people. But to be honest, it pays to be safe and Pacifist means a stray shot won’t ‘damage’ the other player. It doesn’t actually do any damage, but it lets them counterattack at full damage, and then you’re both able to attack at full damage. 
---
But if you see someone shooting the ground, look at the ground. They probably dropped something for you.
---
1650 every month...
---
900 atoms
---
Learn it. Then when you inevitably end up with a duplicate, sell it.
---
i have made it a tradition to stand in front of the lighthouse and summon the mothman while my minions gather the supplies
---
Unless it's like 20 atoms a month I haven't gotten any atoms the only atoms I get are ones I bought or from completing challenges. But thanks for the support 😔
---
Welcome to Appalachia, new Wastelander!
---
Enjoy the ride.
---
Scrap everything to learn mods/build up scrap to build with when you have more than you need, the scrap can be easily stored or bulked to be sold. When you want to clean the vendors out of caps, remember that junk also commonly gives at least a cap for one item, and junk is everyyywhere. If you’re feeling adventurous, travel to an event, maybe pick up a couple of daily/weekly challenges.
---
No most PvPers just died out or switched to PvE like me but remember everytime you claim a workshop other people can contest it and kill you just be cautious when claiming.
---
How did you do that!
---
Rough. Then maybe it happens once every several hours like the Lighthouse event.
---
Lol ever heard of Skyrim?
---
*Todd Howard has joined the chat*
---
I'm an east coast boy I'll probably be on then Kpj420 is my gt I can help
---
All mmos are grinds not all rpgs are a grind, but the fact still remains that there is more grinding than actually content in the game currently
---
its not exactly the same, but if you think about if I put in 4k hours of fallout and 4 k hours of rust, I'll have wayyyyy more to show for my time played.
---
Best practice is learn all plans you don’t know, sell or give away plans that are known. You may not need everything you learn, but better to learn in case you might want it later.
---
Glad to hear it, thanks for the tip.
---
In layman's terms, this means we're COMPLETELY FUCKED. Our best and brightest will be led into hell's fiery asshole by these metal death balls. 
---
The only saving grace is this COLOSSAL FUCK-UP is I won't be here when shit hits the fan. I'm getting my wife and kid the hell out of here. Maybe I'll apply for one of those vaults I've heard about.
---
Each consecutive death should stack a X certain debuff for Y or unless revived by someone with specific perk in charisma.
---
Be it slower movement, dMG reduction or "you receive X more DMG for Y*
---
Thanks, I only just loaded up the game, are materials used in the same way as in fallout 4?
---
For the one you wanna buy, go to the market pages.
---
Rad ant supplied will be tricky, but the best place to get ant meat is Tea Time, Thunder Mountain Substation near Watoga (deathclaw spawns and night kill em all, just server hop)
---
Look on another subreddit. This one doesn’t allow bartering posts.
---
1/ LOVE THE CAMP - use of the natural space is fantastic.
---
2/ One of mine (my main) is right across that road - I'm at the graveyard above the cave. And yeah, sometimes those Scorchbeasts wreck my camp while I'm away but then again, it's also like an XP and legendary dispenser ... so ...
---
Maybe the cultists are trying to set off a nuke to summon the Mothman. Once they do, the area becomes nuked, not as big as a player nuke. And the Mothman mutates into a giant legendary one.
---
All of mine were completed but one where it was already done basically
---
it must be that along with some weird rounding error. Also I thought  the "low health" qualification was percent based?
---
When adrenaline perk worked, I never really knew if I'd one shot so I'd give a quick bash and call it a day til someone else killed them.
---
Had no idea people could contest, thanks for the help
---
If its not worth the grind then dont do it, i only plan to get to 39 for that cute plush
---
Ill be back in full force when the BoS storyline comes out
---
Armco Ammo machine is the worst purchase I have made so far
---
Today I woke up and decided I wont be doing it any more. What is the point again ? Round and round same missions, nothing random or exciting. The grind wheel has to stop. This game has started to depress me lol.
---
Vf, vr
---
Approx Level 30-32 by end of day.
---
One of mine is by an assault spawn point. Guaranteed fight every time you fast travel back. 
---
I'm never moving it either. Love the spot for that character. I'll just deal with repair costs. Small price to pay compared to the warm feeling you get when you come back to your camp, hear all the turrets (that are still working) blasting away at a sheepsquatch while your settler wanderer spins up a minigun she's taken from some dead super mutants to toss some lead into said sheepsquatch.
---
Repair costs are high, but totally worth it.
---
That could work. Also not as irradiated as a player nuke. Could be worked around with a simple Rad-X or Radshield.
---
No problem. I have only a little experience with Fallout 4, but I want to say yes. It’s not uncommon to hear Fallout 76 referred to as a standalone Fallout 4 expansion/mod.
---
Power fist or dcg
---
Cheftron: WHERE’S THE SHEEPSQUATCH SAUCE?!
---
I've played for 250+ hours, not as many as some, not as few as others.
---
In my PERSONAL opinion, it's a good game. Well worth the $15 I paid for the tricentennial edition 12 months after launch. I have recommended it to other people, in good conscience, and some haven't enjoyed it as I have, and some have enjoyed it more so. I PERSONALLY admire Bethesda for sticking with it and somewhat trying.
---
 I do however PERSONALLY think that they have gone wrong along the way, yes the launch was a clusterfuck, but it takes alot less effort to just move on a from a game you don't like than it does to take to Reddit and try to drum up a shit storm.
---
I feel the same way about the radium and gamma rifles. Didn't the children of Atom create those to bless others with the mighty glow of Atom?
---
But whatever, FO76 should have taken place in a different time if you asked me. Many lore inconsistencies now. Could have had more factions too.
---
And what new projects have they worked on recently? F76 is pretty groundbreaking for bethesda, as it's a new genre with a new audience for them. Making it was a risk and even though they have done a piss-poor job of sustaining it, they've at least been adding large amounts of content to the game and fixing *some* of its issues. IIRC rockstar's latest game has been RDR2, and I could be wrong about this since I don't play it, but it seems like red read online more or less died out due to a lack of support or updates. Last time I heard anything about it was about some massive skin duping exploit last year.
---
Whatever, main point is both companies suck but it's not fair to target skyrim when bethesda is at least doing other things. They have starfield and TES 6 coming up in the next few years, with fallout 5 somewhere off in the distance. ^^^Doom ^^^eternal ^^^was ^^^kind ^^^of ^^^cool ^^too. Skyrim ports are not the primary focus of the studio. Rockstar has...nothing except the port, seemingly
---
Why not? How about explain why you think this isn't a great idea beyond downvoting and just saying 'No?'
---
Sometimes the wallpaper tab isnt there on windows and doors, try chging it back to a wall, applying the wallpaper then replacing it as a window/door again
---
Considering energy weapons can't be silenced and the fixer is literally the best stealth weapon in the game... I don't really know
---
PA Bloodied gets Protocols + Field Surgeon
---
I didn’t downvote, I’m just disagreeing with you.
---
Too many things in this game are all reward, no risk.
---
I have a quad tesla rifle with an automatic receiver. I use it to tag while rifleman perks are active. A full 60 round mag will barely trigger mutation, I only switch back to the one shot kill semi auto if I'm in danger.
---
I built a house with the double side concept, both floors.  You just need to sequence your build but I wanted some color outside and inside.  It takes up more budget of course, but for this house I did that in mind
---
Just add me on and ill team up with you if i see you. Gt narmyknight
---
Legendary weapons? Grind to even find enemies that are legendary but especially for 3star enemies and it's still a gamble on whether or not you're gonna get a good weapon that you're looking for. Then the amount of script you get per day is a joke in it of itself. So please. Tell me how it is NEVER a grind. I would really like to know. Just a warning though. I will back up my arguments.
---
Bloody bear arm
---
Okay cool, hopefully it should be easy for me to get used to thanks, see you out in the wasteland!
---
Probably b2525 fixer. With be I personally die way too much as it takes just for you to be a little too close to the weapon blast to be obliterated and also I’m not positive but I’m pretty sure the explosive perk gives you away while sneaking from what I’ve read and what I have tested myself. Also dps overall fixer does more, there is a website that will test this and shows you the stats but I forgot what it was called
---
My very first roll on the shotgun I got a 2 star bloodied I love it. But since then I tried a couple more times and it was all junk. Just gotta be lucky, like the best drop slash roll of the guass mini I got was a two shot 3 star
---
Oh yeah, I'm just BSing for the heck of it. I sometimes play a masochistic game of devil's advocate trying to come up with realistic reason for Beth's decisions.
---
The Mole Miner Gauntlet.
---
It's just visually oversized and preposterous, and I love it.
---
The new Gauntlet was a missed opportunity - they should have let you hold it out like the Industrial Hand it's so clearly based on from New Vegas and have it function as a V. Fast spinning weapon.
---
It definitely was/is?
---
[Heres the post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/hm3f2d/legendary_run_score_rundown_guide/)
---
Yeah. But maybe enough to mutate some of the cultists? It could have some kind of effect on creature and plants in the area. Maybe some of the plants become dangerous, as a hazard to avoid in the fight.
---
Thank you so much
---
It's one of the photo-mode poses, although I have no idea what this one is called.
---
Oh yea the maniquinns and dead bodys can do some weird funny shit
---
Yeah for 250...not cool.
---
Yeah I only have a be laser but the only drawbacks are the range and it can be a little noise
---
You guys all rock, glad to see this community seems to be pretty active and helpful!
---
Honestly believe adding this SCORE instead if content has further ruined the future of fallout 76. This is it guys... This is the end game for seasons. This is Bethesda's idea of content. Its really sad. So much lore wasted on a grind circle.
---
Yes. Just add each other as friends and one of you will be able to join the other if there is room in the server.
---
Idk man. Even with my trash bloodies build i can tank all 3 of them  if i have some stims on me (which i dont usally need bc im in 20 percent heath and even purified Walter ist enough to heal me back up). And even if i die, i geht 30s on the clock to kill the boss
---
Thank you! +Karma
---
Sure, maybe a few less people. But like I said, you die so rarely anyway it wouldn't matter if there was a harsher penalty. The high DPS and synergies with perks, mutations, and Unyielding armor are so good it would almost certainly still outweigh any reasonable death penalty. Either death would have to be so harsh that it would make everyone pissed or the penalty would have only a minor effect on discouraging Bloodied builds. A death penalty alone is not the solution to diversifying builds since it wouldn't do anything to change the fact that Bloodied builds are objectively the strongest builds and DPS is the only thing thats needed to complete the vast majority of quests/events.
---
If you really think that a harsher death penalty would dissuade players from using Bloody builds than I would encourage you to actually try an optimized Bloodied build and see if you feel the same way.
---
*equips clown outfit*
---
Ooo i want
---
Nice joke, we all know the plans for that thing are a myth.
---
I get pissed at this too, I have gone to the event and have failed because I was only one that would play instrument. I get it you wanna get the legendary but seriously let’s have some team work. Just like with the last queen fight. Everyone fought everything other then the queen and I pull my junkie mini and get it to the last sliver of health and she flys to the sky with 15 seconds left.... event failed. Smh
---
Yeah me too 🤔 Maybe it's Xbox?
---
If you aren't already, since XP isn't shared even in teams you really want to tag as many mobs as possible.
---
And of course, if you can tag and not kill them, someone else gets xp too.
---
You actually have to *earn* the Legendary perk plus the Jetpack, though. 
---
And it's not like using it makes you invincible or something. You still can't shoot, Your movement speed slows down to a crawl, It's useless indoors and you're vulnerable to getting shot while using it in open areas.
---
This is so true, can't get the tune outta my head. My character's bed is on the floor above near the vending machine below. So every time she sleeps the vending machine goes off. Sad thing is I can hear it when I go to sleep IRL. 😌
---
Going to get lots of down votes. This has been asked over a dozen times.
---
Indeed
---
Correct!
---
Used to be the meat hook before it got patched. Right now, 3 star mole  miner...
---
There are 24 people allowed on each server.
---
You haven't finished Fallout 4?! Do you have the DLC? It's going to be so fun!
---
Sounds like a useless legendary perk to me
---
Go to options, turn pacifist mode on.
---
if u refer to low health bar it is not necessary bloodied. 
---
I go with 2shot weapons but with a mutation that has the same effect as bloodied. +20%  damage due a perkcard while ur health below 20%. If u use PA instead of unyielding armor u can use a module that reduce ur income damage 50% so that makes u very hard to kill for mobs. So actually there is not big difference between full health bar and low health bar speaking of income damage and it is huge difference in outcome damage so most players go with low health.
---
Keep in mind the chart is now definitely "wrong" and should be used as an average instead.
---
Ok. I ask because on the fallout 76 build builder/planner it says you can’t reset your special. I know you can’t reset it all to 1 but you can move them around?  Is it either a perk card or moving a point around or can you do both? And you get 49 special points?
---
So I normally climb onto a high surface and shoot so I don’t have that problem but as I have seen from the comments a b2525 fixer is better
---
I believe there's a rather unique aspect to daguerre's quests that can be lost without the skill check, but I don't know for sure if there is any way to get it other than passing it. It's also one of the highest ones, I think 12 or 14 luck
---
I found 3 in the Monster Mash event at Watoga High School. Great source of Legendaries and XP too!
---
This would be less about creating a high-pressure situation than creating ANY sort of pressure.  Legendary enemies in this game are essentially glorified pinata versions of normal mobs, they should at least put up more of a fight than their non-legendary counterparts beyond their health regen spike.
---
Thanks for taking the time to actually read and comment though, I don't know what is up peoples butts that this got nuked without anyone even taking the time to whine about how they don't want it to be harder to kill an enemy that might drop their god rolled gear.
---
I dig it. But if the event gets too complicated, not enough people will do it unless it has very good rewards.
---
That is why when I vendor hop I only carry a roll of toilet paper and some raw fertilizer on me.  I can only hope they get the point.
---
Yea me too. Head is also a big large and the body is a bit large. Otherwise pretty nice
---
It always moves in relation to the positions of the old and new safe zones. It will always take the exact same amount of time to move from one to the other, so whether it has to move 20 meters or 200 meters will determine whether it goes at one speed or 10x that speed
---
Yes they increased the amount of score points you can get daily
---
There goes my idea of having to ride unicycles during it
---
Nah sounds like typical anti-white propaganda
---
So I assume yes? Lol thanks for warning
---
Power fist and deathclaw gauntlet
---
Can either pick a new perk card or switch over one point for each level past 50
---
Well for the weekly you need like 25 crits, by the time I  realized you could manually Crit, I had 19 non manual ones
---
Doesn’t pacifist mode still let me get murdered?
---
You will never appeal to peoples moral integrity when its easier to cheat than play the game. The exploits need to be patched from on high quickly and quietly. That is the only way cheating will get locked down
---
Its the "rush" of survival.
---
Must have realized that zora moves way quicker than us and will almost definitely win on every single person's board
---
Ok. Thank you for the info!
---
Some people like grindy games, others like games that aren't grindy. There are plenty of both kinds out there. Something for everyone.
---
I got some bloody knuckles, around 650 a slap, which is decent for a rifleman. Sometimes it's fun to run around and bop jaws
---
Nope. You cant do any damage to others, therefore you can't initiate pvp.
---
Trap houses can still kill you.
---
What do you mean?
---
"Thanks for this video. We see the $GotoSeaon button bug at the bottom of the screen and will ensure we fix this. This evidence will now self-destruct in 3... 2... 1..."  /s
---
really? thats quite odd. Every acid one ive used has stopped at 10
---
It's decent, but overall just not good compared to the alternatives. Back on the beat has low level ghouls, so they'll probably die from a single hit of anything
---
To quote Angry Turtle "De ballistic Gutsy is tough".
---
I would pay for it lmao
---
Np.
---
It’s the same amount of daily challenges minus the gold star and nw challenge? Was this added in the last 2 hours?
---
I think you might’ve just accidentally activated it, it’s the same button as jump. Happens to me all the time
---
it happens. I rmb i hit a guy one time so he would move from vending machine and then he killed me while i browsed and took my stuff then instantly logged off. No fun when its like that. My point is that people move sus. It is what is it is. Thankfully most ppl in this game play for fun and like seeing other ppl enjoy it too
---
Oh I see. It’s still just really annoying i and others have to do that because people take advantage of the pvp system.
---
&gt; Almost halfway there now.
---
That should probably have given away that it's a joke, 38000 hours isn't exactly a reachable goal right now
---
im dead, you know.
---
Not even mentioning legendary's, but even regular corpses disappear on me all the time. Usually its when I am hunting for meat to cook. Radstags and other pack animals that run when attacked are the worst. I have to backtrack and find them and I often lose one or two. Its really annoying that they don't stand out more against the backgrounds.
---
I just run emergency protocols which adds to the tankiness. Besides, stabilized is the best perk for heavies but it requires power armor.
---
I know months ago my wife and I had our challenges completed a few times by going to the atom shop before logging in and also from nw before logging in or after.
---
Go to atomic shop, then icons
---
I have been doing this plus if monster mash comes up . Lvl 62 charred ghouls have some good exp and monster mash is a constant stream .
---
AWOL armaments  and encrypted not as good like I n the sand or monster mash . Will hit them up too if they come up
---
Yeah I have been playing for around 100 hours across all my characters so I’m glad this is the only negative experience I’ve had since the game first became playable for me.
---
I get actual stress from NW, and pvp in general. It's why I generally don't do pvp at all in any game. I only sit in a bush in NW, and it Still stresses me out.
---
Agreed!
---
With your headspace, may I suggest single player adventures?  
---
Any mmo with status and level of characters has to include some kind of "work" to the grind, otherwise what's even the achievement?  
---
I haven't picked up any mmorpg since old school Runescape because I feel similar to you, it's a busy life and I just want to escape into an adventure.  FO4 survival mode is giving me those hundreds of hours of escape.  
---
I feel like online games now serve as an essential time sink for kids with way too much time on their hands.  If you can get your mind away from "must have/do/achieve everything", and just jump on to have an adventure with friends, you may have a much more fun time of it.  Leaderboards and achieving top of everything is needless bullshit.  You make a game fun or a chore by how you go into it.
---
FOMO been a thing since Everquest lol it nothing new
---
What new are the service game and you going to get to a point where you stop caring about fomo
---
The last time I ran a bloodied build, I found it made a HUGE difference.
---
Don’t forget that the gauss shotgun can benefit from those “magic” effects, and deal ridiculously high damage in vats. If you get any of these prefixes, try them out before scrapping them: instigating, junkies, bashing, 33% vats, or increased limb damage.
---
Instigating dcg. I have yet to get a legendary for any other unarmed weapon.
---
Of its a pause and they bring back atom challenges, I hope they leave access to this season up so we can purchase any final levels with the free atoms.
---
Funny you should mention it. My first run was with no DLC. This time around I've got it all. 😊
---
Who knows. I don’t really jump much though. Certainly not 19 times in 2 days
---
I'm so excited for you! I'm starting my first survival playthrough right now!
---
That one was still showing up for atoms pretty recently. Wouldn’t surprise me if it shows up for SCORE
---
And also. If you mean level 50 as in player levels then that's relatively easy. But if you're talking about 50 in the BP then that shows that YOU GRINDED for that. Don't be coming in here being a hypocrite. But if you're taking player levels then I'd expect anyone to reach that within a week just by doing the main quest and wastelanders quest. That's easy. The BP grind is a completely different story
---
Wrong sub,Bub
---
Sometimes this happens to me and if I aim, go to third person and aim again, it fixes it.
---
That's great!
---
Dude! Thank you for this awesome insight! Worked for me.
---
I glad you got to experience the best part of this game.  Experienced players helping out newcomers. The community is great. Im sure you will pay if forward one day as well
---
I probably won't get a duplicate. They only spawn from some Cranberry Bog events. I'm a low level, so I'll probably die a million times (i got the plan from a gift near the Overseer's Stash near The Wayward)
---
My atoms usually come in a day or so after the actual renewal charge itself. Don't worry they will deposit to you
---
GTA V has pay to win mechanics... But Fallout is a money grabbing mess??  GTA V, specifically online is the perfect example to defend Fallout 76.
---
Yes, just being in NW stresses me out. Hell even if i go AFK i get stressed out.
---
The plan is over the top difficult to get.
---
NOICE
---
Niiiiice! The original one I got is such crap. 😂
---
Yeah but imagine what makes the mothman cultists happy tho
---
Try a different sub. This one doesn’t allow bartering posts.
---
Thanks guys ill wait until tomorrow or so to see what goes on with my atoms
---
Well that makes sense. I was under the assumption that the NW weekly challenge was strictly related to completing 3 NW (SCORE) daily challenges. My bad!
---
A possible fix for this issue for you u/kihweh
---
Go to the directory that the game is installed on, for example: X:\\Program Files\\ModifiableWindowsApps\\Fallout 76 or search file explorer for "Project76.ini"
---
Copy the Project76.ini file go to your "my games" folder on your windows drive, usually located in the documents folder
---
C:\\Users(username)\\OneDrive\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout 76
---
Paste the file into this folder then right click on the file and change it to read only.
---
Enlightenment from Bethesda. Never would've guessed.
---
Thats a good idea and most will have heavy weapons already equipped.  In my case a bloodied gatling and bloodied plasma gatling ready to go.
---
I plan on it. Considering getting a headset to talk to people too. I usually never do because most social interactions are really tiring for me, but I've found myself actually wanting to speak with others on here which has surprised me.
---
Nice! I queued up by myself. Maybe I'll try squading up next time now that I know how it works.
---
