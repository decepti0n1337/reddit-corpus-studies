well im mainly a solo player but i find ways to enjoy myself and yeah some of them still do
---
---
---
I love it! I too build very detailed and unique camps. I have one I built into the steel frame of a power pylon ( large electric tower ). Took almost 14 hours and still I have people ask " you took 14 hours to build a camp??" I'm like ya! Just getting things aligned and take 4+ hours in it's own just to get a structure to fit into an existing structure. They don't get it. I've built ships, round buildings, curved walls, restored blown out houses, and more. It takes work and knowledge on how to glitch the engine. I can totally see the effort you put into this. So you should definitely be proud of what you've built!
---
Nice one! Do you want visitors? I'm on PC. :)
---
There's always old school inventory and bookkeeping
---
I can help, I‚Äôll send you a ps request.  Will need a few others, I can‚Äôt do insane damage like some people.
---
And it sucks with assaultrons because if they get close you are  f u c k e d.
---
my psn: Owl_No
---
They work as intended. :)
---
Uufff! Yeah, that's pretty sexy. I'm a little bit jealous. :)
---
actually they shoudnt. the whole joke is they were actually pretty useless as in other fallout games you often find skeletons in them.
---
Shotguns are for crippling. Not for killing real enemies anymore.
---
Removed due to rule 6. Ok? Lol. You guys must be bored.
---
Ok Ill give it a look thank you.
---
Thats what i use them for. The problem lies when I have to kill something I can two shot them with most of the other shotguns where this one takes 10 or more.
---
If u keep me updated, next time I see graham I can buy and sell it to u for the same price. I run into him about once a month or so. Xbox
---
you could also have the play option: 'for fun' or 'for caps'.
---
How did you get the enclave tag by your name?
---
Why not just infinite stash weight fallout first players already have the scrap box just merge the two I know they've said hardware limitations but that's bs because the scrap box has infinite weight
---
Really? Damn I am going to have to bring these into a battle n
---
I remember the first time my location was nuked in game and I saw the PPS and immediately hopped in all smug like. Moments later smugness gave way to total laughter as I realized why they always have corpses in them!
---
supposedly theyll be changing it from a pistol to a actual blunderbuss and maybe adding it the list afterwards but its just speculation based on data miners
---
That's called a food build
---
I‚Äôve had that too
---
I‚Äôm well over 1000 hours in and plan to try this next opportunity.  It‚Äôs so obvious I‚Äôm not sure why this isn‚Äôt common knowledge.
---
They didn't have notes on them.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Pulowski_Preservation_shelter
---
Got it. Thanks for the info... also, someone earlier told me that since I was deep into melee perks, instead of respecing I should just start a new character. You seem knowledgeable , so what‚Äôs your take?
---
Cool! The rare cultist variant.
---
they only do 20% of the shotguns damage, it was 100% before the "nerf".
---

---
you can get around it by using the demolition expert perk card, lvl 4 is all you really need.
---
How did you fix it
---
just checked again, none of the vendors have it 
---
i did notice that they sell metal building set cheaper than the train station vendor, but screw that 
---
i want my signs and letters
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool , good job üëç
---
I hate missing the name of someone that bought something.  Many times if I am at camp, I give little stuff to all my buyers  (like saying thank u) and wanted to do the same especially for a buyer of one of my legendaries.
---
Thanks
---
there's no clear indication that it works even when it does. There's delay, no audio queue, the actual explosive seems unreliable at best. Outside SBs and the one quest it's basically 100% useless so I'm not shocked at all. I was hundreds of hours in before I saw someone mention it in a thread and tried it out myself.
---
Power plant one has been bugged for a bit now.  Just have to hold on til it‚Äôs fixed.
---
But technically not in sales anymore.....
---
Replaced PS4 standard in bedroom with the new pro once download finished. It's been unstable for weeks, especially raids
---
It looks sorta like there was just a meltdown or something
---
My group has plans to run it tomorrow night. Probably around 8pm est. If you want to join my psn is raiyl_mist.
---
What system?
---
PC
---
Nice build.
---
That depends on your level, your current perk loadout, and what you find more appealing. Either way you go about it, you're looking at a grind. Which sounds less dull to you: grinding respec XP or grinding a new alt to 60-ish (keeping in mind you'll need to redo quests and the like)?
---
If you're not too highly leveled (around 100ish) and you don't have too many points to move,  I'd probably respec. If you're 150+ and need to move 15-20 points, I'd probably create an alt. Ultimately,  it's a personal preference thing.
---
No Gods No Masters
---
This is awesome I was hunting scorchbeast by the fissure In watoga today trying to get them to land and couldn't wish I would have known sooner thank you. Dude mini nuke bait?
---
Fuck that, FIX EXISTING BUGS BEFORE ADDING NEW CONTENT
---
I stopped playing months ago though, so idk why I even care. I just would like to play that fucking game without raging at bugs or having all my quest progress lost because my connection was interrupted for half a second
---
Hmm. I‚Äôm lvl 90 with an estimated , looking at your load out , 40 points to move.
---
They better not monetize them goddamnit! I want more things to unlock via gameplay.
---
Nothing has changed?
---
Pioneer scouts, BIV/brewing/player vending/ nuclear winter/ burrows/ lying Lowe /etc etc
---
I logged in and caught him walking by hemlock holes maintenance. But he has to be in the workshop build area to count. I was standing in the workshop, he was in the other side of the fence and it doesn't count.
---
Ya, it bugs me he doesn't look more humanoid in appearance.  More like the statue at point pleasant.
---
Had to abandon chasing that badge
---
Why are you asking people who stopped playing?
---
Or 2 player Pipboy games.
---
Mismanagement and/or incompetence and/or greed.
---
Yes, 5 caps per screw. They usually sell out within minutes of me restocking.
---
Communist aggressor detected
---
I can help PSN: YGB_Phycho
---
Regretful but I must tell you this has been disproven many times. I have also tried myself so can verify personally. However IMO it should work like this.
---
A good example of building on existing buildings is that wooden shack with a banjo near Vault 76, which is a great spot for your first C.A.M.P.!
---
Do u personally think I should?
---
Lying low can be knocked out in a few hours, Pioneer scouts  and BIV can be nocked out in a week or two, the burrows doesn't even take an hour to clear out, player vending isn't exactly something you actively go out and have fun wit, brewing is only good for melee builds, and nuclear winter is a just a hackers paradise of a joke. For people that were actually hoping for substantial content they might as well and play any other game that actually provides the experience they are looking for.
---
What level are you and what's a rough estimate of how many points you'll need to move?
---
I'd make a new character with that much movement. You'll also need to buy commando cards and such, so you're probably looking at 150 or higher to get off the ground. That's a lot of grinding.
---
I kinda agree, a more true to the original descriptions version of Mothman would have been kinda cool, especially since it would feel more creepy disturbung when you spot it.
---
But then again the design itself is still cool and even oddly adorable.
---
I noticed that they took lots of artistic liberties with all of the cryptids, with their design as well as with their lore or lack thereof. (From what I recall especially with the Snallyhaster.)
---
I wonder why.
---
They still manage to make them fit pretty nicely into the universe though, so I'm generally happy with our elusive cryptid friends.
---
Damn Bernie supporters
---
Can‚Äôt wait to drop you bozos at the workshops
---
If you don‚Äôt think that the Enclave are going to get any atom shop content and in-game quests then you really are clueless.
---
It‚Äôs so obvious that the Enclave are going to play a large role in Wastelanders. The evidence is all around. With that, people will get more involved with the Enclave and Bethesda will juice the Enclave lovers for all they can
---
I'd beg to differ. Certainly not disproven and tons and tons of videos suggesting otherwise. Not like much of anything in this game works very well, and there's definitely delay, but at least in the scale of how reliable anything is in fallout, they're night and day for me. Maximum wait time with bait is nowhere near what I've dealt with without it.
---
Agree to disagree. Lying Lowe added quite a bit. That main quest plus all the side quests (ie how to get mounted wendigo plans) adds up to quite a bit and it‚Äôs all quality. Brewing is good for all builds (ballistic Bach is not for melee for example), player vending is something a lot of people enjoy and devote entire characters to, and hacking for NW is only an issue on PC. 
---
All in all, is a good amount of free content for a year. To say ‚Äúnothing has changed‚Äù is just a lie. You may not personally like he content but A LOT has changed since launch.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong. There are things Bethesda has done that could wear patience thin of all but the most loyal Fallout fans, but adding a subscription service to the game just beholds them to provide support for it. There isn‚Äôt a single previous Fallout game that was supported in any way after the day of release except this one. Additionally, there‚Äôs nothing surprising about this subscription service model. It‚Äôs almost identical to the one I was already paying for with Elder Scrolls Online except it‚Äôs two dollars cheaper a month and offers a per year option that‚Äôs even cheaper.
---
My free ammo seems to go instantly.
---
Do you have any power leveling strategies?
---
And not so tasteful :)
---
Very creative.  Very cool.
---
Lmao! I guess lessons learned. 
---
I thank you for sharing this tidbit of useful information, and sacrificing yourself for the better of man kind,  because our survival depends on it.
---
He got the owl mask from the Dev room, prior to the fasnacht event, once the event was active, the owl mask dropped commonly.
---
On the 2nd day of Bugmas, Bethesda gave to me.. 2 headless ghouls and a scorched in a T Pose.
---
My mirelurk king does it to, I just leave the game and rejoin that fixes it always for me but sometimes it takes like 30sec for it to just give up. But if your death claw is scorched then it will always do it
---
Try to get an Unyielding set as early as possible. Level and other perks aren't very important. You're looking to boost your intelligence as high as possible.
---
Charleston Capital Building is my go-to spot for leveling. It spawns a ton of potentially high level ghouls. Bloodied builds hit crazy hard, so even a 1* should give you the stopping power you'll need.
---
[deleted]
---
I feel you, fellow believer! &lt;3
---
Nope. There is also the bear arm, sheep staff, and sheep club
---
He not scorched but leaving the game and coming back fixes it. I‚Äôve had him for a while and he just started doing that.
---
What's the bear arm?
---
I would like them to bring back the exploding power armor statue for my collection.
---
That's pretty much how I feel about all these chickens I've seen the last three days after Thanksgiving...
---
It is an unarmed weapon, the plan is awardered from project paradise. It looks like a bear skull
---
BE for damage
---
TSE for consistency
---
JE for Overall goodness
---
I dont recomend furious for this kind of weapon.
---
Since its not a legacy, it wont cost you an eye right out of your socket, but no matter how you dice it, the cost will be roughly around 20k in a trading subreddit. JE and BE are the most costly, since the TS nerf. Also remember that 5.56 is relevant currency now at days, so start making a habit of saving up on that as well. Most people will accept an offer of 10k caps and 10k 5.56.
---
I saw a chicken today too and had the same thought!
---
Cool, thanks
---
Grahm usually does
---
Oh yeah because ballistic bach's +15% dmg and +15% degredation rate to weapon condition is anything compared to Nukashines +100% unarmed damage. Hell even the random  fast travel is a more ientertaining effect than anything the other drinks provide. As for lying low was short and just as forgettable as the base story. Also the wall mounts you gain from it for look good in a home, but that's still not something you go actively have fun with. The games main formula has never changed, you get into fights to loot things, you use the loot to craft gear, weapons, ammo, meds etc., then you take that crafted equipment to go out and fight things. Over all nothing has changed. And if we really want to get petty and call eachother liers maybe you should stop to think all that free content should have been available since the day the game launched.
---
I got mine from the vendor at Sutton train station.
---
Anyone that believes that the reskin was "mistakenly" priced at 500 atoms is beyond naive.  
---
It was listed at 500 atoms because that was it's intended price, it was changed to free because people threw a temper tantrum about how they deserved it for free and on the heels of the even bigger temper tantrum over 1st existing at all it was less of a headache to give the babies their free skin.
---
Someone mentioned playable versions of the unstoppable board game and catch the commie. I think it would be cool to have arcade versions of the pipboy games that save high scores.
---
I‚Äôll join, can donate a card too
---
?
---
You are obsessed with what (you think) others think.
---
I just play a game.
---
What's on who?
---
Ty
---
You have to be directly on zero.
---
Shepard's Crook too, but maybe skip that one so you can get the other's with a higher chance
---
&gt; Take a pic of a player in a nuke zone while naked...
---
I've read that being in power armor can count as being naked.
---
Who cares?  You get the ones you can, you don't get the others.  Sometimes the hard ones are surprisingly easy and the "easy" ones are impossible.
---
atoms, not scrip.  Let's not get confused here.
---
No.
---
IMO you have them in the right order. Bloodied = More Dmg and Higher Cost. Furious is good but Dmg caps at 40%. 2shot packs a punch if your perked right.
---
A little sleeping bag wld be cool you could roll it out and like if u had a sleeping pad as well you could get protection from disease  insulation from the ground and well rested. It could be like a reward for thru hiking the savage divide.
---
That'd be cool but Bethesda is in charge so I doubt it
---
&gt; chess or checkers
---
Blast Radius FTW.
---
I headshot a ghoul in the Asylum and it disappeared. Then down the hall I kept seeing this headless ghoul run across the hallway, disappear and do it again. Was pretty horrifying but a fitting location for it lol
---
Just bought Fallout 1st and don't even played more than 20hrs in the last 365 days - You guys just mad üôèüèª
---
I want to see community challenges that have an impact on the game.
---
Responders sympathizers need to kill scorched enemies.
---
Raider sympathizers need to kill supermutant enemies. 
---
The faction with the most kills in 2 weeks gets a player hub in either the forest or savage divide. Things like this would be awesome.
---
I like carnivore but it's nice to be able to just grab some crops and eat them too. If you're on PC I can make you some serums
---
Definitely want that power armor, but I actually want it a bit less after hearing from dataminers that it talks like Liberty Prime, except in Chinese. 
---
Well, maybe it'll be less annoying if I can't understand it.
---
So they lied. Doesn't change the original point.
---
Bethesda. Can we please... PLEASE. Get a finished game?
---
Yep
---
Found this out the hard way after I was forced to switch to the digital version after my PS4 broke and stopped taking discs in
---
You could easily break 4 if you had too much in the various inventories. I know, I've done it. 
---
Every item has x amount of data applied to it, it's just scrap, and I do mean scrap, not junk, has the least amount of data. To give you an idea, a piece of aluminum has 3 lines, what it is, aluminum, it's weight and it's quantity. A piece of junk would have, what it is, it's components it breaks down to, a line for each of those and it's weight. A weapon would have a line for each modification done to it, so it's weight, it's condition, a line for every mod applied to it, so think about all the different factors that affect a weapon, not those listed when inspecting, 
---
Let's just look at damage, there's the base damage, ballistic damage, energy damage, and radiation damage when applicable, is there a legacy for additional damage when aiming, for crit damage, limb damage or incendiary damage, that usually has additional damage over time. How about bloody damage, which jas to be calculated each instance dependant on player's health, junkie's dependant of player's addictions, and so on. There doesn't have to be a value for each the value is 0 but there does have to be one if it has one, whether positive or negative. Also remember some of these can affect weapons weight and condition and durability. 
---
Take into account a weapon can have multiple mods that affect those as well and a single weapon carries a lot of data. And remember that is just damage. 
---
So no. Its not bullshit

No, you dissolve the pills in water and measure out what ratio you would need
---
Bethesda, how about finally fixing and finishing the game?
---
Oooor.... You just measure out half doses like a normal person.
---
I think the 1st is great but I also role-play in the private world with my friends. Right now I'm trying to set up a game in the private world
---
Game is everyone 7 people me I'm the gamemaster and just watching the players.
---
The players all start at level 1 and they have a certain time limit maybe 5 hours to go and level up and do the most they can whoever gets the highest wins.
---
Maybe spice it up and mess with them idk but I enjoy 1st and I. Don't understand why other people don't
---
If u play alone go to a private server and you will not be messed with
---
If u play with friends go to private and mess around with no one to bother you.
---
If you don't like it just don't buy it next time it expires.
---
Thank you, thank you that I'm not the only one. I have been saying this for months and months. No one seems to get it.
---
They cannot be both because they are two different things. Are you slow or something? You do know what the word discount means right? It is not semantics. Items and discounts are not the same thing. How dense are you?
---
Same. I just kinda gave up. Levels mean nothing after 100 anyway.
---
Just because gacha games are even worse, doesn't mean that getting 1st and other Atomic Shop items isn't ALSO whaling.
---
I wish they would actually put out physical versions of some of the games.
---
Really wish I could weild 2 one handed melee weapons thatd look cool holding 2 swords or having a deathclaw gauntlet and a powerfist
---
You never notice how valuable "life giver" is until you unequip it. Ive come out of a lot of situations saved by that little extra health.
---
Not really, assasians is pretty garbage atm haha. 10% dmg is nothing haha. Pvp people will use bloodied or Junkies mainly
---
It makes funny noises in camp.
---
I would have liked something like this in FO4. Sometimes, I discover a location and want a reminder to go back to it.
---
Not sure if there are any mods for this. A custom marker list. Ability to set a description a plus.
---
I can tomorrow.
---
I would think more along the lines of a big Vault Tec experiment. :)
---
How do you go about finding factions to play with? On Xbox if that matters.
---
U can hit a bottle of serum with max card on u ll still get the mutation
---
Ah too bad I'm on PC. I love this event and I have 14 recall cards. (they're my emergency spend when my vending machine is about to take me over 30k caps)
---
That is why this community exists https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout76Factions?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share it allows you to find factions to play with
---
One spawns on the roof of the spa in Berkeley Springs. Don‚Äôt remember the level.
---
I would like to say PC but I honestly can't. It is full of explorers and hackers. Both Xbox And PS4 seem ok
---
Dude if you have cpu with integrated graphics, try to disabke it via device manager before launching the game. Also there's a chance that your power profile in windows screwed up somehow and Windows itself forces game to launch on ipgu.
---
I was hopeful because they said he was going to go through a few stages. 
---
In the end I guess they just meant passive/fleeing or attacking.

---
Why are you so dead set to White Knight for a company that clearly no longer cares about the fan base they had earned over the years with their previous games? I don't owe you any more of an explanation than you owe me, but if you must know  then it's because of the fact this game has a lot of potential to rise out of the dung heap it's currently in. I would love nothing more than for this game to become something that could rival Bethesda's older works. Unlike you however I will not put on the rose tinted glasses and  act like everything is fine. Until this game can actually impress me I am not going to just ignore all the glaring problems that are always rearing their ugly heads.
---
Wow, it looks amazing!
---
Xbox one seems to have the best prices (I only look on xbox, but have seen ps4 players comment on how good we have it)
---
Also we have a pretty dang wide selection of du.ped legendary gear
---
Exactly. Especially with so many random encounter spots it would be nice to keep a few marked.
---
Because THE FREESTATES are thee best. No need to offer them they already know which is obviously Superior, GOD BLESS THE FREESTATES
---
Scrounger is a regular for my characters. Since ammo is sold 1 cap each, those rounds you don't use become caps.
---
PC. Personal Xp. This don't work 10/10 times. Not once. Never. Not sure how other people are getting it to work.
---
Sorry, didn't read NW.
---
Ok?
---
\&gt;using workshops
---
Very curious to see your build if you‚Äôre willing to show. Trying to build my heavy gunner (non PA) to fair well in PvP while learning the ropes with PvP
---
I just want a system in camp where if I have a pump, the crafting system has unlimited water with which to cook rather than : spend 10 minutes clicking the pump, waiting for the animation to finish and clicking again until I have what I think is enough, only to realize I‚Äôve not only not got enough, but have an odd number, have to get at least one more to get rid of all the dirty water. I click it to get an even number, no animation, click again, pump animates mid click. 
---
Given that having a pump and a cooking station essentially means endless boiled water, can we just get the opportunity to take as much boiled water as we want when we leave our camps?
---
Seizing the means of atom production :P
---
Ok capitalist
---
We know its you Liberty Prime, take off the funny glasses and moustache
---
100 atoms per reroll is a cool idea.
---
I miss the feeling of danger. I took my mistress of mistery from 8 to 45 and those days were great. Hiding, hiking, crouching and more hiding. 
---
It was rewarding for some of us.
---
I'm liking it!  Saturday mid-afternoon is tough but I'll do my best to be there!
---
I have my music settings set to default and most radio stations are too low in settings
---
There is a very good reason we find skeletons inside the Pulowski Preservation shelters in Fallout 3 and Fallout 4.
---
Because it's all opinion. There are a lot who do pvp and want that too. It would be solved if they just made a small portion of the map a pvp zone. Also dont complain when you enter a pvp workshop, the 5% pvpers have left, and die. Pve compromises 95% of this game and the strictly pvers want to take the pathetic last 5 lol. I do not agree with what they did to you afterwards though, that's true griefing.
---
It seems to be a respawn glitch type thing. So instead of them being an Ash pile or goo it is just their corspe standing there. I see it relitivly often
---
It's different if people follow u and keep trying to do PvP.
---
Man I'm on xbox we have that exact roll but it wasn't duped as much as the one with 250 drwr. I'd love to get my hands on it, last one I need to have all the commons haha
---
In xbox I'd say it's a be drwa handmade. But you still see a ton of tse gauss and 50cals
---
In the real world... Well... I see your point, but nobody would choose a sword over a machine gun or a grenade launcher.
---
It fluctuates on PS4, you'll find more prevalent month to month. The original #1 dupe was lvl 40 TSE+50DR combat shotgun. Then after the Valentine's Day Dupe massacre, it was a BEFR laser rifle. After they patched up the dupe methods and Exploiters started keeping them closer to their chest, it was the AAERW Gatling plasma. But honestly this is the most varied dupe meta that our system has had. Is it healthy? Nooo, but it's varied
---
Lol you don‚Äôt even got to use them, just wander close enough to be in the vicinity and when I capture it I can drop you. All it takes is someone not paying enough attention
---
On Xbox it‚Äôs the tse drwr gauss
---
The thing is they're not dead, they're still 'alive'.  
---
I've seen corpses t posing or randomly re animating before stopping losing all collision and the lootable body being invisible about 4 feet away
---
Them not working is not a malfunction, it‚Äôs a feature ;)
---
Yeah but when you hit them they regain health right? And the do not move or do anything?
---
Yeah that's dumb, but easily ignored too.
---
Wait a second... "It wasn't the best choice" ... It was Spacer's Choice???
---
Ok yeh entities are out of wack rn
---
Sacrificial machete blade, serrated cutlass dagger and to my knowledge the extra claw deathclaw gauntlet plans, and more probably aren‚Äôt available from scrapping. The plans exist, yeah. But not every mod is available from scrapping.
---
Bloodied lever action is slightly better than Instigating lever action. I know, it makes no sense, but I tried it tons of times.
---
Yeah they, just seem to stand there and do nothing. I find the random melee thing more annoying though
---
While this may or may not help, I would recommend anyone having connection/stuttering  issues to reboot their modem, router, and computer, in this order. Turn console/computer off, unplug (do not simply turn off) the modem/router for 30 seconds. Plug the modem back in, wait for signal. Then plug the router back in and once connected, turn your console/PC back on.
---
I get strange but minor drops in my internet from time to time that unless you're monitoring it, you'd never know it's happening. It will not necessarily disconnect me from anything, but they certainly could. Once I do this, everything is back to normal.
---
Is pay 1800 atoms for the eye patch and 4000 for the power armor skin, very cool üòé. Plz beth make it now
---
It's been debunked several times, which is why you don't see this topic pop up much anymore.
---
Again with this shit? It doesn't work. Period.
---
Nah it's all good I'm doing leatherman or whatever it's called
---
I powered up Poseidon and it worked for me
---
Hello bethesda, I am a fallout first subscriber. I will pay you $20 or 2000 atoms for plushie, plz make it happen.
---
That‚Äôs the Forrest asylum dress
---
I belive that is the forest Asylum outfit and hat with maybe surgical mask
---
Hunters limb damage handmade works better. Standing there with explosive meat in my hand doesn't land SBs
---
Great idea. I have many duplicate cards.
---
Please god no, not atoms
---
Do you give out your gamertag? Love to try it out with my friends sometime!
---
And then any random blows it to pieces?
---
What if the camps name is Hitler's Diner or worse, that would cause some problems.
---
They need to return it to initial release; slap damage, bounties, lock doors and wall off parts of workshop so it's harder to stop stealing.
---
so the weird bit is flamers works with players but not with npcs or defendables, like doing aktos pharma and the npcs you need to defend, hit them with the shishkabab and it will heal them but the flamer dosnt. i thought it was pretty cool, gives me another weapon in my toolkit to try and angle out a support build which means healing players and healing defendables :)
---
For real sprinkle in some quests and fix the game.

how does the rain catcher boil the water? how bout 5 dirty waters instead?
---
Beaten like a Legion slave.
---
Thanks!!!
---
They did reduce the spawn rates of 3 star legendaries but still 90% of the time you get a 1 star reward, after this amount of time and so many "balance" changes i assume this is how they want it.
---
It's sad but true pcs always have to deal with hackers and the like
---
And you're telling me that people can't already do that with letters.
---
Make sure you have animal friend equipped and are hopping the right random encounter locations. Seems like you have mostly the right spot but the albino deathclaw and nest doesn't spawn where a tameable creature does.
---
See you say that but when it was around, it was pretty much a dead format.
---
If it deserved to stick around, it would have.
---
Actually I think it dose activate but if you craft in bulk it. Gets delayed so when I craft ammo I get the activation.  For like 5 more Minutes
---
yeah they need to rebuild that system especially after they nerfed the corresponding perk cards for it
---
I guess their plan (if at all) was to think they'll rebuild the system but the perk cards would be too op then....so they nerfed them already because it's the easier part while completely neglecting the fact that their actual programming departement isn't that fast or even working at rewriting the pet system after all
---
PC will have the friendliest players on average. While there are plenty of friendly &amp; fantastic players on either console, and the trading market there seems to be better, there are a lot more problematic players. This is all based on my observations since beta here on reddit.
---
There are many players on any platform. PC will have the performance/load time edge. If you have people on console that play, you're good. If you're into NW, then console. On PC, it's easy to find players to play with and rare to find any kind of griefing. Possibly more loner players on PC, as console players have better platform tools to assist with friends.
---
If you take your console to different places to play games (relatives, college, hotel, etc) then get it for console. If you play at home the majority of the time and you have a good PC, then PC.
---
Thank you.
---
Is pay 3600 atoms for the gingerbread house if sounds cool üòé.
---
oh my god yes. Enclave Armor would be amazing or hell. power armor.
---
Oh. I don't have first....
---
I just don't bitch and whine when I don't want to pay for something.....
---
Also what fucking scam? How did they scam anyone with Fallout 1st?
---
Dang wish I could help but I'm Ps4
---
Yeah. Tax time is going to be tough
---
There's also been multiple seasonal events, as well as the tadpole quest line. 
---
Also there's the fact that they are exactly on pace with most online game's content schedule. 
---
Smattering of smaller content, then around the 12-15 month mark, sizable DLC
---
Np
---
Grahm walks by every workshop pretty much. Every time I've run in to him it's been at a workshop.
---
Not saying it's likely, but ..
---
We‚Äôre the best and brightest that Vault Tec has to offer. I just built a fusion reactor out of some toasters, some glowing goop I found in the woods, and some recycled pistols. Surely we could finagle something as rudimentary as a rain barrel that squirts water into a boiler.
---
Also the Order of tadpole, and seasonal events. 
---
It's not like they aren't on pace schedule wise with most online games for sizable DLC. 12-15 months is not outrageous.
---
Nah. Don‚Äôt think so. Idk why it would.
---
Wow this is amazing
---
thx
---
yeah as far as I've read here on the subreddit while PC stores the the photos in a separate folder in Documents, according to other people on consoles the game stores them somewhere with the game's files hence the limit of possible saved photos on consoles
---
Well 76 isn't an MMO. 
---
And I don't particularly want 9384747 player created guilds. Who gives a fuck about you and your 2 friends rocking the "YEET" clan tag? I don't. No one does. 
---
What purpose would it serve if 76? That wouldn't be far more effective story telling and more wise than joinable NPC factions.
---
It doesn't unless you build right outside the pro shop and you have turrets.

Learned through lots of scrapping.  I don't know if it was a bug or what......

Nope. Put on probably 40 hours since the lady patch and haven't crashed once.

They will. For $9.99
---
Probably want to ask for a working game first
---
Yeah I thought it always worked that way but I'd relog and everything would still be dead. It seemed like it was on a timer or something. Maybe just script lag server side though.
---
If it isn't the robot chess pieces it's literally unplayable 
---
Same for checkers/Nuka Cola caps
---
I agree with this as long as it‚Äôs a Borderlands style system where you have to pay ingame currency to do it. (Not atoms I‚Äôm talking straight caps)
---
I would suggest that (in addition to allowing us to use Purified water) they should allow us to use Dirty water, too. But, while all the foods/drinks still give us the full benefits (no matter what type of water is used), we should suffer +15 rad damage from boiled water recipes and +30 rads and 10% disease from dirty water recipes.
---
(Also, the disease risk includes the Whoopsies)
---
Most detailed build I've ever seen! It just really fits the game aesthetic esp the exterior. I love how you tied in the existing building. That takes patience .
---
It's a rare spawn. They were all diseased, right? They were quarantined there because they had a virus
---
Thanks, fellow dwellers
---
U forgot to put the AAE90% RW handmade
---
I'd love to just see it as a wallpaper or wall we could win as one plan in events or in the atom shop
---
I love this idea, imagine the conflict for shelter space! Just write in that ZAX upgraded it and make it canon, done deal
---
It dose work, and any booze can go I it to my knowledge
---
any alcohol. someone put in nukashine or something in it at someone‚Äôs house and i saw it. drank it and they locked me in the house until i started my blackout üòÇ
---
Any drink, any.......
---
kinda like that ghoul kid from FO3
---
Couldn‚Äôt do nuka cherry or any tea I‚Äôve tried so far but it‚Äôs take so long to try everything
---
I just want to be able to tell my map marker from my team mates map marker and not travel half way across the map in the wrong direction.
---
Huh. Nobody ever told me. Hundreds of hours in btw and have played it on PS4 as well (where I noticed horrid FPS and far more disconnects/CTD, also where i experienced the singular griefing experience since beta).
---
/shrug
---
I don't play NW however. Well aware of the nightmare that is that mode on this system and stay far, far away.
---
It would be nice to get a skin for every weapon. As an avid gattling plasma userer I'd love to bling mine up
---
If you're so concerned about saving 10-15 caps that you feel the need to switch perks for traveling you've got bigger problems than peek load outs can solve.

Fixer I believe had one it‚Äôs the same as combat rifle , there was a reward for NW that unlocked a pumpkin skin but yes they should release more skins
---
The good old days
---
Yes. This too!
---
I thought you could use it but it's only for the combat rifle even tho they both look almost identical
---
No way Forreal? I assumed so due to them having the same mods as each other , that sucks
---
Ps4 I'd say number one is TSE handmade, TSE combat shotgun, then AAE rw handmade. 
---
 The lasers got duped a lot later on.  The volume of players duping was much higher in TSE days than after the nerf.
---
Yeah, where is that information?
---
Yeah kind of sucks
---
Look up blue printing. Very easy to do.
---
I quit playing when fallout 1st came out, haven't really regretted it. I loved the game, but I don't agree with the direction they've taken it. I may end up checking in with wastelanders to see if it's worth playing again, and I occasionally look at this sub to see what's going on. Besides that, I find it unlikely I'll be back again.
---
Yes please! My little bar in Morgantown is named The Blue Bottle, but you don't know that unless you see the sign out front, and I'd love for people to know it's name when they select it to fast-travel to on the map.
---
I reported your first issue a while ago, Bethesda is still silent on the matter. I now no longer place turrets to protect workstations.
---
Exactly my point. It would be so much easier. Heck i was surprised when i hadn't seen this suggested before.
---
don't
---
Doesn‚Äôt it also count if you‚Äôre in power armor or hazmat suits; since hazmat and power armors remove your outfit and armor pieces?
---
Outer Worlds does this as well.
---
Makes me think Bethesda wouldn't want to be further compared to Obsidian, in that regard... 
---
Regardless, I agree. Caps for Respec = fair and fun
---
bless your heart
---
Absolutely! Something like Breath of the Wild, which lets you mark your map with a variety of custom markers, signifying recourses, interesting locations, or danger!
---
Welcome! Generally you'll meet a lot of nice people in this community, however you will meet your bad apples and debby downers here and there, considering the games wrap, but if you can get over that it's a pretty neat time and unique experience with the right people.
---
Or that ghoul kid in f04 locked in the refridgerator
---
They should just remove levels from legendary weapons entirely. The odds of getting something useful are already astronomical, it would at least be one less point of frustration.
---
You can thank the "insert loud music and or annoying background sound" for that.
---
That's what mute buttons are for.
---
Good idea
---
What‚Äôs your Xbox name so I can visit!
---
It's like those cell phone machines in grocery stores and malls. A machine does all the processing
---
Well done on that, RNG is so hard to accept, hearing other people getting god weapons or at let half decent and usable, when some people, like me, never get anything useful. 
---
The last time I dumped 1000 scrip, I bought some armor then jumped server, rinse and repeat, still garbage. It's as if some people's accounts are locked into some RNG that is harder somehow, I know that's daft but it sure feels like my experience is different from others.
---
Ho Hum üòí
---
I don't disagree. I remember getting a blooded combat shotgun drop a few months ago (had some other relevant perks, can't remember offhand but I assumed it'd be amazing)
---
In short... It was not amazing. Non-legendary all-star bat would do more damage than two shots from that thing (with appropriate shotgun perks, mind you, the bat still did more perk-less), so you can imagine my bloodied-swing speed bat would blow it out of the water. I do imagine that a bloodied-explosive CS would in turn out-dps the bat, but...not positive. Never been that lucky.
---
I still have the shotgun though, just in case we're treated to the buff it deserves.
---
Why did I buy some last night then?
---
I use my mic fairly regularly, but I may be a one-off here!
---
I am always in a party with friends, I assume a lot of people play the game in groups. I‚Äôll talk on the rare occasion I get on the game solo.
---
just give proximity text chat, how hard is it! 
---
I do not speak english that well as it is not my native language, and talking on mic with a dialect no one will understand  is the reason i will never get a mic. Not every one playing is from the UK or US you know!
---
Are they in your power armor or inventory?
---
yup, one of my favorite load screens is the skull tick ...
---
They just dissappear. I have 9 fusion cores and then when I get into power armor I have 8. They are gone
---
PC from what I hear has the most people who talk. From my experience about 3/5 people have a mic.
---
We‚Äôre getting gauss pistols with wastelanders so keep your fingers crossed
---
it's one of my favorite parts but to call it frustrating is an understatement
---
that's not answering my question.
---
Need me some Billy Strings
---
The movie theater.  
---
I can play all day sometimes and not hear anyone speak on PC.  But go to the cinemas and I'm guaranteed to hear someone blab an hour and a half.
---
You can‚Äôt have more than one in a suit so I assume inventory.
---
I don't understand your question. My fusion cores are in my character in the ammo section of the pipboy. I can see 8 and when I get into the power armor and the energy on the screen just go to 7.
---
Got buddies to play with? The game is significantly improved when treated as a medium for social connection over being a game, imo. 
---
Take the slow road, take time to explore and walk around the world they made and don‚Äôt rush through quests. 
---
Look up builds and try to put points into cards that‚Äôll fit your playstyle.
---
Their is one coming out for Christmas a for every armor
---
In my experience, definitely PC. 
---
Most PC players have a headset with a mic and when I played on PS4 hardly anyone used one.
---
My biggest issue is that there is ton of background noise with people who run around with mics on. So I never have my on. On Xbox btw
---
this
---
Fallout 76 is one of the best gaming communities lots of people are friendly and helpful especially to lower levels. One of my recommendations is at the earlier levels try to figure out what you want to be or you will end up like a jack of all trades, who is the master of trades. Don‚Äôt go for all of the weight reduction perks like I did it becomes a crutch and now I literally can‚Äôt move without them. As an example I have over 350 stimpacks and 300 radaway.
---
Oh thats cool hope it is blacked out and not christmas themed.
---
Most people are in parties/dicords/TeamSpeak very rarely I see people using proximity
---
I have nukashine roulette. Two black water brews and 8 nukashines. Currently there have been two unlucky blackout drinkers.
---
It's red green yellow camo that can be put on every type of armor
---
The drops should be instanced to your level and based off of type of enemy and location of map not specifically lvl, since Savage Divide is up to 99+ it should drop proper loot. I'm overall not a fan of this leveling system both for players and enemies.
---
I also know that liberators can spawn there.
---
Be careful what i ask for, my god that sounds awful. Thanks
---
I'm going to get it so i can finally hide all my armor from the trade window
---
Well i really am shy. I hate talking to randoms
---
So ur saying that uranium fever can have level 50? I play on a private server by myself and have yet to come across a level 50 let alone anything higher than a 40 and im a level 177? Is it broken?
---
You type really well
---
Alot of people are going to get it because it can be put on every type so you can hide it from trade window and since most people have some kind of outfit or skin you won't ever see the crazy paint
---
Not xbox, which I'm grateful for.  Unless people are teamed up, emotes do the trick just fine.
---
crashed vertibird. I check the pond too. The other two are the south lookout tower and cranberry glades
---
15
---
Yeah makes sense, i don't run any outfits haven't come across one i actually like yet.
---
It cost money to buy rights to music. Why buy rights when they already own rights to some
---
Have we told them what we want, what we really really want?
---
Also, if I have the Aqua Boy/Girl perk, why do I take radiation damage while collecting water? I can swim in it, but can't get it on my hands?
---
Right there with you. I‚Äôve powered up each of the plants, multiple times, and no such luck. Broken at the moment.
---
You can blueprint ur camp, but i think its not a perfect feature
---
Your experience is very similar to mine. I have an AAE Combat Shotgun, TSE Pump. and a Bloodied Combat Shotgun, and all of them are underwhelming. All of them are my least powerful weapons. It's sad when you would rely upon a bloodied crossbow moreso than a bloodied shotgun.
---
It happens
---
What platform are you on?
---
I agree and who cares how people spend their money its their money, they should be able to play the game how they see fit. So much hate for people they don't even know all because they can't have or choose not to spend it.
---
No what I'm saying is that is what it "should" be but Bethesda has steadily nerfed more and more areas so maybe that's part of the problem.
---
Do you loose all your content, weapons amd characters?
---
No you absolute buffoon
---
Oh sorry thanks for the info much appreciated
---
Nope, i was worried about that too lol
---
BE Laser or handmade on xbox
---
Thanks for the reply
---
Every time you move your camp it saves as a temp blueprint, it even keeps structures separate. 
---
Problem is too many times when I go to place it, it says something is floating even though it didn't say so when I was building. 
---
A quick press of the button and it breaks down to the individual pieces to assemble all over again.
---
Well it‚Äôs free I usually just drop it if I‚Äôm going to give it away.
---
Please don‚Äôt take away my ghoul slayers weapons. I need them for my white springs runs, I hope you understand.
---
Goodluck out there and if you fall while you‚Äôre asleep remember it‚Äôs not a dream!!!
---
We're afraid of the age gap. No one really wants to talk to other outside their age range.
---
I hear people say this about west tek so I keep going back there. I am lucky if I get one legendary in the entire run.

You want to play a game.
---
Lol that‚Äôs awesome.
---
You can put a power armor chassis in a display case.
---
&gt;Ok, I‚Äôd like to exchange my 20k of 5.56 for caps plz
---
Go to the market soon and someone will take you up on that offer in minutes.
---
Robobrains drop them, so farm silos or Sugargrove.
---
So you think serums for 1400 is a fair price?
---
Hell, man, I‚Äôll sell you as many as you want for HALF that price. 
---
Come on by and let‚Äôs make a deal!
---
I think most of the community of fallout games are solo players so it's kinda hard to get us to talk.
---
Same

Nukular prrrotection.
---
Hang out at red rocket mega stop for a while, roleplay or pvp there until he shows up. I see him every couple of hours there.
---
just you. works fine for me.
---
It is better than scorched earth if done properly. Solo on my private world with my toon a few feet away the loot and legendaries are just unbelievable. I sit on top of the juke box and hook every ghoul one shot. It is hard to go to it on a shared world now because of the one shotting and instrument playing idiots who race the game. When I see this now I start playing instruments too and try my damndest to one shot the nightcrawler (which really only yields scrip anyway - usually you get more from "leader of the pack"!). Been succesful a handful of times and drew sweet curses from the same people one shotting and playing instuments. I am just returning the misery they gave me.
---
Shotguns weigh WAY too much for how little damage they do
---
more like the Bethesda Preservation Shelters
---
Protip for next time: before you interact with the launch machines, bring up the recent players list and snap a picture with your phone. If you get DC'd you can usually find someone on the list to rejoin the server.
---
I would very much love a skin that makes the Gauss rifle look a bit like Destiny's linear fusion rifles (think *Sleeper Simulant*) because that's basically what it is. 
---
Voop nation for life.
---
I happen to like my goulslayers gamma gun.
---
Don't one shot ANYTHING. Use a weak ranged weapon. Tesla rifle is good cuz it arcs between multiple foes. Explosive shotgun at long range is good too.
---
That was probably me cuz you were rushing the event.
---
That would be wayyy to cool idk if it's even possible
---
Flags are blowing in opposite directions
---
I have 5 razorgrain and 5 corn for making nukashine
---
Actually just relaized what Maga means so it is appropriate.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
trolls usually do. but we dont give 2  shits. sick to death of idiots hating on fallout 76. they really just have nothing else better to do except hate on it. pathetic. yet to have a problem with it since launch. so have another downvote. 76 is a great game. anti 76'ers unite..
---
Safest way to prevent the "object is floating/needs support" message I've found is to use use as few ground level foundations as possible and never connect stairs to the sides of them. I usually just use one foundation block and plop stairs on top of that leading to the second level where I actually build my camp. If it bothers you that a single staircase supports your massive building you can attach metal pillars to the bottom of the second story to make it look like the building has more support. These metal pillars are at the bottom of the "stairs" tab in the build menu.
---
NW part of the Forest where the mountains are is always snowing.
---
I happens after the area has finished a full nuke run. When you see bots like that you will usually still see nuked flora.
---
It‚Äôll combine with the current adventure mode and you‚Äôll keep what you have now.
---
This is somewhat true.  I am 45 and tend to avoid kids running up to me asking for things.  I'll drop them some ammo or whatever; but only once have I responded with my mic.  Some kid was asking me questions about serums and was super excited that I was selling them; so instead of messaging him I plugged in.  I explained how mutations work and that he needed starched genes/class freak to really use them.  I gave him a bunch of serums and nuka grape; answered all his questions and I was happy to do it.  
---
The next day; the kid wouldn't stop messaging me and trying to team up.  I messaged him saying I was playing solo, but I felt kind of bad that I got him so hyped then didn't want to team up.  
---
I have a 13 year old son who games and even plays 76 with me; but it would be out of line IMO for him to play with a random 45 yr. old.  I wasn't comfortable talking with someone my son's age, I wouldn't be comfortable with him talking with a random old guy/girl.  This transcends the game and applies to most online social interactions.
---
From my understanding - same game mode. But the environments will change. 
---
Will definitely be able to keep character progress.
---
Yes pleaaaaase i like creating new chars but hate having to delete 50 levels of progress to do so
---
So what about people who choose different factions?  Like people who choose raiders vs people who choose settlers, will they have to fight it out? Can they interfere with missions that other players have in different factions?
---
Great that‚Äôs good news, thank you
---
Unlimited scrap storage so far is the only thing of value Fallout 1st has to offer besides the monthly atoms. Haven't seen any Fallout 1st exclusive discounts on anything at all as of yet.
---
I speak 4 languages and somehow am terrible at all of them. I can understand spoken and written English and somewhat write it, despite ton of grammar mistakes and I got vocabulary of average 6 year old. I have never really spoken English and because of my native language my accent is "strong and sharp" and pronouncing English is hard af. That's why i rather Don't speak English.   
---
As it comes to FPS games, I play CSGO and talk a lot in English. "one spawn low", "-50 mid", "rush B" and other typical FPS stuff. You can't compare RPG and FPS that way. Also also, it's RPG, we play it for story and adventure, not for chatting. That's what Skype and discord are for.
---
It isn't whaling by the literal concept of the term. Someone making a moderate purchase of atoms once a month is not whaling. The entire point of the term is to describe those rare massive catches that bring in a lot of money. You know...like a whale.
---
Stick a link to your build up
---
I agree. Turret range needs to be buffed for sure. 
---
Any ranged enemies kill turrets before they can return fire. Really annoying.
---
Take your time; don't rush through the story like I did.  There is a ton to do; but to get the best result from the story just let it happen naturally.  You'll enjoy the 'after game' more if you experience all the little details of the main story.
---
Is there still a problem with stashing items and them disappearing?
---
Mole Miners cap out at level 40.  Got a Vampires swing speed strength death tambo last night, level 35; so bittersweet.
---
Wtf ?! Way to jump to conclusions lmao , I guess you‚Äôve never parked your character for multiple sbq and had so many Legendarys that you cannot scrip then all in one sitting then found an sbq in LFG and joined?
---
Instigating or AA are better.  They both do more damage against ghouls than ghoul slayers.  As do Bloodied, Junkies, and more often than not Furious, Mutants, Berserkers, .... and oddly enough, simple weapons with the right perks.  The Ghoul Slayer, Troubleshooter, and Mutant Slayer weapons are ALL underpowered and as a result useless unless they have secondary FFR or 40%Faster swing.
---
Exactly the case. I'm 23, and dont enjoy the online chats younger kids bring out. They normally ask for stuff, some want easy gains, help power leveling etc. Plus they normally do, like you mentioned, attempt to join you, in your later ingame endeavors. Now while it's not always the case, most of the time it is, and it's a cross platform/game thing. Xbox 360 for example used to be full of extremely social people. Xbox 1, its like walking into a funeral wearing a clown suit, everyone looks away, and keeps to them selves.
---
This is not intended to, in no way apply to those who maybe shy or introverted.
---
That sounds awesome
---
Shotguns could use a boost to range almost more, its practically melee range before the dmg falls off hard
---
That is genius
---
They do seem somewhat pointless. Takes like 3 shots from a rocket turret to kill a mid-level scorched and that's if they don't stand *just* out of range and take shots at the turret. 
---
Some evidence that spotlights can help them target in, but won't do anything to help the lack of distance. 
---
I still have quite a few up, as my CAMP is pretty minimal budget and its at least something...but more aesthetics than anything.
---
When you log in with the second account make sure to go to the social menu first to opt to 'join friend' (your other account) or you will have to go through the loading screen again once you are in the game
---
Calamine lotion puts on da skin or it gets the hose
---
:) the merchants need their mark-up
---
After all, most items we see in stores today cost less than 30% of their retail price to manufacture 
---
Seriously, in game it depends on your Charisma.  Having Hard Bargain lvl.3 and drinking a beer before selling items helps.  Grape Mentats are also good for large purchases
---
If gauss pistol don't get silencer - it will be useless. All pistols without silencer are useless, cause pistols' problem isn't in low damage (plasma pistol have good DPS). 
---
Look, most of auto and semi-auto carbines can be played with sneak build. Handmade, lever, fixer - all of them has silencer and can be easy build with sneak. Let's see at pistols: only 10mm and 45 pipe is good for sneak build, damage perks take agility points (good bye adrenaline and  sneak). All powerful pistols are without silencer - western revolver, plasma pistol.
---
How much carbines types in game? Assault, combat, handmade, fixer, lever, gauss, radium, railway, crossbow, hunting, 10mm SMG, 45 SMG, dragon. Now, how much pistols: 10mm, western revolver, .44 revolver (same western, but weaker), black powder and single action (absolutely useless). Pipe guns, plasma and laser can be carbine and pistol, so I don't include it in list.
---
That's a reason why carbines is most popular weapon in game. Carbines have lots of types - lots of choice! Carbines have 36% AP. Carbines can be played with sneak easy. What have pistols? Ammm... Ah, yeah, cheap ammo (no.).
---
You just completely missed the point of what I was saying, but go ahead and rage on, dude.
---
I think it‚Äôs the price a robot vendor would charge you. If you want more caps, go sell it yourself in your own vendor. It‚Äôs also a lot more fun.
---
To be fair, not all kids act this way in this game.  My kid has learned an 'etiquette' while playing and has plenty of emote interactions with other players.  I've had 'adult' players do similar things and definitely more aggressively.
---
Good to hear it doesn‚Äôt work - so I won‚Äôt waste any time on it.

yup, have uninstalled 5 or 6 times and everytime I come back all my great T-pose and headless/naked enemy models are still there to greet me when I load in
---
I just cancelled my membership a few hours ago, since I'll still have access to resources inside the scrap box until/if I don't decide to renew, and the rollover into the third month won't catch me out if there is nothing included. It's all on Bethesda now. They can either pull out incentives or not.
---
For the second issue, did you have your pipboy light on? Some people might not know this, but having your pipboy light on makes stealth almost impossible.
---
Rifle Gaming even tested them with a nuke in adventure mode and they didn‚Äôt work lol. 
---
If you think something like that would really work, I have some beach front property in the Mohave I can sell you.
---
In asherons call they at one point had chess boards you could play, it was pretty nifty
---
They need to add the ability to change a weapons level. Make it cost caps. It would be a good cap-sink.
---
We don‚Äôt know for sure yet, but they are using the instance technology with it. So each player can interact with the NPCs differently.
---
Gotta be an Aussie.
---
Bethesda probably don't have it entirely figured out either.
---
Ahem, jokes aside, it's a soft-rework of the gameworld with existing locations changing/gaining interiors, being populated by human NPCs and enemies, with the original main quest being somehow uneffected despite the new/additional story canonically taking place a year or so after we leave Vault 76. Areas will somehow be instanced to stop griefers from slaughtering quest NPCs, allowing them to be there for you to save and kill, and some will be on the main world map since Anchor Farm and the Crashed Space Station are going to be faction locations. How will this work? Will it work? Time will tell!
---
Just as long as you‚Äôre not trying to build an unbroken glass window.
---
You would be correct üòÇ
---
Why can‚Äôt I have a level 40 turrets, with explosive ammo, when the game has them in other areas?
---
Also I want wall mounted turrets.
---
I had a discussion with somebody about this here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/du6anj/if_you_exit_and_reenter_power_armor_you_lose_a/
---
Maybe the things we tried there may help you.
---
Heart Of The Enemy Daily drops it often.
---
Good luck! I play a couple days every 2 months and somehow encounter invincible flying scorched and emdless crashes every time try to play more than an hour, here's to hoping you have better luck!
---
I don‚Äôt like wearing a headset all the time. I‚Äôm on Xbox and prefer to talk through my Kinect, when I‚Äôm in parties.
---
Its a matter of were your base is, if it's on a spawn then yes, however it wouldn't make a difference overall as there are tons of spawns there and most you can actually build around
---
Enforcer is so much fun though. Cripple everything. 
---
Shotguns need a perk card that increases their range. 
---
I think shotguns need their own effect. 
---
They need knockback; which would push enemies away from you.
---
Ha ha ha ha ha

Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want

Yup never seen above a level 40 mole minor, which is odd since ghouls, Scorch, and mutants can be up to 68.
---
Thank you this is actually what I meant. I lost already like 10 cores and I just decided to run and use the ones remains and seems after I consumed one it fixed it.
---
Also I was wondering why they run out so fast since I never use PA and seems it's VATs and Jet Pack. I thought the voice for the Liberty Armor was causing that (lol ikr) 
---
But thanks!
---
Need to buff crossbows as well, and add explosive to them.
---
What about in  watoga?
---
Despite what the description says, Ground Pounder actually makes both automatic and non-automatic rifles reload faster and have better hip fire accuracy.
---
Because of the Hunting Rifle nerf (Beth says the change made the weapon more consistent and that it didn't change its DPS, but it clearly made the weapon worse) which made it only have 1 bullet before needing to reload, Ground Pounder makes it fire faster.
---
Can‚Äôt say I recall ever getting a Tesla there.
---
Is Heart of the enemy a quest?
---
AND MAKE IT FREE
---
15? Better wash that mouth out. Lol
---
It‚Äôs a daily quest, where you have to obtain DNA from a scorchbeast and analyze it at Vault Tec University.  It initially kicks off from Fort Defiance from reading the Mission 99-01 stuff.
---
Wastelanders is like The Winds of Winter from GRRM
---
Interesting point. I was certain the initial perks, like the Life Giver and Ironclad are not that useful.
---
The Two-Shot Explosive Railway Rifle will save you more ammo because it has better chances of letting you be able to loot spikes from targets that you kill with it. The BE version deals the most damage.
---
That sounds like a forbidden snacc!
---
I really wish that they did work on scorchbeasts.
---
What yom on im europe
---
Using a shotgun with the Enforcer perk is more reliable.
---
Why does every game assume if it's a shotgun it has to be powerful at close range.
---
Why would they give free atoms?? They want you to pay
---
Zealots Prime LMG, Prime AA Gatling Plasma and Prime Furious Gatling are my SBQ weapons.
---
There is a keycard you need to get, it‚Äôs in the basement.

Although it says workshop, taking a picture of him at a player camp counts. I have done it during one of the meat weeks.

I can‚Äôt make it this time but would be interested in a future event

I started Fallout 76 as stealth pistol build thinking I‚Äôd do my typical smooth talking gunslinger build as I do in all my first Fallout playthroughs. After hitting a couple levels above 50 I started to realize that pistols just aren‚Äôt viable at all, especially out of stealth and VATS. So I ironically switched to a shotgun/explosive build thinking that shotgun shells are cheap and easy to find giving me more bang for the buck per shot. It was fun for awhile but after that explosive nerf, my AAE pump was crippling me more than it was hurting the enemy. Now I‚Äôm almost level 200 and have spent all my level-up points on respecing back into a stealth commando build and I absolutely love it! I use a AAE 10mm SMG and the thing just tears through enemies, plus max caps so after a nice long day of dumping 10mm rounds into mole miners and super mutants I can restock at player vendors without ever breaking a sweat on ammo again. I still kept my AAE pump cause I still use the Enforcer perk card to cripple enemies like glowing ghouls and especially that dang SB Queen when she won‚Äôt freaking land. I just hope they atleast buff explosives in general again cause all these grenades and mini nukes I have laying around need to be put to good use...
---
While they're at it, they should remove all melee weapons, all but one or two ranged weapons, all the low tier armour and PA because they're mostly trash.
---
No, and those affected were compensated. Very well actually. If you were effected you should have been compensated.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but you ain‚Äôt gonna be fucking anything up at level 15. Unless it‚Äôs merely to piggyback off a higher level. Maybe Mr. Farmhands exclusively and a couple mole rats.
---
Nope. Pistols is good for end game - I play with em since start and got 340+ lvl
---
Tell me what you want what you really really want
---
I guess so ,..because I was talking about weight  reduction perks in Strength. As an Heavy Weapons build when I‚Äôm packing 4-5 weapons on top of whatever else I‚Äôm holding when I decide to join an Scorched Earth event. I have to swap to all weight reduction perks  to fast travel and then swap back to heavy weapon perks .I never said anything about 10-15 caps ..can‚Äôt fast travel with when overweight ya know ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Im lvl 223 my age is 25 peasent

Apparently there is a Presidential Gauss Rifle that‚Äôs been datamined

That shit was hilarious. When it first happened everyone was all, "There's no way Bethesda can duly compensate those players."
---
Three weeks later, "Reeeeeeee! That's too much compensation, Bethesda!"

You need to learn how to use Reddit. You said you‚Äôre 15 or level 15. You‚Äôre dumb as fuck. Learn to punctuate better

Loved taming and having a pet at my camp, but it‚Äôs totally not worth the effort , camp budget, and or SPECIAL points needed. Use to be hard to find a tameable pet, but now it feels impossible and if your lucky they won‚Äôt die right away. I have had a death claw, mega sloth and a dog. Both the DC and MS lived a couple of days the dog was killed seconds after I tamed it. Wish they would make it easier and let us keep them around longer. I still keep the cards equipped and some space in my camp budget just in case I want to go looking.
---
They're trash and not worth the budget. They just don't have the range to matter.

Damn man I would've paid 25k for that!

Not really haha. I have no clue what it is. But neatüëç

How about the Possum Challenges "Take a picture of ... " failures.  Half the possum badges are un-earnable at present because none of the "Take a picture of .... " pictures register, and since things like the Deathclaw hide are next to impossible to find, 1/2 of the rest are almost impossible.

Why bother having mods for the backpack if you can't do anything about getting them?

Jeez Preston still being a annoying sleez bag i see

I mean I‚Äôve at multiple times oneshot people at full hp.. even have a video of me getting 15 kills in a game when the weapon came out over on my YouTube.. it‚Äôs not necessarily a ‚Äúgreat‚Äùweapon, just because how it works.. but if your not one  shottin them.. or getting them at least 3/4 health down.. YOUR MISSING YOUR SHOTS Sorry but that‚Äôs factsüòâ 
---
The guns dmg depends where you hit them.. leg less dmg.. head 1 shots.. body 1shot-3/4 health depends on perks bobble heads etc

It‚Äôs also a great weapon to shoot once and switch to a secondary spray weaponü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I wasn't thankfully, I just recently purchased it myself.  Thanks for the info.
---
Would throw off all their perk balance.. PA has its uses in squad play.. but running pa solo would never be a good idea.. 
---
As for melee.. use a full set of melee perks and tell me you don‚Äôt enjoy slashing people from full hp with a hatchet..üòÇ
---
Melee is GREAT! And lots of fun.. but is it the best way to play? No.. of corse not!
---
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt expecting it but I‚Äôm happy. All that flux and the vault 94 steel kinda makes up for the year of crap they put us through.
---
Grahm walks through the AO of the munitions factory at some point in the day.  That's the only workshop I'm 100% sure he visits.  Seen him there multiple times.
---
I saw that one time but i needed wood
---
That‚Äôs a misogynistic band, despise girls.
---
I peaked into the game during the free week in summer, and I didn‚Äôt have this many issues.
---
Granted I only played till about level 10. But besides a disconnect or two and a few frozen/t-posing enemies, there no real game-breaking issues.
---
Most annoying thing was that sometimes enemies would just respawn around me out of the blue, when I thought I had cleared an area‚Ä¶
---
I had a deceased death claw that wouldn‚Äôt stop trying to destroy everything! He was a lot crazy, but a lot of fun! Question I though they took DCs out of the tameable creatures? How have you kept it alive? I have only had two pets they all die with in dayyys! What‚Äôs your secret?
---
Yeah, and if he gets out then gets back in the number drops to 6, that's without removing the 100% one that already in the armor.
---
I think he was being sarcastic, they have to have cruddy weapons to offset the good weapons
---
Enforcer was definitely my only reason for using a shotgun, however I did use one quite a bit for the express reason that it *didn't* kill my targets. 
---
I had rad sponge + charisma to share it and would group with any other players I could find that weren't on a bloodied build, then kneecap everything that moved while letting others deal the real damage and we'd all get the drops.
---
We need Chaly's bathtub from Meatweek. That way you can just have a source of water you can collect without the animation.
---
I meant perks for Nuclear Winter but Thanks :)
---
Bethesda really needs to do a balancing pass on all weapons, they were going to do that with Wastelanders in Nov but got pushed back to Feb. I hope they release the weapon overhaul this month.
---
Oh well if he was being sarcastic.. my sarcastic British mind definitely missed thatüòÇüòÇ
---
Yes the 100% need trash tier weapons to off sett the balance of the Good Weapons! But that‚Äôs the beauty of FO76 NW..
---
Even ‚ÄòMost‚Äô of the trash weapons are overpowered when you assign certain perks to them..
---
Literally every gun but the .44 pistol can win you a round of NW!

Stupid game devs who can't balance shotguns in games.

[Video Game Shotguns](https://www.nerfnow.com/comic/748)
---
The game artists created all sorts of quirky items.  :)
---
This but also that there needs to be gear progression as well. Game wouldn't be anywhere near as interesting if everyone started out with top tier weapons and armour.
---
Finding good gear early is as much of a strategy as good aim and cover.
---
Well it better come soon with more skins
---
So? I can do that with letters anyway.  Plus it's an adult game. 
---
If I wanna name my camp "Big Bob's Big Brown Booty Hole" then I should be able to.
---
I love this sort of CAMP. It feels like the sort of thing that really lives up to Vault 76's stated mission of rebuilding America; this feels like something that someone would want to build and live in, given the opportunity. Comfortable, cluttered and secure.
---
Well you write better than a lot of native English speakers I've seen on here! üòÇ

 Nice to see another Aussie out here in the wasteland. üëç

I'd like to vajazzle my rad rifles

Agreed

All turrets need a range buff and some need a damage buff as well. We also need wall mounted turrets because regular turrets atop walls can‚Äôt shoot straight down.

Actual faction systems are community events, separate rewards, separate perks etc.

The camps I move I make it to be moved. Each one has a single block as a foundation. 
---
Normally they're good until I use the advance power connections. I don't know how I can float something with those. I specifically use the wall pass throughs and keep them planted on the floor. Outside of the small foundation I try to make my camp as realistic as possible.

I prefer booze box üòÇ

Why would you buy steel? You find that practically everywhere. Just scrap the gun you picked up off the npc and boom, steel

Any items price is the base value of the item. A vendor will offer you less than that and sell it for more than that because they need to make a profit. Converting items 1:1 from their base value has never been a thing in bethesda games unless you have a high trading skill, but this game has it set to a higher extreme to limit inflation.
---
camp somewhere less popular and you can get right in
---
Yup
---
When you sell it to a bot, the maximum you can get is 1/4 of its designated in-game value, no matter how much you boost your Charisma and eat rape mentats. Say if a piece of stable flux is worth 100 caps, you can get maximum 25 when you sell yours to the bot.
---
That's crazy I struggle to sell my bullets at that price both 45's and 5.56's for a cap and 50 cal's for 2 caps
---
I am terribly hard of hearing, and usually only use the mic to tell people something, not to ask questions, as I'd never understand the answer. I loved ESO as they had text chat, and I used that a lot.
---
Lol. you're simply wrong.
---
Aw man that would be sick, I'd love to have a sleeper simulant in fallout
---
sell it at the vendor, 4 caps each.  You can't cook with it for the most part and its everywhere.  I usually sell about 50 of them every game session
---
So is that how that high level guy I ran into on PS4 had a scorched beast circling his house without killing him? I‚Äôm new to the game and thought the game glitched
---
Had the danger thing last night from first spawning into watoga, shot at by 2 robots but not the rest, all the way to top floor of emergency services building still danger. Luckily my "backup" weapon is an AAE 10mm smg so had to say screw stealth üòÇ still took out a 3 star wendigo  at top floor with 1 drum mag.
---
Out to the roof still danger. Fast traveled to camp immediately hidden?? Have 2 harder to detect armors and sneak and escape artist perks so almost never detected except with these bugs so agree it's very annoying.
---
They don't even save you from scorchbeasts.
---
Lol i do this and crouch with the chameleon gear. XD just sit there invisible and some one always opens it up, sees the skeleton and dips. Idk if anyone looks hard enough to see the clearish predetor camo of me in there but i usually just casually slide the door shut after they tun off.
---
I've found that it depends on what part of the world, US are more likely to talk than EU players due to lack of language barrier
---
Assuming without PA? Yes, that is very sustainable!
---
that just seems redundant because if you play the game long enough they will become stained in your memory. I just started playing again since stopping for a while before summer and i still remember nearly every location i used to farm in the game
---
Yes without PA....i should have added that
---
Damn son what armor u wearing
---
no its false.
---
It‚Äôs been an ever asked change to make mutants to a %30 buff by giving you plus 3% per mutation.. but as for the assassins change.. I haven‚Äôt herd that one before? 
---
However they are both just rumours either way.. nothings confirmed.
---
I was sad when my dog died the day I found him but Iv had a dc for months now and I think the only way to get rid of him at this point would be to move my camp and I don‚Äôt want to do that.
---
Considering how there are multiple versions in the game, I think the implication is it's not the "real" Mothman but a race of mutated moths that post-bombs Appalachia has accepted as the actual Mothman. Though honestly his design is super cute
---
Damn I wish this game had crossplay, I would love to come to your camp and give it a shot.
---
They nerfed the chance of getting good effects.
---
I think it means he only serves you know-who.
---
Il have to give that a try.... they have a loot all already that's what made me think a craft all could be done lol
---
From what I understand its like of like a No Man's sky situation. You will be able to keep your progress and what you ever you get from the start to when Wastelanders begins but its a soft reboot of the game.
---
I have a few in game friends who I sometimes team up with and that's really nice, but we only use emotes and text chat on our phones. It can get a bit long-winded, but I fear the pressure of having to constantly make small talk or fill the silence whilst playing, or to share a lot of details about my actual life. They are all very lovely and kind people, but even so, when it comes to chatting we might not have anything in common, and then we're stuck having to talk for many hours with an incompatible personality! I don't even like to talk to my actual IRL friends on the phone, and especially not for hours on end! :-)
---
It would be great to use it periodically to achieve something, like launching a nuke etc, or for small encounters with strangers who stop by my camp. But I fear that by switching on my mic I'd set a precedent. Equally it might be amazing, but I am a painful over-thinker (clearly!) who doesn't like endless small talk or awkward situations. :-)
---
N t dodgy
---
I think other concerns are important too, on PC I don't have a lot of the bugs that console players talk about(don't worry there are still some), and while nuclear winter has a good deal of communication on PC it also has hackers, Also if mods ever come PC will be the preferred platform for them.
---
Nothing they spaw regularly.
---
I feel you. I wish map guy was still doing his thing. I would say cross reference the map with all your choices of main spots. Mine is lead. I find it an invaluable resource for a filthy cas' who doesnt RNG legendaries. So i searched up all the nodes and moved tf up away from the great spot i had in whitesprings. Now i hit the issue maybe once in a weeks worth of playing. There arent any "better" locations but i found one in the bog where like almost noone sets up camp and i havent seen a decrease in sales after the move either. I promise theres another spot with the nodes close by you bro
---
what mask is that and where‚Äôd you get it?
---
You won‚Äôt get any plans from raids if you are doing novice difficulty.. However if you are completing the raid on standard and above, you should be rewarded with a plan, every time until you have obtained all plans!
---
Also note, as far as I‚Äôm aware The PA plans only come from expert! Could use clarification here tho? :)
---
Peloski stuff was actually a scam and never actually worked

Ahh ok that‚Äôs a shame. I could probably do standard solo but expert might be pushing it. Thanks for the answer :)

It would be better if you could craft levelled turrets

I moved from the Savage Divide to the Mire a while back and I sadly I did see a noticeable decrease in sales. I had to stop looting because I sell junk and nothing was moving from my stash, and for me, looting is life! I was constantly overencumbered. And lonely. So I quickly had to move in order to carry on playing the way I like. Perhaps people just don't like the Mire, but it's something to be mindful of if moving to a lesser travelled location. If you do move, I'd suggest that you build small (and portable) until you've gauged whether or not you're content with the vending situation, then go for it! I spent ages building my Mire home then found I couldn't place it in my new location.

It could be the shelters protect from the blast, but.. then what?

i just hope it is possible to join factions, so there will be more interaction like events in the form of turf wars and whoever wins, gets to keep the turf - different npcs, vendor sales change etc 
---
or even wars vs super mutants and if super mutants win, then we cannot fast travel to the location anymore until they are wiped

A desert eagle mod to convert a 10mm to. .50 cal would be good.

It my opinion, the rifleman build is superior. I love it. I also think that since you are a beginner, then you really won‚Äôt have much armor. If you don‚Äôt have armor, then these enemies will have no problem with killing you if you chose the melee route. Also, I know that ammo can be a problem and my advice to that would be to only fight enemies when NEEDED to save ammo. And in terms of the long run, I think that if you don‚Äôt want to die constantly, then the rifleman route is best and you can acquire some AMAZING weapons with you chose this route. I have a bloodied explosive handmade rifle and I can kill ANY enemy on the game almost instantly. Melee weapons easily have this power too, put it can be a riskier bet in my opinion. hope this helped!! Ask me if you have any questions
---
For low levels, do a bit of both. You can soften super mutants from afar &amp; then melee them to save ammo.
---
Its pretty hard to be efficient or deadly until your over level 50 &amp; your build may not be finalised until about level 80.
---
Max barbarian, iron fist, blocker, incisor and gladiator in strength. Max tank killer, rifleman, master rifle and expert rifle in perception. Max iron clad in endurance and evasive in agility.
---
Level 180 melee and rifle build here. Works a treat for me against most anything. Get an anti armour rifle ideally handmade and you are golden.

I hate myself now but I love this game and it's fun to play, especially with friends üòê anyway just posting on a here cause I got a notification about trending and wanted to make a joke but it turned into a opinion/speech at the end.. fun
---
Yeah, I'm 100% sure it was a gift and not some dude hitting on my ole lady. First clue was the toon was female. Yeah, I know, that don't mean much in today's society, but I recognized the outfit and makeup from said YouTuber I'm subscribed to. (Also, I'm an old fart, so I'm especially suspicious of most of the douchebags on the internet and MMO's now.. ) But the finality of it was there were not messages afterwards, no friend requests. Nada. Just a complete gift. Yes. it happens.  This helped restore my faith in humanity.
---
You sure? I swear I have seen higher level miners in a nuke, or are you just talking about around the map not at events?
---
Wow Australia?? Will add you and see if we can meet up!
---
And thanks I need it lol. Good luck to you too  either way if we can't get together sure someone else will üòâ
---
Difference in loading time only? Or texture streaming too?
---
It's not the loading times when you log in or fast travel, if you wait here 10 or 20 seconds longer it would not be that bad. The problem is: games like FO76 load stuff all the time.
---
Pretty much any game that must load textures/sound bits/animations/whatever constantly while you move through the world will perform way worse on HD. You can't compensate the differenence in oading speed with a powerful GPU or CPU, they will just idle while they wait for data.
---
Bigger/2nd SSD is no option?
---
Down under yeah. Living the dream. Online most evenings and mostly all day weekends. Have a good one bud.
---
I'm... Well we.. I'm sure... Okay, I have no idea.
---
Online now and keen to do in next few hours. All perked, armoured and weapons up. Let me know if anyone keen to do it. Feels like would me more fun in a team.
---
SmoothHC is psnid
---
I feel nothing..I'm betting someone's typing a hate reply breathing heavily and yelling at the phone just to start drama or a debate on "oh your defending this game! You love their pay to win and demonetization!" Or something like that in after the 7 minute wait to post this reply or during while I'm off reddit doing something else and forgetting to post this reply after 3+ hours or so I'll try to forward it if possible [yep knew it üòó guess I can't even make a joke about anything I suppose even if I have 1st or not this small part applies if someone wrote a reply but if not during the 7 minute wait ignore this bracket]
---
It was a first for me. So stoked at first, until the scrip started dropping.
---
No, plans are random and you can get any plan on Normal. I have whole set of Strangler Heart and I've never finished expert difficulty.
---
You must have a pretty lame relationship if this makes her year
---
Even better idea is you fucking yourself
---
To fit everything for 1 handed melee in strength and rifles in perception right? Would work good idea! I have about the same but only 9 strength with all heavy gunners just for big enemies like sheepsquatch and sbq... perception probably about same as you but alternate all riflemans or all commandos depending on my moodüòÇ
---
Fair enough, thanks for clarifying:)
---
Second SSD is not an option now, because i have no money for it right now. Well thanks anyway, just reinstall some another game to HDD. The Crew 2 for example
---
Boo yaka sha
---
that's MY spot. it's the most homely place I've ever had. but I couldn't fit stuff on top of the tallest building. For a high ground freak like me, it's the best spot I've ever found.
---
that means you need to leave the camp and you'll have a hard time of overencumbered
---
Yeah, I also tried to figure out a hybrid-build. But I found that the relevant perks were too different to squeeze everything together without ending with a bad compromise that does both poorly.
---
Maybe I need to get back to the perk calculator and try again‚Ä¶
---
Not if you have a water source in your camp... which you should.
---
now everyone would wanna build there :( XD
---
Aaaaand the mg42 pleeease
---
Ammo production can be pretty painful at low levels. A good ammo farming route can be summersville, New gad, Charleston fire department for lead weights, and then wade airport. Super Mutants provide gunpowder plus steel from their weapons, and wade airport is good for scrap as well. After the run, saddle over to Charleston station and scrap everything. Takes some time, but good for xp as well. At level 15, save up and get the handmade plans. Hope you've saved up some screws because you'll need a ton of them for crafting/scrapping handmade for the mods.
---
It is a joke bud
---
My camp is currently a power armour garage/mechanic thing on the side of the road, so moving it to a river would kinda ruin it
---
Tbh, I agree, I love using my Civil Unrest shotgun and my 10mm Pistol just to mess about with especially in low level areas you can roleplay slightly 
---
Plus I use them as a back up whenever my 5.56 rounds are running low
---
Black Friday prices, the price will go back up, but probably to about$25-$30 as they now have the sub bringing in revenue. There is a possibility it could go free to play but I don‚Äôt think that will happen any time soon if it ever does.
---
Yeah you can get people to fork out for them that are unaware of the spawn, like the green hood or fasnacht man mask
---
I thought so, but the Crown Royal is telling me Derp de Der tonight...  Sorry boss! LOL.
---
There are plenty of helpfull high Levels out there, but i personally believe that the Player base is in decline due to content stagnation and new games getting released.
---
I'm on PC, if you ever need help with a quest or sth hit me up with a pm :)
---
Yeah the fasnacht man mask for sure is extremely easy to get. I love vendors who have them for 5k+
---
Exactly. Swap out barbarian for 1 of each heavy gunner perk + stabilised and get in PA for sbq otherwise one handed melee and rifleman all the way.
---
Cool
---
LMAAO!! So much this... Yes. Someone popped into my camp while I was in the middle of one violent night and cleaned me out. I lost probably 15k because of it. (Another story entirely...) Anyway, I leave event early to shut down my machines and decide I've GOT to spend some caps. So, I start visiting camps... Being as I was in the middle of an event with ferals trying to eat my face, I didn't see who bought my crap. Yeah, long story short, I ended up buying back a piece of equiptment that he/she had purchased from ME for I THINK 500 caps more than I sold it for. (I have a pretty much pre-set pricing guide for myself...) When I went to the second machine, I noticed like10 of the items I JUST SOLD and put 2 and 2 together. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Never claimed to be intelligent. Hell... Super Mutants are freakin Einsteins compared to me apparently! LOL
---
And it's so dumb it'll often just try to place you on the same server you just rejected, I've noticed this when some background things are the same (like someone's camp near where I am logging in at is there more than once while I try to find a server).  So doubly-dumb.
---
Shotguns were never nerfed.
---
I usually think the chambers are effective but the occupents just died from being locked in for too long, shit doesnt look like it has water, food or a toilet and by the time you try and exit to get what you need you're gonna get a face full of rads and die
---
Yeah that happens to me a lot too. Very doubly-dumb.
---
I dont see a camp i see a pre existing structure that was carefully handcrafted by the devs. /s
---
Forreal tho it looks pretty cool!
---
That is awful wow thanks
---
I don‚Äôt think they allow that anymore, do they?
---
The "Fury"comes well before the "Quiet." 
---
Tell me youre on PS4. LOL! Good to see a veteran gamer on here as well. Well met, my new friend!
---
Wait... what?  You can get heavy guns from Terminals? 
---
Care to explain, pretty please ? :)
---
I don‚Äôt know but I have a whole vendor dedicated to it and it sells! Can‚Äôt keep it stocked!
---
For deathclaw hide the buffed them pretty big time. They are much more common.
---
Damn that's looking good, puts my CAMP to shame, but then again I build for practicality first, aesthetics second.
---
I like that idea
---
It's an ugly beast.
---
Did you try it out?
---
How tf does this get anywhere near qualifying as "cuck"? Sounds to me you may have some repressed fantasies or maybe not so repressed..... No judgement... Okay, not much...
---
As someone who only plays RPGs and shooters it was way out of my comfort zone but I can easily say it's one of best and modt unique games I've ever played. Cannot recommend it enough!
---
that cause it wasn't made by Spacer's Choice
---
You develop a vaccine for the scorched plague in the current main quest which I assume is taken by a majority of the NPCs. The plague was the main problem keeping humans from resettling. The scorched creatures are secondary and can be worked around.
---
Exactly... What is the point of a Person who buys the game after Wastelanders to find the cure if everyone is cured, turn on the Scorged detector that has already been turned on... Help modus nuke the Queen after she has already been nuked?
---
Shotguns IRL are the best you can get for short and medium range, especially for small targets like rabbits or for unarmored humans for self defense, but for big things like a bear or a boar it won't have enough stopping power which you would use slugs or buckshot which are basically single projectile but since new vegas I haven't seen a game with that ammo (ignoring ARMA and war simulators), I just wish that bethesda adds different ammo types for different targets instead of having to juggle different weapons
---
They should do a year 2 server like survival... And you could choose one or the other before loggin in
---
Wow that's even better then, I'm level 84 currently and got a decent set up just grinding for end game stuff and leveling
---
 A level 50 Western Revolver should hit at around 100 with nothing, assuming you are all perked up.
---
This here.  With the way perks unlock based on levels you will have to take some perks you don't actually need for your end game build and swap them out later on.  You could lightly invest into melee cards for a boost now but swap them out later on, or vice versa.
---
 Also as others have mentioned early game you are just going to be squishy. I had the same problem starting out, wanted to go full melee because it was so fun in fo4.  Quickly realized I was going to have to use guns for some enemies unless I wanted to die constantly.  Use melee on anything that you can to save ammo and hopefully pick some up from the corpses. Use a gun when you need to.  Late game either build will be viable on its own though.
---
Just 2 Steel. I‚Äôve got like 8k right now so I‚Äôm good there.
---
Such a cool story! I usually hoard plans (without realising a lot of the time; I passively loot plans and recipes like I'm still a level 10 player), so occasionally I will drop by a low level player and give them away with a few Stimpaks and other bits!
---
On a side note, I had tried working on creating a system to block off vending machines with a garage door and a keypad switch, though the switch didn't seem to function as intended; it didn't require a code to be input whatsoever and could be used with/without a code. Kind of a shame; I don't know if it was because I was on a team (building in someone else's camp) or if it was bugged.
---
I have the weight mod to go with the perks and unyielding armour I have. Insulated would only be useful if you rely on cooked meats for food and bonuses to increase melee damage etc, it‚Äôs useless to someone like me who uses canned dog food.
---
I'm on PS4 yeah at LycanWolfUK 
---
Hopefully you've got the 5 I need for the Atoms lol 
---

Isn‚Äôt the insulated mod the one for energy damage resistance? Sorry if I mixed that up I‚Äôm not in front of the vendor.
---
I've been after one as well - no luck!
---
I‚Äôll try to remember to let you know if I find one
---
Should be refrigeration but now you‚Äôve confused me lol.
---
Thx appreciate it - for Encryptid farming I put a notice on here in advance - you could try that? But   hit me up if you want gt is same as here üëç
---
Or even a recipe to boil purified water into boiled water, it‚Äôs stupid and backwards but it‚Äôd be an easy fix to add a single recipe into the game
---
Cool how do you benefit from lead lined? I‚Äôm a full health character and I rarely venture inside nuke zones as I don‚Äôt like wearing PA.
---
Bro i just asked hard cap of intelligence effect on game
---
That's what she said.
---
But they have perk that reduce your carrying shotgun up to 90%
---
I have 3 shotgun in backpack with vampire and i'm pve immortal.
---
Max damage is with 5 addictions, they are permanent unless you take Addictol so choose chems that suit your build, it's pretty plug and play as well, I just have to avoid getting an extra addiction like alcohol because then I have to take Addictol and start again.
---
THIS, damage isn't bad(when you aren't watching 2/3of your damage heal after each hit) it is the range. Shotguns should hit hard out to 20 or30 "fc"'s. ( F.C,. - a term coined by my buddy in NW, fallout clicks, for the unit of measure the game is using. Like I'm 75 f.c.s  from you). Right now, it IS a melee weapon.
---
My turrets vanish or kill each other :/
---
I see 3 star enemies all the time. I still get 1 and 2 star drops way too often but I will say that I haven't had an empty legendary body in a long time.
---
Read this.

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
I find Lead lined most useful for most of the time and the high cap when I need to carry more.  With full poly Scout armor, mutations and damage mitigation perks DR is less an issue than rads.  I also have the Armored pack but rarely use it.
---
Huh? In the beginning there was TSE shotguns, and they where good, too good., One shot the Queen good. Then came one of the 3 biggest nerfs in the game. Took an enormous amount of damage away( made sense) and an enormous amount of range away ( way to much).
---
Due to the limits on the camp budget, I don't typically use turrets at my camp. Even when I was in Cranberry Bog with 3star Legendary Scorchbeasts spawning almost every time I loaded in.  
---
Sure, things get broken &amp; I have to fix my camp.  But that is pretty much life in the wasteland. At least we don't have to deal with a rush hour commute in game.
---
It adds rad resistance, I avoid using PA as much as possible so I use the Ironclad and Rad Resistant perks as well and my resistances are better than my Excavator but not as good as my X-01 so I wear that when I hit nuked zones currently.
---
Wow, snarky much?
---
I did the picture one by photographing a dead megasloth in a nuke zone whili wearing Excavator PA.
---
Pretty sure you're right. I got the challenge in my Excavator PA.
---
What you looking to do mate?
---
Not yet. My Excavator PA counted as naked.
---
Thanks it was helpful
---
I doubt it's possible to dupe the mask. If you try to drop it it'll just disappear and it won't let you put it into a container or anything. I suspected they may have patched it when it stopped letting me equip it normally
---
Nah
---
They could just add additional wood to the recipe if you don‚Äôt have boiled water in your inventory to cover the difference
---
AA is only viable because it has no downside but the damage increase it provides is not good enough when used with AP perks and mags because of the diminishing marginal return.
---
Junkies on the other hand has no diminishing problems and the negative effects from chems are trivial, with 50% flat damage increase it provides the best continuous damage out of all non bloodied type weapons, while Instigating provides best burst damage.
---
Sadly i am on PC. Cheers mate
---
Just say no! Lol no seriously I haven't bothered trying junkies so can't say it's not worth it or anything but personally I just prefer stealth sniper/ commando and any rifle that's named IE, AAE or FE...
---
Well that would be one of the best ideas you had ever made tbh.
---
You can survive one of the enclave dropped connection blasts in them at the one near the res rocket. I do it all the time. So, they can protect you from somw big blasts!
---
Though the best prices you can get are hard capped with CHA 20, Hard bargain won‚Äôt help any further.
---
Thanks, that‚Äôs good to know, with those 5 addictions do you think I would notice a marked difference between an AAFFR and  a JFFR weapon?
---
I started down the melee route and maxed strength.  The cool thing there is that now I am able to excel at heavy weapons, shotguns and melee and am able to swap around cards to do all 3 whenever I get the urge.  I still have enough perception to do pretty decent with stealth commando as well and use it as my side weapon, though that could be improved quite a bit.  Even with the unoptimized commando, with good gear I can drop most enemies with one shot still.  I say side weapon but I actually mainly use that now lol.
---
Just wish they would roll out the fricken perk loadouts already.  Shotgun does great in silos and the heavy if great for the queen.  It's a mad scramble to get everything swapped around between launch and nuke touchdown.
---
Oh yeah. I missed that the first time around.
---
1st silo run!
---
Jigsaw? Is that you?
---
Jesus Christ, why can't I escape that asshole? 
---
Everywhere I go Billy Strings this , Billy Strings that! 
---
I just don't get it.
---
It's a 50% damage boost so I'd say so, I do ridiculous damage with my auto railway rifle.
---
i had the exact same issue last week and sadly i had to reinstall the game
---
I'd prefer the Spice Girls over more boring bluegrass music
---
Lol. No secret. It is probably just good luck. When I said I‚Äôve had my deathclaw for a while, I just meant like for 1 or 2 months. That is a long time for tameable pets. 
---
Also, I don‚Äôt know if they took deathclaws out of the tameable pets. That would suck if they did.
---
Yeah this has been talked about for a while. I love the idea
---
lol :)
---
I use scout, but I recommend combat. The only reason I switched as I was having no luck finding the combat pieces I wanted.
---
Missing your armor does help a lot with extra damage/energy resistance &amp; then you can add lead lined, deep pocketed etc. Does make the game easier.If you are on xbox &amp; can supply the materials. If I'm online ill mod for free gt aussiex01
---
They'll most likely rewrite the main story a bit since most of it will be weird as is. As for modus and the nukes he doesn't care about the scorch beasts since the enclave after all were the ones who made them.
---
Yep insulated is like armored but for energy resistance. Made a mistake getting that thinking it'd be good for silos right? Wrong. I think those damn invisible assaultrons will still melt anybody in half if not in PA so don't bother lol
---
In my experience , it makes a massive difference. It would definitely be a noticeable and frustrating downgrade to go back to  having it on a HDD vs SSD.
---
Xbox here but my husband had the same issue and after trying everything you've done, we logged him in from my console and it worked. So maybe try signing out of your PS4 account and sign back in, if you don't have access to a second PS4.
---
Nice one mate!
---
Oh that makes more sense lol.  Im still working on my nw level up if youre still on when im done ill help if no one else responded.
---
one of the reasons I stopped bothering to craft/gather water. Like, why the fuck am I taking +10 rads of damage to myself when I CAN SWIM IN THE SHIT?!
---
But in the lore they were just a scam to get money from the poor people right? Pretty fuged up.
---
Thanks guys.
---
I think I will give the melee-brute another try. I just like the idea of running into battle Leeroy Jenkins style with a sledge-hammer‚Ä¶
---
But I will keep a side-rifle for special situations till I am tougher and can just soak up supermutant bullets.
---
Woulndt it make more sense to seperate both worlds?
---
Scout is better when modded
---
Historically, Fallout was a single player RPG. I'd say a fair chunk of the player base want to play 76 that way too. They probably don't want to socialise with others, have anxiety, don't have mics or can't be bothered.
---
Very good point. Biggest differences are:
---
Polymer scout limbs add 40 more dr, but slighlty lower er. Imo damage resistance is more important unless you live in silos, where PA is better anyway...
---
Scout can just go buy polymer mod for each piece and u know it's best it can be and comparable to heavy bos combat armor. And don't need to worry if it's light, sturdy or heavy.
---
Yes please
---
Honestly there's so much Dev time for this versus the use it would get, imo it's really not worth it
---
Cheers mate!! ü§òüèªüòéüç∫
---
Combat becose better stats(heavy) and easier to get mods and plans. Harpers ferry vendor sells heavy and sturdy combat armor plans. You just need to server hop until you get lucky.
---
Here you go, only the diffuse texture is applied to the meshes (no normal, metallic/roughness maps) so it looks weird. I could probably edit the .bgsm materials to fix it but that'd take more time, so for now:

Thankyou for that, another tick in th slippery road to addiction box, I‚Äôve noticed at the moment I‚Äôm addicted to alcohol and buffets which I can understand but I chug radaway like there is no tomorrow can you not be addicted to it?
---
Ha gotta love predictive text.. who‚Äôs not addicted to buffets
---
Have it be like botw was for the switch
---
You definitely need mods they almost double your dr and er, for combat you need BOS mod which you can buy from in game robot vendors, for scout you need polymer mods which you can buy from the enclave! 
---
In terms of which one is best, they both have the same stats except dr and er are flipped. So if you want slightly more er go combat and if you want slightly more dr go scout. Apart from the chest, combat is better for chest
---
RNG is a weird beast
---
Is that the Staines massive DLC?
---
Im playing on PC
---
I dont like Scout armor, because it looks not good for me, im forced to use a outfit then, its cancer for my eyes.
---
I dont find any website that can show me, which mods i can use for for Combat or Scout armor, i just had to make some exploration of these for myself.
---
I dont in need fpr AP refresh (ultraweight) or something but i dont know which good mods there are avaible i might not have discovered yet.
---
Im playing that game since release but im still fairly new with Armors.
---
Hahahahaha! This is brilliant! The music makes it 50% better! Wish you could have that playing in the room as soon as the door closes. :)))
---
I'd say Scout for two reasons:
---
\- it has slightly better DR (Physical) stats when fully polymer modded (265DR vs 226DR for Heavy Combat Armor set)
---
\- it's easier to collect due to no variants (Combat can be heavy, sturdy, light) - if it's good roll you don't have to worry about if it's heavy like with Combat Armor.
---
I know mods are expensive and need to be bought every time you'll get upgrade, but in my experience it's not a big deal - caps are easy enough to get to not worry about it.
---
What's the point in it?
---
I also have a hybrid build.  I sneak unarmed, and maybe not so sneaky heavy and rifle.  It keeps me busy.
---
Doing it solo, or the icon?
---
Maybe not an icon, but something that signifies you have done it would be nice.
---
If there's a reward then more people will try.
---
&gt;Im playing that game since release but im still fairly new with Armors.
---
Yeah, i think, i need to get scout armor for 70% chance, but im also interested  in that bos variant now, from the Combat Armor. Weight is not a problem for me, it doesnt matter if light, medium or heavy armor.
---
What advantaged i get from the BoS Combat Armor,  roughly said?
---
I could say the same for the daily NW challenges I'll never get.
---
Does lead-belly prevent this?
---
Cheers fella. About to log off. Good luck with the levelling up. Am online most nights so if you see me around but me up if interested in silo run. Got my full troubleshooters kit for shits and giggles. Cheers
---
Add on question: Wanting to upgrade HDD.  Anything special other than reloading SW on new drive?  Any other files I need to pull over?
---
Yes! I need to grind to level 500 and this will help. It's a personal thing. I'm level 360 so I can do it!
---
Ive always had hybrid build but the problem is youll just be average and not perfect in any skill which is why recently ive made a badass bloodied sneak rifleman build
---
On the one hand: playable races aren't a new concept by any stretch so you're cut is likely gonna be the right to access the content the same as everyone else.  
---
On the other hand: Why stop at ghouls and mutants? If this lets me play a Protectron, slowly wandering around the Wasteland, unable to equip damned near anything, muttering canned phrases as I shoot ineffectual lasers and club things with my stump guns, then I'm totally on board!  
---
Poor humour aside, I could see that being a potential long term goal, and it would certainly make things unique among all the other Fallout games.
---
Mutation friendly, light weight, perfect for sneak build, which I love.
---
Would it make more sense? I guess. Would it be the best way to do things? I don't think so.
---
I doubt it'll change anything if they've add an icon or any indicator to the user - you're already have shitload of icons and stuff as a reward for V94 finish and I would't said people do raids to get those.
---
What's more, I'll risk a theory that it's impossible to do SBQ solo without Fallout 1st - I play this game for 2000+ hours and never been in the situation that no one appeared when Fissure Prime was nuked.
---
So, I see no point doing this...
---
Just go heavy gunner/2 handed melee. It's harder to keep up with ammo for a heavy gunner but it's so much fun. Plus you can switch to two handed whenever you are running low.
---
The stupid part is that people can drink more than once.
---
Yea alright mate Ill send you an add and see if we can make that happen.  Sorry leveling up in nw takes forever since game wait and load take a long time plus you dont get much points.  I try to do a level up every day so i can get to 100 and wrap that up.  Catch you later for sure.
---
This makes no sense concerning the Queen is much easier to kill solo bc of the fact the more people that join the more damage resistance she gets I got her to half helath one time before people started joining after that she became much harder to kill.
---
AA faster swing speed gauntlet is where it's at. Good chat. Cheers bud
---
Have you tried to power cycle your internets?
---
I've had the danger bug happen a few times now. Spend a few minutes searching the area and constant pressing vats but nothing is found. Finally able to fast travel but still in danger. I probably look strange jumping around the same area while crouching then standing over and over.
---
My turrets have had moments of being hostile towards me but each time they had no health. The first time it happened I repaired the turret but it started shooting me, after that any time it happened I stored it then placed it back. Recently while at a player's camp their turrets needed repaired so I repaired them except one because it was red, that was a first time seeing player turrets hostile without doing anything to cause it.
---
In has an effect on the durability of items that you craft, but has no connection with the rate of mods learned from scrapping.

For scrapping, there's a set chance that you'll learn a mod, with a list of every mod being rated from most common to least common. I don't have the exact rate handy, but, to generate some as an example, it'd look roughly like this:
---
50% chance of mod form list A
---
25% chance of mod from list B
---
10% chance of Mod from list C
---
1% chance of mod from list D.
---
When you scrap a thing, it runs the numbers in order... if you trigger the List !, it looks over the list of mods on that list, grabs one you don't know, then stops. If it fails on list A, then it runs the number on B... hit it, it grabs one from there and stops. Failed? Check against C, and so on.
---
So, when you first start scrapping things, you get a TON of hits because the A list is set to pop up like mad, but it only has, say, six options. When it's all used up, you only get rolls on the less-common charts, so mods come later. If there are 6, 8, then 10 choices on A, B, or C, you'll get through them quickly, slowly, then even slower, while the last list, which has all the remaining mods, takes for*ever* to chew through. A year in, there are *still* some mods for combat armor that I haven't learned, for instance. 
---
It's a really interesting system, but the way it works isn't very intuitive. If you track down some OLD threads, some for the data miners put up the actual charts with the real numbers for how common it is to learn something, but that's been... man. 10 months maybe? It was a WHILE ago.
---
Good on them, also fuck those people saying it was anything other than a nice gesture.
---
Real people play games not just desperados.
---
yep, 3 out of the last 4 days of playing involved multiple instances of freezing with disconnects or straight to home screen.  Each time not only was I killed while the server was frozen but lost all junk.  How do you die while frozen or even when controls are frozen in an area where no enemies spawn or can reach you? Level 226 since beta, Xb1x, gig speed, external storage
---
Yes she is easier to kill, otherwise it would be nearly impossible, but your not relying on other people.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but it made me feel like I achieved something when I did it today
---
They don't have these but factions do this themselves
---
In mine we have the lottery and we play games and makes challenges for you to compete in
---
I understand the fallout 1st part, that's why I invited people who aren't subscribers to pm me if they would like to try it.
---
That particular quest has always confused me because I think it's never explicitly said that he went in before the bombs dropped. IIRC, he said he went in because he heard 'loud explosions', but given how close he is to where two rival factions were popping off, it *could* be that he was already a ghoul when he got into that fridge. Then there's the matter of how a ghoul survived without any sustenance whatsoever for almost 200 years and the odds of his parents actually also being ghouls too and who didn't seem particularly exceedingly excited to find out their boy not only survived the blasts, but also managed to get back to them (if we're going with the theory he was in there before the bombs dropped - they don't seem....*ecstatic* enough, given the premise).
---
She's far to easy to kill solo she loses all that damage resistance fighting her Alone. if I saw someone wearing that icon I would just think that took the easy way of killing her.
---
All god fella. I should try that NW some time. Sounds stressy though. Have a good ine.
---
I need to use a specific Scout armor? The Urban or the Forest for the mods and Modifications i will make? Im searching ingame for some Player, they are offering some Forest parts of that Armor? But i cant attach mods and modifications to them from the Enclave?
---
Greetings
---
You don't understand - BoS is just a mod for Combat Armor, best in case of DR/ER bonus. Same as with Polymer mod for Scout armor. Problem with Combat armor are 3 variants - light, sturdy and heavy which significantly vary with DR/ER - example - CA chest on max level with best mod (BoS) gives you 61DR/61ER, while heavy variant with BoS gives you 86DR/86ER. So the whole set in light variant has no match with whole set of heavy variant in terms of DR/ER (226DR while light only 169DR)
---
It is armor
---
Selling the game is platform to try and entice new players who may spend money in microtransactions, where the real profits come from.  At this point they are just trying to recuperate the cost of the disks that were already made in these sales
---
I have no clue that‚Äôs what someone else told me
---
Probably wasn't too hard to see it since it was the third time that hoke was made in this thread
---
Have you done it?  In a group is a lot easier as you can rely on others.
---
I guess that would depend on the size of the group.
---
Sorry for bringing up a suggestion of something else that not many people in the game have probably tried.
---
Lets just keep doing the same thing  everyday &amp; not ever try to test yourself.
---
I understand - you'll invite them to your private world and allow them to try solo. But I still miss the point in that icon? I'm not convinced it's needed to anything...
---
Your camp location sounds like a pretty good spot. My first camp was just south of Gorge junkyard by the river.  We spent a lot of our early levels running around Morgantown shooting &amp; looting. Hit the airport for Collision Course.  Explore that Forest region as well as up north into the Toxic Valley.  Limit spending any resources repairing weapons at your level.  Just scrap them &amp; pick up new weapons from the scorched you kill.  Go melee if you find yourself low on ammo. Watch for the perk cards that let you search containers especially pharma.  
---
Level 215 on xb1. The wife &amp; I enjoy helping newer players enjoy the game.
---
No you won't be addicted to healing items.
---
Yea no worries.  I just want the unlocks for skins and stuff you get.  Not really for me.  It is tedious and annoying but 30 more levels so progress.
---
I've done it both ways by myself I do around 5-10% of her hp depending on my buffs.
---
With a group it's around 1-2% depending on the amount of people.
---
Solo will always be much easier for my build style.
---
I had the same problem. I sent Bethesda a ticket and they fixed it up pretty quickly. Apparently it is a rare thing? Anyway, good luck with getting back in!
---
That's nice.
---
This post would be a lot different if the title didn't have the last two words in it ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)

I believe it is also a bit lighter.
---
If you did specialise instead of hybrid &amp; have decent gear then you could solo the queen
---
Ah, great ty so much I‚Äôm gonna try and grab a weapon to test, time to down the pills, see you on the other side
---
Yes, prior to the patch, when you relogged, your addictions would be removed. Now you have to use an addictol to get rid of them, or they persist.
---
T√§m√§ selv√§.
---
Are they still selling it? Not sure why I've never seen that. Looks good and this picture reminds me of the Metro games.
---
ah, thanks man!
---
W- wot?
---
Yes, heavy Combat chest with BoS and Dense weight 14.7lbs while Scout Chest with Polymer and Dense 10.5lbs.
---
Okay, FINALLY got it to upload. I apologize for it not being very instructional, I didn't have my headset charged. Hopefully this will give you the basic idea. If you need more pointers let me know and I'll do my very best to help out!!
---
https://youtu.be/kZ7o3Klk-2M
---
Heavy Combat chest with BOS mods and Scout limbs with Polymer mods is the best mix for what you want - reasonable balance between DR and ER with slightly more DR. 
---
If you want a pure set, the Scout chest with Polymer mod has 1 less DR and 31 less ER. By contrast, going full Combat with BOS mods gives 39 less DR and 91 more ER.
---
BOS mod plans for Combat armor can be bought cheaply from the vendor bots in Grafton (may have to server hop to get them). Polymer mods for Scout armor can only be bought from the MODUS terminals in the armory part of the Whitesprings bunker.

It's Japanese.  
---
Basically what he's sayin, or she, is that magazines on displays shouldn't take CAMP space, for obvious reasons. They take space and weight as much as other things.  
---
So he/she's asking to remove such limit.  
---
Posting in japanese doesn't really help to reach out the devs i guess, not to mention that this feedback has been expressed alot of times by the community already.
---
You are legend bro thanks for your time for this info I appreciate it üôè
---
Bethesda makes me want FO76 to go up in flames and cease existing, but user stories are actually warming my heart to the idea of forgiving them and going back to West Virginia one more time.
---
I've been server hopping for days straight and still have not found a legendary tame. Its annoying.
---
I hope folks stick around to the last pic. It‚Äôs pretty epic.
---
They're basically complaining about wonky camp budget stuff to do with displays.

It would be nice if reddit had a translate option.

It's English subreddit, learn English or use translator....

I love everything about this other than the way your bathrobe rides up when you pose like that.

Do the frat party mission if you haven‚Äôt already. If you have, this might still apply. Afterwards you can go back everyday to do a repeatable quest for a recipe reward. I think there are 7 and that they‚Äôre only learnable here.

Keep It Real!
---
I like it
---
My favorite character is a melee psycho buff fiend. Add in mutations and she one-shots just about anything that isn't a sheepsquatch or scorchbeast. She'll never do as much damage as a bloodied build, but she's a great casual character for exploring.
---
Faction wars between East side and West side?
---
While I agree on most points I do feel I need to defend the SA, a primed BE SA deals a dickton of damage and fast when combined with the right perks, you just need to remember the 6 shot limit after which you're fuxed if still in combat :-)
---
That's right! Thank you for the translation.
---
I tried using a translation site.  Sorry for not being able to speak English.
---
I recently fast travelled to the scorched event to safe some caps after a nuke, and as soon as i finished loading in the event was over..  wtf üòÇ
---
That's not impossible though.
---
Take a picture with a camera mod that hasn't yet been released was impossible.
---
Imo, they both should be merged into just one weapon.

I have 3 golden 3-star Pack Rat T_T

Reminds me of when I got a shit load of 3 stars from a 130 (around that level) when I was 23. Didn't really know what to do with them sadly, but I kept em.

That titlw sounds weirdly sexual.

Railway Rifle skins would be appreciated as well.

I usually try to set up my camp somewhere with a container of some sort that I set up as a "leave a bullet take a bullet" type box.

Thank you all for your replies.   I am going to join Knight_Torren tonight at 8pm EST to give it a run...   wish me luck - and any build / weapon / strategy advice is appreciated!
---
I would definitely make sure I kept plenty of room in my camp budget for me to place whatever it took to make this happen. I think it‚Äôs a great idea üëç
---
[Etsy has tons of them](https://www.etsy.com/search?q=mothman%20plush&amp;ref=auto-1&amp;as_prefix=mothman)
---
I would also propose to eliminate the distinction between auto and non-auto pistols. So basically both gunslinger and guerilla would do the same. I will not boost the pistols but would make my pistol build more playable.
---
You could come check it out but I actually can't afford to repair it right now! Unless you could make an offering of circuitry... it costs about 14 circuits every time I use it!
---
Cross play would help this game immensely
---
That would be great. What do you think about the option to change Nuka Girl suit color or different kinds of suit styles?
---
Easiest challenge ever! Just stay afk in a camp or workshop and wake up/put to sleep your avatar every 20 minutes.
---
Keeps disconnecting on me. Never done this. Apologies, you've both been very patient
---
Right now I don't have the materials to repair it but if you guys can bring a pile of circuits then sure! It costs 14 circuits every time it gets used (to repair all the teslas)
---
Canada doesn't exist in the world of Fallout, it got annexed.

I would definitely rock a half human half goat build.

Thanks! Any chance for an add if you still play?

You can be both! 15 str, 13 per, 1 end, 3 chr, 3 int, 10 agl, 11 luck.

That's my build. You can swap in cards for every type of gun/melee. Endurance charisma and intelligence don't have many good cards compared to the other 4 stats
---
Tameable MegaSloths have not been spawning at the usual locations for over a month... I must have spent upwards of 6 hours total doing server hops to replace the last one the game killed, to no avail... Plenty of deathclaws though.
---
The first 4 MegaSloths I had, I got in Cranberry Glade in 8 server hops max. Did 60 hops last night. Nothing.
---
Put an least six band around your controller stick or set a macro to keep a key pressed on your keyboard. That‚Äôs what I do if I want to sell things while afk for a few hours.

Personally, I'd rather be out and about in Appalachia for 3 hours! But I get your point.

They were wrong.  It's the legendary "Weightless" that works with Chameleon.
---
Woodn't you like to know.
---
A feature. Get off the fucking roof so the queen will land, I hate idiots at queen fights making her circle indefinitely.
---
This. Shotguns are now melee range. The effective range should be increased. 
---
With explosive shotguns, it is even worse. You're either too far away to do damage or so close you hurt yourself. This also makes the shotgun class less attractive because that fact eats away at least a few perk cards and/or armor mods that you could be using for something else.
---
Me too ,first time seeing him. I opened fire at first
---
I'd been trying to think of a way to use it and had an idea for a game for a while, the tricky part was making it so you couldn't escape or flip the switch more than once and cheat. The rigging in the diagram was the solution I came up with.
---
lvl 20 shotgun w/hardened receiver vs. lvl 1 scorched: 2-3 shots. That's some bullshit lol
---
Aha thank you I was misinformed then.
---
1\* gatling gun.  IIRC, it has extra Dmg when aiming and extra DR when reloading.
---
Me too, but I usually hydrate with alcoholo (because the game let's me to). So I'll just me more creative, until I can return to my routine.
---
The last thing i want to hear is someone elses voice or have to talk while i am playing my video games.
---
Kills any and all immersion for me.
---
Nice. The attention to detail shows
---
Rad resistant can be a life saver when you wind up in a nuke zone at the end of the game. 
---
All of the heavy guns/power armor perks suck, because they work together you need to find PA and a .50 cal to even have a chance, but your huge hit box still gets shredded by a guy with a sub machine gun or a lever action.
---
Communist! I'll bet you were in on Anchorage....

Yep anything over 50 years old is public. The entire Beatles collection will be public soon
---
hahaha, of course. I'm the one standing in front of her face and telling the others to get off V9!   
---
I'm talking about the time after. You just kicked all enemies away. Get on top of something to sort out what you can drop. Suddenly a mob of 8 scorched spawns around you!
---
Ah yes, the Chinese Way (who knows what they know?)
---
I still play! Though not as much these days. I'm waiting for Wastelanders!
---
Idk, I've been getting SBs spawning on top of my head when I fast travel lately, damn bats won't leave me alone.
---
Oh, I didn't know that.
---
I got the one from the event.... now I have to find the other to compare.  :)
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I have the exact same one but I couldn't tell you a damn thing about it.  I keep it in my stash and only pull it out to fire out of my back door and irradiate myself lol.  I've wondered just how much damage it would do charged up with 20 shots but have never tried it. Too lazy to charge it that many times.
---
No using alcohol to fast travelling if over-encumbered either!
---
Are you advocating that the OP buy plans and craft armor rather than finding Legendary items?
---
Is there any benefit to learning the various armor plans?  Been playing since Beta and never bothered with spending caps on plans, am I missing something?
---
Yeah thats the part I agree with, pistols are absolutely useless against tougher enemies like the Queen, SB's, Sheepsquatchs &amp;c
---
Maybe your missing a trick then, perhaps since this is a chance of legendarys/death, then the 'entrance charge' could be the circuits required?
---
The only thing I‚Äôve seen them work against other then small things is vertibots...
---
Some guy PMed me and said it does like 17k damage and can one shot a SBQ.  I haven't confirmed it, but if it does that would be hilarious.  I will have to figure out what, if any perks work with it.  Maybe pistol perks?
---
Fucking cool.  There are some serious creative and patient people playing this game.

Funny,  it says adhesive and other stuff on the wiki. ü§î

Insulated is pretty much only useful in PvP.

Can choose a weapon and get a random good one, heavy is minigun and I swear I get it 1/3 of the time (as a rifle char...)
---
Thank you very much!  I am very happy.
---
So the challenge is an inside joke about having all your gear removed when you climb into power armor and extremely easy to to.  Well played Bethesda...
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhy, I'm an idiot.  Thk pal
---
I think a skin for every weapon is very much needed. It's a real head-scratcher that they've made more than one skin for certain weapons and some of them not even popular (the weapons) among users (as far as I'm aware). I would like to see some for pipe weapons and gatling gun, since I use those relatively often.
---
Honestly I'm blown away by some of the stuff people design with their camps. I've never been able to make mine look as good as the stuff many other people do. I've accepted that my camps will all look like hobo shacks that occupy the oddity category of camp builds.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
With the powerfist, you have to be in regular armor, not PA.  
---
For me, while the unarmed weapons do a huge amount of damage (death claw gauntlet, meathook, death tambo, powerfist), my armor DR is lacking, and 2H weapons are too slow (compared to being in a PA and using a 1H melee weapon.)  For me, either out of PA, or in PA with a 2H weapon, the mobs can be quite deadly.  
---
To help with that, I have Nerd Rage2.
---
High Strength benefits both melee and heavy weapons, not so much for hunting and combat type.
---
Since I am in PA about 1/2 the time, Stabilized3 and for weight, bear arms1.
---
Up to about L55, I was melee/sniper.  Gravitated to melee/heavy after I started dealing with things that fly - really hard to shoot down a cargobot (or an SB) with semi-auto or bolt gun.
---
To that end, what guns are you built around?

I collected a full set of each, forest and urban, one for each of my 2 played characters. I'm in the process of finding uny/bols/pr combat set for the main and it's taking forever.
---
My opinion, they're both comparable to each other and both worth having. Pros and cons on both sides.
---
If you're concerned more about legnd rolls than how they look as a set, collect the best of both kinds. You'll have a good stat set to use quicker and can upgrade/add as you go to flesh out the aesthetic part.
---
No worries!
---
In addition to making shotguns useful again, many other weapons need to be buffed to make the game world more interesting. Right now everyone is a stealth handmade aimbot build, with a few meet hookers and gat plasma users running around. Buff Assault Rifles so we‚Äôre not stuck with the handmade (and fixer). All the SMGs need to be more useful too.
---
Incomplete game still.  Come back in 4 years
---
I can't even drink toxic goo anymore... have they changed it?
---
You made it this far, use search function...
---
Happens very rarely
---
It makes no sense to nerf the base weapon because some legendary variant was doing too much damage.
---
Its happened since launch from time to time, is pretty rare though.
---
I've seen that happen before. It's strange. ü§î
---
I've seen this happen months ago where the clubhouse was filled with protectrons. They dropped nothing. I think it happened to me twice.
---
Yup. Enemies attacked my junk extractor, and my turrets shot them... but also hit the extractor. So now the turret has attacked my camp and become an enemy ... turns red ... and attacks the rest of my camp!!
---
You gotta go into build mode, remove the turret, and replace it to make it stop.
---
It just wouldn‚Äôt make sense with the story of the game. Now if you were to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù get turned Into a mutant or something that would be cool.

It's always classy to toss some goodies to a lower level player's way.  I sometimes just log in and go into "Santa Mode" for that purpose.  It's nice to hear about a receiver's side of it and feel like I might be making someone else's day.
---
I was on since launch, so I figured out ways to grind caps, resources, etc., early on.  It makes it easy to part with things I could sell or trade for caps or scrip.  But I remember the struggle all too well.  Grinding ski poles for aluminum (Top of the World, 2nd floor) or plastic (Morgantown Highschool, gym entrance).  
---
I had a few folks graciously drop various high value loot for me prior (and occasionally after).  Why not just toss someone a marsupial serum at an early level just because (it's fun!!)?  :D
---
People have been clamoring about this for over a year now :)
---
Anything goes - Cole Porter. Great song that is still relevant today. It‚Äôs also the song that gets stuck in my head the most.
---
Correct it is a pistol.
---
My assumption has always been it uses pistol perks since you hold it like one.  Now I think I will have to get mine out and load it to the max after work to test this lol. That would be sweet as hell if it really does that much damage.  I don't normally run with power armor so I never really used it since you would be popping radaway constantly otherwise.
---
I feel for you. I hopped a bunch on an encounter spawn and got a bear. Grahm murdered him or he ran off because he disappeared one day. I can't bring myself to do it again
---
I just wish the level up screen would stop bugging me every time I want to change perks.
---
Leaf him alone.
---
In the last couple months I started breaking the power to close doors, don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt think of it sooner but it seems to glitch out after it‚Äôs been triggered and I need to switch worlds regularly. Still a cool way to make some thing close when power is run to it :) another cool one you can do is set a trip wire to closed, then break it to open a door, I used it in the haunted house and it worked like a charm
---
I didn't know how much I needed this until I heard it
---
Do not use extractors,Mine it directly.
---
Yeah this happens when the ‚Äònuke‚Äô is starting to disappear.
---
I got level 40+ Protectrons yesterday, about half with tank treads which I don't recall seeing before.  The server crashed about 5 minutes later.
---
I have a junkies melee, junkies commando and my most recent character has been just using an AAE25 handmade, recently found a AAFFR25 rad rifle as well but anyhow.. it's a lot of fun. I can definitely say I prefer my junkies commando. You can always spam some chems and try it out, if you don't like it, use an addictol and your AA weapons again. Pick some addictions that don't have too bad of minuses to your build. I do have alcohol and psycho addictions because I use them in combat, I think other 3 are mentats, daddy-o and calmex(?)
---
Ah ok. It is weird since most other ores that are smeltable do get extracted as ore.
---
Thanks!
---
How do you build on/around existing buildings?  I've tried before and it won't let me.  Also, how is your camp budget so high?
---
In the nuke zone cycle - the time when there's no airborne radiation, but the plants are still irradiated... My understanding is the eyebots occasionally show up Just before that period ends.
---
At least they drop L1 legendaries, good for script, or giving to low level players
---
For a while I was sitting on acid close to white springs. Well a bunch of people also had that same spot and I just said screw it and moved.
---
Yes they would, as well as rounded ones and matching round wall pieces.
---
Purified water won‚Äôt boil in real life. Only dirty water.
---
All skins for all things would be nice. More mods for certain items would be nice too.
---
I got mine from Breach and Clear I think.
---
Imagine trying to play as a bloodied ghoul with the radicool perk card. How would that work?
---
As someone who wouldn't go afk, that indeed would be interesting. I guess I would switch to purified water to heal me.
---
If you park yourself at sunshine meadows, hemlock holes, you‚Äôll probably see him. But it could take hours... I agree. This challenge is no good.
---
That would be....... I wanna say awesome but "confusing as hell" jumps to the forefront of my mind. Lol
---
I run refrigerated until I can‚Äôt, then grudgingly, oh so grudgingly switch to high capacity to get to the nearest bench, switching back the second I arrive.
---
Just like in real life bud, cheers!
---
Really nice level 620 player helped me get a pet last night. You just need to know the spots where the tame-able creatures are. I have a Yao Guai named Charles now. I‚Äôll probably replace him with a Deathclaw if I can find one.
---
I haven't used chems in a min. Unless I need to travel to my camp without shuffling the entire way there
---
It's kind of a novelty.  Even if you get it fully charged up, it only seems to deal 3,000 damage.
---
Now, I will grant, that if you paired that with sneak, covert operative, whatever the relevant damage perks are, etc, you could probably get that up to 3x that.  But that's not exactly going to one-shot the Queen.
---
Melee uses str, unarmed specifically, uses only one card to increase damage. A deathclaw gauntlet+sneak cards in agility is OP af.
---
Rifles use per, using different specials, there's no reason you can't do both. A build of 12 of one and 15 of the other is very doable. I've been doing it successfully for a very long time.
---
That said, I'm a bloodied build, so it could be that. Still, it's a viable option to try.
---
&gt; Please release like three for each I know it might break lore but it's online 
---
I don't think they need to be lore breaking - i think they've got plenty of inventiveness to produce immersive skins for the various weapons \[lets ignore the Ranger lol\]. They've started down the route with faction skins but there's lots they can touch on for each of the weapons:
---
* Faction specific \[BoS, Free States, Enclave\] as stated
---
* Pre-war, post-war
---
* Military
---
* Well maintained / Not
---
* Festive \[already happening\]
---
* Custom Job
---
* Wastelander bodge job
---
* Hi-tech / Prototype
---
* For energy weapons various venting options to get a visible to other players lighting effect
---
It'd be nice to see them embracing some of the meta too, as various builds come out and start to define a play style to jump on that with a complementary set of skins. They could just be specific to the build itself or where appropriate tie it into a faction. This could be both armour, weapon skin and accessories like headgear and underarmour.
---
As a Heavy weapons build with a hoarding problem I would love to able to fast swap my 15 Strength points between weight reduction and damage perks without getting beat to death when joining scorched earth
---
That was awesome. Thanks so much. Great fun. Have a great night or day or whatever it is where you are. Cheers!
---
Let's hope this doesn‚Äôt apply to any barrel that reduces recoil or something like that.
---
Lol I think I saw that awhile back if you're in the mire
---
I was, but recently moved back to the Forest
---
Ammm. Pistol build CAN kill SBQ solo. But pistols did it not so fast as carbine or heavy gunner, yeah
---
What kind of revolver are we talking about?
---
IMO, because it has a suppress option (and that rifle/pistol quirk), the Pipe Revolver is a pretty good weapon.  The others make too much noise, which breaks the stealth needed to make pistols halfway decent.
---
Endgame both can do great damage. If you find that you don't like the ammo crafting "grind" go with melee. Only downside to melee in endgame is that the queen can be hard to kill because you need to wait for her to land
---
We can use a lot more shapes tbh
---
Jungle is massive!
---
It's already planned.
---
shhhhh, don't tell them. They will immediatly release a hotfix....
---
There is a sentient ghoul coming with wastelanders. I think I remember the name Mort.
---
There's some weird stuff in Helvetia; a butter churn and bird decorations and steins etc
---
Pay to win, pay to win! lol :)
---
I'd like to have the option to change colors on many outfits!  But based on the ski outfit (purple) they are probably going to keep that as separate plans.
---
You will receive a plan when you complete a standard or expert run. This can be done once per day. The most you can get is two plans a day. Once you have learned one set of armor (Strangler, Solar, or Thorn) you have a chance of not receiving a plan. By the time I learned all the plans I was able to craft my Strangler PA which is the most expensive (Vault 94 Magic Steel).
---
Weightless legendary effect and shrouded mod make it weigh 0 lbs, great for stealth builds
---
With all the 5.56 I end up with and don't need, this would be so useful. Wonderful suggestion.

I was wondering if the space suits will still be there as well. ü§î Make sure you get one before, just in case, I guess.
---
I got power armor plans from standard
---
Don‚Äôt forget the flatwoods motel for extra weights.
---
^The easiest way. Only takes doing it 1-3 times depending on how lucky you are.
---
Player vendors are the only place.
---
you can certainly jump in them to hide from other players
---
I find it‚Äôs the MR. Gutsys that become a pain. Their armor piercing rounds are deadly
---
Isn't she already naked?
---
I can't use mic while wife is sleeping and that's the only time I play really. Some people don't even have mics... But I'd rather decipher emotes than listen to loud feedback, chewing, breathing etc from people who don't use the push-2-talk, or the guy at events that has to comment on every fucking thing the entire time.
---
I thought it was 70 or something like that, but yeah
---
What's cringy was them using it on me first and getting me into godmode.
---
There is nothing else free yet that's exclusive to 1st for second month. It took 3 days after my renewal payment went through before I got my 2nd month of Atoms.
---
How about allowing your vending machine to buy stuff for a certain price?
---
That way this wouldn't just work for ammo, but all kind of stuff?
---
My shotgun shows a ton of damage, it hits the enemy nearly 2/3 of their health and they heal almost all the way back. What‚Äôs the reason for that?
---
I miss survival mode! I thought the separate modes was better for everyone. It's not fun when actual PvP opponents are spread out like this.
---
Whilst as a Canadian i think that'd be nice - it'll just mean everyone'll want their nations flags and it'll just devolve into a boondoggle. They'll never do it.
---
Besides as has been pointed out we were annexed and all resistance wiped out. You know, except for that Appalachian cell :P
---
Just make a maple leaf out of those light up panels and a terminal :)
---
It's confirmed they are working on this for future updates
---
I thought Whitespring farmers sell the stable flux not the ingredients? May be wrong but never seen hardened or glowing for sale.
---
I definitely would not mind paying you circuits.
---
That's an issue that a lot of people have with the doors. The trick is: to look for the hinges. That'll tell you which way the door swings in or out in to the left or the right. I am on PS4, if you need a camp built, I build them for my friends and they usually will give me a caps donation for my time.
---
Oh cool! It‚Äôs only been a month and 2 days for me. Thanks for the insight!
---
smooth as butter, that mysteryghoul is
---
I absolutely love these aspects of the community. my daughter got dropped a gift yesterday when  she visited a stranger's camp and I made her afternoon. this actually genuinely happens on the regular to many.
---
Also will add going to public servers every few hours for 5 mins to look at others vendors is a given when i am on my private server.  Also when i am disconnected i can rejoin the same server when i log back in.    I can also trade between characters by leaving something in a suitcase then switching characters and just rejoining private server.  Best ever when having multiple characters.
---
Upvote from me. This would be wonderful!
---
This is the only game, in decades of gaming, to produce an electrical thud through my speakers as though a physical cable has been removed. Sometimes I hear what sounds like a brief sound of area mode even though it‚Äôs disabled. I‚Äôve not returned to one of the public events since it also caused worrying sounds. Sadly what you‚Äôve heard doesn‚Äôt surprise me one bit.
---
I think I need to look into collecting more to sell. I have cheap fusion and plasma cores listed forever, but a churning stick sells right away. My whole vending life has been a lie. 
---
Get ya churning sticks heeeeeeeeere
---
I run 3 heavy weapon cards, 3 commando, and 3 rifleman.  I specialize with weapons instead of flipping cards. I carry a queen gun (prime tse gatling), a mirelurk gun (ie .308 lmg) a imposter gun (vampire ffr .50), a one shot gun (prime instigating +10 aim lever action, and 2 group guns (ie auto handmade and qffr tesla). 
---
The only event I need to card swap is imposter, and only if I plan on being a conduit.
---
No vendor bots sell those, that will make things too easy. You can find them occasionally at player camps but they charge more than a few caps for these. Best way to collect them is nuke zones.
---
One of my chars is a dedicated pistol build and I'd like to see a 1911 .45. Looks good, shoots good.
---
I started as a melee/sniper, but ended up as melee/heavy weapon.
---
Mutants in the forest are easy enough to snipe; places like grafton dam/grafton steel were a bit more difficult until I picked up both a good semi-auto and a vampire machete.  Sniped the outside mutants, macheted the ones inside.  Died a lot in those places until I got some armor.
---
I switched to melee/heavy because while it is doable, it is also tedious to take down a cargo bot (or an SB) with a sniper rifle, and dealing with a mob of anything without a well hidden/protected snipe position is near impossible in some locations.  That said, I got away with it through L60.
---
Then I was triple-teamed by L65 SBs...shortly after that nightmare, I switched to heavies for flying things.
---
That said, up to about L25 or so, you are going to feel underpowered and overwhelmed.  Stay on the left side of the map, work the main questlines.  
---
The overseers quest will keep you in more or less level appropriate areas.    Walk, explore, learn the lore.  AS you explore the forest, you'll get other quests.  Mysteries, firebreathers, BoS/Recruitment blues.  Wavy Willard.  Rose.
---
Roses quest will quickly take you to places you are not ready to be.   Back burner those and carry on with the other quests.    It is generally recommended with some quests (rose and willard for starters), you not return to point of origin until L50 (the rewards are top level), but that can be tough to do.
---
Perhaps? I should mention that I photographed a dead megasloth to finish the challenge; no players in sight.
---
you find me 1 sheet of intact glass I'm building them out of beer bottles and..... shut up..... \*crys in corner\*
---
Just thinking about (praying for) black scout armor skins this morning. Make it so Bethesda. :)
---
Yeah and with no control over which variant gets rolled you can have a great set of legendary effects on a light set of armour. Which just sucks \[and what i have currently :/ \], i had hoped early game that when i learnt the plans to build them it'd allow me to mod existing armour into another type.
---
That was obviously too logical for them to implement.
---
Only for PC users but I've been using this for ages.
---
[Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124)
---
I had heard they patched the legendary eyebots out, but who knows. I used to love finding them, such easy pickings.
---
there is rain catchers in modern life that have filters and even boiling attachments because of airborne contamination - since boiled water still had some rads we can assume based off a mix of engineering and common sense the character placed the a simpler heating element to the drop area to make it boiled water instead of standard
---
that said your missing the real question - how does collecting water make bottles?
---
don't forget those delicious radscorp egg omelettes can help! ...probably making up the delicious part.
---
You mean like Buy Orders and Sell Orders, something games like EVE Online had since 2003? Nah, not in 2019 (almost 2020 now), it's too complicated!
---
There are quite a few veins in wendigo cave. Use your excavator power armor to get double.
---
This
---
Also, Lode Bearing should result in a fair amount as well - Just remember to put on your ExPA
---
There is a fissure site not too far away as well as the mire. If someone likes the workshop building aspect they could do that to kill the time. 
---
There are people who sit at their camp shops and pretend shop keep someone is bound to be ok with sitting there for an hour.
---
It couldn't be implemented since CA is taken straight from Fallout 4, like all other armor types except Scout and wood.
---
I'm okay with how hard it is to get them. But I have a problem with keeping them alive. There needs to be a way to heal them. üò°
---
TRAITOR! After the bombs fell we separated, except Quebec of course. Plus Bethesda loves a boondogle.
---
That was a change early on.  ALL Extractor produced the "refined" product at release, then they made it so that the rarer materials came out as Ore, guess they considered Silver to not be rare enough.
---
So far just my second batch of atoms.
---
Trading forums
---
I have seen them on occasion, but not frequently.  Honestly since 1st I am rarely seeing stable flux in vendors.
---
for some reason Hardened mass doesn't drop at all for me anymore. Been at least 6 months since i saw one drop.  I get glowing mass as frequently as glowing blood but cannot get a hardened drop to save my life.
---
Reasonable requests, eh?
---
They said the modiffy the challenges so they will be "more fun". If i see how much "more fun" their monetization has become over the months, i'am scared we will miss those "easy"  Take a pic of a player in a nuke zone while naked challenges...
---
That's where me and my gf have our houses lol
---
Hey, thank you! :)
---
It could be anything from empty rooms to glowing ghouls, eyebots, liberators, or protectrons. It‚Äôs an equal opportunity workplace.
---
What's the damage that is shown in the weapon stats? With no damage modifiers on the weapons themselves, this sounds like the client going "hey, server, I'm doing 200 damage per pellet!" and the server thinking about it and answering "nope, check again, that's 200+ total damage, so let me fix that for you"
---
thats my spot there (established november 2018)!!!
---
Rent can be transfered as atoms or scrip to my account.
---
thank you very much
---
signed, the landlord.
---
Thanks for telling me how to play a game that I paid for. I am playing the game and I'm not looking for anyone to play the game for me. I'm not looking for a carry. But after running around and not finding the way upstairs and then doing the Collision Course event, I figured I'd ask for tips. Thanks for the heads-up about the keycard.
---
It shows 228 on pipboy, but I thought that pipboy just showed an individual pellet hitting and not all 8. Due to enforcer being the same way of cripple chance is per pellet hitting.
---
It is the specific body damage to the location hit on the enemy then it shows the full health remaining. So leg damage then his remaining health. He isn't gaining life.
---
No the heath bar above goes down 2/3rd of the way and then heals back. Kind of like when TSE used to do that.
---
You have to have budget to use it, but it's not taking budget to use it.
---
You should be able to scrap a chair, fill the fermenter, then make the chair back.
---
It's an old bug that they brought back somehow. üòï
---
I have some of both in my vending machine right now but it sells pretty quickly. Also occasionally see it at Whitespring or Watoga vendors after nuke drops from people selling excess, but it is pretty rare.
---
That's normally a sign that the server is terminal. Wrap up your business, farm for a few minutes, crash.
---
Meh.  The group I occasionally team with ranges from 13 to 72 years old, from all 4 borders of the US.
---
While the 13 yo can be on the impetuous side, he's polite and reasonably well spoken.
---
No, as far as I know the pipboy shows total damage, not per-pellet damage.
---
Never played Eve.
---
I mean, to sell stuff you just put it in your machine and put a price tag.
---
Why not adding the option to add items you would like to buy, price tag as well, so then people can give them to your machine, either in exchange for stuff you sell or some caps you added.
---
Basically like your own vendor bot.
---
I found out the hard way that if you can turn the switch off, other players can turn it on.  And they do.
---
Quadruple even!
---
My pleasure.
---
Got it, weird how each pellet shows the 200 dam then and health goes all the way down. Shotguns really are meant to hit like pip-squeaks then
---
I runs shottys too. I know what you are saying. To me, it is like it was in other FO w im th the vats screen. It is showing how much damage was done to a specific area (head, leg, arm, torso) then it shows overall health remaining. It is the only logical explanation I have come up with. Do you use vats? Target specific limbs?
---
Usually happens right before the nuke zone disappears. Have also seen Liberators spawn there occasionally.

If the Vault door does not open for a player that player needs to leave the cave and come back in. The door should be open. Yes the first boss of the Vault Raids is getting into the vault.

---
Correlation is not causation. Random is just that, it's random, it's chance. Guy A can win the lottery 3 times in a row, get 10/10 mods with 1 INT, Guy B can get screwed and get 0/10 with 30 INT. 
---
I have used over 16 characters over the last year, some super high INT, and some super low INT, and it has no effect on mods.
---
This has been spoken about since back when Fallout 3 Launched race wise. And it's a really interesting argument, but not a new one. Ghouls have a very real chance of being added as an atom shop purchase, you'll buy the ability to look like them cosmetically. Super Mutants will however never get that unless Bethesda create an entirely different race system, and remodel literally all of their weapons and armors, which let's be honest, they won't do. Our best hope of getting something similar to entirely different player races is the Atomic Shop for the cosmetics as seen in ESO, or alternatively, the Legendary Player system coming next year which may have a chance of Ghoulification if we're lucky.
---
Oh myyyy, tyvm :) 
---
Seems like i need to get the hacker perk then
---
I don't use vats as my main is always in vats and that's why I wanted to use this build without it. I look at the full health bar above the enemy and it does that heal, similar to pre-patch 4 or 5 with explosives. Just discouraging to say the least.
---
Its Lemm.
---
I'll be able to play again this weekend. If you haven't completed the quest allready, we can try again.
---
This is an awesome idea. 
---
I would also be happy with an ammo recycler thing. Put in ammo you don't want, get back ammo you do want.
---
Omg no one freeking cares go outside and see a tree
---
I guess you never shot them in real life. A single action revolver is a different weapon. Just because they are both revolvers they shouldn't be merged or something.
---
They should be customizable, sure (a variety of grips comes to mind) but that's about it.
---
Not sure if animalfriend/wasteland whisper are working at all right now.
---
Im L156, but for the last week, I have not been able to pacify any type of critter, regardless of level, and regardless of what type of weapon I used to aim.  
---
BTW, someone here said they ran across a scorched megasloth last week.  I found one near the investigators cabin in the divide. Its hairless with the green protrusions like your average scorched, but has a slightly better disposition.  
---
Couldn't pacify (or tame) it, either.
---
Yeah this is becoming a problem now. I don't bother with turrets anymore because of this.
---
How is this bug still not yet fixed?
---
But hey, thanks for moving a bush 4 pixels to the left.
---
AMEN BROTHER....PREACH! I have kept my shotgun build to hope the days of old come back! Hopefully this gets traction!!!!!!ü§ûüëç
---
Other MMOs usually do 1 at a time and take 1-30 seconds each to complete. Would be a time sink but would give the perks a chance to proc without it dumping all items into a calculator then your bag at once.
---
Give up on it, it ruins your build to have 6 points wasted on charisma for a random pet that dies 15 minutes after it goes to your camp. I used to do it on my main and I have an alt that does it now, but the way they did it is so bad that they instantly die almost always and if not soon after. I‚Äôve gotten like 3 pets on my alt that have all died to drowning, then I‚Äôve had over 20 on my main that die to players, nukes, enemies, or flat out just despawn. It‚Äôs a horrible feature that needs to just be in the atomic shop. I‚Äôd much rather grind 1000 atoms oppose to what‚Äôs in the game now.
---
I can't even see my marker on the compass most of the time. üòû
---
nothing to do with the weapon. Its just another bug, been happening for me for a while. Super muts, ghouls,  just unkillable, and they dont seem to attack either.
---
Honestly, after Wastelanders we should have a patch to overhaul the CAMP system such as making it easier to build camps (I am looking at you can not place object even though it is green.) They could improve the vender system like you said with tracking sales, perhaps even have us preset prices so its easier when you standardized a certain product ( I do 5 caps for meds so I find it annoying when I move camp and have to set all prices back to 5). Perhaps even reduce certain objects camp cost ( looking at you Nuka Cola sign)
---
Atoms should be way easier to earn in game anyway.
---
Some of these challenges are ridiculous. 
---
No, I don't want to take a picture of some guy that is teabagging another guy, while a third one is doing the Macarena naked, all while Grahm watches it.
---
Seriously, who comes up with this crap?
---
I tell you this: when I built my 100 percent unarmed ninja one punch character, I tried the infamous unyielding-bloodied-mutated combo. 
---
Once you adopt unyielding, you become a multibuild. This character now is an expert on anything. He has like 18 perception, 30 strength, 30 agility... Whatever weapon you give to him, he rocks.
---
Is one of these masks a sun mask by any chance?
---
Can't stack Chameleon or Unyielding with Thorn armor, what a joke. I appreciate your work and look into this, I was about to save up for a Thorn set, but that completely eliminates me trying as that is the build I want is unyielding with a chameleon piece.
---
Can't remember the last time I saw this comparison mentioned here since ToW launched.
---
No but I tried to get some of those while the opportunity was there, I did manage to get an old man winter mask but it got removed from a separate sweep after fasnacht day.
---
I believe all we get is atoms every month
---
I haven't heard anywhere on line people compare it to Fallout 76. Fallout new Vegas and 3, of course. Fallout new vegas I heard a lot but that's warranted. They were both made by the same company
---
So you‚Äôre the one who did the cow toss.  Saw that on Mix Traceys channel.
---
I'll friend request you when I'm home, still haven't be able to find a group to complete the raid.
---
Oh you think people were actually comparing them? No that was an internet hate train that was trying to "hurt Bethesda's feelings" as if a corporation has feelings lol. They wanted to show their displeasure and most of those people were on alt accounts. What did they say when you brought up a clearly superior game to Outerworlds? "They're not the same game" lolol
---
I know it's being worked on, but I doubt it will allow for Skill Point reallocation, pretty sure it will just allow for Perk Card layouts. Still damn useful, I might actually start picking locks again, also the amount of times I go to craft ammo and forget to swap my perks back after...
---
[Whitespring](https://i.imgur.com/dkAguI7.jpg), not White Springs.
---
Yea, the one shot on the queen seemed like a pretty bold assessment.  I think I am going to do some testing just to see how high I can get it.
---
Worth noting the most damage is done by unarmed melee, not one or two handed. I recommend putting perks into an unarmed build, and carry a rifle.
---
Suspicious how it all went away, wasn't it? Also funny how they all mentioned Gamepass for $1. Most likely they were all shill accounts
---
Nice, always like seeing ppls builds. Also just watched your fireplace vid, never even thought of that lol.
---
Aha I feel you there. At this point I‚Äôm just to damn lazy to put on lock pick perks just to take them right back off
---
Just scrapped my hardened mass because nobody was buying it at 15 caps/each
---
I just empty those things. It's the apocalypse bro take a bullet and be lucky I didn't shoot you with it. Lol
---
 An we also maybe get a slider for crafting mass ammo? Even for weapons that have viable crafting amounts you have to tap tap tap for sometimes 15+ minutes to produce adequate ammo. All ammo production needs an overhaul from how much is produced per unit to how many units are produced at a time.
---
 Normal ghouls are mentioned twice in the base game. Once inside a sewer where you try and figure out what happened to them, and twice in a note near Grafton telling ghouls to head north for underworld.

Facts
---
There were a lot of shit posts on this sub and the fallout sub about it. Surprised so many people were happy with a mediocre conversation simulator. Wonder how many playthroughs they went through before realizing it was just a small game by a reliable studio and not the second coming?
---
I use combat armor on my main and I have never felt vulnerable. There is more variety, mods are easily available and looks better on n my opinion. 
---
Each one of my characters wears a type. My grenadier only wears leather, my rifleman only wears trapper... Truth is, there is no dramatic difference once you reach level 80 and your build is finished. Qol effects (like reduced weight here and there) and effects (unyielding, vanguard) will be much more important than material itself.
---
That‚Äôs awesome!!!
---
Agreed, same for hacking. Might be worth it if you got half decent stuff but I've been scorned by level 3 locks only for them to contain a single sweet roll too many times üòÄ
---
The only practical reason for the base plans is so you can "scrap to learn" the mods
---
I would advocate for 1 perk card for both auto and non-auto pistols, so gunslinger and guerilla would do the same thing.  
---
The whole reason why I have a pistol build is to make the game difficult again. Took me 65 levels to create a character that is strong enough for non-SBQ PvE.
---
Good idea, but needs to have rules in place so players can't just, for example, take 500 of one ammo type and deposit 100 of another ammo type. Basically so it's can't be abused.
---
Haha, yup! The first televised game of Brahmin Toss!

Revolvers need you to build around them. Invest in luck, criticals, etc. Use stealth as much as possible and carry a silenced 10mm as backup.
---
Although we are getting more gauss weapons. I'd like to see a Deagle for a hard hitting pistol. They need to balance a lot of weapons really. It's sad that they aren't more vocal with the community. There needs to be a difference in your weapon choice besides with some of the lame perks (run faster with a pistol out ü§Æ). Vats and weight isn't enough. One trait I think pistols should have is faster target switching with gunfu at least.
---
This is good as well.
---
Thank you, I did not know that blocking players sorted us into different matches? I will try that for the few regulars im seeing use Aimbot.
---
Someone got griefed i can smell it...
---
That would be useful but not sure how that would work with something like Super Duper. Not that Super Duper works very well anyway, I'm pretty sure it's been busted for a while, seems to only trigger twice, once whilst crafting and once when your done. Could just be a visual bug but I swear I use to get way more ammo using it than I do now.
---
Hey man, its all about survival. Got to make due with what you have.
---
At times like those I go out or read a book and play again next day... maybe.
---
How do people get and use the Aim bot? Stuff like this gets me totally leave titles when the community gets toxic enough to cheat.
---
I play on Xbox, level 177. If I stop by somebody‚Äôs vendor and noticed their bobble head collection is missing a few I‚Äôll drop bobbles...If said homeowner is in camp and I noticed they are lower level I‚Äôll drop weapons and ammo sometimes as well. Some people are just kind I don‚Äôt think the guy/girl meant anything but kindness
---
Likely the same folks that shit-talked FO76 without playing it. ToW was fun for 20 hours over two playthroughs; and that was it. Genuinely amazed it still holds a mid 7/10 user rating on metacritic.
---
&gt; mediocre conversation simulator
---
Nice.
---
I haven't played TOW yet.  I probably will one of these days.  I honestly don't love New Vegas as much as the other Fallout games, so I'm not in a hurry to jump into a worse version of it.
---
Hey I have both 2* uny heavy bos legs if you're not picky lol. + str and + agility...

That'll cost you $10.50 American for that feature. üòâ

If everybody had one you'd be complaining it's to easy and not "imersive"
---
For the sake of interest, I tried to rebalance automatic carbines. Here's what happened:
---
Assault carbine. low damage, high rate of fire, very large ammunition, very high reload speed. A great carabiner for the shooter at medium and close range. The cost of a shot at the VATS is high.
---
Combat rifle. High damage, low ammunition, low rate of fire, very low cost of a shot in the PBX. The best carbine for VATS shooter.
---
Handmade. Medium damage, high accuracy and range, medium ammunition, high cost VATS. The best sniper rifle.
---
I don't have the patience required to build that. Kudos to that guy!
---
Indeed.
---
This \^ he's got nothing to worry about.

I love people speaking English with a strong accent, living in London is a goldmine of nationalities üòé

Looking for poison resist specifically, sorry. Maybe ap. Need left leg and chest

I swear it's tied to your account somehow because I have the exact opposite problem and it doesn't seem to vary at all by server, day or anything.
---
It reminds me of some of the barter or Player-Quest ideas I've seen. The Barter idea is a bit more self-explained, players can put up a trade rather than just a sale. Both parties agree (with a secondary click yes to confirm, no to cancel) and the items are exchanged. As for the "player-quest" idea, essentially a player who maybe needs ballistic fiber or some other item is able to put a request form on a new post-it board item they can set up at the camp. I could see two forms of the board, either a free-standing board or a cork-board. Once their requested item is set they would then be able to list and set aside the rewards. Say for example I am looking for 30 Ballistic Fiber, I could set the award as 700 Caps and some Stimpacks. These items would be deducted/set aside at the time the request is created. If the request is canceled, the items are returned. If completed you would receive a notification the request has been fulfilled and the items.
---
Diseased? They have a virus. As such they have been quarantined

Nope, but since spent 80h on decorating, too paranoid to join party with any one to prevent such actions.

Older people are mostly pedos and predators, so always best to keep youngsters isolated within their own age group.

The western world has really gone to hell in a hand basket.

They can only add to yer camp, not take away. Just take down anything they add. My friends I play with do this to be nice but I still have to remove stuff lol.

He's actually 80 and uses an voice changing devise.

All of those things üò≠

My bloodied combat shotgun compares to my bloodied explosive lever action‚Äîin the 400 to 500 damage range depending on how low I keep my health. 
---
I assumed this was pretty good damage and it seems to do me just fine. 
---
I would expect melee to be able to dish out more per-attack damage as melee players take on the risk of getting personal with the enemy. 
---
I am more effective with my bloodied combat shotgun than my bloodied bone hammer. But maybe it‚Äôs just my play style.
---
Ditto....what they said üîº
---
I have three turrets at my camp by Top of the World and with the leveling changes they kill the Super Mutants and Molerats that occasionally walk into my camp with ease.
---
inb4 "JuSt CrAfT uLtRaCiTe 308".
---
There is very little reason Bethesda can't do a QoL upgrade on the amounts of 308 crafted to be more in line with 50 cal. The two ammos are used in two weapons each... MG42/308 sniper rifle or 50cal/50 sniper rifle. To claim "it's for balance reasons" make no sense given one could craft mountains of 50 cal rounds for a 50 sniper rifle with how easy it is to get the plans for said 50 cal conversion.
---
Here's a tip get a good build lmao
---
You are better off crafting ultracite ammo for the lmg. Whitespring still gets nuked often enough that you can get fluorescent flux easily.
---
Even if it means running to a close river or pond, hell of a lot easier than using that damn water pump. Or if they should at least make the pump produce five units or something at a time
---
Lol, i completely agree üòÇ
---
I have a Rifleman/Unarmed build.
---
Yeah we continue to pay for poor early design.
---
I love watching small critters decimate my turrets, that only make occasional twitching movements and targeting sounds but never lock on or fire. Really funny. 
---
This game ü§£

ROFL :D

It is one reason I will not team with random players.

What makes you think it's music?

You are correct, but they shouldn't have to.
---
Somebody duped a bunch of two star TSE handmades on Saturday night. I saw at least half a dozen in vending machines on sunday. On xbox.
---
They all looked exactly the same and the lfg was flooded with people offering them.
---
I always hope for a nuka shine but most punch bowls are empty and only decoration.
---
I usually chuck out a holotape. Sth like groknak and the ruby ruins :)
---
I didn't say single action.
---
I also believe we should be able to lay things on their sides or place in crookedly...My last camp I built just recently, tried to make it look like it was a junk-pile, (meant to be there by the devs) basically covered the roofs with all kind of random stuff from the build menu...But everything has to be placed upright. You can‚Äôt make it look very junky when everything is standing straight up, I think it would be awesome if you were to pull something you stacked on top of and gravity just kind of lets the piece on top fall where it lands
---
Ok, that's weird.
---
The only reason I want skins is so I don‚Äôt accidentally drop/scrip/sell them on accident.
---
Just the servers being good /s
---
Something from ESO is the ability to make items ignore the surface and clip through. For functional furniture you cant use it in a certain zone. You are also able to rotate it in the x y and z direction so you can do whatever you want. It's a good system that let's do what you want how you want
---
Yea he might twig out
---
Anything you place is locked and cannot be removed by others, only the owner of camp can
---
I love revolvers!  The Western Revolver(S&amp;W Model 29) is one of my all time favorite guns ! I love that old Skool Dirty Harry vibe! But I usually don‚Äôt use it against bigger opponents. It‚Äôs just nice to use on my light work,if I decide to! But I do wish they were more powerful, I‚Äôm still moving my perks around to get the best use out of it,but hopefully the Western and SA aren‚Äôt going obsolete in the game ! I‚Äôd love Bethesda to continue adding to them!
---
Lol let's sorry about a fixed game first
---
This would be a great idea, if Bethesda wasn't breathing down on this subreddit looking for "new" ideas for Fallout 1st.
---
Some good ideas there. And I think the outside is probably one of the most common rounded builds that I've done before. But to make those there is alot of setup you have to do and everything has to line up. It's a pain sometimes
---
We need more pieces, but better still, we need something like the "Place Anywhere" mod.
---
Maybe scrap everything too--it's nice that grass and shrubs are clipping through floors less, but they still stuff in annoying ways. We have machetes! Let us use them!
---
I can't get high radiation fluids.
---
I like this idea, I would definitely visit camps looking to sell my unwanted ammo.  I sell it now but .38 never moves.  If I could sell it at your camp I would have caps to buy the ammo I need from you!
---
It's almost assuredly a bug, albeit one we've never seen Bethesda talk about, to my knowledge.
---
I've heard some arguments that the "corrected" damage is accurate, but I don't buy that simply because it does this halving behavior.  Against a suitably durable enemy, what you find is the health bar acting like 100% -&gt; 1% -&gt; 50% -&gt; 1% -&gt; 25% -&gt; 1% -&gt; 10% -&gt; Dead (if you're lucky).  There's no way the same gun, at the same distance, at the same damage, should behave like this.
---
What I'm convinced of is that either the server can't handle the number of simultaneous hits against a single enemy (which varies based on server performance), and/or there's a misguided damage cap in play that prevents it.  I've heard the suggestion that this started happening in earnest back when PvP damage got capped.  I know, from my experience, that explosive shotguns greatly worsen the problem.
---
It makes even less sense that you can craft a more powerful ammo version in higher quantities than the default type. I mean I get your point but it shouldn't be a thing.
---
ESO??? I‚Äôm drawing a blank, brain fart
---
Have I seen you on Mz. Traci?
---
Elder scrolls online
---
Such a good use of time and resources üòÅ
---
I'm level 173, and if I ever see someone below level 80 doing a silo run I always invite them to a team and then run through with them. Sometimes people don't want the help, sometimes people do. But I enjoy the silo runs, so I always offer to help.
---
In some of the best building areas there are huge trees that I can build around but they really limit my space. The mire is a good example of this. Good look and feel (to me) but hard to build in
---
Elder scrolls online, duh
---
This is true but you can't remove it and when you relog it disappears.

---
AND BROTHERHOOD GEAR!
---
Yeah I get that reply a lot but it misses the point entirely, it's not that you can craft "better" version of the ammo and get more of it but that the default ammo is in such pathetic quantities, it makes no sense at all, and the Ultracite ammo being in higher quantities highlights this stupidity further üòÅ
---
if this game data is saved on Bethesda/xbl servers then the error may have a similar fix to that of having trouble logging in. for some reason, using Google DNS ended up being an easy fix for some PS4 players. hopefully similar for you, too.
---
go to network settings and then use Manual DNS. use: 8.8.8.8 and if it asks for an alternative then use 8.8.4.4
---
then reboot xbox.
---
Most popular thing I've found before is 5.56 ammo. I always make a frew thousand and then stick it in my vendor for 1 cap per bullet. Pretty much guaranteed to make money whenever someone next visits my C.A.M.P!
---
It's just something you find out when messing around haha. Thanks for watching.
---
same here
---
I like to put turrets in my camp in front of set spawns to farm animals or wendigos for screws. This makes it worth because I can save on ammo. But if I use the cheap turrets they don't do good damage or I use missiles and they are more expensive.
---
Being able to swap your special points whenever you like would defeat the purpose of having them.
---
What evidence?
---
Party members can move or add items to your camp, if you ever will get flamingo'd or someone will add secrely placed power connectors that eat through the budget, you'll know :)
---
Never accept random team invites.
---
I wish u luck
---
I mostly talk in Discord with my friends. But even still I will talk to most people if they start talking too.
---
I will be on either today or tomorrow! Very interested, we could even pay caps for the trouble
---
Thanks for the work around!
---
Shotguns used to be my favorite. Now i never use them because you pretty much have to be 3 feet away from the enemy for them to be effective.
---
If they just moved pistol perks to perception it would allow you to use all the sneak and gun fu perks that rifles get. I can crit scorchbeasts for over 600 with a Bloodied prime 50% crit 10mm pistol but it misses a lot out of the 15 rounds each magazine.
---
Except this game isn't a looter shooter. Destiny is a looter shooter, Anthem, Division... Those are looter shooters. This game is a survival game with loot. Wouldn't say it's a shooter lol
---
I find it very odd that there's a lot of dedicated players for fo76. It's not even a matter of "well the game just isn't my cup of tea", this game is No Man's Sky level of terrible but at least Hello Games managed to win back the crowd.   
---
Bethesda just doesn't give a shit.
---
There is nothing that says we have to be from the vault. Once wastelanders hits all bets are off.
---
The worst part is that, at some point before Meat Week, they re-recorded Grahm's voice for some reason.  He now shares this exaggerated Cookie Monster affliction that all the other Super Mutants have which really undermines their supposed toughness.
---
good luck and do comeback to tell us about your legendary lead pipes with limb damage
---
Pretty sure they are charecter locked
---
Nope legendarys are different thing. You use legendarys that are suited to your build. And you get mods easily. Foes drop them way more often than scout pieces.
---
You‚Äôre probably correct though I must vary country to country, the reason Disney bought stars wars was because a Large portion of their library is about it go public, Mickey is old as fuck
---
I'll have to test it with my main tomorrow when I can get more scrip, if I can drop it I know it works, and if not it's already with the right character.
---
I was surprised by her on Friday, got 3 different pieces of armor that were definitive keepers. Almost every one was sentinel or cavalier.

Luck be with you!

I had this glitch after fighting a Scorchbeast, 11 months ago... https://youtu.be/Ec4tFOeWFWE
---
My missle turrets were doing it all day yesterday. I was active for twelve hours and it happened repeatedly through the day at C.A.M.P. and my workshops. Just stored and reinstalled. Repeatedly. Repairing doesn't seem to do the trick for mine.
---
That you have to eat and drink doesn't make this game "Survival". 7 Days to Die is a Survival game, The Forest, The Long Dark...
---
I find it funny that you are so eager to bash on other games, and defend this one in absolutely everything.
---
Even more ironic when we compare the scores and reviews between TOW and F76.
---
East side is the best side
---
Right things like the crossbow
---
Dude you are a god.
---
junglist* massive
---
Any hairdo they add iws going straight to the atomic store.
---
Keep a set of PA for nuke zone exploring.
---
You should only need to use it for the queen if someone messes up the nuke placement, most people that do the Queen now set the blast zone south of D9 so there is a spot to fight her outside the radiation.
---
You will also find having a set of Excavator will come in really handy once you start making your own ammo.
---
These types of stories always cheer me up. There are quite a few more good players out there that we sometimes forget about.
---
Good effort! I like what you did with your shelf and weapon rack displays. I never thought of that, so thanks for the idea!
---
Maybe... If you're a robot... You could have... Little hat

Hopefully you do better than me and my 3 missile launchers 2 Fat Man's and 2 crossbows yesterday üôÑüôÑüôÑ I can't catch a break if I don't get those I get heavy weapons as well which do not fit my current commando vats build. Over the last 3 months I've managed to get like 1 fixer and 2 handmades. ugh
---
I am all for this. I have all the 5.56 I don't need and none of the .308 I do...
---
Ok bud I know
---
hmmmm.
---
Did you just assume there gEnDeR??
---
I'm guessing she accidentally sold something extremely rare at her vendor for 100 caps?
---
Good luck!
---
I had some luck this time around with the 25% off, in just a few 'rolls' I managed to get a bloodied combat shotgun that I have had a blast (no pun intended but lol) using!
---
That's so sweet
---
In short, if you have a proper build and armor? No, you don't need PA. My tank character in full bolstering, mutations and perks has the same DR as my level 50 Ultracite PA. Only thing not the same is Rad Resist, its about 1/4th but if you diluted rad resist and rad shield its the same. Plus, you then get the added bonus of your second and third stars if you aren't in PA.
---
Just ask them not to touch.
---
Then again I don't team with people i don't know.
---
Its not like they can move or delete your stuff they can only add once they set somthing down its yours when they can't do anything with it.
---
Your squad is trash. There are squads killing the queen in less than a minute fro the time the Nuke lands.
---
The new damage threshold is believed to be somewhere in the range of 2k damage or you don't get a reward from the event. This is good for eliminating players who don't contribute, but it's not good when you have teams cheesing her because it costs others caps to travel to the event and they don't get a reward.
---
If you and your squad want to cheese her 3x in a row and jump servers then you should do that on private servers. If you can't afford a private server then maybe y'all should get a job and stop playing videogames all day.
---
Ive just kept a vending machine to the side full of free stuff. Its got a note on it asking to just drop something in exchange for the free stuff. If i dont want or need it, it goes right back into the free vending machine. No harm no foul. But if i like or need it, ill scoop it up and add something else freee. I like your trade idea, but people have been mostly honest with the current way i do it. And if they arent honest? Oh well it was free stuff anyway. Lol.
---
Sorry just seeing this now cuz I was on my way to work I will be on tonight about 8 EST
---
Nope, its purely cosmetic.
---
I have the game but rarely play it. I keep hearing how great this community is so I going to add it to my play rotation. Also, I love the fact that there are PVE only servers.
---
There is a hidden rad reduction percentage for power armor though.  500 Rr in power armor is not actually the same as 500 Rr in regular armor due to the hidden percentage reduction.  You may well be aware of this but good to point it out for OP.
---
Word to your mother.
---
I really dont understand why they so drastically changed nuka cola machines from fo3 to fo4.  Let us stash nuka cola in them and bring back the "ice cold nuka cola"
---
Are you sure you can use it as a stash? I thought that was the milk machine. I might be confused tho.
---
That all changes with wastelanders
---
You need to learn when to close your mouth bud, my personal record is 20seconds.  2nd learn the game bud, when it turns to an event it doesn't cost to fast travel. 3rd bud,it sounds like you seriously need therapy and a direction in your life. Bye now
---
I would advise you to not use an explosive railway because you actually get more damage using VATS criticals and commando.
---
When you activate your critical and hold down the trigger with full auto, every projectile that you fire before the first one registers on the enemy counts as a critical. Explosive rounds remove the projectile delay from the railway rifle and the critical effect that the projectile delay offers.
---
If you want one for PvP, the explosive variant of any railway is pretty decent if you can free-aim.
---
That is great, until you go into a nuke zone, then it is PA or Hazmat.
---
I'm the crazy vendor that gives out free ammo. I really enjoy it. I keep what I need and give out the rest. The honor system is great cuz folks also only take what they need. This way I can take back ammo I might need for another weapon. I do like the idea of an ammo barter system. All I really get out of my system is warm fuzzies but that's okay, so far.
---
Honestly to somebody with 2000 + .38 rounds that nobody wants a recycler sounds great!
---
Good luck bro, do report your result. I‚Äôve dumped 4k scrips, lots of fatmen, broadsiders, missile launchers, all with crap prefix (suppressor and troubleshooter dominated). Only potentially useful item is a bloodied gat laser with FFR, but I already have two of those.
---
So does my B lever, B auto handmade, B auto 10mm, B auto CS, B Pump, Jesus, all my bloodied in fact except melee. All my damage is rubberbanded like crazy. Down, up, down, up. I had to stop playing that character till its fixed, it's stupid frustrating. If you're doing "too much damage" it's like the game adjusts to base damage. 2-3k damage hit on ghoul? Sike, that's 100. 2k damage hit on Queen? Sike, that's 20. 
---
The whole reason I opted to deal damage on that character with the pro/con of he dies if you breathe on him but I could win through firepower. Now he cant kill anything AND dies if you breathe on him. RIP 225, my level 40 now outpreforms you.
---
demo works on any explosive damage whether it's from legendary effects or otherwise. Because of the huge boost from bloodied it can be card effective to use demo expert with explosive based bloody weapons. Heavy weapons have lower damage points so sometimes it is not worth the card investment.
---
Like the idea of the tripod, that would be fun.
---
I think you‚Äôre right actually yeah
---
Not to my knowledge. Itd be nice if they could do it though.
---
Thanks! Will I even need to kill her for a main story quest?
---
All the blue storage bins as well. That would be a nice addition.
---
When u go to home screen- outside of fallout application - is ur screen still black? And what console?
---
*Okay
---
I get them as rewards from the Cop-A-Squatter daily pretty regularly.
---
And while they're at it throw in the bull barrel mod, maybe make it a recoil buff or accuracy buff. It's in the model for .44 pistol camo paint so why not just add it! 
---
Agree with shotguns, decent early on especially for scorched but by mid to late game the dps if far too low to be effective
---
Cool, unfortunately no urban mask on my end
---
shot sombody in the head 0 dmg the fuck is this junk gun
---
Haha haha haha omg I‚Äôm laughing so hard
---
Thanks for the tip. Guess I'll take my friends offer for a free PA frame, than. And yeah thats where most blast zones tend to be. Sometimes Whitesprings.
---
just finished up. no god rolls but putting a imgur link up in the post now. lmk if you can see correctly and clearly. when i zoom it gets blurry
---
results posted! nothing extremely awesome for me but maybe for someone else lol.
---
yea i didnt get anything too great. i switch between commando and rifleman. nothing to greay for me. commando is really only for high health creatures.
---
How about they boost them so more than 2 bored people play with them. The pistols really need some love. Don't merge, add. Add more, add power, add mods. Add a 1911, add a Deliverer, add a true sawed off pistol shotgun, add a Mauser C96 for the Chinese, add a small caliber Deringer. Want power in your pistol? Add a .50 reciever to your revolver turn it into a hand cannon. Add .357 to bump up your .38s.
---

Yea it‚Äôs indeed blurry, only the titles are readable

dang it okay

I would of done 1 point in each gladiator perk for a 30% buff for 3 points instead of 20% for 3 points with iron fist.
---
Yeah, we need something for pistol builds.
---
No it doesn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs an add on. The game still starts in the vault.
---
If she drops what would be a level 50 weapon and you aren't 50 it will be level 40. So I would say it's worth waiting if you've got a bunch to of scrip to use.
---
let us break down the ammo for components/ammo that we can make.  Im totally for 2/1 ratio of recycled ammo to useable components.
---
When i open it in apps it‚Äôs better, still the bottom row is hard to read üëå
---
Good to see that I'm not the only one thinking this.
---
I just have a regular Quad, and it does decent damage. Takes ages to reload, makes the black powder look quick by comparison. The sharp boost for it would come in the form of vats crits +50 and quad.
---
I only just started using Super Duper and I'm disappointed at how rare it is. There's an audio cue as to when it triggers as well but if I'm crafting tons of ammo, maybe 20 - 30 'goes' - i'd say it triggers twice for me.

Ps4, nope, everything is fine except the actual world, all black but still interactable

I thought this is what the suitcases at the train stations were for.  Put in useless ammo, take anything useful someone else dropped.

Isnt there a team up icon?
---
You sure you're looking for a legendary one? Tamable animals in general have about a 6% spawn chance... If those have a 1% chance to be legendary, then you're looking at 0.06%, or 1 in 1,666.
---
So what
---
Also buff explosives please.
---
If he'd also took a snap with a behemoth and mutant hound afterwards he deserves a free month 1st
---
What's even worse is finding a tent there and not a camp
---
I'd honestly would rather do that.
---
Yeah. This was the reason I uninstalled after the private servers. I was waiting for fixes for the massive performance problems and instead they're busy making more money rather than fixing their game. No thanks
---
Possibly the tax brings the cost over the amount you have on account
---
I wish the text just kept getting bigger and bigger as OP lost his mind.
---
If I could give the more thumbs up I would that sounds like an incredible idea wish they would do that
---
Fun fact though, with hazmat you can use a backpack. Refrigerator mod for gathering Flux is ace.
---
So your confirming they actually work well for you? You ever have to repair them? I'm only seeing lvl 1-10 scortched and mole rats show up at camp but the turrets are no match for them. Turrets all have very clear lines of site to enemies and are never too far away.
---
&gt; It does not spawn nuka cola

That's the saddest thing ever.  It could at least chill them.

I‚Äôve gotten two from the Grafton Monster from the Grafton Day event.

I would just like to break the ammo down. Seems like a goof source for scrap.

Had the same thought a while ago and indeed would be kinda neat to meet a player as a ghoul vendor or take down the SBQ next to a player super mutie.
---
But i guess with the "intro story" as a 76 dweller it's nothing we can expect soon.
---
Maybe Wastelanders will open a door to it...
---
Microsoft and Bethesda are currently involved in a payment dispute and it could be affecting some consumers.  They have had an acrimonious relationship dating back to 2010 unfortunately.
---
That's what I call efficiency.
---
DCG on its own is high damage, more if you mod it for the 3rd claw....plus faster swing speed.  Combine that with martial artist.... IIRC, doesn't weight a lot - yea, that's a pretty good one.
---
Didnt no that sweet
---
same, i have $33 in my microsoft account and it wont let me pay for it.
---
I‚Äôm a heavy gunner, can you recommend a price to sell it at? I was offered 10k caps and I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs good enough to take. I was offered 7k but someone else though
---
Thanks,  I'm trying to think of all the interesting new pvp modes that I can.  PVP is my favorite part of Fallout 76 but it feels like there is soooo much more they could do with it.
---
I believe that's the end of the questline, though I haven't actually gotten to it myself. I get caught up in general exploration, legendary farming and events so despite two characters over level 100, I haven't actually done too much of the main quest. I join in on the queen fights for the loot and to gather materials in  the zones afterwards for making flux.

---
And fix how fast shotguns break...jesus.
---
I did the same...and got jack shit...it's all going into the scrip machine outside :/
---
Yeah, I decided to try both pistol and shotgun builds last weekend, with a double-barreled TSE shotgun and a Western Revolver, also TSE. They're no way equivalent to my rifles.
---
The pistol/shotgun are costing 15k caps on my camp, while I look for bloodied handmade/rifle/lever-action
---
Good, Whitespring camps are cancerous
---
yea i feel it lol. im going to sell some of the stuff i got and scrip others. have too much shit clogging my stadh
---
I'm guessing you dont play the game anymore that would be enough for me to trade it in.
---
Scripting fail. Absolutely nothing to do with anyone's PC or connection.
---
But... then how would I hide 12-13 toilets randomly around your place?
---
Nice shot!!
---
idk why I even bother anymore. I've only ever gotten two "ok" legendaries from the purveyor. The rest were random drops off enemies that I cobbled together after awhile...armor drops but damn it took a lot of farming.
---
&gt; Edit: they don‚Äôt include tax on the price and you just have to guess how much it would cost with tax, it‚Äôs dumb
---
Some places, like California, require tax to be listed separately so people can see exactly what they are paying. It would be super easy and nice to have it included in the listed price, but it makes sense why they don't/can't.
---
Are you taking the piss?  Turret camps next to the clubhouse were annoying but ever since they fixed that it's just another place to build a camp.
---
Sure sounds like fun, any player generated content like this is awesome.  
---
That said I'd guess the majority would ignore this as they fear anything that might harm their camp.
---
I'm a similar build I have a set for the queen fight.  Otherwise it just takes up stash space.
---
Need a bullet take a bullet.
---
I feared traffic cones in other iterations of Fallout as they potentially hid a frag mine underneath.
---
Awesome integration of existing buildings!
---
You don't have to drop the nuke on her, you can drop it anywhere
---
Eh, this one is just nit-picking. "Ok" is perfectly valid and means the exact same thing. "Their" vs "They're" matters because they have different meanings.
---
If you like to just team with randos, server hop until your camp can't be placed and no worries! It shouldn't take too many tries, happens to me all the time!
---
Seriously though, good idea. At the very least  YOU should be able to alter ANYTHING in YOUR OWN camp regardless of who put it there. I don't know why camp building isn't  already set up like that.
---
Like the reloading bench from NV
---
gas mask does not protect you from rads.  
---
Radx, radaway, and radshield are your friends, as is nuka cherry.  
---
If you already have mutations, and you pop a full strength (x or away, I forget which), your mutation will be supressed.  Use the diluted version and you wont have that issue.
---
If you do not have starched genes, you will lose a random mutation from consuming radaway.
---
PA will give you better defense from the typical higher level critters in a blast zone, and better RR as well.  Some people scoff at it, but I've done more than one SBQ in (L45) Excavator.
---
Get the batteries included perk to reduce the weight of your cores.   Until you get power user, your PA is likely to eat cores like candy, especially if you VATS.
---
L36....have you done zones other than Watoga?  
---
If (whomever) drops correctly on prime, the fight is closer to v9 and out of the nuke zone.
---
BUT after the fight, you'll need to go into the zone to collect flux - (combined with hardened mass, high rad fluids, and glowing mass - which you get from critters you kill in the nuke zone) which you will need to make things like calibrated shocks for your PA.
---
Inert flux is consumable as water (and it weighs less than purified water.)
---
I dont have god-tier weapons yet - Gatlings (5mm) and AA LMG do a reasonable amount of damage...or at least enough to get loot from the SBQ.
---
I've built a few on those pylons, and agree, getting everything to line up just right is a time sink.
---
But once you do? You can create some awesome builds with multiple levels and areas.
---
Yup! Or let us sell them to the vendors for 50% of the vending machine price in caps.
---
Do that in a separated instance, 5x5 player.
---
Each player must come with a pre built house.
---
Each house has a flag. You may capture enemies flags and recover your own. Flags must be stored on locked boxes lv3.
---
Each minute you hold 1 flag in your box, you get 1 point.
---
Lock boxes get locked again when you deposit one flag.
---
In X minutes the game ends.
---
Not even to finish the main quest? Good to know, thanks. I'll get there eventually.
---
There's a ton of great places to build on existing structures. 
---
If check out Decoys Dungeon on YouTube. He runs a series called "cool and unique camp locations" where he shows a cool spot from each region in each video, including alot of pre existing structures.
---
Yeah will do. I bought 76 last week and I've mostly been building in the mire.
---
Oh man, the mire has some absolutely awesome tree houses you can build in. 
---
I've set up camp in a few of them.
---
Imagine if we had game modes like this that we could isolate by placing a custom located ring of fire??  Game changer!
---
As a few have stated, most base ammunition won‚Äôt sell well.  5.56 and Shotgun shells sell decently well at 1c per and ultracite at 2-3c per depending on type.
---
I sell serums at 250 per.  It should be noted that they sell to NPC vendors with 15 charisma at 500 per.  I intentionally sell them at a gain for patrons just Incase they want bulk to meet vendor daily cap allotment on alts.
---
I sell plans (rare only) at half the default price.  Some I mark up, witch costume, skeleton, and civil war stuff due to rarity.  
---
Legendary weapons and armor being sold for scrip usually sell well at 25-50 c per star.  
---
Quality weapons and armor sell well in the 1-5k range, 5000 for nearly perfect items.  
---
Of course the elusive ‚ÄòGod rolls‚Äô will sell 10-25k per but would have to be exemplar items.  
---
People not following these basic rules will find they don‚Äôt get much merchandise movement.  
---
I make around 10-40,000 every 3 hours playtime on average.  
---
P.S.  Even powered down vending machines are still accessible to patrons.  I would advise putting them behind a locked door, or storing them in the build menus when at or near cap limit.
---
I don't understand, why do people have multiple accounts?
---
The plasma pistol is where all the damage is. I have a TS FFR one and, while expensive in vats, it is a monster in burst DPS. A critical hit on TS will guarantee the secondary projectile hits 100% of the time. Considering critical hit accuracy extends to the first three shots made, combined with TS, I end up getting 6 pin point headshots per critical hit. The critical meter fills fast on plasmas, fast enough to spam those six projectiles back to back. You will be impressed with vats critical plasmas.
---
Pistols are kinda situationally good. Exterminator will give you more armor penetration than tank killer, but only verses insects. Glow sight will give you more damage than any of the commando/rifleman cards, but only verses glowing enemies (and I believe that 60% bonus is calculated after armor reduction making it even better). Crack shot seems super good if you have excellent aim and a scope pistol. Long ago I toyed with it and was met with zero ADS sway on a recon scope.
---
I make a lot of different builds, and before fo1st I used them as storage mules (Ihave a 150+ discord so lots of users) for my other players. Each character I would make sure could still move and fast travel and I gave them quirky names and builds so that they still served a purpose outside of being a level 1 storage mule.
---
I'm on board if I can be an assaultron.
---
Pet collectron is way better, he fetches you junk. And is easy to repair
---
You payed 6x for the game?
---
Wow. I mean I like it. But 1 is enough
---
Melee for sure. I suppose I just got lucky, but I have a fire axe with a +1 strength, +40% bash attack and ignore 50% armor. With NO melee weapon perks I tend to one shot ghouls with heavy attacks, especially in power armor. 
---
Your weapons tend to choose your build for you.
---
I'm extremely interested because I don't think I've heard of that place and I thought I'd unlocked everywhere
---
I started with a full cost Tri Cent
---
I bought 1 PA Edition (when I found it 50% off)
---
The others I bought when they were $7
---
(also gave 2 accounts away as gifts)
---
I have purchased 9 in total but 7 where for $7 each so not too bad.
---
I would like to see the nuka cola machine function as a display AND provide an additional benefit. When the cola has been stored some length of time it provides some enhancement like 5% xp. And how about a clean shiny texture to boot.
---
10k is probably the best offer you'll get. The really pricey ones are bloodied swing speed +strength.
---
Wouldn't be good for the idiots selling .38 rounds for 3 caps a piece.
---
What would be very beneficial would be a setting on vending machines that allowed you to choose a currency to exchange, ex instead of using caps you could use bullets, value would depend on the caliber but .38 would be the equivalent to 1 cap and maybe 5.56 would be like 5
---
I get the same thing with my instigating black powder rifle. A sneak attack first-strike headshot can do around 1200 damage... but it rubberbands like that all the time.  
---
If it's doing enough damage to totally wipe out an enemy's health (ghoul, lower-level super-mutant or yao guai) it functions normally. But if it's a tougher enemy, it'll take down 2/3 or 3/4 of their health and bounce right back. But only on my first target of the fight. If I survive long enough to reload and kill that enemy, any other members of their group will take the correct amount of damage from then on.
---
Ever met a Super Mutant IRL? Ever gotten the electrically charged mutation IRL? IRL has little to do with what happens in Fallout
---
True True. I've only gotten a few god rolls that I've used. Ive gotten god rolls of weapon types I dont use though. Im an avid trader/salesman in appalachia so I trade for caps and weapon swaps to get the guns I use regularly.
---
I'm a melee primary/heavy gunner secondary...both require high strength - you likely would not have to shuffle too many perks to take advantage of the DCG if you were so inclined.
---
  I wouldn't know about prices - from what I have read here, some 3\*s sell for more caps than I've ever had, so I don't usually shop them.   
---
Seems to me you have some good options - guaranteed 10k, backup buyer at 7k.  
---
If you were offered 10k, you could put it in your vendor for between 10 and 11 (depending on how much of the 10% "tax" you are willing to eat), then tell the potential buyer its there.   If said buyer wasn't blowing smoke, then you have your sale and a bunch of caps. 
---
 Or 
---
list it higher, and hope the "right" buyer comes along. 
---
Or
---
 if caps don't matter, you can script it and see if you get something that suits you better.
---
if caps don't matter, and a melee player has a 3\* heavy you may be interested in, trade 1:1.
---
Probably was a mothman cultist those guys seem like assholes, but I'm sorry for your loss that sucks
---
My turrets work alright, though it's mostly low-level enemies spawning near me and I had to spend more time fixing turrets before I put Punji Boards around them.
---
I also had to put one in my house because sometimes enemies just spawn in there. -_-;
---
vampire ffr in on hand, furious ffr in the other!
---
In my experience, the audio for Super Duper is less often than the actual effect. I may hear it only twice, but it procs a few more than that.
---
Why mot help your wife make her dream camp, so she won't have to be jealous of yours?
---
If you make sure your build space + stored items space is maxed out nobody in your team will be able to place down anything new in your camp :)
---
A workable 'solution' you might be able to use until the solution you mentioned is patched in (if ever).
---
More character slots for storage of gear/caps and the ability to safely transfer between alts in most cases. 6 seems a bit exteme,.
---
And you feel your little basic camp is "rebuilding"? :p
---
I do, it‚Äôs just that all the added content is shitty.
---
if you have a water pump at your camp, try Drink first, and then press COLLECT rapidly. It will get you 10-16 dirty waters depending how fast you can press  collect.
---
Why was the Deliverer not in Fallout 76?*
---
Why wasn‚Äôt the Deliverer in Fallout 76?*
---
(:
---
ive probably spent over 1k hours into this game by now.. never really used PAs tbh to me atleast seems like using PA is a huge disadvantage in terms of DMG since it is harder to use stealth.  
---
Stealth and its buffs is definitely meta in terms of DMG in PVE it is overpowered and you can cheesy the enemies really easily.
---
Yeah, I think your able to remove those items still
---
I want to be able to pick one up and scream through it.
---
No, scorchbeasts are not one of the tamable creatures, but it's not a bug, either.  There's a passive scorchbeast that can spawn as a random encounter. It will turn hostile if you do enough damage to it.
---
I got a bunch when they were $7 as I also do giveaways on my Discord.
---
I agree, it feels like shotguns are really mostly good for just crippling these days.  This is a great utility but not really a main weapon class as you'd be better off with melee with the same str in most cases.  
---
Pistols, really if they were included in Tank killer or at the least given a comparable perk to enhance them with AP and maybe some other perk like faster weapon switch to another pistol or similar they would be fine from a perk point of view.    
---
The mod options for a lot of pistols especially revolvers is lacking severely which also hurts them so adding receivers like hardened, tweaked, etc would go a long way to shoring up this weapon class.  Only pipe pistols seem to be fully fleshed out with mod options.
---
double negative'd
---
Fuck that I didn‚Äôt want to engage that animal, I was super low level and using pipe weapons.
---
Ik i was thinking of 2 different sentences while typing thats why i corrected in the comments.
---
They'd still be weak outside of bloodied without an AP perk like tank killer :(
---
great concept, but IDK how well it would work in reality.
---
Was literally standing on top of Top of the World train station - another player hopped up and starts flailing on me me with a supersledge (I'm in PA)- I went open mic and told him I was in pacifist, not interested in PVP, then asked why are you beating on me, the response was  "because I'm bored"
---
Even after being told that, he kept right on for several minutes, to including trying to (marsupial jump) into line of fire while I was trying to take down a strategic cargobot.
---
Still, wow :p
---
Seriously, just from reading this I think you might spend too much time playing. At all. Do not forget reality. (Don't get me wrong, finally, do what you want!)
---
But yes, maybe some more char slots would be nice.
---
I started 1 char at beta launch (until lvl ~37) . Then another at release (~lvl 135) because I want all PSN trophies and some didn't count in beta. Recently I started another char because I want a rifle build beside my heavy/shotgun.
---
But while playing I also thought it would be faster to switch my existing one. It has unused skill points.. but I also want to keep it so I go on with the new one.
---
That's my sloooow style of playing fallout. I've got to say atm I have 0 problems with the current character limit.
---
I would struggle badly trying to keep that all straight.
---
Nothing has changed, they're just that rare. The spawn chance is somewhere around 6%. People often spend ***dozens*** of hours searching the proper locations with no luck.
---
Nah too heavy. Ill take some 5.56 though
---
I agree with this. Right now it‚Äôs not feasible to spec into both since you don‚Äôt have enough points for all the cards. Right now it really limits your build flexibility if you want to try and use the pistols.
---
Update your geforce experience
---
There's 3 options:
---
1. PA
---
2. Hazmat suit
---
3. Chems and a group sharing the perk "Rad Sponge".
---
   1. For this option you need to stay in close proximity to your teammates at all times to proc the rad healing effect.
---
   2. Rad shield is the best chem to use for this option.
---
No point in having more than 2 characters, the one you play as and one mile, any more and you're playing wrong.
---
Assault rifle just needs some kind of unique attribute to make it worth using. It‚Äôs okay for it to be weaker but it‚Äôs totally outclassed by the handmade and fixer. A buff to its fire rate would help a bit to bring its DPS closer to the others.
---
The black powder weapons are FUN weapons, simply put there for you to challenge yourself, if you can't step up to the challenge and slap titties all over the place with those lead balls then just don't use the weapons. Stop whining and crying over every little thing..
---
Well I would like to refurbish already existing structures, but obviously we can't for the most part.
---
I think it'd be fun and add to differentiating each class a bit with pro's and cons. Dual wielding could introduce some interesting effects, obviously accuracy is going to be the first to go, but you're adopting a double rate of fire and sacrificing that. Second i'd say there'd be a lengthy reload duration, because you just don't have the ability to do that with both hands full with any speed.  
---
That may be itself a mechanism, dual wield until the first reload and then you're single pistol until a cool down period has expired \[ie no shooting for 30 seconds in game\].
---
Whilst there's a lot i think you could do i can't see them investing the time when there's easily resolved weapon balance issues \[ie Laser as a whole class\] that haven't even been looked at, much less adding in unique mechanics to make all classes viable through the game with interesting pros and cons.
---
We're lucky to just see the Plasma and Gauss classes getting additions in Wastelanders...
---
I also have a base that is not near a water source, positioned right behind the station vendor in Morgantown for easy vendor access.
---
The amount of time it takes at the pump is ridiculous. I can run to the nearest river (which isn't really that close to me), spam to collect water, and get back to base in less time than it would take to sit at my base and click the pump. It is pretty stupid how long that takes. And there is no logical reason for it.
---
I just leave mine in a bag in a special spot in my camp. I've seen plenty of others do the same..
---
FO has always been my go-to game (since 1). To keep myself interested I make builds and stuff (posted a few on Reddit). I found it less of a hassle to just level new toons then to respec old ones. At this point, it takes me 4-5 days to get to 50 on a new toon. I like doing themes both for character build and bases. I also do other things I just have bad insomnia so I only get 304 hours of sleep a night (had this since 2006 so I don't think it's going away any time soon XD). So I do my normal family responsibilities and after everybody else is asleep I have another 6-7 hours of time.
---
I disagree I like making builds and posting them, and it is shorter for me to just level a new toon then to re-allocate points)
---
Its a pain for sure but never experienced it until last weekend when I took a power plant.  Darn guns did their thing and then turned on my camp.  This should get address soon I hope.
---
Reminder that 12 minutes or so remain till its 7pm UK time. If you two were still meeting up
---
A shortcut and a display on screen of the current status would not hurt.
---
Toxicity will still be toxicity no matter what color it is.
---
...I have an excel spreadsheet tbh XD
---
I use it mostly to dilute the meds and just sell those. Usually get all 1400 of the vendor's caps, daily, just by selling surplus diluted meds and crafted food.
---
I don't really see how your example does anything but support my idea?  This bored player could look on the map and find someone NOT in pacifist mode to beat on.  
---
Wouldn't it be better if that player could have found another player who actually wanted to PvP with them?  It would have been a win for both of you.
---
I don't have no answer for you.
---
Obviously OPs idea isn't going to make every irritating player go away, but it's not for them anyway.
---
I like to PvP in this game, but I'd rather not have to run up and whack random people or invade workshops to get involved. OPs idea would help players like me who enjoy PvP, but aren't interested in griefing.
---
I didn‚Äôt think players could kill pets. When I had pets, people shot at them all of the time but never killed them. My pets always either spawned in dead, or were killed by other NPV‚Äôs.
---
AGREED. Pistols need more mods and suppressors are critical. If no supressors are coming, they need much more damage to compensate for the lack of stealth.
---
Toxicity =! pvp.  
---
The most toxic players I've run across hide behind pacifist mode so they can be jerks with no possibility of reprisal.
---
PvP isn't toxic. OP isn't talking about griefing. A simple implementation like this would only increase the community's health. Get some perspective.
---
Yea there are so many parameters that they can play with in order to make different rifles stronger in certain aspects and weaker in other areas. Some shoot faster, some has higher per shot damage, some kick harder, some have lager mag, etc. I don‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt realize how poorly it‚Äôs balanced now. When there are five players gathered around some vending machines, four of them would be some explosive handmade build, it‚Äôs just very boring to look at. Maybe the dev has a thing for AKs, that‚Äôs the only logical explanation.
---
Runescape GE reigns!
---
I‚Äôm the same build as you, and rarely use PA.  I just wear a hazmat suit (and sometimes pop a diluted X-rad for safe measure) if I need to go into a nuked zone.  FYI I have max level Iron Clad, Blocker, and Lone Wanderer perk cards equipped, and have two pieces of Bolstering, two pieces of Unyielding, and a piece of Chameleon armor.  I feel pretty ‚Äútanky‚Äù for a non-PA player...
---
It wouldnt though at all. Pvpers know very quickly.if the person is going to fight back.
---
I converted from 308 in my Sniper Rifle to 50 Cal.Simple reason being there is not enough of the 308 around in [game.So](https://game.So)  you need to keep making Ammo it might as well be the best Ammo 50 Cal.
---
Plus It was more practical to use the same Ammo in my Sniper Rifle build, and the 50 Cal explosive automatic that i use at SBQ events.
---
Plus you get a damage increase changing from the 308 Ammo to 50 Cal in the non automatic Rifle.
---
SBQ Fight is a harsh on Ammo supplies.
---
Spend the nest week or two farming Lucky Hole Mine,and buying up Bulk Steel everywhere daily to get on top
---
I now have 90,000 rounds of 50 Cal ammunition that i use daily in the Sniper/Melee build,and at SBQ Fights.
---
And use Super Duper Perk.
---
I want Tesla armor from FO3. Coolest armor. It buffed energy weapons and combined with the tri-beam laser rifle it was awesome.
---
Thats not what im saying. Im saying traditional pvp players know damn near right away if someone is willing to fight. So it wouldnt change anything.
---
You have to use the tall steel beams that are under the stairs category. Set down your first set of stairs, put two beams stacked on the top. Remove the lower beam, then you can get another set of stairs to click in.
---
I really don't like the idea of making servers smaller tbh.
---
But there‚Äôs not even other corpse around. Only a player there. I heard gunshots and I headed back to check. Then I find my wolf‚Äôs body.
---
Because you got on the right server or saying you bought some in attempts to discredit me. Look we know how the game works and it‚Äôs always a gamble. I‚Äôm just stating my experiences lately
---
Its not our fould then  i gues
---
You can drop it anywhere and the quest will complete
---
Thx for replying!
---
Vendor bots after nuke zones occasionally have them.  
---
Once in a while you can also find HR fluids (although I haven't seen those lately)
---
Benefit of hitting a nuke zone with a team of trusted players.  At the end, you can pool mats and divide the resultant stable flux.  Did that in Watoga - took a poll of who needed what - I needed something like 140 violet flux (for calibrated shocks on multiple PA frames) ; we all collected flux.  IIRC, between the 4 of us, collected a bit over 200.
---
Because I had previously done multiple nuke zones gathering mats but not making flux, I had a supply of both masses and HR fluid they didn't.  They gave me all the raw violet flux, I stabilized it.  Kept what I needed, gave them back the rest for helping me collect.  Everyone was happy.
---
. I'm ok with things that require little time or will happen naturally at some point (like drink a cherry), but change that much my gameplay for 20 atoms? nah....
---
It's a hard-to-swallow pill, but when a ingame task gives so less than begging money on street, you should rethink about the task.
---
How much cost 20 Atoms? 20 cents?
---
This will never happen.
---
I do not want fewer players per server.  A larger camp would be nice,but not at that price.
---
Always did want a more "rebuilding" focused sort of thing...but much like in fallout 4 there's a limited amount of rebuilding even possible.  The fallout engine isn't designed for "World Shaping"...the world itself is a fixed thing, immutable and unchanging.  Which means anything they let you build has to go on "Top" of the existing world...so rebuilding anything simply can't happen.  
---
I'd have loved it if they had redone the entire engine to allow for more world-shaping sorts of activities...so that we could make a go of ACTUALLY rebuilding Appalachia.  Sadly, that isn't going to happen because of the limitations inside the engine itself.
---
Same here. Mabey they used a nuke mine or something?
---
You can download PS4MouseToController. You'll need a PC to run the software though
---
I feel like very few people would use that "properly"...  the rest of us would just write something like testicles..  that's what I would do.. ü•¥
---
That's a ton of build reworking
---
I have so many mini nukes and missiles that no one buys. I'd love this.
---
You're right, but it also sucks.
---
It makes me wonder if I should bother buying camps items from Atomic Shop.
---
point taken.
---
I‚Äôve thought this since day 1 I usually list a lot of ammo at my vendor for 0 caps but if it sits for to long I just end up dropping it. Feels like a waste.
---
Although really I think that "Linked Camps" might be one of the most useful features they could implement.  Allow you to link up your campsite to your friends (allow for a larger contiguous build area, with the accompanied warning that the camp will not be able to be placed unless you rejoin a world and re-team with the same party as before.  And even then the camp will not be placed on join but must be placed afterwards with all the problems that entails).  
---
Even allowing it but limiting it to a single session or a private server only option would be appropriate in my eyes.  You'd get to build MUCH larger structures and quite frankly the minds of some of you builders are amazing...I'd love you see what you could come up with working together like that....
---
Shit is going to get real hard without combat perks later in the game.  Not having backup weapons for the inevitable weapon breaking mid fight certainly adds a huge challenge.
---
I buy 40 fluorescent flux and craft 6k ultracite with it. Easy.
---
How do you transfer caps between characters?
---
exactly and well said.
---
It would eliminate the need to find out whether or not the other player wants to engage in PvP. That's a nice change. There's no way to find out atm other than hitting people (which can get annoying) or asking over mic. Letting PvPers easily identify one another is a nice QoL change that benefits both types of players.
---
i know the point of the game is to feel empty- it is a wasteland after all- but i don't think cutting 25% of the players per server is the way to go.
---
I feel or, felt, like a dumb ass using 3 pieces of Chameleon armor at one point assuming it would make me super invisable.
---
So where do I find Hazmat suits?
---
Or it would give griefers targets.
---
I like the idea of the 3rd option but would it work with just one other? Would it transfer of only one person has the perk?
---
I get it. You arent not funny
---
Alternately, you could tune into hunter/hunted radio freq. Anyone who joins def wants to pvp no questions asked.
---
I have a feeling that when you see these items at a vendor bot, it‚Äôs from players selling their excess.  I don‚Äôt think they ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù are part of any vendor bot‚Äôs inventory (somebody please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong).  In particular, the Glowing Mass is heavy, so I sell it when I have way more than the other materials...
---
They can actually renew the licences, so this is incorrect. I meant stuff that doesn't have an owner
---
Thanks for the tips.
---
Yeah I like stealth just because of that purpose. Makes PvE a bit fun for me, too. Feels better than just rushing in balls out.
---
PvPers do my Head in.
---
Like 3 year olds with ADHD pulling at your Pant Leg screaming "Play with me"....."Play with me"
---
Even if you kill them,they come back looking for more.
---
I learned the hard way by engaging,you are actually giving them what they want.
---
What i have started doing is ignoring them.Then launching Nukes at their Camps just for fun.
---
Not got one yet,they are pretty savvy,one day though.
---
You still don't have it 100% correct. Yes junk doesn't matter cause its 1 item with a quantity. But there still is so many unique ID's to keep track of that hardware limitations are still a very real thing. you can have numerous of the same gun all with different ID's because of mods and durability and such.
---
I'm built stealth/rifles, and it wasn't a mistake to build as such; it's a very easy, effective build.
---
As others have said, the *only* place where PA becomes a consideration is in nuke zones. But even then, most nuke droppers are smart enough nowadays to drop the bomb in a way that you don't even need PA/hazmat to do that fight. (Essentially, you catch Site Prime at the edge of the blast radius, and the fight takes place at either Forward Station Delta or Drop Site V9.)
---
Unless you want to wander into a blast zone, 75% of the time you won't even need PA for a SBQ fight. With sufficiently good armor, her damage is easy enough to minimize (although at your level you might just want to make sure you don't stand in her screech area too often).
---
If you're just wandering a radiation zone, Hazmat is fine, unless you get swarmed by glowing ghouls. Grab yourself the Marsupial mutation and use that rifle build to keep yourself out of range (on walls, roofs, etc) when fighting, and you'll be fine in Hazmat.
---
All that being said, all you really need in life is a 10lb PA suit, and maybe ~3-5 cores at 75%+ charge, and you're set for any situation. That's 25lbs tops, which should be manageable even at 1 STR if you wear any sort of backpack.
---
Yes, it‚Äôs shitting itself again all over, as per the usual from any Bethesda ‚Äúpatch‚Äù.
---
I only barely explored Watoga. Trying to get the backpack now. I'm a bit late to that party.
---
what platform you on? if you want we can trade, ive got a lot of .308 and need 5.56 lol
---
They can if the animal is susceptible to radiation though, right?  I could be wrong..
---
FO76 isn‚Äôt an MMO, though
---
Five god damn times in a row is the most I got before giving up and using the private server. I'm glad I have that option but it needs to be fixed...or changed.
---
No more than is already the case.
---
There‚Äôs zero point to paying money for an item your punished for using. Common sense 101
---
Sell a bullet for the amount I want them to hold
---
Yes it would. Youve just given everyone a color code. Lol.
---
Yep, they screw over any part of the game people like- it‚Äôs always been a real head scratcher.
---
Permadeath without pvp maybe otherwise new players will never make it. Tbh survival mode 2.0. Just make a better system and allow ppl to be in defense mode like in RDR2 online but obviously there needs to be penalties
---
OPs suggestion is an attempted solution to this behavior.
---
This is why i miss dupers so much
---
People all want the same ammo types. It needs to be an exchange like 100 38's for 25 5.56 or some sort of balanced trade out system.
---
Just put it behind walls they can't edit. My personal area is a maze on purpose and if you really feel like it put a few traps and kill em.
---
Horrible.
---
Similar thing happened to me.
---
I killed him though.
---
I was going through his stuff he killed me,i ended up in a loop.
---
Next time i kill a giefer and he is carrying too much loot for me to carry.,i am logging out immediately with all his stuff.
---
welcome to our world :)
---
No sweat - we all have to start somewhere, and it's definitely a learning curve  :)
---
I've been playing since January - I just got the standard backpack a couple weeks ago.
---
Yeah I was just thinking about something like this a couple of days ago when I went to like 3 different camps and they all had REGULAR weapon/armor...
---
I vote for an \*asterisk w/how many legendaries are in the bin! 
---
i.e. Armor 23 (\*18)
---
how about a private‚Äùbuilder‚Äù server. you get to build at every workshop and 3 camps with massive budget...all progress is saved when logging off and you are allowed up to 8 people to join.
---
Great idea I'm sure they will add it for fallout 1st subscribers....
---
I can check for you for sure when I get home sinc ei have the armor and weapons. But I do know right now that a weapon with RW on it only apply to the base weapon, so any mods placed into it add a ton of weight. While armor with wwr in it apply to BOTH the base weapons and any mods placed on it
---
That‚Äôs the joke.
---
Wait...
---
Just go wood armor its the life
---
nah. ruins the market
---
Never had a Brahim live 24 hours.
---
Dont waste your time.
---
Right...right... you caught on hmm probably should have removed the flair?
---
this is already a thing actually, a rumored atom shop thing; but still a thing  
---
was found in the files while back
---
I was able to pacify a wolf one day but he got killed immediately after by some scorched down the road. Pissed me off. 
---
Also had a mirelurk king for like a day before someone killed him. 
---
Best luck I‚Äôve had is with my radrat pup. He‚Äôs tiny and stays pretty hidden. He‚Äôs also cute and smiley
---
Yeah but having more than 6 points to play with in agility would allow a lot more flexibility. There are too many good perks in agility to use 9 points on pistols for the overall performance of them.
---
It's information that can be quickly obtained currently by striking another player. If someone is out to pester you, they'll find a way. This suggestion is more useful for PvPers than griefers. At worst case, pacifist is still a solid protection. They can't do much besides annoy you or chuck nuke mines, and the latter is due for a patch.
---
Shiiiiit, that‚Äôs clever. Thanks!
---
Anyone still playing this game is either dysfunctional or embarrassed- neither going to talk to strangers.
---
It was found back a while ago in the game files that a ammo break down system will be coming, who knows when; and its supposed to sadly be atom shop i believe but this part who knows, maybe they end up being nice and making a feature for all players ( like it really should be)   
---
nonetheless, its coming in the breakdown system eventually
---
What country are you in?
---
Pick hunting rifle sneak headshot everything till you hit lvl 50
---
you could easily trade that with players in here or selling groups; many many many people would bite on a trade like that lol
---
Good idea. Hard to implement into a multiplayer game where people are constantly on different servers
---
Maybe...maybe not, could always gate it like ESO.  Pretty sure there are no CP servers, under 50, etc...
---
Are you really going to risk losing your level 25 character with that nice 1\* TS that finally dropped because you blew yourself up with a grenade going after that level 5 noob?
---
There are also other factors to consider, maybe you will risk it just for kicks, but how are you going to find them? No one is shown on the map...
---
I'd love this!!!  I need 5.56 .45 and shotgun bad but have tons of missles, mini nukes and .38
---
Now that's what I call a critical hit!
---
Playing 76, im sure that stranger isn't the only one making your wife's night.
---
You have to think though, do you even interact with 50% of them? The 25% would be lower levels that are not really ones you see. The world would feel no different, but be less buggy and everyone would be able to build more.
---
It is a good idea.
---
Until then run with pacifist mode,next time you are attacked /note their name/find camp/Nuke run. :-)
---
I always presume Nuked Camps are mostly those of absolute t\*\*\*s.
---
Never had anyone Nuke mine.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm up for the bump in output from the stupid ass pump. If it put out 5 or 10, hell even 3 per pump it might be worth it
---
Pacifist is still solid protection. I agree. Pacifist is still what i use because personally i avoid pvp like its a cancer. 
---
Sometimes dummies forget to turn pacifist on. And yes thats their fault. Entirely. I agree. But youve just limited the field for a griefer to know who specifically to target now. 
---
I feel like the chances of someone willing to pvp vs the chances of someone forgetting to turn on pacifist lean heavily in the favor of the latter. 
---
It sounds good. But i dont see it playing out how it sounds. I can already see 70 more reddit posts complaining about it if it were to go into effect. 
---
I also think there are many more important things that need fixing before we even get to see this issue on the horizon.
---
True, it's not viable to stay in the nuke zone for extended periods of time, but short in and outs, or queen fights on the outskirts which most are, this will keep you from dying quick while giving the benefits of armor. If your good with the quick menu and radaway, this will suffice.
---
I quite enjoy finding a wall that my friend doesn't look at often, and adding "PENIS" in big bold neon letters, just to see how long it takes her to notice.
---
The same exact thing except with an exclusive character slot that resets every month. No OP broken weapons, everyone on a level playing field, use your wits and resourcefulness to survive, not your duped explosive gatling laser.
---
They nerfed TS and explosive legendary effects, along with Dem Exp. They never nerfed shotguns.
---
And no, you couldn't just one shot the queen without preparation. Weapons were still below 1k damage.
---
Same. My camp is near Huntersville, none of my pets last long there. Almost all pets i have seen are in camps in forest area prob because of low level enemies.
---
Whitesprings camps are only good as vendors. But they are mostly the same unoriginal boxes. And no resources to make our lives easier
---
They never nerfed the base weapon. That comment is wrong. They only nerfed TS and explosive legendary effects, along with Dem Exp.
---
haha thanks!
---
8 Rolling Pins.1 Pool Cue,and a Bone Hammer incoming.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs it.
---
Ohh, I like that monthly idea! +1
---
I have noticed.  Figured it was a wallpaper glitch.  Kinda irksome but oh well.
---
you would certainly have to.
---
U need quad 10% damage while aiming to oneshot sbq
---
Same thing happens when I use explosive weapons on camp walls if I'm not in pvp. Seems silly for me to be able to break in if I'm currently fighting
---
Dont think i can do it.
---
Nukashine has destroyed me.
---
I am forever waking up not knowing where the f\*\*k i am.
---
I even blacked out during a SBQ event.
---
Jokes getting old now
---
Not on music.
---
Nukathon Incorporated
---
Nukathon as in Marathon..but with nukes
---
I tried
---
That's very good  to know, thank you. Now I just have to get around to completing that quest.
---
no joke I also have a spreadsheet of all the armor and weapons my guildies can use, and also who has items out. Keeping tabs is it's own game XD
---
A recent patch introduced Plans for the hazmat suits (I‚Äôm not sure which vendor boys have it), if you want to craft one yourself.  A lot of the mines in the Ash Heap area have the suits in the locker rooms (typically just inside the mines).
---
Hazmat is a tough play though. Armorless is doable it just takes a particular set up. Team rad sponge greatly helps as well if youve got 4 people in the rads, and pharmacist 3 occasionally spam some radaway. Rad x diluted, rad shield, rad 25 on 5 pieces, lead lined on all 5, lead lined back pack. Then use Mysterious savior 3 or a piece of life saving and healing hands perk, if you go down, pop right back up no rads. You can do that 2 times every 60 sec. 
---
It's a tough build to sell cause the damage perks are non existent in a tank build, but it's possible.
---
If you're not interested in PvP, you should never remove pacifist. You pretty effectively argued against yourself in your second paragraph.
---
I agree that we're unlikely to see this issue addressed, but I find the simplicity here is one of the best parts of this idea. How hard could it be to implement a color change.
---
You‚Äôre a day early claiming ‚ÄúThe latest patch totally broke the game that was already completely broken!‚Äù post. 
---
Try after tomorrow when the patch is actually released.
---
Yeah, makes sense. I‚Äôm in the NW savage divide so it‚Äôs not too bad but a pain when I‚Äôm finding pets in the forest or elsewhere that‚Äôs far away. They often never show up because (I assume) they get killed along the way.
---
Really.  I had 5 days off this week, and played a whole lot, and never noticed any new issues at all.  A couple CTDs, one crash on using a chem in combat.  No other issues at all.
---
You wouldn't be on XBox by chance?  They seem to get the brunt of the problems.
---
I'm fairly sure the RW on the weapon stacks with the 90% wwr armor cap as I have that armor and I've seen guns in my inventory with RW that weigh less than grenades lol 
---
However the modded ones still weigh a tonne as the mods aren't affected by RW.
---
Glad you agree üòâ
---
Or both
---
Heavy combat for the chest, heavy leather for the limbs is the best DR/ER combination, IMO. Scout is solid across the board, though.
---
What playtimes are you active?
---
One person shares the perk, all 4 benefit (unless one is already using it, it doesn't stack). It's a life saver for PAless builds in rads.
---
i don't see your 4th point going over well if it's implemented. 76 is an open world online game. it can last a long while. having to start over fresh from the vault upon every death seems like it would dissuade people from even playing. i can see the smashed keyboards and broken TV screens from ragequits now...
---
that said, i do like your first three points, but would be happy with just a general "better" survival mode. i played the previous version maybe twice. wasn't impressed, and when they took it down i felt nothing. makes my Medical Malpractice pistol a bit more of a trophy, though.
---
They seemed to be working in that direction, they'd talk about 'seasons' briefly at one point. Seemed like a really good way to handle things, only new characters at the start of the season, and they retire or move to adventure when the new season starts.
---
I got mostly crap during this sale with a few exceptions, two instigating fixers(one 2* and one 3*, that one is ffr) and this morning I got a 2* BE pump shotgun. A lot of crap too though.
---
LOL, why are you worried about people worrying about 1st?  I just auto-renewed my second month and have no problems with saying it.  Those people who are bitter about how I spend my money or my time can just be bitter, lol.  As if worrying about some gaming companies' practices, while ignoring the real issues the world faces matters in the slightest.
---
You want CAPITALISM, you got it!
---
Goodbye stash space
---
yea. same here
---
do you mean like a gap between individual pieces laid out in a straight line? i don't have anything like that but that seems like a weird, but serious, problem.
---
This mindset is why I keep my mouth shut.
---
So i argued against myself by reiterating my point that youve limited the field to greifers?
---
No though, it is your fault to forget to turn pacifist off. Totally your fault. And the greifer would most likely sniff you out anyway. I just dont really see any need for the change because when it comes down to it, isnt hunter/hunted still a thing?
---
I understand where yall are coming from, i do. I just dont think there is anything wrong with the current system. I dont think its a good idea. 
---
Its def a simple idea. You are correct there.... As far as i know anyway. Which is squat when it comes to programming.
---
Players can't kill other player's pets
---
as long as it's not impacting my ability to place my camp freely anywhere, sure
---
Survival but no damage cap and top killers on the map. With added pvp incentives. And a function that identifies your account if you come onto reddit to bitch about it that puts an unequipable diaper on your character.
---
Yeah, that sounds very reasonable...maybe even if you die it just shifts to adventure (if you have free space) +1
---
Build 4-5 auto pipe rifles/pistols and drop them and 200-250 rounds of .38 each off in separate bags outside of 76. :D
---
It sounds simple but you're asking them to rewrite code that's been in play since 2008.
---
AKA not going to happen. Buffing from a programming standpoint would be an order of magnitude easier.
---
Did they have power armor
---
Haha I would love to see your final build tree
---
That and grass growing up threw my floors that never was before.
---
having it be a seasonal monthly thing where everyone, even the "winners", get reset seems way more fair and balanced than just general permadeath. various stats could offer rewards too, like the challenges they had before. "kill X scorched without dying before monthly reset- get a special pistol, kill X scorchbeasts- get a power armor paint, etc."
---
Sooo wastelanders?
---
&gt;The RAM would be the only thing to cost money, which would be a one time purchase. 
---
Uhm, Bethesda doesn't own the servers. They lease server time from AWS.
---
The reason for the limit is to prevent crashes on the client side.  The servers don't really care, all they transmit is a manifest instructing the client on what to render, at what coordinates and at which orientation.
---
If you want to make helpful suggestions about this or any other game, learn how it works first.
---
Yeah and it looked pretty alien if I remember. Like three eyeholes man. Definitely seemed like how it would be if they reverse engineered power armor imo
---
Is it though? 
---
So they dropped the price or removed the Service? 
---
That's when the joke will be old.
---
Well I mean...we always have adventure mode for casual play, I personally would think the first person to make lvl 50 w/o dying would be proud of that feat.  
---
Oh, it was great other than the fact you were punished for doing well, sad they took it down so soon after removing people from the map (which was its worst feature)
---
THEY'RE par for the course, sadly. All MTXs are similar to this and won't lower until people stop buying them.
---
I'm in the US, im in the eastern timezone as well if that helps any!
---
usually play around 11:30pm est weekdays and on the weekends it's really whenever
---
I carry a sniper rifle mostly but used to carry a shotgun for close quarters.  Used to, as in you're right and I just couldn't afford the what, 18-19 weight.  It was like carrying around a missile launcher.
---
Nah, they need to do as much as they can to upgrade their end, then with those upgrades they can maybe:
---
1 Squeeze more public events at once
---
2 more people which ups the future faction support
---
3 able to increase the play camp budget 
---
4 possibly up the stash limit
---
Totally feel your pain. I could overlook *all* of the game's other failings if they added more of the building assets from Fallout 4, made the building system a little more versatile, added half-foundations or triangle foundations like Ark uses.   
---
Seeing as how they rely so heavily on CAMP items in the Atomic Shop, you'd think they'd put a little more priority into at least increasing the budget, if not improving the building system all around.  But, that's probably an engine limitation too -\_-
---
Oh yeah, NOW we are talking! +1
---
Im doing the same style playthrough actually. Lvl 16ish right now. Its a lot of fun.
---
BTW, one realistic way they could get the budget up is to set aside servers with for players with rigs that can take the load. However, they'd need to test that additional configuration, and it should be obvious by now that they aren't thoroughly testing the existing configurations.
---
Or if ZeniMax further wants to soil Bethesda's name, Fallout 1st
---
ROFL, thats funny...
---
I dont know about the map thing, was the only piece I hated about the OG...
---
Yup, you totally knew that before...
---
Wait tho. Were you on a roof? Cuz roofs are for PvP. ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
The workshops were implemented with the idea of warring over resources. For those that dont want that, the private servers work perfectly for.
---
Why not let it be the general standard that in public serves if you want to pvp claim a workshop?
---
Sounds like NW with extra steps.
---
Don't see why having 1st is "shameful".  When other people pay your bills then, and only then, may they dictate what you spend the money on.
---
That's what we do. So, good plan.
---
The data-mined Power Armor has a lot of similarities to the War Machine poster from the communism poster set.
---
A lot like how the Liberty Prime armor emulates Liberty Prime, I think the communist Power Armor is in the same vein a PA inspired by a much larger walker.
---
Griefers are almost completely neutered by pacifist mode. The use of which rests with the player avoiding PvP. Yes, you argued against yourself.
---
Hunter/Hunted requires a minimum of 4 players to opt in. This might not seem like much, but PvPers are a pretty small minority. I've only participated once, although I've attempted multiple times. It also offers a different experience from random brawls.
---
Pacifist exists as a tool to keep PvP away from those who don't want it. Making this preference easily identifiable seems a natural progression of the idea.
---
You're not the target of the suggestion, so of course it seems unnecessary.
---
Yeah, it's very frustrating.  Even more so that Bethesda doesn't acknowledge it.
---
The condition of the server does play a role in it.  If a server is sufficiently decayed, you start to see the rubber banding on pretty much everything.  Heck, I just did a silo run where my *pistols* were doing it.
---
Delete the Failnight mode, and put survival back. Survival was fine, it just needed minor balancing tweaks, and unlike that other mode that no one asked for, it actually makes sense to have in a Fallout game.
---
Are... Are you fingering your camp?
---
But you said it yourself. Pvpers are a pretty small minority, why would BGS waste time implimenting stuff for it? Thats not a snarky or dickheaded remark even though i am aware it reads like one.
---
I've also seen fewer dropping, so I started doing it myself. It's not too bad running a silo solo. If you're PC, add me. Same IGN as here. I'll take you through the silo and we can launch one together. If you've finished the required quests, of course.
---
Their is a Nuka Cola Freezer that has been data mined and it might have the chill effect for Cola from past games their is also and Nuka Cola fridge but most people  think it's just a skin for the fridge
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with how you spend your money.. they're putting content that should be quest rewards and things behind a paywall to sell more subscriptions. Private servers could have been a cheaper package by itself, but they threw all these in game advantages into it after they said future content would be free.
---
Arguing that there are other atrocities in the world to worry about is just silly. Makes it sound even more stupid to spend money on a videogame rather than donating to cancer research or stopping world hunger etc.. smh
---
Since when? They made stealth armor in reaction to power armor, then nukes dropped, so when did they make this power armor?
---
My camp turrets are great at mowing down kitties
---
I wouldnt be the person going after the level 5 but having been the low level attempting to see what open pvp games are like I can tell you these people exist for this reason only.
---
As for the defense mode in RDR2 it takes like 30 seconds to turn on and off but while its on you cannot hurt other players and they do barely any damage to you. If they really wanted to kill you they would waste all their ammo trying but barely hurt you. They also have a white flag system on the camps that allow you to open your camp to pvp if the white flag is down. Nice systems I think but there is no penalty for dying so people take crazy risks.
---
It's a pain in the ass getting them right, I tell you, use it at your own mental risk...
---
Thanks for your kindness.
---
Yes actually I hunt regularly and own several different kind of arms, and I know duo welding would not be easy or practical but their are way worse examples were fallout is not realistic
---
Then you'd just have all the console players complaining about the 'p2w' PC gamers and how Bethesda is treating the PC's better. (Although I myself wouldn't mind personally because I game on PC and play on Ultra. I would turn it down too high or medium if it meant more camp budget)
---
I would like a pvp gladiator type arena introduced with Wastelanders or from a Raider oriented questline. Maybe not as a replacement, but this would be a fun addition in my opinion.
---
It‚Äôs in the cranberry bog
---
And 10 smg's
---
Smart idea! Think I'll do that for a few, be a nice way to help out some starters thanks for the tip!
---
Survival vs hardcore.  In survival it's just *easier* to die (or in this case, easier to be killed, but I'd be fine with both).  You don't lose the character if you die.
---
I don't think I'd like a hardcore server :P
---
Because, in this case, the change is simple enough to implement as to be profitable, and it benefits the PvE crowd, which is the majority, by alleviating the need for PvP players to engage with them on these grounds. 
---
Bethesda already made the choice to include PvP in this game. Some minor support to make existing systems work better is far from a giant leap.
---
I'm on xbox with 3 star assassins single action revolver with 25% ffr and +1 agi. Maybe you want?
---
Low level mules would have plenty of caps.
---
See, i think itll make it work exactly the same. I dont think it will change anything. Sounds good yes. I agreed several times. I dont think implimenting it will actually make a difference. 
---
But agreed its too far down the list of changes to be made in the next year. Lol.
---
No probs! I like to drop off bags of extraneous plans and recipes. Sometimes grenades and mines. Whatever I have a huge surplus of that noobs might find useful. :)
---
Why would I want to risk losing my stuff when I can sell it in 100% safety from my camp?
---
A small bit of easier access to a random amount of players in the local area does not outweigh the risk of loss, IMO.
---
As VaultTecTG said, it's in the Bog, more specifically south of Watoga, very close to the Fissure Site there.   [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sunrise\_Field](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sunrise_Field)
---
Except for the thing that way more people play NW than people who played survival...
---
You're preaching to the choir, there. That's not how things play out, though. PvE players want to use workshops to grind resources unmolested. This is a big divide in the community.
---
Further, this is a pretty limiting restriction. The best feature of 76 is its large map. Different terrain means different tactics. It makes a world of difference to the PvP experience.
---
Bring back legion pit fights!!!!
---
Maybe this is what made me think of it, haha
---
I read it and the first thing i thought of was fist fighting Benny. Lol.
---
Oh you're talking budget size, I try to stay pretty small, only have budget maxed on 2 characters. I wish they'd add an option to change the camp size and shape, like keep it the same Area size but be able to have it a square or rectangle of various sizes rather than the circle.
---
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Had Slugs and Darts for shotguns as well as buckshot. I feel that STALKER came close to true shotguns.
---
I feel like community divide is why there is so much disappointment with the game, some want to play it as a game, and some want to play it as a story world.
---
Maybe for every successful defend event/contest retention you get a %bonus on items sold? 
---
So like maybe 20/40/60/80/100% bonus so by the fifth one youre getting double caps? Might be exploitable but idk good question, incentive is everything
---
That's an impasse. I think it's a good idea, and you don't. It's all just theory anyway. I doubt Bethesda pays any attention to any of these suggestion threads besides Atom Shop requests.
---
lmao, I'm about to go buy New Vegas again.
---
Because they advertised it to the players of those games, and no one did survival BECAUSE of the balancing issues I mentioned. It would be quite easy to make survival the go to game mode for this game, and again, it would actually make sense, unlike pandering to the armada of tweens that have no idea wtf Fallout is, and only play because of some bs game mode added because of a trend.
---
Pvp pit fights.  Lets bring those in if anything. Lol
---
That's how cities are built, one house at a time. House turns into houses, houses into settlements, settlements into towns, and towns into cities. Rebuilding Appalachia one house at a time.
---
Maybe they developed it in another Mama Dolce's factory
---
I'm inclined to agree with you there. The reality is that this is a game that nobody asked for. I feel its player base is niche for that reason.
---
My guild, the 47th Legion, is pretty active in FO76 on PC. We play every night, usually 3-10 online.
---
Lots of different levels of players too. Have been playing since launch and the guild was originally founded in 2007 so we're not going anywhere.
---
LMK if you're interested and I'll send ya some info.
---
i'm just kidding about it being shameful
---
I doubt it, but hey, Bethesda will retcon anything for a quick buck.
---
I think your analysis is wrong. Completely. Ive been playing fallout since release. 20 years ago. And i love NW. Hated survival with a passion. Not because of the balancing issues either. One could argue that every fallout being single player up until 76, that pvp is a pandering game mode as well.
---
Just like the x01, could be just a prototype. There‚Äôs a gazillion ways to fit anything into the ‚Äòlore‚Äô if they want to. It definitely just worksüëå
---
Agree fully, I've tried this before myself.  It's awesome keeping your armor perks.  Just didn't want OP to think he could do this and just chill in the nuke zone picking flowers.
---
Guess OP should also know power armor has a hidden DR percentage too.  Even if you get your DR/ER values bumped to match power armor with Bolstering or Vanguard's, you will still take more damage than if in power armor.  Don't remember the numbers for sure but it's like 4-7 percent reduction per power armor piece or something.
---
Even though all the nice hidden reductions are there, I still prefer running normal armor for those sweet legendary effects!!
---
Toxic lake is a great place for that, we had 8players over there at one ooint
---
It was on gamepass. Idk if it still is.
---
Some more events couldn't hurt. Monster Mash is pretty much it. There used to be a civil war event of some kind that I haven't seen in ages. Not sure what happened there.
---
Just like they retconned the NCR huh?
---
Yup, they'll retcon anything for a quick buck.
---
I'm pretty sure you can mod a 10mm pistol to replicate its functionality, ideally with one of the Legendary perks related to VATS.
---
Its visual... well... they'll probably sell it to you down the line and say "the community demanded it." üòã
---
I think it was just you vs robots. I think they could drop the requirement on hunter/hunted down to 2 ppl instead of 4. That might satisfy the pvp crowd for a bit.
---
Same here. Also love giving newbies Nukashine.
---
I recall the talk about making it season based. It makes a ton of sense and solves a lot of the complaints people had about previous Survival mode. They should probably revert of massive damage cap of the final iteration though. Otherwise it ends up being a race to the railway rifle.
---
Yup....and super mutants, the X-01, making a power armor skin of Liberty Prime, a VERY secret, half built prototype, and many other things.....
---
Try r/76market.
---
I just have a set of excavator for mining ore veins, very rarely do I use it anywhere else
---
IGN: Zacrynix
---
Feel free to add me. :)
---
That just makes it worse lol.
---
HAHAHA! Now that‚Äôs just downright evil. :D
---
I doubt it would be released sooner than Wastelanders, most of the work is now focused on the overhaul, and it is probably too different by now from the "legacy" (currently public) branch of the game, which makes it difficult to back port major changes. I suspect the balance changes could also be unpopular with some people if introduced on their own, better save them for when there is a large content drop and the new legendary player system as well, these are likely meant to work together as one package.
---
Unfortunately, Chameleon doesn't make you less visible to AIs.  Only players.
---
Wait until they add camp budget to fallout 1st, maybe you'll be able to pay to make the big camps you want. üò¥
---
I dunno, the big retcon between Fallout 1 and Fallout 2 means that the lore was always malleable and subject to change
---
"As a Fallout 1st¬†member, you‚Äôll have access to exclusive discounts in the Atomic Shop, so not only are you getting bonus Atoms every month, you‚Äôll get discounts on some sweet items to spend those Atoms on."
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce
---
The page for Fallout First has been updated multiple times since release, but when they first launched it and sent out the press releases it clearly said that there would be exclusive discounts in the atom shop.
---
There's something to be said for wading into enemies in full power armor, gatling plasma blazing, ghouls and Scorched literally melting all around you.
---
Can you?
---
Maybe it shouldn't automatically remove it when you put it on!
---
Id rather just sell my ammo for caps.
---
You can use a hazmat suit, that's what I prefer anyway, PA is clunky. I second using excavator for ore gathering. It's a level 25 quest down in the ash heap to get the plans Miner Miracles
---
Well they could make other shades of lib prime for quick bucks too, why the extra work for a new model. it‚Äôs probably more about diversifying the game world than just quick bucks.
---
I've complained about this on PC.
---
I got a lot of backlash from PS4 players saying they didn't have issues.
---
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
You can get by in a Nuke Zone in a HazMat Suit by relying on perk card defenses like Ironclad, Bandolier, Lone Wanderer, Blocker, and Evasive.  If you're Bloodied, staples like Serendipity and Dodgy will also help you avoid or blunt incoming damage.
---
I‚Äôve noticed as well it‚Äôs like a straight line throughout a portion of your build...
---
No those are there for safety, dude
---
thats how I felt w/ f4's settlement such before modding.. the tools are very much needed for creative freedom
---
I swear to Christ, if they do that then I'm gonna lose my shit.
---
So basically a .38 dump?
---
The abrupt damage cut-off seems to be unnecessary, shotguns already have a low range stat to begin with, and their effectiveness at range is reduced by the pellet spread. But other weapons like rifles still deal useful damage from far away, while with a shotgun it can go from virtually zero damage to one-shotting an enemy in like one meter.
---
It says the community is unavailable?
---
Create custom games and lobbies.  TDM, Hardpoint, Domination......basically copy a Call of Duty multiplayer set up.  Include custom load outs,  bots/no bots...etc.  Another game that comes to mind is Stronghold Crusader....that game is so much fun.....something like that but Fallout 76.  
---
Give us fully custom PVP game modes.
---
They already are, they said they'll be improving 1st and this was one of those "improvements"
---
From that title i hope youre wife isnt cheating on you...
---
They just literally made a slightly different color of that skin, just for that.....just saying.
---
Exactly, Truth is constantly being revealed irl, Retcon is totally fine in games.
---
The lucky people will always get the upper hand.  I can't comment on the damage cap, or anything related to PvP really, so I'll take your word for that.
---
I think that they just didn't have the technology ready to do all this.  It makes sense, is more fair, and they *did* bring it up first.  The only real reason I can think of that they didn't end up doing it are 1) they couldn't figure out how to get it to happen, or 2) they got pulled off to do other things.
---
They have always said it was a beta, so either of those would make sense, in that they didn't have it set up the way they *wanted* to, and then couldn't finish up (and pulled it because it was a shit show without the changes).
---
That‚Äôs exactly what i was referring to. That‚Äôs literally quick bucks.
---
Can you link me it?
---
It'll be right under the tent image. 
---
Ah, yeah, thought you didn't know about it, and were making an argument that they don't do that lol.
---
Yep. I give them guns, armor, and a bottle.
---
Lol, quite a few times people come out and see a bag. Then take just the Nukashine and vanish... Leaving the ammo, gun, and armor.
---
Welcome to the wasteland.
---
Why so toxic? The only thing that I said that was "wrong" is that I forgot that that amazon runs the servers. AND from personal work I know that an upgrade of RAM server side would allow more to be done. Why would more RAM on the server side have a negative affect on the client?
---
Upping the RAM is upgrading on their side.
---
Thanks.
---
I just lost all hope.
---
How would you do that? They would have to scan your rig and then place you into a server with those like you. The client side is not the issue, the servers need upgrading
---
The og had longest life, personally I loved the most kills varient as it meant the pvp crowd could find each other
---
Well, we know who the alkies are now. LOL
---
Server-side ram isn't the bottleneck. GPU rendering is.
---
Amazon likely has servers with more RAM available.  Bethesda isn't going to rent those until it has to.
---
We're sorry, but requests cost 20,000 atoms. Only 19,999 atoms with Fallout 1st!
---
\-Bethesda Development Team
---
Tamed animals can't be killed by players unless PVP is engaged.  
---
Player enters area and triggers enemy spawns. Enemies attack camp and petis killed by enemies. Player then kills enemies.
---
Tamed wolves die very quickly, due to their extremely low HP.
---
Thanks but I recently got an instigating explosive one.
---
Oh no they‚Äôve been doing this all the time for quick bucks (different shades of excavator tooü§Æ) i was just saying from the leaked image it‚Äôs an entirely different geometry, so it more about the diversification than quick bucks.
---
Lol wouldnt doubt it!
---
Yea preach. Had some guys give me armor and meds when I started playing. Now I try to do the same when I come across new folks
---
Does it say how often you'd get those discounts?
---
Been there on Xbox since the free week, overall pretty positive community, even after Beth killed the Survival mode...
---
Maybe the range of shotguns could also vary by the type of the weapon, for example, a pump action with long barrel could have better range than a combat shotgun, to make up for the low fire rate. That way, the pump action does not become obsolete around level 20-30.
---
For leveling, is ammo scarcity enough of a reason to do Gunslinger first? Or is pistol ammo common enough?
---
It used to at least, if they "fixed" that I'll be a wee bit bummed
---
I haven't played for a month or so and went to the Purveyor and rolled a bloodied Gatling gun for my bloodied build lol I was like omg and walked out with a smile on my face lol I stopped and didn't roll anymore.. I have like 600 scrip left over. I might go tonight and check it out..
---
Not that I‚Äôm aware of.
---
Sadly, the game engine will not support that so I would not expect to ever it happen.
---
No we are not...
---
There is nothing different between the public &amp; private servers regarding build budgets.
---
This really branched off and got out of hand...we need to get back to the root of the problem.
---
No, but we do have our own robot butler that retrieves legendaries for us.
---
But that is what it seems to be indicating under the tent image: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/3r1YDnDtyO1CtNFbJX6RBJ/fallout-76-fallout-1st-announce
---
You honestly can't imagine how a game that selects which graphics mode to use based on your PC's specs might relay that information to the server? That's rich with ignorance right there.
---
The servers may need upgrading - but that isn't going to help the camp budget in any appreciable way.
---
No one knows yet, except for Bethesda.  Currently, FO1st members aren't getting a bigger build budget.  That's coming in the future.  As to how much bigger, or how that'll work with public worlds, we can't really say.
---
Heh heh, probably.
---
How are you punished for using them?
---
The "damage bug" is on Bethesda's [official list of known issues](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/319566/fallout-76-known-issues-and-feedback?language=en).
---
Last I checked the bolt-action and auto/semi still did.  Pipe-revolvers never benefited, from what I recall...
---
Never thought about it that way, lol.
---
Private servers are smaller, for what it's worth (limit 8 people). It's useful for resource gathering, but it isn't as much fun.
---
Was there ever any pictures from this supposed datamine?  I'd love to see what it looks like before banking atoms.
---
I can testify that Pipe Revolvers definitely do, currently.  As long as you mod them to have a rifle stock.
---
Apparently so.  Well, their fix ain't working.
---
Oh cool!   I've been away a while, did they ever adjust the Legendary tables for pipe-revolvers then?
---
If I recall correctly, it is the revolver that benefits, and not the pipe gun.
---
No, it didn't. Bethesda was actually pretty vague about it, which was probably a CYA thing in case they changed their mind, but it is why people are confused. There is also fine print saying that the bonuses will be temporary, so most people assumed they'd at least do monthly rewards especially since there are a bunch of variants of the outfit already created just waiting to be released.
---
To be fair, the point of workshops is to 'encourage' pvp.  Beating up people 300 levels below you is rather pointless though.
---
At higher levels, people shouldn't 'need' to take over a workshop for ammo/materials, though not everyone is resourceful when it come to that stuff.  As someone approaching level 300, I have never gotten a single resource from a workshop, and I get by just fine.  People who take workshops from low levels are usually either lazy, or just like beating up on helpless players.
---
IMO, especially as a new player...as much as workshops would help you, I'd avoid them, or at least don't rely on them to be self-sufficient.  They're a risk, but if you stash all your junk before trying them, the worst that will happen is that you'll waste a little time.
---
Assault rifle and minigun arent bad
---
In what way?
---
It's what makes the game work. There were a lot of people that helped me out when I started. Even giving me full sets of fully modded PA which I still use. I try to do the same when I see new people in game or drop items in world containers at the Vault 76, Overseer's camp, Flatwoods or the Rail Station/Airport at Morgantown. Always leaving plans/recipes &amp; supplies.
---
Pipe revolvers definitely double dip üëçüèª rested it firsthand and very recently myself
---
Oh, I live in Europe. Unfortunately, the Ping would be too high :(
---
Yeah, my guess is NW and Wastelanders are their primary focus. Even after stopping work on Survival mode, they still had to delay Wastelanders until next year.
---
As for my opinion on lucky drops, I think the better player will trump a lucky drop. Those with good builds, knowledge of game quests and mechanics, and good aim will beat out someone with a "lucky" legendary drop.
---
*NEVER* assume anything about what BGS says.  Read it in the worst possible light you can imagine, and you'll probably be right...but they also lie outright, so take that into consideration too.
---
It does not read it well, there are many other factors other than just your basic hardware. If it relied any more on the client, wouldn't that also lead to even MORE cheat systems? It is too risky.
---
They double dip, but pipe weapons are crap damage to start so it's a waste of perk cards.
---
For reference, a Fixer deals 48 damage at level 50, while a pipe gun is good for 26.  So the fixer will deal 91 damage with 9 perk cards, and the pipe gun deals 73 damage with 18 perk cards. This is not a good deal.
---
Sure but why make it worse?
---
As a guy who also runs a bloodied commando build, I would say anything but 5.56 is pretty common. I do tend to find more 10mm ammo in vendors over everything else however.
---
Why so much if you are trying to un load them
---
Well, way back when...  there were NO Legendary pipe revolvers available at all.
---
Aquaboy/girl. I altered my main character in Adventure mode just so I could use this perk (he only had 2 END) and hoo boy, is it ever awesome. I've survived many more minutes than I probably should have just afk hiding at the bottom of the lake above Grafton, immune to the rads and not needing air while folks kill each other on the shores around me, oblivious to the naked man underwater twiddling his thumbs until the storm forces me to move
---
Bethesda clearly expected everyone to go full raider, and were shocked. to quote Todd himself from last E3- "We created a hostile post-apocalypse, and everyone's nice to each other!" i remember when they added a challenge that required healing someone in water, they were shocked that some people would JUMP OFF CLIFFS INTO SHALLOW RIVERS so others could complete it lol.
---
every game has assholes, but 76 definitely has the most overall friendly community.
---
You haven't played Nuclear Winter much have you?  Fallout is a hacker's dream precisely because way too much is offloaded onto the client and the servers are there primarily to coordinate the clients and serve as gatekeepers to inventory management. Considering the game is a converted single player game that shouldn't be surprising.
---
No shit, but dual wielding pistols is super idiotic no matter what. At least super mutants are believable within their own context.
---
The quad radium rifle is OK.  Furious Minigun is pretty decent.  
---
I landed a Furious Minigun this morning with explosive effect and VATS.  Added shredder to it and might keep it in my stash.
---
Sounds like a ringing endorsement of my suggestion!  With my idea, these players you so despise would be more able to find like minded people to engage with and you can be left in peace.
---
Productive! If you build in known nuke zones you better be prepared to get nuked!
---
This is why you need to share the perk - this way all party mates have it and all gain the benefit.  
---
The perk only heals rads on other teammates, never yourself, and thus "in a party and near your teammates".
---
The pieces you had before were probably heavy pieces. Combat armor has 3 different types. Light, Sturdy and Heavy and the damage/energy resistance is different for each type.
---
Its proven that working together gets more done than just taking everything that others do. Fallout 4 literally teaches you this lesson.
---
Lol thief
---
Yeah dude. I'm not sure where the stacking stops, but my weapon mule is a pure build. Every weapon weight compressing armour and perk possible. Its virtually infinite storage. Fat man's drop to like 0.22 lbs. Rifles have the least compression and they go to like 1.x lbs. 
---
I'm  getting way more than 90% weight reduction
---
Yes, they drop as Legendary.
---
My gunslinger's main weapon is a Bloodied one and that thing hits quite hard.
---
What if I told you there are already people roleplaying survivors from outside of the vault in the game right now?
---
Do you really think that every one of our characters became a general in the US and launched a nuke for the enclave too?
---
If you can find an All Star Basketball, those sell well too. I sold one for 176 caps, and one for 576 caps...when I come across another one, I'm gonna try for 1076 and see if it goes. The do look pretty nice in a display case, and I've only seen those three in all my time playing...haven't been specifically looking for them either tho, so they might not be rare at all
---
i have definitely discovered it and noticed it didn't show up on my compass the other day as well.  I was headed over there to pick cranberries and was kinda not really paying attention to what direction i was going until i was there and curious as to if i was actually at some other place on the map but nope.  Was kind of wondering what other places were not showing up.
---
Thanks. Will look into this.
---
To add to this, metal, robot, and leather are the same way.
---
it's all good :)
---
Oh how right this post proved to be. No one believes p2w would get worse and that this was a silly oversight. Now we have fo1st
---
Not an entirely accurate statement.  Part of the build theory of the perk card system is the diminishing returns of assigning more than one perk card per category of perk.  For example, the first perk card assigned to a given weapon type damage boost like Rifleman or Gunslinger is always a better 'bang-for-buck' than the subsequent second and third cards.  So if you were looking at more well-rounded build that didn't dump every perk slot into damage, you could double-dip in pipe weapons and spend 1 card slot into Rifleman, Expert RM, Master RM, Gunslinger, Expert GS, Master GS, for a total of 6 cards expended and a gain of +60% damage gain as opposed to say 9 cards allocated in purely Rifleman for +60% gain.
---
Sorry about the nomenclature, I meant the Disney thing
---
Lol, right. I personally am not surprised, half of their release problems could have been solved with proper PR that actually was transparent instead of vague half truths that they change their mind on after the fact. Then again I also canceled my sub because it doesn't offer enough for what it costs to keep me interested. And I suspect I'm not the only one. The price is too high for the limited implementation of private worlds, the scrapbox should be in the main game and you can buy atoms on their own.
---
In my experience, it is quite possible to avoid death for very long times. I think something like allowing one death per level could be reasonable, although it might be exploited by grinding some "safe" activity for the rest of the level (which could be addressed with some XP adjustments). Also, in a hypothetical "hardcore" mode, the focus would ideally be less on grind, making it less of a punishment to start a new character. On the other hand, my impression is that grinding and one very long playthrough (never having to create another character - I recall from an old Pete Hines interview that replayability is a forbidden word in the studio, or something like that) are core design goals of the game, which the developers will not give up on.
---
I addressed them removing the references to discounts.
---
Ahhh well they‚Äôve definitely got legendaries now. I have an aae and aaffr both 2 star that r sitting on my trade list. And an aa5025 that I use
---
No, the problem I‚Äôve got is a 2080 Ti and a 1080 Ti, and no mater the windows, Nvidia or INI edit the game runs on the 1080Ti.  
---
Only ‚Äò76 does this, out of 18+ games, not even FO4 does it.  
---
  
---
Some of us have a theory this is an un-admitted to change, the game running on GPU1 vs GPU0, because Fallout ‚Äò76, unlike FO4 or other games,‚Äôdoesn‚Äôt have tons of posts about it running on the integrated GPU
---
Yeah i can feel the lag and framerate drop even at the thought of casting a eye in the direction of 8 player camps at max budget clustered in one small area.
---
It'd be awesome, but the game just can't hack it currently.
---
The stats for unmodded combat armor 
---
Light chest piecss are 36/36 
---
Heavy chest pieces are 61/61 
---
Light limbs are 12/12
---
Sturdy limbs are 15/15
---
Heavy limbs are 20/20
---
Yeah, then was changed to top 3 most xp gained...PVP could be facilitated in other ways, for instance in ESO the real ballers go 1 v 1 somewhere and dont ever bother with nubs, unless they stumble into the wrong fight...if that crowd had really wanted it vs. just being LB scrubs, they could have made it happen.
---
Those things were _less_ useful and interesting than even that damn Atom Store Vault Boy cutout. 13c for 1 308?!
---
I think I must be playing the game wrong. I'm level 44 and I still find enemies that scare me.
---
Now god knows I can‚Äôt dual wield but you ever seen on of those old gun shows were the one dude can hit 5 clay pigeons with 2 revolvers. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs practical and the average man could not do it but with a lot of practice and coordination it is possible
---
They do and so does the pipe bolt action pistol, for the highest damage in the game next to like the dragon
---
to be fair a level 300 has no stat difference over a level 50 either. One just has spent more time playing and might have better guns but the level 50 could just has well have that gear.
---
Compass is still not perfect, especially as quest icons increase.
---
This happens on crappy serves, for me. I jump server, and voila.
---
Have fun.  you asked about defending.  I'd check your camp and see if it ever gets attacked.  there are tons of places you can build that will never get attacked and you don't have to ever worry about defending.  There may be a rare event that brings something to your camp but in general they are mostly safe.  
---
don't bother taking over a workshop right now unless you are playing in a private world.
---
Most players are generally nice.  you may find people willing to donate things.  If you are on xbox I can probably drop you a bunch of aid items as i'm looking to change up some of my perks and get rid of some weight reduction perks.  I really don't need 230 stimpacks
---
That‚Äôs pretty tight! I just got an aa2525 pipe bolt action. I‚Äôll have to give it a modding and then a go
---
Mind if I join you? I have a keycard and haven't used it yet because it seems you need a dedicated group. I've attended multiple times and they've all failed because no one seems to know what to do
---
Oh yeah, eventually, one of these days, when it happens, SOON as the fully customizable modded private servers drop I have big plans for my world too!!!
---
That is my point, I am saying there should be more work server side.
---
Lol my pipe revolver gun does something over 200 damage and my bolt action pipe pistol is like 340, VE 2 star. check you numbers, they are wrong.
---
yea some arent bad at all. others eh. going to to some trading hopefully
---
Design around limitations.
---
Sounds like you rolled light/regular combat armour rather than the Sturdy or Heavy equivalents?
---
That's the way I think. Let's be honest, this game has taken place over hundreds of years, and almost every historical fact has moved from one coast to another by word of mouth.  Just look at how baseball is described in Diamond City. Retcons are just more of "the truth" being revealed.
---
My quad shows over 3500 floating damage, but actual damage to the target deathclaw was trivial.  Other people reported similar this week.  Test it out on something and let me know if yours works right.
---
hahahaha awesome! yea its a good feeling when you see an awesome roll!
---
Sure, at Lv. 44.
---
You don't have access to the best gear and perks until after Lv. 50.
---
yea i thought the same
---
Thatd be awesome! On xbox im: x Killer Tofu x. Give me an add we can hook up. Thanks!
---
I have a 3* instigating pipe bolt action rifle with the right set of perk cards that hits for easily over 1800+ dmg while sneaking
---
As it is a common trope in all visual media, especially the westerns that Fallout regularly pulls from, I would say that no matter how "stupid" YOU think that it is it's popularity AS a trope is pretty high.
---
Sort of feel like this could have been what happened with workshops - make them a collaborative effort to build up over time and investing raw materials in building gets you rewards of deliveries of raw materials they produce.
---
Are the any advantages for using light or sturdy over heavy? Except for having less weight...
---
Will do.
---
Those are just the base damage, not including receiver mods, the bloody mess perk, legendary effects, and so on. But the number of 26 is also for the basic (semi-)auto pipe gun, not the revolver or bolt-action.
---
Would love to join you guys. I have a keycard myself, so we can run it an extra time if y'all want. I'm antisocial by nature, so it would be my first time joining a group, and don't actually know how to do so...I'm a 1st'er as well, so we could use my private world if that would be better?
---
I'm with you, only 1acconnt though, but 5 toons, no mules. Love the versatility of having 5 different builds. Would love to have more to play with, even just one more slot would rock. Maybe a cheap one time fee to add a new slot?
---
It took a little over a week after my paid month was over for the option to subscribe to work.
---
During this week+ I was still able to access Private World, but didn't receive the atoms. I used PayPal for the original purchase and during that week I'd receive MS message asking if I wanted to add a new payment option to re sub FO1st.
---
update: been playing for a few days now, having fun but still a lot of the same issues with frame rate drops, lag and all that but I'm still enjoying it. At lvl40. Today some guy came by my camp and just dropped a bunch of stuff for me and did a gift emote. He gave me a bunch of plans, recipes, ultracite stuff, power armor mods, a t51 jetpack mod. Guy just came and gave it away  I was shocked tbh.
---
Sone kind of PvP beacon you could set and then defend for caps/exp is a great idea.
---
And I have an Instigating Gauss that hits for over 4000, your point?
---
Worked.  Lol
---
I just wish theyd allow us to make CAMPS in some of the abandoned open buildings. There is more then a few spots that have a premade home or building with no spawn point and low enemy spawns and I always wished I could make a CAMP there. Taking outposts is fun but comes with the danger of PVP and im personally more into just decorating buildings then actually making buildings on Fallout. Like Diamond City apartment was my favorite place in Fallout 4, and the Minutemen castle. I barely built anything there but decorate it immaculately.
---
I do the same thing, except I use bourbon or whiskey instead of a normal brew for my 2 non nukashine.
---
I had a friend come through a few days ago, not realizing it was full of nuka, and drank the whole bowl.
---
He spent the next 10 minutes moving from Nukashine location to Nukashine location.
---
Each nukashine has its own timer, and they will all go off. 
---
Great way to catch that friend that comes to your base and takes all your locked resources.
---
He learned his lesson.
---
Yeh i was also being able to go in private and use tent/scrap box as wel a couple more days.il try again tomorrow.thx for answering
---
Nuka Dark is the only cola you can put in it.
---
I don't understand, how are they cancerous? It's nice to have a concentration of vendors to peruse, and it is kinda funny to watch them log out for nukes, like roaches when you turn on the lights.
---
Online games are broken into 2 distinct components, a server side program and a client side program.  Each part of those 2 things handles different aspects of the game.  
---
fo76 was built and designed as an online game.  It can't "just" be made single player, as this would require a completely new game without distinctly separate server and client programs.  An entirely new game would take a long time to build even if a lot of the assets can be ported over.
---
Its going to be replaced with wastelander content and faction stuff
---
I just camp near the vault, put them in my vendor machine and set the price at 0 caps.
---
Lol it cures your withdrawal, not your addiction. Your addiction effect is the return of withdrawals as soon as the vodka perks wear off.
---
I do like the membership. Just got it over the weekend. Other than launching a nuke on private, it's pretty nice.
---
[Sure, here's one](https://i.imgur.com/yBkhu6y.jpg)
---
According to the datamines it's called "Red Shift Power Armor" and it talks like the Liberty Prime skin, except instead of American jingoism it's Chinese
---
yeah i've started uploading my good photos to xbox live by taking a screenshot with the home button so i don't lose them.  I reinstalled one time to hopefully make the game run smoother and it might have helped for like a week.
---
Fallout 76: W.O.W edition.
---
Typically we use the private server for nukes. When it comes to events like encrypted or queen drops it's better to use a public for more people to join. I don't know our exact number but I think we are sitting on roughly 7 cards right now. Either way I'm just waiting to hear from my group to start running them. Just shoot me a friend request and your welcome to join us.
---
Hahahahahhah , well done good sir or madam
---
Well played, you sneaky fuck.
---
Send me a message as well so I can link the GT to the raids cause I get a lot of friend requests.
---
I'm in a discord and people there would probably play with you
---
Just added you,  I'm wahoo I'll probably be on tonight (9pm eastern or so)
---
Maybe check if you do indeed have pacifist on, you shouldn't get killed by people at all with it on unless it's a PvP event like monster mash. 
---
Sorry for not really answering the question
---
Instanced, faction based pvp within adventure mode that influences the main map.
---
So for example maybe there's a "settlers vs raiders" pvp instance.  Players opt in and pick a team, and from there it works like other PvP games (CTF, base assault, last man standing, objective based, etc).
---
When one side wins, their faction gains control of one of the many abandoned checkpoints throughout the adventure mode map and perhaps there's some other PvE benefits like allied players get discounted prices at faction vendors or similar.
---
This would turn the entire PvE vs PvP player conflict upside down: PvP players would have an outlet with open pvp vs other players that have opted in similar to NW, and PvE players would actually be ROOTING for the pvp players in their faction to win the battles as opposed to feeling like these bad evil pvp players are only there to grief people.
---
In 4 it was described as a unique pre-war prototype, meaning other Deliverers might exist but it never entered full production.
---
They might add it later down the line but I guess they figured it was too similar to the existing 10mm Pistol. Or too unique in Fallout 4 like the Laser Muskets. Or something.
---
To add even more, they also all have different appearances.
---
If only there was a system in adventure mode where PVP players could sign up to fight each other....hunt each other is you will...maybe a radio station or something....
---
The junkies are the backbone of fallout economy.
---
That's not gonna happen if you don't link your discord first.
---
only stuff you built yourself
---
Have to buy mods at modus. You might have to server hop to find them in the vendor.
---
Yea they certainly do bro I hate when you have a full set and one or 2 light pieces it's ruins it ha. At least with marine and scout it's always proportionate!
---
I can dm you it but you can't post discord links on the subreddit
---
So half a cap?
---
Thx!
---
But i have to admit, it looks much nicer than my home....
---
You‚Äôre welcome, happy hunting.
---
You have to complete enclave quest line to get access to the military wing vendor. Then you buy the mods from there. They can get pricey for the polymer one.
---
OMG!   That three-eyed visor is straight out of Armored Trooper VOTOMs!  I love it!  I'll have to keep checking back for when that comes in game...   I still haven't reinstalled yet, was planning on getting my inventory cleaned soon when I do.  Hopefully the Stash sized increased again from when I last played.
---
No plans.  Have to buy the mods from the whitesprings bunker.
---
Agreed. The biggest issue with pistols is that they require points in agility for damage. That‚Äôs a maximum 15 points to spend on damage, covert ops, gun fu, adrenaline, action boy, sneak, and escape artist.
---
Rifles builds can use all of these perks plus the added range and silencers. Anything a pistol can do can be done much better with a rifle.
---
You can find Hazmat suits at the nuclear power plants, the chemical plant over in the Mire, and a few of the mines in the Ash Heap.
---
To quote Monty Python, *"It's a question of weight ratios..."*  :-)
---
I hit for around 1500-1800 with my old pipe rifle too, and it was lighter and cheaper to maintain than my friend who ran a gauss rifle.  Everyone's got a different priority of what they look for in a weapon.
---
Not very.  It drops a grenade from your inventory at your feet.  And if you have life saving armor on, you can potentially blow yourself up.
---
You, dear Sir, won!
---
Pistols difficult? I don't know if it's just me being skilled with pistols but pistols have been the best weapon for me. In every game.
---
All are welcome as far as I am concerned - I expect that many hands make light work???   My PSN is Woodchuck
---
I‚Äôm sure pacifist is on. I was using a Tesla rifle and an explosive LMG, and I think that when they hit another player, in some cases that player can retaliate. The same thing happened during Meat Week, when after one of the Prime Cuts events, a player one-shot me after my Tesla hit him.
---
Well this ain't Fallout 4 bro üò≠ in the wasteland of West Virginia you take what you need or it gets taken from you.
---
Except you can't place camps close enough together to even make something considered a neighborhood
---
Sweet, I may have to look for a Bloodied Explosive Pipe Revolver, as I want a lightweight non-auto .45 sniper to replace my Fixer at some point.
---
Or like the cryolator..oh wait..lol
---
Scout armor mods are sold at the vendor inside modus (in the military wing, not production).  
---
The vendor always has 3 of each mod for each peice of scout armor.  There is no server hopping necessary.
---
The mods can be pricy for the top end stuff, but they are all there, anything you want, even dense.
---
Nice. I'm there thx!
---
That‚Äôs a good point about the life saving armor.
---
So what you're saying is they removed references to one of the selling points AFTER people had subscribed. Something that is, not legal
---
The funny thing is I rarely sold anything from that vendor. I was thinking about emptying it. I'm glad I didn't.
---
Show us!!! Hehe!
---
You have a future on YouTube
---
Yeah. Why don't we get a Redbox for Holotapes and Pipboy games while were at it?
---
oh
---
Looks like the armor's based on this propaganda: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Poster?file=Fo4-us-communism-propaganda.jpg
---
I messaged you
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
How are you not!???
---
Buy a billboard?  Use it?  
---
Lose 1/3 your camp budget. 
---
Fuck that.
---
Lol sure but even with hvh there's something about spontaneous pvp that is just different.
---
Pc.  And crashes and total computer lockup‚Äôs are a constant thing now.
---
Well maybe it just on that server, and when you leave it takes the building out and opens that spot up for building for another player. It was be like a shared build space.
---
good for you man, Always glad to see other players on a come up
---
This. My framerate is about to drop to 1 from my current 5fps lol
---
lol , yeah you ain't been playing fallout very long
---
1. I never Trade directly with people, so I don't know.
---
2. Not a problem for me.  I did a couple horde events last night that went just fine.
---
3. Also not a problem for me.  I don't usually have a headset plugged into the controller.
---
I have, however, seen the re-emergence of several old bugs which had been either fixed or minimized.  Lately I've been experiencing my head completely disappearing, neon-looking texture effects after killing ghouls, turrets shooting other camp objects, and probably other things that I'm forgetting at the moment.  Fun times.
---
1350 Base for the Polymer.
---
In all honesty, i like the generosity of the community i really do, but sometimes it feels like people are "hunting" low level players to dump stuff on. I get that you guys are trying to help. Just be careful what youre giving them. We still want new players to play through and enjoy the game. We dont wanna OP them at lvl 11 ya know? 
---
Like for instance, when i drop a care package, its 5-10 stims, some radaway' a decent pipe pistol, a decent hunting rifle, and maybe 200 rounds of ammo for each, maybe some recipes for some stuff.
---
But i try to stay away from plans and legendaries. Most of these guys are alt characters and have access to all that OP stuff anyway. I just try to give low levels a little boost and thats it.
---
Excellent. I'm Unholy\_Camel, I should be able to get online around that time...I'm bad at time zones, you're looking to run these around 3.5 hours from now, yes?
---
To be even more fair, The higher level will most likely have better perks too because of more packs and more points to level them.
---
Good fences make good neighbors....
---
The build circle is about 1-1/2 the diameter of the base of a power transmission line tower.  That's really not overly large...that kind of spacing is tight for "rural" neighborhoods.   typical in the suburbs, and rather spacious for city apartment dwellers....
---
Bloodied will be the most powerful, followed by the Furious.
---
The TSE is the last of them in both price and power. 
---
The prices follow the usefulness.  Bloodied will be super pricy.  Furious will be pricy, and TSE will be a bargain compared to the other 2.
---
Even for the TSE, expect to spend decent caps.  People still want TSE, so its priced for demand. 
---
The TSE you might be able to find for under 10k.
---
The furious will be 10K+
---
The bloodied you might be able to find for less than 30k, but  most bloodied explosive stuff will be trade only.
---
I like your idea with two provisos. No permadeath. But mainly, no legendaries and no level specific weapon damages. Make it like nuclear winter where everybody fights on an even level
---
Add me to the list of people willing to help. Xbox 1. Byellets x717x.
---
Yeah that was our scheduled time.
---
I'd wager the problem is local (or most of the problems anyway), I'd be looking at your drivers for a lot of things (mostly graphics and sound, but there are a few other possibilities).  
---
Nothing the game does should be locking up your whole computer, that's usually hardware (unlikely, PSU if anything) or drivers.  Updates can exacerbate the issues, but generally won't *cause* those kinds of problems.
---
But you aren't talking about spontaneous PVP, you are talking about looking for people with specific tags. We had an entire game mode devoted to "spontaneous" PVP. It didn't go well.
---
Make a big square. Split it into 10 plots, all the same size and shape. You'll spawn into whichever plot is free. None of the 10 free? You get the current message to swap servers.
---
This issue with pistols is that they are outclassed by rifles in every way. There isn‚Äôt any reason you would want a pistol over a rifle unless you like the aesthetic.
---
Pistols also have the their damage perk cards in agility, which limits the amount of stealth/VATS perks you can run at once. Rifle builds can run max damage perks and and also use up to 15 points in action boy, adrenaline, sneak, escape artist, gun fu, covert ops, and mister sandman. Pistol builds have to use up some of those points for damage perks.
---
So while you are offline the server would have to save all of your progress and build items. Taxing on the server but with a limited server size doable sure
---
&gt;basic (semi-)auto pipe gun, not the revolver or bolt-action.
---
Being that this discussion is about the capacity to double-dip of the Revolver/ Bolt-action. Why bring up the pipe gun.
---
Or just add an ammo converter. Or an ammo press. Or be able to break down ammo into lead g powder and steel.
---
How's that different to now though? If I log off it saves my camp and progress. The difference is I'm not on a random lead node; I'm in one of the 10 plots.
---
But that's not happening here at all, you're arguing against your own cause.
---
It‚Äôs very sad, don‚Äôt see why we can‚Äôt chill them or even make flavours like in nuka world! 
---
You can‚Äôt steal nuka cola as anyone‚Äôs machines will always be empty
---
actually you get debuffed by level gap so a lvl 300 can be murdered by a lvl 15 pretty easily its why a lot of dedicated pvpers run low build characters with bloodied weapons cause you can kill a lvl 300 in the best armor in game with a handful of bullets while they can barely hurt you in return
---
I wasn't around for the Liberty Prime skin, did that apply across all PA types or just certain ones?
---
I kind of agree and disagree. Currently I wield a bloodied 10mm pistol that is REALLY good for stealth. I could take out the entirety of Westek  and not provoke a single mutant. On their own, pistols are extremely weak but with a fully modified legendary with the right perks and you‚Äôll be souring through a hoard in minutes. Pistols are generally good depending on the mods and how you use them. The 10mm I talked about was good at open engagement situations and stealth but revolvers are extremely weak and aren‚Äôt good at stealth. Even if you are a melee build, it is still extremely powerful (albeit with unyielding armor on). I agree with you that most pistols are very weak but they do need a real buff like you said (like the duel wielding mechanic you mentioned) but with damage. 
---
Anyway that was a good read, I think that your ideas where pretty neat!üëç
---
The trade bug in annoying, but ive only ever had it happen between fire team members. So we usually just go somewhere safe and drop bags. Its annoying, but there is a work around. 
---
The horde events, i have not experienced because i so rarely do events. I could care leas about collectable plans and glowing suits. 
---
I do get the sound glitch a lot, and its really annoying. Sometimes fast travelling fixes it. Mine never goes the whole way out though. It just sounds muddled. Like im underwater. So i can still kind of hear stuff coming and am able to work around it. 
---
Although these issues have "work around" methods, it doesnt excuse the fact that theyve been in game for a while now.
---
 Where do you think I learned? ;)
---
I got one once from the purveyor.  BE and something dumb like weight reduction.
---
Sold it for something over 20K.  Lasted less than 30 minutes in my vendor.  Unless you get lucky, it's probably going to run you a small fortune.
---
I don‚Äôt know much about computers, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an engine issue.
---
The plot would have to save for everyone. So while you're offline it would have to exist without you. The alternative is the current system where buildings phase out of existence when someone logs off
---
Yes and no. The original TSE nerf did not cripple shotguns because they still got a huge damage increase from the explosive effect (not as good as pre-TSE damage but the explosive effect was still very strong)
---
A later patch fixed the explosive damage ‚Äúbug‚Äù which brought the damage way down to where it is now. So it wasn‚Äôt officially a nerf but a bug fix that made shotguns crap.
---
Those Private servers sell themselves after they shut off Survival mode
---
So basically the current system but with less build are restrictions where you can build closer to people?
---
Samesies
---
That's still not a nerf to shotguns. As I already said, they never nerfed shotguns. They nerfed TS and explosive in January and that's it. Shotguns just had the effect stack, which is an issue with the explosive effect, not base shotguns.
---
Unyielding, Easier Sneak, and the Shrouded Armor effect makes it the single best armor for sneaking in the game in terms of benefits. 
---
If you want low weight but some more defense Buttressed Heavy Raider Unyielding Easier Sneak has similar benefits.
---
Not sure I understand your comment. Could you elaborate? From what I understood from the original discussion, OP wants to build more and bigger.
---
Thats just not true. Flat out. Ive been one shotted by people over lvl 300 a lot. Never by a lvl 15. You at 50 have access to better damaged guns than a lvl 15. A lvl 15 will never be able to do the same damage to you that you can do to them. The only cap in place is a maximum damage per shot cap.
---
How did they toke your outfit? Is it made of hemp?
---
No, no, I'm saying exactly that. When I log off it goes with me. Otherwise I could server hop 10 times and block 10 places on random servers. That wouldn't make sense.
---
So yeah I log on and it spawns in my camp into whatever space in is the 10 plots. Not a specific one. Whichever has a space. They are all the same shape, so it doesn't matter which. When I log off it opens that space up for another person to spawn in.
---
Yea the trade one when I'm doing it with a friend I drop bags or the other workaround is to fast travel to an event then run away let the exit countdown timer expire then travel back to person that fixes it. The horde events drop legendary weapons there's a 3 * enemy every time they used to be my favourite but now they don't work ha
---
You need help or your willing to help with me?
---
West Tek and whitesprings
---
Apparently it was duped.
---
Im willing to help with you. Lol. Ive got characters ranged from 150ish to 15. So if people want a similar levelled player to run through with, i can do that too.
---
The Charleston capitol building u go in through the roof go down the stairs and agro the ghouls then alot of them come running up the stairs probably about 30 of them total in that place then I usually just do white spring wes tek and repeat
---
Cool add me on xbox I'm not home right now 
---
Jacob Rules 15
---
I'll add ya back when I get back home then we can start
---
Its the biggest part of my toss up about getting first or not.
---
Thanks for the advice. I already ran the route of ws &gt; west tek &gt; then a few buildings in the ferry. Will have the incorporate this.
---
I want to be a Mr Handy. 
---
Then maybe Rose will talk to me again.
---
Im not at home either. Lol. Im in EST. Ill be home in about 4 hours. Put the kids to bed, take a toke or two and ill be on.
---
Ight that's when I'll prob be back to so I'll save this post and add you when I get home just shoot me a message either on here or on xbox when your back
---
Yeah, ive honestly all but given up on trying to find a better legendary. My TSE handmade works great pve and i dont pvp, so screw it. Lol
---
20 seconds......wow. you're so impressive duped bloody swing speed +1 strength guy.

---
Heard. I screen shotted so i remember the name. Lol.  Damn stoner brain.
---
I just saw this after commenting something similar
---
Even when I was just starting out I never used pipe weapons. It's not difficult to find a 10mm pistol, hunting rifle, double barrel/pump shotgun and their corresponding ammo.
---
Actually it is true - they equalized the damage a few patches back and yes a normal lvl 15 will die to a normal lvl 300 but that wasn't what I said. I said some pvpers run lower levels because there is tiers of damage based off of level and running a lvl 15 bloodied build can actually hit 3-4x as hard against a lvl 300. Now this also factors in a pvp build versus a standard build. There is a ton of factors your not adding in and we actually aren't even talking about the same mechanics or concepts of builds.
---
Same but I'm sure some people would use it take it off my hands
---
Hey! That makes us idea bros!
---
Roflmao ok bro. Don't be so mad. Stop say things you don't know lil boy, it's power attack dmg. It's obvious you need to get laid and that you're very jealous. Here's something for you, if you don't like how fast I do it why don't you go on a private server.....oh you prob can't run a solo silo. Sorry bud life can be hard at times. Oh you can't afford it maybe you should get a job and stop raging in reddit. Or maybe just ask mommy n daddy to get it for you. You have no point and obviously no brain because everything you say to me I can say back to you for the same point. Oh I get it you're a 39year old still living with mommy and frustrated with life that everything doesn't get handed to you and you have to work for it,even in the game.
---
As i tried to tell in my topic... after the withdraws end the addiction is GONE. just like that. no cure, no restard, nothing. just bottle of vadka.
---
You are correct, as the game sits currently it is possible to stay alive for long lengths...which is why I'm suggesting changing some values around to make it not so cake.  'member Doctors Bags in NV and having to limp back to wherever...turning of Fast Travel completely...lowering weapon damage severely and tweaking monster A.I. for instance. 
---
 Im sure the game could be adjusted to make it...NIGHTMARE MODE! (hehe DOOM ref!)
---
Yeah for sure sounds like a solid idea to move dead characters over to adventure if you choose! +1
---
I was actually wandering by a camp the other day and I saw a sloth at someone's base, was about to shoot it since it was showing hostile to me (I've always had pacifist on since day 1, I hate PVP), but I didn't shoot because I noticed it also had the player's icon next to it.  It was fighting something else in their camp but I couldn't see what.  I didn't want to risk "helping" in case my explosive weapon hurt the pet so I just kept on running to my objective.
---
It is VERY possible I saw a sloth and a second later highlighted a turret or something with their icon, but I was 99% sure it was the sloth.  This is all assuming sloths are tamable, I never got into the pet taming part of the game.  
---
Just mentioning this in case what I saw happened to you, only the other player didn't hold their fire after seeing it was owned by someone.  Could be a bug if so.
---
Dang I‚Äôm on xbox
---
It says when you buy it that member benefits will change over time.... it is pretty clearly disclosed.
---
What im saying though is youre capped at damage per bullet. So a lvl 15 cant hit harder than a lvl 300. 
---
In your average pvp match, the advantage always goes to the higher level. Always.
---
Oh and ty I know it's impressive
---
Funny more things still seem to get done faster and better when people work together...
---
Here I am using pistols and semi-auto rifles to conserve ammunition since I never have enough for auto weapons
---
when you build your own houses and such in the creation engine, i think the game still has to read each item individually rather than merging them all, or at least most of them, into one big item the way the devs do for the buildings in the vanilla game, which is probably the engine issue he was referring to. you can raise the build limit in fallout 4 but if you raise it too much and put down too many items your FPS will start tanking.
---
Nuclear Winter is basically aimbots galore; other than that, we're pretty friendly folks on the PC platform.
---
That has a lot of merits actually, no legendaries...hmm, make it more "realistic".  I like it +1!
---
Lmao 1st akready downvoting :D
---
Hey, nice one here for the faction ideas, def need some type of faction struggles...it only makes sense! +1
---
I use my vending machines to supply free ammo for friends and anyone I play with.
---
Rads aren't just a problem in blast zones though.  If I cross a river or encounter a bunch of ghouls, I get eaten up with rads pretty quickly if I'm not wearing power armor.     Just to be clear, I don't use power armor for every character.   But because  I have one  build that is power armor focused and two that are not,   I  can say that PA character has way fewer problems with rads.
---
How do u get that enclave tag next to your name?
---
My turret thought my fence was a threat. It just sat there, taking all the bullets, thinking what it did wrong.
---
in my experience with games like GTA online, the people who love to pvp often don't want to fight *skilled* players, they want to find someone who is a weak target and easy to grief, which is why they run away / go to their facility for the orbital cannon / go in passive mode as soon as they find someone who can actually fight back and beat them.
---
Was expecting a rant.
---
Was hoping for a thoughtful review about why it isnt for you.
---
Got neither.
---
Well played.
---
No vats, cooldown on aid items, nerf tesla aoe by 90%, doing damage breaks stealth boy, seasons. Each season every legendary you have will get wiped from your inventory. Season lasts 30 days. Top 10 gets title in front of their name for next season. Alow clans to be made, enable text chat. When you die you respawn randomly in the world losing   random items not just junk.
---
Yeah, we all just grinded West Tek at level 13
---
I know man it was like my favourite event and hasn't worked for me In months!!
---
Really? I don't understand how I was killed then while in pacifist mode.
---
Dont know what level I was but I had followed the Overseer south until I came to these train tracks going into Big Bend Tunnel and when I came out of the other side, I was clear across the map.  I found this lonely Deathclaw Matriarch with a bug problem and set up camp...havent really left the Bog since.  
---
Turrets are your friend and dont cost bullets...
---
Pacifist mode only stop you from instigating PvP not stoping it completely it'd be the same if one of your friends attacked some body and they retaliated back since your on the same team you become hostile
---
Your prayers should be answered this month ( hopefully ) or sometime after that.

People who use melee in pvp LOOOL why didnt u just drop him take the 50 caps and leave the server, or if someone is hitting u toss a nuka grenade out and vats the grenade quick one pop drop and then disapear like "smoke bomb" and poof ur gone
---
Well after they attacked me I snuck up on them and tried to seek revenge but I was doing no damage. At that point I had changed to pvp mode.  I lit them up with assassin minigun explosive and no damage.

Wtf was going on. I don't really understand pvp which is why I avoid. I know I'm dealing a good bit of damage as I'm a level 200 plus and all unyielding armor blah blah.
---
Shoot I never payed attention till this week
---
Mate I just tried it I fast travelled then boom it disappeared! Opened the pip boy and there it was super mutant horde I didn't have it toggled on! Now it works I'm so happy cheers for the help bro!
---
imagine if there was a way to build up a town with everyone on the server you like everyone has to work to build it up and at some point random raids would happen kinda like in FO4
---
Yeah the assaultrons is what makes it tough solo!
---
Prebuilt houses and buildings we can set up camp at would kill 2 birds with one stone.  Less for the servers to remember and increased budget for people to build defenses and decorate. If the opened up more places on the map or sold buildings in the atom shop we would be set. This would help with player built towns as well.
---
Awesome! By the way what is the name of that outfit?
---
whinge whinge whinge. this sub reddit is full of crybabies
---
Yup, the main thing that hold me that long on ps4
---
People are friendly on every platform :P some don't understand how friendly FO76 community is when the drama queens are ignored.
---
Im the same, I have only done them solo. I did the first one because 2 high level dudes ambushed me and took over the ammo factory from me right after I set it up, so I ran alpha used a ton of ammo and stimpacks and got done in time to nuke the factory while they still occupied it. It was pointless, but felt like a giant victory for me
---
Yeah, that's what I'm saying...
---
They nerfed TS and explosive to deal +25% and +20%, respectively, in January. Then that bug appeared and wasn't fixed until later.
---
That's a nerf to explosive, not shotguns. Then that was a bug fix. Shotguns in general were never altered in any way.
---
I prefer them being separate, it would be far too easy to obtain Purified Water for crafting food items. As it's used for more health Chems, it's not as common to obtain Stimpacks etc. Its balanced if they're two different sources.
---
no that nerf was to 190 iirc.  the 110 nerf was like 3ish months back iirc.
---
Nice job man!!
---
What about 1800 atom workbench to convert ammo, FO1ST exclusive, very cool.
---
Yes ^
---
You never waited for Phingol Autropos in Everquest.
---
a few hours is childs play.
---
My idea would help those players who accidentally set pacifist off, by turning their map pins a different color.  So you'd have vastly less cases of players flagging for pvp because they forgot to change the setting.  
---
I don't understand how this would cause strife, but maybe I'm missing  something.  What exactly would piss people off?  I'm not trying to argue, I just legitimately don't get it and I'm hoping maybe you can explain so I better understand.  
---
In any case it's all academic, it's unlikely to change any time soon and this little reddit thread isn't going to impact the outcome :P
---
That's brilliant cause my issue is I have over 1,000 38 bullets and I don't need them but I really need .45 you see my problem
---
While we are in the topic anyone wanna help a brother out sauce some bullets PSN: Delinquent_3 :)
---
Bless PC.
---
Yep. Been having a higher success rate here too using (E) or Enter vs mouse clicks.
---
Dude me either. Its such a pain in the ass!
---
Block them thru ps4.
---
It‚Äôs been happening ever since they added that stupid ~15 second pop up when an enemy is nearby. Waiting a couple of seconds between keystrokes helps a bit.
---
Will that cover F76 too?
---
If you play S.T.A.L.K.E.R. without always having a Shotgun on you, you're playing it as ultra hardcore
---
Leather armor isnt rubbish. 
---
Some people prefer it for the Energy resist (best in game)
---
Yeah.
---
Should block them for everything
---
Thanks. I hope this doesn't cause any kind of fight.
---
To me that was one of the highlights of ‚Äúclassic‚Äù WoW.  I participated a great deal and had a good time.
---
A donation box at vault 76 with a goal of donating X amount of each material would be a lot of fun.  1 million steel with a 3 million stretch goal?  I bet we‚Äôd do that in a week.  Screws though?  Well we‚Äôd likely just fail that one...
---
Trade things pretty rare for me.
---
Hoard events bug out firbme often 
---
Never dealt with the mic issue.
---
That reminder would work if you showed up as a dot on your own map as well. Its just as easy to do, but theyd have to also change the color of the arrow that marks "you". Thats not a complaint, its more of a "hey, dont forget to do this too if youre gonna do it."
---
What i meant by strife isnt the level of strife i think that youre thinking of. Im talking minor annoyances. Which ive noticed is what people LOVE to bitch about on reddit when it comes to this game. 
---
My strife is hypothetical and future tense. 
---
The majority of my point was that i dont think this change would actually change anything. I think the game would go on as the game is except people would complain about being targeted outside of "pvp" zones. Like workshops or events or hunter/hunted. 
---
I think if you want to do something productive now for the pvp crowd, lower the requirement from 4 players to 2 players in hunter/hunted. Make that a viable option for people again, and its something thats already in the game. That way everything stays the same and some help is still given to pvp players.
---
Got it thanks
---
Sure I can do that. You good to wait till the weekend?
---

Send me a msg.

Jesus Fucking Christ if this whole talk of engine budget issues is false and they‚Äôre gonna sell the supposedly ‚Äúresource intensive‚Äù budget, i‚Äôm never touching this shit again and i‚Äôll dupe the living hell out of everything i possibly can
---
I coded something like this once. Involved a decent amount of recursion to work out the types and to get everything to play nice with our systems, but it wasn't too bad. I didn't mess with conversion rates at all though so good luck with that. We just already had individual stacks of items on vendors people had set up prior.

Block him on PS4 and that'll block him in game. Block him on Twitter too. Just block. Don't engage, don't retaliate and don't read anything. 
---
If it were a bacterial infection, you'd take drugs to get rid of it.
---
Blocking is your antibiotic.
---
If you haven‚Äôt played with random dumbasses, have you even 76ed? Even my normal crew gets a random wild hair for pvp without notice.
---
Well, Bethesda shouldn't have used am engine that barely can run a single player game, for a multiplayer game. You're not wrong, but I don't know if anything can be done about it. Probably just a limitation of the dated engine, it would be more than it can handle.
---
And  now it dosnt find my world
---
They've been lying to us from the start man, I dropped the game a few months ago and spent most of my time on borderlands 3 whenever im not working, I'd probably suggest you do the same, it's only gonna get worse since everything is handled by the suits and all they want is money.
---
are you on xbox? because im on ps4. if on ps4 yea no problem!
---
It feels inhumane but you're probably right. If I try to explain myself he's just going to twist what I say.
---
Honestly it would be nice to bust open one of those old apartment buildings and live in there as a huge community. Actually imagine if this game had a much better Vault Tech Campus with dorm halls. After living in a dorm hall for four years, it would be funny to see Fallout's version. Could also make for an interesting raider concept. Factions that grew out of different dorm halls or frats.
---
We don't need middle aged women stalking the young men of Appalachia
---
ive been there but im wondering if thats everything
---
It happens to the best of us...
---
I did one solo and right before I was about to launch it the server disconnected me
---
Vampires is useless on melee weapons.  You need to have repeated quick hits on the enemy in order to get the Vampires effect.  A large magazine is also essential since you will take a lot of damage reloading constantly.  The .50 cal. with its 250 round magazine is the perfect Vampire weapon.
---
It‚Äôs the Cappy Shirt &amp; Jeans!
---
Is the flute a rare spawn in the Hornwright Estate?
---
Lmao
---
this is the best time to get into fallout 76 cause once that wastlanders update hits its gonna be game changing
---
Sounds like you already know the answer dude lol...
---
Maybe if they give us laser weapon rifle stacks it would be OP?
---
just make a bloody/stealth commando.  They are a dime a dozen and by far the most popular build in the game.
---
That‚Äôs something I would probably pay for lol
---
If you look closely almost all of the weapon Skins are for the least used weapons. Pistols, black powder rifles, combat knives?! It's like instead of buffing the weapons or balancing the game, we'll throw out some weapon skins that look cool. Yes that's great and I appreciate having a fun skin for the Security Baton LOL but I would love to have some Gatling laser love!
---
So it would blueprint your build and save it so that when you log back in it can be put into the closest plot to the center. Ok makes sense
---
But...?
---
I'm level 200+ only done it once and that was basically me just following someone else and trying to stay alive.
---
That's what this post is all about man I don't know why they give us so many forgettable skins
---
Not really. One of the guys we played with swears by a lever-action vats rifle build but, said the damage vs the SBQ is terrible. 
---
I'm in no means an expert on rifles so I have no idea if that's just his issue or if rifles are just not great against the SBQ in general hence the post.
---
yup!
---
i just launched my first nuke too, if you‚Äôre on pc and wanna add me my name is RickSanchez70
---
Ok that actually doesn't seem too bad. No way to abuse it. And it would work within the current no server list setup Bethesda has
---
They said they needed to test increases for server stability. Show me where they said it can never be increased because of server issues.
---
Welcome to Fallout.
---
In the next "update" you'll be limited to half of what you are now.
---
" It just works! "
---
They could do this the same way they did with cleansing of scorched. Give us an objective and if we meet the challenge something gets changed. Could be anything from a building being repaired to discounts at vendors. Easily could be made for factions as well.
---
what is the paper damage?  but yeah that seems a bit out of whack.  
---
Also are you low health running adrenal reaction and nerd rage?
---
Everyone should carry one set of PA.
---
PA chassis can:
---
- be jumped on
---
- block doorways
---
- be placed on top of PA chassis
---
I recommend Excavator to boost ore yields.
---
Or you can only sell 2 ammo for 1 cap
---
Solo nukes are a treat and very satisfying. Congratulations!
---
You really were that upset when scrap boy game out? It takes a little over a week to earn that many atoms just by doing daily and weeklies. I wish it was a quest reward also but the fact it is so easy to obtain really makes it not a big deal IMO... also it doesn‚Äôt exactly provide a gameplay advantage.
---
Gj dude. I've got 2 characters in the low hundreds and I've only launched 5. They're time consuming solo for sure. Hope your server killed the queen and didnt crash haha
---
This is all coming soon! Can't wait!
---
When is it btw?
---
Your armor is fine
---
I would recommend any bloodied handmade. Ffr for the queen if soloing, but if your not a pvp'er then its not mandatory for anything else. A sneaky vats crit orientated build is the way to go. 
---
95% of the time I use a bloodied limb damage less vats handmade &amp; if I solo the queen I use the another same roll handmade primed while she's in the air &amp; a bloodied ffr vats crit fill 15% faster when she's on the ground.
---
I would recommend watching captainoob &amp; angry turtle solo sbq YouTube vids for ideas on your best perk layout &amp; there is an older post if you search for "stealth commando". A really good post on reddit going into armor weapons &amp; perks. If I find it ill edit my response.
---
What's the meta bloody/stealth commando build in terms of gear? Bolstering, Unyielding, something else? And for guns do I want The Fixer, Handmade or also something else?
---
I am working on buying/trading for the gear so before I do that I want to A) make sure its worth it and B) make sure I'm getting the right stuff. 
---
I was so scared that would happen... thats so messed up
---
So your statement is kind of unclear.  When you are killed there's an option to "seek revenge" or to "ignore"  if you ignore you can respawn at the location of your choice.  
---
So if you just respawned as opposed to using the seek revenge option, you are not auto hostile to anyone.  You'd have to re-flag for pvp to engage them.  
---
If you want to pvp my advice is to simply disable pacifist mode.  If you get killed in pvp, choose the "seek revenge" option.  This way the other guy is automatically red and can be freely attacked. m had you done all that you probably would have killed the other guy in your scenario.
---
Seems like an overreaction because you have crappy internet/out of date system.
---
Cool idea....the cats.....and the women
---
Nope full health nothing special just an Instigating Double Barrel with vats and vats for the other two stars but like I said this is without even using vats or even criticals. It says 263 damage in pip boy but on screen numbers are showing like 200-400 damage per pellet when the other one is like 20-40 per pellet.
---
There's also a clean version of the truck on the floor in the toy store area of whitespring. Just noticed it for the first time the other day, and I've been playing since beta. üòñ Other than those, I haven't came across anything else. Don't forget about the bottlecap glasses as well.
---
bunch of sheep in the comments
---
A Mountain Lions roar, while out hunting in the dead of Winter is unforgettable.
---
That actually sounds amazing. Sign me up
---
I heard that‚Äôs how explosive plasma weapons are with a splitter. They‚Äôll do full damage for each separate shot. I‚Äôm guessing the two are somewhat related.
---
I get that the CAMP budget is there to limit the physical size and perhaps even the servers ability to support CAMP's with grandiose-ness. My wish is that just that the neon lights didn't absorb so much budget.
---
maybee try zooming in then hitting it.
---
Get a deathclaw, tough as nails. Had mine for weeks. Still got it.
