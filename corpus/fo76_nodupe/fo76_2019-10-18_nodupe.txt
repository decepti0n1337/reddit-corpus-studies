OMG that would suck, pay for the game 60.00 check, pay for items in atomic shop check, pay for private server check, pay for mods WOW too much. Not sure how GTA does private servers for free and we have to pay for everything.  Hopefully public servers stay free im good with the game play and eventually they will add wastelands.

ATOM Shop is making money.
---

---
Therefore going forward i expect in the future there will be much more of the hated convenience content in the ATOM Shop making money.
---
We can Bitch about it all we [want.It](https://want.It) wont make any difference.Bethesda is tapping in to the lucrative in game cosmetic market that EA and their ilk have been milking millions from for a while now.
---
The money that can be made is mind boggling. Fortnite is making millions a week from these kind of purchases..
---
Gaming is fundamentally changing, catering to a younger generation that love all this stuff.
---
I personally am not seeing why everyone is upset over this. Wouldn't it be best if they didnt put buy to win items in the shop? And isn't that what they're saying they are going to do? I'm just confused. Help please lol
---
Last week I killed two ghouls at fort venture and both had 4 full cores each in them
---
What? Lol... yea... you can utilize the sale. Got a ton of great stuff earlier.
---
Over a 1K scrip and not one fixer...ugh
---
There‚Äôs a container respawn and a overworld respawn based on items not time.  Can‚Äôt figure out how to post a link on the phone to a saved post.
---
Basically you need to loot to get stuff to come back.  Do a run through the asylum with pharma farma on.  Tons of air containers, plenty of junk, straight jackets can go for 50 caps to vendors and you may get lucky on asylum outfits.  
---
If you take that pair of sunglasses from watoga and hang out there in theory it will never reappear.
---
Unless they find a way to make these private servers \*persistant\* there's gonna be a whampocalypse of epic proportions.
---
100% agree. Main menus set the mood of the whole game for me. Why not give us seasonal menu screens?
---
I understand the costs and support required for private servers, and I'm not going to complain too much about it. I say too much because I'm waiting to see the prices. I'm hoping it'd be affordable because it'd be nice to be able to pop on a server with friends and knock out quests and rp a bit together but ultimately, it all comes down to the cost.
---
lmaoo
---
Bruh that quad ffr tesla will get you anything you want on the trade market. Congrats my dude.
---
They didn‚Äôt say anything new lol.
---
The excavator is my teleportation device.
---
When the game first launched you would legit lose your camp. It was unreal
---
Haha I mean I think it should definately be a in-game earnable item, especially considering how they occasionally hard nerf certain weapon types. 
---
But let's be realistic, this is 2019 bethesada  if they do put it in the game there is a 0% chance itll not be a cash shop item.
---
... did you miss the fact I am aware that they have the same stats? Was that not clear?
---
Bethesda greatly accelerated the rate that weapons and armor deteriorated, then sold repair  kits. Bethesda ramped up food spoilage so much they had to eventually back it off a bit but still sold refrigerators. Vast chunks of gameplay involve grinding resources so you can play what's fun, and they sell junk collectors now. So I guess we'll see what they can make appreciably worse, creating a big problem then selling a solution and telling us we asked for it. 
---
Honest guess is, it will involve ammo somehow. Also I wouldn't be surprised for disease and limb damage to get much worse, and they'll want to sell us auto docs.
---
What you don't like it, well now once after every maintenance you will be auto loaded into NW mode when starting game as we can't let Fortnite be alone in the latest treads! (Referencing how Fortnite starts you off in a match at first login but you know if Bethesda did it then we would see it once every week due to a bug)
---
I've spent real money on atoms, but I would never waste my money on the fridge, scrap kits or repair kits. Pretty much the only reason repair kits are useful is because ballistic fiber is a pain to get. I bought the collectron for the cute jokes, but I always have too much junk so for me it is cosmetic. Personally I want to buy new and different cosmetics with my money, not quasi useful items that aren't worth what they cost.
---
Yeah that Quad FFR Tesla is something you might want to put a lock and key on. I've seen it go more than Explosive Gat Plasmas and fixers
---
Lol have fun playing with the same groups of people. Some of us have more than one source of entertainment.
---
Or at least let us mute the music.
---
I got the leather coat last week. I actually like how it looks and don‚Äôt plan on trading it.
---
I'm hoping for another weapon rebalancing. Some weapons certainly need to be tweaked to be good contenders to meta weapons or even need to fixed to be used properly.
---
Then you have to ask why it's a live service.
---
Whats your ER, DR and defensive cards you're running? You should be able to tank quite a few hits for sure with the right combo.
---
I remember, I rebuilt 3 times

You said backpacks are skins because they can be applied to existing backpacks. You are wrong. You need to craft a ‚Äúnuka cola backpack‚Äù or a ‚Äúget out backpack‚Äù etc. 
---
So I asked you... are the backpacks skins in your opinion? The operate exactly like that alien weapon, they need to crafted on their own and cannot he applied as a mod to an existing item.
---
Yeah, they are, but so are combat perks, and sadly some cuts must be made.
---
LOL You fight someone and you don't want them breaking your armor? Respawn. I really don't get the fact you can simply respawn with ignore or respawn with revenge. Either or, but you CAN respawn.
---
Makes me want to throw up just thinking about it
---
Different kinda of games, and different time, things aren't the same as they were decades ago.
---
And yes, I go back decades (PC only, I don't do consoles at all).
---
People can still bitch and moan about how bad 76 is but think about the game today vs a year ago lol it works like a charm now.
---
It‚Äôs just the BiS for fallout. That world record group that killed the queen in 3 seconds - queen killers R us/ HHC - Bloodieds, melee, unyielding sentinel, mutations, stranger in numbers, ate meat and drank Nukashine. There‚Äôs several builds - but none is stronger in PvE. And he asked how to be a destroyer. It‚Äôs cool if it‚Äôs not your preferred build, but it‚Äôs always gonna have the highest damage output. It‚Äôs just how it is.
---
Was... was that not implied? Was I not clear?
---
Remember how mad some people were about the repair kits?? Myself and many others got downvoted into oblivion for bringing the p2w stuff to light. Bethesda ignored all the negative feedback and released them anyway. Then they kept sneaking in little shit bit by bit. Along came the fridge and collector bot.....now this....
---
They said they wouldn‚Äôt put anything other than cosmetics in the shop. Fools that we are, we took them at their word. We shouldn‚Äôt be surprised because they are a business but it doesn‚Äôt feel good
---
ok.
---
Thats amazing
---
They're changing them.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Now you have to think about how many changes so far have been for the better.
---
Seriously the difference is surreal
---
Never used it man! Might be an idea I guess.
---
&gt;  
---
They may have changed it since I stopped but in the beginning the exact scenario I am describing happened.
---
What Bethesda needs to do is drop the non sense and make this a single player game already because they obviously can't make a good buck from this game.
---
How are they skins?.... they cannot be applied to existing backpack. Just like the invader cannot be applied to existing combat knife....
---
Do you not see how you are being inconsistent lol?
---
A nuka cola backpack is still a backpack skin... even though you cannot apply it as a mod.... it operates exactly like a backpack and you craft it the same way you would craft a standard backpack...
---
Same goes for the invader. It operates exactly the same as a combat knife even though you cannot apply it as a mod.... it operates exactly like a combat knife and you craft it the same way you would craft a combat knife....
---
üò∂ Are you a wizard?
---
Yes. Melee damage is directly based on your Strength stat. Adding 15 to that stat by having 5 pieces and being low health makes a HUGE difference in damage output.
---
If you're only pushing 250 with a bloodied you're not running bloodied correctly.  Are you at low health?  You need to be. Add Radicool as well for an extra 5 Strength.
---
like me right now
---
If you are using them they have a use, therefore they are not useless.
---
I‚Äôm born and raised West Virginian and I‚Äôve loved it since the first beta...glitches, server drops and all...I‚Äôve wanted to Fatman my Xbox a few times but it was worth it lol
---
I think your tinfoil hat is a little too tight.
---
they would cost bethesda nothing if they let the people host them.  it's just another way for them to try and squeeze money out of the few players this game has left.
---
private servers would have been the only thing that would got me into this game, but seeing as you have to pay for them, f that.
---
Love this
---
I havent moved from my riverside canning facility
---
and please sell us perk card load-outs for 10$ each
---
That's funny, because the game itself was launched short sighted.
---
It‚Äôs too expensive to move...and I‚Äôm a creature of habit
---
World objects have a **per-character lockout**, based on a history list, instead of time. Each character has a list of 180 most-recently-looted world objects, and a list of 60 most-recently-looted containers. A character must loot enough new things to push old things off their list, before the old things become available again.

I've always changed it out on PC, either with the "bye bye helvetia" mod or one of the others.
---
Honestly... if it wasn't for the insane amount of "take a picture with your camera" challenges, I'd say it should have 100% been an atom shop item instead of the fridge or collection. Because besides being a tool to get atoms, it is entirely cosmetic.
---
What's going on here?
---
Yes yes very much good sir
---
you‚Äôre irrelevant now
---
Nice, I rolled a bunch of armor and guns. All the armor was pretty bad, only got one decent and one good roll myself, Bloodied Hunting Rifle and TSE Faster Reload 50 cal.

---
Here is you incorrectly saying you can apply a nuka cola backpack mod to an existing backpack.
---
And it‚Äôs especially true for Fallout 76.
---
Good modders aren't going to mod if the player has to pay in any way shape or form.
---
People are fearful they will break this promise. It is best they dont put pay to win items in imo. 
---
Lots of people are still hung up on cosmetics only.
---
Atoms are earned by playing the game and all dlc and game modes thus far have been free. If you spent a ridiculous amount of money on a game that doesn't require you to spend money then that's on you, bud
---
Is this unironic?
---
Go ahead and stay with the circlejerk. I'll wait until there's something level 100+ content available
---
&gt; Yeah, we get new players every day.
---
And lose just as many within a week.
---
You are asking for something that costs additional money to operate for free..
---
&gt; selling me literal shit in a bag
---
Are they canvas?
---
Exactly. Ive been preaching this to people and they just say "they'll probably end up fixing it after people complain" but the thing is. This isn't something we want. Everyone's one shotting everything already. And it's not just melee, there's some legacy weapon people who have been just one shotting legendaries! Now, I can see where this COULD lead instead of them not implementing the update. It could lead to them nerfing most builds. Bloodied included. And at that point, il just be mad. Because it seems like there's a few main builds who are powerful. Yes, bloodied is powerful, but you're risking alot. I still die alot more than I would want to, and if they nerfed bloodied I feel like I would literally die constantly
---
Bloodied is good for a Sniper build.
---
The downside with Bloodied is the running with low health to maximize damage out put.I can get my 50 Cal Sniper Rifle to put out 500 + Base,x 2.5 with Covert Operative,and 3 x with Mr Sandman.Throw in Chems/Adrenal reaction etc i can One shot pretty much anything other than major Bosses.
---
Downside is if a Ghoul gets too close to me on the ground and Ghoul slaps me i am dead.
---
So what i do is stay on the Roof Tops One shot like 98% of the Ghouls at Whitesprings. Then change to a DCG fully Stimpack up,jump down and one shot with that instead.
---
SBQ i fully load out all my Strength Perk Cards with  all the Heavy Weapon Perks use an AAE Gatling and Big Guns Bobblehead and Chems,it can put out 180 + Per Bullet.Where as a Minigun for some unknown reason struggles to put out 80 + per Bullet.Wear my Ultracite armour with a Medic Pump and never die.
---
Shotguns are a shockingly bad option now.That was my very first [build.](https://build.Trust)I chose this build just after they made them [useless.It](https://useless.It) was depressing using an explosive Shotgun,virtually point blank at a Mole Miner and having to shoot the f\*\*\*\*ng thing like 3 times with all the Shotgun perks Maxed out.Not got rid of it yet though,i just cant.

Thats a different bug where colliding with a car could kill you ahah, i think that got fixed in fo4.

---
I spent 1000 on my alt on only armor, and literally it was ALL shit. Leather pieces of unyeilding and ap refresh. Yes, it's decent. But it's gonna bring my DR down
---
Agree, im all for making money but they are finding ways to charge for everything. How about a 15.00 credit to those players who bought at the beginning and was witness to the shit show. Eventually players may say thats enough but wont be for a bit im sure now that they have private server they have to pay for so effin crazy
---
&gt; B. If we have to pay for them, force us to make brand new characters and don't allow us to freely transfer them from our private worlds and adventure worlds, essentially a brand new game mode that we get to experience the game all over again. 
---
I also added suggestions if they wish to make us pay for them. :) Please read everything. üëç
---
i imagine the point is it keeps it fresh then when you log in you can take it out and carry it with you for x amount of time..
---
No Harry, just looking at past records :P
---
Let it go dude. The single player ship for 76 sailed a long time ago. It just isn't that kind of game.
---
I agree with option b, but I think paying for your own server is fair
---
I always check out the ding dong who took my spot. One of my characters has an intrepid aye camp that takes advantage of existing structures. Some dude parked up there yesterday with just a wooden box and didn‚Äôt even do anything with the existing structures. Such a shame.
---
it wouldn't if they allowed us to host our own servers. which should've been the case from the beginning.
---
To be honest I would be floored if they did put pay to win items in. Maybe that's just me believing they'll do the right thing, but oh well. I dont think they will. Thanks for replying!
---
&gt;Takes a lifetime to reload
---
Putting it lightly lol first time I got a quad one I had to empty it and check the reload and I was actually laughing at the ridiculousness of the reload. Constantly turning it and slowly putting each bullet in, one at a time...
---
I haven't seen them that high but god rolls and legacy go for about 40-60 bucks. That's from eBay and one of these fallout sites that sells them. I don't think anyone actually buys them. That's outrageous, I luckily got my aae Lazer for 20k caps and a bloodied explosive minigun. Honestly, I didn't even think it was enough, but he had been looking for that for awhile so we both won. I thanked him alot
---
I did. I am saying your A is a silly comment. Also silly to act like Bethesda owes us because we enjoyed playing their game for the past year lol.
---
the problem is not server-sided though. you'll crash just the same.
---
But food doesn‚Äôt spoil when you log out anyway... so it‚Äôs only when you are playing..
---
Did they release statistics or something? Source?
---
EDIT: I misread it. They meant consoles were the other 2/3.
---
Reverse physiology??
---
Because most devs don't, or at least let you do peer to peer or host your own server. Then again Bethesda isn't like most devs.
---
I'd feel it would be fair if we can't transfer our adventure mode characters back and forth. This is really my only problem with them. But if we can I see that becoming a big problem, not only would it be able to cross into that pay to win category but it would also help dupers who figure out a new method every week to easily dupe things and swap them from server to server, essentially ruining the game further.
---
Wtf is ghoul survival mode?
---
I mean yeah they get to run all the world drops but only every 20 hours. Otherwise if what they wanted didn't spawn they'd still have to go server hop. Monthly subscription for private servers are a thing for all games that have them.
---
That‚Äôs the scientific term for the human centipede
---
I feel you and I like your idea on making them create new characters but I doubt they will. A lot of people thought that when survival came out they should force you to make a new character because of the OP builds people already had but they didn‚Äôt.
---
This PR piece by Bethesda is one of the most disingenuous I've seen in a while, second only to Blizzard's recent statement on Hong Kong.
---
They talk about listening to our feedback to provide utility items but absolutely overlooks the fact that they ignored the overwhelming feedback that people really disliked utility items being sold on the Atom Store.
---
I can't decide whether it just reads as Bethesda being very disconnected or patronising. We know when we're being gaslighted.
---
No thanks.
---
That‚Äôs what it autocorrected to since my spelling is on the level of like an 8 year old
---
Poorly. 650 Scrip  and nothing but enough broadsiders to arm a pirate ship
---
I'm not on xbox1 I just wanted to say that your IGN is great.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title.

Personally, I don‚Äôt mind. I ‚Äòwant‚Äô new content between now and then but if this means more meaningful dev time for wastelanders, then I‚Äôm okay,
---
Atom shop stuff bothers me to though yea, I‚Äôd rather paid expansions if money is what they need but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Idk watch his latest vid he plays some sort of Call of Duty zombie thing with ghouls
---
It's silly to want them to not charge us further after spending 60$ on an unfinished game that I've enjoyed and continued to play even though it has it's problems? I mean I guess.
---
I'm real curious what "community feedback" told them people want non-cosmetics in the Atom Store.
---
Exactly.
---
Personally I grew tired of them. I need an energy fence myself. *Science!*
---
Real pay to win items would also make me leave. I wouldn't bitch about it though. Just leave, I've gotten my hourly investment down to literal pennies.
---
Itd be a sad day, but I've more than enough got my investment
---
I understand why Wastelanders is being delayed, but that doesn't change the fact that the title screen is absolutely horrendous. Can you at least change that, it's the absolute worst! We're playing Fallout, not Nuclear Winter, so please Bethesda! Hopefully the DLC delay means it'll be amazing, although I'm disappointed and feel like I've been holding on for nothing, I'm hopeful
---
I might take a break for a little bit and come back later... Maybe, idk
---
I play the game every day... I have over 550 hours in the game and have no idea what you are talking about lol. There are two game modes, adventure and nuclear winter. 
---
Also I don‚Äôt watch youtubers.
---
That‚Äôs what I would do. You just need to take one thing from a container for it to count. My mule was starving and thirsty, so I did a run for food, then it was fun being level 15 for a bit, so I played for a while and looted everything.
---
Man, i'd be all over running a wasteland bait shop, there's one in the game already
---
I've already stopped playing months ago, waiting on Wastelanders to see if I wanted to come back. Now with the delay, it only increases the chances that I'll be done forever.
---
As people have been saying in the sub, they better stick the landing otherwise they're done.
---
Survival is understandable that they didn't make us create new characters, you'd have players who would start from the beginning and have crazy gear while new players would decide to try it and would be completely defenseless against the guys with full ass/sent gear and explosive laser weaponry, but private servers are different which is why I think they would and should force us to make new characters.
---
this
---
I have a mule but never thought about having a character logged in as support. That‚Äôs actually pretty cool. Might need to pickup another Xbox. Have two right now but my GF is on one. We play together.
---
Question, how do you keep your mule logged in? Do you move the controller every once in a while?
---
I need more tires for my trashman build....
---
Any criticism of atom shop stuff gets completely ignored and has since day 1. People got crabby about the p2w aspect of the unstoppable outfits giving in game bonuses. That was the beginning and this is what happened. Many people "called it" way back then.
---
You are asking for a very specific additional service... it should cost money. They keep expanding core game for free. How many hours do you have in? I swear reading this reddit some days makes me feel like such an old man complaining about millennials lol.
---
Just saving it for later use
---
Counterfeit caps have a 45% chance to turn the vendor and all nearby NPCs hostile if used
---
If you have cameleon armor... yes
---
If you haven't played Fallout 76 why are you asking this question? haha
---
Nearly 600 scrip and nearly half of the rolls had the "+30% damage Super Mutant/Robot/Scorched" affix. üò¢
---
I just have 15 strength base (nvm mind modifiers from armor/mutations) and an Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet.  One shots most things and gets 90% of the way on most others except the really big stuff.  Other than that I'm a Commando/Heavy Gunner hybrid.  Focus on Anti-Armor guns preferably with explosive, settle for +50% Limb Damage as helps with headshots and such.  Won't give ranged one shots, but still kills quick enough.
---
I didn't say anything about backpacks there homeslice, but I can field your hard hitting question. It's how sometimes, when you go to your workbenches, you hit modify, and other times you hit craft.
---
Damn. Beautiful.
---
Must be related to Mama Murphy and her drug induced visions
---
several bloodied gamma guns. by several i mean six.
---
Only thing I can make sense of that is that we can't fish because the water is still radiated, but then again we eat mole rats and and mongrels and even super mutants so that's not a valid argument anymore
---
Yeah just take after ESO minus the lockbox shenanigans.  They pump out like 3 DLCs + an expansion every year right now.
---
Private servers will be fine for whales and organised gaming groups. I really don't see it having much traction but we'll see.
---
Sure you got new content. Skins and stuff, it's in the store every week. /s
---
Damn I'd forgotten about that. Aah the bad old days.
---
I have almost 600 hours in it. I don't mind them charging us for the servers that much, my main problem with it is that it could easily be exploited. If it's a reasonable price and we have to make new characters then I'm completely fine with it, I'm just exposing the flaws in it that can potentially become a problem come their release.
---
Tbh I'd buy the cap printer
---
I didn't really expect it anyways since I think ESO was the same, you had to buy it again on Steam. Though, it might be like ESO in the way that you can link Steam and the Bethesda.Net version together so you can have all your stuff from one accessible in the other. That'd be nice.
---
Astral chain has all those bases covered if youre looking for a more traditional experience and you like character action
---
Sheepsquatch Imposter Head, not that it really changes the direction of your tirade.
---
I think that was a mod for Fallout 4.
---
I don't think so. I've been in a server with only 4 people and I could use it all I wanted with no lag.
---
I‚Äôm curious. Also I feel compelled to buy it now that someone else said that does indeed happen.
---
I mean, shit man, I can't show it to you with words lol. 
---
I think it's some sort of quest minigame idk
---
K
---
&gt;Boo fucking hoo.
---
This is a subreddit with feedback that Bethesda pays attention to.
---
If someone doesn't like an aspect of the product they're offering, they might voice their compaint/feedback/etc here.
---
That's how it works
---
Got excited about private worlds until I read u have to pay for them üò≠
---
Log in. Look around the server for signs of life. Compare to earlier in the game's lifecycle. Rinse and repeat.
---
They knew those items would be big sellers because they are only obtainable through the atom shop. All the other cosmetic stuff they sell has variations you can get for free in the game. Bethesda acts so fucking surprised people bought those item........Bethesda and their fucking atom shop bullshit angers me more than anything else. More than delays, bugs, etc. They are so damn dense
---
No problem, I like it too when people who disagree reply to me rather than downvoting me.
---
My fear is mostly that I'm not coming back, even though I want to. This may be just me but between playstation and PC I have a ridiculous amount of games that I promised to revisit but never did. I usually play games until completion and move on, have a hard time getting back into a game I already played. I don't know if it makes any sense but knowing myself I'll be knee deep in cyberpunk or Watch Dogs or something when Wastelanders drops and never get back to 76.
---
You do make a good point, obviously that's just personally how I am, so a lot of players will be returning when new content drops, I really do hope they do a No Man's Sky and fully redeem themselves with amazing content. Would love to see this game prosper.
---
If you scroll through most of today‚Äôs posts, it‚Äôs gonna take a lot more than some weapons buffs to keep their already dwindling fan base.
---
With them pushing back Legendary Players and now this, What really is left to be excited for until Q1 of 2020, Also I hope that you can do a year plan for private worlds and I hope its not too pricey but knowing Bethesda it absolutely its going to be costly, Best case scenario, they let you host your own server that is PtP for free and then dedicated servers are paid for, but they would never allow that. They practically are making you pay to use mods in 76 just in a roundabout way.
---
damn dude you didn't have to do her like that
---
You cannot hit modify on a backpack to apply a skin....that is not possible lol. Have you ever bought a backpack skin?
---
That is my point....
---
You consider a nuka cola backpack a skin.... even though you cannot click modify on a backpack to add the skin...
---
Your entire argument against the invader is that you cannot click modify on a combat knife to add the skin.....
---
I don‚Äôt know why you cannot follow this.
---
Just put something in your stash it happens to me sometimes and when I do that it‚Äôs fine.
---
No. We need aa much p2w as possible. This game cant crash and burn Anytime soon.
---
Rose keeps telling me that she will gut me if I betray her as well it's annoying
---
[deleted]
---
Lol... also a skin
---
[Disconnected from reality]
---
I have bought dozens of things from the atom store and I still have yet to spend a penny past the initial cost of the game.  Atoms are not that hard to obtain just by playing and there hasn't been any item yet I feel gives somebody a competitive advantage over me and the way I play.  
---
Just a bunch of complaining for the sake of complaining.
---
But you control who plays on your private server...
---
Same here
---
Not just the world drops, but every workshop meaning you could farm fusion cores, high demand junk and even ammo all day to your heart's content and bring them all over to adventure mode. There's opportunity to really take advantage of this. I'm speaking from things that I personally would do to give myself an advantage in adventure mode.

Yea its bad.I may be adding a bit of fuel to the fire, but I'm trying to stay positive. I wish they went into more detail about patch 14.
---
Definitely
---
Oh wow
---
I'm sorry who are you?
---
For tbagging lol? You disappear on the map when you are crouched. If you have a chameleon piece of armor your character physically turns invisible.
---
The error is misleading. It should refer you have too many items or too much of one type of item.(technical data and those goverment aid packet holotapes often cause it when the stack is too big)
---
I only get that periodically, and it usually clears off whenever I close whatever trade/inventory window I got it from, and try again.
---
Try dropping off complete stacks of useless stuff if the error doesn't clear by changing a server. But really I've never had it persist for long.
---
Yeah just got the news too, what a bummer
---
And....? What does that have to do with anything I've said lmao.
---
If players have a bad attitude then what good does that do the community? May as well not be playing if you dislike it.
---
In a glider you can easily do over 100 knots. So it would be much faster than running.
---
Now you've done it, now they're gonna "listen to the community" and "give us what we want".
---
I don‚Äôt really understand why people need to reset? Anyway I have zero desire to use private servers so honestly I don‚Äôt really care lol. Sorry have a goodnight.
---
Red Dead Redemption here I come!
---
I feel ya, I'm only about lvl 57, but I bought the game at launch, played to lvl 24, stopped, got back in around spring time with the news of wastelanders. But tbh it's fine, I'm thinking outerworlds will be a great window to do something else while they get their shit together. They know damn well wastelanders is the make or break for this game
---
Level 171, haven‚Äôt collected anything out of the ordinary.
---
Honestly I just want more reasonable prices on cosmetics. Asking for more than a buck or two for fucking flooring and wallpaper and skins and shit is just ridiculous. Apparently I'm in the minority here though, because every other camp I find is full of atom shop decor. It's very disheartening.
---
Good scores! I'll try again tonight with the scrip refresh.
---
yeah, it's kind of weird.  If there are computers that survived the bombs then there should be clocks of all types that did also.
---
Has it been worse lately?
---
stop being a smooth brain and play NW and buy everything in the atomic shop like Todd Howard (the duck) wants
---
I put several hours into Oblivion before I gave it up. There were lots of amazing things about it, but the faces! My god, the faces... I never played Halo, but husband tells me that I should get whatever Halo thing is supposed to come to PC soon. Clearly I'm excited. &lt;/sarcasm&gt;
---
Who's this big boy who can't swim, now? Definitely one of my favourite escape methods!
---
Dude... this is a multiplayer spinoff... if you only want to play by yourself stick to the main series lol
---
And no... many developers charge for private servers as there is an increased cost to them
---
Not wanting pay to win is a bad attitude?  What the fuck?
---
ü§¶ Man, it's like you didn't read anything I've typed. I think people should make new characters and they shouldn't be able to freely transfer them from private worlds to adventure because it can give an obvious advantage and can easily be exploited. But you have a good night also.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me either XD
---
Shit you right it's called Radighoul 
---
  
---
I'm still interested in Fallout 76 anyway
---
They said it was for players who wanted to share the world with others. On minecraft that isn't free either. I'm assuming it will be used for things like dedicated RP servers and such.
---
I agree
---
No they'll just fuck up the meta again
---
Yes happened to me also (recently) had to watch vid to complete
---
u/rbtrizzle
---
Here's my results.
---
Honestly, im hoping that with that concept art someone dug up a few days ago, that those mutations get implemented as well. The super mole rat and super mutant.
---
All he wanted to know is why he disappeared while crouching! üòπ Hahaha im so sorry welcome to our wasteland!
---
They should add code in that changes depending on the season. It's not hard for a multi-million dollar company to do. They just need to decide on the background pics. Throw in a few checks and balances along with some if statement and bam. Auto changing banner to match the season.
---
But with Bethesdas luck they will charge for that simple feature.
---
Correct.  
---
Regarding AA I should add that for extremely high damage amounts, AA is less effective.  So if you are generating 1k+ per shot or similar then it's not as impactful as extreme damage bypasses most dr anyway.  That said most builds leveraging AA are not also extreme damage as that's more the territory of bloodied.
---
That's exactly what's going to happen or worse, Bethesda will forget about the dev room for private servers. But you know damn well people are going to go resource crazy on private servers. Meaning the in game market is going to be very inflated. Making caps that way will be useless.
---
I ain't catching no 3 eyed Springfield fish. No thanks.
---
Shotguns are godly if you like getting close and use the right perks
---
It's not a spin-off though
---
Nothing is really overpowered except for a small handful of legendary effects. You wouldn't have to nerf any base weapons (aside from fixing bugs that let some double-dip on perks).
---
And rather than nerf legendary effects, I'd implement a cap on how much *bonus* damage you can accumulate. Not like the PvP cap where you can't deal more than X damage in a single hit, but I mean like you can't boost your bonus damage from stacking chems, mutations, legendary effects, etc past 200% or something.
---
nopes
---
You can get any junk you want wayyy faster than having all the workshops. Except maybe fusion cores. Plus the amount of time it would take to fast travel to all 21 workshops. Lol it would take all day just to make one round through because of all the loading haha.
---
yeah i thought i was on the verge of getting really lucky but every bloodied was a gamma, mama was just teasing on this day.
---
Yes... it is... this is not fallout 5
---
Oof
---
Fun fact about migration of characters between public and private servers: they don‚Äôt. At least in Rust, DayZ and Ark they don‚Äôt.
---
Okay, the brewing itself is a short quest. Skip ahead to where you said event improvement.. I see it as event deprovement. But other than that yeah we got some decent updates. What is ever upwards you were talking about? Is that encrypt event
---
10mm SMG definitely needs some serious love. The thing has no front sight and for some strange reason Beth gave us a drum mag but not a suppressor. Only thing worse than that is indeed the SA Revolver with its little extra damage, 6x the reload, and no mods.
---
They said they didnt want it to be pay to win. They said that in the article.
---
For sure. I really enjoy this game and I just want to see it get better and better. Private worlds are a step in the right direction but if they release them how I think they will it can also be a few step backwards. Especially seeing how we'll be able to mod them, it's like the creation club all over again.
---
It's a pre-sequel
---
There is a glitch to have 3k+ all resistances and break the damage cap and one shot with any weapon. My group figured it out about a week ago.
---
Better luck tomorrow
---
They're not handing you the server code to a game that they operate online and depend on for their livelihoods.  Aside from the obvious stupidity of that, it would allow people to dig through the server code looking for exploits and errors to take advantage of.
---
I just got offered 60k for it, and while thats an overwhelming amount of money and im gonna have to make a second mule for it, im wondering, is that a solid deal? like it sounds amazing to me, but you guys make it sound extremely valuable and I just dont wanna get undercut
---
That would actually be very cool :D
---
Thanks man
---
Except Beth will delete the online servers if no one plays
---
Plot twist: only spells out his own GT on your camp and leaves.
---
I hope that's the case with 76, wouldn't want something that we've all wanted since release to ruin the economy.
---
Nothing transfers from private servers to public. Toons are different.
---
Hey now, alot of us got the game for $30 dollars. It's been on sale basically since it came out. Other than that, I do agree some. I'm just hoping this game pulls a ESO and turns around in the right direction
---
I can tell if you're on the devs side or not. You are saying to leave then alone but also saying all they care about is money and dont give a damn about anything else which is true.
---
Yeah, up until Beth deletes the servers because the core audience shrunk so low it can't afford to keep it online.
---
Because you'll be able to use Mods on Private Servers eventually, along with potential shortcuts via options that the devs decide to provide the server leader.
---
I'm no fanboy of Juicehead but he doesn't do hate train videos. His videos are one of the most considerate of the circumstances. Praises when things are worth praising, criticising when the situation calls for it.
---
If he's criticising a lot, it's because there is plenty to criticise. 
---
Same to with MrMatty. He would LOVE to wax lyrical over Bethesda and Fallout. However, he's first and foremost not going to lie to you and spin BS just to feel good about the game.
---
I'm glad you're starting to see what some of us have knwon for months - there is VERY little positive to talk about at all about the game.
---
Just to be clear, I don't hate the game for the sake of it. I'd LOVE for this game to be great and worth talking positive about. Bethesda just needs to hold up their end and deliver.
---
I agree, but want to point out that hosting a server on a machine with java is 100% free with proper setup. 
---
I think the difference here is that these arent hosted by yourself. Instead rented from a company.
---
I paid $60 for this game only to be attempted to be nickel and dimed on atoms in the in game store on overpriced cosmetics.  Then after rolling out non-cosmetic only items they release a statement about adding more?  That's not complaining for the sake of complaining.  This is a pay to play game getting free to play more and more by the day.
---
Correct, in-game time similar to the Pip Boy. Probably should have been more clear in my post.
---
And you trust that?
---
I'm pretty convinced that has nothing to do with the server and it's purely random. At the last 25% off sale I cashed in all my scrip (plus the 150 waiting) and got 25 pieces of 3* armor.  Every piece crap except one piece heavy combat chameleon/powered/sneak.
---
Because it's a dedicated server not peer to peer and Bethesda cant just give everyone their own server for free. This is perfectly reasonable.
---
It‚Äôs been a year how long did it take for ESO to pull their heads out of their asses?
---
Can end game players get a bit more too? 
---
Honestly the delay isnt surprising and truthfully a good thing. They need to make sure it runs smooth especially since the instancing technology is supposed to be world wide with it instead of just in the raids which still have a lot of lag on most servers. 
---
I'd like to see more tough "bosses" maybe a fight against a giant robot that has been awaken from the nuclear activity pounding the wasteland. I'd even take a scorchbeast king as cheesy as it may be. I think a boss in each category would be nice and would bring value to those guns and armor less saught after as they would provide buffs to and bonuses against the bosses. Added a few bosses via DLC would be a lot less taxing on the servers and would give the devs an opportunity to iron other things out while providing content for people who are anxiously waiting for the next big DLC. 
---
Ah pipe dreams...
---
Which is another thing I'm worried about, looking at the atomic shop and it's prices.
---
Plus, don‚Äôt those clock use stuff like batteries? (Or highly dangerous fusion core?)
---
Ted: Thanks for nuking the lake, Joe. I really needed a fishing trip to get away from all the scorched killing. 
---
Joe: No problem. But I'll be damned if nothings biting. Figured with all the radiation we'd at least get some glowing crappie. 
---
Ted: Yeah, I know. Pass me a nukashine and another radaway. My pipboy's saying I'm getting pretty irradiated. Damn hazmat's a piece of... 
---
*gets a bite*
---
Ted: I got one! It's a big 'un too! Just a little more!
---
*mirelurk queen erupts from the lake bed*
---
Joe: Ah, shit. Not another one.
---
Ted: Yeah, pass me my mallet.
---
*Joe hands over a fatman*
---
Its pretty bad when you make a game boring to play with then wonder why the community keeps shrinking
---
Alright I'll be responding to each of these sentences in order. It's not really meant for that it's meant for the people on Reddit who complain about getting griefed every 5 seconds. On Minecraft it is completely free, the catch is that you have to host it not their servers, which Bethesda can completely do easily. Not if these are truly private servers, where you need things like a code to enter, otherwise you'd need to seek out these roleplaying servers if you wanted to have any sort of interaction with these communities.
---
Valid point I edited the OP and removed the nerf part. I want to keep it more focused about bringing a larger variety of viable weapons to the game. Your idea of limiting bonus damage is a pretty good one . I'm all for balance man, every give has to have a take.
---
 I've "earned" over 7,000 atoms just playing the game and again haven't spent any nickels or dimes on anything. I've gotten pretty much everything I've wanted from the atom store and still have some banked for future content.
---
So yes, just complaining.
---
Extremely confusing.
---
Can the vault 94 armors ( solar and thorns) roll unyielding as a modifier? I have been unable to get unyielding on either set and don't know anyone that has rolled an unyielding solar or thorn armor.
---
I agree with OP. There's no real justification for this.
---
This has nothing to do with using an exploit.  This is an explanation of the mechanics of the damage cap.
---
Yup! They can roll as any legendary Stat!
---
Honestly I think the rolls you get from the Purveyor depend on when your character joins and then starts choosing armor/weapons on that particular server. If you don't like what you're getting from the first few rolls then try hopping to another server.
---
I've tried dropping the stuff I don't want and then handing my character armor/weapons with the effects I do want from another account, but this made no difference to the results. I still got the usual mixture of hunters, exterminators, mutant slayers trash, with one or two good rolls mixed in with them.
---
It would be way more effort for the devs to code (loot tables) in the way you are suggesting. It would also be more difficult to test as there would be a lot more test cases, as well as potential exploits, to consider. Time is money to Bethesda, so I doubt they would consider doing anything like this.
---
I did an experiment a few weeks ago when I was lucky enough to get some good rolls with 3\* armor (unyielding/sentinel, weightless/weapon weight, assassin/cavalier) on my main character. After I spent all my remaining scrip I joined the same server with another character from a different account. But after spending all the 700 scrip from that other character, I got no good rolls at all, the results were completely different, from the same server.
---
It's perfectly reasonable for them to make unnecessarily paid servers while they could just make it so you would host them yourself, which most people who would use these would want. Honestly I have bad internet so even if I wanted to buy a private server it still wouldn't help due to the fact that they haven't released a way for you to host your own server or even just play privately in general.
---
FO76 is, at the end of the day, a multiplayer game. I understand a lot of Fallout fans didn't want it, but it's here. In FO76, single player is a commodity. You may not like it, but Bethesda won't change that. Besides, extra servers cost extra money, which means some has to pay for it. Bethesda has already provided the game, and I think 60$ is okay, I paid $100 (currency difference) and I've spent more time in game than working to pay it, so it has paid itself off.
---
I understand some people are still not happy with it being a multiplayer, but no one is forcing you to play.
---
I, for one, like FO76 more than 4 purely because I can play with friends and we can go around and help each other, building, trading and exploring, overall enhancing each others experience.
---
I don't like paying extra for a private server, so I'm not getting one myself, but I think that it is more than fair to pay for an extra service.
---
Nope. Not even nylon. Paper.
---
&gt; it would take all day just to make one round through because of all the loading haha. 
---
maybe lol, but it wouldn't be impossible, before the events got ruined I used to teleport to every event I would see just to farm stims and such. I can see people doing this with a good amount of workshop defense events just to farm and collect items. I used to do that when the game was fairly new and people didn't show up just to pvp.
---
I don't know of a game to date that has private servers for free.
---
Side note: if the company does not host the server then you're anywhere from 80- 200$ to rent one privately.
---
Would a private server be a much better way to grind as a solo player?
---
IDK I've def logged in to a huge stack of spoiled meat
---
You're better off keeping it as a trade item, whatever you want that gun can probably get you it. You're new so don't let others take advantage of that!
---
Please never fix the most end game armor we have. Dont fix stranger heart armor!
---
Is that a bad thing though? Changing things up keep things fresh. Everyone and their mother running a bloodied stealth build with a handmade is going to get old...
---
Yes, so you expect them to continue this trend instead of learning and making improvements on their methods instead? There is a difference between expecting failure and wanting them to fail
---
if people have such a problem with this stuff, why not organize a protest? You know like what people did back in the old days?
---
Source? Maybe you didn't actually read it, or can't figure out that:
---
PC: Could host private servers on their machine. Some of them 
---
Xbox: Nope.
---
PS4: Nope
---
So you see.... There's 3 platforms. On one of them, some of the players could run private servers......
---
1 out of 3. Or if you learned fractions.... 1/3
---
My source? Basic fucking grade school math.
---
now all they have to do is charge us for perk card loadouts and we'll all be happy :))
---
the purveyor is a she?
---
Booo
---
Are you looking for the wetsuit plans or the shielded mod?
---
The tl;dr is pretty much that they're not getting enough people buying Atoms through cosmetics only, probably because most of the cosmetics are bland and/or stick out like sore thumbs in the game world.  That and they've been probably trudging along with low player numbers in general.  
---
So now the idea is to increase the amount of convenience items to compel folks to buy more atoms from what's already a smaller playerbase.  
---
Can't say I'm surprised to see this coming, because this is pretty much what regularly happens to any game that dabbles in microtransactions and claims to be 'cosmsetic only'.  The moment they get a taste of that "well it's not technically P2W" money is the moment they'll start putting most quality of life/convenience items behind cash shop points.  
---
At this point it might just be better to have paid DLC/expansions and offer atom shop item bundles on a regular basis.  If the game feels like you're purposely being hindered until you pay up for cash shop items that's even worse for most folks.  Especially when there's already a pay wall to get into the game initially.
---
Shielded mod
---
TS fat man counts as 2 different sources for damage. Can get 220 out of one. I use it a lot mostly for the luls in survival.
---
Not 100% if fireproof and dense comes before or after the 220 but most players would be a sneeze away from knocked if they were still up.
---
The Nuclear Winter title screen stresses me out
---
Yes and yes.
---
I dumped a ton of my Scrip into three-star melee, too, and didn't get Limb Damage at that rate.
---
Wait until Wastelanders + modded private servers probably.  Would be even better if they could release it with Steam workshop integration.
---
Lucky hole mine as previously stated but I'm mostly melee if I need lead I hit the monorail and I've not noticed a reduction
---
It seems I have simply misread your statement. You could have clarified this without all the needless vitriol.
---
Now your just being petty. 
---
When I say useless I mean, there's not a need to buy them. They don't solve a problem that isn't easily solvable in game, or there are other options that are just as/if not more effective. 
---
The collectron is useless. It's rate of return is laughable. Hence why most people buy it to have a robot with a bad sense of humour around.
---
When I imagined private servers I was hoping for something completely off of Bethesda's servers that players would have the freedom of messing with themselves - that said, I'm sure just giving the player base access to server options would mean revealing the spaghetti code and resulting in some form of a DDoS attack
---
Most truely dont understand that server hosting costs money. I have more than gotten my enjoyment out of my investment. 
---
Comparing it to movie theatres, that would probably be 12 hours of non interactive screen time. Ive gotten 60-70 times that amount on 1 character, and its interactive.
---
I think this generally stems from people not having a full understanding of the time and effort to even make a sub par online game. (Not that I would claim this is one)
---
It wouldn't hurt the game to go f2p with limits like wow has (f2p to level 20) or even if they just allowed the NW side to be free the would being more people in, many of which would still but skins
---
I wish we had the option to turn the music down
---
Cause they are a bunch of entitled babies. That don't seem to realize that video games haven't changed in price in the past 3 decades. Also most video games with private servers charge for them.
---
Folks were saying this game was already dead at launch.
---
Where's the video? Post that shit. üëç
---
Game sharing is in no way comparable as far as scale, popularity and length of existence.
---
I don't game share, I play very few games, but I play them almost exclusively.
---
not really so much as just you
---
Mhm. That‚Äôs just amazing tho.
---
You can get used enterprise grade rack mountable virtualization servers for dirt cheap. On an r710 poweredge Im running multiple minecraft servers, an ark, 7dtd, windward, BF:Vietnam, and terraria servers all at once and barely using any system resources.
---
Even with the paid servers they still don't fix my small problem of crappy internet, since they can't just make a singleplayer mode. I understand that a singleplayer mode might increase duping and such, since it's not as easy to report, but I can't help but think that they're making servers that should be free and should be hosted by the player (not the company) so that the only real benefit is having a server where you can close yourself off from the community basically making the entire point of the game lost.
---
Minecraft has a client for java that is pretty usable. This may have been phased out with realm additions. But it used to be a thing poeple could do. It was somewhat difficult if you didnt have a website port for it though, as it wouldve been a raw ip input.
---
U dont speak for everyone in the fallout 76 community. There are alot of players besides me who buy there utility items.
---
Didn't try the Fat Man, or any explosive heavy really, as their use in PvP is uncommon in my experience. 
---
The damage numbers displayed (and the cap) are based on actual damage dealt after resistances and effects.  If it were before then no one would ever be able to do any significant damage as the 110 would be mostly mitigated by decent armor.
---
I mean they'll make nocturnal the new meta and only nocturnal explosive the dragons will be the build. It's happened a few times, come on just be grateful that you have the option between bloodied, junkies and anti-armor handmades
---
I wish I could give you more than one upvote.
---
I feel you, Even worse is every good piece of armor I got was on the toon that's missing the Fixer/Bear Arm/Sheepsquatch plan. 
---
I'm just mad I didn't get 1 Fixer in 2k scrip lol
---
I'm not saying a traditional glider. I'm talking about the ones that look like they're made from sticks and leaves. They could stuff it in as a scout quest really easily.
---
Hopefully they‚Äôll do something for the nuking anniversary on the 23rd
---
Other than the 60$ you paid for the game, why should it be free? Not being condescending, or at least not trying to, just trying to think why it should be free. As for internet, Australia as it pretty bad, depending on where you are, but its still playable.
---
I dont want them.. and I dont buy them..
---
that said.. he dont speak for me either...
---
Dayz has a download that you yourself can run on your own tower. Problem is that get pretty buggy (even more so then normal) when few people join. You really need decitated server to handle this kind of load.
---
And then you get the fun of mod abuse and begging for donations. I get someone has to pay but getting spamed every 90 seconds to a paypal website is not fun.
---
You're not wrong, but Minecraft would run on a potato, so it's not really the same thing, right?
---
Because server hosting costs money and they're already shelling out enough for regular servers.  You want a private server? You pay for it.  Every game with a private server option is the same.
---
How was it not vague? Almost every person and their mother still had no idea what the game was like after e3, the presentation itself was very much misleading as well.
---
I thought it was just me.
---
Wooooo! Congrats Chickady! Love your content!
---
Actually being serious that's a bad idea, you think that it requires 0 effort to get, but even with it being duped it's incredibly hard to get. Each piece needs to be collected and crafted all at the same time with max intelligence along with the fact that it takes literal months to make a set of it, much less a second to test duping with.
---
[removed]
---
I know of 1 that does free private servers. Ark survival Evolved.
---
Don't run any of them lol..gunslinger my friend. Instigating is my pal right now. Idk if you've ever playes Diablo 3. I played for a bit and one thing I loved was how different builds were top dogs each season. It made you try new things and experience the game in different ways. Not saying this game needs seasons. But a change up occasion can be refreshing.
---
Lol ok. It‚Äôs a spinoff outside of the main series. The other games are single player, enclosed story line, this is different.
---
I think so many of you people being overly defensive of Bethesda do not understand how online games work.
---
Let me make it simple.
---
No People= No game
---
This isn't an offline game, if Bethesda chooses to abandon it because player counts get low and profit margins aren't acceptable, then they loose money by running servers. The game gets shut down.
---
The player count is already dropping rapidly. I imagine we'll see even more now. If they make changes (down-grades) to daily weekly challenges then I know I'll completely stopped playing also. It's a dangerous path for this game.
---
Crazy - made a post about exactly this that the additions of the past few items to the shop was a slippery slope and it'll lead to more P2W or P2Convenience creep and got flamed super hard about it.
---
Awww how cute!
---
I have shielded mod for brotherhood underarmour &amp; enclave underarmour but not marine wetsuit.
---
Overwatch, Minecraft and a few others I can't name at this time all do it for free.
---
I cashed in 12 tonight and every single one was trash.  0-12 are you kidding me?
---
If the passive mode is set on in their settings then no one should be getting griefed. I've heard of a few exceptions with certain mutations, but those who have complained on reddit were told the issue. If I remember correctly it was something that made the character shoot back automatically? Either way, I think it's pretty straightforward...turn on passive if you dont want pvp. Otherwise, switch servers. I've never had a problem while making sure I do those things.
---
While other fallouts have been singleplayer, fallout 76 is not. It's an mmo and has always been advertised as such. I, at first, was worried about it not being singleplayer, but after playing it, was not an issue at all. I'm not sure what everyone who is (still) upset about this was thinking when they bought it, but that's just the way it is. It's an MMO.
---
So does that mean perk loadouts and legendary players are coming this year? Because they already said they pushed those to next year but it makes it sound like its coming this year now?
---
And I‚Äôve not played for 3 days and still had the 10 raw wolf meats from the last time I did leader of the pack still in my inventory lol
---
It's strange, man. I'm playing a game with a sub right now but I will refuse to spend money on microtransactions like the atom shop ($14 for a single skin? that's a whole month of a subscription!) I really like knowing that I, through some amount of effort, have access to everything in the game. Nothing is behind a pay wall, there is nothing I can see that I will have to spend more money to get.
---
That said, 76 would need waaaay more content to justify a monthly sub.
---
That doesn't justify paying $10 for 1100 atoms and 700 atoms for a virtual fridge.  That fridge costs $6.36 by that logic.  That doesn't matter if you get atoms in game.  Bethesda is still charging money for atoms even if they're giving them free in game and that's what they cost you.  Paying for the fridge costs $6.36.  Either grind for it in game or pay that much for it.
---
 l cashed in for 9 and got trash as well. At least I have a lot of scrip for the days coming up
---
Ya I figured most people have a couple points into fire proof. Anyways it's a damn beast and the blast radius is huge.
---
I was surprised more people weren't running it. So much fun. Spendy on screws tho. 5 nukes for 8 screws plus other stuff. But i did indeed wreck in survival. Even had more then one person come ask what i was doing to hit them so hard lol. On the card it's way lower damage then junkies or bloodied but the fact that it's 2 projectiles and each is way way above the 110 made it my fave.
---
Im a whale who pays them $200,00 per month for utility items.
---
But it doesn‚Äôt 
---
You honestly need like 50 chances to get a few good rolls.  10?  20?  You are fucked
---
The best is this past week leading up to the event they completely nerfed Whitesprings drops.  I‚Äôm so sick of this bullshit.
---
I agree. As it is though I certainly wouldn‚Äôt buy atoms for a game in a state like this.
---
Oh wow that would be a kick in the pants if u had to start from scratch on a private server, here pay for the server oh yeah by the way u hae to start a new character..that sucks
---
No. I'm talking about an actual exploit, regardless of what you are referring to.
---
"Don't you people have credit cards?" - Bethesda probably.
---
&gt;Private servers are dedicated servers, and they cost money on Bethesda's part. Battlefield does exactly the same.
---
OK, you already done screwed up here.  Private servers can - and are in other games - hosted on whatever hardware you want to host them on.  
---
Bethesda doesn't have to host them.
---
Waaaaaaay back in the olden days, we used to get a client-server package as part of the online component.  Then you could rent server space FROM ANYONE if you wanted persistent servers.  
---
And if you had the hardware you could run your own persistent P2P server.  In fact, you could run non-persistent servers from your own desktop if you chose - the world would just end when you shut down for the night.
---
So yes - Bethesda is perfectly right to charge for the server access they're renting out.  And its good of them to offer this service.  Sort of.  I mean, they're not a server company and given how FUCKING POORLY THE LAST TIME THEY JUMPED INTO SOMETHING THAT WASN'T PART OF THEIR CORE COMPETENCY (ie, when they made FO76 - which, let's not forget, they kept excusing as 'something new for us') turned out, I'm . . . just not all that confident that they can run a server hosting side-business.
---
But no - Bethesda should not be locking this down to only their company.  There are other server companies out there, there is nothing blocking P2P either, except Bethesda trying to gouge.
---
Lol I get what you are saying now. So if you are teabagging somebody it basically will look like a blinking dot on the map. So everyone will know what you‚Äôre doing lmao
---
Dont trade I own a few items like this they are virtually priceless you can get a full set of armor ect things people will never take Caps for. Better off building a chr around it. The cap/5.56 market is as stable as yuan.
---
Yep
---
Edit: imagine you and a bunch of your buddies are traveling across the wasteland and constantly teabagging as you move.
---
Honestly, between year 1 and year 2 were the most changes to gameplay and how things worked. And it's booming now like.. 3 years later. The only thing im really worried about is that next year is when the new consoles are going to release. Around a year and 3 ish months. And with the PS5 coming out to not be fully backwards compatible, I have a feeling they are going to drop this. Now, on the other hand, this also leaves a TON of content to be dropped between Jan-march 2020, as long as none of it gets delayed again
---
Minecraft servers are Realms, and they're not free.
---
I'm a new player so more time for me to complete quests before the whole world gets changed I guess
---
Im cool with that decision.
---
&gt;Also, some people think that everyone  has to pay to play on a private server, but that is not the case. The  only person who pays for the service is the host, not the guests. This  is how it works with other games.
---
I'm almost entirely certain that Bethesda is going to charge a monthly fee for access to private servers at all so that players have to convince their friends to also subscribe to play with them on private servers, which is free marketing for them. This is the new slimy mentality the AAA gaming industry thinks with.
---
Mods are coming later so that after this is established as the norm for Fallout 76's private servers, peer-to-peer won't be available and mods will be akin to console mods for other Bethesda games with nothing like script extenders being possible due to having to go through a Bethesda server.
---
Lose all hope you have for Bethesda as a company if Pacifism Mode is removed from Adventure after paid private servers become available.
---
Bruh, don‚Äôt hate the whales. Hate the ocean....or something.
---
If you "host it yourself" that's a peer to peer connection. As in all other games that connect you to friends peer to peer it would be limited and you would only able to move up to render distance from the host so it would be pointless.
---
As others have said this ain't fallout 5. Bethesda made fallout 76 to be like zinamax with ESO.
---
I got my second copy last night and between being at work I havent gotten to really utilize it yet.
---
Since we have two tvs in our living room I'll probably just have the second controller near by to occasionally move. I believe the game logs you out after 30 mins of inactivity? I need to look into that.
---
I would be so happy with a Halloween title screen
---
I just want to play in general, I was having PC issues for a couple months. I just got everything sorted and am thrilled to hop back in this weekend. It‚Äôs been a while so I need to catch up on updates
---
Thanks! I haven‚Äôt worn any clothes or armor since starting and I just hit level 100! Well to be fair I started using power armor in high radiation areas around level 80 because it got REALLY old to grind all the rad x and rad away to survive radiation. DT wise I‚Äôm good.
---
Come out swinging?  What you work for Bugthesda? 
---
This game sucks right now.  They fucked up and removed survival and the only joy in my gameplay is mixing it up with others.  Had a good battle tonight with a 275 guy (what up) but otherwise it‚Äôs the same boring shit and other players get butthurt if you try to stir it up with them.  Props to you duckies and bunnies crowd.  Build more stupid camps and downvote PvP.  I will never buy another Bugthesda product ever.
---
But I did mean the OP more towards the weapons themselves rather than legendary effects. For example right now the handmade trump's the  combat rifle in every field hence everyone wants a handmade and a combats rifle is much less valuable. Maybe give the combat rifle some love and give people a reason to choose (or a reason not to )over the handmade. Maybe it does less damage but give it a faster fire rate than the handmade and cheaper vats cost or something.
---
Yeah, I think they didn't have any intention of releasing this when they did but decided to do so because they had a push back the actual good stuff
---
1. It's not duped
---
2. I know it requires a lot to get.
---
3. I actually want it fixed
---
True
---
Kudos to whoever wrote it though, it takes skill to spin things as hard as this was spun.
---
I mean, I know you know, but thats how this works. People have the option of not having these things, or paying the Atoms/cost, and then then company has carte blanche to proclaim "See how popular these items were and how willing people were to pay for them! They clearly want us to charge them for more items we could very easily have made a free reward at the end of a free questline! More incoming!" despite there being no other way of getting them. To this day I haven't bought either the fridge or the bot, despite wanting them, because screw these practices, but I understand why someone would.
---
It's what many people have been warning against and been getting crapped on as being haters, and of course the poor folks who bought these items are going to be surprised, because there was no malice in their purchases. They just thought Bethesda (perhaps naively) was better than that. But no cooperation is. Because you aren't dealing with Todd or Pete on a personal or even professional level. It's all Zenimax marketing. This is how the slippery slope works, and we've had verbal confirmation of it with this update. I hope a lot of people who insulted the more cynical poster, who paid the same entry fee they did, are examining themselves and their views more closely with this.
---
For 1500 atoms
---
- and as much as this is a joke, it's also literally what they did a Christmas. That good ol Christmas spirit.
---
Fine, they can just grab some of those creation club guys
---
It‚Äôs still complete bullshit 
---
I mean, it‚Äôs one thing to get trash but damn
---
I don't see how that will break the game. Similar things were said about Survival before it launched, and I didn't see any impact on Adventure mode from it personally.
---
To add to the mystery, I just now got myself a the Sturdy Raider Chest plan from The Messenger in the Mire. Picked up the quest immediately north of Gnarled Shallows and ended it at Southampton Estate.
---
Talon is not useful if you use your axe :/ you'd prefer twisted muscle. I may be incorrect but unarmed profit from both twisted and talons.
---
Yes the delay is a good thing if thats what it takes to get it right especially when the wastelanders update could mean a second chance for the game, and based on the current schedule the delay isnt 6+ months its at minimum 3-5 months, also i dont know why everyone expects the private servers to be free thats just not how it works, (if you want your own offline/privately hosted session thats another matter) but they cant just give entire servers to anyone for free for thier own private use based on other games that offer similar services (Ark, Conan exiles, ect) and the price range based on that will probably range anywhere from a just few dollars and up typically depending on the number of players you want to allow, lastly and this is just a personal opinion, as much as people understandably disagree with the atomic shop utility items (i dont really care for them myself either) i dont think its fair to call them "pay to win" as they dont really offer any advantage over anyone else competitively, if you ask me theyre more "pay to convenience" then anything, i do think items like the fridge and scrap bot should have been added into the game for everyone rather than being in the shop but i dont think its a big deal.
---
There arent many mods for it. 14 according to my weapons bench. 
---
That sounds like a pretty slick rifle. With the 110 damage cap you probably won't even need to utilize the junkies prefix on it to be effective in PvP.
---
Hey guys! perkcard loadouts for the low price of 1000 atoms each! Can't wait. Smh...
---
Well i found my god server!üòÇüòÇ Bloodied Faster Fire rate Fixer üôåüèΩüôåüèΩüôåüèΩ
---
Nope. I did it solo last week. As soon as i got to the lvl 80 scorch beast i waited for it to fly. Witch after it did i grabbed all from tagerdys body. Then it landed then i wacked it around like a red headed step child with my 3* super sledge till it died.
---
ESO just does a lot of good compared to its bad, the nonstop events always have cool stuff to earn and do.
---
I‚Äôll toss something else you wanker
---
Or does it work at all? The world may never know
---
Many more losses
---
You must enjoy wasting money then.
---
Are you referring to the Stragler PA acid damage?
---
Is this only on PC?
---
Im sure just like in other fallout games as soon as u use mods u lose the ability to gain trophies etc..who knows what else they will limit considering i could go to a private server build my character using cheats to a lvl800 come back to public servers and wreck everything in my path. I feel like they wouldnt allow that considering what they did with other fallout tiltles when it comes to mods. Who knows but we will find out soon
---
Oh, I didn't know you could apply it to a legendary assaltron head. I guess I was wrong in this instance. My apologies.
---
Its a good thought im sure ur right.
---
Did your laser rifle cause either of your clients to freeze? I've been using one lately and it is freezing me and everybody around me if I shoot at something relatively close.
---
I'm not going to price everything out first of all there is not a stable currency or a way to hold all that currency. Caps max out per chr to fast 5.56 is crazy unstable it could fall out in 1 patch. 
---
Your best option is paying someone for an hour or 2 to mule that stuff and be very picky about who.
---
Fuck all of this 
---
Bugthesda can eat a bag of dicks
---
If it's in the creation club then thats what consoles will get. Not sure why everyone thinks that suddenly xbox and PS have rescinded thier tos. That tos includes tampering with files (modding or hacking).
---
The spread is still bad enough.
---
I accidentally bought the plan the other day without realizing the cost. I bankrupted myself with 1 purchase
---
Private server ? Seems like people who want this want to play alone aka single player. I don‚Äôt see why investing time or money into private servers is even being considered / seems like better things we could be doing
---
Ark allows you to make servers for you and your buddies to screw around on.
---
I'm excited about the possible RP servers that will inevitably pop up. I miss RPing with like-minded players!
---
They aren‚Äôt better but I can‚Äôt say it‚Äôs people being naive
---
Bugthesda just sold everyone a literal bill of goods.
---
Its my money to use as i wish so i spend it on 76 and ESO to further bethesda and zinamax witch also helps in paying for future content. So i see it as money well spent.  And have fun down voteing. Im use to it.
---
Classy.
---
Best of luck finding a cheap copy on PC! For us console players we can actually buy a copy for $10 from Redbox machines.
---
Adding to that, if CAMPS didn't disappear when you left the game. Since it's generally going to be the same group of people playing on a private server, it won't be as much a problem.
---
You realize you get free repair kits in game, right? I got 3 last night, two from SBQ and one more from Encryptid. About 15 minutes apart too. I have over 2 dozen on me now, never bought a single one.
---
Its not private servers, you either rent them or use your own machine to host one. There is no way the game publisher gives you a free server for you to have and do what you want with it.
---
That's an awesome idea a whole server roleplaying would be amazing. :3
---
Better inventory. Perk manager. Can change up some of the god ray / blinding light when exiting buildings.
---
I know someone on PC who has the same issue.  I'm on PS4 and haven't had it, but using VATS on a grenade with one is almost a sure-fire way to cause a crash for me.
---
You see that's anecdotal evidence at best..... Which is not sufficient to "prove" your claim. Especially when talking about numbers...... It can be helpful or useful.... But even the anecdotal evidence of this entire sub wouldn't be sufficient.
---
You see I, on the other hand am always on populated servers. So who's anecdotal evidence do we put faith in? I base mine months fact that I use others vending camps to fast travel (which seems to be cheaper than normal fast travel (more anecdotal evidence)
---
But maybe I'm on PS4 and you're on Xbox......
---
But maybe I'm playing at peak time and you're not .....
---
But maybe 68 other things....
---
That's why anecdotal evidence does not equal proof.
---
Yes but even as a comparitive. I have quite a few f76 players on my friends list from trading, a couple months back I used to see like 20-30 people on in the night, now it's like around 4-5. And I imagine it will drop more with the most recent news of delays, and IF they make changes to the daily/weekly challenge system.
---
So same old same old?
---
Yeah I edited the post to reflect I play on PC
---
Except the map doesn‚Äôt move in real time like GTAO. 
---
You won‚Äôt see the player‚Äôs icon blink on and off while starring at the map.
---
I just want to talk about not having enough resources allotted to an allegedly great DLC.  Sure the Atom shop bangs away with new content every week, but new DLC.....promised, delayed and lather rinse repeat.
---
Everyone's fine with paying for private servers until they charge us 30$. Just wait until next week and watch how this blows up in their face. üòÇ Everyone who's fine with them won't have the same energy then.
---
Yeah same, alt had nothing good drop.
---
Ya pretty much. Top 3 on nexus plus what ever little things you like.
---
That's literally game breaking, but wouldn't get the godlike resistances he's describing using whatever cheat he claims to have.
---
Sadly Im on PS4.
---
I know certain things are dynamic in rea
---
Time though like events starting.
---
They're gonna have to nerf stimpack drop rates and get rid of the perk that removes radiation during the day, then. I have to sell the stuff off because I always have way too much and I'm a facetanking melee player who pounds stims in hard fights. I don't need healing items or food unless you're gonna nerf them into scarcity, just give me the damn 10 Atoms for spending an hour finding 5 ants.
---
So have they finally come out and said "hey we aren't going to ban you for this stuff"?  It was a really grey are when I stopped playing.
---
Overseers box at the first encampment.   Grafton is out of the way for newbies.
---
It just cripples enemies faster
---
Yeah creation club is kinda a bad Idea for FO76 considering the atom shop and we all now how broken some of those creations were but who knows for private use maybe
---
Exactly. How anyone ever got mad at the fridge is beyond me. It's worse than the backpack mod and the 2nd and 3rd levels of the perk. Plus, you have to leave your food at Camp, and you can only put 15 things in there. You can carry thousands on you at any given time and they will still last 40% longer than the 15 in the fridge.
---
Thats actually a good idea.
---
Have u played Ark Evolved. Im thinking not. Well i have and they not only gave private servers for free but gave players Consle commands.
---
Well before launch it was clearly spelled out as an always on service multiplayer Fallout game......
---
No
---
NV was a spin off too. Just happend to be better then the games Bethesda makes üòÇ
---
It's a shame it is a fine pvp weapon but not too useful when I crash myself with it.
---
Thanks for the info. I thought the cap was only for survival, not adventure.
---
But does that completely disregard them trying to charge you money for them?  No it doesn't.  And however many you have is irrelevant because not every playstyle follows the same balancing around repairing weapons.  Some shit lasts forever and other weapons not so much.
---
"Claims to have". Calm down dude.
---
They have a separate team working on the Atom Shop. Besides, the Atom Shop primarily just needs artists and some light coding, Wastelanders needs far more in terms of coding and art, plus quest designers/writers, level designers, and QA.
---
Said noone ever, dead money is the most hated dlc across the New vegas community
---
Than*
---
If you manually shoot at an enemy limb outside of VATS with a +50 limb damage weapon you will cripple the limb faster.
---
That‚Äôs true. Also the horde boss icon will move in real time. But player markers don‚Äôt do this. You have to click out and back in to see player movement
---
I'm guessing it is the same exploit that a certain group of people regularly use in PvP and to take the SBQ down before she makes it off the ground out of the fissure.
---
There is no point in wagging fingers, but anyone who pointed exactly this sort of move out as being possible or even likely has been getting rated down into the double digits or insulted for months, to the point many of these people long ago stopped posting. So rather than assume the people who were behind that malicious I choose to believe they simpy hoped for better. Maybe I'm the naive one, but I would prefer that to be the case, than that they are just so blindly dedicated to a company that's only goal is to make money that they would earnestly and loyally believe in said company's impossible (because a business is by definition profit oriented with no moral stance to speak of) goodness than listen to a word from their fellows mouth. That's dystopian cyberpunk style brainwashing right there and I don't like to consider it might have long taken root.
---
I don't want them breaking my armor post mortem, that's clearly not an intended feature. Again yes you can respawn but you shouldn't have to.
---
It's not a choice. Its consoles have thier own rules for games that are made for them.
---
ESO has mods. Its a list of pre approved kimda stuff and mostly QOL. No changes can be made to core game play. This will be the same.
---
Oh absolutely. Was just pointing out that there are a very select few that kinda can.
---
I played Wolfenstein Enemy Territory &amp; Quake when there was no subscription for anything and I am done with this scam of a game. I expect their next 2 \~ 5 games to be in the same vein.
---
I'll believe it when I see proof.  
---
Of course, if you are actually using it, you'll eventually catch a ban for it.
---
So did I until we lost survival. Learned it exists in adventure too.
---
Went through my 1000 with a mix of armor, melee, and ranged. All was junk. Multiple wood armors and ones with lower stats than my non legendary armor. One rifle have 10% damage bonus if mutated and when aiming. All will be resold tomorrow but there is only 120 a day you can get back. I'm not surprised at all.
---
Oh ok. Do u have plans for enclave armor
---
How are you getting griefed every 5 seconds? Lol
---
I genuinely think they are making these "chumps" up.  No one is beating down the doors for Repair Kits.  The Refrigerator seems relatively rare too - I seldom come across a CAMP with one.
---
In the most cynical light, they are interpreting the Collectron and the free Scrap/Repair Kits from the Atom bundles as "user demand" for such things.
---
But with hosting servers come more issues as you are requiered to own 2 consoles or 2 computors to be able to play on that server. 1 would host it then the other would be used for playing.
---
I know the pain.  Sometimes in the heat of a fight I'll forget to switch weapons and use it to hit my grenade.  BOOM!  Instant blue screen.
---
Yep, we sure were talking about backpacks initially and this isn't you changing the subject just slightly enough for you to have a leg to stand on, but I'll play along. Yes, backpacks, that you learn how to make multiple versions of in game, are different than weapons. You win. You can learn to make 4 different kinds in game. There are as follows, small, this is the newest one, and not great, tadpole, which I'm not a big fan of. Possum, which is much the same as tadpole. And standard, that is my personal preference. These also, are not skins, but actually different backpacks.
---
I understand the point you want to be correct all to well, but you are sadly mistaken on the point you want to make. I have weapon skins in this game. I have a sledgehammer that looks like a crochet mallet. My hunting rifle is camo. Is it really so important to you that there aren't weapons in the atomic shop that you are willing to pretend that the ones there are "skins"?
---
There might be truth to this i had my explosive equipped and got an explosive fixer. Going to try it again next sale.
---
If you're using Nexus mods and are not trying to cheat. Pretty easy... You know when you shouldn't be doing something.
---
They like the nexus mods and look to implement someof the top ones.
---
They could ban you... But then they would ban most pc users. They go after exploits not inventory management.
---
I don't do that shit. A level 116 One Hand melee master. I only used the PA for the drop. 
---
 Normally I am so invisible they just lose track. Any way a 40% Speed Furious Combat Knife that goes out at 150, becomes 200 right away, and that's at maybe 4 times a sec. ;)
---
Yeah, I just dont know if a at home computer has the power to support things like this. It can for awhile, but its not designed to.  Server crashes are fairly regular ime with personal hosting of servers.
---
Yeah I feel like Bethesda here is repeatedly stumbling about without bothering to look at what's working for ZOS, who I'm pretty sure did help somewhat with Fallout 76.
---
I personally cannot understand anyone paying for private servers for a game where the developer cannot even hold consistent patching without breaking things that the previous patches "fixed".....
---
and modsupport is just going to be another money milking process in the works as you absolutely cannot trust anything what the bethasda pops out......
---
Nah. They just think Bethesda can do no wrong and that if you aren't happy with every single little thing that Bethesda does, you must be a hater. All while completely missing the fact that the less people who play, the sooner their absolutely flawlessly run game dies.
---
TS Gamma has been a favorite of mine for the same reason. The TS effect still doubles rad damage on it so it only takes about 4-5 hits to kill most players from full health if they're not in PA.  Most don't have any kind of rad resistance.  The fire rate on them is insanely high with the 25% FFR effect as well.
---
Yeah, no real content except little temp events and then paid, non-moddable private servers isn't going to bring people back, really.
---
But this seemed to be bound to happen.  They had said/shown almost nothing of Wastelanders since the E3 reveal and you'd think that such a huge update would be getting more fanfare as it gets closer to fall... and lo and behold we're getting a delay to sometime in 2020.
---
You can do this with cosmetics though.
---
Though out the year I've had a lot of crashing and blue screens. And it usually seems to have something to do with my inventory and how much the game has to track. At one point I had to drop half of the clothes I had collected just to use workbenchs. You might want to see about dropping or selling anything you don't need, and see if that helps. I think if they made clothing stack it would help a lot. Just a thought tho, I don't know anything for sure.
---
That is sadly the point. Somewhere a level four player is struggling with level twenties because they ventured too far; allow Bethesda to step in and give them # Stims to help with that rather than 20 Atoms! You? You are fine! But think of that player! Think of them while you buy ¬£7.99 of Atoms or grind ever decreasing rewards!
---
It is not bad placement.  You have the advantage of fighting the queen outside of rads if you place them properly.  I no longer nuke or search for mats to make stable flux....its a waste of time for me as I can get these items for cheap caps or out of the event.
---
Every person has different needs for their character depending on the level that they are at.  Currently, I need very little and have trouble getting rid of the caps I make in a day.
---
I am talking about backpack skins you buy from the atomic shop that you said are skins... even though they don‚Äôt meet our definition of skins... you are being inconsistent. Why aren‚Äôt you mad about the nuka cola backpack since it can‚Äôt be applied to a standard backpack through the modify menu?
---
They are skins lol.. just because the way you craft is different doesn‚Äôt change the fact they are a skin.
---
Just like a nuka cola backpack is a skin... so is the invader. It is exactly the same as a combat knife lol. It just looks different. The description even says it is a combat knife. 
---
Anyway, you are wrong. And I am done. Goodnight.
---
the reduction is only for the base weight of the weapon, nothing else..
---
If they do, I have a bridge I'd like to sell them as well.
---
I do use vanguard along with chameleon.
---
I am shifting my bloody heavy to junkie.  Unyeilding is great for bloody melee (str) and bloody rifle (per, agi, stealth) but heavy really wants stabilized, which requires PA, which eliminates unyeilding.  So the bloody benefits for heavy are pretty marginal.  Bottom line, Junkie gives most of the damage at 5x the health.
---
Happy cake day but where is your proof
---
Yea camp stash is bullshit for this "event"
---
It seems like it should cover the mods right?
---
I has since the last patch. It used to occur frequently months ago when going into workbenches or in power armor with tactical HUD mod. Then it was great for a while, now it happens fast traveling, going to vendors, workbenches, and stash boxes.
---
I'd be fine if they were just honest about it.
---
Please!
---
Also the game would probably benefit from a Steam launch + significant sale on the initial purchase price.  
---
Hell, maybe it wouldn't hurt to do an Atom Store sale next month or so to try and get a burst of revenue flowing in.  Possibly even put a discount on Atoms to tempt folks into paying more than they normally would (ESO does this at least once a year for its anniversary).
---
Guessing Steam launch won't happen til after Wastelanders though.
---
Damn I'm salty
---
Old music was way better
---
Fedoras? Yup.
---
Yeah.. we could just run it on our own machine like every other fallout
---
No. I‚Äôm not paying for shit.
---
That explains a lot actually
---
How much u want for it? U on ps4?
---
yeah, but it is left open for interpretation, sadly
---
None of this surprises me.  Bethesdas series of missteps along the entire road of Fallout 76 are Legendary.  Servers are not DLC and cost money,,,no surprise there. " Cosmetic only" is a tired marketing ploy, reviled by many and believed by few.  And who actually thought that after the wretched launch, myriad of false information, and outright lies that Wastelanders was going to launch next month?  Dont get me wrong, I play alot of FO76, but my fanboyism for Bethesda died with the Beta.
---
Maybe its Raul!
---
I cant tell you how many camps I visit that have the collectron and the fridge. It's obvious that people are speaking with their wallets, isn't it?
---
Would you rather it be impossable to become stronger regardless of time put in ?
---
they just were today
---
I personally dont buy anything but cosmetics, but I also just glaze over everything else and dont get bothered lol it doesnt get more than a shrug from me.
---
I don't think the game works like that anymore.  
---
Iirc from the dev blog about technical issues is that to facilitate multiplayer the server effective loads the terrain/enacts game rules for chunks around each player FOR the player.  
---
So unless you recoded the game to use each persons' local processing and some sort of PtP check/cross validation engine it would be difficult to replicate PtP.
---
i didnt agree to that
---
Any vanguard sturdy/heavy combat armor?
---
Gotta be honest, I‚Äôm personally enjoying the hell out of the repair kits and my fridge
---
I've used it today
---
it would be very cool if toons that connect to private servers cant also use public servers
---
It's one of a hand full of the most sought after weapons in the game. You can get pretty much anything for it. Dont take caps
---
I didn't tho? I haven't wavered on my definition of skins. Skins are paint. Skins are modifiers. Different kinds of under armor aren't skins, they are different entities. I was never mad about there being weapons in the atomic shop, because the weapons there are trash? 
---
Okay, night night person who is strangely passionate about the weapons in the atomic shop being skins.
---
I doubt anyone's actually gonna play private servers. There are these people that ask for something like they can give their souls for it and when it's actually released, they immediately lose interest. I mean why would you want to play a single player version of an online game?
---
Lol. The idea that anyone was actually upset about that unstoppables thing is mind boggling.
---
Even though it's sarcastic, I really liked the tire walls although I don't like you have to use them on a really flat surface to keep them from floating.
---
No, it's all junk, hence vendor bot.
---
Lifesaving regenerating and such with underwater breathing fall damage and other assorted useless effects
---
Don't pretend what little they are doing makes it ok for them to ignore bugs that have been in the game since Beta. People like you are why they aren't doing anything to fix them.
---
Paying for the fridge is free if you actually play the game.  And its also not required.  I have the atoms to buy it (which again I did not pay anything for) but I have no use for it so I won't buy it. 
---
I don't care if they charge for atoms, if someone has the disposable income to buy them then great!  Buy them and keep the development going and the servers running.  I'm not going to but I'm glad others are.  If you don't want to then don't and stop complaining about it.
---
I would rather it company that can make their deadlines and produce a decent quality content. We have lowered the bar here so much and so often here i worry wastelanders will be 1 week of content and then a 2 year drought
---
A nuka cola backpack is not a modifier... you cannot modify a backpack to add a nuka cola skin...
---
LMAOOOOOOOO
---
You could have server hopped when you saw where the nuke was going. Also it shouldn‚Äôt be that hard now to repair. I thought repair costs were dramatically decreased
---
The point of the private servers from what I understand is to allow people to host their own servers and establish rules and whatnot for them, kind of like Rust and stuff. At least that's how I took the announcement.
---
I have u all beat i got a full set of golf clubs one day and i dont even play golf..lol
---
No one has ever been banned for a damage glitch by Bethesda so that's bull crap and also I dont use it, we were just experimenting. You've been hostile this whole time for no reason. Calm yourself.
---
Hell, man, if I‚Äôd known I‚Äôd have been honored to give my second copy to the man, the myth, the legend!
---
Hmm, yeah, that doesn't sound like a skin then. That kinda sounds like a different entity. It being craft, not modify.
---
I'd also like to note: I think that the non-cosmetic items they've included in the Atom Shop should be natural in-game items.  
---
I respect that the devs need a source of income, but I think that the Atom Shop should be reserved for premium, kickass skins or decor- such as the Four Horsemen PA skins or the Mothman Statue. Things that don't affect gameplay whatsoever.  
---
The plushies are also pretty nice.
---
It goes without saying, but is worth mentioning, that I believe the daily Atom Challenges are way too complex, unlikely, or vary in difficulty on a scale of Radroach to SBQ to serve as viable sources of Atom Point income.
---
Feel free to argue or agree. I'm interested in seeing people's general response.
---
I too play with this faction. Lots of queens, some encrypted, other stuff. Great group of folks.
---
Project P is just not fun.......radkelp has not spawned is sufficient numbers last week to even reach the second tier.  4 people farming and nothing.    That and it is just a confusing mess with no clear plan to do the quest.   
---
I have followed the steps to get the backpack three times now and had zero luck.  And yes, my teammates got it for doing the same steps.
---
Hey buddy! Haha
---
There was an interview with some of the game devs a few months back that I seem to recall them addressing this in a small way. They basically said that they would put community ideas into the atom shop with their own spin on it. Like repair kits came from people asking for a way to repair away from work benches, fridges were asked for constantly as where robot companions. I feel like if it was a utility item they were planning any way it will end up in the base game like backpacks and the brew stuff but if it isn't in their vision of the game it will go into the atom shop
---
I just learned the plan i bought and got an explosice fixer first roll today, didnt complete any challenges
---
I'd rather people realize that there are multiple ways to be at a disadvantage when it comes to this game.
---
Drop that server, such a douchebag move on their part
---
I want i want i want!!!! Nice pick!!!
---
Well you see, that would be logical and actually involve a thought process that doesn't involve, "WE MUST MAKE ALL THE MONEY!" Why introduce a QOL item for free, when you can sell it? The fridge and collectron could have been earned by killing a tough enemy or beating a new event that would actually feel worthwhile for your players. Instead Bethesda would prefer to prey upon those who don't have the time to earn atoms so they have to buy it with real money.  
---
Bethesda's just going to go forward introducing even more items for convenience to players like ammo or food converters. We won't be able to earn them though because then they can't make any money off of it. It's not directly paying to win in that you're getting more damage or protection (So their defenders will keep believing the lie). However, it is paying to avoid or lessen the numerous grinds in the game that they put in place. (They nerfed ammo crafting early on in the game) Just like they create artificial scarcity for the atomic shop to drive up sales, "Get it before it goes away into the vault!"  
---
I didn't take part in the second part of Clean Appalachia and don't intend to take part during the Purveyor sale either because it's all just a discount on a grind. "Oh yay! We now get twice as many tries at the RNG machine!" It's all bs to keep you playing so that you'll eventually get curious and visit the atomic shop.  
---
If Bethesda let us actually earn the QOL items through events or killing new enemies (let us hunt refrigerator robots from FO4 for parts to build our own refrigerators) and then sold skins for them on the atomic shop, I'd be fine with that. This isn't likely to happen going into Fallout 76's future though. I hate to think what filler "content" we'll even possibly see in the next five to six months. Yes I believe they will push Wastelanders back to March to get as much time as possible because it's Bethesda. The funniest thing is it'll still have bugs.
---
Was an easy way to hit my daily cap limit though
---
Today i got 5 weapons with the ghoul slayer prefix in a row, why that don't happen with bloodied or explosive ?
---
I highly doubt the programmers are deliberately ignoring specific bugs because some people on Reddit think they are doing things.
---
I really doubt anything like that's actually gonna happen unless it's built in the game itself or Bethesda start allowing some heavy modding on private servers. Have no idea how private server's gonna work but I think it's gonna be used for some solo-group farming or some cradle for exploits
---
Getting the fridge for free is only justification for the price gouging that is charging $6.36 for it otherwise.
---
So a multimillion dollar company cannot afford to hire these people?  I call bullshit.  If the paving guys are behind schedule on my local highway, they put an extra shift on it to get it done on time.  But hey, we need to "polish" it.......hahahahaha
---
That would be totally okay too since you can just store the letters and change them when you re-place them
---
Maybe like vanguard armour + vampire weapon if you want to be able to take hits and have thoes longer battles
---
the vault raid is what i would consider content, and that was done so poorly its kind of laughable.
---
Damn you must have been charging a fortune.
---
&gt;Your content updates have really \*lacked\* the last while, so I can't  exactly say they've kept the game feeling 'fresh and exciting'
---
I really feel like this point deserves a special mention.  The reason why cynicism runs high is because Bethesda hasn't given its audience something they are proud to support anymore.  The Burrows, the Vault Raids, the incessant tweaks that extend the grind at any cost, the bundles, the pay-for-convenience junk, all of this half-assed nonsense really takes its toll.  And then you come to us, saying how you're going to explore deeper depths in your panhandling, and it should come as no surprise that your fanbase scoffs.
---
Another Redditor said something a few days back that has reverberated with me.  To paraphrase, no one is going to spend money on a dead game.  What happens after Wastelanders?  Where will it be in a year?  Can any of us say, with confidence, that they won't simply pull the plug?  Why would I spend money on Atoms then?  Bethesda has to watch out, because if that whiff of death takes hold, it turns into a spiral.  How do you reverse it?  With good, high-quality content.  The likes of which they have failed to provide for *months*.
---
Yeah but I like the idea of just seeing Camp after camp with neon letters that say tightywhiteyman
---
Dank!
---
congrats nice gun
---
I was like üò≥!!!
---
That‚Äôs awesome lmao, the effort it took to be a dick is hilarious. That‚Äôs why I love this game.
---
push back in 2020 means a reboot !
---
Wtf....I struck out hard today, congrats! That‚Äôs a hell of a roll!
---
If people don't care, like you clearly don't, why would they bother?
---
Thanks man. I feel bad almost because I didn‚Äôt grind for script
---
You'd be lucky if you caught that, more likely in catching a Mirelurk and it ripping your face off.
---
Yup, not me
---
Frankly, I think they are basing this off sales numbers and nothing else which is a problem. A lot of the content in the atom shop is recycled or overpriced, but not all of it. The stuff that isn't is the stuff that sells. I see plushies, I see cool power armor skins, I see wallpaper and other stuff in the wild. The trailer, the greenhouse, raider and free states items. People don't just want utility items, they want unique items that are fun and/or fit in with the world. The collectron, people love because it's basically a silly robot pet, not because it collects a pitiful amount of junk. The fridge likewise would probably sell fine even if it didn't preserve food just so people could make kitchens. Wallpaper could have just been sold as different wall types though it's admittedly better this way. TLDR Bethesda needs to realize that sales numbers don't tell the whole story.
---
TBH this is the most neutral subreddit on the game. But yeah, it really does suck. Hopefully they'll see the backlash and reverse this decision.
---
Hopefully this helps:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_primary_statistics
---
Depends on what all we can do.  If I can make the entire map all high level spawns, make it where we go from dusk to pitch black night (like that fo4 mod) to dawn and not do daylight, and still get normal XP, yup, I‚Äôd do that.
---
I bought it months ago and haven't used it.
---
Wait... are you saying you actually buy repair kits? Or the fridge to ‚Äúremain competitive‚Äù? Lol
---
What did you learn tho?
---
How about random maps?
---
If you're on xbox I'll give you 20k caps and a bunch of other stuff.
---
We didn't NEED dedicated servers from Beth. We NEED servers we can host ourselves. The reason we wanted it wasn't cheating or whatever else people keep confusing, it's because the lag is fucking unbearable and even when you're the only person on a server you still lag. I want the choice to not have lag. Now they want me to pay to play in a slightly less laggy environment? NOPE. Thanks. Not what we all wanted though.
---
thats reason #1 why they shouldnt..
---
Shielded yes. You have to buy the actual underarmour from the bunker tho. No plans available as of yet.
---
What, yall have never nuked someone for having an empty punchbowl?
---
Did you read the entire post? GTAO servers are peer-to-peer, which means that they are hosted by people's computers and therefore are free.
---
This saves money on Rockstar's part, but it ruins many people's experience because of the increased latency guests have and the unfair advantage hosts have.
---
I‚Äôm on PS4
---
Eh, he'd rather stomp his feet on Reddit. But yes, costs to repair were reduced, even cheaper with the mag that cuts repair cost by 50%. It's not like it's a stealth nuke. üòÇ
---
Basically. I see a lot of people saying "oh but they're not really that useful". It always starts small, first unstoppables, then scrap kits, protectrons and fridges, and now bethesda's straight up confirmed they're only gonna add more and more.
---
That's how it starts with a lot of greedy developers, start with something small and normalize it, so by the time we start seeing ammo scrappers and weapons on the atomic shop we're all used to it.
---
It's not that bad for now, but it's not gonna stay this way, it never does.
---
Im on way to conplete those myself so i cant say for what i can say is the kill challenges seem to be shrinking im on the robots ive only got around 5 left
---
Me too actually
---
How is it p2w if they are exactly the same as in game items? I highly doubt this will ever happen. Some people really are making this a bigger deal than it is. I commend them for putting out a statement. Everyone was mad they didn‚Äôt acknowledge these utility items before.
---
I have a feeling it will be the ammo converters that turn the corner from just a slight convenience to very useful 'utility' shop items. We'll just have to wait and see.
---
That's depressing.
---
I hope that's true but I feel like we're in a 'fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me' scenario at this point. Plenty of people joined up for the free Nuclear Winter play and still found a buggy main game with little do long-term besides build. I hope you're right on this but I feel like Bethesda has burned through any goodwill they've built up with the average video game fan.
---
You think private server exploits would occur that would be worse than past issues?
---
Consoles have mods. PlayStation limits it but on Xbox Fallout 4 is moddable without paying anything. Even PS4 has a ton of really useful QOL mods even if they can't have the cool free costumes and textures.
---
Yeah I've been struggling to stay on board lately, but have done under the assumption that Wastelanders was coming in a few weeks... I really don't know if I can make it up to 5 months without losing interest. Also, I've got Last of Us 2 and FFVII Remake coming out in quarter 1 so, yeah... Not looking good.
---
Yup. I got all five in one go on that event once as well! Lady luck was on your side!
---
But it's totally useless on a melee weapon.
---
&gt;You cant take your legendary combat knife and apply the skin to it, s
---
Wait a sec...is your argument that the AS is P2W is that they had a weapon that is inferior and that you cant even get as a legendary? Dewd...just go away with your tail tucked in already
---
Because I do care? And I imagine the majority of the playerbase cares. Hell, Bethesda cares. A lot of them play the game.
---
You're acting like I am telling you they don't need to fix these bugs or that it's fine they haven't. All I said to you originally is that they were doing plenty of work in response to your accusation that they were doing nothing.
---
I want this game to succeed so bad but this delay has really killed my interest. No new content for essentially 6 months is brutal.
---
Exactly what I was trying to do
---
It's really more about a betrayal of trust than the items themselves. You are correct that these items are just barely useful, if that, but they are non-cosmetic, something we were told would not be on the shop.
---
I intentionally avoid games with non-cosmetic shops. I bought this game believing there wouldn't be any. Now they have gone back on that and I feel swindled.
---
Come off it.  The event is easy and the literal second it takes to let everyone get a shot in is worth nothing.  When everyone in the room is throwing angry emotes at you that should clue you in that you're being selfish.  
---
That bar wouldn't be nearly as full if fewer people showed up to the event, and everyone wants something out of it.  We're all participating for something and at the very least waiting a second still nets your plenty of opportunity to get what you want.  But being inconsiderate denies others the opportunity to benefit from what is clearly a collective effort.  
---
You can play the game however you'd like, it's totally fair and valid, but it still makes you an ass for not considering what others are after.
---
get 2 stars- twice the total rolls, 1.75 times the crap, and 25 percent more good weapons. I got a bloodied gatling gun, a JE single action, and some other goodies
---
I look forward to seeing more of my irradiated, 19% health kinfolk.
---
What seems really odd to me is why not just give players the plain old bot and fridge and then sell skins for them. I would think there would be more money in that.
---
I haven't seen many camps without a fridge so.....
---
It's weird. My main got some decent stuff but my alt, nothing
---
I mean the music is pretty awesome I don‚Äôt see why people liked the original so much but everyone has their own opinion. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I loved the launch day and the wild Appalachia screens, whenever I got kicked due to some bug I found myself listening to that
---
Because being able to buy a weapon instead of farming it is the highest lvl of p2w. I don't think anyone is making a big deal. People have them the benefit of a doubt on the fridge and collector and see how that turned out? Cash grab. 
---
Almost everyone I know with a friends list of over 100 is gone and done with this game. Maybe wastelanders will bring some back, but with the competition releasing and their eagerness to drive farther into p2w territory, I doubt many will return.
---
According to who the corporate asshats?
---
Bloodied builds are lame at unless your going undetected constantly. These AR builds with bloodied just sound unfun I'd rather build into resistances and just be a walking tank with a gun.
---
fish adds range and acid damage
---
The house always wins.
---
Just don't mess with my Unyielding armor and Idgaf what they do. Not even for the combat benefits, but for the extra carry weight, higher intelligence (better chance of learning plans when scrapping and faster xp gain), better vendor prices from Charisma and being able to run great distances without running out of AP super fast.
---
I seriously doubt it. There is a reason this announcement was lacking in details beyond what was stated: there aren't any other details to give, it's just pay money for the ability to play with only you and some friends on the same map under the same rules.
---
The thing is, if people didn't like them selling utility items in the atom shop, then why is every camp I go to have a collectron or a fridge? It seems like people are buying into it, and from a business standpoint, they are going to want to add more of those items because in numbers they ARE successful. Besides all the people saying they don't like them, I see the same people with these items in their camps. I'm not saying I agree with them, but ONLY from a business standpoint does this really make sense to me. Juicehead made a video today talking about this and I haven't been as mad at Bethesda than I have everyone else really. Because yes, we don't want these items, but from the amount of people I see on Xbox with the very same items, shows me people are still buying them. If we don't want them to make more of these products, everyone needs to stand by their word and not buy them. It'll be hard when the ammo converter comes out, but if those numbers go down they will physically see that they aren't selling. But as of right now, everyone basically owns a fridge or collectron so they are counting it as they won
---
You should build around weapon classes rather than specials would be my advice. High Charisma is good if you play cooperatively a lot, otherwise most people just sink four points to get lone wanderer and then swap in other cards as needed. You need intelligence for building weapons and armor, but also nerd rage if you run a bloody build, and demolitions if you have an explosive weapon. Luck is super important for vats heavy builds that use a lot of crits. It also has the perks for mutations and bloody mess which everyone (I think) uses. 
---
After that you either assign more points to either strength if you are a heavy gunner, shotgunner or melee, or perception if you are a rifle, commando or (maybe?) gunslinger. Agility is useful for all builds.
---
amen
---
I actually like the questlines to earn something I want, like escavator for example(although its short) nothing made me log in faster than spending 100s of atoms for a fridge.
---
That‚Äôs worth some pretty good caps. Congrats!
---
I‚Äôm upset because the closest fix to one of my main problems in this game is to pay money. This also doesn‚Äôt mean I have any better connection than on the normal servers. They announced this game as ‚Äúbeing able to play it single player‚Äù, however I cannot due to connection issues. If it can be played solo, why can‚Äôt I play on a single player world. Even if that removes the vendors, PvP, griefing, etc. I still don‚Äôt care, it is incredibly hard for me to play this game and make any real progress other than moving two steps and DCing three seconds after.
---
We only have a year and 3 months until the next console cycle and to me, that's when it'll die. When everyone moves onto the next console. And with the PS5 coming out to not fully be backwards compatible, tells me by itself that the game might not last as long as... ESO has, per say. I want it too, but I'm just afraid that cycle change is gonna change the gaming world.. or keep it the same.
---
No they werent survival completely different from private server mods could be a huge problem depending on which ones but the main thing would be the admin commands
---
You can host your own servers on Minecraft. Realms doesn‚Äôt replace that, it‚Äôs just an easier way to run a server. Many paid servers don‚Äôt even go to Mojang besides realms.
---
Hell I'm not that kind.  I'd also like the plans that drop from the event and I've got other crap to do with the time I have to play the game.  I still give people at least the chance to make it over and pop a shot off.
---
Thanks, what do you think it could get?
---
You're right but this might become a problem when they add the mods support.
---
It‚Äôs a weapon worth building around. I went bloodied after getting and bloody explosive handmade and have never looked back. The damage output is phenomenal and with unyielding armor the boosts to other specials mean I can one shot most things with melee if I run out of bullets!
---
I would love a bloodied fixer, but my explosive vampire fixer will do in the meantime!
---
I really wish they would bring in some people from ZeniMax to help them with the shop balancing. The crown store they set up in ESO, along with the premium membership, is what I was hoping the atomic shop would be patterned after. Granted ESO didn‚Äôt launch with anything like what the crown store is now, but you would think they would have tried to learn lessons from another ‚Äúpartnered‚Äù title to keep from having to spend more than a year in the trial and error phase like they have been doing. The atomic shop feels like an over priced thrift store in comparison to what ESO has. Kind of flabbergasting.
---
That too.  'course the easy argument is "well other games sell outfits for the same or higher".
---
Yes, how?
---
-not a Bethesda dev.
---
I haven‚Äôt played this game in a few months but I‚Äôve been keeping up with the news. I ended up quitting out of lack of things to do and was planning on coming back for the wastelands update. With this being pushed back to next year, I think it‚Äôs just another one of the many nails in the coffin.
---
I just roll with it. It's on a rotation anyway and they'll eventually get around to putting them on sale.
---
Including all the games that actually died.
---
Are you sure there's a way? Because one of the major hurdles in making 76 was that the Creation engine relied on loading around a singular PC (that they nicknamed "Atlas" for having the world on its shoulders). It took a lot of effort just to decouple the world from the PC so that it could be persistent and allow for multiple player characters.
---
It seems to me that they might not be able to make a version of 76 that worked with just P2P or whatever.
---
Ya know, I was about to make a sarcastic comment like "what are you talking about, it was added in patch 13. It's just that no one can seem to find it". Then was going to ask if they ever mentioned why that was in the patch notes, but not in the game; however I just pulled up the patch 13 notes to make sure I got that bit right and after rereading it I've come to the conclusion that I (and several others I've seen on this sub) misunderstood/misinterpreted the patch notes. See below
---
&gt; **Main Menu Music:** Players can now choose to lower the volume on or mute the Main Menu music while queued. 
---
While queued??? WTF good does that do?!?!?! The only time I've ever even been queued at the main menu was trying to join a friends full server and even that didn't last long. Should be the same quote without "while queued". Apparently on my initial reading of the notes, I must've gotten halfway through the sentence said "cool" and moved onto the next bullet point.
---
I think the Advent of Survival, RPG and other possibly semi changed (something akin to Battlefield) servers, it'll keep people on board. I'd really hope that the server price isn't something stupid.
---
Roflrofl... 
---
Outer Worlds on the 25th dude!
---
It's not in the game because it's sore inconsistency.
---
I quit months ago and am only still subbed here to rubberneck as the ship sinks.
---
But only if it's in the atom shop. it's what the players want after all.
---
Trust me it‚Äôs duped, it doesn‚Äôt need to be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù they just need to make poison resistance a viable (or frankly functional) armor/legendary effect.
---
Not gonna lie... I want that Enemy Deterrent.
---
Man those dupes really screwed everything up. Can't believe they let so many stay in the game.
---
Its not duped
---
The Station didn't show in the map because it takes some time for it to load. Remember: it was added later.
---
I know I can't wait lol I still haven't played the recent tomb raider, so I might play that until Outer Worlds
---
You‚Äôd be surprised
---
I agree with you but funny thing is today I saw more new players then I ever have in a single day. I check every 2-5 level persons GT to see if they are really new or just a new toon. I gave away at least 6 care packages to newbies. I had to check the xbox game pass to see if it was on there now. Lol
---
Edit: BTW Fallout New Vegas in on the game pass!
---
Steal it from the dev room.
---
Yeah not all mineshafts are open. So there could already be an underground city in the Ash heap without us knowing. I'm talking lore wise ofcourse.
---
My Fixer 38 does the perfect amount of damage. Most of the time, melee and unarmed dorks are the problem, because they don't nerf themselves by switching perks or equipping lesser weapons.
---
Ehh I‚Äôm probably going to keep it for now to mess around with
---
It's a baseless claim
---
Yea got an AAE minigun that went from 2 pounds to 10 after mods. Guess it‚Äôs better than the alternative
---
Someone once entered.So he can copy many whatever he want how many
---
I whole heartily agree with you're position on this matter, good sir. Yes, here here,  consume a bushel of phallus, bethesda!
---
eh. Don't really want to take it THAT far. Bethesda makes cool games and is way too interesting to simply ignore. I mean we are finally getting an ambitious space RPG and you want me to just NOT be into that?  Still, I meant like maybe just specifically not playing 76 anymore for a while or something.
---
Again you‚Äôd be surprised
---
I think /u/riomaki said it best in another thread: 
---
"To paraphrase, no one is going to spend money on a dead game. What happens after Wastelanders? Where will it be in a year? Can any of us say, with confidence, that they won't simply pull the plug? Why would I spend money on Atoms then? Bethesda has to watch out, because if that whiff of death takes hold, it turns into a spiral. How do you reverse it? With good, high-quality content. The likes of which they have failed to provide for months."
---
Thanks for this.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm always looking for a better non auto rifle. Message me.
---
in that case, that should be true for all innate explosive weapons that are twoshot. They actually get treated as totally separate projectiles. That also means two-shot innate explosives weapons do far more damage than you‚Äôd think- effectively double. Because the ‚Äú25% damage‚Äù nerf is applied to the direct-impact component of innate explosive weapons, not the explosion, which is the vast majority of their damage. 
---
Ex: a mininuke does 10 direct impact damage (ie if the mininuke actually collided with you) and 300 explosives damage (to everything in the radius).
---
A two-shot mininuke does 1 shot at 10 direct damage and 300 explosive damage, and a second at 2.5 direct damage and 300 explosive damage.
---
I‚Äôm somewhat surprised that that is the case, though. I‚Äôd figure they would have just reused the slap-damage formulas, which capped damage on a ‚Äúper second‚Äù basis.
---
Ok. You know all those people posting about losing accounts were hacked because they downloaded dll injectors right? May be a bit slow on the dupe side of things for a bit.
---
Still quite a ways off getting into the bunker. I'll have to check player vendors, managed  to get a lot of stuff that way
---
They charged 7 dollars for a fucking refrigerator so I'm not confident.
---
Hi not confident., I'm dad.

I think that would be pretty cute tbh, since it seems none of the Mole Miners are actually able to speak due to because infused with their suits. So pretty much every resident dialogue in the proposed city would likely largely consist of (Mumbling), (Deep Breathing), (Confused Mumbling), (Slightly Annoyed Mumbling) and somehow our character will clearly understand all of what they're saying
---
If I did sell it it would be for way more than that to be honest.
---
I can give you both &amp; help with your quest line if you would like.
---
Correct. Have a ts auto that was good indoors cause they cant jump away. I dont have ts missile launcher tho.. Been trying.
---
BAD BOT
---
Nobody in the world wanted this, I‚Äôve never seen anyone ask or discuss this.  It‚Äôs just been massive backlash to these items.
---
Got this game earlier this year after all the bad press and everything. I knew what I was getting myself into. Played for a about two months very casually, only making it to level 22 or so before moving on to other games. Came back to it recently thinking that Wastelanders was gonna drop soon and I'm currently level 58. I've had a lot more fun playing the game than I originally did, but I'm already to the point where the main thing to do is grind for legendary weapons, which isn't that appealing to me. I already have a decent ultracite gatling laser and power armor, both using fusion cores which is the only thing I need to grind for and some junk to repair my stuff every now and then. 
---
Basically, I'm really disappointed by this delay and I don't know if I'll be coming back to this game for any considerable length of time even when Wastelanders drops. Too many games coming out at the end of this year and the beginning of next year that will occupy a lot of time. I fear that this game is already in the death spiral with the lack of content that has been produced since launch. Lack of players spending money = lack of content = lack of players spending money = lack of content. Wastelanders seems to be the last attempt to fix all the stuff that should have been in at launch, but I fear that it is already kind of too late for a rebirth at this point unless they really deliver something special in Q1.
---
Are you running this in PVP? Or do you just hate power armor that much? Stabilized is such a powerful perk for a HW build. 
---
In PVP I‚Äôd guess junkies is a better bet (5 times the health is significant) but I never bothered with PVP.
---
I yet have to see someone losing a workshop battle because he didn't have repair kits. Or someone dying because he had no food and no refrigerators. 
---
I don't like what they do, but it Is not pay to win. It Is just bad taste, greedy and that.
---
Sorry i have two explosive fixers i got from purveyor trying to build certain characters,  i wouldnt sell them for more than that but its cool no worries.
---
The truth is... and yes i know it sounds cringy, but the truth is we deserve something as fans who were promised content and dlc. We promote the game pretty hard here.
---
Or the rare jumpsuits! I got the shielded raider plans once.... didn‚Äôt even notice for a day.
---
üëçüèΩ
---
I completely agree, thank you for your insight. There's too much competition in the market to go dark content-wise for half a year.
---
Ok fair, but that's 700 atoms which could be earned in game. You compare they're prices to something like Apex Legends and honestly it's not that bad.
---
Yeah, 20k is *way* too low for a 3* Fixer that's *also* explosive. You can easily sell it for around 50k-60k Caps/Ammo, or trade it for several high-end pieces of gear
---
yeah, a separation of 'official normal' servers and 'official private' servers would eliminate the need of the latter as you and your group would have to start over and in case of Vault raiding would need a lot of work if people want their god-tier legendaries again
---
Im wiling to bet most people who bought those bots used free atoms and bethesda is saying most popular category to fluff public perception
---
It is. Can bring down the weight of handmades and assault rifles by 8lbs or so.
---
PC? I think I have one on a mule. I‚Äôve pretty much given up in the game (haven‚Äôt played since July). I‚Äôll think about (updating...) and logging in if you want it.
---
I approve
---
Definitely lol I know my way around the market for sure hAha
---
There are also some other server hosters that they could have cooperated with that offer easier service and the same options as if you would host a server yourself
---
Also in which game do you have 'threats' of other people connecting to your server? ever heard of passwords and whitelists?
---
The main problem is maybe the fact we can one shot 0/1 stars and 3 stars at equal ease, i'd enjoy tougher legendaries because when you read "Legendary" you don't feel like, Oh shiet, a tough fight incoming, no no you're more like " A loot bag 3 star over here, come on mates hit him once before i one shot him"
---
About Uranium Fever, i close every sounds, i keep only voices and maybe footsteps to spot quickly the molemens, and i bash it then emote , if i can't reach him because someone one shot him or keep shooting with is automatic weapon, i go full power.
---
Things change. Happens all the time. The more people buy from atomic shop, the more they will add
---
I guess next we'll get weapons and armor in the shop, because somehow - I can't even explain why- people in this game tend to use those when fighting enemies....so they'll try to profit from that too with that reasoning
---
I don't know what my 60 dollars have paid for. To be honest, I have been playing since release, More than 1000 hours and still enjoying it. 
---
I Will not pay por private servers, like I haven't bought atoms using real money. Since I am on PS4 I pay a service for the right to play the game, but that's as far as I can go. 
---
Each one of us will do what we consider acceptable, and that's it.
---
I got it at beta but was very sceptical and thought I would request a return before release. But it hooked me. Maybe it was that time I was walking down the tracks at night and got ambushed by super mutants as the beach Boys popped on the radio; had no idea that song was in the radio. But I think it was the mistress of mystery quest that really hooked me in. Glad It did too. I've had a great time exploring the huge and detailed Appalachian wasteland. Got a friend hooked on it too and now it's like going on a camping trip. 
---
To be fair, my pc has run this game very well for the most part but as someone who played NewVegas on ps3, I understand the complaints and appreciate that even fans are finally holding Bethesda feet to the fire about these problems. 
---
I get why some don't like it and wouldn't even if it ran smooth from the start: it doesn't have the branching story line, companions, proper vats, and a few other things you expect in a Bethesda rpg. But the elements they did include were really well done: giant map packed with little stories you discover, epic battles with weird mutants, rewarding leveling, and that fallout/twilightzone atmosphere. I'm very pleased with my full price purchase.
---
Hi i don't know what my 60 dollars have paid for. to be honest, i have been playing since release, more than 1000 hours and still enjoying it. 
---

---
each one of us will do what we consider acceptable, and that's it., I'm dad.
---
I labelled mine free junk and let anyone take it.
---
It fucking used to be like that!! But no, now you just don't get your camp on that server. Switch to a different one
---
Hell ya man. If you come back let me know. Love me some demolition weapons. Held on to a couple AA lasers and it finally got fixed months later. Hoping they will separate explosive weapons from explosive effect so they can be properly balanced.
---
Cry me a river lol
---
Yeah, it's the principle. The fridge is strictly worse than a refrigerated backpack, the Collectron is strictly worse than a junk pile and the repair kits are strictly worse than the SBQ's kits...But it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
---
Again, baseless
---
This game will finally be put to rest the minute Outer Worlds is released. October 25.
---
Is that still an issue, hahaha holy shit.
---
To note: they broke all the power armor mods like 6 months ago. A couple weeks later they mostly fixed it, but for some reason the X-01 helmet mods were still broken. (Note:self created, not vendor bought). They were still broken when I quit in July. 
---
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs *still* an issue, but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised- it‚Äôd be par for the course, and a big reason why I quit (the lack of concern about bug fixes)
---
Yeah last patch
---
I only had about 200 scrip to play with but I got some really good rolls. AA +DMG +AGL Handmade, Stalker + VATS + VATS Handmade, Vampires +swing speed +AGL Revolutionary sword.
---
Holy shit, they finally fixed armor penetration on energy weapons?
---
Where do people get the idea server hosting is very expensive? It isn't, especially for a big company.
---
This is good news for people who expected more of mmo lite expiernce. Instead they have catered to the i want to play alone crowd.
---
Game need ls hard limits/ classes/  super unique build specific items/ super rare crafting/ camp storage bumps for people willing to pay. Im looking forward to it
---
Exactly, this guy gets it. Im kinda tired of people whinning because they cant figure out the game or how to build a proper build with the right gear. As soon as you perfect your end game person youre op and a dick for killing everything in 1 shot. Thats what the end game is and what everyone should aim for. Im not carrying around a weaker gun for someone elses beneifit, thats weight that can be used for something more useful...like scrap. I honestly try not to kill everything in 1 shot but most the time it just happens based on how high adrenaline is and other misc factors like if gunfu lags and before i know it everything is dead and players are pissed. It happens, but i definetly dont feel bad when it does. Why hold back? So by the time i decide to get a shot its dead and im left in the dust lol. Meatweek was another prime example. The events were timed, sometimes the event wasnt completed because everyone was trying to hold back so everyone could get a shot, that pissed me off when i know for damn sure i could do any of them by myself with time to spare to help with another that was going on. I have multiple builds, even my least op is considered op to the people who have done events with me and that ones a stealth commando with only the first rank of each rifle and maybe bloody mess if i want immediate damage over crit damage. Its the adrenaline and gunfu that gets me in trouble lol. I couldve hiked up the damage way up like most but didnt for a challenge and survivabilty and yet im still op?? I think some people should maybe look over their build again when people are looking to see what im using only to find a basic fixer....and thats happened many times until i got better combat rifles, now shit really hits the fan üòÖüòà
---
Ye.. Same with tank killer. Lasers and plasma are back! And stabilized
---
for only 1499 Atoms!
---
even some of the smaller 50mb mods for FO4 brought more content than 76 did by now
---
Add another 20 to that number from today.... Still no fixers from her.
---
Since they have been very vague about the private servers I feel like its not going to be what players think. Imagine getting a private server then being able to grind out workshops and loot all places, making millions of rounds then returning to sell in public servers. I feel like bethesda wont allow this. Imagine how fast u could level up and all the legendaries u could get. Im just thinking it wont work hopping between public and private servers. Maybe im wrong i guess we will see soon.
---
You know, bally tenpenny ones dropping in the custard!
---
I love hearing this instead of complaints. In a sense, you did win a big jackpot. Congrats!
---
I got a B/vats and a J/E/15 Fixer today. I got the B/vats on my third roll, shouted FUCK YES, then just coasted with three star buys for the remainder of my scrip. I guess I could improve on a two star B/vats fixer, but that just leaves me something to do until Wastelanders comes along.
---
RNG is a numbers game, so I was prepared for the big sale. Putting in the extra mile has really been paying off lately. Last week I got a B/SS/90w meat hook from AWOL and a leather coat from Queen o/t Hunt. Both quests I nearly passed on because it was getting late, but the extra 10 min was well worth it.
---
Did he say that at E3 this year? If so, can you source it?
---
That‚Äôs the definition of pay to win, paying for better items or more storage.  Not everyone has the financial ability to buy the best weapons or armor.  I feel in a game it should be a level playing ground.
---
Nah I don't bother with PVP at all, just PVE. I don't use PA at all (with the exception of the Excavator suit in nuke zones) because of how restrictive it is. Yeah its strange to use HW without PA, since there's quite a few PA related perks in conjunction with using HW, but I don't like how PA strips you of your regular armor, which leaves legendary armor useless.
---
Yeah the shotgun is pretty op at crippling, basically why I use it.
---
So give us the tools to make our own servers with our own event rates and shit.
---
But no, you know they're going to make you pay for servers AND mods.
---
Aah... Those were the days... Slap damage, highest level players were power armor users while at level 37 and cool guys could kill you with the strongest weapons in game: the Dragon and All Rise.
---
Get over it people, let us enjoy our fridge and our repair kits...good Lord, if you don‚Äôt wanna spend money, GIT GUD an earn your daily caps
---
I kill everything as fast as possible but i give everyone a chance at legendaries. Its only 3 supervisors after all, not that hard to wait slightly longer.
---
ROFL I forgot about that "dont attack anyone under lvl 50 of you're over lvl 50"
---
Not only that but they NEED to add some new content.  Pushing back the next phase of the game to "Q1 2020" is not a good thing for a game that's been in a content drought for months already.
---
That‚Äôs OP
---
Um no. I find plenty to do and hit full servers all the time. I love this game and I've been playing from launch and only this game for the last year. You just gotta be willing to grind and trade.
---
You want things that cost Bethesda money for free.
---
The reason most people bought the fridge and the collectron isn't for their purpose of making food last long or collecting scrap. People wanted a fridge in their camp kitchen to make it look more like a kitchen and for most people the bot is just comic relief or something to tide them over NPC wise til wastelanders. I know about 100 people who play FO76 and less than 5% of them use the fridge and the bot for the actual reason they are in game for.
---
lol I think you killed me in NW last night.
---
Lmao badass, I just recently broke 100 and I run full X-01 75% of the time. Congrats!
---
To add to the list OP wanted: Factorio, Empyrion Galactic Survival, Hellion, Rising Storm 2:Vietnam, Red Orchestra 2, Starbound, Terraria, Stationeers...basically most games you can play multiplayer in has a way for you to host your own sessions on your own
---
Shoot that was E3 2018, my bad.
---
I'm fine with a paid OPTION as long as there is a free option for those who wants to host their own servers, not pay for a host.
---
Every high level can 1 shot. You dont even need godly gear to do that, just decent gear and perks. I always give everyone a chance at the legendaries.. its just being nice. But not everyone is nice, i get that lol.
---
Wouldn't you prefer this in-game? Honest question.
---
Normally, I'd give respect for skills period if they're respectable. Not in this case.  
---
It's getting tiring to have disingenuous acknowledgement of how Bethesda has messed up. It's one thing to admit it outright and not do anything about it, it's another to try to admit wrongdoing then claim it's because the community wanted these changes.  
---
No one in the community was clamoring for these convenience items in the Atom Shop. It was one of the main things being trashed on when they came out in this subreddit.  
---
If it's an attempt at gaslighting it's a bad one, because we have facts and statements from them to call them out on it.
---
You shot the wise Mothman?! You monster.
---
Ok
---
Ikr, Wastelanders delayed to next year Q1 is really crazy, it means they could delay it all the way to March which is 5 months away.
---
With the current content we have, and bugs and stuff, the player base will only keep dwindling.
---
Fridge could have been added via a quest or a new plan.  Then sell skins for the fridge.
---
I‚Äôd wait until it is ‚Äòabout to leave the vault‚Äô, may get 10% off if you‚Äôre lucky lol
---
How does it cost Bethesda money if I host it myself? O.o
---
Added all my rifleman perk cards and bloody mess and it‚Äôs doing about 100dmg a shot and added a reflex sight and piercing mag and it cuts through muties like butter
---
I would prefer for my instigating fucking shotgun to be capable of killing enemies as intended instead of causing some weird rebound damage, or the sentrybot sound effect to stop busting my balls, or maybe my bloodied lever action to stay bloodied in spite of the 250 damage reduction effect, but yeah, fishing should be included in the next update. 
---
This salmonless existence is making the game unplayable.
---
I agree, and on top of that, they've completely lost the potential holiday market.
---
I don‚Äôt play Survival bc I‚Äôve always found the PvP lacking in this game...so I‚Äôm just assuming these Atom Shop purchases are able to be used in this mode as well? If that‚Äôs the case, I agree with everyone that it‚Äôs a little too close to pay to play...but in adventure mode, y‚Äôall don‚Äôt have a leg to stand on. Let everyone play their games the way they want to play them.
---
Just wondering if you're in ps4? Im interested with the anti armor 50 cal lol... üòÇ
---
There were basically two main crowds of people interested in FO76 from the beginning - people who wanted to play Fallout with other players, and people who wanted to kill other players in a Fallout game. Seems like the first crowd made more noise about their side so that's the direction the game's going; frankly, that's the direction it seemed like it was always gonna take anyway so I don't get being so surprised about the lowkey status of PvP in this game.
---
Oh yeah, NMS is a great example of what I hope for 76. I usually compare it to Elder Scrolls Online, especially since that's Bethesda as well.  
---
I actually know exactly what you're talking about, I'm the same way with most games. To me, though, Bethesda games are the exception. I'm frequently starting new characters with older Fallout and Elder Scrolls games. For me, 76 is something I can always go back to because, all the online/games-as-a-service stuff aside, it's still Fallout.  
---
For you, though, maybe think about how you can throw in an hour or two of 76 into your gaming schedule when Wastelanders comes out. Unlike other games, just playing it for a little bit, maybe even to take brief breaks from whatever game you are focusing on at the time, works fine. And hey, maybe you'll dip your toes into the Wastelanders pool and see that the water is nice and get hooked again.
---
You don‚Äôt get kicked off / game freeze very often do you?
---
Not supporting the giving up part of the post BUT I blew through 600 scrip today full of 3* ghoulslayer bashing hunting rifles before I gave up and saved the rest of it for later
---
What‚Äôs your GT? I would be interested in frequenting your shop.
---
Yes, with all the other games competing during the holidays, Fo76 will only lose more and more grounds.
---
They can do something like Free Trials like before if they want to inject new players but for recurring players there has to be an update.
---
Higher Charisma gives you better deals at vendors, of course. But it gets you better rewards in group events.
---
Intelligence also earns you more XP. Even buffs like casual lined under armor or Brain Bombs.
---
Pay money, get a private server, claim all the workshops, get infinite undisputed wealth compared to a non paying player
---
I spent maybe 1000 scrip between all my five characters. Got like 4-5 God Tier weapons. 
---
Junkie 50 cal.
---
Junkie explosive 50 cal.
---
Instigating faster swing deathclaw gauntlet.
---
Junkie's Vats accuracy Vats low usage railway rifle.
---
Bloodied faster swing combat knife. 
---
Anti-armor explosive +1 per Pipe Bolt rifle.
---
And the one I liked better: bloodied higher criticals low weight hunting rifle.
---
yeah I agree with you and it's pretty suspicious (in accordance with OP's other observations) how they didn't mention the price of Atoms in the slightest with their 'analysis' of the Atomshop...
---
\*Insert Skinner meme\* "hm...could it be that Atoms are too expensive?.....No! We're just not selling enough pay for convenience items!"
---
I do enjoy the game, but at what point have I done all I can experience? I‚Äôve fought the SBQ, but do I need to have solo‚Äôed it? I‚Äôve hit the level cap for gear, but do I need to do it several times? There are raids, and as an MMO player I truly enjoy player trials and raids but from what I‚Äôve heard it is an effort in futility to attempt them due to lag and other problems. 
---
If the true end game is to trade and sell then that‚Äôs fine, thank god there definitely  isn‚Äôt a Legendary prefix that ranks above all others in the meta &gt;.&gt;
---
And a faster fire zealot +1 agility handmade.
---
Did he say it then, either? I thought it was someone else who said it
---
&gt; Our approach to these items at launch was to keep them purely cosmetic. But after looking at all the data, it became clear that to consistently deliver content that keeps Fallout 76 fresh and exciting for all, we needed to rethink our approach to the Atomic Shop.
---
This right here, is when Fallout 76 died. RIP you never had a shot.
---
Johnnyrebel27
---
I look forward to having you stop by its not fully stocked yet but it wont take long before it is
---
It‚Äôs just shady, Bethesda creates a problem then sells a convenient solution.  The original statement was that the shop would be strictly cosmetics, which has turned out to be a lie and there‚Äôs no backlash.  I‚Äôm all about supporting this game, it‚Äôs amazing and has some amazing people.  I buy atoms to support the game and I don‚Äôt even have anything to spend them on.
---
Ha that's lucky!
---
My point with the basic fixer, its the build that makes the gear work and my commando isnt even a max dam build...definetly a bonus if you have better then basic tho. I always give a chance at legendaries but when I become in danger all is fair game. I play in groups and events all the time, just tag them in vats real quick or do a spray and pray and move on with focus on legendaries, throw a grenade, i always keep some on me. Im not as bad as i sound lol, im always the guy helping downed players or if someone needs help in the wasteland i do what i can. Just people need to have better tactics instead of complaining. Ive been to events were people have 1 shotted and it does suck, but thats the game but im not gonna msg them and bitch because their build is "op".
---
No, I'm saying it would be necessary to play the most efficiently and would give you a competitive edge over those who dont have it. That's literally the fucking definition of a utility item, but you want to act like you didnt understand because you actually did buy atom points and want to justify it.
---
when did one tamriel drop?  thats wheni feel thhey really started to turn it around
---
I know it's rng and just bad luck but I hate how you can't just scrip everything. Waiting 2 weeks to scrip 40+ legendaries is ridiculous
---
The reason development swifted to no cosmetics items, was because of server instability. They have overloaded the atmo shop with CAMP items, but nobody buys them because they dont have budget in their CAMPS or just altogether dont use the feature. The things that people DO buy are the outfits and skins, but they are so overpriced its a turn off. So with all forms of resources thrown out the window, the natural step is take a PR nose dive, and go P2W, else they would have to eventually close down the project, which would be massive losses for them.
---
No it was definitely him, if you want I can search through 30 minutes of their panel to get it lol.  They definitely had the stance that it would be strictly cosmetics.
---
Ask any World of Tanks player what this announcement means.
---
(hint: it's called "gold rounds")
---
Lots of games are multiplayer. Minecraft and fortnight and wow and Mario kart are multiplayer. ‚ÄúMultiplayer‚Äù is not a description of a genre,
---
Now that's a great idea. I would love seeing how this would work out but I think it would sound like they are speaking inside of an apparatus. Maybe their breathing mask can finally let their grunts be heard and we can trade with them. They could have two types of mole miners. Normal and feral.
---
Why not play with a faction of players? I play in a huge one and changed my game play
---
Yes, I know...they said it would only be cosmetic, I get it...bad practices...but, backlash? I mean, nothings going to come from that. Did a fridge really fix a problem they created, in a survival style game where food is designed to spoil? All it‚Äôs doing is taking a little bit of grind out of a very grindy game.
---
Why do you think the game will only be around for three more months?
---
That would be great. I'm holding off the main quest line to level up a bit for the quest rewards to be higher level.
---
Bethesda doesn't care. The community let them pull this crap and even clapped when they did it. Now they know they can do whatever they want with little to no backlash. Hell this sub in particular let Bethesda pull crap after crap and clapped while they did it. Anybody who called out their mess was called a rage baiter, a hater, a grifter. Now here we are. Bethesda will shove as much p2w crap into the atom shop as they want because subs like this one let them. Instead of making a stink the community made posts about "everything people said about this game was wrong" and "I just got fo76 and it is amazing".
---
Why does it need to be flat?
---
I've build up at Seneca Rocks, and I love it. The view is the best.
---
You already know the answer to this.
---
They increased the rate that items spoiled before releasing it.  They increased the rate that weapons break and introduced repair kits. It‚Äôs not just speculation, the percentages were changed.
---
Yeah, I agree. We‚Äôve all been waiting since meat week lol I know The legendaries we‚Äôre burning a hole in my stash box...all for some garbage legendaries I could‚Äôve got from a single Golf Club run. I spent 17k on Fixer plans and another 2k on handmade just to roll something half usable and I got trash
---
I think Hats was saying only storage be paid for. Which I understand storage, lots of MMOs do that. Anything else would be p2w so yeah I agree with you
---
I just like the idea of having a flat place to build on. But I have seen some videos showing some cool spots that aren‚Äôt flat and I figured I could place some builds that‚Äôll make it look just as cool
---
I haven‚Äôt seen those numbers personally...if that‚Äôs true that sucks, I immediately bought repair kits when they were released bc my lever rifle has always broke insanely fast. I haven‚Äôt noticed a difference personally.
---
That makes sense and I'm sure with the way the area is laid out, it has many possibilities. We still have vault 63 down there too. Maybe they could associate the mole miners with them and they managed to make their own home.
---
South of the Nuka cola plant and the roach house near the road
---
I may as id love to do a vault 94 run and more SBQ events for the goodies
---
I worded it poorly (It is late where I am), but I feel like at this point it is squeezing out an extra 3 months of lifespan that should have been spent by Fallout players on Wastelanders, on essentially nothing. Of course players will still exist and have fun until the DLC drops (I‚Äôm sure I will if my friends continue to play) .
---
Well, if you want max PVE effectiveness, go bloodied, in PA with Emergency Protocols. Hands down the most brutally efficient PVE machine. Very good durability with insane damage, at range. Junkies does just fine as well, and is a less risky, but it‚Äôs less than half the damage output. Junkies you can also afford to get out of the PA, but you lose even more damage not using Stabilized. 
---
Bloodied without PA is a lot more fragile; if you aren‚Äôt a stealth build I‚Äôd stick with Junkies.
---
Basically I can only scrip 3 legendaries a day smh lol
---
To create the coding. Plus they could never let you host a client side server and trust it to be legit. You wouldn't be able to transfer character back and forth.
---
The struggle man, I feel it lol
---
Same issue here on Xb1. Well for me anyway
---
... You already paid for the coding. You bought the game didnt you? The "coding" you are mentioning its already in use by their rented servers. lol
---
&gt;Plus they could never let you host a client side server and trust it to be legit. You wouldn't be able to transfer character back and forth.
---
So don't. Whats the problem?
---
Yeah i know what you mean, i guess youtubers will benefit from not being heckled all the time, roleplayers can now get together and play on roleplay only servers, pvpers can have pvp servers where everyone fights, and hopefully we can configure some of the settings to change up the rules a bit
---
There are some great flat areas around the Mire, a lot of which have access to water as well. You may need to have some extra awareness of your roof colliding with the relatively low tree branches  (2-3 stories max) but there are a lot of beautiful places to build.
---
Try the area around Twin Lakes/Investigator's Cabin. I love it there.
---
It‚Äôs open to you as long as you are 18+
---
Been rock hard playing since last November. 
---
I should consult a doctor..
---
Except you know not to make the same mistakes lol
---
Im a fair amount of years over 18  im down for joining
---
Great to listen to while playing Fallout 76.
---
I caught that reference..
---
Because it takes absolutely no effort to release the server files they are already using so people can host it themselves, but that way, they can't milk the fanbase out of server money and mod money.
---
Definitely. But it is what it is and I'm ok with that. At the very least they're cheap. They're not $20 per 6 Repair Kits or other gibberish.
---
It wouldn't be the same code and the fact that you think it would shows you dont know what you're asking
---
Thanks man, I‚Äôll definitely check it out
---
Ditto
---
Sure thing. It'll be 1400 atoms for each new weapon and 1600 for armor though
---
It's all right. I wouldn't exactly call it "end-all god roll" but still congrats.
---
"I'll never leave you" said since past romantic relationship partners. 
---
People change their mind over time.
---
Lol, are you serious? Im sure the minor tweaks it would (if any) need would bankrupt bethesda.
---
Even if it needed tweaks, which i doubt, you know some basement dweller modder would have that shit sorted out by tomorrow.
---
Programmer here.
---
That's my spot stay away!
---
Not really ballsy considering the utilities are the most popular microtransactions, were basically asking for more.
---
No worries, I live at the tic shack
---
Food used to spoil during fast travelling,  they patched this a while back. 
---
Your claim has no merit.
---
Remember the stink when fo4 released paid mods. Well Bethesda just found a way to indirectly release paid mods. They can use the "The mods aren't being charged for though" excuse and still monetize modding.
---
I don‚Äôt even collect from the bin üòÇ
---
I was able to put all of the other mods on other armor pieces, but the head mods aren‚Äôt working.
---
Sick of it too
---
If you are ever in danger during this event over lvl 50, you kinda suck. People get a kick out of screwing over others, no other explanation. One hit guys in the tunnels, are not "protecting themselves"
---
Sure why not: Xbox: Paladin Bailey
---
Or it should be random so it‚Äôs different everytime
---
Intelligence in FO76 does not grant extra experience gain. In Fallout 4 that is true though. 
---
The Charisma bonus for better rewards is actually extra xp and the amount of a certain kind of base items from rewards like Purified Water or stims. When it actually comes to rare drops from events,  it's just unmodified RNG.
---
Datamine comparisons show otherwise, your claim has no merit
---
Same on PC....
---
Luck determines the condition of gear when found as drops and how fast your critical meter fills up.
---
This is a company that made a statement, not your life experiences
---
Present your data.
---
1 month after this patch and I don't see a difference in how the games Stability has changed... On top of that the same bugs still happen but even more than before this patch.
---
Really? I think our ideas of danger are different lol. Everything is perception my friend, someone coming close to shooting me is danger and if my stealth commando is in danger that means my stealth is blown and bullets are coming my way. Also during certain parts of events stealth is not allowed, like when the uranium legendary pops in and during the events at meatweek, i think also during parts of one violent night. So yes when im in danger all is fair game lol.
---
Yeah, I have a TS 50% limb damage one sitting around. IGN Tazier, I'm on for a little bit right now fucking around, otherwise I can probably get on sometime tomorrow
---
You're an idiot. They aren't free at all. I had to pay $50 to keep a ARK server up for about a year. So take your false reply and shove it up your ass.
---
I wish they'd go back to the original map instead of this newer one.
---
&gt;It'll be hard when the ammo converter comes out
---
It's like you're dancing around the central issue here - Bethesda is exploiting people's psychology for profit.
---
That's nothing new. A lot of business do it too but just because a lot do it, still doesn't make it right.
---
Worse still when Bethesda originally committed to staying on the "right side of the line" (quote from Pete Hines) and they chose to step over to the wrong side of the line for the very reason they stated in the ItV - money. It wasn't primarily for the benefit of the players or responding to player feedback but for revenue.
---
It's an inexcusable action, irrespective of whether or not they're profiting from it. That's what a good number of people are up in arms about. They broke that promise for no other reason than they want the money. Bear in mind that Bethesda is a multi-billion dollar company. They're hardly begging for money.
---
&gt;If we don't want them to make more of these products, everyone needs to stand by their word and not buy them.
---
It shouldn't be on us to not buy. It should be on Bethesda to stay on the right side of the line.
---
That kind of statement is like blaming the victim. It's not on casinos for creating problem gambling; the gamblers should just stop gambling. It's not on companies that use child labour and exploit their workforce; it's on the consumer to be savvy enough about the issue to be aware of it and then not buy those products.
---
Is it starting to ring hollow to you yet?
---
With decent gear you can stand still for 60 seconds with 5 mole miners on you and maybe need 1 stimpak. Justify away, but if you can one shot a legendary, level 40 mole miners are a joke.
---
This game kinda encourages server hopping...I wonder if private servers will be a hard counter to that.
---
Seriously how many improved repair kits do you have from ISS/SBQ?
---
Workshops get attacked though... so they wont be producing anything if u go afk and they get attacked by a scorchbeast or something
---
"Programmer here". Cool story bro. I'm an IT myself and know enough about code and networking to tell you the way connections are handled between server to client or peer to peer are very different. 
---
Bethesda doesn't owe you this service. You're not entitled to it and it was never promised in the 1st place. Buy it or dont. It wouldn't benefit Bethesda in any way to spend the money to implement free peer to peer connections. I think you're so lost in the land of "I should get everything I want for free" that you forget Bethesda is a company. While the customers enjoyment does seem to matter to them at the end of the day they are a business and have to make wise economic decisions in order to fund future content AND make a profit.
---
It's basically turned into having to change your entire build every week because Gearbox decided that having fun wasn't a goal for BL3
---
I didn't even get it (with earned atoms) for the functionality, I got it just because I wanted a bobot bumbling around. I'm sure other people did too for the same reason, so I don't think they can draw any confident conclusion from that data.
---
Ok, hope you find lasting happiness.
---
why would you subject yourself to this
---
Seriously. I love this game, and tried to remain proud of the $60 I dumped into it just to play in the beta. But seeing this company try and nickle and dime me for basic utilities or features past Fallouts had is so damn annoying.
---
Wouldn't matter if you know what you're doing.
---
Yes, No, maybe.
---
"Hey guys, we know an online, multiplayer Fallout with no human NPCs is a game nobody asked for, but don't worry - all of our microtransactions will be cosmetic only!"
---
"People are defending the repair kits? ALL SYSTEMS GO!"
---
but really...what the fuck do you think people are winning? ANYONE can complete the game, and its gotten so care bear now that there is no negative side to dying in pvp or anywhere else for that matter. Its not like you are playing a competitive game for cash prizes or something. this stuff is more, pay to play however the fuck i enjoy playing. Nothing in the shop gives a competitive edge, because there IS no competition.
---
I live at that house!
---
I would imagine doing what you've requested could push back Wastelanders further. 
---
If given the choice, would you: 
---
A. want them to do a serious balance pass (of which I'm sure they'd need to do at least a few iterations) and delay wastelanders a couple of months further into Q2 2020
---
B. Live with what we have and get Wastelanders at Q1 2020 as per current timetable?
---
My Minigun does the same as well. I managed to kill the Queen in around 3-4 minutes because of the Adrenaline Perk and that my Minigun is Bloodied as well... I've literally falling in love with it.
---
Solid idea.
---
Sent a friend request
---
Unyielding is like second only to bloodied in consideration for a balance pass. It's broken af.
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one that hates that title screen change...i miss the original music!!!
---
Definetly not gonna totally disagree, mole miners are a joke lol, and fry much bigger fish. Im not one to compleltly sit still and dont need a stimpack in even the sbq fights. I never said i dont give anyone a chance that people need to basically stop complaining about people who do. I honestly barely play uranium because the event is hit or miss anyways...i use it for a quick steel fix and the bullets most the time because everyones focused on the bait and switch legendaries. But as the original said, its timed and the bar needs to be filled for a better chance for the bigger prize...is that justification enough for ya??
---
And people forget you can play more than 1 game.
---
But I guess it's not allowed.
---
It's a Dev Room item i think, and getting caught with any Dev Room only item will likely earn you a ban.
---
Plus it's lore breaking.
---
Something like milestones in the game
---
Me too
---
I've been wondering about this too. Would be a horrible dropping of the ball moment if they fail to imo.
---
At least outerworlds is going to come out on time. I'm not even buying it but Bethesda really fucked up. All the players they might have kept with wastelanders are gonna be long gone because of outerworlds and a couple of other upcoming 2020 releases.
---
Yeah, i saw it. Can‚Äôt accept it. Good to see the friends list bugs still exist! Try Tazier2
---
If we‚Äôre asking, let‚Äôs get what we really want... more music from Inon Zur !
---
His music for the game has been top notch and a reason to linger in the menus.  
---
The title screens are an opportunity for Inon to give us more. 
---
And I like the option to return to the original music, since it is both awesome and part of the Fallout 76 identity.
---
So basically more from Inon, please.
---
That was the first Fixer she gave me too! Also has faster reload... it's monstrous!
---
Being timed and wanting the best outcome means protecting the collectors, not spawn camping the legendary while it gets destroyed.
---
&gt; Bugthesda
---
I bet you got a little buzz typing that yoo didn't you?
---
That is very true I am nt arguing with that at all, like I said I have quit playing myself but I hate how everyone thinks its next fallout game I was trying to make that clear, but I am sure the way things r bethesda is gonna really get hurt in the upcoming months.
---
Yeah buddy, no one builds non customizable server side software tho.
---
&gt;You're not entitled to it and it was never promised in the 1st place.
---
Check the E3 presentation.
---
&gt; It wouldn't benefit Bethesda in any way to spend the money to implement free peer to peer connections. 
---
Im not talking about P2P connection buddy. Its client-server, exactly how it is currently.
---
&gt;"I should get everything I want for free"
---
When did I said that? I said it would take no effort. I even said that guaranteed they won't release server side software because that way they cant milk the fanbase for it, or the paid mods you're going to have.
---
You know there are a ton of games that  provide the server files along with the game right?
---
Not only that, but I bet you more people would be willing to pay for that than server rentals.
---
&gt;I'm an IT myself and know enough about code and networking to tell you
---
You shouldn't talk about things you don't fully understand or know about.
---
&gt;While the customers enjoyment does seem to matter to them at the end of the day 
---
Nice joke.
---
How about making money by creating a quality product?
---
You tell the other people that lol, i fix the collectors while im killing
---
Most Bethesda enthusiasts like to really get into the one game for a while. Tons of people got immersed and lohged hundreds and even thousands if hours into the previous titles like skyrim, oblivion, fallout 3, fallout NV (Obsidion Title) and hats because the games offered that much to the player. Of course long time fans are disappointed that the latest release (FO76) only has maybe around 30 hours of actual content other than legendary gambling.
---
There is always a choice unless u playing BioShock lol.
---
Just blew 1500 on three characters, 30 pieces of complete trash. Half of them were bashing, a third was Suppressors, three broadsiders, four tommy guns, zero explosive bullets. They really nerfed purveyor to worthless shit grade for this discount.
---
Internet points, mostly
---
Excellent!  Welcome!
---
I agree with this I played fallout 4 religiously I was really sad when I played fo76 lol but I am hoping that nt in the near future but in the far feature the game be good.
---
I miss the OG load music so damn much!
---
I get all of that. I know it's a bad practice, I condone it in no way. But with where games have gone now, I don't know what's going to turn us back. Maybe cyberpunk is going to set an example, since they stated that there are ZERO microtransactions in it. And maybe MW will change it somewhat even more, since they made a statement about not adding in loot boxes because the community was vocal about it, and making it so guns were all easily to be earned (we will have to wait and see if it is true but so far, they have been straight with the community and taken alot out, apparently) I'm not trying to point the blame directly at us, and I'm not trying to make Bethesda seem right for these decisions. But for the inside the vault, they directly mentioned how we seem to like these items. Im fully against them, it isn't what they said in the beginning and yes, they are getting very greedy. They really shouldn't be basing this off numbers, also, and honestly this outrage right here is what they are HOPEFULLY going to listen to. The community is already upset as is, this is more of a slap to the wound. 
---
Then there's the other hand. As I said, even people who are against this content, have the content anyways. Be it, just to have it, or because it's something they felt they did NEED for themselves. And that's where this ammo converter and food processor (?) Is going to come into play and boost numbers higher than with the previous items. They know that we need something to do with our ammo, and they are going to add this, and everyone's going to end up getting it. All I was saying was that even the people who are against this stuff, shouldn't be buying it also. I always hear on the mic and on the sub people just talking about hating all this, but they buy into it as well. And what I think the main way (besides this sub) is to just..not spend atoms on things like that. We need something organized to present to them, instead of random posts here and there. People keep asking for more things, and they keep getting ideas to profit from those ideas. I'm with you, fully, but I think both sides are wrong. Bethesda more than we are, but we are all feeding into it. Addicts to microtransactions or not.
---
Outer Worlds will launch on XBox Gamepass so it has that going for it as well.  Already have it downloaded and waiting on 25th.  Won‚Äôt stop me from playing some FO76, but Borderlands 3 didn‚Äôt either.
---
How did u like Borderlands 3?
---
Not really, games like ARK don't make you pay for private servers and they do just fine. Everyone's trying to defend the fact that we have to pay for servers not realizing that they're just milking us for money. Personally, I'm really just waiting for this to blow up in their face, I've defended Bethesda during this entire mess of a game but after today's ITV I'm not going to defend them and I find myself on the side of seeing what they're doing wrong and I'm probably done with the game until they figure out what they want to do.   
---
Go ahead and give me negative internet points now. üòÄ
---
It's the evolution of "you can't compare this game to an MMO" bullshit.
---
To be fair you are shooting bullets made in some dudes shed out of gunpowder cooked from old money and snallygaster stomach acid so I‚Äôd say they probably perform a little worse than modern rounds.
---
Well, they explains it alittle more. And I can understand that point now as well. And yet, on the other hand, them buying it is what Bethesda is looking at and trying to justify for. But the blame is completely Bethesda, and I can agree with you partly for the reason of decorations. The collectrons were cool to stumble on at first, now I'm just heading the same lines over and over again
---
Also, jesus. 100 friends? I have like. 10, tops. Most are randoms, some are people I actually play with
---
Expansions ok especially if the expansion crosses a state line but keeps gameplay from original. However, subscription fees would exclude some of the worlds players especially those living on low income. A player can save up for an expansion but monthly fees would not fit into the budget. As for myself I am one of those that could not justify a monthly subscription, the fallout series and the Tamriel series have both helped me get through the hardest times in my life including the death of my mother, and my wife‚Äôs illness,  by allowing me to wander aimlessly though the streets and scrub to drop any bad guy that crosses my path from Dragons in Skyrim to Scorch Beast in in FO 76.
---
Rather than subscription, Bethesda should offer advertising or sponsorship as long as it fits into the current format of the game. For example a well know soft drink company could sponsor Nuka Cola or a major canning company sponsor Mama Dolce, even old billboards could offer advertising. Anything to bring the cost of production down so more people can enjoy the family that is FO76.
---
Just a thought.
---
**You're not the boss of me now!**
---
Of course, different ways like, "Kill a glowing Mothman while in a group," or , "Take a photo of a player using atom shop power armor paint while engaged in PvP." You know, those, "fun," ways to earn atoms that everyone enjoys. 
---
Lets be real, its still rather easy to earn atoms and buy stuff from the shop for free. When people have no incentive to buy because they can grind for free atoms, they're not making money. During the raider waster shop month I earned 2300 atoms because the challenges were so simple (collect wood, kill mirelurks, etc). Even the challenges right now aren't too bad, so I'll be able to earn at least 1200 for the Freestates outfit and shotgun skin. The only time I ever had to drop $10 was for the return of the blackbird power armor skin, back when challenges were all centered around the camera and how ridiculous they were. They have the data, they're keeping track of all this. They'll look for any avenue to get that $5 out of your wallet. They've already been creeping by with their Utility sales, and it'll only get worse.
---
And you believe it will be bug free? How many patches have we seen delayed now for these same reasons? 10 out of 14? How many were bug free?
---
April 4, 2014 was when ESO was released, and then One Tamriel came out Oct 5 2016. So basically a year and a half. I remember playing at first. It was alright. I came back for one Tamriel and it was a whole new experience. Plus it somehow have the first 2 dlcs free so that was exciting as well. If I had a better build, I'd play that more. Plus, switching games is horrible for me. I get so confused. I want to go back though, some day. Atleast to finish summerset
---
Pretty sure Outer Worlds will release with more content than 76 did, multiplayer or not tbh.
---
How many delayed patches resulted in bug free patches so far again? Lies$
---
So you wanted them to release something broken? Like they did with this game?
---
You on PC/ getting rid of that LMG?
---
Always has been, the negativity was overblown for YouTube views and reddit karma
---
It's like the Simpsons treehouse of horror with the guy and the frozen yogurt. Wastelanders delayed...awww but we have private servers next week...yay! but the Atomic Shop and challenges are getting revamped... :( but Patch 14 is next week ... :) ?
---
[I love it when a reference come together.](http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/hS58Kb2OOCMPS/giphy.gif)
---
I'm probably done for now, there's nothing to keep me going until wastelanders drop and it just seems like they don't care honestly. I'll probably check it out when wastelanders eventually releases unless it's delayed again. I've been defending this game since release but really I can't anymore lmao, they're not showing a reason to be defended anymore.
---
I bought a tricentenial edition but how many people really paid full price this game was $30 sixty days after release remember.....
---
&gt; it just seems like they don't care honestly.
---
I get that same feeling, it seems like this delay is essentially cutting the game off so It can slowly die or content-starvation. Next March might as well be the year 2452 in internet time, no one will care.
---
One of my favorite shows of all time and that scene was easily one of the best.
---
Ive played all of the games for multiple playthroughs and i never saw it untill fo76.
---
Yea but are there quest givers yet? Or dialogue options? Fo4 was so appealing to me but my save was deleted and there‚Äôs no way I was going to restart. I‚Äôd like to just play 76 because it‚Äôll be completely new to me but finding audio tapes and doing shitty side missions really killed it for me. Is it still like that? Everything seemed very pointless in 76. I don‚Äôt even know what the dlcs are besides one of them being a battle Royale. Lame as fuck
---
I will always love 'Fernando' thanks to that ep.
---
There is and has always been main quests, there are no NPCs to interact with or kill unless you count robots as NPCs. In my honest opinion if you're planning on playing for the long haul, no it's not worth it. I regrettably have 600+ hours in and content is as dry as a desert. If you want to play just to experience the story then sure it'd be worth to pick up. But as of now I can't recommend this game to someone.
---
Damn...bet haha
---
That‚Äôs pretty much what I was looking for. Seems like the took the spine of fo4 removed it and added a bunch of pvp filler and micro transactions on top of a shitty quickly built world. I just want to play fallout so bad but there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm restarting 4 after my files corrupted. Put way too many hours into one save for that
---
Dense armor+fireproof is completely explosion proof, unless it got patched
---
If you don't mind Forest region, there's a secret spot you can build in the maple Grove across from the creamery. Nice view of the bridge there too, and it's pretty good for building on
---
Thank you!
---
It sucks because I had such high expectations for this game and was super excited. Every time they take a step forward they do something that sends them a few steps back, I just can't see myself spending even more hours upon hours on this game anymore unless they really buckle down and get shit fixed. I now see what all the hate around this game was for sadly.
---
And possibly instead of an LED digital clock, make it a flip clock like Watoga.
---
Dialogue and NPC's are comimg in the next major update. And don't diss the Nuclear Winter until you try it, for a battle royale it's pretty fun.
---
There is and always has been a main quest. There is and always has been NPCs, just no human NPCs.
---
I mean fallout has always had some shit bet code I couldn‚Äôt imagine shooting players in real time that‚Äôs why I figured it‚Äôs trash. Plus all the reviews saying it‚Äôs boring and on top of th fact that fallout is mainly a quest driven pve game. Just doesn‚Äôt seem worth it at all
---
If you just want a simple Fallout experience I say pick it up, but if you're looking to stay entertained after you've finished the main quest and the "DLC" I wouldn't waste your money. With today's inside the vault they really spit in everyone's face so I don't see many people staying for long sadly lmao.
---
Na thats pre cap damage. So ts fatman does 3600 roughly. 90% is the hidden cap on damage resistance. So 360 is what lands on fireproof dense.
---
With the 110 thats a problem but with TS acting like 2 actual shots its always 220 damage no matter what they got.
---
I‚Äôd say definitely, since launch there is plenty of content to hold you over until the launch of Wastelanders. If your still skeptical, then maybe wait till the holiday season when the game is most likely to go on sale again.
---
It's all in the perks. Max rifleman and or commando, sneak, covert operative, bloody mess perks cards. Vats crit sneak build is the way to go.
---
Sorry don't know what's going on with your game.  Maybe try another character (don't delete this one) just to see if it happens again or if it's just a bug with the first character?
---
I highly suggest you make a fresh post with this issue in the subreddit so you get more/better responses to your problem.  It might not be as visible posting this issue in someone elses post regarding a different topic.
---
It's definitely doable; the player would basically be running the same thing Bethesda does
---
Really, u log off and ur workshop gets attacked by scorched and scorchbeast, they gonna destroy everything no? Even if u have ton of turrets
---
Yep. Annoying.  PS4.
---
All of this has the bethesda voice, but the script was written by zenimax.  Fuck that.
---
I wonder how many of the sales that made the utility items the best selling category were made with Challenge atoms.
---
He's on Xbox. At least, that's where his screenshot was stored so I'm making an informed guess.
---
There's Vendor CAMPs everywhere lol
---
Yes, I expected that too. But I'm more indicating you need to pay to mod.
---
Was also expecting the ability to have local servers too.
---
Lure weed has been in the game since launch. It's just hard to come by.
---
As for the leaver action rifle. I thought that was there ammo type. I've got 2 in my stash that use .45 ammo. Can't remember if I had to mod them or not.
---
Lure weed has been in the game since the beginning. You can find some growing wild in the Mire too. Lever action rifles were also there from the beginning; I remember there used to be a glitch associated with (reloading?) them. .45 seems to be the default ammo for them.
---
Thanks, man. We think you're pretty awesome, too.
---
Xbox here, not sure what platform you're on; but I get 'world full' 2-3 out of 10 times I try to join a friend.  The servers are far from empty.  Could be the time of the day you play, platform or maybe even your NAT settings if you're seeing empty servers. 
---
As for legendary weapons/armor selling; I sold 15k worth in 3 hours today after cashing in scrip.  
---
Make a mule; really the only way to manage stash space if you have a large collection.
---
Lure weed is normal and has been in game the whole time. I can't recall what my Lever uses, but if you're asking if Lever guns are new, they aren't. 
---
The tokens are for the Vault 94 raid gear.
---
Nah, those have both been in the game for a long time.
---
So that's where Plan: Plasma Grenade is hiding
---
Hurray. I'm over encumbered on 5 characters for the next 5 days.  Wtf bethesda.  Loft the script limit ffs
---
Whitesprings, Top of the World, and the road between the lighthouse and Morgantown all seem to be well populated neighborhoods whenever I log in.
---
Chuck it back in the scrip machine or sell it for about 500c that‚Äôs it‚Äôs worth. If you have nothing better than use it until you get something better, which shouldn‚Äôt take long.
---
That's true. I know I'll be playing. Looks like a lot of fun.
---
On PC sadly
---
Sadly i won't be playing anymore. Rdr2 pc in a couple weeks then the last of us 2 and cyberpunk in Q1. Also doom. This was the last attempt for me....and it sucks.
---
Since I queen too much got too many repair kits so I just usually use those haha
---
Food and water is so abundant that it isn‚Äôt a challenge. It is just a burden. On my level 76 character I have so much food and water it takes up half of my pack. It is annoying to have to drink something every ten minutes
---
Sometimes I still say I got a wooden leg when I get a crappy legendary, even though they fixed wood armor on the loot tables ages ago.
---
wow! Awesome! Only 6 tries too.  I found if you get something awesome, most likely you'll get a few other things that are great as well.  Not sure how to approach the purveyor for this one.. Blow all1000 scrip in one crack and see what happens, or do a couple and see what happens.  If you get the usual medics harpoon or broadsider jump servers and try again?  Not sure..
---
&gt; I'd like to see more tough "bosses" maybe a fight against a giant robot that has been awaken from the nuclear activity pounding the wasteland. 
---
When we nuke Whitesprings, we should get some big nasty robot rising up to defend the bunker from communist invasion.
---
Any handmades would be nice. Think I was little over 500 and as soon as I log in tonight need to figure out what to do over encumbered with crap as always lol.
---
If they actual deliver with wastelanders people will come back. Look at no mans sky, that game was an epic failure and they've rebounded nicely. It took years but they came through. Of course we all know bethesdea isnt going to listen to us and work hard like hello did. Its a year later and the same issues exist.
---
I just put ammo/guns I don't use, duplicate Bobbleheads and magazines for the collectors out there, and some Addictol, and I still got no customers. (TBH I'm not online very often but still)
---
Even if that is the case I would much rather that, imagine being new to the game after buying it for 60$ or so and wanting to play alone or with some friends without other people and having to pay 10-30$ just for a server. Seeing how their atomic shop prices are I wouldn't be surprised if that's how they'll price the server.
---
Well, the Fixer is essentially a four star legendary, so I‚Äôm on board with needing the plan for that gun. It‚Äôs the best battle rifle in the game for a variety of reasons, and I was pleasantly surprised they added it to the list.
---
Bear arm and Sheepsquatch weapons don‚Äôt make a lot of sense though.
---
People can put whatever the hell they want in their vendor. It's not only used by elitists
---
This is why we have a loyalty oath.
---
I have a TSE + agility hunting rifle/sniper level drum role... ONE, it's super op for fresh characters.
---
I played like mad until the update that broke the power armor came out and they didn't fix it. I stopped playing. My friend deleted the game. I've been back occasionally, but I have little motivation to play since I have no team and the bugs and glitches are overwhelming. I've considered going back just to collect lore but if no one gives a shit, why bother?
---
Damn, they kinda deserved it tho
---
&gt;Basically a listen server has to run both the client graphic interface as well as the network simulation portion of the game. A dedicated server doesn't render any interface, its all raw code which saves a ton on resources.
---
Thats bullshit, your local host only renders what you the host sees, like in the same singleplayer instance. If other players join the load gets just increased because the range of vision and actions in the game itself is increased, so yeah it will be more ressource intensive than SP but only if more people than yourself are inside, otherwise you wont really notice the difference.
---
The rest of your post is at best speculation, which i disagree with.
---
No problem- when you learn the plan the ammo also becomes craftable. What system are you on
---
If they are able to create paid private servers, a loca host isnt that far off, it might need some tweaks but its not worlds apart, its actually really similar so it should definitely be possible.
---
You play any other MMOs? Imagine if you could spend $2 to randomly reroll items. This is a thing in other games and it has ruined them. There will start to be a gap between low and high tier players that is nearly impossible to close without paid content. That's what we don't want.
---
I'm all for better cash shop items. I want to support the game and the skins don't do it for me.
---
I wouldn't mind more utility items, as long as they don't cross the line and start selling weapons and armor in the Atom shop.
---
Thats pretty cool. I wish more players did stuff like that.
---
Finally some good news. I wonder if they are planning to release wastlanders when cyberpunk 2077 is getting out ?
---
You can change the title screen to what ever you want in the system files. I got the vault boy cartoons from nexus mods
---
I mean the game can only handle one player camp per session, so if i pay, the whole world is mine, so the whole worlds should be able to be buildable by me.
---
I want to setup camps and forts and whatnots everywhere, if that isnt in, why even bother paying for a private server subscription?
---
If its literally just to shut out other people, but gain nothing else, its 100% waste of money.
---
Even like this its 100% a waste of money since local hosts should be an option too and they should be free.
---
I just want to play Fallout like it was meant to be. Alone or just with a friend or two at most, not some randoms running around and ruining the game and atmosphere.
---
Doing the lords work for many players. Dont listen to this ass hat! On my 3rd char a pistol guy and man do i need to find vendors who sell that next upgrade 2 lvls before i get there.
---
Also if you got spare bobbles or magazines ill pick those up for my main. Many players don't use consumable but i do. I'll take that bobble suppository before a queen fight or a hard area.
---
We love you man dont change.
---
You sound a lot like the guy who destroyed my camp because I didn't have a weapon higher than level 10. My camp was in the forest, for close access to up to level ten players, stocked with weapons ammo and other things that are needed around that level. Plus some extra low priced legendary weapons for level 10.
---
Really great summary of the issues here. The thing that really gets me is that half of the items in the shop are just dumb and they sell for 3 or 4 dollars at a minimum. Much of it should just be added as rewards for questions or as new plans available for purchase. The Atomic Shop should be for the really amazing stuff that is very high quality. When you buy a power armor skin for 10 dollars and it doesn't even include a skin for the damn jet pack, I mean WTF. That is half the price of what they were selling expansions for a few years ago. They should be premium items with attention to detail and quality. Couldn't agree more that their mismanagement of the chosen business model is responsible for their now reliance on creating "utility" items to keep the game going.
---
Lol thanks for the chuckle been working 12 hrs night and needed it, a tip of the hat to u good sir
---
No. The only thing that can help you is luck. Better max condition bars on all your rolls.
---
Nothing will help you get more desired effects.
---
Its not about itellectual property... why do you even threw that in out of the blue?
---
Other games feature both because they know, some people want private worlds with passwords, mods and whatnots, some dont care and just play the "vanilla" official worlds and other just want to play alone and build, explore or play with a friend or two.
---
All of that are: Official Servers, Private Servers and Local Hosts. Of those three one is generally a B2P, a monthly subscription at a server host farm like Nitrado and the other is free.
---
That is how its done for the majority of games of that genre and even many others that offer official/private servers, its is in 90% of the time coupled with loca hosting and that should be done here too.
---
People are allowed to be angry and to criticizes for their decisions, especially if its generally done in a more conumer friendly way than what they plan.
---
The worst part is that it runs at 10 fps. Makes my head hurt.
---
lol
---
Didn't say it was going to be bug free just less buggy, were still playing a Bethesda game using its aging creation engine, it's never going to be bug free lol
---
On Xbox here pal

I‚Äôm CAMPd by a cliff close enough that sometimes I fall as well when I FT in (or inside the cliff wall outright). Who knows what happens to others. I‚Äôve gone so far as to place a guard post hanging off the cliff in that spot. Looks kinda wonky but it stops falls, at least for me.
---
Xbox unfortunately
---
My votes definitely in the Mire, just be careful around high level spawn points.
---
Yooo mr sloth what platform are you on? And can you make me a shield raider outfit thing, I want the combat harness one! :)
---
yes, exactly. it's not rocket science. reminds me of EA calling loot boxes "surprise mechanics" in order to get around loot boxes laws.
---
they're shamelessly lying to our faces and people eat it up. it's insane.
---
Outer World is such a joke quality wise, just look at the animations in the trailers ... as if they reused the shitty handcrafted animations from new vegas. Its 2019 for christ sake, even Beth uses a mix of handcrafted and mocap animations since Skyrim!

Got it my next try right after

aint that a kick in the head?
---
Throw on a bit of luck if you need to get crits. Cirt savy plays very well with the last perk and if anyone wants to pvp your ready with ads.
---
$80 every two months doesn't strike me as a bargan imo. It skews quest designs into daily "let's see how we can drive our players into atomic shop" not what's actually fun/good game design. This is honestly the biggest turn-off for me and the reason I spent like 50 hours in F76 and typically aim for ~500 hours in all other Bethesda games.
---
I nuke towns for glowing ones to farm glowing mass, high rad fluids, hardened mass.

I nuke fissure site for the queen obviously and for flora to combine with the ingrodents above to make serums.
---
200 atoms to upgrade legendary items by 1 star.
---
100 atoms to re roll item per star.
---
What would you say to that?
---
&gt;Listen servers run in the same¬†process as a game client. They otherwise function like dedicated servers, but typically have the disadvantage of having to communicate with remote players over the residential internet connection of the hosting player. Performance is also reduced by the simple fact that the machine running the server is also generating an output image.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_server#Listen_server
---
Even if you launch a headless dedicated server locally on your PC and run the game separately, you're still using an immense amount of resources. If you have a 12-16 thread CPU, 32 GB+ of ram, and a beast motherboard and gfx card, you can probably get pretty stable performance for 3+ friends but its reliant on your network upload speed as well. 
---
Also data center servers have high grade hardware such as [ECC ram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory) and are incredible more stable to host on vs home PCs.
---
The biggest challenge for these large open world mp games to be hosted locally is that you need to design your game around lower end consoles and PCs bc that's a large portion of your market else you'll get feedback like [this](https://survivetheark.com/index.php?/forums/topic/405438-original-xbox-one-performance-boost/).
---
I'm on the PS4...  I'm in for 1 copy of the plan...  I can also trade you some flourescent flux...
---
PS4 and sure

You should only spend scrip on a server where you've already gotten decent stuff.
---
There are a couple great spots in the Bog. Go to Bog Town, find the road that leads to the Ranger Office and follow it a short distance to the west, you'll come across an island in between two river arms. It's oval shaped, slightly less wide than the CAMP circle, so good for a house and water purifiers down in the river. It's got a silver vein on the southern part as well.
---
Plus it's kind of a secret tip, I've never seen anyone except myself set up camp there.
---
I wish I could destroy your camp. No one needs level 15 weapons or armour. If you do, you are playing the game wrong. For the longest time in this game, there was no player vendors. You figured it out on your own....
---
If they want to waste people‚Äôs time and not get mods and scrap.......smart idea.

Youre gonna want to ditch all that stuff asap.  Somebody was duping items.
---
Yeah I work in the industry and I understand how to make money

Ok, great. Thank you, work has been busy so I'll take a peek at this on the weekend

I live up there and suggest anyone that goes up there wear PA if you're not prepared for a fall.
---
People used to buy game sharks and Magazines were sold for the cheat codes they printed. The majority of people don't really agree with buying non cosmetic items ( pay to win even without direct competition in game is a sucky narrative for a game vs good mechanics and core) pay lock gate keeping with micro transactions is also frowned upon (in game toll booths) 
---
Yes people will pay money for thing in a game. But...people prefer when purchasing is based on good faith and not manipulation.    Ie: You buy a skin because of it's quality and don't buy fast shoes because the game developer half way through the year implements molasses shoes on everyone and you all are now super slow in game,  Creating a problem and selling a fix is bad faith. One could say Bethesda my be creating artificial need and also one may say 5¬£ for a skin is absurd. 50¬¢ is likely more reasonable for most skins but they set precedence to gouge way back with horse armour being 3¬£ in Scrolls. 
---
If you post production think of something good for the game and add it in the atom shop it should be reasonably priced and should not have been an engineered need. It should also be of a certain quality for it's price point is all I'm saying. Allowing people to collect free atoms is community good will and something all companies should do. They are still going to have purchases on top of any good will given.
---
So by no one you mean the people level ten and under that I was selling to? Yeah you're just an r/choosingbegger if I ever met one. What you fail to realize is that 
---
1) i had stupid low prices for said beginner players
---
2) every piece of each weapon and armor had the best modded pieces so said beginner players have a little of an edge
---
3) You missed the part where I was also selling legendary weapons specifically for their level. Also with the best parts available. 
---
4) You obvious know nothing about capitalist demographics so sit down and take five there turbo, you're only reaffirming that you're a pretty griefer
---
I feared this would happen. The whole thing looks very bad. They are basically putting the game in maintenance mode until they figure out a better way to make money. We will get a Halloween event and maybe something for Christmas and that is all for this year. Can‚Äôt say I am interested about any of this. I will keep track of any news about bug fixes but I can‚Äôt find a reason to play the game or spend any money on it.
---
You really don‚Äôt have a clue. Sad.....
---
Bethesda will know better than anyone when the game is going to die. They had their experiment with this game and it's mostly failed.
---
I'd bet they're just waiting to move on and get starfield and tes6 out.
---
He also said every in-game human would be a real human player.
---
They're allowed to change stuff when they see it doesn't work as intended.
---
It's possible. There were things slowly put in before vault 51 opening and before the Sheepsquatch arrived. Those we're all added within the same month as their release though so I wouldn't expect anything soon.

This is not a competitive game. There is no difference between players. We use the pve system for leveling. There is no item in game that offers ANY advantage over another player. All it is, is play style. You can level an alt to max level and build him any way you want in a week. There is no competitive edge in any way with this game. Its actually perfect in that. This is t a hardcore mmo or anything like that. It's just a fun world to play around in. You cant lose anything. All that there is is collecting items that you WANT, not need. Why the hell would anyone care if you can spend easily obtained atoms on a instant level 60 token ot shot like that. It doesnt detract from YOUR game experience. If for example you were able to use atoms to buy a set of legendary power armor like what you can get from vault raids, that still doesn't detract from YOUR experience. It may piss you off that joebob paid for his, but it does not affect you in any way.
---
Shit , I sold the mines . I don‚Äôt understand duping . There was none else there and they all just appeared . I‚Äôll gladly give the caps up , I don‚Äôt want to get banned .

Except they don't have any metrics for all the money they're leaving on the table by doing things half-assed.
---
What many people have requested and I would like to request too is a title screen music volume. I want my game to be on high volume but the title screen is just very loud when I open up the game. The implementation of a title screen volume is needed so we don't have to raise and lower the master volume everytime we don't immediately join a world.

I have a Bloodied SS +1 Int Board called "The Board of Education".

If the item isn't worth $18 then don't... buy it.

Just in time for The Outer Worlds to come out!
---
Well I hope your in the minority, bud. This game has a lot if potential and going that route will tarnish it for sure.
---
Between the legendary drop rate  nerf, changes to events and no additional content I think this game will be on life support till Wastelanders. If they fuck up Wastelanders, like they have with the vault raids, I doubt it will bounce back.

Railways are great for VATS PvP... Until your opponent turns up stealthboy/torso. Good luck hitting with it then.

Flechetted QE harpoon on raid PA will kil most people in two shots. I know, I use one, though to achieve 110 on flechette one would have to use JE/BE exemplar (mine does 30-80 dmg per hit, depending or opponent's armor).

Also JE/BE Laser Rifle with Beam Splitter can possibly achieve that - it melts my PA under two seconds.

Can you open the game .exe file? (C:\\Program Files (x86)\\[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher\\games\\FO76\\Fallout76\\Fallout76.exe)

If yes, I would uninstall the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) Launcher and reinstall it from the Bethesda website.

If it can be full auto then thats how you should play it. Semi auto has it's big bad with lever and black powder.

I can't shake the feeling that BGS really only sees a couple more years for this game.  If that is the case then they will definitely milk as much out of it as they can as quickly as they can.  I'm not one of those people that have been saying the game is "dead" (everytime I play my server is full or nearly full).  But I do believe the success or failure of Wastelanders will determine the future of the game.  If it fails, the player base will drop drastically.  If that happens then the game truly will begin to die.  BGS is well aware of this I'm sure.  Expect many more utility type items in the shop until Wastelanders is released as a "Plan B" to help recoup money if the DLC fails.
---
Okay. I'll switch my handmade rifle over to full auto. It's been a long while since I've last played the game so thanks for the fast reply.
---
Xbox. Doesn't matter though, because of people like OP I closed up shop. I no longer vend in any region, though my original camp was literally a 3 cap fast travel from the overseers camp. In noob country.
---
Had it on pc for months.
---
I meant more that that is how BGS will justify it.  Not saying it's right, just saying that's how it'll be explained.
---
How can you hit with it, though. Without vats it's nigh impossible to land the shots accurately.
---
They want money.
---
It looks very professional, well done! Hopfully it should get you a good grade!

That's awesome. Congrats! I got a anti armor exploding 10mm auto pistol on my first try on my second go around and I just found a quad exploding pipe pistol for 1100 caps at someone's camp. I love this sale.

I rolled for 40 2\* ranged weapons (40 x 25 = 1000). I kept a Furious +10 Aim Dmg 50 Cal (SBQ liked it) and a Furious Explosive Minigun (kind of underperforms), sold 4 rifles with explosive/bloodied/instigating properties and simply dropped the rest in front of the station. 
---
I remember RPGs where you found a sword with 3 gem slots and if you gathered the right gem components, you could have an NPC create a Fire+Acid+Ice sword for you...
---
so the atomic shop contains non-cosmetic items, but do they give players a lot of advantage? kinda like a pay2win?
---
cuz if they gon' add legendary weapons (or something like that) in the atomic shop im gonna be real disappointed in this game
---
this ITV made me want to reverse the .exe in hopes of setting up a local server. knowing Bethesda it's probably just a hackjob stitched together, anyway.
---
or go the hard way and just port everything over to Fo4.

Like all the weapons in 76 they added have very few attachments

This! Been going on for months now

Huge oof here. I can‚Äôt imagine what a delusional world you live in where the games you frequent are No Man‚Äôs Sky, Fallout 76, and retail WoW are considered good to you and you‚Äôd actually feel the need to tell someone those other games aren‚Äôt. 
---
I bet you‚Äôll murder someone one day, psychopath.
---
Plenty of practice.  Against SB Teslas I usually break out a Quad.  Auto-Stim and Born Survivor won't help as much if your lost health can't be quickly replced by spamming stims.  If they don't have radaway on their wheel, they're gonna have a bad time.
---
And it's total hell on bloodied builds.  One or two shots and they're dead from rads alone.
---
Forgive me for saying what did you expect comming to a low level camp? Its not like they are going to have god tier weapons they're low level of course they will have petty equipment.

Last of us 2 really?! Might even put 76 away myself for the first time since release...
---
If we didn't get or earn free atoms in game I'd agree with you
---
It's so bad that they've added survival features as a paid microtransation instead of offering for example a fridge you unlock via a quest and then sell cosmetics for it. The wording of the update above makes me feel sick, it's a shame i had fun with fo76
---
We'll believe it when we see it.
---
That isn't acceptable either but at the very least it's free, fallout 76 a AAA game that costs money neverwinter isn't a AAA game and it doesn't cost money, but as I said before neither game should have any microtransactions that effect gameplay IN ANYWAY even if it's a tiny tiny amount
---
 [https://imgur.com/GexPV64](https://imgur.com/GexPV64)  Here's a map of most of the pump codes for this raid.
---
You had a hand in it too, you brought the set up of the bit to life my friend.
---
Hmmm,
---
Its not an exact comparison but I have both ffr and exp junkies handmades and in my experience they feel roughly the same in the time to kill on a single target but I do note the following:
---
The exp has splash damage so its quite nice at clearing up low health targets without having to he too accurate.
---
At close quarters, you'll need fireproof at potentially a dense armor chest piece to stop you blowing your self up the whole time.
---
The FFR 'feels' like its better against bats, especially when they are in flight. I think this might be because when in flight, you have a very short window when they are in range and at the right angle to get headshots and during the same time period you can land more hits with the ffr than the explosive.
---
The ammo usage is better with the explosive.
---
Personally I carry both with me and swap demolitions for gunsmith as needed. Generally I find I use the explosive one for general use and the ffr for bat's and the mama bat and/or for a hot swap when the exp one breaks mid fight.
---
PS. I run demo expert at rank 4 and it seems fine, you don't loose too much damage so that might be an option.
---
Players logic cry over money they don't have to spend
---
Thanks I'll be doing a raid later today and over the weekend. Join if I'm online and your ready
---
Apparently he's the edgelord madlad supreme and because of his 1800 hours of game time we need to bow down to him. Fuck that shit let him whine, no one here agrees with his arbitrary opinion based on his narcissistic need to he catered to as the only human playing fallout 76.
---
Imagine if they sell perk loadouts in the atomic shop üòÇüòÇ for the low price of 9.99
---
That‚Äôs an awesome write up and answer man, thank you, what about the damage cap? Or is that not a thing anymore? 
---
Because if the damage cap is a thing, that might be a limiter for explosive, no?
---
Not many know that he's from israel (where I live). Composed a lot of video games title songs and won a lot of awards for them.
---
Better idea would be two tiny tweaks to the map would solve this: a) put the players level next to their camp name on the map, b) put the number of legendary items in brackets next to the weapon and armor counts. It wouldn't be 100% perfect but it would be 80-90% better.
---
 I don't mind the new music in 76, it's a little more like the older ones, but FO3 and New Vegas had better music...and content.  I never really got tired of their title screen music. Fallout 3 was the best. It was just so much more ominous, and triumphant, like Fallout should sound. ‚ò† It just made you, someone straight from the vault, want to get out in the terrifying **wastes** and discover the devastation the Great War caused. It made you want to explore the world of nuclear annihilation, like the awesome lone wanderer you are. 
---
I loved New Vegas' as well. It was still kind of ominous, and just you knew you were going to conquer the wasteland, and become an obviously badass courier, yet again. 
---
This may be an unpopular opinion, because a lot of people love Fallout 4... but it's music was too hopeful and happy for a Fallout game imo...( just like most of the game itself) It was just getting you ready to meet Preston, and save any and all settlers in the entire Commonwealth, at ANY, and ALL TIMES. "Forget about your son, ANOTHER settlement needs your help!" C'mon really? (I dont care about saving the wasteland, I want it to stay as savage and harsh as it's **supposed** to be.) This is just my opinion, of course. I LOVE Fallout games. üíï
---
 I know this is just about the title screen and its music, but honestly, I hope they can eventually get their games back to what they were. More than just changing the title screen, and its music...ü§û
---
Anyone still thinking no man's sky is a bad game clearly hasn't followed any news for the past 2 years.
---
I‚Äôll clap for them when they fix the ridiculous number of bugs plaguing this goddamn game.
---
They‚Äôre already selling teleporters for our junk and magical repair kits. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me.
---
Peek loadouts was available as a mod a couple months after release, someone else did their work for them....
---
See this is a reasonable way to approach this, not whine about it and be a general dick like OP
---
U r lucky. All I got was crap armor n guns
---
Either completing Savage Divide events, or trading with other player. 
---
One is rare, the other expensive.
---
We will always see such dounchbags
---
yeah man, because apparently "utility" items have been highly requested lmaoo
---
They need to completely eradicate duping before they  increase armour and weapon levels, otherwise the market will be immediately flooded with new max level god rolls
---
The new thing is darker, and not in an interesting way.
---
Once it's out it won't be long before someone takes the code and mods it so you can play it on your own server instead of paying for their servers. Once that happens all the fun shenanigans will start as ppl start to hack and mod the crap out of it. IP personally looking forward to a mod that changes every schorchbeast to the queen lol.
---
Is duping still around with weapons and armours? Also if duping isn't possible with these anymore. Increasing the max level will render all the duped god rolls second class.
---
10 - 15 bucks for Wild Appalachia? With that amount of content I would at most give 5 bucks, really.
---
Yep its still around, i dont keep up to date on the actual methods, but every patch the dupers test their old haunts to see if anything has been reverted so they can do dupe again
---
And yep i agree, it would make current god rolls less worth, thats why duping needs to be stopped first
---
This post is a little excessive, but I have to admit I've been annoyed a couple times by people selling 20 common outfits for 200 caps each.
---
I still support splitting Armor into 'Armor' and 'Outfits' when viewing camps on the world map.
---
Well good for you and thumbs up for spicing up PvP.  
---
I have a Q limb Gamma and so far managed to kill two guys with it... But I guess it can work with right build and knowing what to do, as does everything.
---
They do, in a way.
---
Bulk Ammo Scrap can be traded 1:1 with Stable Flux, as they're both in the 150-200 caps price range.
---
Your gonna shit a brick when you experience the damage output for yourself
---
If the Automatron isn't in the season pass, I wouldn't have bought it.
---
Back to this game, the questlines are short and simple, the Burrows are nothing but a simple small map update, the new boss fight isn't even comparable to SBQ in terms of scale.
---
Well and I don't think Wild Appalachia includes that much, check this photo:  [https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/wIDGIptP0rBhyIitypnwO/32fccfa369ba99be13ab079b3dd73619/Fallout76\_WARoadmap\_NEW\_FULL.png](https://images.ctfassets.net/rporu91m20dc/wIDGIptP0rBhyIitypnwO/32fccfa369ba99be13ab079b3dd73619/Fallout76_WARoadmap_NEW_FULL.png)
---
I don't think that's the way to go. I mean, a level 50 pipe pistol only has better stats than a level 5, so it's not interesting. They both do the same thing, just a level 50 one takes fewer shots. Though, I personally don't like item levels, instead preferring a more horizontal progression system.
---
Imo the DLCs should be like the ones you get in NV or it isn't really worth it.
---
Yeah alright. Now I'll need to farm for some 5.56 lol. Did Bethesda ever nerf the munitions plant more than once? I was around for the first need but did they ever nerf it again?
---
Trying to act like it‚Äôs an alt account. Bigger oof.
---
This game crashed and burned on takeoff, it never even got off the ground. We‚Äôve all just been sifting thru the ashes for sum semblance of a half decent game, but alas, there were no survivors. But plz buy a fridge for your camp before you leave! Only 10$!
---
Cheers. Hopefully get something useful after recycling it all. Until then its back to all the usual spots and grinding.
---
I think your right, I spent 5 hours server hoping and could not find it in the shops
---
Wow that's awesome! You posted it a little late in the day though everyone is sleeping right now Haha
---
Do you have a spare I can buy? :) I'm on xbox
---
I just wish the images weren't terrible. We usually only get 1 of the item, and then a few of awkward poses, but the pictures are so small you can hardly see them.
---
Let us zoom in on the pictures at the very least, and include some better shots like first person views of weapon skins. Maybe even a 3d view of the model if it's possible
---
Just make a post on the Market subreddit, plenty being traded there :)
---
yes, on PS4 console I used to crash a minimum of once every three hours. Played two hours yesterday without crash so my total playtime without crash is at 8 hours now!!
---
I just moved out of the Mire because I was sick of having to repair my camp every five minutes.
---
I use a furious handmade in a stealth sniper build and I've gotta say it's still pretty damn nice.  I prefer it over a lever action for scorched beasts, queen mirelurks, etc.  Auto builds are equally great so I'd say just do whichever is more fun.  I also came back to the game about a week ago and I'm having a good time.
---
I got like 6 railway rifles in a row, so I got that goin for me, which is nice üòû
---
Sadly I am on PC.
---
I personally cant comprehend spending that much (or any) money on them. But hey, it's your money, you have every right to spend it on whatever the hell you want.
---
Items need to be updated straight into the game, with small quests, or even just a "Find this Plan" objective.  They did a good job doing that with the camera, starting as an easy quest for a semi-useful item, and adding skins in the atom shop if you really want it.  But then they took a MASSIVE step backwards by adding Collectrons and Fridges to the Atom Shop and not the base game.  This is a VERY slipper slope which I fear we're gonna end up going down, no matter what backlash they get.
---
I've bought a silly hat from a vendor before. I'll probably buy one again. Sometimes it's just a hat day, y'know? You should lighten up and try it.
---
Because 60$ is a fucking ridiculous amount of money for a game - and that‚Äôs a steal at USD. I paid over 80$ CAD for a game that, (while I admittedly enjoy), was broken at launch and still has issues a *year* later. Just because ridiculously expensive games have become the norm doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs good or fair.
---
A whole bunch pf people were complaining thier accounts were hacked yesterday... Turns out they all downloaded software to dupe. Only it had a keylogger in it. Lol the irony.
---
Fantastic üòÇ. Maybe they'll learn a lesson
---
I'm really not arguing with you. Im agreeing with most of your points. It would be nice to see a bit more work put into making utility item plans more accessible. Even if its restricted to your own camp, like atom store purchases are already. 
---
I did like how advanced repair kits dropped from in sbq. It should continue to be that way, even if its far easier to get them from the store. I think they should be made avalible in game as well. 
---
I'm guessing, or at least hoping that this rework of the atom store will yield more atoms for everyone. And itd be nice if there was a conversion from cap to atoms, even if its player to player stock market style with a fluid value adjusted by how many people are selling their atoms. 
---
A conversuon somewhere in the ballpark of 
---
15:1 would be acceptable (thats caps to atom)
---
Well I don't really think things like the refrigerator or the collectron was bad for the game, it's convenient and at the same time not over powering, it's not a must have nor something useless. As for the kits, if anyone is stupid enough to buy those then so be it, and again it's not overpowering, just provide a little convenience.
---
Don't just focus picking on someone's words over the fact that the change is good.
---
Technically he was just describing the game as it was lol. And we all knew it was going to be bad.
---
Im on ps4 and yes can not wait til we get it very excited. So tired of going into my perk card swapping and swapping back just to pick a lvl3 lock holy crow.
---
Addressing a minor point:
---
You can rename your power armor frame and regular armor (highlight it in your inventory and select "Inspect", then "Rename". I rename my PA with a \* before and after; "\*PA Ultracite\*" or "\*PA Raider\*", that pops it up to the top of your apparel list. You could rename things alphanumerically to categorize regular armor... "1 Hvy Cmbt L Arm", "2 Lt Lthr R Arm", etc... That helps a ton with organizing.
---
Wow holy crap. They need to stop making bullshit for the atomic shop and nw and fix the actual game. I'm amazed that it's still broken
---
U ever been in pvp and had ur best weapon break or have to survive on spoiled food i have its all about interpretation
---
Play Fallout 4
---
I am thinking they might not allow custom settings for that.
---
I have it modded the same way; it's just that I exclusively run FPV/ADS and solo, which goes well with heavies, but no so much with finicky weapons like gamma. Also that non-insta hitting mechanics, where you must lead the cones in front of running guys... Not good. And it its that 32 ammo magazine in a second or two.   
---
But then again, if it works for you, all the better. Non-PA users must get truly wrecked by it. Even in PA the rad dmg can be felt pretty hard.
---
If you're on pc yes. But then you would not be able to move your characters between public and private.
---
Fallout 76 is a AAA game?
---
Well that is if there is anyone still cares about this game by March 2020.
---
I am kinda sure it will drop in March since they say Q1 2020.
---
True but if you could convert caps to atoms then that's just another way companies will lose out on a chance to get money but it's possible one day that might happen
---
Most of the game is lore breaking tbh
---
The jumping thing is a perk calling frog legs.
---
This is what I'm assuming as well. Guess it might depend on how they price it for example if it's quite cheap for now I'd image we can't control anything.
---
Whaaa? Theres no ditches if you launch the nuke correctly and drag the queen out of the blast zone
---
Intelligence does affect xp. I just shot a ghoul with 13 intelligence(with unyielding armor) it gave me 122xp. 
---
When I took the armor off(1 intelligence lol) and shot the same level and same type of ghoul it gave me 91xp. 
---
I did that 5 times just now, the numbers were always 91 with 1 intelligence, and 122 with 13 intelligence.
---
Idk about the charisma though, theres really no way to test that, some data miners would have to figure that out.
---
Not that i disagree with u but those were terrible examples and have they even said whether ther gonna allow ur characters in there and most similar games to this one have some alternative u can use for servers
---
Not everyone is pay to play hell only a small amount of us players actualy pay any amount of $$$ into the atom shop. and i only see thoes same players buying expansions while 90% of the community complaines.
---
Because sitting at the end of a dock staring at a bobber while blasting Uranium Fever sounds relaxing as fuck. Maybe watch some netflix at another screen while doing it.
---
Also; add in a small chance to fish up treasuremaps (in a bottle) or maybe even an 0,001% chance at a dope rare outfit.
---
Just dont fucking make it another Atom Shop item (fishing chair or whatever). I need some actual stuff to do/look for in game :/
---
I'm leaving after 350h of gameplay. They fucked it up between the delays and the shitty event update.
---
I like it when everyone gets a shot in and then stops thinking there‚Äôs someone left and the legendary just starts wandering around
---
Want clarity? You are gonna get fucking items from the challenges to make you buy Atoms.
---
No, I can't :)
---
Thank you. I was wondering. Im only rank 14 but its taken me probably 100 matches to get here. Im. Not good. Lol so I dont have that perk yet but Im on my way 30 XP at a time!
---
Moose mods mey be avalable for Pc but players on consoles are SOL and dont have that abbility to use anything like that.
---
OMEGALUL I literally switched off my main account to check the inbox for this one
---
Well my rank is even lower, I'd rather play Pubg on my mobile honestly
---
For the record, if one of your 5 addictions is Psycho and you take some, you now have 4 addictions counting towards the effect some you have to be in withdrawal. I keep a Buffout addiction instead as the -5 carry weight isn't that big of a deal and if I take a bufftats I get to carry 20lb more (15 from the drug and 5 from not being in withdrawal). 
---
Run Chem Resistant to use as much as you want without risking addiction to Psycho or Med-X.
---
This sub hears this shit every week.
---
I origonaly came from skyrim no i never played a single fallout game untill fallout76 . yes story wise im lost.com but like fallout 4 skyrim has the creation club. All thoes items were rl $$ you needed to spend to get mods. So why would Bethesda be any diffrent with fallout76.
---
I hope we can get servers from any host, not just Bethesda ... so im just taking one from work for free, hah!
---
How does a fridge give you a robot
---
I‚Äôd also like a ‚Äúpictured with‚Äù caption for anything showing more. I looked at the skull mask with helmet and it showed the character wearing a tee shirt with tire armor shoulder pads but I‚Äôve no idea what that is or where to find it...
---
yeap deciding to add content that was requested for a long time and deciding to hide content behind paywall despite promising not to do so are one the same my man, amazing reasoning!
---
I had 200 scrip aswell i did all my rolls on meelee. 1 3* ferous deathclaw and a 3* ferous golf club everything else was trash. Witch will meet the legendary mechine once it resets. So i can try again.
---
TIL !
---
My point stands regardless
---
Because those are legendary in most cases. Make those in quest non legendary like rest of cryptids, and maybe little weaker to make them comparable and it's fine.
---
Not talking about that.
---
How come you didn't just use a hazmat suit in high rad areas?
---
Nice, I can't even get the plan to drop and have done the event several times.
---
&gt; (although I do have a morbid curiosity to see the shitstorm it would release if they fucked it)
---
I have a hard time imagining a world where there isn't a shitstorm after its released. It's not going to be flawless - nothing ever is - so there will still be some people complaining about it no matter what.
---
They aren‚Äôt adding weapons...
---
Fridge and collectron sold very wel and are 99% cosmetic. Nobody bought them to get any sort of edge lol.
---
I would give you award but im poor
---
Happened to me sometime on ps4 too.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
PSA: there‚Äôs a PC mod to change the music back
---
Same for me last night. It lasted a good eight seconds.
---
Worst thing about GTA p2p server is cheaters
---
If you're on PC, I keep putting a few level 5 and 10 legendaries in my vendor near the junkyard specifically to help out the low-level characters. Unfortunately level 200s keep buying out my stock.
---
No. 
---
I am saying these things don‚Äôt give an edge lol. The fridge for example... storing food in your stash and having to go back to your stash anytime you need to eat is not the most efficient way to play the game lol. People who bought it, bought it because they thought it looked cool, not to get some sort of advantage lol. 
---
I am at zero disadvantage for not using $ to buy atoms, I have earned over 5k atoms in game. I wouldn‚Äôt waste them on repair kits either lol. Junk is everywhere. My stash is overflowing with it. It takes 20 seconds to resist a weapon without one. I spend my atoms on things I think are fun. 
---
Do you even play the game? Lol
---
I go to uranium fever with a 10mm pistol just to tag. When folks show up in full PA and .50cal guns, you know it‚Äôs going to be a battle just to tag.   I just stand and tag as much as I can and wait for the end. What‚Äôs even worse is when they stand right at the spawn points and shoot before they even enter the room. Total dbags.
---
Maybe wait and see before freaking out lol.
---
It's gonna be a spooktober event.
---
There's already a camp with Murgle the cat, North of Welch's train station. My guess is, the purveyor lived here before opening its shop in Berkley.
---
The best weapon I got is a Junkie‚Äôs Death Tambo with swing speed and +strength
---
Yes, because everyone plays console.... /s
---
That would be nice but I highly doubt it. What I would've liked is the option to see the time not only on RADIO tab but on any pip-boy screen.
---
Allegedly
---
Congrats!
---
Indeed
---
Xbox
---
It sounds like something wrong with your connection causing some sort of lag. I didn‚Äôt get any sort of duplicates and actually really lucked out with good stuff ( anti armor handmade, bloodied combat rifle, executioners explosive handmade, etc)
---
I just can‚Äôt see mods being a thing - it would all but kill the Atom Shop and thus their only revenue stream. This can already be seen with Creation Club - a lot of superior quality equivalents can be got for free elsewhere, and don‚Äôt come with the oversights or bigs that the CC stuff does. Bottom line is, a room full of devs putting up a few cosmetics can never compete with the entirety and creativity of the modding community.
---
my bloodied hook does 2k damage w/o adrenaline, vampires does not compare lol
---
They said you will be able to use mods in private servers soon... literally in the inside the vault yesterday.
---
Exactly my feelings man. That gun is fun. Idk why they just can't add the same receivers as the western as a bare minimum. Barrels and grips would be nice too but atleast receivers. 
---
In a perfect world the reload would be cut 25-30% and it's base damage would be 15 or so more than the western. They would still balance out fps wise and give you a reason to choose one or the other. One hand is slow and powerful, the other is faster with a little less damage,options to use optics which are accurate (scope) and reduce the AP cost (reflex).
---
A very good weapon indeed. probably one of the best rolls for general use. Explosive chews through durability. two shots makes the gun too imprecise denying the 20% damage boost. Only better thing you could have gotten would be fire rate. Bloodied is just not something I'd ever use.
---
I have one that ignores 50 % armor, less action points cost and + 50 %  limb damage. With tormentor and full commando I can cripple anything immediately. It's fun.
---
And before we know it, those Lunchboxes will be a thing.
---
I saw that too. Is there a reason for that? I've noticed that the hit is not accurate at all when you swing a melee weapon, but even when you manage to link the hit to a limb, nothing special happens.
---
Yeah, and for big bads clipple first and dps later. All mobs are a fair bit more chill with a missing leg.
---
Stay crouched. Be sneaky. Don‚Äôt run out in the middle of the road without checking surroundings.
---
Plans obtainable by a quest in game, not the atom shop, maybe additional holotapes on the atom shop.
---
Still better than F76 in that regard.
---

10% while aiming has incorrect description and should be "10% all the time you do damage, aimed, VATS, hipfire, doesn't ever display in pip boy"
---
I have a bloodied melee unyielding armored toon I'm having fun with. \~ Lvl 170.  
---
Yesterday I started a new toon going a total different direction. I want it to reach end game and with me being a filthy casual this should give me good fun for the next 4 months... at least.
---
I mean what does it matter IF they put pay to win stuff in the game, it don't mean you have to buy it. Hell these cheaters would prolly be the reason that they would do it anyways (or atleast it will be tjeir excuses).
---
It wasn‚Äôt us that said this game would be ‚Äòsupported forever‚Äô - that expectation was laid by Bethesda (https://hothardware.com/news/fallout-76-interview). If after just 11 months they haven‚Äôt got the manpower to stick to the promises and roadmap they defined and publicised then there are bigger problems than manpower behind the scenes.
---
"Coming soon to an Atom Shop near you!"
---
The only problems with the creation club are that everything is overpriced and the new shit you buy is never added into the level lists except for the handmade shotgun. 
---
Paying popular modders to make official add ons is a great idea as long as they are priced correctly for what they are. 
---
they have slowly ever so painfully slowly been getting better about this but it should never have been a problem at all.
---
I am just sitting here waiting for the ability to play in true SP offline mode. 
---
I know they will never let it happen because then they can't whore out the atom shop but i am still waiting.
---
In my experience you can make it longer in NW with wood armor and no weapons than you can with marine armor and armed to the teeth by hiding and planning your next move. Play the long game and try and get the drop on people rather than engaging ever person you see.
---
I even gave up on checking the Atom Store. My group kept waiting on Enclave themed gear, but instead all we see is re-releases of raider stuff and all.  
---
I mean shit, how hard can it be to add.
---
Thanks a lot. üëçüèª
---
I had SEVEN auto grenade launchers. SEVEN. total of 1600 scrip...
---
I've not played in days because I was waiting for Halloween and then WL but now I'm not sure what todo in game.
---
I don't even know what to say.  Of course it would matter.  It would kill the game.
---
Great idea! Nothing gave me a bigger jump scare in this game than the first time I ran into one of those. 
---
We need to not be able to VATS or kill them until they come out of their shell though. I think it's supposed to give a 0% hit chance, but VATS still lets you know they're there, and also it's bugged so you can one-shot them at 100% accuracy if you fire quickly.
---
The included pictures already don't work!
---
If anyone believed that privat servers were gonna be free is an idiot. I just hope we can get them from any host and not just Bethesda them self.
---
I think the entire weapon and armor level system should just go away completely. 
---
the fallout 4 system worked perfectly fine, you can use any weapon at any level but they will be shit unless you spec into that weapon class and get good mods. 
---
It is incredibly immersion breaking that my fresh vault dweller who is desperate for supplies to survive the horrors of the wasteland can find a shotgun and then for literally no valid reason just say "no i am not prepared for this shotgun i must instead use this shitty pipe pistol but only this one not the other one in my bag that does more damage for some reason even though they look identical.
---
This was a mod for FO4 wasn't it? I vaguely remember it being very finicky so sadly doubt Beth will make it :(
---
Made me wonder what the "focus" was there too. Let's be honest here, the whole raid thing was mostly a mapping thing, not a huge amount of coding went into that shit, however they try to spin it.
---
I left 10 almost full random power armors in a circle at top of the world station 2 days ago. I was doing the repair PA.
---
I mean... unless you are level 15
---
Seeing the same players on occasion sure isn't giving me good vibes.
---
There is a wrong way to play. The people who don‚Äôt realize you can repair weapons without a repair kit so throw them away when they break. That‚Äôs the wrong way lol but a problem for another day.
---
BOS gives better resistances.
---
BOS breast and scout appendages is the way to get the resistances maxed.
---
Thanks for the offer buddy...
---
but **PSA**: you cannot move your CAMP after someone built stuff you don't have the plans for!
---
Well, do you know the story of Fortnite? Multi-player open world survival/building game that wanted to join the Battle Royale clan. They made their new mode f2p, as a way to also promote their paid game, then they realized people were more interested to pay cosmetics in f2p BR than enjoying the paid base game, and they slowly stopped working on the paid game.
---
I think too that f2p NW could attract some people, but I don't want BGS to think like a normal company do "more money from less work". I'm not saying Epic Games is not doing content for their BR, but think about it, how big an update with new content must be to make the players feel that they can put many hours to discover new things.
---
Look at raid 94, BGS puts time and people to do it but it doesn't take long to people to do it.
---
With less time and less people they could revamp one map area in NW, no need to work on npc, no need to work on loot/craftable things, etc. They add some funny things in that area, like a lake full of goo that make you jump high. And that's it. In BR they don't need a lot of content to make the player feeling a difference.
---
I'm not saying NW is bad, imo it's a good BR game mode. But I don't want them to crush the base game to make it a BR only game.
---
Maybe the level limit could work, since most people that shit on the game haven't played it themselves, or just a few hours at launch. Yesterday I met a level 60, he starts 2 weeks ago, and he was telling me that he's still enjoying the game, the bugs were irritating him but the game was nice to play, there's a lot to learn.
---
Finally someone with some sense in a sea of "what if we had ___?" posts.
---
Link?
---
So I got the only useless scout armor part üòï not lucky as it's a bolstering+1 strenght ***.
---
There needs to be an influx of challenges. There could have been 200-300 atoms in it incrementally if for the scorchbeast/scorched genocides we could have earned like 10 atoms for 5 scorchbeasts or 50 scorched and so on, shit like that is the only thing thats gonna keep me on fallout 76 with this delay. help us track our kills AND reward us, and not with just possum scout badges. New players arent even aware of that. It kinda hurt to go back and check challenges ive already done to realize that theres a chance they stealth nerfed select atom pay outs in favor of in-game rewards like scrapping a weapon gives you 3 repair kits is one that i was like ‚Äòok so that wasnt a thing at launch....‚Äô
---
While they haven't come out and said "we want this to be the update that turns the game around" we all know that's what they're aiming for.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
‚ÄúRewarding anyone no matter how you play‚Äù is the biggest problem I had with this game since the beginning.
---
This philosophy is true under any aspect of this game, not only the atomic shop. 
---
And that‚Äôs the problem with this game, that‚Äôs why everytime they work months and months for new content the player base can finish it in less than one week then start to get bored again and demanding new more content. 
---
All the quest and rewards are designed to be idiot-proof (infinite resources, no consequence in dying, PvP only on demand, no more dropping junk during events etc.) 
---
You can‚Äôt even call this game a survival anymore. It‚Äôs more similar to Sims than a survival. That‚Äôs even why people get bored and are obsessed more with cosmetics than gameplay style mechanics.
---
Agreed, I guess Bethesda just can't be held to the once high standard we all held it to. The thing that bothers me the most is the wasted potential and the lies/misconceptions they keep weaving.
---
All that's being added and I just re-started FO4, now I have to decide which Fallout to play come 2020.
---
Great ideas. üëç
---
If i pay but didnt get the kind of stability that I am paying for, why should I even pay? Thats on my consideration
---
Damn nice piece there, and also thanks.
---
I know this sounds dumb, but one concern I have is that even from the little we've seen so far the NPCs all look very bland and generic. The guy from the announcement trailer had very generic "Fallout-ey" dialogue and the NPCs in these new screenshots seem like theyre all gonna be typical forgettable characters with lines like "Those raiders stole everything from us. Now we're gonna give em everything we've got". 
---
They seem to lack the idiosyncrasies and originality that characters had in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Back when Fallout 4 was about to come out I said the same thing about Preston Garvey in the trailers and everyone thought I was crazy, but it turned out I was right all along.
---
It might be what they are aiming for but what they deem as turning this game around will not be what we expect or want from the update or our notion of turning the game around.
---
That what I'm trying to emphasise 
---
If we go in with low expectations of what this update actually will entail we won't be disappointed and anything that does appear that surprises us will be a bonus
---
It doesn't matter if nobody wanted them.  They put the scavenger protectron in the shop and everyone bought it.  It had nothing to do with whether players wanted utility items in the atom shop.  Players bought it because it offered utility and they were disadvantaged without it.  Bethesda doesn't care what effect buying utility items has on the game.  It doesn't matter how negative their addition is.  What matters is every player will want to buy it because it's the only way to get that utility.  If you want a scavenger protectron or a fridge to delay spoilage then you have to go through the shop.  Cosmetic items a player has to like.  If a player doesn't like a particular style then he won't buy that item.  He'll get something else or nothing at all.  But a utility item?  A player will want every bit of utility he can have.

I am collecting raiders armour of level 15 n level 25 to build a few full suit to leave at train stations. Still missing some parts for 2 sets of armors.
---
Legendary modules are only for craftable vault 94 legendaries
---
I've seen claims that it's Bos Chest with Leather Limbs
---
I came here expecting the drill and sarcasm, lol!
---
Glad to see I was wrong üòÅ

* Poseidon Power Plant
---
* Fissure sites
---
* Wavy Willard Water Park
---
Who ever was duping was invisable eather using chemelon armor/mutation or a stelthboy so u couldent see them.
---
For damage cap issue both are similar as explosion count as separate hit although when you consider pvp only direct hit will matter because of fire proof, about pve almost everything was explained i just want to add that explosive is slightly more effective vs strangler heart.
---
What system are you on?
---
Awesome design!
---
Can you explain to me why I should bother with that, because I am leaving? I don't get this much used "joke".
---
Good question!
---
Find a spot with a good amount of crates, Bolton greens is a good lower level player spawn, it‚Äôs not very popular so you won‚Äôt see much action and you can usually find at least one orange crate and a few yellows
---
Stick to the bushes and take it slow, seek high ground wherever possible
---
As you gain overseer ranks and more cards try to decide on a general build for what type of weapons you want to use: full auto rifles, heavy weapons, explosives, shotguns, and melee are a few with auto and heavy weapons being the most popular 
---
Don‚Äôt rush in to things, don‚Äôt shoot the mobs with a gun, use a crossbow or melee to take them down
---
\*"Our approach to these items at launch was to keep them purely cosmetic. But after looking at all the data, it became clear that to consistently deliver content that keeps Fallout 76 fresh and exciting for all, we needed to rethink our approach to the Atomic Shop. While we had many ideas on what to add to the Atomic Shop, one of the ways was the direct result of the community‚Äôs feedback."\*
---
It's unbelievable how greedy liars like you can even sleep at night. 
---
Whoever had to write this pathetic justification of unlimited greed, you should be ashamed of yourself. Unfortunately, if you're working for a company like Bethesda, chances are you don't even know anymore what shame is.
---
People keep talking about how unfair it is to them that they are renting servers, and then renting the servers to us for a higher price. I would have been more than happy to unburden your friends at Bethesda VIA MY OWN VPS but I'm afraid they're just too greedy - they don't want my help. THAT is how the Game Server rental industry works; It feeds on people who don't know how to set up their own server and you are clearly one of them. Now stop defending scammers.
---
Been playing solo since beta.
---
According to an old [interview](https://www.fandom.com/articles/fallout-76-mods-and-private-servers) we won't be able to switch between private and public servers. 
---
This is year old and gives the reason as modding, that we don't get at start, but I think this still holds true.
---
I had to buy mine for caps lol
---
Nice lol and exactly
---
Personally, I'd have a lot of fun if they'd just turn off the stupid camp limits. Get rid of "part of the structure would be inaccessible" and "intersects with another object"
---
Hahaha yea. Maybe that ‚Äúgood‚Äù server thing is true for purveyor
---
Then you know a lot of gameplay and events are centered around this being a multiplayer spinoff. Yes you can certainly find enjoyment out of this game solo (I play many sessions by myself), but you can‚Äôt deny you miss out on a lot of you don‚Äôt want other players around (vending, queen battle, raids, season events). 
---
The idea that this multiplayer spinoff should be solo only as some have said would result in a pretty boring product.
---
This may not be your point, if so, just ignore.
---
Hahaha yea I was shocked and hopefully your luck gets better
---
Good point......
---
Yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hearing works but idk. I would try 3 or 4 then maybe hop servers
---
Hahahah awesome!
---
Try RDO, not very fantasy, but lots to explore ,new roles to level and a camp to build up. Not to mention the single player was fantastic.
---
The answer is no. I have multiple mule characters that don't know basic plans and they're still able to pull from the default item set at the Purveyor. Great question though
---
I still like the idea another Reddit user posted about converting some of Valley Galleria into an atom shop with a robot vendor. Basically a store where the actual items are on display so you can see the size etc. I've been put off buying stuff in the atom store because the photos aren't the best. It might also increase atom sales because everybody knows that buyers remorse is the #1 way of making people not want to return to a store.
---
Also the game needs more pistol perks, I have 11 points in other categories I could spare but those 5 perks take all my AGI tree and the damage one's can't be swapped because pistols need all the damage perks you can get to be even remotely viable
---
I can‚Äôt remember ever getting a Grognak‚Äôs axe from her. However, if they do drop, that may derail this idea.
---
No because you can get all the old weapons even withoit plans. I got ultracite laser and gatling plasma and many other i cannot craft. Same for my lvl 5 mule,which cannot craft pretty mich anything.
---
U forgot the /s lol
---
Whoosh
---
My friends and I are in this exact same position. We are looking for the next game to co-op on until wastelanders is released. 
---
PS4 has The Last of Us as a free download at the moment so we are all going to give that a try for now
---
I got three minguns lol. Tbf they weren‚Äôt that bad but still
---
Yea I agree. Modern Renegade,Gunn runner and the pistol weight reduction are useless. I wish gun Fu was in perception since it's a vats perk and adranaline was in endurance. That would free up space and actually benefit most builds. Except rifles. But it's fair because it this point rilfes make zero sacrifices.Ive posted a bunch of times how pistols either have to choose sneak or damage skills they can't have both. Yet rifles which are stronger to begin with get to take everything with no sacrifices other than being heavy. They get damage, sneak, crit,vats, stagger, limb damage and armor penetration skills while giving up nothing.
---
Dang. Interesting that you have to get the plans for The Fixer for it to be available from the Purveyor but not anything else. Oh well. Case closed. Thanks for the info!
---
I've been trying out Destiny 2 since the base game went free to play, it's pretty cool! There's loads of different PVE and PVP modes / raids etc. The world's look amazing too.
---
I cannot believe people are still defending the devs choices at this point. I give up. I was hopeful for this game and its core concept for far too long, whats the point when the majority of players suport reducing this game to absolutely nothing but a cash grab.
---
And to all the people who got the fridges and bots with earned atoms... I hope you enjoy grinding atoms for p2w mechanics dor the rest of this games lifespan while the rest of us move to games that actually value us as players.
---
The Bear Arm too
---
But dont you think it would be stupid that a level 1 player can do as much damage as a level player
---
I've had 1000 scrip for over a week now, plus a bunch of legendaries in my inventory, including some pretty sweet 3 star items that I don't use... So when Uranium Fever popped on Wednesday and I saw there was a lot of people there, I just went there, popped up the gift icon, and started dropping them one at a time. Everyone there got at least one 3-star that time!
---
‚Äú, but the execs and shareholders‚Äô end game is monetization.‚Äù
---
FTFY
---
My main spent 900 and it‚Äôs all garbage. My lv 52 bloodied guy gets 6 usable pieces, including two AAE and a bolstering chest with 500 scrip. ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
The silo code challenge is broken - it was last time it did the rounds too.
---
Sheep squash bone club thing or hook as well
---
ITV?
---
Haha im having the exact same issue same place. Tough as nail. Hits me and i just melt.
---
i bought 12 2* ranged weapons and even though they were garbage through and through i didnt recieve any copies or similar weapons
---
It appears. 
---
Then disappears, then appears else where. As it likes to do.
---
What would someone pay for the legendary one?
---
Wastelanders was pushed back for several months? Why?
---
I have the feeling the colossus will be more of a boss thing
---
so far every c.a.m.p. i've been to has a collectron, so it would seem players say they don't want utility items but will get them anyway.
---
Now that I have no idea. I'm not into the legendary trade scene. I'm more or less a nurse who will slip and extra stimpak your way for 5 caps.
---
Wow, No idea how I missed reading that. I think I saw the "So much more to come" link and just clicked that instead of reading reading that sentence. 
---
thanks for pointing that out :D I appreciate it
---
Im sure they just need more time to fix stuff and make sure it works properly, its probably for the best... But .... Just damn..
---
Reminds me of fable 2 and 3
---
Yup. I like to min max but after almost 150 levels of sneak rifles it gets boring. At least I can abuse my Bloodied Bolt-Action pipe gun since it gets buffs from both the rifle and pistol damage perks and can be silenced
---
Eso but heard good things about borderlands 3 thus far.
---
Kick your feet up and watch it go down? I dunno, I used to think a lot of the assumptions 'round here were BS but sadly most of it has come true.
---
So many other fish in the sea however (ie other games or better new/old hobbies). I got my fair share of entertainment &amp; I'm just gonna sit on the fence.
---
Not much, compared to melee weapons that do more damage or almost any ranged explosive.
---
1200 atoms please, and no you cant use free ones
---
We really have no details yet about the private servers. I'm sure this coming Thursdays inside the vault they will give us more details. I'm hoping for the ability to place more then one camp. Since it's my private server,  I should be allowed to lol.
---
I mean junkies is pretty good and those secondary effects are as good as they come
---
Yea or eliminate weapon levels completely but have their damage scale based on a particular special like the did in New Vegas. That makes sense because it's like become more familiar or proficient with that weapon type. But in the essence of balance have the scale cap at 20 special or so. It would give people a reason to seek +1 special attribute armors like they do for melee weapons.
---
man, the beta week was the best Fo76 experience I had since launch
---
I'm hoping that the private servers will allow us to change limits but I dought it will, I'd love a private server option to have no camp budget so me and friends can build a town together in one camp or having the camps closer together
---
Come on guys! Grab a shovel! We need that plan. 
---
I actually do. It's the last thing I need for my chemist scouts badge.
---
My luck will b better if they raise the scrip trade in 3x. I got 400 worth of weapons n armor to trade in ...
---
I would definitely enjoy more content. More stash. More camp budget. It seems strange they want me to buy Atoms for camp stuff but don't give me any room to build anything. It's self defeating.
---
I wish there were more quests. Right now I'm not doing much. Mostly farming. Can't keep my vendor full. I sold out several times yesterday of bulked junk, stims, meds. I couldn't keep up! But farming/selling is going to get old quick. I genuinely enjoy the Fallout IP and 76 has so much potential. It might be good they delayed Wastelanders. Maybe it means less bugs, more quests, more polish.
---
Conan exiles. My girlfriend and i were playing this before 76 came out. We recently went back to it, until 76 gets its shit back together.
---
Does the power armor cause lag?
---
it's speculation, I assume it's based on the early game challenges which were changed from giving atoms to giving useless crap
---
At work so I'll be brief...
---
I'm one of the last people that should be or really want to defend the game. Been playing since day 1 and always enjoyed it but will agree after doing all the quests (schorched earth about 50 times lol), all events etc. it's starting to get a little boring. 
---
But I can't agree with the few comments I read from people saying they're level 30-70 and don't know what to do anymore. They haven't done half of the stuff in the game, probably more. Just no way. And b4 somebody answers all pissed off yes I know because I had platinum trophy on ps4 in April and still find new locations and stuff I haven't done...
---
Post it on r/market76 ,for a junkies collector or a junkies melee build it‚Äôs a god roll , you could get 7k-11k
---
Thats a suitable name for that kind of behavior.
---
He could have been moving all of it from one character to another character (mule), or even to another account (also mule).
---
Oh haha I read your question wrong, I thought you said how many caps did I have üòÇüò≠
---
Says who?
---
For PvP, yes.
---
But with PvE, you don't need ER but more DR.
---
BS. I bought a scavenger because I wanted a little robot buddy tottering around the place. Any 'utility' he offers is not worth mentioning. I could collect more scrap in 30 seconds than he does in an hour. As for the fridge. It looks pretty nice, but I think it's too expensive. Do I buy it? No. Am I 'disadvantaged'? No.
---
Can people stop pretending these things matter. It's Fallout 76, not the Olympic 100 metres where you might win or lose by 0.01 of a second.
---
How many do you want for it? I'm coming on now, my gamer tag is: Rachel jennings
---
Since I dislike most cosmetics I just got the fridge and collectron with my free atoms. It's not that I want utility items in the shop, it's that I don't want to get left behind as Bethesda goes further and further down the slippery slope.
---
Yes PC.
---
&gt; And depending on the level of adrenaline the damage numbers change. Bloodied to non bloodied has change. Also distance to target. I do less damage if she is flying than it on the ground. 
---
That's why I put an emphasis on shooting the SBQ in the head, on the ground from point blank range and seeing the number 50 pop up, thus none of the factors you mentioned were in play.
---
you spend two to three times as much just in atoms a year as I spend in full games lol
---
Tbh, after a year the game still isn't worth the 60 bucks I paid for it. So yes, private servers should be free.
---
I misread everything - I have the grey scout mask not the forest one. üòÇü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Might be snakeoil, no one can tell w/o looking at the rng-code.
---
But reports suggest so, and to me it makes sense to hop when the rng is fubared on one server.
---
Oh no i hope you find him...
---
Take it and sell it.
---
The excitement, it was so nice. It's a shame a lot of the issues that plagued old beth titles rose up quickly. I kept hope that at least the game would be good enough to outshine that. Just feel shit now I fell for such a shallow attempt at diving into this service bs that calls itself fallout. Playing the horizon mod for 4 really helped me forgetting ;p
---
I hear you. A few farm plants, some turrets and the crafting stations, and I'm at 80% budget. Having to chose between a functional house or a pretty one, I'll take functional any day.
---
This is incorrect and confirmed by the Dataminers AMA. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master\_thread\_for\_the\_dataminer\_ama\_oct\_13th/f3m7awn/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhco2s/master_thread_for_the_dataminer_ama_oct_13th/f3m7awn/)
---
Also that's why I began with " *She does not scale."*
---
i waited 15 minutes just in case that was the case. He never came back and he's floating in the sky but left the server
---
We don't know for certain but one could presume that the world would be at a bare minimum semi-persistent. That and controlling who can join the server is about it for now I would have thought.
---
Given how I'm guessing Bethesda is, I wouldn't be surprised if you couldn't have the world permanently persistent. I imagine that some garbage collection and server downtime is going to be required from time to time.
---
Later there'd be mods, world settings you could change e.g. turn off pacifist so it's PvP only etc. For now though, not expecting much different from base game.
---
I‚Äôm actually considering switching over to Outer Worlds since it comes out next Friday. 
---
But I‚Äôll probably still log it to do the dailies and weekly challenges, so I can build up atoms.
---
How is anyone disadvantaged by not having a collection? It can only collect 10 weight if stuff and it's not like it can collect anything we can't find lying about, and as for the fridge the backpack mod works better and is portable so if you don't have a fridge (I don't) you're still not at a disadvantage, I know people don't want pay to win coming in but even the repair kits don't offer any advantage except not using resources but even the better repair kit is crap compared to fixing it yourself with the right perks.
---
Good. I don't want to. 
---
So I misspoke exact terminology. My point is that they are supporting a game on 3 systems. They are going to plan out their support of the game for those 3 systems. 
---
They arn't going to keep supporting PC players after the other two (much larger) player basses  dry up.
---
There is no scaling or damage bug in this case as I (we) could kill her after all, but it was awkwardly inefficient given the numbers.
---
That was the first thing I got from her.
---
&gt;thats because they are a little game feature. Locking that behind a paywall is extortion not good business practise. I would like to have them to. But as game reward, so i didn't and will not buy them.
---
Them either uses a mule (what deserves no merci imo) or is just stupid (what's pretty much the same imo)
---
Funding the team? You mean funding the investors.
---
I got 3 crappy crossbows, 3 crappy 10mm machine guns, a crappy pipe pistol, a crappy railway rifle, a crappy grenade launcher and a crappy gatling laser. Not 1 single fixer or handmade üôÑ now I'm super overweight and have to do the 150 script per day to get rid of all that crap cause I can't trade or sell any of it. UGH
---
Uhh...yes you can.
---
Plenty of updates to the Atom Store :) Not holding my breath for much until next year content wise, I will be back in the New Year and see how things are.
---
not nice
---
Oh and Day Tripper obviously didn't help lol
---
You get a temporary perk from those? I just get generic quest loot and xp!
---
&gt; While it requires change and effort on Bethesdas side 
---
And therein lies your problem. 
---
This Bethesda is one that'll rather do something quick and hacky than do a job properly. It's precisely this reason why people were so pleasantly surprised that Bethesda delayed Wastelanders for alleged quality reasons.
---
It'd be nice if they have skins be available for all relevant models but I just don't see them doing it. Not even for financial reasons. Just because of the effort required.
---
Forgive me for not knowing, but is there a way to tell the difference between the 2 after they are modded? I bought it from player vendor. In my mod menu, they both look the same.
---
Oh I 100% agree with you, didn't really come across in my op. 
---
I don't get why they remove events, if they kept meat week and the parade in it would feel a little less content light.
---
At this point I'm not convinced they can just keep bolting on things to the core game. Maybe they have insurmountable technical limitations we don't know about.
---
Feels like the more they add the worse it performs and the more issues they run into, one day it'll reach a critical point and birth some schizophrenic AI...
---
Im gonna put my 2 cents on the matter and say go junkies. 5 addictions for 50% more damage with everything is nice. Sure bloodied does a bit more. But at the cost of relying solely on serendipty in my opinion. Yeah some bloodied builds dont cool good for you. But still in my opinion a full health bar is better than a quarter health bar. Run those perks like serendipty and nerd rage still and you can just stim when you feel like you get too low for your comfort and with first aid even 2 thats most your health back anyways. I have no problems with any mobs, when i shoot the sbq i can visually see her health drop when i shoot her.  I also run a high luck chr build, Mainly for bloody mess 3 and a few points of surpressor and tenderizer. So when i shoot something it takes 5% more damage from anything. And deals 20% less damage. So really with that 50% damage from junkies is more like 70% (15%+5%) then add pyschobuff thats 95% damage with everything. That doesnt even include damages for what you are built into. So the least amount of damage added with a weapon you can get with junkies with 5 addictions is 50%. Which is still more than what the majority of people will get with their builds no legendaries.
---
i completely  agree unfortunately the only thing i can do is to no more buy bethesda (or EA, Ubisoft, Activion/Blizzard etc.) products. I hope i won't be to hard when Starfield or the next Fallout comes out. I guess it will be overmonetized like this shitshow. That will make it a lot easier. 
---
I'am skipping AAA titles alltogether since a while (exception F76) and have more fun playing older games and indy titles.
---
It's hard to get excited at such a basic feature this far into the games life. But yay.
---
It just keeps getting worse...
---
I use guns and I can't remember last time I used a stimpack
---
I have an instigating swing speed, it‚Äôs a fun little tambo
---
Yeah :(
---
I don't know oh, but let me know if you find out. The radio plays nice and fine but all the holotapes are super low and I have yet to find a way to adjust this , in my control settings through my Xbox are all the way up
---
Ah yes I remember now, often it'd such a rare cryptid that it'll wear off before you find another one. Unless it's a Wendigo, there are loads of them but you don't need the buff! ;p
---
I watched some SBQ solo videos and she clearly have more than 32k hit points. More like 70k+
---
Can't answer a simple question eh...
---
Maybe he gave up on the game (bc of the delays and stuff) and decided to drop everything he had so others can use. 
---
There are plenty of games out there and maybe he likes another a lot more. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs yours man! Sleep well at night, no worries ;) 
---
If your on PC, I‚Äôd love to have a look if you wanna sell any of your new found treasure :P 
---
Also, when transferring really nice weapons (like the ones you mention), usually you would use a friend in case of a disconnect. Also, if the stash you found was a common place, it was definitely NOT a transfer. If it was a very hidden away place...maybe. But I think he just gave up. The fallout76 news that came out yesterday sucked...lol
---
Fair, makes sense.
---
They drop. I have a hunters extra power attack one that wrecks SBQ
---
How exactly how are you getting swarmed if since last patch there's always 50 people there blowing the shit out of anything that moves in seconds lol
---
ones mans trash....
---
Making alt accounts on Reddit... Or else, how u supposed to post incel shits on /r/relationshipadvice ?
---
yeah at current prices I don't expect to ever buy atoms lol
---
Where did you see that info, that you won't be able to switch between to two?
---
.308 and .50 are Hunting Rifle Snipers
---
.45 is Combat Rifle, you can't mod it to .308 or .50
---
&gt; I guess it will be overmonetized like this shitshow. That will make it a lot easier. 
---
Bethesda has clearly shown what kind of company they are.
---
They want to monetise modding and have microtransactions for full priced titles.
---
They want us to do the work of giving them ideas of things that we want in the game, charge us for the pleasure to have them and then gaslight us saying it's them responding to our feedback. 
---
The feedback thing especially galls me because they conveniently ignore the feedback we've had regarding selling non-cosmetic items, not wanting the things we asked for to be sold on the Atom Store etc.
---
76 was meant to be the redemption arc for the missteps of Fallout 4. People stopped giving Bethesda a pass after Fallout 4 and we're starting to see these chickens come home to roost.
---
I really do hope it's just a BGS Austin issue and not an overall studio issue. Cause, if it's a general studio issue, I fear for the outcome of Starfield. Certainly not looking forward to it.
---
No. It's not intended when you know for a fact your screwing over everyone else.
---
And you do it anyway and think it's normal
---
I use a B2515 .50 for SBQ, and since she doesnt receive any explosive damage from a BE one, its definetly better for that. On other situations BE good too, but i prefer to use a B25 in any fight.
---
Also 5 point on demolition increases the 20% explosive damage to around 32% which is not a big damage gain.
---
I'll buy it, great rolls but not very effective from a dps standpoint. What you want for it?
---
Bingo!
---
Where do you even get the idea the playerbase on XBOX and PS4 is bigger than the PC playerbase?
---
In totality, a good 62% of all video games is purchased on the PC. The other 38% is split between all other platforms.
---
Discounting the mobile game industry (which is huge in terms of revenue) PC is larger than the consoles combined atleast since 2013. In the early 2000's it looked like PC gaming was heavily losing ground to consoles, but that dynamic switched back around in recent years.
---
Tldr: Why do you assume the playerbase on Xbox and PS4 is far bigger than the PC playerbase?
---
If you sit at the title screen that long enough to care, you're doing it wrong
---
Huh, that's optimistic. I read the announcement ad the final nails in this games coffin. Get ready for 6 months of no content other than atom skop 'utility' items.
---
Exactly not hard at all especially since it announces when the damn legendaries are coming in...
---
it was definitely a seculded unlikely to find spot. This was either the remnants of a mass dupe that's going around, allowing several players to pick up items from containers, or a failed attempt at hauling duplicated items between accounts. Most likely the first as i waited a very long time for him to come back, AND sent him a friend request
---
Mission 3 then.
---
Even stuff like ammo converters or food packaging stations are pushing the limit.
---
Agree, I'll still play but honestly I'm finding it difficult to find things to do each time I log on, it's a struggle to keep interest in this game. There's only so many times you can do a round of whitesprings or deal with the SBQ before things start getting samey and it seems that is all you do.
---
Visiting interesting player camps has become my goal of late n with the advent of private servers soon I can see the amount of them dwindling and player count on adventure, i can see the dedicated servers becoming ghost towns
---
The Death Tambo is second only to the death claw gauntlet. I have a bloodied one on my ranged bloody character for when I"m forced into melee, and it hits for around 300 a swing.
---
As an unarmed weapon it gets bonuses from both iron fist and the gladiator perk trees - so with 12 cards you can get +90% damage on it.
---
The encryptid event is huge especially for the fixer plan reward. Players whom completed The lowe-down quest in Lewisburg Van Lowe Taxidermy are able to launch the Encrypted event.
---
Join this event whenever you see it or launch the encryptid event if you are able.
---
lol dang that sucks but it would be nice if they had a script banking system but maybe you need a mule
---
More like a week after release.
---
Oh also it was just weapons, not armor, not chems or ammo, just a ludicrous amount of 3 star legendaries
---
thanks for getting it :D
---
32K (Non-scaling with player count) with 70% Damage reduction are datamined numbers
---
I concur, shotgun build with max enforcer puts.down glowing ghouls almost immediately. I have a 1 star 2shot pump action level35 that I'll go to nuked Whitespring with.
---
I use a weak Tesla rifle.....it‚Äôs the bloodied guys one shotting them.
---
If you're on PS4 I could sell mine later but the market rate seems kinda high
---
That hasn't been my experience at most maybe 3 other players. Maybe its because how late i play not really sure, ive been on servers with no one on them and its strange.
---
I love that stupid robot, just for the things he says. I never remember to to actually take the scrap, and it's honestly not really worth it.
---
Good. It shouldn‚Äôt be free.
---
Thanks brother but I'm an xboner :)
---
Thanks for being a badass though!
---
I'm pretty sure you're wrong on this one, I tested my damage with a med-x addiction and was able to get the same damage values.
---
I am, I should be on at 9 as planned that work for you?
---
However mass dupers do not deserve mercy as they can completely destroy the economy
---
tbh the mold issue wasn't related to Bethesda
---
Yes. Private servers are coming next week - as a paid service!
---
&gt;The ability to play in your own private world with your friends has been  the number one community-requested feature, and we‚Äôre thrilled it‚Äôs  finally coming. Our goal for players who purchase this service is to  offer something for everyone, not just those who want a private server.  Additionally, in the future you‚Äôll be able to mod your worlds.
---
So they will charge us for modding...I hope it's just a one-time fee, but I guess it will be a subscription-based model. Because we need to pay for the (additional) infrastructure.
---
I agree with your comment except it's not panhandling, it's a subscription-free game-as-a-service so they have to keep selling stuff to stay online. However, I stopped playing a couple of months ago, partially because after you finish the main and side quests, it's like "go hang out in a cave in a clown suit" every other day. There are so many different outfits, why is it always a clown suit? Little things like that pile up to make it not fun overall. Then you're right, they had that Quakecon bundle and I thought I should buy it, it's a discount but this game seems to be focusing on stuff I don't want like NW and $30 cosmetic bundles. Who knows if I'll keep playing? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Maybe my comment will klt be well received, but if you have been playing this one game for over a year, how can that be bad?
---
Maybe it is time for something new?
---
I played since release, but stopped this summer for the same reason, but am still excited for wastelander.  Playing ESO right now, until Outer Worlds next week. But I will be back when wastelander is released.
---
All this to say, I am not mad and feel I got more than my money worth from 76.
---
So, it looks like it's a big and I've lost my .50 mod at some point. Thanks everyone for the input!
---
They gave up.
---
What do you mean post them? Scroll the fuck up and read.
---
Doesn't matter what they datamined. Those numbers are wrong or outdated or something. I see this guy hit SBQ with his bloodied DCG that does like 3k damage per swing and he has to hit her for more than 10 times to bring her down to half health
---
Im on Xbox :(
---
What's the price on them for the record?
---
Yeah then sell skins for the item.  Like how the fridge could have been, put it in game then charge 300-400 atoms to change the design on it. This could work so much better, especially if people buy multiple skins for the fridge.
---
There is no multiplayer, there might be dlc but that's bout it.
---
do you need the plan learned in order to get rolls?
---
It‚Äôs posts like this that legitimise Bethesda‚Äôs announcement yesterday that the community is crying out for ‚Äòpay for convenience‚Äô stuff. You‚Äôre feeding the dog that bit you.
---
What time zone?
---
Get one of those letter sets and write it on a wall.
---
Yeah I keep rolling the event by purchasing the recall keys and then crafting the key card... But I'm starting to get low on mats...at this rate I don't think I'm going to get the plans before the end of the 50% off script deal.
---
Eastern
---
you probably dont have the mod unlocked
---
my guess is that you had the mod as a physical item when you modded your current rifle that way it was "consumed" try to scrap a few more hunting rifles to unlock the reciever
---
What's good is subjective
---
Considering you play fallout 76 you should understand that better than anyone. The world is against you.
---
But the outer worlds objectively looks like a cheap indie borderlands knockoff
---
OP thinks everything should be free.
---
They are in the game. Just go to the mire.lmao
---
Which was expected because it's the norm.
---
You're lying, but okay. Repair kits arent substantial, but they do make the game easier. You're going to suck Bethesda's dick no matter what, even while they are openly telling us that they are making the game more pay to win.
---
He wouldnt be naked then
---
i dont think this is real i was rolling her yesterday with like 5 open carry weight and still got mostly heavies and i'm a commando build
---
Ah fair enough, I've seen it sell for like 10k or even up to 15k which seems super expensive to me
---
Lol we've been asking for it for months now dating back to release, almost a year later finally added to the game.
---
We also need more flags.
---
Finally private servers!! 
---
 No more getting killing while afk at a settlement!!! 
---
No more people trying to kill my deathclaw with mobs or grenades...
---
No more randoms punching you in the back while shopping...
---
No more low level wanted on teams with high level broken characters... 
---
No more greifers.
---
Thanks. You are the first person to post it. Nobody would know if it weren‚Äôt for this post.
---
Yes, I've wanted this for so long! I'm tired of looking everything up on the wiki to see how it looks not on a mannequin. There are things that I haven't bought because I'm too unsure if it'll look good on my character or not
---
When people can trust that a game runs smoothly, without glitches and numerous bugs and on stable, reliable servers, and that game has a good effort to reward ratio with decent content then they might trust you to spend some more money on the virtual shop. Just sayin‚Äô.
---
Yes I agree
---
What am I lying about? Lol. 
---
Seriously... do you even play the game?
---
You're lying by saying these items dont give you an edge. They do, even if its tiny.
---
I'd easily pay 10k for them... Oh I'd kill a man for cross play with my sony brother and sisters.
---
You just cant admit that pressing one button to repair weapons is easier than the process you described. Lol so disingenuous. Imagine lying about video games just to make a point.
---
This gets my vote! There‚Äôs some great camps I‚Äôve seen with it but it‚Äôs very rare.
---
Also can we have floor plans apply to the small square and rectangle flooring...
---
Yeah, it's Bethesda. What else did you expect? They been putting out fire for months. One more won't hurt them, or thier rep at this point.
---
I have the feeling Private servers Will not be what some people think. Bethesda Will not just say "Heres the game, fool around". Restrictions Will make it just slightly different. Like, maybe you can block users and be sure griefing Will not disturb you, or allow high level players only, shit like that.
---
I may try and do an RP server. Seems like it would be super fun with the right people.
---
Why would I spend atoms to save 20 seconds repairing at a bench? That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. Atoms are a finite resource. It would be silly to waste them on repair kits.
---
Im in the eastern part of us...ive had several times when ive been on server alone. I feel like once private server come in to play that public server will empty out, i guess we will see. Very cool ur from italy one day would like to travel there before i die.
---
They also said the store would be cosmetic only LOL
---
Disagree, to a large extent.
---
I might be in the minority, but I don't consider myself disadvantaged.
---
I dont need a scavenger protectorn; I collect hundreds of pounds of junk every time I play.
---
Similarly, I dont need a 'fridge; I have good doggy and I don't care if I get a disease from raw meat. (thats what disease cures and antibiotics are for).  
---
  I have a few repair kits, but only as a result of helping beat the Queen.
---
Point is, I don't need the ultility, so its presence (or not) in the Atom shop makes absolutely no difference to me.
---
Mods for the Crossbow maybe ???? I mean give me a break some mods for weapons that have none .. what am I saying I won;t hold my breathe waiting... we could give these guys a year to get wastelanders out and it would still be a fucking mess...
---
It's complete garbage PSA - I spend 2000+ scrips yesterday and I was overencumbered after 3rd weapon I get, and guess what - I still get various weapons - hunting rifle, shotgun, pipe and .44 pistol. What's more, on the same server one character get 4-5 good items (i.e. Weightless/STR/WWR scout armor, unyield/END/AMR, 3\*IE Lever, BSS+1STR melee) and another 0 (I know I was on the same server, since I put mutant's tesla to trash can outside station, which was still there when I logged in with second character).
---
Tons of people buy the items. It takes money to keep a game going long term. Stop being ignorant to that fact. A lot of people buy the items and are happy with them. These posts from the angry minority on here are tiresome.
---
They should release small things like new mini-events and perhaps even something like an extra traveling merchant. 
---
If they introduce NPCs slowly as travelers  that don't necessarily have quests attached it would be interesting. Especially if they don't announce and it's discovered randomly.
---
Ive received 50% pistols.
---
this is what mod makers implemented in first months after game release, and it takes 1.5 years for bethesda. They are fools if they think  they can keep playerbase alive with such slow development
---
Why do you say PC market is bigger when it‚Äôs not?
---

---
Cosmetic is open to interpretation. It‚Äôs harder to argue a weapon isn‚Äôt a weapon lol. 
---
Maybe I will eat my words but there is zero evidence they are going to add weapons in atom shop.
---
Got some great rolls recently: feel like it is easier to get awesome √≠tems. However, some people are not that lucky: had one guy shooting mininukes to the scrip machine today and cursing like a sailor.
---
I've got Barbarian, Ironclad and Evasive with high STR and AGL on top of the resistance mutations and endgame armor, so my DR+ER is actually higher than it is in power armor.
---
Lol you can't do it. You cant just say that a one button press is easier. How does it feel to have to be dishonest to defend games you like?
---
Wow i can't imagine how much 2000 hours if when i feel how long I've played it's only 650 hours
---
Seems pretty reasonable that private servers are paid for. Alot of games already do that, what the issue?
---
I have experienced cases where a shot or swing would have the correct damage number pop up but the target's health doesn't change at all. It's not the healing-back bug.
---
&gt;Cosmetic is open to interpretation.
---
LMAO
---
they need this perkload out yesterday.
---
If the developers can provide interesting enough cosmetics to convince people to buy them, then maybe they were the ignorant ones, not the people that bought the game that were specifically promised cosmetics only.
---
Disco Elysian looks amazing
---
Well I remember the exact opposite, prior to the releasing of refrigerator, they actually buffed the longitivity of the food and drinks. Check the patches it you don't believe me.
---
As for those perks, let's just say only food builds include those, anyone with a right mind would not put up those perks for regular use, except noobs.
---
Man I wish we did this in my graphic design class rn, because we are doing some stupid artistic digital collage when I want to be making logos ads and actual designs
---
It‚Äôs not even one button if you want to be technical, it‚Äôs 3. Same amount of buttons. They only difference is you don‚Äôt need to be at a bench. Why would you pay atoms for that? 
---
Seriously now answer my question... do you feel at a disadvantage for not buying them since that is your entire initial premise?
---
I've sent you a direct message
---
This. You had a mod, you used it.
---
It is...one definition of cosmetics is ‚Äúsuperficial features‚Äù. That definition is certainly open to interpretation, is it not?
---
Saying people haven't asked for other items other than cosmetic is a straight lie. There were tons of older posts asking for things. If people were upset about them or against it then they wouldnt be selling so many. Fridges and collectrons also do not break the game in any shape or form. It's a game meant to be around for awhile. Obviously things are gonna change
---
You can go to most vendors at train stations and buy the plan, not the mod. LEARN the plan by reading it and you can mod all your hunting rifles.
---
genuinely not trying to be rude but you‚Äôre acting very entitled. This game is a business and a service, if they did not monetize the game in any way they would LOSE MONEY. servers are expensive to run. The game did not sell well at launch, and yes that is their fault as the game was launced buggy and incomplete, but if you want this game to be better they have to find an incentive to continue updating it. Bethesda is a business. It doesn‚Äôt help that they don‚Äôt get much sales in the atomic shop. If you want to blame anyone blame Zenimax for making them shit out this game incomplete and buggy
---
Yeah, but from what I've heard from PC players is that the player base isn't as big as it once was.
---
Yea there is still so much unknown about them.
---
I would assume that you would need a new character on private servers because when mods come in you could really ruin the official servers with stuff brought over if they let it happen.
---
I'm not triggered at them, I'm a bit pissed because some people would just blindly believe some 'datamines' over video footage of an actual fight. I mean WTF?
---
To be totally honest- not trying to be a shill for Bethesda here- paying for servers is honestly far more reasonable than 90% of the things they expect us to pay money for in the atomic shop.
---
Have you tried sleeping with one on the ghouls ??
---
I love this! Great job, I hope you got an A!
---
Got a flatwoods monster for that event last night. That was right after seeing a wise mothman near Berkeley springs.
---
Absolutely love it! I could imagine if you create an alternate version that was worn and weathered it might even look like it came from in-universe; some real 4th wall breaking stuff there, lmao.
---
Ok. But some of us(pc) who have either hosted or used private servers for multiplayer games( DayZ, Rust, Ark, Battlefield) have a vague idea of the how private servers work. Characters cannot migrate from private to public is one. Battlefield for example, which I have the most experience with, if you make a bunch of changes such as respawn time, damage % etc then you have to make it an unranked server but if you keep it vanilla you leave it ranked and that characters level and gear carry over. DayZ though, you can private server jump to gear up and have all the best weapons, plenty of food but once you hit a public one you‚Äôre at square one. Bethesda should follow this foundation.
---
The game will never be ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù. 
---
Yes it is more stable than launch. Still some bugs, seem to affect some players more than others. I haven‚Äôt been disconnected in a long time though. 
---
There are some additional quests added that are fun (lying Lowe, brewing, pioneer scouts) but they aren‚Äôt huge from a time perspective, though they are fun. 
---
New battle royale game mode is fun and different. 
---
Big update coming in q1 next year.
---
Yeah, but that is on both consoles together, the sale numbers that is. individually the Xbox and PS4 communities are smaller than the PC one. And since there is no cross play you have to look at them all separately.  
---
True, there is piracy on consoles ofcourse. But in totality I think that is one category where PC absolutely dwarfs all the other platforms. The ease with which someone can pirate games on his PC, combined with how long this has been possible to do this easily vs consoles has practically ensured that.  
---
I know no single pc player that doesn't have atleast a handful of pirated games (often because they're no longer available through normal means, but still), I know.... 2 guys that run some under the board stuff on their consoles.
---
I know that feels
---
This is an odd question. It's an mmo, there will always be bugs and other problems. Story will be added in bits along with content. As is every other mmo since gold star computers came out.
---
I mean its an mmo what did you expect?
---
Lol I like how it aggravates you enough to make a post. I probably would too though.
---
No shit i dont get this at all. I was rewarded some type of kits and have no clue what it was from. I have never once used any type of kit. There are multiple work stations spread out in almost every location on the map. Its not gonna take all day to find a crafting station that you need so why worry about saving the 2 minutes that it takes you to run to a workbench
---
Did the assignment have a font quota? Because there are too many, imo.
---
I got a QFFR railway rifle and a van sent combat LL last night
---
Well you could still unlock it by level with a single card system. Each rank may require a certain level to acheive
---
Tissue for tears? Be silence while crying please.
---
Said the guy who asked "who hurt you" because he couldnt defend his point.
---
Yes, normally no console can win PC when it‚Äôs alone, maybe PS4.
---
Yes, PC is king in piracy and cheating for the obvious reasons.
---
Imo consoles will dictate the future of Fallout 76, let‚Äôs see what happens with the new generation, but for now it seems games will be backward compatible.
---
But you know what? The only culprit on all of this is Bethesda, they released a super buggy unbalanced game with no endgame content.
---
I totally disagree with this community about utility items. A fridge is not a pay to win item. It's barely help keep food fresh for longer. The repair kit is not pay to win. It just allows you to fix your items without using resources. The only thing I think could be argued that is pay to is is the scrap kit in survival since killing other players to get there scrap was a thing but since there is no survival anymore no big deal. This community is one of the most toxic entitled one I've ever seen in gaming.
---
Yep I'm going to do that this weekend üôÇ
---
Possibly, but no card currently works that way, right? It's the same reason lockpicking and hacking are divided out too.
---
Same. I have the bot with entirely free atoms. The bitching about the shop is ridiculous and childish at this point. "*I want it now!!*"
---
Well. How about they earn enough atoms (without buying a shitty hat instead) to get it? Apparently that's unacceptable despite the bot and fridge together costing less atoms than the green backpack and free states outfit (700+500 is less than 800+500). 
---
FFS people pretend it's real money and just save up atoms. I've earned about 3500 in the last 7 weeks or so.
---
Or use a 2nd card, which nets you an effective 11% increase for +21% overall
---
Not more work it takes the same amount of perk points as the current system and it would free up an additional  four perk slots so you could run a higher rank of both if you so choose. Agree to disagree I suppose
---
Exactly. In fallout 4 you would pay 5 bucks for a completely new type of power armor and it always came with a fun little side quest for you to do. Now on 76 if you want to change the color of your standard pa you pay almost 14 bucks. What a ripoff
---
Came here to say this!
---
The real issue is if they allow drop rate, xp, resource gathering or spawn manipulation.  It would turn the public server economy upside down if you can drop between while being able to manipulate these on a private server
---
I drop nukes whenever I'm on, but I'm on the PC.
---
I do from time to time.  but after 1000 queen kills and random nuke drops, it starts to become harder to go through the process.  All the effort to experience the same thing.  Why are there not more bosses at each fissure site?  That would spice things up.
---
Last time I checked my pipboy it worked on all unarmed weapons (which is broken).
---
What‚Äôs good is subjective. But what‚Äôs bad is not? So again, what‚Äôs good for you?
---
AND they've released this spin story which basically states that they're not really going to deliver anything they said they'd deliver in 2019, but focus on monetizing QoL things that should have been in the base game to begin with.  
---
My birthday is in november, so my girlfriend bought me a boxed FO76 copy for my birthday. Boy was she pissed when it went on sale right after and when I showed her the monetization they've put in the Atom store recently.
---
RNGs gonna RNG...
---
I don't know. I usually don't... It's just been this morning.
---
Flux isn't in high demand and the Queen still isn't fun to fight/is still super bugged, I would imagine.
---
I will not be surprised if the mod is a better implementation of whatever Bethesda puts in place.
---
[](/ajgrump)
---
Now I just need the option to become a Ghoul myself, always wanted to look like a melted human ice cream.
---
I defended it. You just didn‚Äôt like the answer. Cosmetics are debatable. But there is zero evidence of weapons being added to the shop lol.
---
It was just annoying enough I guess. üòÇ
---
How much flux do you need and what do you need it for?
---
Ammo &amp; mutations... Ammo for the SBQ-fight, and mutations to sell...
---
So at a point it becomes an empty motion and boring.
---
Mine too, I guess we‚Äôre both scorpio.
---
Gladly I got Fallout 76 after a while for under 20$.
---
And don‚Äôt forget we still don‚Äôt know when it‚Äôs going to release, February? April? When? What about bugs? What about all the bugs?
---
Im going to play something else and wait, I have GamePass, WOT, RDR2, WARZ, etc, etc......
---
If you only wanted to use 3points to maximize the damage bonuses it is better to use three cards at level 1 than one card at level 3. You get 10%more from three level 1card than from a maxed out card. 
---
I just think the card system should reward you more for max level. Even if they went to 1* = 5%, 2* = 10%, 3*= 20%. It‚Äôs the same max bonus but is more rewarding to max level cards.
---
I would totally refinish the bottom of my pool if they do.
---
*update: disconnected for the 4th time (in an hour and a half's time.) Grr.
---
On Xbox I'm finding that it kind of follows a pattern.
---
Mon-Wed nothing happen, Thursday they start to drop. Friday Crews start tripple dropping them jumping to Arktos, Then it becomes casual weekends with intermitten nukes.
---
Yeah thing is, I bought other things too with my atoms (in game earned only), and they... Sucked.
---
The greenhouse dome? That shit is almost impossible to build if you aren't in a plain, but you can put it on top of two defense barrier.
---
And the other skin/camp item they propose are either broken (looking at you, Dixie clock) or stupid (of course I want a princess castle bed for my post apocalyptic raider camp).
---
I took the collectron because it's already shitty as hell not to be able to build screws, the least I could do was ensure I get the junk everywhere. And the bot is funny.
---
I'd say Furious alone isn't really good on a railway since it has low fire rate but I recommend using vats with it.
---
I'm a bloody melee build and I have a tesla rifle i use at these events.  I hit the legendary once then let everyone else kill it.  I have never understood why people feel the need to one shot the legendaries.  There's nothing in it for them.  It's not like they'll get a better drop or anything.
---
Is that the blue and yellow ones?
---
I usually drop nukes every weekend. It becomes more of a chore when you've done it 500x for a 1* nocturnal pole hook. 
---
It does get fun on occasion when all hell breaks loose. Doesn't seem to happen as often anymore.
---
I spent 4000 scrip and got nothing but garbage. Put it all in my vending machines at dirt cheap prices. Won't be able to try anymore, got a wedding in the family this weekend and won't be home until late Sunday night. So I'll be selling scrip weapons and armor all next week. I will not waste my time with the purveyor anymore. In all the time it's been out not one good item. At least I get good drops off mobs.
---
I read it as you'll be able to gain atoms from things like "sell 100 pieces of meat to a raider vendor" or "sell 20 items to other players" or "buy 5 guns from player vendors" and stuff stuff like that.
---
Friend and I debated this, so we thought we‚Äôd do an experiment between us. He started purveying and got solid garbage. We decided to continue our exchanges on that server. 1150 for me (16 2-stars and 15 3-stars) and 650 for him (13 3-stars).
---
We spread our purchases out, 2 bursts for him and 2 bursts for me. All the while staying on what appeared to be a junk server.
---
For heavy weapons, I got things like a Nocturnal 50, a couple of Fat Mans w/ Exterminator‚Äôs and Assassin‚Äôs, Hunter‚Äôs and Troubleshooter‚Äôs mini, and the only useable, kinda, was a Hunter‚Äôs Explosive LMG.
---
I managed a shit-ton of terrible lighter weapons, and came away with a Vampire‚Äôs FFR Reload Cryolator. And that kinda sucks because I already have a Vampire‚Äôs FR Weight reduction Cryolator =|
---
He got a mishmash of useless items like VATS Instigating Gatling Plasmas andFurious FFR flintlocks.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs total coincidence that some servers give garbage. I‚Äôm starting to lean towards something in the code isn‚Äôt as even each time a server spools up. It‚Äôs like getting on a server and seeing graphic glitches, but changing servers and it‚Äôs gone.
---
I dunno =|
---
I carried every good weapon I had with me to see if that skewed things at all (likely not).
---
Disappointing. Not even anything I can expect to make money on, either =(
---
[end un-scientific anecdotal report]
---
Interesting. On PC I see fewer nukes at Whitespring, but have seen the usual frequency of nukes at the SBQ.
---
Is that on the markets? I'm listing my Bulk Ammo Scrap for 50 caps each in my vendor and while somebody eventually cleans them all out at once, it takes a while for that person to come along.
---
Great work. Also good to see something positive and productive around here.
---
Nothing I said was opinion outside of my comment on what I'd rather them do with atoms though. Here's the thing, we are all allowed to have our opinion. That's fine. You can be ok with a ptw game (not the stance youre taking, but just an example). There's nothing wrong with that.
---
What is wrong, is being OK with a company outright lying to you, and then defending them for doing it.
---
I'm all for arguing opinions, but I don't see it as an opinion to say that it's wrong to buy a game promised one thing, and then after you spend your hard earned money, be told "lol jk." 
---
Is really simple what I'm arguing. 
---
False advertising = wrong. 
---
Are you arguing that in your opinion it's not wrong?
---
If you got one amazing item, then the 2000 scrip wasn't a bust. Expecting more than that is the problem.
---
I really hope we can host our own server, or get them from a host of our choice...
---
I have seen like 5 or 6 nukes dropped in the past week on Xbox.
---
I don‚Äôt blame you lol
---
Why did I actually lol at this?
---
Raw flux is the physical plants you pick in the nuke zone and they go into aid and have a condition. Then when you get glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluids, off of enemies in the nuke zone,  they combine with the raw flux to make stable flux. Stable flux then goes into your junk. Lots of things take different types of stable flux; rad showers, jet packs, ultracite ammo, serum recipes etc. You can also sell it in your vendor for 80-150 caps a piece. So it‚Äôs worth farming white springs for stabilizers (glowing mass, high rad fluid, hardened mass) and other nukes areas for raw flux. You can get a list from the enclave bunker that tells you what plants turn into what flux. Hope that helps
---
Are they blue? Always looked black to me - either way these ones:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGQkIIQUk8Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGQkIIQUk8Y)
---
Yea Ive decent luck with it but I‚Äôve mostly got my good stuff through trading
---
I still want this.
---
I tried yesterday and the game crashed while at the purveyor. I couldn't fast travel to my team after an hour or so, it only allowed me to join them, but I was already on the same world.
---
Tbh even an increase to 9- 15 dmg  for the chainsaw would make a hell of a difference
---
It didn't benefit from most perks but I'm sure adrenaline did work with the "weapon" ( could be wrong tho, it's been a while since I last used it lol)
---
I agree that the v fast weapons need some love and attention.
---
Legendary versions would also be a nice idea
---
I earn my Nuclear Winter cosmetics by hiding in the pipes below Mama Dolce lol
---
I guess this question relates to this post, but if I leave something in say a trashcan at a train station, a public spot, and log out and then log back in. I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôll hopefully be on a different server.....will that stuff be in the same trashcan or will it be stuck on the server I left it on? Kind of a noob question, but this is my first FO. I‚Äôm level 121 so I really don‚Äôt leave stuff in public places unless I‚Äôm dumping unneeded scrap or ammo.  I‚Äôve  just always wondered. Thx
---
Nah sorry man lol Xbox

Putting all of the bonuses into one card makes it hard to keep skills at multiple tiers. 
---
In a 6-tier card, you cannot have a rank 2 &amp; 4 because if you upgrade, it will always upgrade the highest-level card until it's max. 
---
Until they add a way to de-level cards, combining the cards would limit flexibility.
---
Hit 100 like 3 weeks after NW came out. Haven't touched it since. I feel like the cosmetics is why anyone even plays that game mode at all.
---
Sagittarius actually :p November 23.
---
I held out hope for the "run for presidency" enclave mission, along with stuff like the enclave backpack they had concept art for, and a frikken X-01 enclave skin and all, but they seem hell bent on alternating the cosmetics between generic "Raider" and "Settler" shit, and over the top "Clownsuits and tinfoil hats!"
---
That looks great! I remember that class at my high school. I loved it. InDesign, Flash, Photoshop. It was so fun and  a great learning experience.
---
Well, there won't be any bashing but power attacks, so I'd say just buff the power attacks of these things to like 10 times its own damage.
---
If there is a legendary chainsaw I'd not hesitate to get online and farm the shit out of it.
---
Yeah I mean if they just handed out killer weapons people would be bitching it was to easy to get lol.
---
Jesus. Get a clue, man. It's not too late to turn this trainwreck around.
---
It was a bust for me as well. The biggest problem for me now is I literally have 50+ legendaries with my stash capped and over encumbered. I can only scrap 3 legendaries a day because of the ridiculous 150 scrip limit.
---
Good!
---
Don‚Äôt even start me on ridiculous stuff, because this game is all about being goofy and jumping like rabbits!
---
Last night it was me and one of my team members left with only one other guy in the final circle, as it closed in I watched those pipes and out he comes haha. He didn't last long but would've got some decent XP for 2nd.
---
&gt;u/Redbiertje Overseer
---
Same here, I don't buy anything but cosmetics.  
---
Their decision to include non-cosmetics doesn't outrage me though, it just annoys me slightly.
---
I'm not saying you're wrong in what they said, but it's the nature of the beast that is an mmo that makes change a necessity. It keeps things fresh and interesting. I guess I'm just of a different mindset. What are we arguing about in its simplest form again? A fridge and other non essential items. Again, people are buying these items en masse, there no magical pool of a few whales that keep us afloat. If there is then thank goodness. We need them. No, the truth so many refuse to believe is that the vast majority of sales are from the average Joe, who is excited about the items. Remember, it's a cup of coffee and a bagel to buy MOST items. I keep saying this because it doesn't seem to connect, but if the items in question were so hated people wouldnt buy them. They do, and guys like me in a 1 bedroom apartment are buying them. This ptw thing is utter nonsense. You seem like a reasonable person. Is my robots collection of raw rubber and my fridge going to beat you in pvp or pve?
---
Wow that would of been good. I must have done that event way over 100 times and always Wendigo or Megasloth.
---
There are so many obvious opportunities for cosmetics like in-game faction-themed equipment other than Raiders and Free States. I wonder what the hang up is at Bethesda?
---
Enclave Officer uniform variants? Taggerdy's Thunder Power Armor? Responder's CAMP items?
---
Why the hell is everyone so concerned with how many people are playing? It's not like they're going to cancel Wastelanders or shut down the servers.
---
I'd welcome less knuckleheads in Whitesprings, West-Tek or stealing my workshops. They'll be back to try the new expansion.
---
I agree that furious isn't great on railways, but the fire rate on auto railways is plenty fast. I think the problem is that the magazine (#10 rails) is small, and the base damage is high enough that most enemies will be dead before furious builds to much.
---
I was wondering about the date as well! And yeah muscle memory is a bitch, especially with fallout and going between other games. I tried using vats alot when I played the MW beta. It was annoying
---
I don't play other MMOs, if you're saying this is how they all are I think you're just supporting my point.
---
Yeah- although I support the opinion that the Atom Shop shouldn't have non-cosmetic items -at the time I found the whole Unstoppables \[forgot the name, thanks lol\] hate to be pretty ridiculous.
---
I mean, it really doesn't help that the Friends List has been broken for, what, 6 months now?
---
Shit man that's some serious pro gamer movesüòÇ But yeah NW is my go to online shooter rn I love it, but when you get like 100 caps and some XP for level 250 main it feels pointless. Not even a stats page with a K/D to maintain.
---
 Literally LOL!!!!
---
Exactly, it ruins PvP, it ruins RP, the lack of persistent objectives also ruins Faction Play (factions are just window dressing anyways, no consequences on anything.)  
---
Makes one wonder why they even bothered really. They could have made another FO4 expansion instead adding a BR mode and be done with it. It'd probably be more balanced because OP legendary combinations could have been prohibited there lol.
---
Looks dope!
---
doesnt aggravate me at all..
---
Yes
---
They should be parts of waves attacking bog town with swarms of mutants.
---
They‚Äôre designed for human sized hands, PA is much larger.
---
Those are all good tips! Gotta give that text some room to breath
---
I bought 2 items so far. The cultist torches and the cultist icons or whatever for my camp, and honestly I almost regret it. I just don't want to show my support for the atom shop, even though it doesn't matter much my doing so or not to them.
---
I think that's a really great point.  Even if you game on PC, the console jumps are going to be a problem for any games-as-a-service product and I'm sure 76 will be completely outmodded (even more so than it already is) by the time those next-gen games come around.
---
Even if it's not optimal, it's hardly useless. There's diminishing returns on DR, so small differences like Scout versus BoS aren't perceptible.
---
Alright thanks man!
---
Just how many hours do you play per day? It takes me 3+ hours to hit 150 scrips so I give up most of the time. How is 150 not enough?
---
"We heard from many of you who wanted items with some real utility"
---
And outright ignored the countless more who wants the atomic shop to remain cosmetic based. Classic!
---
I got that message from Graham, I had 100 pounds to spare at least that was just a glitch though
---
Some stats would have been nice haha. Wanted to be one of the few with the Hellfire PA set running around the wasteland. I had tons of people stopping to take pictures with me lol. Now I'm seeing them more and more. Lost it's luster a little haha. If they add new items I may make a return haha.
---
The fuck are you even on about
---
/r/averageredditor
---
Because they didn't want the game flooded with legendaries, but look what happened anyway lol
---
Love it! I agree with the feedback you've been given. Also if it were me I would have made the background in PS then all the text in AI to not worry about pixelation.
---
This kind of thing always impresses me. As an artist I always thought i could do "anything" ... LOL WRONG!! Turns out graphic design is as much a unique skill as any other art form. Well done!
---
No, the items in the Atom Shop now are barely an advantage. The only non-cosmetic item that I think shouldn't be in the Atom Shop is the Repair Kit \[which allows you to automatically repair you weapon once per kit\].  
---
I believe that as Faction Wars become a bigger part of the game the Repair Kit will offer an unfair advantage since players who purchased them will be able to repair their weapons instantly.
---
The Scrap Kit really just serves to help Scavengers, which I'm ok with. It doesn't interfere with PvAnyone at all. The Collectron is essentially just a cute robot pet that sucks at the one thing it was created to do \[collect\].
---
Brah. I get it done in an hour or so, and that‚Äôs if I don‚Äôt find some for cheap in player vendors. I‚Äôm short on space in my stash quite often nowadays because I can‚Äôt scrip everything.
---
i totally agree with this, i got one broadsider and promptly switched servers
---
Nah y‚Äôknow what? Let‚Äôs stop applauding them for potential content that has not even made it into the game yet. 
---
This should have been here on release, and has been an major annoyance to the majority of players since launch. I‚Äôve grown so sick of changing out perk  cards, that I cba to change my cards to unlock/hack the vast majority of locked boxes/terminals I now find, leaving me one less thing to do in this already scarce world. 
---
Why the hell do we not have passive perks for these situations? Poor game design is why; a cheap and sloppy cash grab which they‚Äôre only now attempting to patch up - and are doing an awful job of. 
---
Why should we be cheering for a QoL improvement which they shipped the game without, left the game without for over a year, and only now are hinting that we may see it at some point. 
---
We have no details on it, we have no pricing structure regarding it (cause let‚Äôs face it, with the new article this week, it‚Äôs looking like anything is far game to go in that store now) and we have no release date. 
---
You want me to give a cheer for them? You are severely mistaken.
---
It's something that really annoys me as an unarmed melee build, I could understand not being able to fit knuckles for instance over the PA gauntlets but a Deathclaw Gauntlet should be able, same with the Mole Miners and PowerFist
---
As a low level I love when high levels do this during uranium fever, cause I'm usually too busy killing the normal ones to notice the high levels
---
i hit 150 in less than an hour 3 to 5 3 star enemies and i have 3 3 stars worth 40 scrip each thats 140 then sell 2 1 star boom 150 less then an hours work
---
How do you do that? Mind if I ask you for some tips?
---
Thanks for the clarification! I knew this had to be a case of misinterpretation. Like I don‚Äôt have scrips this second to test it so I was hoping for a comment like this.
---
Anytime anyone brings fixing the chainsaw back into the conversation I'm all the way here for it.
---
That would just make sense.
---
Me and a bunch of buddies have been looking forward to this since private servers were announced last year as something they were working on. Wouldn't surprise me if we get an RP thing rolling on the private server, all things considered. We tried to do a little bit of it back in March, but it just never fully panned out because we couldn't take Workshops without getting torn apart by jerks with explosive miniguns it seemed.
---
I would love these. Missed them the first go-round.
---
It's funny how Bethesda never replied to any of the 100+ threads complaining about that fridge and collectron and have now twisted the story and act like we all loved it. Shame on you Beth.
---
Queen of the hunt does spawn vengeful mothmen sometimes, I've had 3 maybe 4 though so it's definitely rare,I think I've seen more in the wild honestly
---
If you farm Whitesprings a few times a day and join anytime Uranium Fever, One Violent Night, or Project Paradise starts up, you can hit the cap pretty quickly. And after this sale, because I cashed in 850 scrip and filled up on tons of weapons, the problem becomes very obvious, given that I can only scrip 3 of them a day. Basically, they're gonna take up all my stash space for a long time to come
---
fakenews until proven, noob 
---
share a video of you doing that at least
---
I agree with that. I think that Food Packaging Stations or Ammo Converters are things that should already be in-game. Things that serve small functions, like the Collectron, I'm fine with not being able to obtain in-game.
---
I was thinking the vault Tec tiles. I want those now though
---
If you come across a couple legendaries in a row, clear west tek. That‚Äôs a good one. Clear the ghouls at whitesprings golf club whenever you‚Äôre nearby, you‚Äôll usually get one or two legendaries there.
---
Do the mole miner event (forgot the name) next to whitesprings, if you do it perfectly you should get 3-4 legendaries. Fight the SBQ whenever it comes up, you get two legendary things minimum per fight.
---
Those are the best ways I think. You‚Äôll be overflowing if you keep doing all that.
---
If they seriously added a good fishing minigame id probably never stop playing, and i already play way more than i should
---
I should, but they were 1-shotting me through a window/fence which should block VATS.  I think either they were getting headshots or sneak attacks or I was wrong about VATS being blocked.  I can't do anything about VATS or the headshots outside of what I'm already doing, but I wonder if there's some PVP sneak attack mechanic that I'm missing.
---
I know about the dense mod and am still looking to find it for my gear.

I got a AAE hunting rifle last night
---
So I just took Hemlock. Was about to finish the second wave of defend and I was hit with a couple bullets. Look to my left and there was another player. He was invisible but you could still kinda see him. The odd thing is he did no damage and didn‚Äôt try to kill me immediately. I got out of there though and went to a different server. I just needed some acid.
---
It was the slipperiest of slopes
---
It was the slopperiest of slips
---
I thought so. I just wanted to be sure.  
---
It seems like there are people who say 'I AM STRICTLY AGAINST ALL NON-COSMETIC ITEMS IN THE ATOM SHOP NOW AND FOREVER,' and then there are people who say 'Well, I never asked for these things to be put in the Atom Shop, but I'm ok with them being there.'
---
It wouldn't surprise me.
---
Like I've said before, I noticed this same phenomenon with Bethesda's Doom 2016, a vastly more acclaimed and successful game.  Everything was rainbows and sunshine until someone was like, "That it, we're pulling out," and then no one spoke of it or updated SnapMap ever again.
---
I don't like how *every single thing* that was talked about for the rest of this year has been pushed back to a vague "Q1 2020."  Yeah, okay, Wastelanders needs time in the oven.  But what about all this other broken stuff?  The friends list is still hosed.  The Vault Raids aren't great (and wasn't there supposed to be another one?).  What happened to the balance pass that might shake up the meta a bit?  Is anyone ever going to acknowledge the damage rubberbanding?  Even things as simple as that "quality bar" we stub our toes on when walking between cells.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it already give you a penalty to those? I lose food and water like crazy when I vendor hop lol
---
I have an idea for a power attack build, but it's PA because of the arm mods that say less AP cost for power attacks. But my best Power attack weapon is a bear arm. Well it's not the best but it's the one I wanna use
---
No thanks.  Caps are easy as hell to get anyways. Managing food and water is already a chore.
---
It used to, in hardcore mode for New Vegas if you travelled too far before eating it sleeping etc you would show up dead.
---
Absolute rubbish, didn't have many scrip (I don't make a point of farming legendaries) and the best I ended up with was an exterminator crossbow with faster reload, which replaced my existing crossbow.
---
I like that you actually help and don‚Äôt just bash their work. Thanks for being a decent person.
---
Or they could just let you select which two you want to combine.
---
Of course. Sorry, I don't intend to mislead. I still think that'd be something I'd be happy with in 76 providing it meant regular content instead of just relying on microtransactions as a way to make money. ESO also has a microtransactions store, but I'm not compelled to buy anything from it as there are plenty of in-game rewards such as cosmetics to keep me engaged. A lot of the Free States bundle could have been rewarded for completing that story arc. 
---
I really enjoy the current Enclave arc as it is, as earning the commendations meant doing the Enclave specific events which rewarded me a different piece of scout armour. I'm not sure if that is still the case now but it was something I appreciated and felt fairly rewarded by.
---
How can you have consequences in world where everything spawns back including mugs and dishes when you log out?
---
Yeah I see it in the wild a lot but you‚Äôve always got the chance of it disappearing. Was it tough to kill for you too? Normally I take it out straight away but this one didn‚Äôt want to die.
---
Okay they could set a limitation or like a warning embedded in the fast travel that travellers should be well prepared for long journeys. If hunger/thirst are a survival element of this game, it could only realistically shift value into the way players perk up their survivalists
---
You are incredibly lucky with legendary drops
---
I've seen people talking about leaving who clearly never played the game...
---
I've also got it when trying to pick up stuff from my stash, particularly those large stacks of goverment drop holotapes and technical data do it. It has nothing to do with weight of the item, probably.
---
The game also has given elsewhere wrong errors, which mislead to think the problem is something it isn't.
---
Do you mean uranium fever? It is a great event for scrip farming
---
Not always an option for those without mics, and on pc there‚Äôs still no way to type chat with anyone for some reason, at least without mods.
---
I got trash from purveyor and have absolutely killed it in player vendors.
---
or light wood laminate
---
Popular because they're *utilities. They do something.* No shit they're popular.
---
wasnt there some kind of workaround for this before, like equipping the weapon and then enter your PA or somesuch, or was it patched?
---
There actually was a dataminded mole miner city
---
You know a 1 day sale of everything they ever had would be nice. some things i didnt know existed.
---
ahhh, i lvoe the idea of sometimes getting not fish but treasure maps/loot/old boot sounds fun as hell
---
Yes. It's mentioned in the post. Didn't actually read it?
---
So far the Utility items they sell just reduce the  daily grind of the game, and not by a terrible amount. Nothing that gives a real tactical advantage over any other player.
---
I don't see 76 as competing with the Outer Worlds at all.
---
Interpret that as you will.
---
Yeah, I don't ever recall asking for repair or scrap kits
---
Don't forget you can get more scrip by doing dailies now too.
---
There are rumors of it having a higher percentage to drop things that have entered your inventory lately. Try stashing all your items, then pull out the items with the effects you want to see. Then buy from purveyor.
---
I've heard this also works when farming legendaries.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs always nice to get 3x 3* weapons. Easy 120 right there.
---
I say well done I made it to level 16 and was incredibly bored by that point.
---
Rifle perks.  Any perks that apply to all weapons like Bloody Mess.
---
Perhaps OP is overestimating your humanity and generosity?
---
i dont get it? What IS the pen?!?!?!?!?!?
---
I can't say that drop rate is in any way normal.
---
[https://youtu.be/p0c5ZJVXFe8](https://youtu.be/p0c5ZJVXFe8)
---
Uranium fever, violent night and Project paradise are like once per 4 hours since they nerfed events, so unless you are playing all day you won't get them more than once.. I can think of better things to do than play this game all day
---
Making what? There's no link.
---
r/dumbassthatwontstopreplying
---
I would love to use power fist with power armor lol there should be a mod to make it bigger
---
I personally feel like the limit is very arbitrary. Our weight and stash limits already serve as a buffer to prevent people from rolling an unlimited amount, as does the fact that you get a third of the cost back. I think they should just remove the limit.
---
It exists BECAUSE it makes people play for a limited amount of time, and then feel compelled to log in daily. This means more exposure to the Atom Shop, and more opportunities for impulsive purchases. It's all about money. There are 0 aspects of this game that weren't designed to make more money, even at the expense of game quality.
---
If I find there‚Äôs a player hogging the kills I usually drop some mines to instigate PvP.
---
whenever this happens to me i think to myself ‚Äúwelp, guess that‚Äôs my problem‚Äù and then flutter away.
---
Personally I think they could just rework the [Stub Barrel](https://d32b8ciqbrecdn.cloudfront.net/G2G/listing/52/13/20190602044854_7197_4695811.jpg) since it looks just like the [silencer](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/dc/Sleepytyme.png/revision/latest?cb=20110928221147) on [Sleepytime](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Sleepytyme_(GRA)) from New Vegas to make it have reduced attack noise.
---
Just a note, but almost all weapon skins are just skins. I think the only craftable weapon was the alien baton thing. 
---
I have bought skins specifically to use on my legendary weapons so I can't sell them accidentally.
---
We would call the space between the text block and yellow border, ‚Äòmargin‚Äô. Is this a word they use in print too or just web?
---
Sadly, that's the truth. The bulk of that scrip comes from Whitespring and I just PRAY that one of those events will start
---
Oh really? I feel like you come across soooo many animals and soooo many cook stations that I'm always sizzling up a little this and that.
---
I'd just go back to whatever numbers were in place back when Weapon Artisan over-repaired them *and* their damage.  That was the last time anyone considered them viable, and when they nerfed that, they nerfed this entire class of weapons.
---
This. If you watch as your character enters power armor, you can see that the size difference is pretty drastic. The PAs "hands" are the same size as the weapons OP is referring to. What they should do is have more mods available for PA, so that a melee PA build would be viable.
---
YES please, its really the only thing i want aside from the red rocket big ass sign
---
I thought about it but I use Excavator armor mostly for the mining and carry weight bonus. I typically sell 5,000-8,000 rounds of .50 cal and 5.56 a week so I need a LOT of lead.
---
Actual sperglord
---
You're absolutely right. For this to work they need a steady flow of income. So how about this? Offer access to the game in two ways. First Basic Player level, you get everything you get right now, the game exactly as it's presented to us currently. Player Level Plus: A paid subscription, say $10 or $15 a month, offers a monthly allowance of atoms, bonus to camp size and build budget, access to exclusive cosmetic / build plans, free fast travel. I could get behind Bethesda if they offered something like this.
---
Maybe I didn't notice that. A cap penalty always feels like a flick in the balls to me
---
It used to cost you food/water as well and people thought it made no sense, forcing Bethesda to remove the feature.
---
Accurate, i do know some are introduced as weapons and later gets "fixed" to be skins (Imposter sheepsquatch head, if i recall it right)
---
Just felt like it should be included to cover the entire thing
---
I already uninstalled. Amazing feeling tbh. I'll stick around because I find the defense of this pile of shit entertaining.
---
This lol. You earn more points by staying alive longer than you do for actually killing people.
---
You stole *my* random number you bugger!
---
I originally played to get the crusader mask, and now with 220+ levels across several characters, I don't use any of the dang things. The samurai helmet clips though everything you wear with it, and makes your head one giant, shiny red, hitbox target.
---
Yes you do have a point. But having to carry extra weight for eating and drinking just to travel seems tedious.
---
Instigating, bloodied, mutants: those would be my go to effects on a railway. Maybe a Mutant Slayer for farming the area around West Tek, or ghoul slayer for Whitespring runs. Maybe.
---
Fantastic idea. I remember the first time I saw a crabs. One was hiding in the bushes near the Bog. I wasn't expecting it, I would have avoided it if I could have, but before I knew what was happening, it was suddenly a massive problem for me. I was low level, inexperienced, I put up a good fight, I did my best, but I couldn't beat it. I left it alone as long as I could, but I felt it calling me back, irritating me somehow, like an itch that needed to be scratched. I went back later and it was still there - this time I had the right strategy and I finally got rid of it! I've heard others talk about how hard it is to get rid of those suckers. Lots of people I've spoken to have had similar stories - some of them I didn't even know they played video games, let alone Fallout 76!
---
Personally, I think that the ability to bulk ammo shouldn't be an Atom Shop feature, and should really be a naturally in-game feature. It would allow me to get rid of a lot of unused ammo by selling it to vendors, which means I'd have a lot more caps and more inventory space. I'm not saying it's ptw, I'm just saying that I think it should be a natural part of the game.
---
That's true. I've played a few \[computer and mobile\] ptw games, probably around 4 so not really that many, ptw games and they are different from Fallout 76.  
---
But I think that that's because of the console. People who have a phone or computer are generally with their devices most of the day, either as a requirement of their job or possibly schooling.  
---
I, for one, spend most of my day away from my Xbox, meaning I can't check it every single second for a timer to finish counting down, which means I don't get the feeling of 'Augh, it's *so* close, and all I have to do is pay 5 Diamonds to skip the next half hour!'  
---
I'm not suggesting that Fallout 76 is ptw, it seems pretty far from that. I'm just saying that I think that ptw on a console would look different than what we commonly see on mobile or computer devices.
---
I would argue that offering every available weapon would change things for people who prefer not to do things underhandedly, but I get your overall point.   :P
---
Yeah, I perk the tru-traveller to reduce the weight, usually makes a pretty good difference. Perhaps when private servers let you set rules, I'll make my own little thang like this
---
Do you have access to this data mine? I'm interested in this.
---
ah not complaining, i'll turn it into more scrip and try again. actually got a great gun from a player vendor yesterday, instigating explosive lever action. happy days
---
Lol oops
---
We ran out of nukes :(
---
&gt; The rest were complete trash. I got 3 broadsiders in a row. How is that even possible?
---
https://xkcd.com/221/
---
Have it be that you can have a Power fist and mod it to a piece of PA
---
Isn't DayZ the other way around?
---
Server hop Public as much as you like, but each Private server is a fresh start.
---
I guess it amounts to personal preference. I travel around to make caps. So it's part of the give and take. I'm very lazy when it comes to food and water management lol
---
And if Bethesda does in fact "give us crabs", please have them give us swamp itch if we come into contact with a diseased one...
---
Immersion.
---
I'm okay with making a power fist be a required component for the mod. Sounds good to me.
---
Honestly, we need something like survival challenges in adventure. Not just for weapons,
---
but for cosmetics and skins.
---
Only in that unarmed weapons deliver more damage per hit than the melee weapons I can use when I'm in PA (which is about 99% of the time).
---
But if I can "fit" PA fingers around a normal switchblade, I should be albe to fit those same fingers around a meathook handle, and it would not take too much additional work/resources to lengthen the strap on a DGC or MMG to fit around the PA wrist....
---
Junk extractors are readily available and work far better than the collectron. You'll collect more junk just casually strolling through Flatwoods than it will.
---
Fridges only have 10 space, only give you 50% more time (IE 5 minutes becomes 7.5), stored food takes up stash space, they use up some of your CAMP budget in order to give you this barely mentionable, "utility..." I'm not seeing the big deal here.
---
Repair kits are worse than their improved variant which drop from SBQ fights. I have 20+ of those in my inventory and I don't even server hop to find people dropping nukes. Beyond that, both the paid and improved variants don't even get you to a full two bars. Paid only gets you 100% while improved is 150%. The measly 5 adhesive you save may not counter balance that loss of extra 50% to 100% durability. Not seeing the issue.
---
Scrap kits basically just save you a trip to your stash box and a crafting table. Things that are readily available at any train station, most player CAMPs, and one, the other, or both in various random buildings all across Appalachia, not to mention workshops. The game isn't dying because Johnny2x4 felt too lazy to find a bench so he bought a scrap kit.
---
Most of these complaints are hyperbolic concern trolling by people who don't even seem to pay attention to the game that they're complaining about. It isn't perfect and I don't want to see pay2win creep in, but their track record does NOT show that tendency and disingenuously trying to spin a grand total of four items into that needs to stop.
---
I cook &amp; eat way better in videogames then I do in real life

The Mr. Handy and Ripper are already killer weapons, if you find a bloodied one. You can buff then to hell with food effects too. Melee bonuses stack.
---
I only got 4. sucks man
---
Signing into private servers vs public is you‚Äôre signing into a different IP address. The private system will allow you to manipulate the world however you as the admin sees fit to you and whomever you share your password with. But all those adjustments will not carry over to public servers, different ip location.
---
I mean, you can't do anything else with scrip, so whatever you get is a bonus.
---
They shouldve made the ugly dirty eyesore fridge model like the one in the flatwoods kitchen  that no one wants free and still charge for the cleaner and more cosmetic ones
---
Yea now you have to do a decent amount of damage to get loot. Most people think to aim for 6k of damage to get a drop. I think they fixed it because low level players and non contributing players were showing up and doing no damage and collecting loot. Which is good because every person at the event adds to her armor buff.
---
Love how they mentioned they added Collectrons because we asked for it despite existing before game was released as shown in footage and guides. But one thing I agree with author is how they hide everything behind atomic shop purchases for majority of the content despite very people buying things like straw hat or 2076 glasses and should be given through game or allow both purchase through atomic shop and located by in game.
---
It's okay to play something else. If you're not feeling it then you shouldn't force yourself to keep playing.
---
No. Same both ways. You can server hop through all public servers but those changes stay in the public domain. If something has changed then I‚Äôm unaware but it‚Äôs been a few months since I‚Äôve shut down my server due to the fact the game seems to be going nowhere.
---
I &lt;like/dislike&gt; the &lt;thing&gt; and &lt;think/don't think&gt; &lt;Todd/Dev/Bethesda&gt; are &lt;good/bad&gt;. Let's &lt;love/fight&gt; one another to &lt;death/completion&gt;. Give me &lt;upvotes/downvotes&gt; or you are S A L T Y
---
Oh I totally agree. My comment was intended to be in support of the idea. Honestly, if everyone is dead, who are we paying for travel?
---
Come to think of it NW could very easily be converted to a PTW character player (like 3 dog) pvp arena, with zero effect on adventure mode. Imagine the content that could pay for.
---
I kind of did this last night too.. I usually run a variation of explosive handmades. Last night I got an executioners sub-machine gun from Mmurgh. I had 1k of 10mm so I went to run west tek with it. It was a pretty fun time and that gun hits way harder than I had expected. I actually saw my highest hit I think I've had with it. Sneak, Crit w/ adrenaline and I hit 650 on a super mutant with it.
---
I seriously love this game.
---
You must be young because a margin has been around since before computers and college ruled notebook paper.
---
The paragraph also mentioned utility items being shared with other players to use, but another issue with that is its not. You get a scrap bot and lock it so people don't take your shit.  
---
I loved and hated the article. I love that Wastelanders is delayed, it shows that they're taking their time and polishing the game before it is released. That gives me a lot of hope.
---
But I also thought their input on the Atom shop was incorrect. More people complain about utility items than they support it. Its selective reading.
---
Specifically the Rifleman Perks (not commando as counteractive as that sound.)
---
Bloody Mess for flat extra damage.
---
Tank Killer for Armor Pen.
---
Batteries Included for reduced ammo weight.
---
If you will be using vats then concentrated fire (Plasma flamers are so short range there is no need for vats)
---
General:
---
Get some science perks to mod your gun.
---
Get some perks that boost your survivability.
---
Take the ammo crafting perks.
---
Tips:
---
Plasma flamers break fast-ish. Either carry more than one or invest in being able to repair/over repair.
---
Plasma flamers do ridiculous damage very fast, don't worry about getting the "perfect" legendary.
---
Plasma flamers actually benefit highly from the "Furious" legendary. It is not a trash legendary on this specific weapon.
---
Have a backup rifle.
---
Source: Use a plasma flamer on my non-bloody rifle build as a CQC weapon. It is redonk.
---
[](/spikeapproves)
---
Agreed.
---
I liked the way it was. It was fun to get a break from all the murdering to go do some events or just goof around in adventure mode. Survival mode just made me love adventure mode even more, and I could separate my two playstyles without a bunch of rules. I think that making it permanent would have made it harder for people to casually dip their toes into PvP. This game is sort of a hybrid of different games, I bet even hardcore pvpers don't only PVP 100% of the time.
---
I felt that wanting survival players to permanently stay in survival mode (along with a bunch of grueling mechanics) was really just a way to punish PvP players for wanting to play more aggressively sometimes. Or wishful thinking that "griefers" would go over there and stay over there.
---
My biggest gripe with the game is that fucking music
---
Bring me back to the OG
---
Who cares? Just separate private and public characters. Most private world users are probably going to do it to mod, anyway.
---
Or The Followers of the Abandoned Skull Toilet
---
Oh good idea
---
This one has more than your typical game. They need to do what they did with ESO and port it to a different game engine. The creation engine is just too old and has too many layers if code for them to effectively fix the game the way it needs to be.
---
Thanks!
---
Taking a short break isnt a bad idea, but here's a few other ideas
---
Rebuild your camp with a theme in mind. I have a series of tents and a real outdoorsy feel. 
---
Really specialise your crafting - I run a restaurant and have started making fasnacht donuts. They don't spoil and use some specific and slightly difficult to acquire ingredients. I run around in Slocum's Joe power armour giving them away to people. 
---
Get yourself a primed weapon. You'll have enough to do just making the ammo for it. I've got a prime explosive minigun and about 19k rounds for it and it's kept me busy!
---
Make sure you're doing your dailies, and Google a list of them to get any you've missed. 
---
Change your build entirely, work with one legendary effect and see how powerful you can make it. Anything can be good except nocturnal - that just actively sucks. 
---
Find rare displayable junk items and get a collection going
---
A few people kind of roleplay as NPC's and have quests they can send you on. I have a short one involving explosive bait and testing the theory that it can make scorchbeasts land. Craft some of that, head to the cranberry bog, hunt some bravos and make a cranberry meatball grinder
---
Finally finish those possum scout badges
---
Try out joining in with a group of people and see what they get up to
---
Joe mama
---
watch those margins, son
---
I'd say it will come around same time as Star Citizen.
---
Idk I eat way more raw sheepsquatch in game than real life ...
---
Private servers are coming in a week or two so that's kinda offline if you decide to rent them
---
Problem being that in game time is accelerated, so you'd see it flipping through numbers like crazy.
---
Same here. Grafton monster thrown in occasionally
---
Thank you so much!!!
---
I disagree.  The way they split up those perk cards allows for more flexibility.  As an example, It's nice to be able to swap out only one of my Rifleman cards when i know i'll have some locks to pick. Among the rest of the short-sighted, complaints-get-upvotes type posts on this sub, it's very common to see people wanting to be able to actually break down their 5 rank cards.   Plus, with perk load outs on the way, all the "i dun did forgitted it" types shouldn't have that problem anymore.
---
Yes I‚Äôve seen the Grafton Monster but only a few times.
---
A margin is the distance between the edge of a block and its container, whereas padding is the distance between the edge of a block and its contents. What I mean with adding a padding is that the text block will look nicer when it has a padding from the edge of the block it contains :). Hope it helps! See also: 
---
https://uxengineer.com/padding-vs-margin/
---
The odds of getting something good, especially the armor you're after, is incredibly low so I don't see why it even matters.
---
Modding will be supported through private servers and the game will always be online.
---
Nice.  I got garbage.  And the armor I bought were all wood.
---
Typical.
---
Have they confirmed cost for private servers yet?
---
No offence but that sounds like a dystopian future for me. Like "play offline by yourself for just one easy payment every month!" kind of dystopian.
---
Are you wireless or hard wired to the internet?
---
Prime it and make it auto. Then go pump some damage into the Queen with it.
---
lol yikes. How much did you spend?
---
I have both; they are both on the better end spectrum of minigun usefulness, which is still subpar in regards to HW. Pick your poison.
---
Different word for Bazaar,  followed by 76. You know like a MAR... we aren't allowed to post about it as it gets removed almost instantly
---
or write the name down and do it from main menu. always seems to work for me after fresh login and adding from main menu before joining a server.
---
Hard wired.
---
You're still connected to their Network though. But the fact that it's a Network makes it sound dystopian. Like a sci-fi dystopian novel, what if we were all connected to some kinda Network hivemind and weren't allowed to think independently?
---
They're not bad with three cards at three ranks for people running rifleman. But consider other builds like handguns. They get fucked over because they cant take damage and sneak cards and still maintain action boy or dodgy (if bloodied) all because agility is such a cluster. Yet rifleman get to grab all their damage cards,  Armor Peircing  card, the all the sneak skills and not worth about space in their special.
---
Is this the only thing that hasn't been rereleased? Ugh....I need
---
I can't link or say it directly but there is a MARKET for 76!
---
Gotcha. Wasn't sure if that's what you meant or not. üëç
---
I disagree and you are raider so you must be a griefer/butthole/something I'm againest.
---
My argument is Schrodinger's Fridge.
---
[](/ppseesyou)
---
I would love to see the vid!
---
Bloody handprint... Cleaner
---
While I‚Äôm certainly concerned, they said ‚Äúitems with utility‚Äù which means items with a use. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean it‚Äôs going full P2W, and I honestly doubt they could top Rockstar for aggressively monetizing a game. 
---
Think of the fridge, the thing is basically useless. It extends the life of consumables by 50% and only holds a few items. It‚Äôs only real use is if you where trying to make something and needed to keep ingredients from spoiling, or accidentally overproduced a food item and didn‚Äôt want to lug all of them around. 
---
The collectron is slightly more useful, but it‚Äôs not nearly as useful as perching on a junk extractor or even just looting yourself. The junk it collects isn‚Äôt the most useful or rare either other than the couple screws every hour.
---
I bought a serum recipe last week and have started working on crafting marsupials to sell to others cheap.
---
I think the fridge is a crown jewel to be presented up front and center of your camp.
---
Your father.
---
It is in the description... people though it would fire by pressing an action button but infact it has to be destroyed (stupid)
---
I'm angry because the fridge doesn't have slide out drawers for the freezer.
---
Flooping quit following me around. I hate arktos pharma therefore I hate you as well. How does one even floop a pig???????
---
If you never open the fridge it exists in a state of both having and not having drawers.  
---
Much like pulling down my pants to observe my drawers.
---
[](/joy)
---
IIRC people were suggesting fridges before that dude, he was just the first to put that he would \*pay\* for it. Hence the attention.
---
It does, which made me have to do a double take on this post.
---
And as someone else said before me, everyone's dead, so who the heck are we paying these caps to when we fast travel?!
---
I've had excess legendaries for almost 2 weeks, I can't get rid of them fast enough to how many I find.
---
Frustrations with crashes shortly after launching a nuke aside,
---
I think it depends on the day.  After the codes reset, takes a while for nukacrypt to publish the new ones.  Then its midweek, people work.   Weekends, high drop rate.  Lather, rinse, and repeat.
---
This is how I see it. A few months ago they opened up all servers to all regions, with no region lock. Before that, people in regions like Australia were just having the same people on every day. Not really many servers. On Xbox itself I've seen a drop because when I server hop it just starts being the same people after a few servers. With PC, from what I've heard, it's not as large as it once was. So the numbers are going down
---
Yea. I bought this item thinking it would be able to be used via a terminal or button.
---
This is the one item that I've gotten a refund for.
---
I dont grind for atoms, I dont even look at the challenges menu.  They just pop up from time to time.  I dont do anything special other then just play the game.
---
Lol thanks guys. Saw where I had 5 comments but this is the only one that showed üòÜ
---
Only about 500 or so.  Sold most back already, waiting to sell the rest back today and will try again.
---
I enjoyed this thoroughly.
---
Well, buddy, have I news for you. 
---
Go look at "The Invader"
---
You must work for Bethesda
---
I want an atomic shop system similar to destiny 2's eververse. Consistently adding new content like guns and such for free to earn by doing quests/events, and having the higher tier items that are cosmetic locked behind eververse.
---
Yeah, they are pretty strict when it comes to this. Guess they don't want mixes
---
but the scrap kit should be a regurlar item then, like stimpaks...
---
It's all testing the waters. They will continue to push while they believe they can get away with it. They already have a weapon for sale in the atom shop. It will continue to get worse unless a stand is taken.
---
Ahhh ok. Good luck üëçüèΩ
---
Exactly. And alot of people complain about the atom shop but get the items also. If you don't like the atom shop, avoid it. Bethesda will see that as well. But if you're going to complain about the atom shop and still buy items, then just don't complain. The big thing everyone always says is just don't support the games microtransactions and they will go away, yet people keep supporting them. Even if the currency is free to earn
---
First you gotta turn it sideways üòè
---
Just 1 typo, you missed a space in community requested in the private servers section
---
I feel like this is sexual, now I'm really against you. Maybe.
---
There was a time I needed quite a bit of violet ; calibrated shocks for 4 sets of PA.  10 stable per pair x 10 raw to make 1 stable, so 100 raw per set...400 raw total, plus the other necessary mats....
---
But now that I have gathered enough to make what I wanted, not as big of a deal to rush to a nuke zone.
---
You did? Where do I complain?
---
I think what they're getting at is if you can up the legendary rate or resource rate, you can flood the public server market. You up the exp rate and you grind new characters to 50 in hours. Not worried about what you can change on private servers, but what you could bring over from them.
---
r/brandnewsentence
---
I bet you say pogchamp out loud unironically.
---
I'm asking you to post them.
---
Exactly. It's the point no one wants to look at, because it is a distance away, but it's something we really need to think about and all. Even if Bethesda says it'll be a 3 year game. So did black ops 4 and it's already dead. They need to tighten up the cycle or it's going to fall. The reasoning I see them adding these microtransactions is their stockholders. I was watching a video on this, and they explained it basically as a stock holder wants to see money constantly coming in, not big transactions here and there. They want it constantly rolling it so they can throw more money to the stock and keep the ball rolling but if that starts to drop, they aren't going to invest money anymore.
---
This man speaks truth.
---
At least -someone- is getting something nice...good on ya! 
---
\*weeps in third Exterminator prefix in a row\*
---
Ive never seen it in the ATOM store, so Ive never had the opportunity to read the description
---
 I can't really remember where I did it. I think it was through there website. Could have just been customer service chat or something along the lines of that.
---
Hahaha thanks. I was pretty surprised
---
Agreed, please bring this back.
---
 [Bethesda Support](https://help.bethesda.net/app/account/overview)
---
Or Bethesda just needs to fix that damned bug. It's ridiculous, the number of people I haven't been able to friend because one or both of us was bugged.
---
That's pretty cool. In my head I was thinking of a brochure as one of those pamphlets you get at a rest stop or something with local attractions and that this was a brochure that was sent out of Appalachia by cargo bot and air dropped to get people to come back.
---
I'm very worried private servers are going to fracture the community even further and make a mess of things. Player counts are already low, and this game is legitimately not fun without people. Half of what I do is hop around to other player camps since events basically don't exist anymore, which is previously what I spent most of my time doing, so I'm a bit nervous about private servers siphoning off more of the player base. 
---
Then again... I can't imagine Wastelanders would be playable without them, so if I want to enjoy that content I may just not have a choice.
---
Gonna test this out
---
Why not? You think they're gonna support a game that's not bring in money? That's like saying give me free nuggets McDonald's, you have money.
---
Finally someone recognizes that
---
It's from Adventure Time, not a lot of people remember the reference. So it's cool, not sexual at all lol. Thought about changing my IGN to Pooping_Figs though
---
As I stated, nothing comes over. Rank, gear etc...But remember I‚Äôm solely basing what I‚Äôm saying from my experience with other games that utilize public/private servers, Bethesda may not follow that and that would be absolutely stupid on their part.
---
I'd have to disagree with your basic premise that we're the reason behind this.
---
If someone takes a shit in a closed room and puts a bit of bread in it, and others eat the shit because there's nowhere else to go and nothing else to eat, the person who took the shit before they stuck the bread in is still at fault. xD
---
In other words, if the baseline game hadn't been released in a shallow and janky state, and the devs regularly updated the in-game reward tables, we wouldn't have this problem. Whales could be whales and the majority of population who aren't whales could continue having fun with a really great base game experience (one they paid for BTW, let's not forget this isn't a F2P game). 
---
But instead, the base game one year later is lacking, and the rewards in particular have barely improved or increased. So of course when the devs release a beepbort robot everyone wants one. They've been starving us for this type of thing for months.  
---
I don't think it's right to forgive Bethesda for creating the bad baseline situation by pointing out that players are participating the only way they can (if they want to see new stuff). If I didn't get stuff from the Atom Shop I'd have had next to NOTHING to look forward to these last 7-8 months. &gt;.&lt;
---
Progress from private to public is never going to happen.
---
It was done so you can't max out your damage perks by level 10.
---
Thanks everyone for the input! I just bought a refined .50 plan at the Watoga train station and applied it. I'm a casual gamer so I rely on you all for sometimes simple things. This community is great!
---
I feel like "polymorphs" (that's ESO lingo not mine) would sell well on the atom shop. You could look like anything for a short while! Ghoul, Super Mutant, Mole Miner... Assaultron üòè
---
&gt;Looking to start an argument
---
No you're not.
---
You aren't going to be able to move chars from private to public, obviously.  Especially if you can mod the servers.
---
I dont wanna burst your bubble but im 80% sure you can only build 1 per camp, but yeah the trick is to put a flame trap pointing at the base and you can set it off whenever you want to
---
I am excited about loadouts, too.
---
Like [this](https://youtu.be/iSKmUe0rKhs)?
---
I didn't want to Shell out 1400 atoms for that one but it's really cool
---
Thanks much for the info
---
Nah fuck it, there is no excuse for not having it implemented months ago, given how easy it was for a modder to add it. (Same for text chat btw.)  
---
Given that they've also just announced they're delaying just about everything (except atom store monetization!) I'd have to say no. No I am not excited.
---
I agree. The only problem is that the updates they provide are generally not very good. They're either unstable, shallow, or just plain boring in some way. So imagine if they were charging us a sub or DLC for that kind of nonsense? The game would have probably died months ago.
---
So basically you're right, and that's the way it should be done, but it can only succeed if the content updates are quite good.
---
Sure. There are lots of ways it could work better.
---
Have you played with mods on Skyrim? If you turn off a mod on Skyrim and then play it tells you that content is not available. I am betting it will be more like that. You can use your same character but if you go back to adventure, then the modded stuff doesn‚Äôt come with you.
---
Yeah it's dumb, like most of the ideas this dumb team has had for game.
---
Swing speed is good, damage reflect is better, but at any rate best of luck selling it. Someone will like it.
---
Quad is also amazing on auto railways.
---
Turn off for you.  A fresh start isn't a bad gig for a lot of people.  I enjoy it.
---
How are you going to reverse leveling on modded servers that boost xp gain by 500%, etc.?
---
You MIGHT be able to copy your char to a private server IF the private server owner allows it - but that is a BIG MAYBE.  You will definitely NOT be able to take that version of the character back to public.
---
Been pvp'ing perfectly fine here
---
An ammo converter added any way could ruin the trade economy, since it would be bethesda that decides what ammo converts to an amount of another
---
wish i could say the same, i always get so many bugs. Yesterday was the worst
---
They do this in ESO, if I remember correctly (haven't played in a while), so it would be really nice if they also did this in FO76. I would Nuka Cola Quantum color scheme the shit out of everything I can.
---
I dont want hiv in my blood handprints....
---
The bloodied tambo is something else entirely. Bloodied anything is something else entirely, once you're all bloody.
---
Lol this is what most people believe anyway.
---
Was gonna come back once private servers opened up, but they turned out to be pay only, thought it would be like every other game that lets you host your own game but oh well...maybe next year something will make me open the game...I'll be playing The Outer World's.
---
Good luck to everyone who sticks with it.
---
Great looking brochure,  I like the color usage especially and overly positive wording.  I used to work finish bindery in a medium sized print shop and we did a lot of things like this.  I have a couple of suggestions that will give you a more consistent end product.
---
* The "The" in the Wastelanders, the page numbers, and vault boy are too close to the edge.  Depending on how it is being cut out its press sheet those could get clipped.  
---
* Reconsider having the yellow "Wastelanders" either stop short of the fold or go past it on the the next page.  When these are being folded the most important part will be if the edges line up and that means the center of the image may not actually be where the fold is.
---
* This is more of a layout thing, but you may want to consider moving your "2" page number.  Having one page number on the outside edge and one in the middle looks a little weird in practice, and if this was a booklet the inside page number is often hard to see since it is so close to the fold.
---
Something a lot of designers forget is how the product is actually made.  Doing things one-off might look great, but making a few thousand is a different story.
---
I think it was bound to happen. We usually get crap a half off sale means we get double the chances for crap. I got mostly single action revolvers.
---
Thanks! This is my first draft and I‚Äôll definitely consider and change these on my final one
---
I don't use mods that much as I like the base game experience more than I do playing with mods enabled. Also fallout 4 save got corrupt because of a mod so I haven't touched them since.
---
That could work I guess but it could break your character if they don't implement the removal of modded items properly.
---
Where did you buy this from?
---
They just need to fix the "public" events so that tagging isn't necessary.  Its a dumb restriction honestly, poor design.
---
Same with not getting XP when your friend one shots a mob, despite  being on the same team and being right next to each other.
---
I agree, but am afraid that is hardly on their priority list... Private servers launch and Atom shop items are where it's at atm.
---
Same boat. I've been crafting, modding and selling Power Armor, and crafting and selling Ammo. Gathering materials &amp; Flux keeps me busy! Also playing with different types of weapons with different mods, Priming them etc. Pretty fun!
---
Why do people think switching servers has any impact?
---
We all know a fact that live service won't last foever.... so I still really hope there will be an offline mode available in the near future.
---
I know, I was thinking that too. Its a little dissapointing
---
I‚Äôm very interested in keeping my carbon, strontium, and cesium footprints down.  Will this help in that regard?  I‚Äôm not so concerned about thorium.
---
Clearly you haven't seen some of the stuff you can do with the workshop. I myself have built entire concrete foundation bunkers around resource nodes doesn't matter if AI attack when they can't actually damage it. Also the enemies attacking workshops is just another thing to farm.
---
I have a bloodied one. Can't remember if I got it from her or from a legendary though.
---
The Enclave science wing sells them. I think you can get them for 17.5k caps with the right barter perks. Some players sell them if they have leftovers from when the SBQ used to drop them as rewards.
---
For Minecraft I was running a 4690K @4.5Ghz, there were three servers in total since the server is entirely single-threaded you can specify individual cores to each process and leave the first thread open for system tasks.
---
RAM speed is mostly a non-issue in my experience though I haven't seen true benchmarks between higher and lower speeds of memory, mine was running at 1866 just fine. How much is enough depends on your player count and how heavily modded the server is but I'm allocating 16GB per which is relatively overkill.
---
Having an SSD helps a bit for chunks reloading but it's still a largely CPU-bound game. The faster your single-core performance the faster the server is going to run.
---
If you happened to be hosting 1.13, or early 1.14 patches of the game they are pretty notorious for having really awful server performance no matter what you throw at them. 1.14.4 has partially fixed that but beforehand there were hitches and hiccups in TPS constantly on even the best hardware.
---
I heard there was an argument going on up in here, Im here to tell ya that fridge is the greatest fridge ever put in the atom shop, even though it doesnt keep food longer than what I can by keeping it on  me. There I said it. 
---
What the heck is a flooping? 
---
and oh yeah your uncles mother
---
Make it auto. The recoil is crazy on these, so they‚Äôre best used in vats.
---
Ohhhh I do remember that, so sad the show ended. That and regular show was awesome. Still dont like you though. Idk why stop asking.
---
It's kind of like how google wants you to buy games that you can only play on their subscription streaming service, which would be like if you had to perpetually pay a fee to play the games you own on your computer or playstation.
---
I hate sloths. And go pee if it's that bad.
---
As did I.
---
The fridge sucks harder than your grandma on that old VHS I have.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love that I can name them - I just want to be able to visually have my armor above or below my custom clothing. For instance, I have a female character. I put her in a dress for fun. But she has a backpack I can never hide. Likewise, I want to see her armor because I want her dress to have a bit of a Mad Max feel. So, why can‚Äôt I set backpack to HIDDEN and armor to SHOWN?
---
I'm on Xbox and it has been happening recently.
---
i wish, i think i have found one since it came out. might do some hunting over the weekend.
---
Yikes
---
I can't agree with this enough. I don't even look at the skins section anymore. They never have a skin for anything I use for weapons, and I just throw on an outfit so no one can see my mix'n'match armor. So I gave it up. Five million combat knife skins, but I gave up when I had checked back repeatedly and there was no shotgun love. Meanwhile, the scrap kits get featured and I shake my head.
---
Bethesda, you and Zenimax were able to figure out dye in ESO. Figure your shit out and get back to us.
---
I had a similar experience: 100% trash across three characters as long as I chose three-star items. I switched to two-stars when I got down to 200 scrip and got a few useful items, though not necessarily useful to *that* character.
---
Exact opposite of the advice I would give :)
---
Not sure why someone downvoted you but this 100%, provided it's something more fun than 'boil water at night whilst naked'.
---
Maybe your frail old lady body is more apt to turn to dust and ooze than everyone else.
---
Exactly what I was thinking.  I think Jay's assessment is correct.  But if they did allow moving from private / public and let you manipulate values on private, it would nuke the player economy from orbit.
---
Thats a possibility
---
You think it would be good until someone needs black titanium.
---
The do stuff in formal clothing is bugged too
---
wow. thats a lot.  thanks
---
That's kinda like The Fixer then innit? Uses the same mods, looks similar, but with a different coat of paint. Do you think the fixer is a skin?
---
Lol
---
Do you know, that was one of my first thouht, as well. The noises, though... I don't think I could do it, not matter HOW much I wanted crabs...

You can rig flamethrowers to a button then have them damage and set the rocket off.
---
I started off with ten 3\* rolls and about the 4th roll I got an AAFFR+per tesla followed by a B10vats 50MG and AAE+agl pump shotgun and then back to junk, then I switched to 2\* rolls and got a B10 mingun and B10 50 MG within 5 rolls. Then I stopped because I was too overweight.
---
Then later after a few sales and stashing a few missile launchers in suitcases I went vendor hopping and found a VE+AGL railway rifle for 1K caps and a bloodied critical/critical missile launcher (probably the only worthwhile one) for 500 caps at the same vendor.
---
So you can get some decent stuff as long as you aren't looking for one exact thing and considering everything else crap. Out of all the stuff I got I either already had better ones or they didn't fit my builds though. I will probably keep the tesla because it's the first good tesla I've had though. Vendor hopping for other people's discards was good though because I always wanted a VE railway rifle.
---
Looked through and didn't see anything so I'll ask. What of the legendaries for everyone at events so we don't have to worry about 1-shotters? Is that going to be with this next patch or are we going to have to wait for later? 
---
Also, with wastelanders, and I might be the minority on this, I think it should have been released over time and not just "Bam! Everyone is back and the world is now fully populated." That doesn't happen. People would slowly return.
---
VHS? Your beta max finally wore out?
---
Stop upvoting me you salty boyes. I'm a Raider. I'm only allowed down votes. Go back to Adventure Mode!
---
Yes, please.
---
Sadly yes.
---
It's got a pretty nuts firing rate with auto receiver. Only useful in vats though because the muzzle climbs like a rocket.
---
Yes, yesterday they said next week for private servers with modding to it coming in the future.
---
By a weird coincidence, while doing Queen of the Hunt this morning, I had two sheepsquatches in the site south of the power plant. But the game only cared about the yaoguai they were fighting.

My great grandma was on the Beta, Woot!  oh yeah, My mother!

fuck your fridge man! who teh fuck do you think you are!!! you want a piece!? bud i'll fuch u up.
---
unless you dont like the fridge... in which case.
---
Bro!!!! the fridge is dank memes. get fucked soyboi!!!!
---
I think the worst problem (besides the game breaking bugs) is the lack of endgame. It's the lvl 200 guys that keep this game going, not the guys who play just once every month. The only thing to do in this game is getting better equipment for the sake of having better equipment. Survival doesn't even exist anymore so pvp isn't even a real thing anymore. Without the trading system i would've stopped playing a long time ago. They really need to add challenging bossfights to the game otherwise this game'm will die soon
---
Spent about a thousand last night and the best thing I got was a Pipe Gun with Furious and the +10% while aiming thing. Just a lot of trash.
---
Maybe still try restting your modem? Sometimes if it runs for too long it creates IP conflicts.
---
Meet me at the flatwoods station, we will settle this once and for all. I'll destroy your base with the legendary cane I got from the sale.
---
Making perks apply would make such a huge difference
---
We have bricks in the game?
---
Took a 2 month break from 76 came back to see what's new saw someone in a power armor skin unfamiliar to me. (Heqvy power armor user btw) it was liberty prime with the voice overs....I want that to come back....
---
I do have more than one character.  I have three.  My main character since day one.  I have a mule for trading and another character to play with lower level peeps.  I think a lot of people are assuming way too much from private servers too fast.  We have received one new song for the radio in almost a year and Bethesda is going to grant all sorts of control for the manager of the private server.  Anyway it's a win/win for me.  Either I can use my character across servers, and if not, I'm not interested and save $ and stick to public game.
---
So absurd this doesn't have legendary variants. Even the Rolling Pin has legendaries.
---
What‚Äôs a magazine?
---
bruh i'll straight flatten you at flatwoods, im throwing seven different kinds of smoke!!!!!
---
My  3 Broadsiders from the sale are better than your cane even in flatwoods
---
Buy a railway rifle plan and start crafting and scrapping them to unlock mods. You want to put the long barrel on, auto receiver, dot sight (whatever it's called, because it reduces VATS ap cost), and recoil reduction stock. All of those are unlocked via scrapping.
---
As far as perks go AFAIK the railway uses commando for auto receiver and rifleman for semi auto. You use the same perk builds that a handmade would use, but if you do a commando build you also want to concentrate on VATS AP usage/refresh rate because an auto railway rifle is pretty much 100% vats reliant if you want to hit anything.
---
Not excited. More bugs than excitement here
---
I think different leveled versions would be good, because if you added the buffs you suggest, the only thing any level 20 would use would be the chainsaw. Other than that, great suggestions and spitball ideas!
---
And what about a chat box. That should have been in the game long ago. It‚Äôs a basic feature of all MMO style games
---
I'm wondering if this is how there were 100+ Robco keycards on a corpse plus around 50 passwords in the cabinet nearby. And of course you can't drop keycards, so now I inadvertently have around 50 of those fuckers in my inventory. üòí
---
Check your stored tab
---
damn man who pooped in your Sugar Bombs cereal this morning?
---
I‚Äôve gotten grafton monster and snallygaster as well
---
Dang. Maybe you should have switched servers halfway through
---
Its the same with uranium fever
---
I have been being disconnected as well! 3 times in an hour!
---
I have 30 over items of 3*, each is either 24 or 40 scrips. So how can 150 be enuff? Seriously
---
ahhhhh THIS guy is my hero
---
thanks for the idea, i hope the Red Rocket sign comes back someday so i can try this out!
---
You caught me üôÑ
---
It will stay on the server you left it on. If it shows up on your server when you log out and log back in, you're still on the same server.
---
If it‚Äôs possible the process is probably similar to those underground camps people have been building. Only serous issue I can think of is trying to interact with CAMP items like beds, instruments, and even workbenches while underwater. Before you start going in all maybe try placing just a foundation with one of the items mentioned above to see if it still works in water.
---
YES!!! muahahahahha its awesome!
---
I had nothing but god rolls yesterday.  For real I‚Äôm expecting 30k caps on multiple characters quick.  I‚Äôm a lucky one I suppose.
---
Haha! Yeah right, I'll swat those cannonballs out of the air.
---
Yes, the Chinese government gave them that privilege. By 2047 the deal ends and China and Hong Kong won't have two systems. By 2050 China will become a democracy. The Chinese communist party plans ahead.
---
Or just get rid of the completely mongo tagging system. God forbid somebody nearby doesnt get loot because he didnt do 2200 damage in 1 shot.
---
And I like the kid in the fridge next to the pudding. Fallout 4 üòÇ
---
The only way they MIGHT allow private/public cross over is if the private server has zero changes and is just a default server; but even that is unlikely to happen.  You could easily exploit it by hosting a private server with no one else on it, and just capture a bunch of workshops and enjoy free, unhindered resources for however long you wanted.  Etc.
---
This is the problem with people jumping in to different threads on conversations lol. I had already explained the backpack thing to the other guy and was confused.
---
I didn't go through all of the comments, so I might be repeating them, but here it is, anyway.
---
The atom shop has become increasingly lackluster. At about the time they started bringing in the kits, the stopped bringing in anything I really wanted. I'd like to know who at Bethesda is so fixated on tires. They need to move to a team that deals with racing games. Or Rage. Or literally anything with actual moving vehicles. That's where the tires belong. And while we all love the raider and Free States stuff, where all all the other factions?
---
I don't do a lot of atom grinding. I don't want to spend my game time (which is supposed to be fun) taking pictures of a wendigo in a blast zone being killed by a player in a clown suit... Or naked. What the hell? A lot of us play alone, Bethesda. Maybe you missed that somehow? It's not like there's a lone wandered perk, or anything.
---
Am I bitter and ranting? Perhaps. But given how often I see people complain about this stuff on here, I don't think I'm alone. I don't know who these players are that they're catering to, but it's not anyone I know.
---
No... because the fixer has a specific unique effect.... increased sneak.
---
Does that really make a difference? Doesn't seem like it should.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about this, and it‚Äôs pretty much like this: Bethesda offers you either a turd sandwich or a cracker. When you kind of half-assed choose the cracker, Bethesda says ‚Äúthe people have spoken! They want crackers!‚Äù
---
Yeah I have been told by a PVP friend that he used Aqua boy to make a base in one of the lakes and he used it to ambush people, told me he could use workbenches under water, but I don't know him that well so yeah, gonna experiment before I go all in and move. I love the idea of an an aqua man palace that I can swim around and no one will know about my secret under water base.
---
I get its unfair and you feel cheated out of drops but you have to put yourself in their shoes as well most of them have invested a lot of time in gearing up and going through a lot of time to go through hit and misses to get the specific gear they have why shouldn't they be able to use them. i know its not fair but why instead of complaining do you gear up and be better and kill the enemies before them. i personally only shoot once with my gun as i do considerable damage and give everyone a shot but sometimes i kill everything because a lot of lower levels act like dicks and try to crowd or block areas and then i just say F it and kill everything.
---
It is a bit annoying. Especially since half the arm mods for PA are for unarmed. And a power fist should in theory have been designed to work with power armor.
---
I dont like that at all. It's not funny he died horribly.
---
üëçüèºüëçüèº, so don‚Äôt do that to transfer items!?!? And no, I‚Äôm not a complete moron...I‚Äôd never try something like that
---
The only differences I'm expecting to see between private servers and what we have now is that private playerbases will be invite-only and paid-mods will be available as plugins. 
---
Local hosting for singleplayer or co-op? Administrator control? Access to all existing in-game assets? No way Bethesda will allow anything like that.
---
Let‚Äôs drop some nukes
---
or the Jilted Radroach groom
---
Rifleman Perks I believe. I've got a TSE, Primed that mother lover and it's stupidly good! Great sniping weapon. I don't use Vats perks though, so potentially I could make it even more of a beast!
---
Its a Rifle, It's slow and need charging. I would recomend buying 1 for 450caps from the Bunker and play around first
---
He might have died but he was still "fresh" somebody elses mom
---
Oh and yes, it's used in print too.
---
Hermit crabs constantly grow as they age, and find new shells.
---
School bus + hermit crab = new event.
---
Protect the mega hermit crab as it migrates into a new shell. Maybe it needs high levels of radiation to exit the old one, say something like a nuke launch or a constant barrage of fat man or gamma gun dosing to survive the transition?
---
Sounds fun to me. I typically avoid killing hermit crabs in the game. I had two through most of my childhood, so I just leave them be if possible.
---
Can you link a nukeanddragon build please. It's 2am and I'm stuck at work so I'm not really interested in reading much.
---
Reemus, the only I like is the journey of reemus. So I dont like you.
---
Your 2nd cousin
---
It seems like it could. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try lol
---
Yep, I was there too... Some of us saw this coming.
---
I wish it wasn't the case
---
Yes, i don't like going because it is such a cluster. Ever since it was put on public event and everyone is notified at least once there is a legendary that doesn't get to morph or they kill it before everyone gets to tag.
---
Man the first time I saw a hermit crab I was like WTF it keeps targeting that bus over there where is the crab then it dawned on me and I saw it move and then I died of laughter (and also of head trauma)
---
This, IIRC you are allowed a maxium of 8 total, you might have some stored in blue prints
---
There's honestly no reason for them not to. Brass knuckles might scale funny, but since there's already a power armor punching animation all they really need to do is make the weapons scale up a bit when using them in power armor. The choice to make them unusable back in FO4 was just strange, and for a team that should know what they're doing, a bit lazy.
---
So you are saying then, if I am clear in this. That the ONLY thing that differentiates a paint job, from an entirely seperate craftable in your opinion, is a stat change. Not that it is applied as paint, but that the stats are different? Because in that case I have some bad news for you. The Probe said (Baton) next to it, not (Combat Knife) and those two items have different stats.
---
I have some doubt about the actual health sbq has, usually i deal 111 damage per shot, 11 shot/second (primed B25 .50), that is around 1221 damage per second, and his health bar moves down a bit slow than i expected.
---
Post makes to much sense for Bethesda.
---
The only events that really work when everyone's piling in are those with tough enemies like scorched earth, encrypted or project paradise. With those it feels great having a load of people work together to take something down.
---
Events with one easily killable boss that everyone elbows each other out of the way to get to are awful now. I avoid them completely now, which is sad because some are lots of fun.
---
They do not have different stats
---
Yeah, what they should have done is that when you join the event and someone kills a legendary in that event, everyone should be able to look since its supposed to be a group event
---
Nuka Cola themed objects are cool, but I hope they'll someday do a Nuka Cola or more generally pre war companies themed update that adds stuff like all the Nuka Cola versions and recipes from Nuka World, the Mixer station, the plant becomes a workshop and perhaps more pre war companies lore like a Med Tek building with a chems workshops, or a smugglers' hideout with chems and alchool workshop, etc.
---
Plus I want the Nuka Cola lamp in that one dude's room!
---
While I see what you are saying, I think this will actually help the game and have little effect on the current public server population. I, myself, only play solo. Grouping is too much of a chore and I hate talking on a mic or listening to others in this environment. I play Fallout for the adventure, exploration and lore so hearing others talk, their background music or commotion going on in their house, or even people just being goofy breaks the immersion for me. I am sure there are many others like me who play for the same reason,
---
Private servers give the single player community a place to play Fallout the way we love to play Fallout while those that enjoy the multiplayer experience can still do so. I will pop back and forth most likely, but so far there is little I cannot do alone and I prefer it that way. I may be wrong, but that is my theory.
---
Some of us buy things because we know the company needs to make money to keep the servers running, not because we need to.
---
The money going to them isn't the issue, it is what they have chosen to do that is.
---
I dont like me either, But I come from a long line of reemus so I have to. You should take that journey... off a short pier
---
Good luck, love the idea. Reminds me of when I used to play Minecraft with my friends, always wanted to make an underwater house but was never able to make it fully submerged without water getting in somehow, lol.
---
Well I definitely agree with you on that. I've spent a little here and there because I have been enjoying the game and I do want to support it. I just mean that anyone who isn't happy with it isn't required to spend money. Some people are making it out like this is a subscription based game or that anything is locked behind a pay wall or something. They aren't forcing anyone to spend money other than buying the game.
---
Ya. Bethesda used to be the exception to the rule, because they are a private company and aren't beholden to share holders. Unfortunately a large investment firm dumped a lot of money into them, and now they are beholden to that firm, and that firms expectations of profit.
---
Oh damn! Wow that good to know. Like I said I don‚Äôt pvp unless someone has a bounty (trying to complete that challenge!) or they keep hitting me for no reason.
---
It was a bug when it was labeled like a baton...
---
I misread what you wrote when I said they had the same stats. 
---
The invader is a combat knife... uses combat knife mods... and now is correctly labeled as a combat knife in the store... everyone says it should be a baton.... but it is a combat knife.
---
yea
---
Edit: Can we stack foundations?
---
What's the point? When I played most of the game felt like single player since I saw other players so rarely.
---
But its still disingenuous to promise that the atom shop will be one thing and then not follow through on that promise while implying this is what we asked for. Is it toxic to be upset that we were lied to?
---
The Fridge, the salvage bot, the kits, these are all small things, but they're exclusively there to push the envelope. First we add salvage kits, small inoffensive surely, then they add the fridge and robot, slightly worse but still tiny, who cares right?
---
All I'm saying when money hits the table things change, mods historically have been one of the biggest saving graces of any buggy Bethesda crap-fest, but when mods could hurt profit margins, investors complain. Sure the developers might think mods are great, but that matters less and less when money is standing next to them.
---
Look at GTA 5 for example, the single player was amazing, but wheres the single player DLC? Eaten by shark cards, why waste time producing some huge expensive high quality product when you can sell a rocket bike for like 20 bucks. The fucking Vault 76 staircase cost as much as the entire Vault-Tec Workshop dlc, they didn't even do anything to it, its just a set of fucking stairs that they already had laying around.  
---
Slap always online on something, making modding it next to impossible and bam you don't even have to try, sell them the same buggy shit for twice the value.
---
The store they added for Fo4 was garbage but it pushed the envelope, fo76 was even worse and it's still pushing the envelope, every game the produce from now on will guarantee have some shitty more intrusive store taking away from what should have been a real game.
---
Oh god. How many ARE there. Unless it was an Atom challenge this week? lol
---
I told you once!
---
No you didn‚Äôt. 
---
Yes I did. 
---
When?
---
Just now. 
---
No you didn‚Äôt 
---
I did
---
Didn‚Äôt
---
You did not. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry is this a 5 minute argument or a full half hour?
---
Lets face it, they didn't delay it for quality reasons, they are not releasing it because it has to be worse than any of the other not ready patches they have pushed on this game.
---
They have shown us time and time again they are  very willing to put content out before it is ready, they would have done the same with wastelanders if it was remotely close to ready.
---
Can‚Äôt you trade them in for like 10 less then they cost
---
If they are going to use an antisocial play style they need to play alone. Doing all that damage it shouldn't be an issue.
---
Go into the atomic shop right now. It clearly says ‚Äúcombat knife‚Äù next to it.
---
Oh, yes, I see, I see. That makes sense, just like how you mistook me for someone else earlier and have mistook weapons being sold in the atomic shop for skins. It's all coming together now.
---
Have you ever seen a pink vault suit in fallout lore?
---
That's true, but going based on his comment, just because people might not have the best gear doesn't mean they're wrong.
---
yeah, fo76 is actually of the more generous online service game out there. despite what the fanbase thinks
---
I don‚Äôt know why you need to be a jerk. I am multi tasking right now. The invader is labeled as a combat knife... which is why it uses combat knife mods...
---
The lesser of two evils is obviously to allow friendly group play to feel good with out feeling like you have to hold back so everyone can get a piece.
---
One of my biggest gripes in this game is that playing with my friend actually feels worse for leveling because we're constantly cutting into eachothers loot/xp gain from killing mobs.
---
The word has but it sounded like maybe it wasn‚Äôt used as a print term. I‚Äôm in web development.
---
Stop that! That post was entirely to long. Unlike your manhood.
---
Idk about others, but the last the times I went into a silo, my game crashed halfway through. Just a waste of time and ammo for me, lately.
---
Dude I want to see a behemoth size hermit crab that is invincible just wandering around Appalachia showing the world what is up.
---
Yes you just have to put yourself in the fridge's inventory.
---
Why doesn't everyone just use a shitty weapon at these events?  I always use one of my worst weapons and shot slowly so everyone gets a shot.
---
I totally agree. I was just being snarky based on a few comments I‚Äôve seen on here recently about people legit thinking you need to buy repair kits to fix your gear!
---
That is what I mean when i said  they MIGHT let you copy a char to a private server, if the private server owner allows it, but any progression you make on that copy wouldn't transfer back to public.
---
Omg yassss this needs to happen. This would allow the game to be explored underground. This game will be the next Skyrim but Fallout style. I have high hopes for Wastelanders when it releases next year.
---
Now that's p2w people.
---
I just laughed like an idiot. Your fault. Are raiders allowed to be entertaining?
---
I dont know, every time I go out there it takes 3 hrs. If I dont go its done in 2 mins, Wait Im starting to see a pattern. 
---
Im all in a Flinging Fridges, at anyone. Esp if they argue with me in this thread
---
its important to use the rifleman perks instead of commando(wich you would assume)
---
so if its lead lined it would protect you from the radiation but not the heat you would cook init and prob melt with it.
---
sounds like you've cleared the game then. next step is usually rerolling character
---
/s, just to be clear ;)
---
All this "inspired" building will only lead to more restrictions :/
---
I wholeheartedly support this.
---
But I don't know if I could survive the week long tsunami of impotent rage from the bush wookies in here if BGS ever actually gets around to it.
---
Palowski. Nuclear protection on a budget!
---
It would be all of 5 mins of work to re-purpose one from another weapon too.
---
Or just an hour or so for one person to make one from scratch.
---
Or at least raise the cap for sale events
---
I sold 1400 caps worth of 3\* legendaries yesterday because I was overweight and my stash reached its limit.
---
Im sure the raider bot at Pleasant Valley was really  happy with all the reduced fall damage armors I gave him.
---
Players were not.
---
As a finish installer , thank you , wish more artist considered those points.
---
Intel: gunsmith5 and powerpatcher2 only need to be loaded when you are actively using them.  carrying them when adventuring is as waste of points.  If you think you'll get into heavy weapons, Stablized may be a better use for some of those 7 points, as will batteries included.
---
You cant move the points to another column until you hit L50 - so I would suggest unequip those two and use something else when you are out and around.  In lower levels, I found the 3 hacker perks to be quite helpful - (I've since switched to lockpick3 and only load hacker when I need it)
---
Luck: consider bloody mess. Once you start getting mutations, starched genes and class freak.
---
Perception: Green thumb - Once you start doing nuke zones, green thumb doubles flux.  
---
Agility: I pretty much live in PA - I used white knight early, but eventually dumped it for Actionboy/girl3 for the AP regen.
---
Once you obtain the perks to overrepair weapons and armor, any perks for slower breakage/instant repair may not matter as much.
---
People have been having issues with turrets placed on top of things, if an enemy breaks it they can disappear and not come back when you fix your Camp. I don‚Äôt think anyone has figured out a way to get them back out of your budget :( 
---
If you place them down on a mat or something they will always come back when you fix them but that doesn‚Äôt help you right now. I hope someone has some more answers for you!
---
&gt; What are we arguing about in its simplest form
---
False advertising. You don't seem to understand that or you are intentionally muddying the point.
---
They promised (several times, not just once) that the atom shop would be purely cosmetic. Some people bought the game because of that. I heavily pay attention to post game content plans when I purchase something. I had no intention of buying division 2 after division 1 until they revealed that there would be no paid dlc. I bought this because they specifically said the atom shop would be just cosmetics.
---
I would expect more global challenges as filler as well.
---
Usually I'm against name drops, but yeah people should be warned and know about this scumbag.
---
I would like if it any unused accumulated.  That way I did not have to log in every day just to sell some script (Caps working this way would also be nice).    
---
Even if they just added 10 more than at least I could see 4 x 3\* weapons and be done for the day.
---
Hi you should always use a courier or a middle man for any high end trade never trade god tier weapons to some random biggest mistake you can make.
---
Lol couldn't have said it better myself.
---
As a general rule if they message you ingame instead of on the other trading sub here it‚Äôs 90% a scam
---
Curious, how did he scam you exactly?  He tell you to drop the weapon on the floor?  Told you to price it to 0 and then just take it and run?  etc.  But thanks for letting us know, I'm going to block that GT on XBL when I get home.  What a douche, sorry that happened to you.
---
I had a TSE and it was a good mid tier weapon just got rid of it because I finally got a TSE AA handmade. Which is definitely an upgrade because of ease of firing and not having to charge it and the ammo is lighter. Still waiting for my end weapon a BE FFR  handmade or fixer. Someday üòè
---
I asked the fellow near Jean Sky-diving. He was silent on the matter.
---
Yeah figured right after they blocked me that was probably the case.
---
I mean you honeslty gotta say, when has this game ever worked 100% lol
---
Ive seen a lot the pass few days.
---
If I say this is the best thread I've read all week, do we have to argue about it? We can get a full "uh huh" "nu-uh" thing going on, I suppose.
---
They make wonderful sniper rifles, especially with an instigating or bloody effect, but they are too slow to be of much use outside that niche. Also, a black powder rifle does even more damage, though you can't put a scope on a black powder.
---
Change the typeface. The one chosen doesn‚Äôt work with the retro future aesthetic of fallout. Fallout branding always uses futura. This will help be on brand
---
I'm Fallput 4 when you uninstall a mod, a lot of them will crash the game. They modify things in the game's script, and once that is in a save file there is no way to back it out. 
---
FO76 is all saved server side, so I really feel like mods aren't ever going to be a thing. Maybe Atom Shop content. 
---
I doubt private servers are going to be anything other than just a server where you control who gets to enter.
---
You're cherry picking and ignoring the rest. That was a sentence out of a giant post. I'm not typing that again. Do what you like.
---
I mean... yeah. If the price isn't right, I won't pay for it.
---
lol i want to see this! are u on xbox?
---
Thanks
---
He told me to trade the gun to him first and he'd trade me insurance items while he hopped over to a mule to trade me the items we discussed earlier. Then after I traded it he blocked me and logged out.
---
But the attacker gets to choose the timing.  So even though you are right that tight quarters helps even the odds, the only chance that the defender has is to build a maze of traps at the workshop, using more junk than you would lose.     So your response is a bit disingenuous...
---
I'm  look for the mayonnaise. Maybe you could grab it for me. Second shelf, right next to the pudding.
---
Haha I actually forgot about that until you mentioned it. Gotta learn the hard way sometimes I guess.
---
Its probably the worst and so are you.
---
what kind and what system?!?
---
I think the best way to start this kind of discussion is by asking only one question.
---
 "Is it the wright place to have an argument?".
---
Case in point just made a discussion in other sub about a Fixer and I‚Äôm getting in game messages 1 minute later ,.... umm no I only deal on reddit was my sole reply
---
Kinda but it can be tricky. Build the top layer and then the bottom layers. Might take a few tries and it might not line up perfectly but it will work. It's easier to do it you do it on an incline
---
I couldn't pronounce hyunae, msd eme mad. So now I'm mad at you.
---
Ran into a group of players last night who did everything in their power to kill the thing before I could get my hits in. I proceeded to to pull out the Furious explosive  Prime .50 Cal I keep just for such occasion and killed legendaries before they even got a look at them. And for most everything else I have my Quad Tesla rifle.
---
By all means people who are phallic in nature, keep going I'll be happy to justly return the favor.
---
Haha wow looks like I upset somebody!
---
intresting fact, the vault suit was blue and yellow because the artist at the time got given a colour palette which included blue and yellow and did not use those colours in anything but the suit which they only did as the producers asked why those colours was not being used.
---
Tell me where pink unicorn wallpaper is in fallout lore?
---
Unless your a creative director for bethsda, dont tell me what is lore and what is not.
---
Yup from Enclave Science wing. I have hard Bargin 1. I think it was 22k.
---
I am! I will post a picture when I get a moment later today. The water feels fine but don‚Äôt forget the radaway and a towel.
---
Yeah I agree. "Should have, could have, would have" sort of situation here. Just put too much trust in the guy. Really it's the kindness of other players that ruined my expectation of this game :P But in all realness I definitely should have been more careful.
---
But u have to be quick, it regenerates health lol
---
Same with me. I just came back after a break and ran into a player with it. I was green with envy....or maybe that was the rads
---
There you go: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7b85d75&amp;d=s00st1sv1s61p00pd2pk2pl2pe0e11e60e80e41e51c72cr0i10ic4ig1ih1id2a70a41s70au2l21lp1l60&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=Power%20armor%20](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=7b85d75&amp;d=s00st1sv1s61p00pd2pk2pl2pe0e11e60e80e41e51c72cr0i10ic4ig1ih1id2a70a41s70au2l21lp1l60&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=Power%20armor%20)
---
I've also edited the post with this link and a link for a build when out of the power armor.
---
We could get an un huh, nu uh going but Scortchbeastbait cant spell them
---
I usually am too. This was enough of a dishonesty for me to warn other from them.
---
Your name is gibberish and you smoke the devil's lettuce.
---
Happens to all of us i myself was scammed once albeit nothing god tier but that lesson still stands to me never trust anyone when trading if they have a problem using a courier youll know then they're sketchy.
---
awesome! for whatever reason i really like what people do with bodies of water and their camps.
---
no, and I dont like scorch
---
Jesus, man. Calm down
---
ps4 also and can make. also please add me and buy or trade me some stuff, I gotta slow walk or nuka-travel till I get my weight down! this sale whooped me!
---
I was looking at the available cards in Perception and was thinking if I went for those 6 points I cold go for Tank killer 3 but I'm not sure where I would use the other 3? Maybe I should redistribute them?
---
Deathclaw island.
---
Yesterday when I heard about Wastlanders delay I just started new game and created new character.
---
Always, always, always use a trusted middleman.
---
Good. Be careful!
---
I have a ton, what's your pan? I'll hook you tonight when I'm on. No charge.
---
I don't get it. The game would be better if everything in the Atom shop was real money only?
---
Yeah, this is how they all are, with very few exceptions. I'd honestly say most are even worse. At least 76 only has two currencies and the endgame crafting stuff is only used for a few items.
---
how is it antisocial because they do more damage than you. Why should everyone conform to make you able to get drops. you sound very antisocial yourself. I get the sense of alot of "not fair" or "ME .. ME ... ME" vibe from you. No one should be forced to play anyway other than the way they want to. if you cant keep up either because your low level or dont have the gear thats on you. You either need more time to gear up or you are  doing something wrong.
---
This is so wholesome. I don't think I've ever seen that either! I would have been pretty excited haha
---
Take an updoot.
---
I see them all the time at Player Vendors for dirt cheap.
---
When trading items like that u gotta be strict with ur buyers. Bring what u asked for to the first meet or no deal.
---
Easy solution is on public events it automatically puts everyone into a team
---
That's gross, there's no hand sanitizer left to clean the items.
---
Preach. A large part of this community has to be made up of people without lives outside of Fallout. The amount of time they sink into this game is absurd. Then they come on here to bitch about lack of content.
---
I think a 300 limit would be fine, but goddamn you had like three days to clear out your stash for this sale...
---
Yeah, he's a known scammer. He's on the blacklist with ten different Reddit names and three or four different gts.
---
Can you place it on the island?
---
No it's antisocial because they don't allow anyone else to get a shot in. I use my worst weapons and shoot slow at most social event so everyone gets a chance. Doing all that damage you shouldn't need our help anyway just do the events alone if you don't want anyone else to get a chance.
---
That‚Äôs partly what I based the suggested numbers on, though I did take creative liberties when considering additional changes so they wouldn‚Äôt be too strong.
---
If I recall at 200% the chainsaw was about 30, drill was 25, buzz blade was in the 30‚Äôs and I can‚Äôt quite remember the ripper but it might‚Äôve been close to the drill.
---
I think that's silly. All that accomplished was preventing people from going and exploring whichever region of the map suited them until they hit level 50+, and made the gameplay feel a lot more linear and less like the Bethesda vibe we're used to. There have been several posts about how people were confused about why they were doing great, and then crossed an imaginary line and suddenly can't kill anything.
---
They really need to borrow more of the mechanics they have in ESO. Enemy difficulty should be determined by whoever initiates combat with the enemy, not whoever happens to be within some imaginary "zone", for example. PvP should require an explicit yes/no decision in adventure, not a tap in mechanic that's easily exploited. We should have a mail system. In game chat. There should be Game Masters that can make a physical presence in the game to actually witness some of the bugs, glitches, and exploits. All content considered to be a "dungeon" or "raid" should be instanced, including events. This way you could run events with your team and not worry about that one asshole showing up and stealing the legendary kill. A group finder for these events. Make it an actual MMO, not just this weird pseudo online game. They've really missed the mark on almost everything.
---
Under the map.  No obstructions or enemy spawns.
---
I don't care about mods, never have. I'm hoping that we will be able to go back and forth from adventure and private. I only want private so my friends and I can do raids as lag free as possible. To go a step further , I feel like players that only want to use it for that reason should be able to group up and play private for free , so long as they are only using it for raids. Other than that I only want to play adventure. My wife on the other hand, has watched me play since launch. And she has said from the beginning, that if there were private servers, she would steal my game. Guess who's losing PlayStation time next week.
---
Private servers are being introduced and mods will follow not to long later
---
i think what is happening is high lvl players are trying to get more kills to fill the event completion bar for Shielded plans and rare jumpsuits. 
---
i don‚Äôt think like this but i imagine their train of thought is why should they sacrifice the good loot pool so lower levels can get a legendary they‚Äôre not going to use anymore in a month or so.
---
People shouldn‚Äôt jump on others for sharing their opinion on this. Yeah, I wasn‚Äôt a supporter of the whole Utility items in the Atomic Shop and I never asked for them either. Does that make them wrong? No. There were, undoubtedly, those that did ask for them and these people most likely make use of them. That is their choice. I‚Äôve always believed in catering for as many different people as possible in games, even with things that aren‚Äôt to my taste. Things I want, I buy and things that I don‚Äôt want, I don‚Äôt buy. It‚Äôs that simple. 
---
It was annoying to see Bethesda go back on their word of the Atomic Shop staying entirely cosmetic, but if there‚Äôs a market for utilities, then they‚Äôre going to want to capitalise. I‚Äôve never personally found the need to purchase them myself, but to each their own.
---
My hope is that these items don‚Äôt overshadow the cosmetic side of the shop going forward. The issue I have with the Atomic Shop itself, is the pricing of items (the Cosmetic side of things), which sometimes can be fair and other times, too overpriced. That and the idea of repaying for costumes and outfits previously used in prior Fallout games. I can‚Äôt say I support that idea all that much. 
---
That‚Äôs my take. Remember, ‚ÄúEvery Voice Matters‚Äùüòú
---
The bashing idea comes from the fact that the minigun‚Äôs shredder barrel is boosted by the Basher perk. Currently the only use for that perk is if you‚Äôre using a dry minigun with no ammo as a pseudo melee weapon (which I do)
---
I figured since the chainsaw is held like a heavy gun, it might be neat for it to be considered bash damage, the same way the shredder barrel is when you hold down the trigger
---
Yeah just saw that. Very cool. If he's that dishonest online I can imagine what type of person he is irl. Should've been safer. Next time I'll know.
---
Like wtf are we supposed to do for another five months lol...? NW is basically dead on PC already. Yikes.
---
are you looking for a view? Resource extractors? Water?
---
What was his gt?
---
I thought of a solution a while back. Why not have weapons mods for certain unarmed weapons? The brass knuckles for example should have a PA mod making it bigger to accommodate the larger metal fingers.
---
Make it a tamed feral ghoul that "sells" random harder to find junk items like a pristine garden gnome in exchange for like 150 scrap copper.  Just examples but itd be nice to have a way to off load excess scrap in exchange for collectables.
---
It‚Äôs something you put in your shoe for good luck
---
I‚Äôm at work right now, I don‚Äôt really remember - they were three stars, 250% damage, (or damage resistance), while aiming and had bloodied, furious and either executioner or assassin? For I think three of them. The others I think I traded back. I‚Äôm on Ps4. I don‚Äôt do too much in regards to weapon building and perks... I should probably figure that out lol. But I hate the railway rifles because they‚Äôre so heavy and their ammo is *crazy* heavy
---
Sorry to say it, but that was really dumb of you. 
---
It's like going to a shop, you never bin before, take some stuff and say that you'll pay it later.
---
The buzz blade is the only one that‚Äôs halfway decent right now, with 14 base damage at 15 strengths before you start adding in buffs or perks.
---
The ripper with extended blade is 7 under the same conditions. I‚Äôm sure if you stack everything under the sun it becomes usable, but that shouldn‚Äôt be required to use these weapons if you ask me.
---
No I was joking man. Honestly place it in the most beautiful spot you find. That's how most people do it. Farming techniques aside.
---
Do people actually buy the scrap kits and repair kits?
---
I admit, I have some of my own, but only because they were bundled into $10 for 1500+costume Atom deals.  I've never used one.  I can repair my gear up to 200% without them.   
---
I know people buy the fridge.  I'm surprised by how many I've seen considering the refrigerated backpack has a better percentage.  But then, I may just get one for decoration if a cool-looking one comes out.
---
Yeah, at the moment I‚Äôm using a Commando build and even I only have 9 points in Perception cause there aren‚Äôt that many other useful cards. I run 1Commando, 1ExpertCommando, 1MasterCommando 3TankKiller, and 3ConcentratedFire just cause I also use VATS a lot. You can relocate the extra 3 points into Luck for extra damage or Intelligence/Strength for extra utility.
---
Wright? Have you done to ‚Äòright‚Äô and ‚Äòwrite‚Äô what popular culture did to ‚ÄòBeniffer‚Äô and ‚ÄòBrangelina‚Äô?
---
My stash of legendaries grows quickly, so it wouldn't matter if the sale was on or not unfortunately
---
You can deploy your camp on any boat, even small ones, or bit of debris floating on the water. Concrete foundations work on lake bottoms.
---
Also the "kill big creatures" world challenge I believe? Is still bugged. Former Friend of mine soloed the queen and he still never unlocked it
---
I think this got removed for name dropping.
---
A flick in the balls lol.. what about when they log/crash right after you appear at their base?
---
I just asked the question, I didn't tell you shit
---
I dont care about the fridge.
---
I‚Äôve got a spot but was just wondering lol
---
Another small thing which will improve things. Use the official fallout gold and blue. Just color pick from the website or vault boy. But beware that vault boys colors change slightly depending on which game he is in.
---
I got the red rocket sign the day it came out, and build it in all my camps... I had no clue it did this hahaha
---
mambit7, thank you for your kindness :). What time zone are you in?
---
U.S central
---
Am I old? We just had Art I, II, and III
---
Or was this a private school or something?
---
Much the same way your parents feel about you.
---
Wish i dindnt need weight perks id probly use more defensive ones
---
Love no, but I did like them enough to pre-order the pa edition (my first and last pre order ever.)
---
I think it is fair to make the assumption that their future games will be riddle with MTX after hearing Todd talk about how millions of people still play Fo4 and Skyrim but they have 'no touch point' to sell them more stuff. 76 is their prototype beta for all kinds of 'touch points.'
---
I wish that when you equipped an unarmed weapon in PA you'd just use your normal fists, but with the weapon speed, damage, mods and legendary effects tacked on.
---
I hope that official mod support will come with single-player/p2p servers so that we don't have to pay to mod our own worlds.
---
How am I cherry picking? That is literally the entire point of this conversation. It doesn't matter to me how much it helps you in the game as long as it does. You having 1 more rubber than me may not make you win or lose but it gives you something that wasn't just cosmetic. It was something you bought with real money. There's no cherry picking going on because you are obfuscating the issue. I don't care how small of an advantage it gives you. I don't care if it means one time you don't have to fast travel somewhere to get rubber out of your entire 200000000 hour  play through. If it's not cosmetic I have an issue with it. That's what you don't seem to get. The people that are mad don't think it gives some insane advantage. Most don't even care that it's a slippery slope that could end up effecting game balance in the long road. They care that its not cosmetic and any more info than that doesn't even matter.
---
There is no catch all best place. I'm level 200 with 700 hours in. You learn things as you go. Farming and junk gets a lot easier to come by. So does xp, gear etc.
---
I blow through 5 just fighting mutants sometimes
---
There was barely any reason to play it before either way, unless your some legendary grinding masochist, and I know a few, there is no end game. Private servers could be interesting.
---
The fact we have to pay for servers in the first place is ridiculous. Add to that the fact the only way to play with any REAL mods (game changing types...if they ever allow them) is to pay for a server!
---
Then the whole cross play between private and public...they better freaking allow it. I am not making a new main character and losing all my progress on my old main. FUCK THAT.
---
They just need to monitor mods so any "cheat" mods like giving the player unlimited amounts of items or what have you is detected and gets you kicked from public servers.
---
I disagree with that, if someone is a confirmed scammer name and shame them. I agree accused scammers shouldn't be named because it can damage a reputation
---
Honestly the mole miners freak me out more than any other enemy/creature in the game. Every time I hear that gas mask stifled scream I jump. 
---
I don't even wanna know what they look like under there. Wouldn't mind the cosmetic though.
---
Yes please.  And here I thought it was just an issue with my setup.
---
Sure. For 1400 atoms.
---
they dont have to allow anyone to get a shot thats not their responsibility or why they are playing thats not bein antisocial. Secondly according to you they should change out the gear they have worked hard for just to make other people happy. so to you thats fair they deminish their gameplay to make others happy. What about their gaming experience isnt it diminished???? how is that fair. Geared players are always looking for better there is not such thing as a perfect setup or build. BUT according to you thats it they have reached a level gear is not needed, they should use a level 10 weapon and do minimal damage and then let everyone take a shot. YAY the world is perfect everyone enjoyed themselves come on give me a break your pretty one sided there. Give me a break
---
They already announced this is coming, probably soon.
---
Antisocial doesn't mean what you think it means and I'm not the OP
---
You must care, we must fling fridges at the SQB, or maybe just the OP
---
I see my response was  missing a word but yah i agree i still play it though however hell will freeze over before i ever drop a penny on a microtransaction of any kind
---
OR
---
u can hoard weapons and ammo and rob peasants that do the actual work. js
---
Hm, placed it on a platform. I hope it's not just transformed to ether or something. I really like building and that would be pretty crappy.
---
Why take it out? It only adds more weapon diversity.
---
That's your problem, "could end up effecting". Stop being butthurt over an appliance and a robot. I've tried leveling with you, but your so angry I'm not even enjoying the conversation. Keep ignoring the rest of the post and keep picking out a sentence or two to argue with. Later.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen one in months so I‚Äôm curious if they did
---
The only reason I didn't freak out first time I came across the one on the road in the Mire is because I had my freakout moment a few years earlier when I ran into one in Far Harbor. When I saw the van sitting on the road all alone in the Mire, I jumped into my PA *immediately*. Fool me once, and all that.
---
Dang that sucks I‚Äôm not sure :/
---
He's a confirmed scammer on that super awesome sub Reddit you can't talk about on here for stupid reasons.
---
"You father was a hamster and your mother smelt of elderberry".
---
in Bethesda‚Äôs economy it would be 1,000 boiled waters to ft nextdoor
---
Depends on where you usually travel. What are you working on? What are you into?
---
no i know what antisocial is and your mistaken just saying hi to someone is being social you dont have to buy them a coffee as well.
---
I understand it being a paid service for console but their should be an option for PC to host your own. Who knows maybe Bufizda will do something nice for a change.
---
Depends on your intentions. I personally have mine as a support camp near fissure site prime just by the bunker where most people fight the queen. The walls are made up of foundations and the top uses floor pieces so that it doesn't get destroyed. I still have to repair some stuff because the scorchbeast radiation attack can sometimes go through the roof.
---
Its still up i think? Im missing the dark Wood laminate :(
---
Dude that is so stupid! It‚Äôs literally the best trading sub for the game! They need to check themselves on that shit. It‚Äôs a little absurd imo.
---
No you don't.
---
Which is why I'm ugly, so what.
---
Some pepole arnt courteous to other players. 
---
When I hit UF, I rad away out of bloodied so I dont one shot everything.
---
Then I put on a 10mm pistol, or my PoS TSE Handmade that does craptastic damage
---
I dont use my bloodied setup because its unfair to others.  The bloodied build is for solo content and wandering, and if I choose to go, Queen fights.
---
They‚Äôre still in my buddy got one yesterday
---
It's so counter-intuitive. The people using unarmed, getting up close and personal with enemies, are the ones who need heavy armor the most. I can only assume they had animation issues with it and that's why it was cut from Fallout 4 (and thusly carried over into this game). But I'd really like to see a patch that eliminates this restriction, or at the very least maybe they could add some unarmed-oriented PA mods, or maybe even unarmed weapons specifically for Power Armor. 
---
I miss the military looking Power Fist from 3/NV. It literally looks like it's designed to work with Power Armor.
---
I need to know more
---
Have to log out of the game all the way, the restart it and add from main menu, in my experience.
---
Havent seen any for months, either.  Still holding on to the ones I have.  Me like big boom stick
---
Unfortunately no. I'm not that smart. Just autocorrect.
---
This viperu2 is an example of social behavior.
---
Now I'm just confused lmoa what subreddit?
---
so just being in a match saying hi is being social i dont have to do anything else or be nice to be social.
---
Yea executioners perk is pretty good! I have a reduced weight 50 cal that I switch to on the queen when she gets a to half health and you can watch the health deplete and I have 0 heavy gun perks.
---
\^This. Honestly, I agree. People act like this is a subscription based game or that there are items locked behind a pay wall. If you don't want to support this game financially or spend more money on it- you literally don't have to. But they do have to make money some how to keep it going. Why wouldn't they give you incentives to spend money **if you choose to** so that they can keep the game going and fund the development of future content and ensure longevity? It would be a terrible business model otherwise...as long as they keep P2W items out of the item shop, I'll be happy. And scrap kits and refrigerators aren't it.
---
You really don't know what antisocial behavior is do you.
---
It has to be a in-game outfit, not through the Atomic Shop
---
The one you and I normally post on. Your post gets removed here if you mention it by name apparently.
---
I personally think it would be more fun if the Grafton Monster. It looks like a tank, but goes down easier than a similarly leveled mirelurk.
---
Funnily enough, the blackpowder rifle has a higher DPS than the Dragon, and the blackpowder pistol has a higher DPS than the blackpowder rifle.
---
I already told you once. 
---
You are not ugly.
---
Lmao!  I Summon archer dan!!!
---
I also agree I started playing the week NW was released and I‚Äôve hated it the whole time I‚Äôve played.
---
I still say at the very least make it a weekly reset
---
I would definitely give you some caps for the Bloodied grenade launcher if you can hold it for about 30 minutes until I can get on.
---
I am and I'm proud, you are a liar and smoking the halfings leaves have turned you mind to gobbly goo.
---
Might be an issue then :( im in the UK and evening is in a few hours for me
---
ok like i said enjoy not getting hits and yes ill be super "antisocial" thanks
---
Good point
---
Nah, I'll be off in a couple days then. I'll meet you then and give you the set with mods.
---
Did Uranium Fever yesterday. I didn't get any legionaries because there were too many people, and most were 'one shoting' everything in sight. Really disappointing.
---
Cave crickets and west tek doesnt take very long as long as thats not what ur after
---
I've been playing since launch and could have easily specced into a Bloodied sniper build. I didn't do that because I know how kill tagging in MMOs works and I'm not a dick.
---
You can also fire more than 1 shot every ten seconds with the Gauss.
---
You get them for free from a terminal so I assume not that much lol
---
Exactly! Gone are the days of a fixed price for a gaming experience. You pay up front, pay for the online access, and pay for improvements. That‚Äôs just how it is :) And we are rewarded with amazing experiences!
---
Other bloodied builds have replied to this thread and they tone it down in groups because that's the social thing to do. If you don't understand how you're being antisocial you need to figure it out or you're going to have a tough time in life.
---
I have this gut feeling like private servers are literally just going to be regular servers, but locked to friends-only. We already know mods aren't coming until later, but I wouldn't be surprised if there aren't even any server settings to customize. At least not right away anyway.
---
I'd be completely okay with having to create a new character that's server-locked if it meant I was able to tweak xp gain, drop rates, enable/disable certain features, etc. That's how most survival games I've played handle it. That's kind of the appeal for me, hell I wouldn't even mind paying for it if it meant better stability on top of that.
---
What? I even said most don't even care that it could end up effecting. Are you even reading the same posts?
---
Survival Mode got shut down partially because people were sick of getting one-shotted by Bloodied snipers using the Chameleon mutation when they were looking for fair and exciting fights. Bloodied builds have been a severe issue in every mode of the game since launch.
---
I would think that progress wouldn't carry either. Like each mode would have their own individual save state for that character.
---
Agreed its too low, personally I say make it unlimited as I have a reason to play all day instead of getting bored when I hit cap for caps and scrip from scrip machine and vendors. Please let me enjoy the game instead of waiting 24hrs.
---
Probably like 100 Caps for the entire set?
---
It doesn't take much to get to Cranberry Bog and progress the Brotherhood quest line and get those plans.
---
This was awesome, thank you
---
Hopefully the ability to host p2p servers comes with official mod support so that we don't have to pay to mod our own worlds.
---
You would have to be at the max weight limit, which is about 1650 lbs for one of my characters, then that error message would be correct. I haven't tested it but I would expect that you could not receive any more weapons or armor from the Purveyor when you are on/over the weight limit, although you would still lose the cost in scrip.
---
But its still funny as Beth's coding is so messed up sometimes, they must be: (a) pasting the same error message all over the place, or (b) defaulting to that error message when there's an error but no proper code to handle that error.
---
LOL damn i was expecting an awesome weapon damn sorry :(
---
I'm thinking not. Anyway have a good one.
---
Spent 1150 and got hot garbage. Who needs 3 furious fatmen with bash damage?
---
I got a Ghoul slayers gamma gun first item last night... I said "nope..." , Server hopped and still ended up with another Ghoul slayers gamma gun in the midst of my transactions. Lots of similar shit, it doesn't make sense if this really is RNG.
---
Exploited and gated by legacy legendaries.
---
Yeah my plan is NOT to make it water tight, but instead I would be able to swim around in side it and then interact with things as normal as if I was on land. Aqua boy would prevent me from getting rads and hence be able to sleep, and hopefully interact with all objects in camp. Although, now you have said that it reminds me of the cut content on Fallout 4 which was a Under water vault, sealed air tight, that would be amazing if they brought something like that into CAMP making. I hope to see more camp related stuff and DLC in the future, just like they did for Fallout 4. I really want to be able to capture animals and creatures and have arenas like gladiators like we had in FO4. I would love to make a Appalachia zoo.
---
on xbox i see them unsold in the 150-200c range.  the quest giving the plans free keeps the price low.
---
the mod plans on the otherhand, sell for a nice chunk of change since SH PA came out.
---
I feel the same way
---
They take a hit to their damage output if not fully charged, but when it's hitting so hard it barely matters.
---
Have an BE &amp; IE, got another decent bloodied &amp; a Junkies from drops the last week. The hit &amp; distance of the gun is unreal. Biggest drawback for me is the measly 5 round magazine but it has to be balanced in some way.
---
We all get one when the Sun rises in the West and sets in the East...
---
Dude I thought out of 20 I would get something good! I was getting double VATs perks on horrible weapons and horrible prefixes! I kept thinking it was going to finally drop that good one but it just never happened. Maybe today is the day!
---
Bunch of Todd specials for me. üôÑ
---
No as it already exists on PC and makes no difference as I see it as a timed exclusive for PC as the team who makes this game is incompetent hence why no in game yet despite 1 entire year of waiting.
---
They don't need to use a level 10 weapon, they just need to not use a Bloodied ranged weapon they've soaked themselves with radiation for so they're doing 5000 crit damage and instantly killing the event's guaranteed legendary in one shot. No one is doing Free Range for the Mutton Pie recipe, OHKOing power gamers know damn well they're fucking people out of that legendary they were expecting for following a bunch of stupid cows around for five minutes.
---
Vampires minigun, furious AR and Tesla
---
I got a mutant's/ffr handmade I'm willing to part with. I use an AA/FFR handmade myself and the ffr makes it a beast. I'm on PC. Same IGN as here.
---
That's what happens when you don't pray to RNGsus.
---
Playing a high leveled character with a low level friend always sucks tho. Division. Dead by Daylight, any MMO, Monster Hunter.. none of them makes it fun for two severely different leveled characters to play together, unless you nerf your own gear and perks, or simply roll a new character (which is the better option imo, i hate feeling like a noob while my friend one-hits and makes the game super easy)
---
 Scorch, Some babies were dropped on their heads but you were clearly thrown at a wall.
---
Yah ive been at max scrip for 1 week and legendary junk keep growing and i cant just throw 5 scrip in the trash can
---
That's X-O1, Ultracite drops from the last bos quest
---
Given that any home-servers would remove the need for players to visit the atom shop (Or, cynically thinking, whatever paid-mods solution they have in mind for private worlds), I highly doubt anyone's going to be able to host on their own computers at any point in time, short of someone taking the time and effort to reverse engineer and homebrew their own software. Given the modding community seems to feel they've been beaten with the short end of the stick with FO76, I would'nt hold my breath.
---
I always like the forest region, it's quite pretty.
---
Oh yeah I know you're talking about
---
Yea I messed up big time. I probably should of cut my loses for the day but I couldn‚Äôt stop!!!
---
You: "WHY!?!?"
---
Beefeesda: "BECAUSE! REASONS!"
---
üôèüèº
---
You sir are a true legend, and thanks for this advice I will see what I can in this respect. I think we can have maximum 5 floors high, so I would imagine I could go 5 floors down, into the water if I put the camp right at the very top.
---
I dont think they would do offline. Current iteration it would be the dullest experience I could imagine in a game, post wastelanders it could be good, hard to say but it would bring it in line with thier older games.
---
Why do you say that.
---
I dislike fridge, it looks like it was designed by team of developers who don't know how to make games being tied to stash limit and having a limit of 15 items per fridge.
---
They changed the mission rewards a tad. You get the full set of ultracite for free. If you already did the quest go back and look at one of the computers for the plans.
---
You know you get full set for free when you complete BOS quests right?
---
Yea thats what I meant.
---
And it is still on a terminal.
---
The armour drops after the quest, but you can get the plans for free from the BoS terminal
---
I realized i didnt respond to your idea of having shared loot and exp while in an actual group, which might solve a lot, yeah
---
The best thing I got(so far) was a vampires mini-gun and an auto-reduced weight grenade launcher...but both pretty meh, still. I wound up with a Mutant's Laser gun,  Troubleshooter's Crossbow,  (meh) and an Exterminators wooden right leg that has breathe underwater. I might keep the wood leg and the laser gun, but that crossbow is going away when there is more scrip when I login today.
---
No problem, send me a friend request when you are available and message me when you are on.
---
I switched from ranged to melee, hoping I could get something cool and I got a vampires limb damage +1 agility war drum! Sheesh
---
It‚Äôs down to three factors everyone has their own preference between, trading you will probably build near whitesprings, utility you will build near the resource pile of your need (lead ect) , and or view where you want an great looking camp
---
Hopefully a mutated turkey that we can stuff and put in our camp or wear on our head
---
You be grateful what Bethesda bestowed on you!
---
Wall babies grow up stronger
---
Lack of customization opportunities is a major pain point for me...CAMPs are the only place I can use items in interesting ways and actually be creative.
---
I love collecting/crafting outfits in online games, but ultimately the fact that there are just 3 outfit slots in FO76 (Head, Face, and ENTIRE BODY) is SO limiting.
---
I feel like I compare this game a lot to ESO, which is a very different game, but it has a TON of customization options available to players...its got 7 slots for different armor pieces (Helm/Chest/Shoulder/Gloves/Belt/Legs/Boots) compared to FO76's 6 (one of which is under armor), all of which can be recolored individually (3 color slots each!) to create a unique look. For store-based outfits (much more akin to the outfits on the Atom shop), they ALSO allow recoloring of them. Just THAT functionality would make outfits more appealing...
---
As it stands now, armor + under armor looks don't have a lot of variation visually and you're stuck looking like a grubby weirdo with mix/match or trading away your spleen to get the armor combo you want because of the end-games' reliance on RNG payouts...or you just look like a cookie-cutter copy in an outfit. Even if it didn't DO anything, being able to apply the Eye of Ra to other outfits would at least change them up visually and allow for SOME kind of interesting visual combos...game needs more items like that. :(
---
Both can be obtained through a terminal 
---
Brotherhood terminal gives ultracite 
---
Enclave terminal gives Xo1
---
i got a nice bloodied gatling laser i do way more damage now but thats after 2000 scrip now i have a ton of crap in my stash
---
I just started playing a couple months ago and in the level 40's. I don't see why anyone would buy the kits. There is workbenches everywhere and resources are easy to get so to me your just wasting your money. Its not even that hard to find everything one needs and quickly once you know where things are. People were complaining about the junk Robot as play to win. Please, that Bot gives you very little and its just cosmetic, you get no real advantage in having him when you can go to any building nearby and loot if not more than what the junk bot is collecting. Let the people waste the money on these things if they want. Just worry about you. The game is fun to play and ya its gets boring sometimes but I just take a break for a few days to play something else. The fridge is not an advantage either. If I had one I would come back to spoiled food because I forgot about the food regardless that it keeps longer, just like it spoils in my inventory and I forget to use some before it spoils. I do agree its getting worse in that they are testing the waters, seeing how much they can get away with. Im fine with some paying for minor convienence but I can see them turning this into advantages.
---
I find it strange they chose meat week instead of the parade
---
Both my parents died ten years ago. Do I suppose depending on what one believes they probably don't.
---
The tire thing was hilarious, they released like 4 variants in a short period. xD
---
It goes back to what I was saying earlier-- they're now selling us basic items that should have been in the game as 150 cap plans.
---
I dislike the name raymond for anyone who isn't a trucker.
---
Or just kill the first mole miner that shows up grab their weapon and use that for the rest of the event. That‚Äôs been my way of doing it for a while now and it works well I can kite the supervisors around for everyone to tag.
---
Yeah I LOVE ESO's dye system, it is super robust and allows for a lot of creativity and customization even if you have access to limited items.
---
There's even Atom Shop items I might have bought if I could recolor them...that poodle skirt in black + orange for Halloween would look killer for example.
---
Really? Where do I find that quest?
---
Probably because The Dragon takes forever to reload. I found one of them with a treasure map and was surprised at how much damage it did, but was also surprised that it took so long to reload it rendering it essentially useless. Now it's just a curio on display with the Meteoric sword and Legendary Mutant's Shovel.
---
haha, ive been doing mining helmet, gas mask, and padded blue jacket as my psuedo mole person outfit.
---
You cant have a tse Aa Handmade it's either tse or aae but you cant have two primary legendary effects
---
I was abandoned in an alleyway trash can and raised by hobos. Wait, we're still joking right? If you are serious then I'm sorry for your loss, but this thread is meant for arguments and insults.
---
Yea maybe my issue is that I‚Äôm looking for a great roll. Like a good prefix (not enemy specific) and at least 1 good perk that benefits me. Or a good drop that I can use to trade at least.
---
Yeah we did logos in mine, final project was was an ad poster for whatever we wanted though. I waited til the last day to just throw something together, ended up having fun on it for 6 hrs lol
---
agreed
---
Yeah I made some changes and it makes sense, also your heavy guns advice I'll probably go for them later on, I'm going for it since I can switch out heavy guns and shotguns and I kind of used them as an alternative to my rifles. 
---
I made these changes:
---
S10 - Bandolier 1, Full Charge 2, Strong back 2, Sturdy Frame 2, Heavy gunner 1, E Heavy G 1, M Heavy G 1
---
P9 - Concentrated Fire 1, Rifleman 1, Exp Rifleman 1, Mast Rifleman 1, Glow sight 1, Tank Killer 3, Green thumb 1
---
E9- Dromedary 2, Good Doggy 1, Lead belly 1, Slow Metabolizer 2, Vaccinated 2, Rejuvenated 1
---
C5- Lone Wanderer 4, Travel Agent 1
---
I8 - First Aid 1, Portable Power 2, Power User 3, Stabilized 2
---
A7 - Action Boy 1, Thru-Hiker 1, White Knight 3, Adrenaline 2
---
L8 - Scrounger 1, Bloody mess 3, Starched genes 2, Class Freak 2
---
I didn't go for any lockpicking or hacking since I'll load them in and out when need, same as crafting perks.
---
I will trade steel for copper if you're on XB1!
---
I‚Äôve played since just after it came out and I‚Äôm level 50. It takes a while but what you want to remember is you get more xp from surviving as opposed to kills.
---
That and not every1 has space in their inventory for a terrible weapon
---
Lol yea my weight is all screwed up and that‚Äôs with 4 pieces of weapon weight reduction armor!
---
Dont dare mention screws or fiber from the robot. They will burn you at the stake.
---
No sir. Just as I said many many times befor. You are definitely not ugly.
---
Quad ffr Gamma gun
---
Remember when TSE Dragon was the shit? Before they capped PVP damage.
---
People say this but the simple fact is that someone somewhere at the company must have crunched the numbers and found that doing it this way was more profitable.
---
Remember how everyone on this sub freaked out about the fridge and the robot? Well, I've seen tons of them in camps, plenty of people here who bought them, hell there were even people who said they were going to buy them specifically to spite those who were complaining about it.
---
So it goes. Remember when everyone was complaining about $20 power armor skins? How many people have you seen since then with that Liberty Prime skin they sold? Tons.
---
It isn't even exclusive to FO76. Every game I've ever seen that has had some controversy involving mtx, there are still plenty of people that buy the stuff. And at the end of the day, as long as someone, somewhere is buying it - and they're bringing in more money from them than they're potentially losing from people who are upset - they'll keep doing it.
---
RNGs gonna RNG..
---
Dang that‚Äôs good for pvp people. If you don‚Äôt use it you could at least trade it.
---
I dislike you more!
---
Respect on being a generally good human being, and not spreading mis-information!
---
Thanks, did that and some other suggested changes. This is what I got now:
---

I yam what I yam
---
I was just about to type EXACTLY these points haha...can never take the GD hat off. I'm that guy critiquing the formatting on the local dive's menu. v\_v
---
Stop that
---
I will give you the same amount of caps as Jon, but plus 1.
---
Kidding I‚Äôm at work go nuts lmao
---
They aint dead, their just hiding, unless of course they are really dead and Scorch is the one hiding
---
Im serious. I'll really get the violins out. My step mother died six months after my father. She was already terminally ill. I had to tell her he'd died as she lay dying Worst thing Ive ever had to do. My birth mother died when I was four and a half, in front of me of a brain hemorrhage. Its all been fucking chuckles. But hey I haven't murdered anyone. Yet.
---
Where are you in the main story?
---
I like the mire and noob areas when i get tired of mobs destroying my base
---
But this isn't a discussion about being very different levels.  I recently started playing again with a friend, we both made new chars.  Its still a huge annoyance that if he or I one shot a mob with a sneak attack, the other person doesn't get credit.
---
Only one yep
---
if you dont have room for a backup weapon, you need to work on your inventory management.  
---
10mm pistols weigh next to nothing.
---
Tldr of this conversation
---
Intentionally obfuscate the conversation, when baits not taken pretend cherry picking is happening, when called out literally misquoting to make it sound like something was said that wasn't, then exiiting the conversation.
---
That was fun.
---
Those items dont mean skill in every case some could just be sheer amounts of time devoted to it all but im sure thats the exception.
---
You have to play a lot. Hide in bushes and last until the end to get the most XP. No need to ever kill anyone.
---
Haven‚Äôt even started it, I‚Äôve just been pissing around in whitesprings and doing the enclave missions
---
I just miss reliably being able to maintain an inventory of mutton chops for my unarmed build.
---
In the unlikely event that one shot doesn't kill (or if you miss) switching weapons is always an option.
---
The Gauss doesn't have any advantage on the black powder rifle in this game beyond allowing a silencer in the role both guns excel at - sniping a single target. If you are engaging multiple targets both guns are a poor choice.
---
Yes, so easy on PC and it breaks with every release. Yes, it's patched quick, but Beth has to make sure that it works on all platforms and that it both backward and forward compatible,  something a modder doesn't have to do
---
Thank you. Good to know. I'm going to focus myself on surviving and not killing peoples. 
---
How often and how many hours per day do you play if I may ask?
---
I'll try that if it continues. I gave up for the morning since I had to get ready for work. Thanks!
---
Is that a model?
---
The plans drop from a terminal... the actual armor drops from the quest
---
In my opinion it should do almost twice the damage it does for the amount of hoops it asks you to jump through.
---
Over on the far eastern edge of the map there's a string of junk nodes, I really like camping on the node that is closest to Black Mountain - but, the sound effects from some of the bugs are so loud that it makes it difficult to remain there for very long unless you build most of your camp up the cliffs away from the water.
---
It's about to change significantly next week with release of private servers and first moment when like-minded people will be allowed to connect for the first time, it will change much within next few weeks
---
Hard earned caps 
---
Hard earned money
---
Pick one Bethesda.
---
you could never get a standard backpack in offline singleplayer...
---
I'm just gonna leave this one alone. Sorry again.
---
Yes, this is what I wrote.
---
Always good to find others who can read English!
---
Would love it but would imagine Bethesda would mess up and causes 16x times the server crashes.
---
me too! when i had to take time off from playing, i was pretty worried i might have missed the tiles.
---
No worries pal.
---
Breathe buddy, you won. Breathe. You are so right about everything and all other points made are garbage.
---
Lol. Enclave are the last ones in the main quest...  
---
Responders lead to fire breather (a sub faction of responder) which leads to raider which leads to free states which leads to BOS which leads to enclave.
---
I'm a little sad that this post was followed by Bethesda pushing back Wastelanders during a content drought, and basically BSing us with spin about the atom shop. But at least we're getting private servers and they finally brought up mods again, so those are big pluses (potentially haha).
---
BTW, I watched a couple of your videos the other day and they were entertaining. I hope you're able to keep getting fun out of the game while gently mocking it. xD
---
I also agree with the smaller flooring to be able to have designs as well, they really stick out when everything else is nice and clean
---
OP is talking about the plans...
---
It doesn‚Äôt compel me to buy from the Atom shop. If anything it‚Äôs a deterrent. I‚Äôll log in, scrip to my 150 and log out until I can scrip again. I‚Äôll play something else in between.
---
Far too low and if it were higher you'd actually get people to log in and stay in the game longer, here's why:
---
1. your 1000 scrip max gets you n-number of items most of which gets recycled to more scrips, the rest is dumped into your stash which maxes out, if maxed out then no more incentive to stay in the game and farm for more legendaries therefore....log out until your 150 scrip is reset.  You've just spent 10 min at the machine juggling inventory.
---
2. more scrip max = more items to get out of your stash = more room = more incentive to go farm for more legendaries = more game time = more possibility you'll buy something from the atom shop = win/win
---
3. See # 2 , what are you waiting for, increase the 150 limit now!  
---
4. that is all have a nice day, be wise(er)
---
Anyway, yeah, so workshops are/arent meant for pvp.
---
I sort of get the impression that the whole 'scrip' thing is designed to be disappointing, much like the reality of where the idea of ['scrip'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_scrip) came from.
---
I'm a new player. Whats scrip?
---
many many games to reach 100, i feel ive played a ton, and im still only level 40 or something
---
I was able to do it, but it was ridiculously tedious, and not really worth it. Basically, you did one of two things:
---
1. Dug yourself a hole in the seafloor, plugged it behind you, and then hollowed out the area below you.
---
2. Blocked out the space you wanted (i.e. - the exterior "shell"), and then filled in every open space within that shell with sand (since it just falls to the bottom, it's easier to fill in the hole). Once done, you then dug out all of the sand, and the open space would then be empty of water.
---
This may be one of the only situations where building in FO76 is *easier* than Minecraft.
---
I will openly admit to buying atoms and purchasing things like scrap and repair kits.  They are certainly useful especially at inopportune times like the SBQ or Encryptid events.
---
I‚Äôm not a costume or camp guy so the other stuff isn‚Äôt appealing to me but it sure seems like a lot of other people do.  More power to them.  
---
My main frustration is it seems they are devoting their time and resources to the Atom Shop instead of fixing all the broken shit in the game.
---
Ok so what happened? Better be beyond horrible for you to post names, also never post someone's real name if you think it may be it.
---
ok this is adorable!
---
Id love a return to isometric FO games like this
---
Oh I never knew that ultracite plans came from a terminal I thought you got both the plans and the full set by finishing a quest
---
I have an Instigating The Dragon. It's basically "One Punch Gun", but way too ineffective to seriously use.
---
Bethesda: Instructions unclear *makes ammunition cost atoms to craft*
---
When first starting out, wherever you are.  
---
About level 30 or so, a midway point between your XP farming areas to save on travel cost. 
---
As a high level, you can pick wherever you want.   For me, it would be the far side of the lake near Thunder Mountain.   But its out of bounds.  Same with the other side of the river on the left side of the map.  
---
I like building near water but, other than the stream running from Top of the World to Alpha Silo, there aren't a lot of good build spots.
---
Maybe people will finally start trading properly now instead of being tight arsed mofos and over relying on mmurgh
---
3D render
---
Dumb question perhaps, but does anything at all transfer to adventure?
---
Tin foil hat theory: Free States cosmetics are just Fourth of July stuff that didn't get finished in time.
---
In-game achievement-based items are a must in a modern persistent online game imo.
---
I had a missle turret on top of one of my large water purifiers, when I moved, the turret was stuck inside of the water purifier. I had to scrap the whole thing to get it out.
---
I hate these Atom shop ideas. How about we ask for this kind of stuff to just be in the game? I'm so sick of seeing cool stuff appear only in the atom shop. All this does is show Bethesda that people will pay for extra shit. 
---
I've already spent $60 dollars and way too many hours on a barely playable game, plus Creation Club because PS4 players got fucked on mods.
---
Bethesda doesn't need any more of my money. I'm completely disgusted by Bethesda at this point.
---
I did that and it still didn‚Äôt say I collected, I also found 2 random ones and those never counted either.
---
I've been there when someone's done that. The funny thing pre-public events was seeing a lot of people not realising and fast travelling to v9 anyway :D
---
Well if anything it will definitely put some good weapons into the market. Maybe not a bunch of great weapons and armor (all 3 stars perfect) but some good things for fair prices. I know I‚Äôm going to sell a few of these random things I got instead of scraping them because I feel like the more casual players could use/afford them.
---
I have mine just outside by the top of the world. Near a train station, alot of foot traffic, and I farm the weapons from the mobs for steel. Being centrally located I usually have tons of ppl checking my vendor machines.
---
gt Chqnko Lagerfeld is another scammer to watch out for. Reddit is u/ReanimatrixYT
---
I have an Insti myself as my mains workhorse, it takes what 2 Secs to fully charge? And the reload for the 5  rounds isn‚Äôt that long, shorter than the BPR I would imagine (Don‚Äôt actually know) 
---
My point being, if you aggro 3-4 mooks, a Gauss can deal with them all, a BPR can‚Äôt, and you have to switch to backup/ Melee.
---
They no longer get any applause feom me until they keep at least 1 of their deadlines and have it work all on schedule. This delay while good since they suck is a serious kick in the teeth
---
I disagree only because i happen to own it already &gt;:P its the rarest floor tile in game!
---
I just hopped on for the first time in months last night. Still had all my crap and my building was unmodified. Was very happy. Diddnt lag, diddnt disconnect. Shits were placing perfectly. I thinknim gonna get back into it untill breakpoint has its turn to get kinks worked out.
---
Oh dang I didn‚Äôt even know that! Some people get good stuff but you never know. My buddy got 2 quad explosive .44s and a quad explosive hunting rifle with a VATs 3rd perk! Might not be great for him to use but definitely trade towards something worthy!
---
Since you dient6agree that it was an Atom challenge, I'm going out on a limb that it's some strange trend... ü§î
---
What's RNG...?
---
I will ask Lance and get back to you
---
Protectrons took all the logging jobs. The rolling pins of Appalachia have more history to tell than the chainsaws. What's more American than beating a Liberator with a rolling pin that made over 1,000 apple pies before the bombs fell?
---
I would bet money the mods are better
---
The thing that bothers me is this:
---
Even though people asked for repair kits, fridges, whatever, how many said "Bethesda, can you pretty please make us spend Atoms for them, too?" They make it sound like there was this huge demand by the playerbase for it to go in the shop when people, for the most part, wanted it in a future update. And then, players are *still defending them on it*. For fucks' sakes, it's okay to like the game, buy Atoms, get outfits, but don't volunteer that we should pay for shit they said would be free from the start. Now they're fine with that for good.
---
"They never said that it would be cosmetic only." It's right in the article. I don't know why you wanted that to be false. I don't understand why you want to throw your money away. Now we all get less shit because you normalized it.
---
Bethesda is a little different from the EA and Activisions of the world, though, because they are actually a privately-owned company, and their parent company, Zenimax, isn't traded on the stock market.  It's partly because of that independence that they were able to do things like Prey, Wolfenstein, and The Evil Within - things that ended up being well-regarded critically, but don't exactly top the sales charts.  Make no mistake that if EA were behind Fallout 76, they would have aborted after only a month or two.
---
To their credit, Bethesda has tried to right the ship.  The problem is that they just don't seem to have the talent to do it.  The Burrows, Arktos, and Vault 94 are nice to look at, but the gameplay is piss poor.  If that aspect doesn't shape up, then Wastelanders is doomed from the start.
---
...yup...  you don't get to have everything and not all builds are viable or even possible.  All builds have to compromise somewhere.  Pretty much, your post boils down to "wish i had more perk points" but i guess that would be a "you" problem and this is r/FO76 after all.
---
Camp blueprints?? Cool idea for trade value as well. Show someone the build and that they can buy it for some caps.
---
I can't help it. It must be said.
---
I know you are, but what am I?
---
I have no idea but everyday I have seen it.  Seems like most matches today I saw a lot of em.  It makes me laugh!
---
But I literally JUST spelled it for him/her! lol
---
Yup agreed
---
Someone who took the long way around being name Jensen.
---
I burned all mine on armors.  
---
Most of it was your typical not wearable trash. 
---
There were a few unyeilding peices that made it to my vendor, but most of it was sold for caps at pleasant valley.
---
Depends but a few matches at night usually.
---
Receive Nothing Good
---
Sold for caps? To a vendor!!!???
---
Yeah I did sorta acknowledge that and a year from now plenty of people will have those items, but it's what makes it more important that we get more of these things not just for NW but for adventure too.
---
I read your comment in my head with a mean voice for some reason. Maybe just want to get out of work and play FO76. My bad bro
---
Short answer yes, but he will give me more details shortly
---
Well no one has asked this in so long. Idk
---
you unlock a couple of outfits, weapon and power armour skins, camp items and photo frames. here's a link that tells you what you get and at what level:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c0fsuy/list\_of\_nuclear\_winter\_rewards\_with\_images/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c0fsuy/list_of_nuclear_winter_rewards_with_images/)
---
i alongside many others are so thankful for the delay.
---
All the cosmetics from NW are available in Adv. They're unlocks in the Atom shop, so you can craft any of them in Adv, for any character under that account.
---
Yup, noone buys armors with underwater breathing or higher durability.
---
The good stuff (anythign with sent, cavs, powered) stayed in my vendor.

["No, this is Abuse."](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2hwqn9)
---
It's a great game
---
Thank you very much.
---
Oh, I'm not. I'm not holding my breath for a lot of things from Bethesda right now:
---
1. Private servers being something we can set up ourselves
---
2. Skins for my damned shotguns
---
3. Wastelanders working at launch
---
Not to mention ES6. Which will be buggy. And late. Because why wouldn't it? Skyrim was. 76 is.
---
Quest started: Redditor In A Fridge

XD
---
And you‚Äôd have to spend a day with hard-sell salesman who brings in his manager when you try to leave and offers you the same thing for half the price. Who then further drops the price to a mere fraction of the original price as you walk away, leaving you feeling really bad for the less aware people who bought at full price.
---
This isn't an argument, it's just contradiction!
---
I'm wondering if that'll work on NPCs in Wastelanders...
---
My best armor drops have mainly come as rewards for ‚ÄúForbidden Knowledge,‚Äù probably because I have never received the BOS Shielded Underarmor Plan.
---
Oh man! I love to go to vending machines and see  trash 3 stars for 250-300 caps. I buy them all every time. I kept everything that was trash to re scrip tho. I‚Äôm set for my daily scrip for a while already needless to say!!!
---
damn lol i was talking about the internet historian vid on fallout 76, was hoping i could start a ‚Äúlight wood laminate‚Äù chain.
---
Well thought out and well phrased, this pretty much states any gripes of mine.
---
I definitely don't understand why we can't have perk cards with higher ranked abilities gated behind reaching certain levels; literally how perks worked in the previous iteration, and it makes a lot more sense. It really almost seems like some of the design of 76 was *intended* to screw with people.
---
I wonder if using the luck bobblehead or grape mentats would improve our chances at all.
---
I didnt have room.  I was way overweight and my stash was full.
---
I'm sorry. I will try next door than.
---
Yea I dont think I‚Äôve had any luck with armor from the purveyor. On my little guy (level 25) he got an assassins sentinel AP refresh metal arm one time But it‚Äôs like level 10 I think! Lol
---
You have to die in order to correct this.
---
oh god... I was doing that quest the other day and a legendary sheepsquatch jumped me at one of the search points. I thought it was the target at first but no... There was a lot of running around and breaking a shotgun before I was able to wear it down. Dropped an Executioner Gauss Rifle though, so nice.
---
#A T O M
---
Idk but I have a full unyielding set so my luck is pretty damn high. But I have a couple bobble heads so I‚Äôm taking one today for the hell of it!
---
Oh! Sorry ive not seen that one, gonna go educate myself now :p
---
PC has had it for months. Was one of the first mods put out.
---
I've been playing weeknights since release. I'm by no means an alpha player, but I have characters at 130, 67, and two at 30+.
---
Hiding in a bush nets overseer XP, but killing people nets more Adv XP and caps. My NW main (made specifically for NW) has made lvl 110 in adv, and 40k+ caps, strictly from NW.
---
Damn!!! That sucks lol. My stash is stuffed full. I had to craft a bunch of ultracite ammo to free up some poundage in my box.
---
Yeah but that‚Äôs not super easy money. The easiest is to rip stuff from FO4 separate it up and charge 100% of its value
---
Thanks. I stopped playing regularly almost 3 months ago now. I log in occasionally to see if anything has been changed, but I haven't seen the changes I need to see, that would make me feel compelled to start playing again.
---
**OK**^Ok^"ok
---
Thank you.
---
That's it! Meanwhile, I still havent gotten anything from the skins section because where are my shotgun skins, yo? Literally any shotgun. I don't care which type. I can make it work! But nope. More tires. Okay, how about the dozens of requests to bring back that tiled floor? Nope. More combat knife skins. Okay, how about something (anything!) clean and new looking? Nah, what we REALLY need is more Free States stuff.
---
Sorry. Still ranting. I just don't understand why all these combat knife skins can't join the ranks of mole miner gauntlets and other useless plans. Are people actually PAYING for these?!?
---
I might give that a shot as well, just for kicks.
---
Finally someone says it. People here are more sensationalist than fucking tabloids.
---
I also don't subscribe to ps+, but it's also a different problem since ps+ games are free and not separate purchases like google stadia plans to do.
---
Pipboy damage of 130k * 0.3 = 39k hit. I‚Äôve hit the queen for that much and it does about half a bar of damage. So... yeah the data miners missed something.
---
Servers are still populated on XB. I know it doesn't do PC players any good, but there's enough of a community between XB/PS to warrant additional content.
---
I don't understand how perk loadouts weren't a thing immediately upon launch. It's the #1 thing everyone in my group universally bitched about.
---
What I do is I get the event and sneak to each creature until I fi d the criptid and if it's not the mothman I server jump and start again.
---
I suppose they're just braver than I am!
---
i honestly dont even think these are real posts anymore, just people trolling
---
i really hope if they have cheats and stuff you can turn them off so you can use the same character. Me and my friends just want to have a pvp server between us
---
Once there was a time where you could build like you wanted and even static objects would be removed if you placed an item. (You could even scrap those objects for resources...) Then the excessive glitch building took hold. Beth countered by restricting placements and stopped the object removal.
---
nine
---
Haha. Can't even say my name right. You know what, stick with Jenn. Should be easier for you. üëç
---
I‚Äôve hit the queen for over 35k in one bloodied meathook power attack. Does 1/3 to 1/2 bar of damage. The data miners have missed a factor or mechanic.
---
Wholesome
---
Hey Man, they are great for sneaking and sniping. They don't work for mobs if you want to tank them. Rifleman perks, batteries included form ammo wight (also works on fusion cores)  and covert operative for the sneaking extra damage.  You got to think of it as a one shot weapon, sneaking and headshoting, you can prime it too and only use prime ammo, it takes red fluxes and it doesn't use much ammo cos of the slow fire rate. You are going to need a blooded or an instigating, if you don't want to go bloodied Instigating is the way to go. Either way you are going to need a secondary weapon for facing mobs. Good luck. Cheers.
---
Not this time, i really want to know if it's worth getting the game, because the game has a rating of 40% and I want to know if they have improved the game by alot since the release
---
how is paying for servers ridiculous? if you cant host your own then yeah they should give you that option to use a pc to host a server but other than that it is 100% reasonable to pay for something that comes out of their hardware and time, a server that they host and maintenance.
---
and post DELETED IN 1. 2. ...
---
junkie maybe? I'm not a bloody guy
---
Is $50 appropriate for bank and storage convenience or is that too much?
---
If you are running out of food or breaking your weapons a lot, you aren't hunting for food or scrap frequently enough, and repair stations/cooking stations are literally everywhere.
---
Paying real money for those things is embarrassing, because you are paying for shortcuts that are unnecessary.
---
Maybe have a special ‚ÄúPA Unarmed‚Äù that hits harder than normal unharmed? Power Armor is essentially a walking tank. Getting punched by one can‚Äôt feel good.
---
I just wish I could actually use the combat armor camo skin I purchased, it doesn't give the option to currently craft it. 
---
That and I'd like to see outfit only variations of the casual underarmor. I'm talking about you Country Girl Underarmor.
---
Random number generator
---
Ran through 150 in about 20 minutes just selling what I picked up yesterday after I'd run through 150. Grinding to earn cool items is fine by me; not really happy with having to grind to get of them as well.
---
What would be cool is having an option of when doing scrip you could have option to turn them in for atom shop points.
---
I just pre-ordered it this morning! I'm hoping it will be fun.
---
That‚Äôs some dedication there. I just pray first place I check it‚Äôs the cryptid so I can get my scrip and get out of there. Good idea to get those daily challenges with the Mothman.
---
The second T-shaped one was really cool! I'm only level 26 so I still need to learn a lot of the building plans but I like watching these for inspiration.
---
Cheating is already off the rails on PC so who really cares at this point? Bethesda has done 0 to combat cheating.
---
I'm actually pretty satisfied with the bug quality in 76, it's a vast improvement over how 4 and skyrim were on launch. Game-breaking updates, on the other hand, oh my god have they screwed the pooch on that. I'll probably still get skyrim, but only *after* the creationkit is released, IF they bother releasing it to the public and don't limit it to CC makers-only. It honestly wouldn't even phase me at this point.
---
Could you post the actual file for this? Id love to read the whole thing and Im having trouble reading the one you have up now :-)
---
Do you swap in the Commando perks for the Handmade? 
---
I'm also a stealthy sniper build, and I currently use an Instigating Lever Action as my main weapon with a semi-auto Furious Handmade as my back-up weapon. The LAR is amazing single-shot damage, but obviously suffers if I'm not killing things in one hit.
---
So I've been debating if I want to swap around from a Rifleman build to a Commando build, and use the Furious Handmade as my primary weapon.
---
If you click the blue link ‚Äúbrochure‚Äù, it will the the original image
---
Also the red shag carpet floors. I get so jealous when I see it in other peoples camps.
---
Go with the aae. The explosive splash damage negates the furious effect if it hits the ground or another enemy. Would work better on larger targets maybe.
---
I guess that some of those types want to farm as much as possible within a set time frame. Farming is more effective with an overpowered weapon.
---
Yes everyone is well aware modders have been cleaning up after Bethesda for years now.
---
That has happened a few times no change, cleard coaches and nothing.  My character also showed blooded bones through skin and what appears to be brain goo stuck to shoes.. Changed outfits in and out of power armor doesn't change it.   It was funny at first but now making it hard to play
---
It says 163 and thats without it equipped and no addictions
---
Right, and holding a Bobby pins to pick a lock! I just want to use my meat hook while in PA.
---
The best thing I got was a Bloodied +40% Power Attack Damage Mole Miner Gauntlet, which would be great except it's identical to the one I already have. üòÇ
---
Good for the alt though, I guess.
---
I got some crap but two pretty good ones. My only complaint is that we can‚Äôt 
---
 select by weapon type. I get a lot of heavy guns and pistols but I don‚Äôt use them.
---
Not sure, don't mess with my .ini but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say no. Buddy of mine had something else minor changed in the .ini and wouldnt let him play either
---
Thank you üëç
---
Suicide, not getting killed. Step on a grenade or go cliff jumping .)
---
And yet the Chainsaw is a Slow weapon, that has a V-Fast attack. Fun.
---
 Just put it back like it was, and let us over repair em' to decent numbers.
---
cool.  
---
I forgot fireproof - it'll help protect you during SB sonic attacks, explosions, and molotovs.
---
Since your strength is midgrade, consider a few mods to power armor.
---
I use motion assist servos (+2 str) and optimized bracers (+str in unarmed).  Targeting HUD hilights enemies, so you can sell all those berry mentats :)
---
Marsupial boosts strength, but you take a hit on intelligence.  Personally, I haven't noticed a difference in Intel related abilities, but YMMV.
---
I got a few things for my scripperoonies, BERW 10mm Submachine Gun, FE+1P Lever Action, EE-V Revolver. Neat stuff. Most of what you get is crap, but if you get one thing it's worth it
---
I don‚Äôt really know what a good price is. How isn‚Äôt good for dps though?
---
I am very impressed.  Looks great!
---
It's the white tuxedo from the Tuxedo pack that was released around New Year's. It went away from the atom shop in the spring, but it will likely come back for the holidays again.
---
A quest to make Nuka-Cranberry! It's mentioned somewhere in a note I picked up!
---
Nice, glad to have you back üëç
---
What's this convo supposed to prove?
---
 It was always good.
---
It was incredible at launch, and even more so now.
---
Proof?
---
1. That we were going to trade,
---
2. We met up,
---
3. I literally messaged him after the fact (it's in the fuckin screenshot) of me calling him out. He logged off as soon as he took the jumpsuit, never put up the gun
---
It is easier for me. I have fat lips and some words are easier than other. All of me is fat ok.
---
I ended up putting all my plans on sale for 5-15caps.
---
That helped.
---
Zealots weapons, wood armor, -mutant damage armor. I was so hopeful and nothing. Used up my 150 script returning pieces and now can't play until tomorrow to get rid of all the useless 20lb guns that has me overweight. üôÅ
---
Massive lag
---
fallout + borderlands
---
Not terrible weapons that 2 pound of weight could be used for more bullets
---
You say skill, yet my levels have been earned through being a pansy, hiding in hard to reach areas, getting marine armor and a gauss rifle, and popping every chem I get and my stealth boy when I make it into the final zone. My first victory was a cheap on. My teammate dies because of a stealth boy'd frog leg user. He gets radiated by a extra crispy scorchbeast and runs into the building in third person hoping to spot me hiding. I get him twice in the chest and he goes to melee. He misses me and I catch him in the back of the head.
---
Fucking pipe pistols...
---
If it gives you the best chance of getting the rarest reward from the event then it's the intended action for the event. Bethesda didn't "intend" for everyone to stand around staring at an enemy for a third if the event waiting for everyone to find it and shoot it.
---
thats a really good number.  Its better than most of my swords, and right up there with some 2H weapons.
---
If you aren't overencumbered and have some decent armor, that would be a keeper.
---
Please!! It came out before I got the game and I NEED it. :(
---
Yes. We‚Äôre a big happy Connor family.
---
I'm pretty sure that at least one vault dweller would have dyed a vault suite when given the chance.
---
I assume you mean black powder rifle and pistol, or are they some special kind to complement your white power jumpsuit ;-) joking aside, I also got some odds and ends. best scrip haul to date, but still pretty 'meh' stuff and except an unyielding scout chest piece I didnt feel like keeping anything really. And thats about 2500 scrip. sigh.
---
at least you can get melee weapons with swing speed now, pulled 4 in a row, unfortunately mutants and troubleshooter :-(
---
I never said it wasnt guy said they werent pay to win i gave a scenerio where they are
---
As a PC player, I am expecting them to break the mod and provide less of the functionality but hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised.
---
If you get a quad explosive harpoon, hit me up!
---
It's weird how slow these devs are at overhauling weapon balance. How damn hard can it be to just buff the shit weapons a bit so we can have some variety? Especially now that Wastelanders is delayed, we really need to see some corrections to the weapon balance situation.
---
I'll have exactly 1 cram on me.
---
Whitesprings is actually modeled after the Greenbriar.
---
The bunker actually exists IRL.  You just cant buy power armor plans there IRL.
---
Only good thing i got was a bloodied power attack +1agility shovel
---
No such luck!
---
and space backpack skin, also atomic shop.
---
Yup.
---
If i was using the perk for armor penetration I would go 2 shot. If I wasn't using the perk I would go anti armor. 
---
I'm not really a big fan of the 2 shot weapons so I tend to just sell them after I've given them a try.
---
&gt; This community is one of the most toxic entitled one I've ever seen in gaming.
---
 
---
I don't think asking for all gameplay to be inside the fully priced game is a particularly entitled perspective. I don't need it, just won't play if they continue down this path.
---
No it isn't!
---
There was a picture from an Atomic Shop datamine that showed an alternate pattern of the same tiles in use. It wasn't the item showcased, but was part of the background.
---
Which perk in particular?
---
My wife wanted the bot because he's funny, so I got her the bot. I have one too. I don't necessarily agree with Bethesda on where the shop is headed but I don't don't feel like I have an advantage over other players either. Its more or less the insecurity of how far Bethesda is going to take it that I'm worried about.
---
The truth is you are the minority of the player base without a scrap bot and that's absolutely fine. I dig it. But taking it out on other players is just as bad for the game, if not worse than a bot that gives you 8 pieces scrap here and there.
---
If you *really* want to boycott the Atom Shop then stop playing the game. That's what I did with WoW.
---
So carry RadAway, or loot one of the mole miners and use a non legendary shotgun. 
---
Or you can continue being antisocial and nuke down everything, pissing the rest of the event off. 
---
Your choice.
---
I side with the super mutants, ghouls, and scorched. If society didn't work before why should it work now? Anarchy and bloodshed will rein supreme.
---
I got one a while back and LOVE it
---
I looked at the 19 minute gameplay footage and was turned off from it.
---
Tormenter will help keep you alive from melee fools
---
We've established that yes, yes it is.
---
Stabalized.
---
Go with the AA if you dont use PA.
---
I saved my script to 1000 and was so excited. Well the lead up was the best part. Walked away with 20 junk weapons lol. Oh well, such is life in the wasteland
---
This is also why I keep playing, and also what I wish Bethesda would have leaned into a little more with 76, and the life simulation aspect is what I hope they lean more into with Starfield and Elder Scrolls VI moving forward, and less of the gamey loot-shoot fest Fallout 4 and 76 feature more heavily. I want to feel like I‚Äôm living another life in another world, not like I‚Äôm playing a game and wrestling against RNG for loot.
---
The mod is pretty fantastic.  I hope the author makes a version compatible with Bethesda's changes if Bethesda's version has any shortcomings.
---
Can't remember the name off the bat. But it's in Intelegance and ignores armor for heavy weapons if you are in power armor.
---
Slugger, Master Slugger, and Inscisor are good
---
That fletchettes mod is insanity!
---
It's RED-EYEEEEE
---
Ok, thank you
---
Ok thanks a bunch
---
I'm sick of this, all of you shut up!
---
I pre-ordered months ago and am so excited
---
Did i read that wrong. You have to purchase the "service" of private servers. And it won't be modable at launch. Guess ima have to go tell my wife we can't play yet.
---
&gt;where we instantly downvote someone for stating facts, just because they dont correspond with our own opinion.
---
Who really knows why people downvote, I wouldn't read too much into it. Any gameplay item sold in a paid game store does not mesh with my view on a good direction of the game. I don't know why this is an edgy take or I need to further elaborate.
---
I run a junkies build. Best melee for max dmg would be the gauntlets/super sledges/grog axe's stuff like that. Get the base dmg &amp; add 50% &amp; that's where it would be dmg wise without the perk card's/strength build. Death tambo for me personally is for collecting/hoarding, not so much for it's high dps. If we were talking bloodied, then he'll yeah, dmg through the roof! Ide probably  use it when farming low lvl areas where the enemies are easy to kill.
---
Post your build, and what you currently use.  Then we can take a look and offer some advice.
---
Without anything to go on.  I would recommend Incisor and Bloody Mess without anything else to go on.
---
I assume you already have Slugger, Expert and Master.
---
I'll give it a go..  But dieing is dieing one way or another,   nothing beats killing yourself with a good old orbital LOL
---
Ok thank you
---
Feel your pain and just to add insult to injury it always dishes out junk weapons that weigh a ton!üôà
---
But you can somehow fit this huge hand into a gun's trigger guard.
---
they caught you at work huh
---
There was some hype because a video was released of a datamined tunnel system called ‚Äúmole miner city.‚Äù But it‚Äôs just a test cell that has been in the game files since beta.
---
You can search the video on YouTube.
---
i'm sure they are gonna sell an atom shop item for that  
---
create the problem sell the solution
---
Listen man, you can't just go [welding random crap](https://external-preview.redd.it/D2-Yc2HxLuMrKL0EAWzZsaHa8mJK4Dn4wHvFI0MyDLk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f0fbd5a07511ab3c6901685b8928e658a60c3e05) to power armor and expect it to still work. That would just be too silly for this game :p
---
I enjoy just wandering the roads.
---
This is true.
---
I guess you could call it a "me" problem. But there's alotta folks that enjoy pistols builds . Yes all builds have some sort of compromise. But I seems pistols make the most. I mean pistol builds are still very viable ,my main does pretty well and can kill just about anything aside from then queen on his own. Just dunno why they have agility so stacked against the guns it focuses around and tan go an cater to other builds like rifles and melee.
---
Then you be the one to initiate.  Or leverage my advice when seeking revenge.
---
So your response is a bit disingenuous...
---
People buy shovels
---
&gt; as long as they don't cross the line and start selling weapons and armor in the Atom shop.
---
This is exactly how people justified cosmetics as well. "As long as they only sell cosmetics and don't start selling anything that affects gameplay". Really bums me out, how willing we are to shift perspective on this stuff.
---
Should have bought 2 star if buying ranged.  None of the 3 star effects are worth doubling the scrip price.
---
&gt;But instead, the base game one year later is lacking, and the rewards in particular have barely improved or increased. So of course when the devs release a beepbort robot everyone wants one. They've been starving us for this type of thing for months.
---
Nailed it.
---
Yep. I was pumped to get back into this game. Never mind then.
---
What‚Äôs ur gamertag?
---
Wow reading twitter is worse then here. Fucking twat calling pete a liar. What's wrong with kids these days?
---
My friend was saying this as well, would make for an interesting attire.
---
I don‚Äôt think either of those events were really ‚Äúgood.‚Äù The appeal is that they are limited time only so they get a lot of players in one area with a chance to get unique rewards. Other than that the events aren‚Äôt difficult at all and pretty cheesy.
---
I want to make a habit of not fast traveling anymore next time I log in. I also want to see how it feels without in game music with the exception of the radio.
---
Because it's to deter the super-farmers. Guys like me who play a couple hours a week don't come anywhere near that limit, unless I save a couple weeks worth of 1 stars.
---
I tend to place them in mute. I play a game every time Bethesda or Fallout or someone posts, in how many haters do I mute this time?
---
The fridge is terrible because you can't put dead bodies in it. They should have a Gourmand version that allows you to store your latest kill for later.
---
&gt;Bethesda really have gone to shit.
---
lol they really hit a nerve huh?
---
I don't know what people were expecting.  You might get one good legendary per thousand you find or buy at the purveyor.  
---
I'm sure many will get some decent items but if you tallied every last drop in a spreadsheet when this sale is done I'm confident 99.5% of it is trash.
---
most people that one shot stuff are running bloodied,  thats where the rad away comes in.
---
It's simple economics. If daily scrip was unlimited:
---
A 3\* legendary ranged weapon costs 100 scrip. If you don't like the roll (95% chance), you can immediately turn it into 40 scrip. Which can be used to buy a new 3\* ranged weapon for 100 scrip. Thus effectively dropping the price of 3\* ranged weapons down to 60 scrip.
---
This is not Bethesda's goal. They priced the items as intended and don't want to water down those prices. The alternative would be to reduce the amount of scrip you get for exchanging a legendary, but at the end of the day Bethesda will balance it out how they want.
---
The only plans I dont put up are mole miner gauntlets and mr handy stuff.
---
There are some folks who've done the math and AA does _slightly_ more damage than the TS (this goes for all ballistic weapons not just 50 cal). Reason being, the AA ignores 50% of armor meaning it does about 130% base damage and the TS does about 125% base damage.
---
But that's not the only reason to prefer the AA. The other reason is that the AA is more reliable and consistent than the TS. The AA will always ignore 50% of armor.  Always.  But the TS, instead of firing one shot that does 125% damage fires two shots that do 62.5% base damage each - one of which is highly accurate and one of which is highly inaccurate,  meaning at least some of the time you're doing ~62% the damage of a stock 50 cal, and that's not optimal. Not for me at least.  So I'd stick with the more reliable weapon that does more consistent and heavier damage.
---
It's always awesome seeing positive stories about stuff like this. It makes me want to soup up my haunted house now lol.
---
Well I think they limit the good stuff, fiber, screws, lead, steel etc. because people would cry that it‚Äôs pay to win I‚Äôm sure. Mine is the same way. A bunch of rubber and concrete!

Finished the event around 30 times over the last 2 weeks and got 2 fixer plans (took maybe 20 for the first)
---
Ditto.  
---
I honestly find the game a bit unplayable without it. Four characters with multiple load outs for different weapons and utility functions...that gets crazy doing by hand.
---
[](/flutterbrow)
---
Counterpoint your last phrase - A melee PA build is, for the most part, viable.  (I say that b/c its my build).  I use a vampire switch blade as primary an a Gutter as secondary.  
---
@L145, a PA/melee build 'weakness' is against things that fly.  For those, I do switch to something ballistic - you can't take down a strategic cargobot with a knife, and you'd have to rely on another player to ground an SB, unless you use a ballistic to knock it down, then swap to a melee weapon to take it out.   (I've done both)  
---
Running solo, it's just as easy to stay ballistic to kill it.
---
The secondary "weakness" is entirely on me, in that I generally do not consume drugs, bobbleheads, etc, which keeps some of my damage numbers low - although even drug free, the gutter will do over 1000 dmg on a power attack.
---
A weapon quite literally nobody uses because you can just use a combat knife instead.
---
 I've been playing since the beta. It was always fine, buggy for sure but its a Bethesda game. ;)
---
Been doing various forms of digital graphic design as a living for a long time. I have been trying to learn more 3D skills in the past couple years though.
---
I still have mine.  It looks great hanging on the wall above my ammo bench.
---
Thats true
---
Not sure if they count but most world spawn items apparently have a loot limit before they respawn.
---
If it was a single spawn on the server you may as well hop to a different server.
---
I kind of do this and it pretty much has become my second life lol
---
I wander the wastes on foot (No fast travelling other than nuka shine)  and have done for over 10 months. I've played almost every day since launch for approx 1-4hrs (1107ish hrs).

So it's not only a apoc life it's also a walking simulator lol
---
It doesn't bother me too bad anymore but yeah when I was playing actively like it was strictly a looter shooter, I was a little annoyed by the low chance RNG system which always felt like it was against you.
---
I am Lvl 97 now and I like to think of playing it like a life simulator as my retirement for getting to this point lol.
---
at some point they broke them so hard they suck even as bloodied now
---
Yeah, I sold my Troubleshooter's RW shovel for a decent amount.

Wastelander,

You seem to have had too much exposure to radiation.  It has impeded your mental capacities.  Come to New Gad for treatment, we will help you become well again.

There's a line between buggy and broken. And they sprinted across it. It was "technically" playable. Sometimes. Assuming the quest you were on worked.
---
OK I thought he was saying "mor junk for the *drunk*" - so it makes a lot more sense now
---
I've sold over a dozen on PS4 since they made this change, all my caps are spent on more keycards. This last run yielded me ZERO, and my group had about six runs this week. So I haven't been able to re-up on keycards because the caps dried up. Gotta sell some stuff, you traders on the main trading sub be looking out for my WTS posts maybe? My buyer list is huge lol, honestly makes me think they're worth more than 15k now
---
Yeah so what
---
Someone post a pic!
---
Good idea OP
---
Rolling pins, combat knifes and pitch forks

The fridge is great and you're a pyscho.
---
Lol FUCK RDO. People say it's not a stupid grind like GTAO are delusional... Granted, if you liked GTAO, I see how you'd enjoy RDO
---
No, its an online only game.
---
If you want to play offline, you can play Fallout 4.  76 is online.
---
And what's with all those robot vendors that don't accept human flesh as tender.
---
This is based on assumptions not yet proven. By modding the servers, it means you'll most probably be able to tweak some parameters in the future - far-fetched example would be to level-lock whole map above level 60.
---
There will be multiple people deciding to host their servers, or network of servers. I plan to rent at least two. Other players will be able to connect to those servers. As a result, if you are PvE, you'll be able to find pacifist servers, and if you are PvP, you'll be able to find servers where there's no pacifism permitted.
---
I enjoy it just for fucking around, personally. Hop on with some friends and goof off. I'm more excited for ToW though.
---
Uncle Todd does not approve.
---
Dude, there is so much speculation and unverified info in this post its unreal.
---
People really have to get this idea out of their head that servers have different spawn rates, different purveyor rewards, etc.
---
Wait what does ffr stand for? And I would be willing to accept the handmade rifle. I play on PC. I can add you here in a little bit.
---
Not for things you don‚Äôt have all the ingredients for.
---
A few of the quests are 100% geared to multiple players.  I don't think trying to solo the sbq, project paradise, encryptid, or vault 94 expert runs would be fun exactly.  More like frustrating and completely revolving around a very specific gear set to metagame your way around the challenges.  
---
This game was intended to be played with others and imo it's best in a team.
---
And snot ear.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the hat you get from encrypted

I‚Äôve got both, let me know if you want me to put them in your camp (PC)

The cosmetic system is broken.  Very few good skins and never for a weapon or armor I use.
---
don't forget waterbird diseases
---
Can't have 10% and 25% on the same weapon
---
I never knew that! I love that I can still learn new things about this game.
---
Yeah I want to pin a recipe that I don‚Äôt have all the ingredients for. Scorchbeast mixed stew is near the bottom of the list and takes a lot of ingredients. I want to quickly track what I have or don‚Äôt.
---
Yes, but only for scrip purposes. It doesn't matter what effect, and only for 100 caps or so.
---
I can give you crabs
---
Or as they call it, ‚ÄúNukular‚Äù
---
Gotcha. Yes, that would be nice.
---
It's yours, no cost. I'm not on right now but message me on live and I'll get on.
---
Thank you I took your advice and joined an encrypted event... Can't get more suicidal than meleing that sucker several deaths later and so far so good...  Phew it even cleared the brains off my shoe lol
---
I would upgrade it best you can to include armor. Combat Armor with plans can be changed to BOS which makes that piece a whole lot better. Make it ultra-lightweight for AP bonus and yes it will sell.
---
Hells ya !  My level 2 mule is armed with a wickid level 1 be pipe revolver with fast reload.   Would love a nasty level 1 bloodied or aa swingspeed machete maybe.   Also level 1 haz suits are something i collect.
---
I was using a bloodied 1* gauss before I got my 3*** version
---
Want the Fatman?
---
Interesting, so either she has twice the supposed health, 85% damage ignore, or there is an absolute cap of 16k damage she (or any other mob) can receive in one hit. 
---
Would it be possible if you buffed yourself to do only 20-24k damage per hit and see if you still get half health bar or proportionally smaller chunk?
---
wait a minute, are they going to release this in next week?
---
Would you be able to hop on right now? My gt is DecidedHorse326
---
The most expensive one star I bought was 3k and the was because it was a quad Tesla which sells for 15k+
---
Check YouTube, someone had previously posted about doing just this, there may be a vid on it.

As someone who uses nocturnal sniping weapons regularly, this would be very handy to have around camp as a visual reminder.
---
Wait...so even if you power down your Vending Machine people can still buy from it?
---
Also I have a 1 star blooded gat plas I got a 10k offer on. So one stars ya!
---
Correct. Powering down only hides your location on the map. People still have full access to buy items.
---
yes
---
Faster Fire Rate. Sure, I'm NA-West so won't be on for a good 7 hours from now
---
thank you for the tip, I hate nuclear winter mode but i will use this to get the cosmetics.
---
sure, effects like bolstering, vanguard, instigating, bloodied etc are good on there own if the price is okey
---
Why?
---
pretty sure there is a toggle for all the stuffs and only stuffs you can craft now..
---
as well as filters for food, drinks, healing.. in the food filter there is meat and plants
---
Most people would be dead or dead after a few months. Overwhelming majority of people need a match to light a fire and have no idea how to filter and clean water... those two items right there alone will change everything in a few weeks in reality.
---
Also. A 1 star bloodied deathclaw gauntlet will do pretty much the same damage as a swingspeed one per hit, it‚Äôll just hit slower.  Talkin 1500 damage a swipe. That‚Äôs useful!
---
I have mine in a separate room for just that reason. I then shut my machines off and turn the door leading to them into a solid wall, which prevents anyone from getting to them.
---
Will try that when the power is back in 2.5 hours. I already remapped aim and fire and it still does it. Re installed the receiver drivers as well. Still does it. Have the game on a different PC and it doesn't have this issue.
---
It‚Äôll have less bugs on release  than Fallout76 does a full year in. Just sayin‚Äô
---
I don't think he meant that, it's just the way he phrased it.
---
Both secondary effects
---
Also remember that some people also want to farm the weapons, materials(tons of lead and decent amounts of steel, aluminum, gears, and black titanium), and glowing meat.  Even Exp.  It's the best place to knock out your daily cap limit at the train station afterwards.
---
Especially if there are lower level players, it doesn't help to one-shot even the regular mole miners unless they're already wailing on an extractor.  I sometimes see players, when most of the spawns show up from the main mining tunnel, just pumping automatic weapons through the doorway, mowing down mole miners before other player can even get a shot on them.
---
The legendaries are obviously the top-priority takeaway here, but for anybody who plays clean-up with the rest of the mole miners, try to be mindful and leave some space for others to tap a few.
---
I got four fixers, two of which were pretty good. A few bloodied including a handmade. Nothing exceptional though.
---
Good idea yes, but Uncle Todd does what he wants.
---
Yes, and no, and yes, and no... also yes, oh and no.  So yes and no.
---
Okay. I'll be on in 7 hours so I guess we can get that done then.
---
Thanks for that, I didnt know. People to raid with are becoming scarce.
---
because 10% damage while aiming and FFR are both effects that only come as a secondary effect therefore they cant both be on the same weapon
---
I feel the same.  Everyone is always talking about Endgame and I'm like, "Endgame?  What endgame?"
---
Add sneak damage to that and it‚Äôs just silly.

Yeah.  If everyone who believes they can survive an apocalypse actually could then it wouldn't be much of an apocalypse.

It was a design decision to limit power creep.
---
You don't need packing light, you don't need Renegade.
---
you are still able to drop them
---
Also the switch to the machine is in a completely separate room with my generators, and connected to the vending machines via conduit and can only be accessed by me. My generator room is also walled off and not able to be accessed except by me.

they can still be dropped on the frame, wasn‚Äôt fixed yet

Yeah, but nothing memorable.

See, I expect to see more server customization. We'll have communities spring up around role playing, others spring up around specific streamers, etc, etc. I think it will be good for solo players, I think it'll be good for very active multiplayer lovers, but for the filthy casuals like myself I still expect to see a reduction in player counts.
---
That's sorta the common thing with FO76. This is 72 different games to the community at large. You play mostly solo, and frankly, so do I. However, I get a rush out of seeing most of the server show up for a SBQ battle or Meat Cook, etc, etc. I play with my spouse, 2 xboxes in the same house no need for a mic, no extra people in our group. I'm with you on not wanting my immersion busted up, but at the end game there isn't any immersion to enjoy anymore.
---
I'm all for everyone enjoying the game in their own way, not one to yuck someone's yum or anything. I think private servers are a good addition and I'm looking forward to them... But I do still believe the general public game servers will suffer as a result.
---
I get that a lot but also with Super Mutants
---
The soundtrack is good, but boy is it loud. I have my TV on a pretty low setting and I can hear it in my kitchen at times
---
NO! I like being one of the only players with that.  
---
It looks fantastic and I get compliments all the time.
---
heavy gunner,

bloody mess,

By the way, that's something I wanted to know. If I max out a card. Can't I get more of that card at a lower rank. For example let's say I wanted rifleman at lv 3 for some situations but also a lv 2 for others. Can't I keep getting a maxed out card and level up a second instance of it?
---
If you can easily kill Scorchbeasts they're pretty expy. I found during the "cleansing Appalachia" that if you killed like 20 of them you'd be pretty close to leveling. Plus all the Scorched around them.
---
Heavy weapons perks. 
---
Heavy Gunner, Bullet Shield, Lock and Load, Stabalized.

And any non specific stuff like bloody mess, tenderizer, ect.
---
No damnit I said I would
---
What time zone are you? I've not done a raid but would give it a go, lvl 210 non pa heavy gunner
---
That‚Äôs actually a good point. The retired list is essentially the same thing as the MVP list.
---
GT is Badgerist
---
I would keep it but i‚Äôm really keen on power armor and don‚Äôg have all that many caps so i‚Äôm just looking to get rid of it. I also have an instigating deathclaw gauntlet which I use out of power armor but its 1 star.
---
I had a bloodied ripper back when you could improve melee weapons damage by repairing to 200%. On 1HP, I was doing almost 300 DPS.
---
And then they removed the 200% damage increase thing and it became absolutely useless. :(
---
Don't forget about pie
---
And while you have your shovel out... There's another body that need burying.
---
So, you want your own version of a suit that people got STUCK in?
---
Well I mean great for you to enjoy your experience but you're just straight up delusional if you think that's what the majority of people enjoy. Also, it is kind of a disappointment since this was never the idea of the game. This post would make sense if the idea of the game/franchise was always a "cathartic" experience, but it was never meant to be it, fallout games have always given a thrilling experience, and more so it should be on a "survival" game, but it just happened because of the lack of things to do and because the ridiculously low difficulty. So, like again, great for you, but you got to admit that the game is just not fun for the majority of people and you shouldn't make it sound like it is.
---
If they came out with a really well made Xo1 enclave skin I would buy it so fast and I would start using PA again
---
what platform are you on?
---
They‚Äôre probably ghouls. They‚Äôre pre-War people that got stuck in their suits.
---
Not really, just make it so a unoficcial character can't login an official server.
---
&gt; so it's more than fair they get compensation for it
---
You already paid for it.
---
&gt; and therefore a luxury
---
Its a "luxury" that other games provide without asking for extra money.
---
&gt;Anything you get there can only be accessed there, but then you have issues such as bullets, and caps.
---
What.
---
Build a closed garage, keep them there.
---
It's based on /r/DestinyTheGame's Bungie Plz, which has been wildly successful :)
---
Yes. This.
---
Thanks for the info
---
True, don't intend to run them, but it gives a viable path for people who would like to ,to be able to without giving up vats or damage perks
---
Are there mods for the bone club? I had no idea
---
Sorry, I should have specified suit only!  :3
---
They wouldn't need to use the purveyor if they could dupe their weapons. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It's not a bad idea. It's bad marketing, because it would make the game itself more enjoyable and decrease the feeling of "I need to improve my experience" which leads people to make Atom Shop purchases.
---
They should just get rid if the limit.
---
Yes, 3rd is 250 dr while reloading.  Awesome to know, thanks!
---
thnx for the workaround.  it's tough being solo for a year in a online game
---
might have missed something but if you have these (supressor and tenderizer i personally wouldnt bother with) you should be doing just fine
---
You could lock them behind levels like they currently are. Like can't get past rank 2 untill  level 20, 3 at 30, 4 at 40 , 5 at 50 or something along those lines. Don't think it would be that complicated
---
Lots of cannons. I seem to be cursed with getting crappy heavy legendaries when I'm overencumbered and out of scrip for the day.
---
Dont be a solo player there's plenty of groups that would help ya out
---
 Your Mileage May Vary.
---
yut been trying all day
---
So you know how mobile games only let you fo a little bit each day so that you have to keep going back to it everday or get the dreaded fomo (fear of missing out.) That is what is going on here, you are being manipulated.  
---
Someone correct me if I'm wrong here but didn't bethesda Austin specialize in mobile games before starting on 76? I remember hearing that in the noclip doc but I could be wrong.
---
Loot world items. 150-250 junk items. Not drops from enemies actual world items like abraxo boxes etc.
---
Starting over is fun due to the fact that you have more knowledge now and you can complete the story better the most OP builds right now are heavy weapons commando builds and melee builds i was melee build and I restarted from scratch to a commando and I have a good time now just make sure to transfer your stuff over and don‚Äôt delete it so you can use it as a mule to store stuff
---
I‚Äôve put them in the greenhouse,lock doors and turn power off.works verry well if ur in time...last week i was @20k caps and someone buys my BE combat shotgun i had for sale for 25k(have a sign says pm offers)gues he dont need no offer.15k caps gone...
---
Rolling a new toon is incredibly fun. I honestly don't know how people can go on playing only one.
---
Cinema 4D, Octane, Substance Painter
---
I think that this scavenger should have been free to everyone.
---
Yeah. The other day I was working very hard to try to get good results out of Project Paradise. I was able to help get at least 20 feed in each of the three zones. However, I single-handedly protected the wolf in Zone A and, right before the Alpha Sheepsquatch showed up, we still had 3 animals alive.  I really wanted the bear arm mod plans so I wanted to kill the Alpha quickly as to complete the event. When it showed up I was still alone and I took it out in less than 10 seconds with my Junkie's LMG. Anyway, about 1 or 2 minutes later another player came over, saw the dead Sheepsquatch, and gave me the thumbs down. Oh well, can't win them all.
---
Alright. From anywhere or just the Asylum?
---
@sandmanhimself in your videos I see you go hidden in plain view of dudes and land sneak attacks.  I'm wondering if there is any rhyme or reason to it in PvP or if its just my PER roll vs your sneak roll.
---
play different like suggested.  you aren't trying to fight here, only hide.  get some dark gear like the black fishing slicker and black trucker hat.  hide hide hide read a book while you wait.
---
They use the purveyor to get new unduped (or nearly unduped) weapons and armor. Duping your own weapons and armor limits you to only your own weapons and armor. By using the purveyor, you would be able to obtain very different weapons and legendary effects. They would dupe an armor piece with zero weight in order to obtain scrip for those new weapons, defeating the purpose of farming legendaries. Lets be real, it gonna be a lot easier to set a scrip limit rather than fix the all duping exploits and not introduce new ones
---
It may be a pessimistic prediction, but I somehow suspect it will be like this:
---
* Private servers are essentially just adventure mode, with the soft cap on the player population reduced from 24 to 1 (friends/teammates can still join the player).
---
* For the above reason, it is still just a random world, and there are no special gameplay settings or customization. All that is there is shown on the picture in the Inside the Vault, you choose "private world" just like survival mode in the past, and that is about it.
---
* Characters can freely be moved back and forth between shared and private worlds, similarly to the old survival mode.
---
Hopefully it is more advanced than that, but the above seems to be the easiest/cheapest way to implement it, and it is consistent with the apparent design principle of not wanting to ever force the player to create a new character.
---
Anywhere.
---
Massively improved, I posted a reply earlier, but noticed you didn't seem to take interest in it lol
---
long time since I did asylum outfit runs. I made tables to track the frequency of the spawns. Sometimes I got all 3, some 2 and 1 and could even get several dry 0 runs in a row. I concluded that it was random how many you'd get (unless you picked up from each spawn in which case that one would be burned). I never got spawns on all three all the time, felt random to me.
---
Pretty much I just do the daily/weekly stuff for atoms, and run spots that have legendaries. I can normally fill an hour or two doing that. Then a bit of NW, then on to other things.
---
Bloodied and instigating i gues
---
I would suggest starting over.  Its refreshing and you don't have to deal with trying to sort out a stash full of stuff that you don't know is good or bad anymore, or what.
---
My understanding is that players can't destroy other players' bases anymore, and though power armor is still popular it doesn't seem as popular as it once was.  Unfortunately, you still need a way to avoid rads in nuke zones, and the only options are power armor, or hazmat suits which you can't wear with armor sooo..
---
Your monitor doesnt stop servers from crashing, enemies not spawning / are invincible, quest chains breaking, water not loading, power armor breaking etc etc. And that's just stuff I personally encountered in the first month. After getting kicked from the server and losing our progress again my girl asked me "are we even having fun?" No.
---
Heavy gunner perks will work with it, demo expert will not
---
Well my rate change was super noticeable, and consistent. I was landing all 3 each time until a few days ago. Then suddenly I was getting one outfit in the same spot each time and sometimes not even that was there.
---
Servers aren't going to be moddable right away, so I suspect a few weeks before anything like this happens.  We also don't know to what extent they'll be moddable...probably pretty basic at first, though a perma death one would seem like an option that should be available right away.
---
seriously, does this reset the cooldown? never knew this.
---
you wouldnt happen to know what happens if you spawn an outfit with one char, and have another on another account come and pick it up?
---
Good to know, thanks for the info.
---
That's my prediction as well.
---
Most will be trying to recharge their phones and wonder why they can‚Äôt get a bar...lol
---
Not kidding though, clean water (not a few cases of water) will be a huge factor. Elements even without radiation fears would wipe another portion out. 
---
I look around and know most wouldn‚Äôt be able to do the basics anymore...
---
Very eloquently put. Bethesda has had many opportunities to capitalize on the established lore from previous games. They already retconned the BoS being to far east so why not give us some skins in the Atom Shop. The enclave is a no brainer. Instead we get stupid jump suits, dresses, and mascot uniforms ffs. Very skins I have actually wanted to purchase. Their design department is severely lacking and needs to up their game. This utility Atom Shop bullshit, in my opinion, is P2W at it's finest. You pay either with your card, or your time that it took to grind out those atoms. I purchased the collectron station with my time, not my wallet. If they had better cosmetics, hell yea I'd drop some money on them. As OP has stated the skins are limited to specific armors/under armors and that is just anti-consumerism at it's best. It's 2019 Bethesda, get your heads out of your asses and look at what your succeful competitors are doing.
---
It's very difficult if not impossible to move a base regularly to different types of terrain unless it has just one foundation. If the game didn't force that style of design then you wouldn't see it.
---
Private servers are supposed to come to all platforms
---
Wtf?  Why is this even a thing?
---
Thanks! I do graphic design but my son loves the 3D rendering and has some great skills, I‚Äôm going to show him your pic, great work again! 
---
Be cool to do a whole pre nuclear war version of Appalachia!
---
I'm so jealous
---
I put atomic shop because I know Bethesda won't add this without making a profit from it sadly
---
Interesting. There used to be a time where if someone nearby had Serendipity, everybody nearby would get the notification too. I don't have Serendipity but what if one of the other low health players had it which then projected onto Queen?
---
Oh damn that‚Äôs how to do it! I know I‚Äôm doing when I log in today!!!
---
When I did that, I could just go directly back and find them again.
---
For the majority sure I see the point. Thing is I wasn't trying to speak for the majority. Just sharing my experience. Yeah the game wasn't meant to fully be like what I'm sharing but the elements and mechanics are there so I'm just using it in a way that makes the game enjoyable for me.
---
The problem is that player demand and community feedback for a company is not discussion in places like this. Rather, it is how the players interact with the atom shop and what Bethesda sees bringing them in microtransaction money.
---
And don't forget the punctuation perk.
---
I saw one guy who put them behind the rolling doors.  I could not figure out why and then it hit me later.  If you cant get to them then folks can't buy stuff.  So you just block them off when you don't want to sell for the moment.
---
Right? You'd think Power Armor would have Power Fists built right on there.
---
Sure. The best thing for us consumers would be for them to release the server files so we can host it ourselves.
---
But you know they want that server and mod money.
---
Not to mention, whatever price they ask for server rental its going to be over 2x the cost of the actual rental.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs quite interesting. I can‚Äôt reload though, so when it runs out I bet it‚Äôs going to go back down to 5.
---
I use to until I learned some serum recipes. I crafted a shit ton of them and I pull out 2 a day for a thousand then I sell various chems and such to make up the 400. Maybe should craft some helmets to make up that 400 gap. I did the civil war hats before they fixed it! That was the best ever lol.
---
Dang it! Why do you always win!
---
Yeah, fov changes still let you play NW. I have mine at 95.
---
Watch it works and you get all god-rolls! Haha! That would be hilarious! 
---
We‚Äôll start seeing a line of drunk naked people waiting...lol
---
 I disagree. I only put the PCMR in because so many people have endless problems with their boxen.
---
 There are some PC tweaks that make a big difference to how the game runs, if you are interested. ;)
---
Hopefully they power them down too because being on the map, burning people's fast travel caps, but behind locked doors is really obnoxious.
---
that someone doesn't know the rules on this sub
---
So an increased cap limit by means of a partition?
---
I suppose if each vending machine had an individual cap limit and would shut down once that limit is reached...locking your other items inside...
---
The limit on number of vending machines in a camp would remain...
---
Otherwise you‚Äôre asking for a temporary-but-regular cap limit increase.
---
Where do the caps go if someone buys an item and you're at max  caps?
---
Speaking of which, what happened to Vault 96? I recall from QuakeCon that it was supposed to come soon^TM after Vault 94, without an exact date given. Most likely it had to be prioritized down because of Wastelanders, but now that the expansion is delayed by months anyway, I wonder if there is a chance of Vault 96 being released this year, or if it has been canceled/moved to a date later than that of Wastelanders?
---
Storing sucks because then you have to relist everything. Better to have them in an area you can cut off from the public.
---
Same. I keep getting heavy weapons when all I want is a sniper rifle.
---
My Camp is in the wooded areas near Morgantown. Pretty much in the center so I just pick a daily quest or just decide for example "let's go to the Toxic Valley". Then I travel there. When done doing what I needed, I go back to camp and deposit or sell what I picked up in my travels. It's a slow way of earning money but the XP gains and the Legendary chances, like you said, are quite substantial.
---
Into the void of nothing.
---
That‚Äôs perfectly fine but those players shouldn‚Äôt expect specifically multiplayer based content, like the raids, to be adjusted for them
---
 Quads will do that occasionally.
---
Purified water
---
You can build more than 1
---
Buffout
---
Does the chain lighting effect from the tesla bypass %DR (Sentinel Assassin ect.)?
---
It probably would sell for 1 to 2k I would think. I‚Äôm not sure on how many people use vampires on melee but swing speed makes it good. If someone used Bowie knifes obviously they might take a liking to it. I‚Äôve just had no luck selling vamp melee weapons personally.
---
Buffout, lots of Buffout
---
Should try it just once. I think you will be pleasantly surprised how rewarding it is to wind up with great gear on more than one. Plus most of the great gear that I loot is not applicable to the character I loot it on. I loot a lot of stuff that I know is good but I don't want to let it go. So....I make a new character to use it.
---
Each say diffrent so you will get too manny diffrent answers. Some will say yes its better while others will say run while you can.
---
as a Nuka Cola fanatic, I love this idea.
---
I dont! You were horrible on Jersey shore too!
---
Pepper
---
Oh well XD
---
right? there should be a way to turn them off from within the vendor- not a switch outside and not by removing the power cable.
---
overdrive and fury are usually what I'm hunting.
---
Couldn't agree more.  Fridge too.
---
Psychobuff, weirdly enough. I'm up to my armpits in everything else I use, but I'm always running out of that.
---
Hey man, in a nuclear apocalypse we gotta look out for each other. I'd rather you enjoy it than get the 40 scrip.
---
My kingdom for a pepper mill!
---
I have had two at my camp before
---
Am jealous that you got a JE fixer
---
I can't get it to go to 4K in bordered windowless, it defaults to 2560x1440. No idea why.
---
Based on your comment, the lore of this guy would be that he was an old trader who became ghoulified. However, he didn‚Äôt become completely feral and was able to be composed enough to know how to trade with other people and knows simple fraises like ‚ÄúCoPper FoR SSSteeeL‚Äù, ‚ÄúTHank YoU....‚Äù and do on and so forth, basically talking like a scorched with better grammar skills.
---
I just started going straight upstairs because I couldn‚Äôt find any anywhere else. What are the other spawns besides the bunk beds?
---
It‚Äôs in the Red Rocket bundle
---
sleep and cranberry RELISH and bobblehead
---
&gt;I have this gut feeling like private servers are literally just going to be regular servers, but locked to friends-only.
---
I'm relatively confident you're right, especially because the screen shows the option of Adventure, Private, and Nuclear Winter. If characters were locked to one mode or the other there would be no reason to show all 3 options.
---
No they shouldn't. But there should be at least some kind of new content that can be done solo.
---
Yeah, they've been promising exactly that for a few months now. It really shouldn't take this long to change some numbers though.
---
Sugar, frog eggs, whisky, strength buff foods
---
I feel like Bethesda should have ‚ÄúThrowback Thursdays,‚Äù where the bring back things that have ‚Äúvaulted‚Äù for a limited time. I **really** want to get the ‚ÄúWelcome Home‚Äù sigh.
---
Sorry, I‚Äôm on Xbox but thanks for the advice
---
Weapon skins, those are the easiest way to get people to spend, cheap, plentiful weapon skins for every possible weapon.  We're talking like 5-10 skins for each weapon.  Rehash the UI to support it as well with a text based list on the left, and as you scroll down a preview pops up on the right. Use X-C (L1-R1 on controller) to scroll between pages.
---
The Flatwoods Monster needs to spawn near other creatures more often. It can control anything, not just your turrets, but so rarely has a chance to.
---
Agree
---
The screenshot in yesterday's ITV showed a choice between adventure, private world, and nuclear winter. Why would they present all 3 option if characters are going to be locked to either public or private?
---
Was he maybe just trying to shoot at the second wave? If he wasn't trying to kill you he probably just wanted the XP and hit you by mistake.
---
Scrap the item it was on, it'll scrap it out of your inventory.
---
You can keep levellng that character and then start a new one. I have done that 5 times. The most fun I have in the game is when I start a new character and try different builds. I don't use power armor at all anymore not even on nuke zones.
---
It would be nice for them to release server files, but that isn't likely to happen anytime soon. Server hosting will likely be by a third party company like g-portal.
---
Thanks mate
---
All I wanted was a bloodied fixer and a junkies bear arm, luckily I got both, other rolls were crap tho
---
a Lever Action AA25FFR15RLD.... from 2k scrip.... i'm so sad...
---
Disease cure
---
 Storing sucks because then you have to relist everything. Better to have them in an area you can cut off from the public.
---
this is a great idea!
---
personally, i take pictures with my phone and have a folder for quick reference for stuff i haven‚Äôt memorized yet.
---
Got three 3* pipe revolvers, two 3* ultracite laser pistols, and one 3* radium rifle that I won't be able to use on ghouls from the purveyor. I did get a nice 3* furious death tambo from the scorch beast queen yesterday, so that was nice.
---
They said it would be cosmetic only and it was at launch. Whatever cam after was just adapting. Also, the purpose of a game like 76 IS to be the touch base or whatever. It's a multiplayer service thing. This the microtransactions. A single player game likely wouldn't be the same. And either way, a good game is a good game
---
I imagine it will release with wastelanders
---
Thats what I just said, it isn't going to happen because they wanna bank on server and mod money.
---
Your gp can't have faster fire rate and DMG while aiming but it should be marginally better than resolute veteran.
---
Blaim weapon balance not the Sheepsquatch :/
---
Yeah I always buy disease cures as well as psychobuff/tats
---
I just got an FE Minigun and I'm still disappointed in Miniguns compared to 50 Cals and Gatling Guns. They consume too much ammo.
---
AA is a +28.9% damage boost and F goes up to +45% after 9 hits, thus the latter is better for high health enemies. However, as far as I know, Furious also boosts the explosive effect while AA does not affect explosive resistance. This means at max hits FE has 22.4% more damage. [Calculator](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html).
---
Because armor is cheaper to get
---
Outer Worlds comes out next Friday. From Obsidian, the makers of Fallout NV.
---
Generally, you'll want to take Incisor (for armor penetration) and Martial Artist (for swing speed and general weight reduction).  For Slugger, take one rank of each (Slugger, Expert Slugger, Master Slugger).  If you feel you need more, then you can take more down the road, but you're essentially getting +30% damage for 3 points instead of +60% for 9.
---
I buy certain things but never bought eather of thoes as 1 i pickup and bulk and sell enough junk and balistic fiber as is. And as for the frige good with salt allows it to stay good longer on you.
---
Hi in web development, I'm dad
---
Yeah great for you, but there is a problem, the game right now still is on a bad state and BGS needs to know that. Post like this only make BGS more mediocre and that's why I'm happy your post died on new. They should get backlash so they fix the game, not praise for the vast minority who actually thinks it's okay. Sorry, like I got absolutley no problem with you enjoying the game, you sharing this is actually kind of wholesome, but my problem is with a post like this that make it seem as if the game wasn't absolute trash still a year after release, which is also what the vast majority believes.
---
Read the responses to the other people that ask this question every damned day 
---
And make up your own mind
---
Common, uncommon and rare weapons skins that can be earned and found by playing are something I've wanted in 76 for a while now as well.
---
They don't have to be special like the Atom-Shop skins either, but simple things like different colors of finish, different levels of wear or rust, different colored wood or even a raider-style splash of colored paint.
---
There are so many different weapons skins that could be done and it's a shame that we can't find or unlock even basic skins for that splash of customization or uniqueness with our arsenal.
---
Yes.
---
&gt; Player counts are already low, and this game is legitimately not fun without people.
---
How do you know that? AFAIK, they've never released player numbers, and since the game isn't on steam or anything we have absolutely no metrics to show whether the player base is growing or shrinking.
---
Would had taken yes or no as an answer
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
two weeklong holiday events (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
No mods
---
Even if there is no setting, enabling PvP like in survival mode would not be an issue for solo players or friends playing in a group. And if "guest" players invited to the server are griefing anyone, they can be banned from joining in the future by blocking them.
---
Oh man!!! That‚Äôs going to be tough. I‚Äôm in a similar boat with the melees, I‚Äôm going for a bloodied swing speed bear arm! Obviously that‚Äôs like a 1 in a billion chance!
---
If i let YOU go first, then I would be forced to go second, and that is unacceptable
---
it‚Äôs just an ugly polygon that is triangular and looks like graphics from like Doom or Quake. hella annoying
---
* Batteries included for ammo weight.
---
* Power user for fusion core charges on gatling lasers
---
* One gun army for stagger and cripple
---
* Stabilized for energy resistance penetration and tighter spread in power armor
---
* Heavy gunner perks for damage
---
* Bear arms for weight
---
* Lock and load for reload
---
* Bullet shield for damage resistance
---
* Bloody mess for damage
---
* Gunsmith for condition wear from shooting
---
* Demolition expert if you have a legacy explosive (for damage)
---
Dude it looks awesome !
---
Damn I was going to ask if anyone has gotten a legendary bear arm! I‚Äôm trying to get a bloodied swing speed one!
---
Any spot with 2 resources so you can pull as much as possible
---
These weapons excel only when applying an effect.  
---
Vampiric, Vault 94 thorn armor bleed, Vault 94 strangler heart acid.  
---
So rather than just giving them more damage, imo give them a wider range of effects to potentially apply.  
---
Buzzblade is a good example in that it has the electric damage mod, which boosts it's dps a ton thanks to the crazy high attack rate in continuous fire mode.  
---
Not everything needs to come down to raw damage.  
---
That said:  
---
Another way to make these weapons better would be to change they way the legendary effect "40% faster swing speed" works.    
---
Currently that effect is wasted on these weapons because they are not effective while swinging but rather best when using the continuous attack mode.    
---
So just make the faster swing speed legendary modifier increase the rate damage procs in continuous attack mode - that would be a 40% increase in DPS and instantly make some of these weapons amazingly good.  
---
All imho. Good topic of discussion so take an updoot. :)
---
Yes, definitely.
---
There has never been a single successful request post for any of those things. Especially not as store items.
---
"There have been many requests!"
---
"From who"
---
"From us for more money!"
---
Many, including myself, have likened Fallout 76 to a post-apocalyptic shooter version of the Sims.  You set your own goals, complete them on your own schedule, tend to your house, and basically have fun "existing" in a fictional world.  Except here, the other characters are actual people instead of NPCs.
---
I do love a death tambo
---
I'd buy it, if it also translated other miners speech :)
---
Broke AF lol
---
Hey hey, it will all be fine. They will definitely delay it till summer.
---
Same reason that when you buy legendary armor, it costs less than weapons.
---
Maybe you could get a set amount each day you long in, and that amount rolls over up to a max amount. That way it doesn't accumulate when you don't play but you can build up a reserve for sales like there is now.
---
That‚Äôs a good one. A lot of people like the power attack over swing speed
---
Judging by the number of people who post this question daily, I'm going to say it absolutely is.
---
Are you crazy to sell 1 stars? No. 
---
1 star items serve two types of buyers: 
---
1. Some players will buy any legendary in order to scrip it. For 1 star items, you're looking at about 60 caps for an armor or 100 for a weapon.  
---
2. Some players don't yet have anything better. Going from a non-legendary handmade to an anti-armor handmade is a big jump. These players will pay a bit (say 180 to 1,800 caps), but the higher your price, the more likely it is to sit in your inventory. I'd only do this for high-demand base-types (e.g. handmades) or high demand affixes (e.g. bloodied or instigating).
---
Heh, glad I'm not the only one that has been confused by that
---
I have the problem! It's most obvious in NW. I have a powerful PC with a bigger processor, more ram and better video card of a friend and when we play NW together, he's loaded in a looting chests 5-10 seconds before I'm loaded in. He has less than 30 on his list, I have over 400. I haven't culled my list yet.. waiting on Private Server info first. But the instant PS's are a bust, my list will drop to 10 (ish).
---
It's probably the reason why Unarmed beats all other melee options dmg wise, if it didn't had this ''disadvantage'' there would be no reason to use any of the other melee alternatives ever. Keeping it restricted to normal armor atleast gives 2H weapons a purpose.
---
Oh interesting. I just posted my own complaint about them not spawning. I thought it was because other players were getting them, but maybe not.
---
I've got 3 alts, highest level is like 15. I just prefer playing on my main.
---
I think the messenger needs to go.
---
thanks ill have to check it out after work!
---
thanks for this insight, sounds about what im doing :)
---
Yes, that is why you are being downvoted. Because people agree with you...
---
Damn you got the bloodied fixer!? What were the other rolls on it!? I‚Äôve got an instigating ffr I‚Äôm trying to trade off for a bloodied version!
---
Got nothing on two characters. Got an insane amount of berserkers stuff
---
A one star bloodied handmade can be sold on the marketplace for up to 5k
---
Shut up and give Bethesda your money, Whale#41245
---
I would trade more if people weren't asking for 60k for shit.
---
I totally understand this idea but PA without power fisting is just wrong
---
The 10 to 30 ish grind is the hard part but after its easy.
---
Yea I seem to get berserkers a lot! That‚Äôs such a limited community of people it‚Äôs nearly impossible to sell off anything that‚Äôs not an absolute god roll.
---
Did they say there was no mods for the ps4? I assumed it would have been like fallout 4 where you can download them
---
They aren't going to allow you to play modded private servers and then bring all your ill gotten goods to public and ruin the public servers even more than they already have.  I'm not going to speculate why its shown on the same screen, but I can promise you if they did that it'd be the dumbest thing ever.
---
Only thankful because you know they failed at their task. Had they been competent at any point in dev than this would be considered outrage. Our standards are so low now.
---
I am glad 100% they are taking the time they need to make it right. Im upset at the reasons why its not out on time.
---
It happens without pa also, going all the way back to beta.  Use the backdoor and you shouldn't have issues.
---
That and they're waaaay overpriced.
---
I died alot getting used to the low health haha,
---
&gt;It's all testing the waters. 
---
Re-read that line.
---
If they can get the community on board with that, then they will continue to try new stuff.
---
Hahaha I went back to my saved comments to copy and paste this here!!! Lol
---
Me too dude, me too.
---
&gt;The paragraph also mentioned utility items being shared with other players to use, but another issue with that is its not.
---
I suspect that's a hint at future content like ammo converters or canning stations. You won't necessarily have to buy one yourself because you'll be able to use someone else's crafting station if you stumble across one.
---
It's not an atom shop thing, but this is already how I deal with alcohol. I don't have either of the stations at my camp, and I don't brew much of anything, but any time I find myself with some ant meat I'll go grab the other materials and then find a brewing station somewhere.  I'd probably treat ammo converters or canning stations the same way unless they're both cheap enough that I can grab them with a week's worth of free atoms.
---
For a fee, and ps4 modes can‚Äôt use models and textures not already in the game

Yab‚Äôs Junkie Guide (or how I learned to stop worrying and love Junkie Weapons)
---
#Addictions 
---
Here is a re-verified list of the negatives from all chems addictions:
---
* #Alcohol [-1chr//-1Agi]
---
* #Buffout [-1Str//-1End]
---
* #Calmex [-2Per//-2Agi]
---
* #Daddy-O [-1Per//-1Int]
---
* #Daytripper [-1Chr//-1Luck]
---
* #Fury [-1Str//-1Per]
---
* #Formula-P [-2Chr//-2Luck]
---
* #Med-X [-1Agi//-10DR]
---
* #Mentats [-1Chr]
---
* #Overdrive [-1Str//-1Agi]
---
* #Psycho [-1Str//-10DR]
---
* #X-Cell [-1Str//-1Per//-1End//-1Chr//-1Int//-1Agi//-1Luck]
---
*Edit: Patch 9 when you die you no longer lose your addictions!
---
Although you can be addicted to everything, the damage bonuses stop affecting Junkie Weapons after five addictions.
---
Some Chems have ‚Äúfamilies‚Äù of addiction (Buffout, Psycho, Mentats) so if you get addicted to Buffout you‚Äôll also be addicted to Bufftats‚ÄîPsycho addiction means you‚Äôre also addicted to Psychotats...etc.  The first part of the word in the mixed chem indicates the family Buff, etc.
---
I‚Äôm not sure at what point this change occurred, but Alcohol no longer stacks.  Previously it was possible to have one of each type of alcohol active at the same time (1 spirit, 1 beer, 1 Moonshine, etc).  Teas, on the other hand, will stack so long as their effects aren‚Äôt the same: if you drink a tea that gives +1Chr, then a tea that gives +2Chr the second tea will replace the first.
---
In my test last night I did find that some chems do stack and it was possible for me to have X-Cell, Fury and Overdrive all active at the same time (would like to hear from other players to verify this).
---
The ‚Äúunder the influence‚Äù picture activates on the pip-boy when you drink Sommerset‚Äôs Special Blend Tea.  I went through 12 Special Blends, 3 Sweet Labrador Teas, and 2 Company Teas (all contain alcohol) in a short period of time without getting addicted.  I hesitate to say it‚Äôs not possible but if it is I imagine it would simply activate the addiction to alcohol.
---
An easy and chem conserving way to gain an addiction is to alternate two chems that don‚Äôt stack; (take a dose, exit the pip-boy, go back in, take a dose of the other chem, exit pip-boy...and so on) in my experience it takes around five of one specific chem to gain an addiction...Med-X seems to take a bit more, X-Cell takes fewer.
---
For fun I tried to get addicted to addictol, that didn‚Äôt happen.  I also went through eight Skeeto-Spit which didn‚Äôt produce an addiction.  Last but not least, though this should be obvious, NukaDark counts as alcohol and will produce the corresponding addiction.
---
#Junkie Weapons 
---
All the Junkie Weapons I use are also explosive so it took a little effort to gather other weapons to test with, (special thanks to M33how, Sergeant_MQZ, Motosan and UnicornQueen971 for helping me gather Weapons) each weapon was max lvl and modded the same as its counterpart.  During my damage comparisons I removed all my perk cards and took Rad-X to suppress all my mutations, and to make sure the melee damage was cleanly affected none of the five addictions I used had a negative Strength modifier.  My stats are 9Str, 14Per, 1End, 4Chr, 5Int, 9Agi, 14Luck....
---

#Editorial (Tips, Perks...and following the Junkie Path)
---
*‚ÄùJunkie isn‚Äôt a build, it‚Äôs a state of mind, man....‚Äù* ‚Äîanonymous 
---
So it‚Äôs obvious that Junkie doesn‚Äôt provide as much damage as Bloodied, however (and since I don‚Äôt run Bloodied) I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs common for most Bloodied enthusiasts to run around with only 2 health so without any perks (and good lord but there are a ton of perks to help the Bloodied build) I imagine the discrepancy between Junkie and Bloodied wouldn‚Äôt be as big depending on how low a Bloodied player usually sets their health.
---
Junkie has an advantage over Bloodied in that I run around with a full health bar; an advantage over Berzerker because I get to run around with all the armor I want and yet still have equivalent damage; and I submit that Junkie Explosive is far superior to Two-Shot Explosive both because it has better damage but also has far better accuracy (especially hip-shot accuracy).
---
There are a few perks to aid the Junkie build but most only affect chem/alcohol duration or the negative food/drink modifiers from imbibing.  Chem fiend would be useful if you wanted to run with the addictions of Fury, Overdrive, Alcohol and X-Cell because (if you had an obscene amount of each chem) you could be constantly popping them at double duration which would, while active, negate the negative effects from being addicted to each.
---
I would like to see a few Junkie centric perks added when it comes time to become a Legendary Player.  Serendipity, Nerd Rage, etc, seem custom designed for the Bloodied build, but most other damage types don‚Äôt have that advantage (For the record I‚Äôd like to see a new armor Legendary type that allows Berzerker builds to wear armor and increase their DRes without negatively impacting their Dmg much the same way Weightless allows the chameleon mutation to stay active).
---
Perks that allow all chems to stack, or one that puts an expiration on addictions (say 12-hours) and requires you to re-up on your chem use (you know...like a junkie!?) to regularly to reset the timer with the benefit of losing your withdrawal negatives for say thirty to sixty minutes, would be a good place to start...I‚Äôm looking at you Beth.
---
If you don‚Äôt run X-Cell, Fury, Overdrive and Alcohol (and I don‚Äôt) you do still have the option to negate one of your chems at a time...I go through a lot of Med-X for this reason.
---
#Bonus Round (A Few Fun Suggestions)
---
I would like to see recipes added for: Buffout, Calmex, Daddy-O, Daytripper, Psychotats, X-Cell and Med-X 
---
And Since the Biv quests and corresponding beverages were a lot of fun for me, here are a few fantasy cocktails I dreamed up:
---

---
+100 rads, and (less than) 1 rads per second for 1 hour
---

---
Cheers

~Yab~

I have a bloody limb damage combat rifle I don't use. Bring me 1000 40mm grenades and it is yours. I want to have fun with my two shot grenade launcher.
---
I‚Äôm going to be naked except a goofy mask or hat mask combo! Hopefully someone will see me and think WTF!?!?
---
I musta glitches out in my the second time around.  Found the key cards a third time and it all went smoothly. Finally have TNT7 key.
---
I was watching youtube, but I went down and read it and is it possible to get drunk in this game
---
Right - we can debate the model but objectively you also want something a bit more deterministic and a bit less slot machine.
---
My biggest gripe is the fact that every new customization they add is in ten atomic shop, no new customization without paying really sucks, I feel jipped, and I know it‚Äôs only going to get worse
---
I think OP is confusing the opinions of the vocal minority in this subreddit with the feelings of the player base as a whole. Despite having 200k+ subscribers, I see the same couple hundred names in every discussion. We are not the minority. In fact, I'd wager that the people browsing this sub make up less than 10% of the base, because like you I see scrap bots at every motherfucking camp, despite everyone here whining about how it was pay to win and a complete rip off.
---
Thanks for the info and this extensive list!
---
I dont really care how long it takes as long as i get it. I have so many games to play in the meantime. My standards arent low there just isnt shit i can do about it
---
In my case they would keep me longer if i wouldnt need to lvl my other chars to lvl 50 to have a different build and play style
---
Doesn‚Äôt that just leave you with a less populated version of Fallout 4?
---
Probably. But with friends.
---
And less stuff to do.
---
for the same reason body armor costs 500 bucks a set, but a fully auto FNFAL will cost you aboot 20k
---
Or the Mothman Statue
---
Probably. But with friends. I do wonder why they didn‚Äôt make it as dense as 4. Also I swear the map is much smaller.
---
Upvoted for the edit. 
---
It's ok, Beth, you already do temp promo, please at least leave the items in for a few more weeks. 
---
And also plz lower prices. I don't buy half your shit because it's way too expensive, and I don't buy the other half because it's fucking out of place. 
---
How bout instead of 1% gamers with money buying 10% of your shop you had 10% of gamers buying 15% of your shop?
---
Like I said, its just dull leveling with a story without choice and consequences. You will also have the survival experience after lvl 50 and you also kinda lose the feeling of survival since you can mule low lvl stuff to your new char. In that case you already start with good stuff instead of finding it. Its about the build you can fully use after you reached lvl 50 to set all of your perk cards for the specific build
---
Insect repellent
---
My entire property is mosaic tiles. That‚Äôs my only flex.
---
Looks like the Fallout 4 neverending perk made its way in on accident.
---
Could this be foreshadowing?
---
Amen brother.  I hear that.
---
Any non legendary is scrap. Any shit legendary is scrip. Any legendary good for your build you keep. Any good legendary not good for your build you sell. Simple stuff.
---
Sometimes I do both, kill you then drop you like 15 superstims lol
---
Do you just have one character or something?
---
Knowing Bethesda, simplifications like having no switch on most things and let you build a separate switch is better than the other way so there wouldn't be more bugs.
---
I'm st work right now, but as soon as I get home I'll check my vendor to see how many I have. I always put my 40mm ammo straight in there. I'll be home in about 6 hours.
---
Agreed. It bothers me how few quests and stuff there are.
---
No luck
---
I dunno why people don't like the raids. The only bad one was the second for being a little too confusing at the part where you have to take samples. I think my run bugged with that one though
---
Did you use up all your insect repellent?  Of course you did, filthy tadpole!
---
good point
---
I was looking foward to playing more 76 but knowing all the features im excited about are in the beginning of 2020 I don't see myself playing this for anything other than season events
---
It won't. This sub has some massive fan boys that won't complain. Also I am 95% sure Bethesda has a pr team in this sub that specifically makes the this game is great post and downvotes any basic opinions.
---
My personal best case scenario is a persistant server where the owner can give permission to X friends (x being a sliding scale of cost) where we can play together, keep our camps up perpetually and even "rebuild" appalachia.
---
and yes either new characters or one time transfers.
---
Sorry... misplaced my response above. I'll send you a message as soon as I get home from work and can play. It should be about 6 hours from now if our internet isn't still out. It's been out for 5 hours now. Only cel works
---
I tried looking around for it but can't find it. But I do see others mentioning or suggesting the idea.
---
 Go to Slocum Joe's. Gather all the Firecap mushrooms across the river, the one in the yard and the ones up behind it. Go down to the river and make your way to Flatwoods gathering Snaptails and Bloodleaf. Then go in the basement of the Vault-Tec Agricultural Research Centre and  grab the Firecaps there by the Chem Bench.
---
 Make some Disease Cure. Its the best way I have found. ;)
---
Once you finish all the quests in FO4 then the game has more stuff to do
---
I have the shag carpet and it just looks so hideous IMO
---
Of course they won't let you play on modded servers and carry ill-gotten goods back to the base game, but we're still a ways away from that. From what I can tell at this point, private worlds will basically just be normal adventure servers with a white list so you can control who joins. If that's the case, there's no reason not to allow people to jump back and forth between modes.
---
Taking a workshop is not griefing.
---
It's quickly becoming the standard in games that have mtx stores. Quite frustrating.
---
Could you add "Allow partial Scrip sales"  What I mean is if I want to sell a weapon worth 40 scrip when 11 scrip away from the limit and only get 11 scrip I should be able to...
---
I know players don't want to hear this, but the biggest weakness with cosmetics is that they aren't very popular and not many people will spend really money on them. I've seen it time and time again with MMOs that switch to a F2P model. The players insist that a game can be supported with just cosmetic items because some edge case game does, the game tries to just sell cosmetic items, it doesn't really generate much revenue, they add a utility item and then suddenly the wallets spring open like it's Black Friday.
---
Of course in each case the players insist that they would have paid for cosmetics, just not the ones offered and that the prices were unreasonably high. It's almost like any skin is going to appeal to a narrow band of people and the price reflects that the dev costs are being split between them.
---
The anti-hero we deserve üëèüèº
---
I'm looking to resell, so my needs might be different from other people's.  Things really have to come together for me to buy a 1\*
---
1. Good Item - ex. Handmade
---
2. Good Prefix - ex. Bloodied
---
3. Good Price - only a few hundred caps, at most
---
If all three things aren't there, I'm not buying. They'll just take up space in my vendor.
---
No. There is a submission process, which is listed on the page.
---
We recently received a valid submission from a user for this topic and, since it was recently posted about, wanted to notify folks on the addition.
---
You cant possibly keep this up till quitting time. oh yeah your 4th cuz mom
---
Got an aaffr 50cal MG and a JDWA handmade, as well as a JE handmade.
---
I really hope that the promised challenges overhaul works out... and increases the amount of Atoms we can earn by gameplay. If we can earn tons of Atom ingame then  it isn't that important what is in the shop. Im not denying the need for quality of Atom shop items, but the source of spendable Atoms needs to be considered too, when talking about success of the Atom shop...
---
Except the fact that you could exploit a private server to control all the workshops on the map with zero fear of having to defend them from players or players taking resources from them.
---
There are a lot of ways to abuse private servers.
---
For a lvl 200+, here is how we look at sub 100s.
---
For the most part we will leave you alone if you are sub lvl 70.
---
After lvl 70 you can have a build that will decimate most players.
---
Post lvl 70, you are just as much of a threat as a lvl 500+ player.  You have the ability to make an endgame build, and with player vendors, have access to all the best gear.
---
So a lvl 80 is a fair fight for a lvl 200.   You took a workshop so that tells us you are ready to PVP, So be ready for the bloodied sneak sniper to take your shit.
---
I'm a possum scout! This weeks raid is tough without it
---
Gotcha,  that's what I get for not reading the other thread.
---
Overdrive, psychotats.
---
I also buy all stealthboys I see just so nobody else gets them lol.
---
Having a max on caps is just dumb. There‚Äôs no cap on the amount of money a person can have in real life. Just ask Jeff Bezos
---
I know just how you feel. Hell, if canning does become a thing I'll turn my CAMP into a full-blown general store.
---
Nah, there's no blurry screen effect. You can take Nukashine and it will turn your screen blue and then randomly teleport you somewhere on the map but other than that no altered screen effects
---
I use neither bird bones or pa so acrobats is a great legendary for me
---
Did they remove the pictures that show that when you buy it or?
---
I'm tired of assassin weapons of all types and blooded. I have gotten a few good weapons but so far I have been dreading getting my next batch of weapons from her.
---
Sorry; the griefing comes after when they keep killing me.
---
Haha that's cool, man. Glad my copy paste is catching on. Appreciate that
---
Have my upvote too.  Came into this thread ready to type this, and glad to see someone beat me to it.
---
yes, but only on the frame
---
I believe its your level plus how much shit you have built.
---
I am not 100% on this though, since I havent moved my camp since January
---
OH YEAH RUSSIAN ROULETTE STYLE FAST TRAVEL
---
I guess I just don‚Äôt know how to make a proper build, because I can‚Äôt do jack squat to them in damage.
---
eastern
---
eh maybe, but for example the things that remove rads have a lever to activate on them..
---
Good stuff for sure. Was rocking a junkies plasma rifle for... 40 lvls before i found one with more stars. It was bought from a vendor.
---
I dont kile them because they are tedious at times. Like who wants to run around fixing pipes while also collecting mainframe cores and getting continuous rads and trying to do it all under a time limit.
---
Mine's been junk. Multiple characters maxed and barely anything worth vending, never mind keeping.
---
Thank you for the tip
---
It increases slowly each time you move with a max of 40 caps per move.
---
Still not griefing, you sign up for PVP when you claim a workshop.
---
There actually is a Russian Roulette style mechanic. They gave us punchbowls to fill with whatever we wanted. You can have any combination of 10 alcohols, or just fill it all with Nukashine. Nothing like lowbies visiting your camp and showing them a little light-hearted griefing
---
Rdr2 great game sadly i played it out and until a new mp content drop theres nothing left for me to do in it lol
---
What really gets me is Bethesda saying the collectron bot and fridge were some of the best selling items.....This probably isn't a lie, but how many would they have sold if there was a version you could earn or find built into the game?  Likely very, very few.   The spin doctoring is what really bugs me.
---
People asked for simple weapon skins and camp cosmetic items forever and they finally came through with handmade skins.  I bet they sold a ton of those.  I really can't understand why so many of the simple things people want have never made it to the shop.  They could have easily released a bunch of the new cosmetic raider and free state stuff in game and had some of the better premium stuff be atom shop exclusive.  Bethesda is totally tone deaf
---
there is a settlement that is under attack...
---
Oh god no that's not content :(
---
Seems like a good thing to have collected In real life.
---
I've had that happen a few times and got a dragon with 35 shots once. I think it has something to do with switching weapons after joining a world and things are still loading in, where the weapon that you switch to gets the magazine of the last thing you had equipped. Haven't been able to replicate it intentionally though.
---
i just tried and it works perfectly!
---
How do junkie builds function?  are you forced to continually take the drugs (thus having to annoyingly farm them), or once addicted are you good to go and you never have to use them again?
---
yeah, just tried and it works! thanks a lot!
---
I managed to get the formal wear challenge done.  I wore my Enclave uniform and hat.
---
Aw sorry dude. Juicehead showed some clips and talked about it in a video a while back. 
---
Can‚Äôt link it rn but it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúFallout 76 News - Hacking Problem and Bans, New Leak Concerns, The Mysterious Cooking Hat‚Äù. Around the 6:38 mark.
---
The original video must have been taken down
---
Calmex.
---
Stealthboys
---
There is a workshop to defend :)
---
Clearly you haven‚Äôt played against the type of people who just want to cap farm lower levels at workshops and will do any means necessary to ‚Äúforce‚Äù PvP outside of that too...
---
fight back u big baby
---
Same here! And you don't get the power armor super hero landing in it. I have full fall damage reduction and it's super fun.
---
Oh me, too. Too long. Not good enough loot. Boo.
---
How many is max?
---
Why the fuck is there a limit on caps in the first place?
---
Would ya look at that? Time for Tea!
---
Bc a really good weapon can become not only your biggest damage multiplier but also your biggest damage mitigator.
---
So per piece it makes sense.
---
I can keep it up all day. My cubicle is well hidden and the smell drives most people away. I'm going to clothesline you in game btw. I'm going to wait outside your camp by the bushes until you come outside. I'll take all your bulk cloth!
---
In video games, it's more important to kill than not die. In video games. Not real life
---
Yeah - not stupid shit like that. Gotta be more interesting. Just not restricted to PVP or something.
---
The worst is the voting one, love breaking pipes compared to hunting those little key cards and "voting".
---
PVPers build specifically to kill other players. 
---
They generally pass on anythign QoL related and go for raw damage and penetration, and some defensive stuff.
---
They also gear for this too.
---
Where a pacificst player probably has a few QoL perks slotted instead of damage or defensive stuff, 
---
all of a PVPers gear is going to be set up to take as little damage as possible and/or deal as much as possible with stuff like Sentinel or Cavalier effects, Unyeilding or Bolstering, Vanguards for full health Junkies.   Where a casual pacificst will have weight reduction, fall damage, lifesaving ect stuff equipped.   A pacifist player will not be geared or perked to handle a full blown PVP build.
---
Your name is unacceptable (lemongrab voice)! I only like clear concise names!
---
Found it in the description. Thanks alot.
---
https://youtu.be/Fvyu1VYzCK8
---
Crit refill 15 and limb damage, I wouldn't trade tho cuz I run a bloodied sneak build.
---
You have to min/max your build which for most people is not much fun.
---
It's griefing when they come in for PvP just for the kill and don't actually take the workshop, so they can come back and kill the owner again and again.  
---
The PvP at a workshop should (in a perfect world) transfer ownership when you kill the current owner, but it doesn't, so assholes abuse it.
---
I'm just telling you how the game works.
---
Man, I keep forgetting I have this game installed. Reddit keeps reminding me.
---
Hey dad im short on rent
---
Had everything possible apart feom a 3x sniper or shotgun. Who wants a bloody cryolator??
---
I'd like to chime in that i would love to see some variation of the very fast weapon type in nuclear winter.  Put the chainsaw, ripper, or the buzzblade in the large crate seeing as the large crate currently has no fucking chance for a melee weapon at all, and no tier of melee weapon higher than medium chest at all in the entirety of nuclear winter. 
---
A fact i still think is arbitrary bs.
---
Spot on ^
---
No problem!
---
I sold a 1\* quad handmade for 500 last weekend. Went within an hour of putting it in my vendor. Not a lot of caps but it made someone happy to own it, or they resold it at a higher price. Either way, we both got something out of the trade.
---
This.
---
It does work, I own multiples of them all and you can farm on other characters you have as well.
---
I‚Äôm just telling you not everything in life is black and white.
---
a peaceful spot with a panoramic view of Appalachia - a quiet camp without doors, walls, or defenses where nothing ever threatens
---
I play like you do. And I love it.
---
Hey, check your calendar, it's Grafton Day! *AGAAAAAAIN!*
---
That's true, but I'm not really seeing a problem with it. At most, it'll just drive the price of junk, cores, and ammo down, which would be a win for people who just play adventure mode.
---
If someone wants to spend their time harvesting acid or holding the munitions factory in a private server &amp; then come to adventure and sell that stuff to me for pennies on the dollar I'm not going to complain.
---
Not my most precious resource! Curses, Foiled again
---
yeah I know, was more interested in which character has the spawn on cooldown afterwards
---
Showers bench and bunk beds.
---
15
---
They seem low. Nobody should think this is good. Its not. Its an unfortunate opportunity for development and improvement. As a metaphor its like losing your home to a flood but the insurance lets you buy a better house in a few months and all your favorite stuff survived the flood.
---
In the end you are better off but it still is a bad thing.
---
Extreme example i know, but pretty spot on.
---
cool
---
Wait is that mask valuable or something?
---
Whichever picks them up.
---
I would get the level 46 to 50 for buying from the purveyor even if starting a new character.
---
Until bethesda changes it it's a silly thing to complain about..... workshops = PVP
---
2 berserker fatmen and a flamer. A berserker rolling pin and a beserker pipe. 
---
No matter the stats and other specs they were still trash
---
30k
---
No, you don't have to continually use them. Once you're addicted, it's always there.
---
The only reason to take them again is to take off the addiction debuff for that specific chem, but once the chem effects are over, you're back to being addicted.
---
So the more I run around, the more it increases? Has nothing to do with how far I am from my camp?
---
Killing people who are half your level is griefing.  Always has been and always will be.
---
I‚Äôm not so sure you‚Äôd be very amused being cap farmed and trolled by ‚ÄúTSE Chad‚Äù over and over and him along with his buddies and then not actually taking the workshop they killed you for...
---
Disease cures
---
No. Its based on the amount of times you move your camp.
---
I got that one‚Ä¶ almost didn‚Äôt, but decided to at the last minute.
---
It has a  0.01% chance of dropping as a reward.
---
4 fixers so far, bloodied, furiuos, medic, 2shot. Tse hunting rifle, tse pump shotgun, 2 Vampire mini guns, Vampire ultracite Gatling. Had all 5 toons at 1k scrip. 4k to 3* ranged, 1k to 3* armor. I am forking loving this sale.
---
I think I'll do this weekly. An argument post. We all need it lol.
---
Oh I‚Äôve had one forever, I had no idea it was rare.
---
And (almost?) no lag! That'd be epic.
---
It wont happen to me. I don't take workshops because I'm not interested in PVP
---
It didn't used to have that low of a percentage, but a few patches ago it happened.
---
Just give up dude. You're in the middle of a flat earther convention. Facts don't matter when personal opinions are at stake.
---
BE, AA, and troubleshooters  harpoon guns. Over 4k scrip in 3*ranged weapons and 0 crossbows. ( Praises be unto thee RNGebus,  I will try to be worthy of your continued blessings)
---
I have infinite loading without power armor only at the back door. üòÇ
---
I still use it tho üòë
---
Nobody asked for it directly. Their looking at the sales numbers.
---
Haha, very true.
---
YEAH!
---
Sadly they are in the DLC. üòî
---
Oh okay
---
If TSE Plasma Chad is greifing you, go to another server.
---
We are the reason they closed Survival.   Expect backlash from the PVPers until they get their mode back.
---
I have weird things like this happen with my hunting/sniper rifle. I'll load in and have 25 shots loaded. Once I finally reload, it acts normal the rest of the session.
---
You want stuff to cost 10 character of max caps??? Because that's what people would charge.
---
Well if you ever wanna sell it share some of those weapons, you know where to go. Enjoy the variety this game has to offer with the many weapons!!
---
The mods don't like each other
---
Cheap bullets, people who sell 1 cap ammo are Champs.
---
Yes there is. Why would you want stuff to cost 100k+ caps..
---
Levels 211, 139, 116, 111, 61 here.
---
I'll take your workshop, leave your junk, buy stuff from your shop, mod your weapons, revive you if you are down, and take your workshop again.
---
thank you!  I guess the balance is finding if the few hundred caps for a 1 star are worth more than simply scripping it myself
---
What are the other effects on that .50 cal? If one is 90% reduced weight, I‚Äôll buy/trade for it if you‚Äôre on pc.
---
I've been doing this with my current character, who I've restricted to the ash heap. He tries to pacify all mole miners he comes across, only uses shotguns, mole miner gauntlets, and pickaxes, and collects all ore he comes across.
---
I can hold my own thanks. Was referencing the above example for the OP being a lower level and possibly newer to the game...
---
Yeah it says "Launch your very own rocket!" but doesn't mention anywhere \*Must be from damage to rocket, cannot launch otherwise\*
---
Real life too.  You can get a set of AR500 for 500 bucks, a full auto FNFAL is 20k
---
not sure, i didnt even know it was still available in the atom store?
---
... so easily forgotten.
---
It would be cool to have a slotted case like an old 8track case to put on the bed or desk or something. Would be nice to have a Holotape stereo that actually played holotapes too.
---
I thought I wasted my free atoms when I first bought it instead of buying any of the nice wood floors. But I don't see anyone's camp's with this flooring XD.
---
That's due to material cost and production too though, but I feel you
---
Fuck that gimme the white springs carpet thats the only one ive ever wanted and ive missed it twice now, filling the hole with.... ASTROTURF
---
So it‚Äôs only your personal opinions that have credibility as being facts?
---
I didn't have enough Atoms at the time
---
Dont forget weapons have moving parts, armor does not.
---
Machining costs money.
---
Hardening costs money.
---
Engineering costs money (doesnt take much to engineer a flat peice of metal)
---
If pipe pistols were fixers and bash damage was explosive I'd have cleeeeeaned up on this sale
---
My understanding is that when the Purveyor was designed, the world drop chance for [Armor was by itself 53%](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c5pfrf/loot_drop_chances_roundup_june_26/). You had twice the chance to get armor than a melee weapon. Therefore, the larger volume of Armors would have to be offset by smaller Scrip value: 2.5 scrip rounded up to 3 (about 86% of the drops was 1\* at that time). Thus the expected Scrip return for a legendary encounter is:
---
`0.86*(3*0.53 + 5*0.24 + 5*0.23) + 0.095*(9*0.53 + 15*0.24 + 15*0.23) + 0.045*(24*0.53 + 40*0.24 + 40*0.23) =`
---
`0.86*3.94 + 0.095*11.82 + 0.045*31.52` = **5.93**
---
After Patch 11, the [Armor drop chance has been balanced](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cnn07a/loot_drop_chances_roundup_august_8/) to be around 33.3%. In addition, 1\* drop chance is slightly above 54% only. Thus, the expected Scrip return now is:
---
`0.54*(3 + 5 + 5)/3 + 0.285*(9 + 15 + 15)/3 + 0.205*(24 + 40 + 40)` =
---
`0.54*4.33 + 0.285*13 + 0.205*34.66` = **13.15**
---
If they leveling the Armor scrip cost, that would give `0.54*5 + 0.285*15 + 0.205*40` = **15.18** if scaled up or `0.54*3 + 0.285*9 + 0.205*24` = **9.1**.
---
Therefore, overall you get twice as many scrip per encounter than before and leveling the numbers would either somewhat improve or considerably reduce it, which is risky at this time for the game.
---
I would argue that the overall legendary spawn chance halved to 2.5% (as experienced in game, despite datamining indicating 5%) is the reason the scrip income hasn't drastically improved after all.
---
This is the correct answer. The game keeps track of 2 loot lists: looted containers and looted placed items. Once a looted item rolls of the list, only then will it respawn or refill. The looted items is either 160 or 180 and the containers is like 40 or 60. I'm not sure where the info is stored in the ESM so if anyone knows the numbers definitively, feel free to correct me.
---
To learn the legendary "mods".
---
Strangely every time that can of worms get opened up here, the posts disappear.
---
That would void the purpose of having a cap cap.
---
3 months? I think theres just the addition of Nuclear Winter (Battle Royale) and they took away Survival mode. Nothing else comes to mind the last 3 months.
---
Also they removed survival because they tried to balance PvP, made PvP even worse (?) and then removed it to later implement the suggestions in another form of PvP later (probably faction wars)
---
Yeah, I was just thinking. I haven't seen a proper terminal in camp building, only the round whacky one.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that it would make a nice addition, even though I wouldn't see any use for it if you couldn't connect it to a power grid. It would be cool though! Even more so if you could write in it yourself. Idk if that's even possible. I guess it would be annoying on console.
---
I don‚Äôt see how that makes any sense or why it even matters.
---
Mine ranges from pathetic to sad.
---
Then nobody would buy. Value is dictated by the supply of something and the demand for it. In rl and in game.
---
Does anyone know if limited possible as a safeguard for people that may find or currently have an exploit?  Else what do you think the logic behind the limit is?
---
Yea! I recently reinstalled and made a.new char figuring by the time wastelanders rolled out idf be done the main story for the 3rd time. I'm glad they won't release it half finished. But SOME details, screenshots and such would be very welcome.
---
Then I'm confused it's a TSE armor piercing automatic handmade? Where did the AP come from? The receiver? Sorry don't always get the terminology I'm relatively new
---
stealth boys
---
Yeah, should not be possible for any weapon or any build to one shot a legendary.
---
I'll add you later. I'll help you guys out I'm level 198.
---
Yeah not everyone has common sense, or courtesy. What can you do?
---
I try to be good to everyone, unless provoked otherwise. The way I see it is, just because other people are shitty, it doesn't mean I have to be.
---
Two shot is a Prefix, Explosive is a Major, you can have them both at the same time. 
---
But if you only had the option of one or the other, Explosive is better.  TS is dependant on the second shot hitting, which doesnt happen alot of the time.  
---
To break it down.  Explosive is +20% dmg, TS is +25% dmg when the second shot hits.
---
TS also degrades accuracy, so you will miss more.
---
My advice, look for Explosive with a different prefix in front of it for the best option.
---
It would be beautiful, I wish they‚Äôd give it a try.
---
And for those of us who like the threat of PvP but don't like battle royale, we got completely fucked with the removal of survival lmao
---
Seriously what would the show have been without me!?!?  Like, think about it.  Imagine what words you would use to describe that show, and then tell me which one of those words does not also describe me?  I WAS the show!
---
If you want to play, reinstall first.
---
Add Roo1983
---
I havent moved very often but I know it is a lot cheaper on my lower level guys. My higher level (150 and 250\~) characters always costs 40 caps even if I'm just trying to move it a few inches to get the ring just right, 40 CAPS! So possibly based on level and likely not at all based on how far from your last placement lol
---
That might be cool. I wouldn't see a problem with it, I type on a keyboard on my PS4. We can name weapons, so it's posible. If it makes the game laggy then maybe not. I'm not sure how game saves work, but I know the more plans my character knows the longer it takes to craft and cook. Because of the lag.
---
added
---
Seems like you don't understand economics an supply an demand.
---
That was the only way for them to make the first 3 ranks worth 10% each and the last 6 ranks worth 5% each. Otherwise they would have had to make it two perk cards with 3 and 6  levels and that's not much less messy. Making it a flat 10% per rank makes the card overpowered.
---
sounds good!
---
I hope they give us the arcade cabinets from the Creation Club, but as a quest reward.
---
I'd put in one of the towns, possibly one of the less frequented ones like Beckley or Lewisburg, but Morgantown could be a good place for it due to the presence of the UVT campus, a set of arcade cabinets and associate them with a daily quest about playing these games and getting a certain score and based on your rank you get some rewards, and the plan to built the cabinets in your camp. Or better yet, make them keep actual community-wide scores like real life arcade cabinets. That would incentive people to play the Pip-Boy games, which imo are really well made and it's a shame that they are so badly integrated with the overall game. Hell, make some atom challenges associated with them too.
---
Had that happen with other weapons from time to time, a relog will correct it.
---
Why not a normal unferal ghoul like in the other Fallouts.
---
I play like you a lot of the time. I also enjoy just traveling the roads for random encounters, or going on scavenging trips. From what I've seen it seems really rare if not unique for a game like this to be catering to such a variety of playstyles.
---
Set the cabinets up in your camp. Charge one cap a game lol.
---
This is so cute!!!! I love it!  It‚Äôs like watching a kid who just realized his toy wooden boat actually floats in water!  üòò
---
Oh, you're right! I know what I'm doing for the next three levels!
---
Yeah! That would be such a great addition. My camp's theme is a comic book shop, and I think that it would be awesome to have arcade cabinets in it. Even though my camp budget is always full from all my displays.
---
It's spelled "psych."
---
Enlighten me then.
---
That is how a flat earthers thinks, yes. Despite overwhelming evidence, they reject anything you say.
---
That is how many anti-PVP players think. The game warns you every single time you take a workshop. You can be killed at any time within the borders. You consent to it. Other players killing you in a workshop is intended by the developers. If it wasn't, it wouldn't be there. If you keep getting killed, it means you have re-entered the workshop and re-consented to PvP.
---
Try this out if you think I am insane. Go to an arcade. Find an empty fighting game cabinet. Play the computer until someone shows up to fight you. When you lose, go find the owner and tell them to kick out the person because you did not want to fight them. That is insane. The whole point of the cabinets is to fight other people. The whole point of workshops is to fight other people. Fighting the computer/gathering free resources is what you do while you wait for another player.
---
if you are over lvl 70, you are free game.   Read my above statement about the possible builds at that level. 
---
At lvl 70, you are able to have the same effectiveness as a lvl 500.  
---
If you take a workshop you tell the server you are ready for PVP.  
---
If you dont want someone 5xs your level to come kill you, dont take a PVP battleground.
---
I got a quad broadsider and immediately scripped it 
---
I do have a quad Fletchettes harpoon gun though and it‚Äôs rock solid
---
Because the best defense is a good offense
---
The purveyor? Can you elaborate? Thanks!
---
Yeah, I'd rather have a smooth game, but how cool it would be to create a backstory to your camp, for those who actually have lore friendly camps (I mean camps that aren't hanging in the air supported by some stairs).
---
Thank you all, for your suggestions. I think I will end up starting a new character.
---
My very first 3* was an executioners grognak from a super mutant.  I haven't seen anything else that's been anywhere near that spec. 
---
I modified my entire character build around that weapon and mutations.
---
Sign me up
---
Hi short on rent, I'm out of here
---
Literally just had the same thing happen to me but with stable fluxes x7. I was pretty angry about it.
---
Removing over-repair bonus felt bogus but reverting it can't be done for balance purposes.  Can you just imagine the meat hook?
---
That said, a small buff is in order as well as making weapons like the chainsaw scale with some sort of damage perk.  Perhaps this is already planned as a legendary perk but we'll just have to wait 17 months or so to find out.  Idk if you have ever tried out the minigun shredder with basher on, but that's a good example of how careful Bethesda has to be with buffing any vfast weapon.
---
Side note. I like the idea with basher perk, but unless they do it differently than the minigun shredder, all your buzz blades and everything would break right away like the minigun.  Weapon bashes seriously reduce weapon condition, so severely that even though the shredder is my favorite weapon, I only use an anti-armor +40 bash one now, and that's if I have 20 repair kits to spare.  It lasts a lot longer than a normal shredder because it kills them faster and so it doesn't need nearly as many hits, so generally I can do one clear of whitesprings before it needs repair.
---
Not about to break down economics an supply an demand to a random on reddit who keeps downvoting me. Enlighten yourself, it's a valuable thing to learn.
---
Nice. I did the same to an instigating, 40% faster machete. It does about 1800 damage on sneak
---
Oh, yeah but that really kills the whole chase so I can see why they wouldn't want to allow that.
---
99.9999% of camps have a stash box... dump junk items before fast traveling... 3 scorchbeasts taught me my lesson on that!...lol
---
[Beatrix Russell](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Beatrix_Russell) would be awesome!
---
Yes :D Load shedding. Anyway its still doing it. Changed the batteries and as I mentioned if i turn on both controllers it turns both off which is creepy AF
---
How do you get legendary effects on the fixer? I got the plans last Cryptid, but no * effects.
---
10 + 25 - 20
---
I am hoping we can bounce back and forth between completely unmodded private / public servers.  
---
Once mods come into play, characters would make one-way trips.
---
Anti-armor rocks!!
---
Yeah thought so, I just set up a double battery inverter so we'll be good for the loadshedding now lmao. Are you on pc using controller?
---
The best one I got out of about a thousand script was a fffr less vats black powder pistol if that tells ya anything
---
I‚Äôm mediocre, not great but not bad...lol
---
Recycling is always good...lol
---
Just bumping up the spawn a little would help, more chance to show up at events to control large mobs( read about one controlling the SBQ). Also why not have an endgame event something like encrypted, with he flatwoods monster as the finale fight.
---
This is what I have done with every Bethesda game since Oblivion.
---
What stuff are you talking about?
---
100% positive more people have asked for keg plans than private servers...lol
---
I dont think any of this is a good thing. Im just patient
---
get Out Of Here!
---
He went to the store and hasn‚Äôt come back.
---
I usually fast travel to a nearby location and walk to player camps because of this problem. I've wound up in walls too many times.
---
Okay I sent you a friend request. My IGN is Artyom_Chyornyj.
---
People already charge up to 100k for "God roll weapons" and rare outfits. If there was no max caps people would be charging so much more for items that nobody that doesn't play non stop like of these kids would be able to afford. But then again caps are useless in most trades. A lot of people wont even accept them. Trades now are done in 556 ammo or rare items for rare items.
---
Alcohol and Psycho are good so you can negate the addictions with Psychotats/buff and Ballistic Bock, I picked Overdrive too, I think it stacks with other chems for some reason. I believe Fury is like that as well
---
I think its kinda ridiculous that somehow we magically increase damage for no reason. Like small boosts to damage with perks like in the old Fallouts was somewhat more immersive. But this whole oh look a magical boost in damage is freaking ridiculous.
---
It should stay unless he removed it.  I did this for a buddy and also open signs and stuff
---
I'm using a controller on PC. play all my PC games with controller for accessibility reasons. I have a machine upstairs that Doesn't have the issue. And the computer in the lounge has the issue and nothing has fixed it.
---
As a prepress tech. listen to this man. or we take your workshop. forget bleed, you bleed.
---
CMYK. CMon You Knucklehead.
---
Damn, max level spawns all over the map is an option I'd love to have, although as a student I can't quite afford to "purchase" the service, especially if it's a monthly subscription thing.
---
As long as he stores it and doesn‚Äôt scrap it.
---
Yeah. But if he moves then he won't be able to place his camp down using the blueprint, he'll have to place everything by hand. He'll still have the Fusion though
---
I think something like 5-10 dollars a month with the option to at first make small changes, akin to Battlefields private servers and then of course Mods would be ok with me.
---
Do you have two plans, or do you have the plans? If you have two plans, give your buddy a set.
---
It really feels like a slap in the face for Bethesda to tell us that they‚Äôre data shows that they need to sell utility items in the Atom Shop to find things while simultaneously ignoring a full year of community suggestions for cosmetics that people would buy.
---
I would buy some Atoms if they sold some Brotherhood of Steel cosmetics and camp decorations. I know a lot of people would be willing to spend money on Enclave cosmetics or skins for weapons that actually get used. We‚Äôve been telling Bethesda this for the past year, and they still say they have to go back on their original promise of a cosmetic-only store. They‚Äôve tried nothing and still failed. They‚Äôve tried nothing and they‚Äôre all out of ideas.
---
Yeah, they need to really focus on that more. And I'm not trying to push the blame to those who buy atoms, as opposed to those who earn them as well, because it's everyone's fault for even buying these things. And to Bethesda, they are making money. And now Bethesda wants to make it stock holders happy
---
No I randomly found someone selling it a bought it but havent found it again and we have been trying to get one from events but no luck yet
---
There's another body that needs to be buried.
---
Translation:
---
I don't really know, but just trust me becuase I said so.
---
This sounds awefully familiar.... :p
---
Well think to urselves for a moment.if you add mods and more mods that changes how things are done. Eventualy the private server will become unstable.
---
I like the idea of a modus themed vendor,  that'd be pretty cool
---
Brawling does look super badass on leather armor though.
---
(I don't have an answer to your question, sorry.)
---
You need to do the "powering up" at least three times to get the fusion plan .)
---
I think I found them at one of the power plants.
---
Nope
---
You commie... Freebies? Todd doesn't likes you! üòí
---
Lmao, sure bud. Try not being such a tool for once in your life. You're not worth my time and effort to explain the entire break down of economics an supply and demand. Peace out kid..
---
Yea, I kind of figured.  It's a shame, would be a good selling technique to come up with clever names.
---
It's a thing because it keeps the game balanced. Look I know people don't wanna hear it but it's true. Forgetting people with multiple accounts buying and selling things outside of the game for stupid money, the max you can sell something is 30k, because that's the max a person has and that's the max you can have. It keeps items from being stupid priced. 
---
If we have unlimited caps, people can list stuff for stupid money and then those who play the game more than the average person are shut out of the economy. It will literally be the rich and the poor. I have a full time job and other responsibilities. I can't play as much as a high schooler... and especially with Xmas coming up, a high schooler who isn't even at school. 
---
So yeah, a cap limit is good. I will never pay 30k for *anything* in this game. That is ALL MY MONEY. And I will never charge that because I don't have room for 30k in my pocket. 
---
The limit keeps prices fair and if you play as a trader, camp hop, you know what prices are good *because* of the limit, *because* there is a max price.
---
As much as people on this subritted seem.to think we are the voice of the game, there are millions of people who play this game and don't even know this place exists.
---
I bought a junkie faster firerate handmade yesterday. 
---
I love it. It rips. I went stealth bloodied commando for a long time. Got really tired of crouching my way through every encounter.
---
Private severs could be good for pvp if u get people u can do team deathmatchs.
---
grilled radstag, ribeye steak.  yes, im a food build, y do u ask?
---
receivers dont add AP, they add damage, fire rate, or crit damage.
---
AP comes from the magazine.
---
Enclave, BOS, Responder themed items. We‚Äôve just been getting shitty raider items. What about a modus terminal that greets you by name? Similar to codsworth. Also adding items from prefabs. Such as the barrels and crates from the free states trailer. Or maybe choosing a faction for 1400 (only 1 change) and you get themed items, but you get locked off from the other items
---
Does your weapons have Dr while reloading prefix
---
I'll sell them at 3k
---
Ooops my Bad, but still
---
sounds perfect if you wanna add me i‚Äôll join your server my name is AtomicTardis
---
It will be around 730
---
nice, i really like the modus terminal idea!
---
seriously
---
You are correct about junkies being less than half the damage of bloodied, but I don‚Äôt understand why?  I thought the bloodied damage buff maxed at +60% with another 20% from nerdrage.  But i seem to get much more benefit than 80% at 19% health.  (PA, not unyeilding.)
---
What am I missing?  Thanks!
---
Does your Furious have either Explosive or 250DR While loading. 
---
the DR250 effect will break the furious.
---
The explosive splash damage if it hits another creature will reset the stacks, so explosive is bad too (hitting yourself also resets it, so you cant be close and use it)
---
Hermit crab + wrecked vertibird or
---
Hermit crab + HOUSE!!! 5***** legendary hermit crab! The only way to even try and kill it would be to have an ENTIRE server part of the battle!
---
I have them if you don't end up getting them.
---
Spent just short of 400 scrip, got a 3* anti armor 50cal machine gun, a 3* zealots gatling laser, and a 2* anti armor assaultron blade
---
Nope. I‚Äôm well aware of the damage resist +250 while reloading bug. This is not that. I had that on a vampires Gatling laser. It was the saddest thing for me. I loved that gun to death, but the broken damage resist perk made me turn it in for scrip. We are talking about a furious explosive minigun right now. I have encountered this with all furious heavy machine guns and the lmg.
---
Yea I think that‚Äôs how the RNG is tuned. It tends to give me stuff that the particular character does NOT use. My heavy gunner character gets bunch of rifles and pistols, but my rifle character does get heavy weapons, sometimes even usable ones. It might be a way to encourage players to try something new instead of keep using the same stuff over and over.
---
hey if you wanna add me i‚Äôll join your server ! thanks so much
---
As much as I want this, my stash/budget cant handle any more displays counting towards both.
---
I don't like that my wife and I have been unable to complete a raid without one or both of us crashing. We've given up on it for now after four separate tries (two for Meltdown, one for the others). It really sucks that you can't join back in on your team if you crash, 3/4 of our crashes has been just one of us, so the other is abandoned in the vault.
---
Once a patch comes out and addresses the raid crashes, we'll try again.
---
I‚Äôve had it happen with Gatling lasers as well. No explosive to be had there, I could only wish I had a legacy Gatling laser.
---
And no, it doesn‚Äôt have the dr perk. Commented on that elsewhere.
---
ok thanks for the heads up!
---
You eat the plan then murmrgh will be able to give you legendary fixers.
---
KEG PLANS...right-da-phunk-meow!
---
But if you are really paranoid, storing them is currently the only option to absolutely prevent sales.
---
Which is silly and a total beginner's trap - I think most players would assume that a vending machine that has no power is inaccessible, but in Bethesda's infinite wisdom, they thought differently.
---
I added you. I'll log on now. HillbillyDLUX08 is my PSN
---
The protectron might not offer much utility but you go play for a while away from your camp and come back, he's gonna have some junk filled up in there for you.  That's free junk and often it's going to be more of the stuff you had marked for search.  It may not be a huge advantage but it is an advantage.  It's free extra junk you didn't have to search for.

They won‚Äôt. It‚Äôll be radio silence on Wastelanders until a week before it comes out, bugs and all. They‚Äôll give us info on overpriced bundles, though.
---
I have 4000 scrip in reduced weight items in my stash. So, yeah...
---
i keep 2 legs with the 50% fall damage mitigation on me at all times, i pop em on for 100% damage reducation and jump off the top of monorail elevator,...... its a rush!
---
As for private servers being a paid feature, I take no issue with that, assuming they‚Äôre not insanely priced. That‚Äôs a service that carries additional costs for Bethesda. They will have to run more world instances than before, that costs money, so I‚Äôm fine with charging a reasonable fee for the service. I also think most players will be fine with it too, at least depending on what the service looks like. It may also draw new players in who were previously wary of sharing a world with strangers. 
---
The Atomic Shop stuff...well I guess that remains to be seen. If the new things they add are just more novelties like the Collectron, nobody‚Äôs going to care. If it‚Äôs a bunch of consumables that make it so the game is shaking you down for money every time you try to do anything, that‚Äôs gonna kill it.
---
For real, I‚Äôve done everything i can think of. I want dialogue choices, with anyone. Even if it‚Äôs just a random wastelander. I‚Äôve been playing my character since release, and still don‚Äôt know what he is. Is he a smart ass, evil genius, cynic? I want to develop my character! And a new emoticon, or atom store paint just doesn‚Äôt do it.
---
Oh man, I would fucking use PA if they made an Enclave X-01 skin with a voice yelling shit at everyone like Sergeant Dornan muahaha
---
Bloodied combines with Adrenal Reaction, so you're getting the Bloodied buff AND the Adrenal buff.
---
Junkies also stacks with Adrenal, but Adrenal doesn't do much at high health, and if you're running a junkies build the whole point is so you don't have to run with low health, so most of the time Adrenal isn't doing much for you (it's often still worth taking Adrenal so that as you DO lose health you gain damage output; the HP penalty of having Adrenal isn't bad, and is even more minimal with Class Freak)
---
I'm not saying that's 100% what's going on in your case, but it might be.
---
Agreed, also makes sense if scouts for the factions came first to see if it‚Äôs safe before everyone comes
---
Nope, I gave all my furious heavy weapons away. I don‚Äôt have the room to hold onto broken weapons and I‚Äôm not about to create an alt to do it for me. I‚Äôm using TS limb damage now.
---
Thanks, I was never gonna use the emitter. Glad it went to someone who can and will use it.
---
I'm glad this came up, because I have one I've been planning on selling but I wasn't sure what it was worth.
---
It's only Fixer, Bear Arm, Sheepsquatch club/staff and the Shepard's Crook that has this caveat
---
Not when the lower level character explicitly agrees to PVP with any player on the server, which they do every time they take a workshop.
---
Yea there‚Äôs a cap. After nine shots I read someone say just the other day but I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe with the high rate of fire you don‚Äôt even notice the increase. Idk I don‚Äôt use furious but yea that would be ridiculous damage if no cap.

I saw a plan being offered this morning for 20k. I was short 5k, unfortunately. If you went to 20k I'd understand.
---
Got several F25/FE heavies, it most definitely works. FE 50 cal will max the 110 dmg cap in pvp after few hits on non-blodied/junkie build. Must be some glitch on your side.
---
Ok, thanks. Still a shame I havent gotten any after 70+ lvls of having both bps, and 150+ without a dragon
---
Just walk very slowly around mama murmrgh, the problem will go away in a few days.
---
There are 2 META schools right now.  Ranged and melee. 
---
For ranged, its Bloodied Sneak Rifles.
---
For Melee its Bloodied Meat Hook.
---
Nice advertisement!
---
Still better than my nocturnal bashing broadsiders üëå
---
loads matey
---
That's fair but pvping in adventure is 50/50 either they leave after a death or actually fight back
---
Clearly you don't understand that it's a feature of the game, not a bug.  Don't want to announce to the whole server that you are okay with PVP?  Don't claim a workshop.  Period.
---
This gave me a giggle thanks
---
It does
---
What leaked players numbers..? Do you have a link?
---
No, but the fact that you actively consent to PVP with anyone on the server when you take a workshop is.
---
Dude can you read? I‚Äôm not arguing saying don‚Äôt PvP at workshops... I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs grieifing when you‚Äôre playing the game and lower levels get constantly seeked out to be cap farmed and abused (primarily at workshops) unless you‚Äôre one of those people that thinks that‚Äôs ok lol.
---
You have my condolences.
---
I see I missred ur post, there is cap at 9 or 10 bullets
---
Gonna need the specs of your PC and graphics card
---
"over and over"  ... that only happens if you don't switch servers and keep trying to claim shops.  When you claim the shop, you literally tell "TSE Chad" that you consent to PVP against him.  Duh.
---
Does the gun in question also have +250 Damage Resistance While Reloading?
---
Not at all, I was specifically asked what I sell the plans for and giving platform is important because prices vary wildly between then. Also was mention about the scarcity of the plan, as I only have one left and no one I know has any, that too is valuable information. üëçüòÜ
---
Nocturnal Berserker with Meteoric Sword of course. Or it will be. You'll see!
---
&gt; lower level and possibly newer to the game... *and actively consenting to PVP.*
---
Fixed it for you.
---
You specifically mention PvP, what about PvE in your experience. I don‚Äôt see this bug being persistent on my end alone for 4 months.
---
Everyone is either awesome or terrible
---
There fixed the title for ya, had unessary words

Who gives a crap what their goal is with PVP, **you consent to it when you take a workshop.**

I'd keep it for you at 15k mate, but not gonna be letting anymore go for 12 to friends! Gotta get those fat stacks of caps so we can supply the wasteland. A well armed wasteland is a happy wasteland
---
Never understood why you can‚Äôt use the POWER fist in POWER armor
---
üëÖ
---
Going by your logic then... if I‚Äôm at my camp minding my own business and a Griefer comes along and drops a nuke mine, he then forces me into PvP as such. So what‚Äôs your stance on that? ‚ÄúBecause it‚Äôs in the game hur dur‚Äù you just seem like an asshat with no decency to lower levels.
---
Ok I had people saying it didn‚Äôt
---
It does work.  But if there is a group of enemies and the explosive damage hits another one, the game records it as a non consistant hit and resets the stacks. 
---
Its still viable on single targets, but for groups you will have an issue with stacks dropping off.  This is why I dont use my FE mini anymore.
---
Hopefully we get some decent PVP and non-PVP communities set up when the private servers roll out. As it is now most folks seem to want nothing to do with PVP and then call it griefing when someone kills them at a workshop. Anyway, some of us just get crazy when we're drinking, don't take it personally, it's not like they're slashing the tires on your Mazda irl
---
No I just heard people saying it wouldn‚Äôt work together
---
I have been finding a lot of workshop fights with actual PVP builds lately. It has been a nice change of pace. They are much friendlier than the PVErs.
---
It's dumb.  Fallout 4 basically shit all over unarmed and kind of ruined the better aspects of melee as well, but while melee was at least viable, unarmed got the short end of the stick hard.
---
76 really only fixed unarmed being underwhelming as far as damage, but didn't really fix the other underlying problems, like hit detection for melee and unarmed, and it also didn't adjust the potential to use unarmed weapons in power armor yet again because most of this game is pretty much ripping the mechanics straight from Fallout 4.
---
I love Fallout 4, but man, do I really just dislike fundamentally what they did with melee and unarmed in 4/76.
---
Nope it works. My FE Handmade and FE fixer are boss.
---
To my knowledge it does.
---
Which probably includes the bundles
---
Thats a good idea. Recon teams would be a nice touch.
---
No, you paid for the base game, nothing more. Those 60$ were base, and since this was never meant to be singleplayer, it was never part of the base package. And my issue with caps and ammo was, if you dup them in single player then come and spend them in multiplayer. Other games don't host, maintain or regulate the servers, true, but other games have the dup glitch like Ark where you can get much stronger dinosaurs from singleplayer server and then bring them to multiplayer, therefore ruining the server
---
Explosive adds +20%dmg
---
FFR increases fire rate by 25% which = 25% more damage. 
---
Numbers say FFR is better.
---
........kinky?
---
I know there was a few big people who it took awhile to get banned, and then when they were banned they had a new account already with almost the same name. So, I can see that point as well
---
Yeah I have an FE handmade I would rather have FFFR
---
I didn't know, it's been a long time since I needed that plan :)
---
Naw. Takes 5 seconds to make a sign. Takes 20 min to store an then put them up an relist everything.
---
Fair
---
Agreed. F4, I loved collecting all the different outfits and lining them up like a wardrobe display, was a challenge to see how many different outfits I could find. I probably have  15+ already for when this becomes an option. Also, I don't mind the displays themselves counting towards camp budget but the items on display counting towards both stash and build budgets? I guess it has something to do with graphics and server load etc. but c'mon... One or the other, please...
---
&gt;and lower levels get constantly seeked out ***after actively consenting to engage in PVP with anyone on the server.***
---
Fixed it for you.  (Except for "seeked".  I left that alone, but it's not a word. You're thinking "sought".)
---
Got mine at Whitesprings shops from the raider vendor.
---
This is actually confusing for the consumer. They may buy something which then all of a sudden locks out other things they wanted to buy.
---
I put a switch in a separate room behind a keypad door. If they don't know the code they can't unlock it. 
---
Hope that helps :)
---
I mean I can grind 75k caps reliably over the course of a month or two. I wouldn‚Äôt sell any god rolled weapon (I only have like three) for caps, because I can‚Äôt grind a god roll - the odds are astonishing low and you are limited on how many perv rolls you can per day. Imo the only god rolled weapons that for caps are duped ones.
---
saw ghoul as ghost for a split second and remember that those DO exist in universe, where my Spooky shop keep?!
---
I got mine at Sutton Station but had to hop a few times before it showed up
---
Yeah I'm expecting common private server things, what happens on that server stays on that server. I for one I'm ok with it, I rather have had a private coop modded Fallout experience vs a MMO one. I'm not saying the MMO isn't fun and some love that, but I think a lot of the flak they took was simply not making a coop Fallout. These private servers bring that to us and without a cash shop either.
---
Heavy doesn't need Unyielding anyway. And Junkies won't be running with full Adrenal Reaction like a bloodied build will; a proper PA HW Bloodied build will still do a LOT more damage than a junkies build, with a ton of survivability baked in (PA is really tanky in PVE, and you can run Emergency Protocols for even more durability)
---
So I farm Huntsville up to westek. At the start of Huntsville there is always a dead raider, usually with either pre war money or frag grenade. But yesterday they were carrying an assault rifle with 5.56 ammo. I thought this was strange as they never have guns on them to loot. Made me think that this was the start of wastelanders. Like people are starting to return, sending out scouts to survey the area.
---
The fix would be so simple.  All they would have to do is making it so cutting power to the vending machines max them unusable.
---
It‚Äôs been a known issue for a while, I didn‚Äôt know it until I purchased it. I‚Äôve tried putting it on my legendary armor, modded standard armor and even newly crafted armor. Doesn‚Äôt even show as an option.
---
I wrote Bethesda and got the ‚Äúknown issue/working on it‚Äù reply.
---
Yes to all of that, many players would rather play this than MMO Fallout.
---
Shit man get over it 
---
Until I got to about lvl 75 I was constantly griefed and harassed and hell at that time that would not only kill you but blow up your camp.
---
If you are overclocking the turn down your overclock.
---
So I‚Äôm not allowed to voice an opinion but he is? You must think it‚Äôs all okay then lol, encourage the toxics

If I could get decent rolls on legendaries I would have a usable 3* weapon or armor pieces lol. My luck is bad.
---
Really?  So the lvl 80 with an explosive laser cheese cannon that shredded me at a workshop was griefing?  I‚Äôm lvl 250 so excuse the hell out of me!!!
---
Private servers for purchase first, the 'free' stuff by March 2020.
---
Not gonna wait...I'd rather watch Netflix on my new super duper Sony and check out Steam.
---
im not
---
It hides your backpack. Sometimes I like that, sometimes I find it annoying. I have different skins for armor plated, high capacity, and normal backpacks so I can see without pulling up the pop boy.
---
I'm actively playing Atlas, and I played Ark for a stupid amount of time. I enjoy the occasional Conan Exiles.
---
All on non-dedicated local servers. I just want to play with my husband alone in the wasteland. 
---
We still buy DLC for Conan, too. I hope Bethesda isn't afraid that non-dedis will stop buying Atom Shop items because we would definitely still buy stuff.
---
I just got it from the top of the world ski resort vendor, went from 29,000 caps to 19,000
---
I hear you. I've dropped off the game entirely until we get proper private servers. Just being able to tweak a few settings here and there would already be a huge improvement, though obviously mods would be even better.
---
It could be confusing, sure. The system should explain what just happened. 
---
If it is a choice between a buyer wondering why they can't buy that next thing, and them buying all the things and me losing caps... or me having to really carefully scrutinize what I am selling... I vote for my convenience.
---
No it all depends on your intelligence and luck from what I‚Äôve read, try and get a few piece of unyielding armor, low lvl if you don‚Äôt run that type of perk, plus you get more from scrapping too
---
Not that I've noticed. When I make homemades to scrap for plans I just craft them at lvl 15.
---
Kind of a noob question I guess...but sometime taking that perfect pic will get you killed...question is, is it possible to record say a 30 second fight and then go back and crop it or select the best frame?
---
If it's trash mobs I think anything is fair game, but legendary creatures are obviously another story, especially for events with known spawns and bosses.  I make exceptions if I'm participating in low-level events and there are actual lowbies present, giving them a chance to tag before I kill anything.
---
Level 48 on my alt and I dare anyone to fight.  I'll even be naked and use my level 10 pipe rifle.
---
Not really, just making a point.  It's the build that matters, above all else.  Crits beat endgame armor all day.  Doesn't matter who you are, what gear you have.  A stealth boy is your only chance vs a minmax crit commando.
---
If Bethesda made an invisible armor paint job in the atom shop, they would make a ton just off that alone.
---
So maybe underarmors are dope and I dont want to run a no armor build just to utilize them.
---
I wanted the football thing ever since it was leaked. But it turned out into underarmor, so I didnt buy it.
---
Lol, half a page full of insults.  Yup.  Definitely not mad.  Everyone believes you.  :)
---
If true whoever made it is a true hero. It‚Äôs like Neo killed an army of agent smithüëçüèª
---
I didn‚Äôt even know Hermit Crabs were in the game until I walked up to a truck while in the Mire and all of the sudden it span around and punched me in the face.
---
Quite some time ago I suggested the ability to hire the insult bot to send after your friends for Atoms.
---
A Mr. Handy that delivers mail would be great.
---
A Mr. Handy that wanders your camp repairing half broken camp items would be great.
---
A Mr. Handy that picks the weeds and other items that cannot be bulldozed in a camp would be great.
---
More cosmetics would be great.
---
Buying new music for the radio would be great.
---
Being able to pay money to advertise a player run event on the map with a special icon would be great.
---
I would pay out the nose for things like this, bit screw anything that lets people pay to dodge game mechanics or get an advantage over others who don't have the cash to shell out for game bucks.
---
I bought that, thinking u could just shoot it off whenever, and was very disappointed when it did nothing but light up. The pics in the atom shop showed it blasting off, so I just thought it was bugged
---
ok
---
I really don't know why people are screeching about private servers being paid for. Of course they are, it's a totally additional thing they are providing that actually requires investment on thier part and active upkeep. Loads of games charge for servers.
---
I'm all for shitting on Bethesda, god knows they deserve it but let's be real. Paying for a server isn't an issue
---
I‚Äôve got mine in little rooms with the vending machine part showing in the doorway, when I don‚Äôt want it to be selling I add a door and lock it and turn them off
---
i think a good chunk of the playerbase wants enclave themed stuff. This is all good ideas. I too would where an X-01 Skin for like ever. 
---
my concern is they go full Fallout 4 on the faction and have a small gesture about them (questline in 76) but nothing else happens. My hopes for the best that they will listen to faction feedback
---
I made a suggestion a while back to add a perk that allows the player to use fist weapons with power armour, but the people who commented told me it would be way too overpowered and unbalanced.
---

Yes. And dont take it personal when the launcher forgets your install directory. It's not sentient... yet.

How many nerds know Glitch Mob?
---
 I'm a little surprised
---
Am wishing right now you can set the brown doggy bags on fire....maybe in 2020?

The marine tactical is probably faster than repeatedly clearing the mole miners and selling their junk near white springs.
---
^ This! My second character is a bloodied unyielding build. She learns a mod almost every time she scraps a weapon. My main has scrapped 2-300 handmades and still doesn‚Äôt have two mods unlocked.
---
If I wanted a 1\* legendary I'd go kill the SBQ LOLOL , seriously tho, I use 1\* bloodied handmade on my bloodied guy. I think if you had some cool 1\* lower level weapons and armor I'd buy them for a new character or something. Depends what it is I guess, if you sell the "good stuff" as you mentioned I would think theyd do well.
---
I'd have to check tomorrow, not going to be around my PC tonight. But I'll get back to you.
---
The ee harpoon looks very fun. Put flachete on it and play around in vault.
---
No, level doesnt matter, the body part doesnt matter either. Iirc, there are some mods that you cant learn from scrapping, you have to buy those plans
---
I agree but how about not announcing something new and release dates until it is actually ready?
---
Canned coffee. 
---
I just learned it gives you nearly invite stamina. When I'm carrying 1000 lbs of items to sell, the train station can't come fast enough.
---
Recipe please.
---
Actually I think this game was in fact MEANT to be as OP described their way of playing it. The fact that the majority bash it for not being otherwise is just a testament to how trashy popular games are nowadays. All those people who grind to min/max just to ‚Äúdominate endgame‚Äù and what not are completely missing the point of this game, in my opinion. Good riddance to them I say if it doesn‚Äôt hold their attention.
---
I was legit just about to do this and would like an answer too please and thanks
---
That sounds more like it's a "backronym" than anything, the word meta existed for a long time before people started calling it "most effective tactic available".
---
PHRASING!!
---
Goodies of my haul...
---
- Explosive Junkies 10mm sub +1Agility
---
- Two shot explosive Fixer +1Perception
---
- x2 Quad Tesla rifles
---
I don't see why it wouldn't be possible.
---
Oof. Sounds like someone didn‚Äôt get the 3 star legendary they were hoping for from the purveyor after spending several thousand of scrips.....
---
What truly baffles me is that many high level players have nothing but trash in their vendings. I come across many 300+ guys sitting in their camp selling voice of set for 3k and all rise for 5k. Some don‚Äôt even have those, only ‚Äòsharpshooters‚Äô stuff and still big price tag. That made me believe there‚Äôs indeed a market for expensive garbage.
---
Do you know if somebody made a list of unlearnable mods from scrapping or just a general list of every mod? Don't want to get to the point where I'm scrapping hundreds of parts for a mod I can't unlock that way.
---
Tfw you spend hours getting the get good gear and vault tec take it away
---
These stories of repeated worshop murder always make me wonder why the person getting lit up continues to come back to a fight they clearly can't win.
---
No worse so than the lack of multiple roof options or ceilings.
---
It would be a good idea to start teasing it.  Like a distant radio signal that sounds like harsh static when it first gets added, but as Wastelanders get closer, it becomes more clear and eventually becomes an audible message from trying to reach anybody in Appalachia.
---
No bargainin with murmrgh
---
As it I now I feel the relationship between scavvers and hardcore grinders is fairly symbiotic, so I just hope they don't add more things that passively collect the mats, ammo and aid I'm currently selling so that I'll in turn be able to afford to buy their legendaries. It would be fairly game-breaking for me personally if they are effective at least.
---
They are just people who've gone crazy due to the pain of the suits collapsing in on them
---
Are there more pictures for this?
---
yea I guess i was worried that if you're addicted you HAVE to keep using them once in a while or the negative effects get worse (withdrawal) or something like that.  That'd be terrible.
---
Nope! Skinniest bait ever. How are we supposed to attract scorchbeasts with you being so thin??
---
AA is pretty good but Junkies is stronger than AA (50% buff vs 30%) if you‚Äôre into addictions. TSE is also stronger than AAE if you don‚Äôt rely on vatbot.
---
Nope, Bethesda hasn't detected any occurences of the bug since they implemented their fix.
---
it is, with the method I said it's really easy to craft. its like 1 cloth 1 glass and 3 rubber per mask and with super duper you can craft multiples per craft usually. with just max bargin its 28 caps. if you use mentants or anything you can get it way up to like 35c each.
---
They could easily give the vendor machines an internal caps inventory so that once the player gets rid of some of their caps they can pick up any left, instead you, you know, just DELETING THEM and also you lose the item you were selling.
---
But I guess its crazy to think you should be able to sell something with out losing all the proceeds from it.
---
As the majority of the people who bought this game, I haven't played f76 in at least 3 months :P there is nothing to do. And I didn't even had the best legendaries, it was just that I had a infinite supply of everything and decent enough gear so there is actually 0 reason to keep playing unless you're like op and just like to wonder around doing nothing :P
---
This is close to the setup that I have. My generator is behind a keypad door. And my switch is behind another door that's locked. When the switch is flicked, the vendors shut off and two garage doors close them up tight, and my neon OPEN sign even shuts off.
---
Funny story: I hit 29k caps last weekend and I went to close up my shop and someone was using one of my crafting tables. I turned off the switch and went Chameleon behind my door, which doubles as my bedroom, since I was going to go AFK for a few minutes. Well, I guess he still had some shopping to do, and he saw the doors closed. Then, he started looking for a switch. He found my decon shower switch, used that switch and he found that didn't work. 
---
Then he found my locked door. And, he picked the lock, which made him wanted. I was going to let it slide and just turn off the switch again and then I got the notification... SoAndSo just bought your Stable Yellowcake Flux... 10 of them for 1500, putting me over cap limit. I turned off my switch, walled up my door and killed him for the trouble. I am NOT a PvP player, but I few sneak crit shots to the head from my AA Handmade put him down. Then I server hopped and I went and bought a serum recipe to get me down to a comfortable level again. Still hovering around 25k and need to buy stuff so I can sell my Fixer plan this weekend. First Wasteland Problems, right?
---
Oh, I did not take his junk either. I'm not that horrible.
---
And yes, I realize I lived up to my username. But, the door was locked for a reason, dude.
---
Vast majority of higher level folks I have come across are generally really cool people. I'm 117 myself. The only time I go after someone is if they mess up my friends and take their stuff
---
Bruh I spend on average 15k a day on cards. I get em at 1750 a pop. I do it cause it's one of my favorite events. Yeah selling the plans gets me easy caps sometimes but I just pulling that bitch from Hell and going to town on her and her spawns. I've also gotten my friends into the habit of calling her a bitch from hell too which gives me a giggle. I honestly wish we had more events like that cause right now encrypted and queen fights are basically the only events I do in between trading and making bock,hefe, and drugs for pvpers.
---
You can connect a flamethrower trap connected to a remote button to make it more smooth. It just doesn't go high enough, looks more like a missfire
---
You're a hero.
---
All weapons should have legendary variants, but the downside is that the drop pool will be bigger and less chance of receiving the drop you desire.
---
I hear its been fine since the last patch and it was a very rare occurrence when it did happen so I think it's safe to say your stuff is fine.
---
Oh, they'll open it for modders. Why? A goodly chunk of the paints and who knows what all else are mods from 4. And that kills me. üòê So there will be a creation kit. But please, for the love of god, I hope they call it something else. Creation kit only really makes sense on the creation engine...
---
I did not care for NW at launch but I love the Morgantown map. I've got a pretty set routine and my goal is always to make it to the endgame, where anything can happen. I've managed to grab some solo wins, that's always satisfying.
---
I've still got a long way to go before I exhaust the unlockables but once I do I won't play as much
---
Hmm, that is a lot of resources. I can kill the mole miners with melee and sell their weapons for 25 caps plus all their garbage. Maybe I will have to try both. But either way you are still capped at caps per day.
---
Important aspect of dealing damage are quite often critical hits. Truth being told, quite often it's more important to have high frequency of crits than to have high crits. Faster fire rate means more critical hits in a same time period.
---
Sweet mother of god. Seriously?! Please tell me you're kidding!
---
Keep it up my dudes, lovin it
---
Exactly! So there you have it! The reason no one buys skins is that there aren't enough of them to cover all of the weapons.
---
At least 2.
---
Nice! 
---
Does it have flat land around it? Or a water source?
---
This is a complicated question that's dependent on current state of playstyles within the community.
---
Yesterday I'd say commando sneaky snipers are best, and for PvE they are the most universal shredders.
---
For PvP, since yesterday, I believe rifleman sneaky snipers are the best.
---
Confession:
---
*braces for downvotes*
---
I actually found her really obnoxious...
---
Damn dude I‚Äôve been trying for ever to get that roll on a handmade!!! :(
---
Which sort of defeats them wanting us to buy atoms. "Of course" well6still be able to buy atoms. But right now, we don't have much reason to WANT to.
---
Damn that‚Äôs tough!!! I‚Äôll reply in 2 hours to tell you what I get on today‚Äôs haul lol
---
I think private servers are simply awesome, have enough people to kickstart a community, and plan to have network of PvP and PvE servers adjusted to the audience expectations.
---
No more queues. No more looking for each other when trying to find opponents.
---
I‚Äôve earned my atomic shop items. Anyone can get atoms for playing. Multiple characters make it even easier. I just grinded my way to the wallpaper set AFTER I zero‚Äôd out on the robot when it released. 
---
I would hope they increased the stash to 1200 or make character to character inventory boxes ex: atomic cloud
---
I've always wanted to know why people buy the underarmor when you cant ever see it!
---
Yea but it‚Äôs bullshit. They need to squash that beef so we can talk and direct other players there. If you mention this sub on there they don‚Äôt delete your comments at least.
---
Nice job congratulations
---
Cool i will look for it. Doing my rerolls tonight in 4 hours
---
Nukesanddragons has a character planner tool that is super helpful.  Don‚Äôt be confused - it actually makes it easier because your voices are not permanent - I would spend some time planning your build at nukesadndragons to get a rough idea of what you want to do and then just know that you will be able to tweak things after level 50 if your plan changes ...
---
This will help plan your build. https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
The AA50 cal is probably the best. The AA gatling laser is good. Furious double barrel also. Instigating 44 pistol is ok.
---
Instigating combat rifle is good.  The instigating pipe pistol has 250dr which is bugged. That would be a great Fixer if it was not a Ghoul slayer.
---
Nah, chrome minigun, greenhouse dome, welcome home sign, gold handmade, rockeygirl suit.
---
actually, the raider and free States might be the first rereleases we've had (?)
---
Thats a cool idea. Bethesda listen to our suggestions!
---
Heres a google doc I made long ago that has an armor mod checklist, broken down into mod type, body part, armor type, etc
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LdNVotf_h9DnpsK2mHU-LkJPNfTy-3a8zpePSn-3WQ/edit?usp=drivesdk
---
Theres two other sheets that has plans you could find at vendors (most likely out of date).
---
Im looking through some of my saved posts, I think I had one saved that had the learn chances from scrapping. Someone else made it I believe from datamining fo76 files on pc. Some of it seemed inaccurate to me, there were some I learned from scrapping where the op claimed it wasnt possible.
---
Ill add a comment if I find it.
---
Past fallout games:
---
* Fallout 1: Level 21 cap
---
* Fallout 2: level 99 cap
---
* fallout 3: level 20 cap, increased to 30 by a DLC.  
---
* NV started at 30 and each DLC raised it up to a max of 50.
---
fo4 was the only game that really allowed players to become gods with literally every perk and SPECIAL stat maxed out thanks to the fact it has no level cap at all.  
---
But you really had to plan out a build in fo3 and nv when those games launched because once you hit the cap, that's it you were done picking perks and ranking up skills.
---
I also think it's factually incorrect that "This is the only Fallout where you can only be good at one thing".  Everyone of my characters can switch between at least 2 completely different perk loadouts and then use different weapons.  Every one of my characters can swap in master lock pick and master hacker perks at any time and then swap them out when done with no sacrifice of any kind to my offense/defense.
---
I can go on but it would take an essay to properly explain all of this and I don't see how it matters in the end.  my opinions, or those of the op, are unlikely to ever reach anyone who makes decisions :P
---
I'm personally not opposed to them as long as they aren't acting toxic or anything. tried rolling with a play organized BOS faction, but it wasn't really my thing.
---
Love it. Great idea. +1 
---
No more panic logging off
---
Same thing I think about with people who are in militias or into civil war reenactments
---
Serums. People sell serums for 150-200 caps all the time. They sell at vendors with Cha 2, Hard Bargain 2 and a grape mentats for 433 caps. Sell 3 and some other junk, make your daily cap cap everyday in 15 seconds.
---
Do Encryptid. The Fixer plans sell very well. You can hoard them, or be opportunistic and sell them during a 50% off scrip sale to people hoping to get god roll Fixers. Easy 15k - 20k on Xbox One.
---
Awesome! Sounds terrific! :D
---
Love this, Ive played for 350 hours or so, and still only level 155, because Im just enjoying it
---
Never really enjoyed minecraft, but through this game I finally get the appeal
---
Did you stand in the center of ground zero and laugh in the face of death as the nuke came down on you?
---
I did.
---
Hmm, thought some of them rolled over. My friend had that issue (bug?) and was actually complaining. He goes "Floop, I would rather go to work and make 40 cents in five minutes than do these kill robot challenges again."
---
Sounds fair. It‚Äôs supposed to be an acronym meaning ‚Äúmost effective tactics available‚Äù :)
---
Man and just imagine if they gave us the ability to make our own
---
Take your upvote and start digging.

damnit! I tried this awhile back, was not that great lol
---
Nice try Bethesda. I'm still not playing your shit game.
---
Explain...
---
Self Explanitory.
---
I was just saying elsewhere that I think it's fine if it's just trash mobs.  There are a ton of solid places to farm mats and weapons that aren't timed events.  (Breach and Clear comes to mind.  I love that event when I need bullets and scrap for caps.)  There's some give and take here, though.  I think lowbies should be farming events that are their level, while simultaneously it's important to give them a chance if you're showing up to a lower level event yourself.
---
It confused the F outta me on my main,till I gotta grip essentially.But dependent on yer play style...
---
Yer gonna wanna allocate points into whatever kinda build ya wanna strive fer essentially.
---
Do you wanna be a builder?
---
A salesmen?
---
Regarding yer fighting skills,ya kinda wanna ‚Äúpick a play style that ya dig,&amp; build towards that. 
---
Big guns,small guns,rifle,handgun,just melee?
---
Is not ‚Äútough‚Äù,too be a jack of all trades,but I feel the benefits aren‚Äôt really there,
---
cause in my experience it‚Äôs something ya wanna build for,until Lvl 50,
---
then ya can start re-allocatin ‚ÄúS.P.E.C.I.A.L‚Äù Points ,
---
kinda tweaking yer semi essentially already built character.
---
The possibilities are as endless,
---
as are the resources too build a great character...dependent on the response ya get from here,
---
or the time ya got too go through a lil bit O research.
---
I‚Äôd do unspeakable things for cheap cryo cells
---
Momma said I'm handsome and you're jealous.

Thanks for the heads up!
---
While true, the origin comes from greek to mean overreaching, or in a nutshell, using information outside the scope of the item to gain an advantage. 
---
The iteration used in Fallout however is the more commonly used acronym for gaming meaning "most effective tactic available"
---
While it started out as a prefix, and still exists in this form in some cases today, in gaming it is now used in its acronym form.
---
I'd love to run the vault. Is it still deleting peoples items? If not

It was fun my peoplesss. See you next week!! Round two is gonna be Robots! A menace p2w scheme, or a useless rubber collector!
---
HELL YES! I remember when me and some old buddies managed to get a dead server to ourselves and we ran two man teams on each silo and launched on each other. When we finished launch we stood on our silos and watched as death came, laughing and ragging on each other. Good memories.
---
GrIeFeR!!1!1

Good memory! I have the greenhouse dome too. They did the blackbird paint too. And the current plague riders
---
Are you SURE? I got a fixer from murgh and I don‚Äôt know the plan.
---
I haven't got the hours but I feel you sir. Day one of the beta and I still love this game with the irritations all. Your poetic story brings forth a need to kill, rape and pillage, but also brings the need to support guide and coop with those of a newer vintage. I hoist a vintage nukeshine to you and wonder where the hell I'll end up this time lol
---
Ugh. Not to mention the stair case goes in the middle of a tile and cant have railings on either side. Metal railings, half and full length, and stairs that fit to one side of the tile, this is my camp wish. 
---
The question is, how many atoms is it gonna cost me?
---
I've been doing raids for the past month or so (after the fix was implemented) and haven't had anything bad happen to myself or any teammates.  Your stuff is safe.
---
I Roll wit a few members from the PKOA,

I get bummed sometimes when I can‚Äôt get on &amp; jam wit em.

But ya know,RL comes first,&amp; even that being said,when I get a sec too chat or get on.

So I guess it‚Äôs all about what you like playing,

Well when you finish that one sir, I got stock all brewed and ready and we can have ourselves one hell of an adventure.
---
Watch you get downvoted for a reasonable suggestion
---
I was standing at the fast travel spawn point at The Whitespring when a nuke was targeted. I needed the trophy so I stayed put. Some low level shows up and starterd frantically running back and forth. I Gave him a thumbs up and the gasy looking emote a split second before we were reduced to ash piles.
---
For a primary legendary effect, it seems like it should apply to everything.... just my .02.  If it were a 2nd or 3rd effect I could see more limitations
---
What do you recommend heading into the vault with? PA? Lots of stimpacks?
---
Dig it!!
---
AA works on explosive damage
---
"light wood laminate light wood laminate light wood laminate"
---
Same, the game gets so boring withous them.
---
That's both hilarious and something I've never considered.
---
If you have the wild wasteland perk in fnv just as youre leaving Goodsprings towards primm there‚Äôs a skeleton in a fridge with a fedora on
---
Yeah I'm pretty confident Bethesda wouldn't chose to "ruin their game" by accommodating a tiny minority of players if we were in fact such a minority, it's a silly claim.
---
I think the people who don't monitor their caps and then turn off their vendors are the issue. A stash of caps in the vendor is a cap limit increase. 
---
I have 28k caps. My vendor is full of 5 cap plans and I don't loot every single thing I see because I don't need too.
---
Looool I love it. I remember back in summer, there was about 8 low levels running through Morgantown, doing Biv Quest I guess or messing around idk. But I launched on the town and be damned if every single one stayed in that town as death came, I give em props cause I remember standing in power armor waiting for my first nuke to land, not realizing that PA wasnt gonna save me loool
---
Dedicated servers are the only way to allow someone to have their own server where friends arent tethered to them. Dedicated servers cost a lot of money, Bethesda has to charge for it. That's all.
---
There have been no confirmed reports of it deleting items since they adressed the issue. On the same post, they said that they would restore your account if something goes wrong in the vault
---
I got a JSS+ strength death tambo i‚Äôm excited to sell
---
Where is your proper English..?
---
This is funny as hell. I'm gonna continue to help them sell private servers just for the fun of it by this logic. Lmao.
---
Boodied  melee no need heavy weapon it's so powerful a fast knife or one hand sword is more than enough.

I‚Äôm not gonna lie,I ONLY started playing when the news of that update surfaced,been playing since...

I was straight angry fer about 5 minutes at the news of the delay,but as previously stated,the transparency,&amp; just the fact that they wanted too polish it before they let us have at er‚Äô
---
I can appreciate.
---
I eagerly await it,when they do decide too drop it.
---
TIL there is a max caps limit
---
You should of took a screen shot
---
That would be epic, maybe a hermit crab that uses a house or a plane as its shell lol
---
üò≠üò≠üò≠
---
Are you wanted?
---
Wait is that true of all legendaries. You need say gatlin gun plans to get gatling guns
---
So my nocturnal, underwater breathing level 25 wood armour might earn me some caps????
---
Well God damn your smart lmao. Yeah I've never been wanted before so I guess thats why. Thank you !
---
Agreed. This should have been a borderlands style 4player coop and left it at that. It would have been a much better experience. If these private servers are modder friendly, then I‚Äôm all over it. I‚Äôve been beating the drum to let modders fix all the bugs like they‚Äôve done with past Fallouts.
---
Not even a little bit. Just go look at the sets of possible cinditions over a week or so, you'll see each of those three pop up at least once, so yeah, should you choose to you can totally take on the Deathclaw on Deathclaw Island, Naked, welding a Protest Sign, for 10 Atoms. It really ought to be worth more lol.
---
Lol. No problem. Just ask someone to take you out real quick &amp; all will be right again.
---
Talons mutation applies.  I wonder if the bleed effects stack.
---
We call them people exploiters
---
I was thinking the same thing. I'm all for them releasing *finished* DLC, of course, so I don't want them to release it until it's finished. But they also shouldn't tell their fan base that it'll be done in November, if they have no idea whether it'll be done by then or not.
---
And don't forget to store all your junk first just in case
---
Can't remember the last time I bothered equipping a lock picking/hacking card for anything.  Not like there's much to bother with in those safes.
---
Keep on keeping on, Ghoul
---
No one had ever been named for the over the stash limit glitch and the threshold for being banned on duped items is 100k+ rare items. They arent going to get banned.
---
Two ice cream salesmen on a beach, the optimal (for the clients) solution.
---
I'll just say that we've had very different experiences regarding this event.  The majority of my experience has been the first to spot throwing up a follow emote.  Even when that doesn't happen players are often just nice enough to at least give a chance at tagging the thing.  Same for the Free Range event, the whole purpose is the one legendary that spawns and one shotting it is just lame.  
---
As an aside, your being okay with losing out on the event doesn't extrapolate to everyone else being okay with it where they you.
---
1400 hours here.  Lvls 170x2, 155x2, 153.  Likely will be here turning the lights out at last call in (hopefully) a few years.
---
I‚Äôve scrapped a gilded minigun, hoping it would allow me to learn the paint job. It didn‚Äôt.
---
I walked overloaded from most of lvl 30-100 on my first character because I was perpetually overweight.  To the point I sold rare outfits (unknown to me at the time) to free up stash space.  Can anyone imagine a 400lb stash now??
---
I was arguing with people that int raised XP for months before people at large finally ‚Äúgot it‚Äù (which was odd since you could test it yourself with berry mentats).
---
Met a lot of great people in this game, still meeting more, and yet I still solo 95% of the time.  Maybe year two will be the year of the group!
---
May all your legendaries be 3 stars!
---
I thought 30 was the maximum but today I noticed one of my special was 32.
---
Fair enough, considering playing any video game is essentially ‚Äúdoing nothing‚Äù in the grand scheme of things (other than entertaining yourself I suppose). I guess it‚Äôs just a matter of what flavor of doing nothing you prefer.
---
People keep bringing up what other games do as proof that characters won't be transferable from private servers like that is just how it is with private servers. From the perspective of the developers, it makes the most sense to have them transferable and is consistent with the decisions they've made in the past. 
---
I think you've nailed it exactly in how they are going to work in F76. It is just a regular server that you can play by yourself or with a few friends. A new character won't be needed and there will be no special settings that prevent you from taking that loot you gained in private back to the public server because it won't ruin the economy in the public server. 
---
The real concern though for me, if that does turn out to be how it is, is how private mod servers will work. I can see the modding being allowed only through some type of limited creation kit that only allows certain things to be done. No scripting or anything crazy like with the really big mods, just mostly stuff that we currently see in the Atomic Shop but as player-made. Or hell, they might even go back to that idea of selling player mods in the Atomic Shop and giving the mod author a portion of the money, who knows. Even though you're right with what they're going to do IMO, it concerns me about the future of modding in this game and I don't think it is a coincidence that they've said basically nothing about modding in a year other than that it is coming eventually. One of my biggest hopes for this game was to have some amazing mods that could be played in multiplayer similar to Sim Settlements or Fallout Commander but with other players. I'm starting to think this is just a fantasy and never going to be a reality in this game.
---
Honestly this would be awesome and add an extra element of roleplaying. Sadly I have a feeling it would turn toxic and develop into a war. Why? Cause war never changes....
---
I‚Äôve heard that brawling works but doesn‚Äôt show up in the damage numbers. Also it doesn‚Äôt stack so only use it on one arm.
---
But that is just what I‚Äôve read on this sub so it might not be accurate.
---
I'm not bothered. Lol
---
Yea that fixer would be fun to use if it was a better prefix! I have an AA handmade with the same rolls and it‚Äôs nasty!!
---
The question is:
---
When will there be **personal** private servers that communities could host, mod, and substantially transform the game that are separate from the official severs completely.
---
The current private official server model has to be paid. Its comparable to if 3-4 people took a large passenger plane that was designed to hold 24 people. So to cover additional costs for a private server, you have to pay a little.
---
I want dual wielding... but that'll never happen
---
If I were to guess, the reason NPC's are not in the game up to now is that it creates a multiplexing state challenge to handle in an online game, and they were not put in the original release as it wasn't easy to resolve.  I would expect that has been fixed but likely requires a non-trivial change, either to the protocol, API, or schema.
---
But, they could do a more rudimentary NPC like Grahm, but you wouldn't have a forked-dialog-stream type thing like you expect from NPCs.
---
It would be cool just to see random laconic NPC's showing up scouting, however, and that would be better than nothing!
---
If your on xbox I would of sold you one for 5k!
---
Under that shack against the mountainside you can place a music instrument to get into the rock. There should be water in there. I have seen someone elses camp there awhile back.
---
Preach it brother.
---
76 end game, the pepper grind.
---
Any idea of the grand total of atoms ? I'm sure you've spent some along the way but maybe a guesstimation?
---
Yeah you're totally right. Is just that, just wandering around and playing farming simulator is not what I wanted for th3ia game, but totally understand people who enjoy it. Glad you do haha
---
you can use stuff like shadowplay, OBS, SLOBS, Nvidia highlights and many more its just the part of finding which one u like and all that. The one that I usually use would be SLOBS / Nvidia highlights But nvidia requires nvidia product or just videocard
---
+karma thanks!
---
!! Im going to look for that
---
Yeah, totally in favor of this.
---
Being able to mark Legendarys during events, or Bobbleheads and Magazines while looting, or marking an enemies location if you can't tag the enemy themselves for some reason.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs possible. It even says that in the patch notes when the added them to the purveyor. You probably know it and didn‚Äôt realize it maybe.
---
I'm on PS4
---
I think Nuke Zones are a little different to be fair.  I'm not going to tag a legendary in whitesprings and then run out and let everyone know I found one, etc.  For scorched earth though I get where you're coming from.  I run a stealth sniper build and I'm much better suited to just mowing down all the extra pulls and in the chaos sometimes one-shot a legendary before I realize it.
---
Not to mention that designing the game to be in a listen server model would be incredibly challenging and they'd essentially be developing another watered down version of the game with tons of issues given there would have to be a tethered distance to the host player. 
---
I dont know if people can truly appreciate the technical accomplishment of fo76. Its really incredible from a game design perspective and they made a lot of the right choices.
---
Build Limit.  They are a place to play around with building things.  Too bad there isn't a way to specify if you want to PvP or not, so the PvP people ruin any other aspect of a workshop. And the line that you knew you were getting into it when you took the workshop is as realistic as saying you knew your car could get stolen when you park it on the street, so you shouldn't be upset when it is stolen.
---
Hey you know there is a really bad glich
---
No you idiot, the PvP you open yourself up to is somebody trying to take your workshop away from you.  
---
Getting the kill and waiting for the respawn to get another kill is the exact opposite of what workshop PvP is for.
---
And that is why the workshops are a useless part of the game.
---
Ahah, thank you!
---
I‚Äôve never heard of this
---
Sweet! Bethesda, make this happen!!!
---
Nice, thanks :)
---
Maybe they thought it would be overPOWERed
---
It is a catch 22 for them. If they are planning it, but dont announce it, and put their development time into it without letting people know what they are doing, they will be accused of not creating content or leaving the game to die. Plus they have to listen to players requesting human NPCs but not be able to say "we hear you and we are working on it". If they announce it, and delay it, they get crapped on for setting unrealistic timelines or being incompetent, or just letting people down.
---
The other thing is that this is a *big* change potentially. There are probably a lot of moving parts that could affect systems in ways no one expected. Maybe human npcs spawn totally naked, or fall through the world, or don't interact with the environment right or any number of completely insane bugs. Its just part of developing software, games or otherwise.
---
For what it's worth, I am really disappointed Wastelanders is delayed, but I appreciate their honesty. I also kind of suspect they delayed it because they have bigger plans than initially suggested. Maybe companions will be able to follow outside of camps, maybe there will be *more* settlements than just the two. A man can dream.
---
It been broken for a while now, I painted some combat armour months back.  
---
Then took it off to sell and found I couldn't paint my new stuff. Can still craft the camo short suit though.
---
Thank you for your bravery
---
Imagine theres no heaven.. above us only sky...
---
This sucks man. I only found out today since I got two nice pieces for my set and now they look like an eye sore. I hope it gets fixed soon but I doubt it since no one complains. Might file a refund ticket
---
bought mine at Top of the World
---
Wish I was on console.  I'd be all over the offer myself.
---
emoji police get on the ground
---
Dude, I laugh at folks talking about another increase when I remember being at about 3,000 lbs for tons of my beginning time cause I couldn't fit in my stash.
---
I remember doing my first bloodied build right before the nerf for two shots.
---
I remember the old ice cooler at the Tennis Court being full of legendaries after a nuke, so many good pieces dropped off in it simply cause we didnt know.
---
I remember the glitched out Tennis courts being so stacked with Ghouls that the frame rate crashed people out.
---
Imagine paying for TV.
---
May you find your God rolls and enjoy your adventures
---
Yes they do, to an extremely limited extent, because until Wastelanders comes out, they're all either dead or have left Appalachia. So if hundreds of vault dwellers suddenly are walking around in Enclave or Brotherhood attire, at a time when the Brotherhood has not yet returned to Appalachia (and the existing local BoS members are all dead), and the Enclave are all dead at the hands of MODUS (except for those who were not located in Appalachia)... how would that fit the lore, exactly?
---
I'll keep trucking till turn the servers off. Not a day earlier!
---
Good news, you can stack drink str and food str -

Only saw it once from a vendor, don‚Äôt remember which. Bought it right away. It‚Äôs supposedly rare...
---
Imagine paying for internet
---
that's why i play stealth sniper. i'm too cheap with bullets. ;)
---
Thanks for this! Would you mind archiving the existing ones that are still in play if this is the direction you're going?
---
no, just the event only plans
---
Fixer, Sheepsquatch, Bear arm.
---
These typically only pop in the purveyor if you have the plan.
---
7600 hours?
---
Yeah it is rare and costs alot
---
Only make legendaries fall through the floor, I'm always thrilled about that!
---
Mothman is skinnier than I remember
---
They have a glitched out stash box from the early days. Leave em be. He has to suffer with the fact he can store a single item in that stash box till he empties it back out.
---
That is one challenge left, spend 7600 hours in-game. Since that one can't be done any other way than simply playing and wait, nothing can be done to clear it immediately and I can't do anything about it.
---
Dude, I go through bullets like crazy, with or without automatics. Whenever I used single shots I still had to hit them 11 or 12 times to kill
---
Why do people want to be hyped well in advance of the launch? It's almost as if if they don't get constantly drip-fed teasers that they will lose interest or forget about the DLC altogether.
---
I'm much more of a fan of Bethesda's usual plan - say nothing right up until close to launch. No itchy feet, no impending sense of doom if things don't look like they're going in the right direction, no urge of wanting the game to come out sooner so you can release that hype pressure valve etc.
---
I paid 9-10k at a robot vendor
---
Lmao thank fuck it's not just me..got an instigating........fuck it its gone
---
What this guy is saying. There are griefers at every level. Just the higher levels ones tend to be more successful at it.
---
I bought mine from one of the robot vendors, a while back, but can't recall which one. I've actually seen it at the vendors two times.
---
They fixed the bug where you could get 8, yeah? I wish I had 8.
---
According to Bethesda no. But guess what, last night I lost a complete armor set while NOT in Vault 94 and support replied they have no way of restoring vanished items. You're not safe anywhere.
---
The kegs have been in the files since the brewing update, if not earlier. They can release them any time they want.
---
Look at all that budget you saved!
---
I don‚Äôt know how to link to an old reddit post, but it was from August 2017 and this question was asked with regards to Blizzard.  Different company and game, I know.  But the overwhelming response was something akin to ‚Äúyes, if Blizzard ran it.‚Äù  I know there are differences but the people spoke and they spoke loud and clearly saying essentially that they would ‚Äúpay for private servers run by a company they like to play a game they love.‚Äù  This comment is neither here nor there.  Not making any great point, except to say that sometimes will surprise you what people want/are willing to pay for.
---
And where is the firecracker whiskey recipe?
---
Every faction is dead. Your argument is flawed.
---
Ouch
---
I paid 9,600 now I have 19,000, before I had 29,000
---
Also, where the keg are the fork plans?
---
Only 20 atoms for 7600 hours?
---
Is it trying to run on the APU graphics instead of the full fat RX card? Pretty sure the program will shit itself trying to run with the APU.
---
76 smackaroos a week!
---
I thought that this was going to be a post about all the dad's and granddads playing this game. Feel jebaited now.
---
Just tv, or other content? Over the air tv is free.
---
I have 2, but it says I have 4 built, when I don't
---
Sweet thanks man
---
How do u prevent them from just running through ur walls while camp is loading in
---
It'd be nice if they randomised the title screen so it's not the same one every time. I like each of the title screens. Just gets tiring seeing the same one constantly.
---
Uh oh.  Are you not supposed to emoji on reddit? This is a serious question.  I am not like, an experienced user.
---
Explosive add up to 32% damage so if you're already using the demo cards it's more damage output.
---
Which platform?
---
What? I thought that they fixed that a while back.
---
Terrible, and my scrip hasn't reset even though it's been over 24 hours since I last turned in anything. So I've got 50 pounds worth of useless legendaries on me because my stash is full.
---
I remember buying my very first TSE Gatling Plasma for 250 caps, before they stopped making them when energy weapons were shit.   I thought to myself, they will fix this one day, and they did.
---
Now noone can afford it.  And its still in my stash.
---
I remember hitting lvl 4 in flatwoods and accidentally hitting some lvl 50s camp with my machette because i didnt know camp damage makes you wanted.   Then getting squashed by mr almighty power armor when he came for revenge.
---
I remember taking 45 minutes to get a stable log in that didnt freeze immediately.
---
I remember ...
---
Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "laying some pipe"
---
They have once already back in June.
---
Easy 
---
I'm in a way out of the way spot. Very little attacks too
---
Imagine... all the poeple
---
Seems like 40 might be the max then, as it's also 40 for me to move and has been since about 100 or so, I wasn't paying attention. I guess it's good to know it's not going up from there?
---
i don't think so, game load pretty quick and i have normal fps befero click to play.
---
Same, but I stopped in December, is the game better now? How about some cool builds?
---
Normal response and it happens across all platforms.  They‚Äôve never been able to restore items.  Only time was the person who lost everything and then they gave back an old backup.  Awesome for them the rest of us aren‚Äôt as important or game breaking.  Been happening since the beginning and I would bet it won‚Äôt change anytime soon if ever.  Just my opinion of course but I‚Äôve lost several items and always have gotten the same message, even pictures aren‚Äôt enough they just don‚Äôt care enough to go back now and try and add the necessary tags\identifiers to trace what we have or the tools to give them the ability to return them.  Sorry for your loss it‚Äôs horrible and unacceptable but just what it is. Remember it just works:p
---
An ***invigorating*** fat man? What does he do, give you a Swedish massage?
---
No, they said that wouldn't happen until next year.
---
If the game was more stable, I'd be totally down with paying for my own server, so long as it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. This game, however, is not stable. At least not as stable as ESO.
---
An honest question from a fairly low level player, how do you manage to totally fill a stash with bare necessities?
---
the explosive part is also subject to its own DR, its not a true 32% damage addition (with demo 5), its a second hit at 32% of the damage the shot does, and that 32% will also be impacted by the enemies DR, so its actually dependant upon what you are hitting.   Its a second hit at 32%dmg, not an additional 32%dmg.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs a tough one. Should award your choice of weapon and armor plans.
---
Exactly what i remember too.
---
Also got the game in hopes of sooner or later playing it without trolls and such.
---
Between the rumors of paid private servers and the Wastelanders delay, the inside the vault article just wiped my hype.
---
Plainly, after playing almost from release, now i've lost all interest in the game. Not even playing for the easy daily atoms now.
---
Almost? They said it wasn't coming until 2020 unless they've changed that.
---
Yes, its worth it. 
---
Floopy, where are you?!?!?! we NEED  your post.
---
Personally a lot of my weight is going to costumes. I don‚Äôt like to keep the same look for my character, so I swap it out pretty regularly. But each item of clothing ways 1/10 of a pound.
---
Yes but very poorly. 
---
Before the grass would not get removed upon placing foundation or anything for that matter now it doesn't. 
---
Bulldozed. More like lawn mower feature lol
---
I got mine from a nice,  generous person from this sub. (I traded some stuff,  but no where near what this plan is worth.  Thanks again! )
---
That is the feature
---
True, but for whatever reason explosive legendaries never seem to work for me as I tend to sneak up on enemies to make sure I'm well in range and can unload some concentradted fire and I generally end up damaging myself with explosives.
---
The thought process here just shows that you're an antisocial ass. Thanks for making the game less fun for everyone else.
---
Strangler
---
Damn right
---
Besides all the advertisements. Would you rather your gameplay interrupted to watch an ad? Lol
---
You don't have a youtube account? 
---
I need the video and you need a youtube account
---
If you want to build a PA suit, you have to farm.
---
I try to have 10 of each bulk, and round down none bulk to 200. Exceptions to this are Ballistic Fiber Plastic and Lead. The rest is outfits. No aid, No weapons, and some sets of armor I swap for certain situations, which forces me to use Ultra Light.
---
Nope I don't store any items
---
Usually what I do (due to the absolutely ridiculously broken idea that killing the workshop owner doesn't immediately claim the workshop, which is how these griefer asshats are able to repeatedly kill the poor lower level trying to scrape together mats) is come back, completely ignore trying to fight, and spend the time they are shooting at me deleting everything from the workshop. Sure, you can have the spot, but all those turrets, all that machinery? Build it your damn self.

yeah, secthegreat

Thank you for this insight!

Nothing wrong with emoji use as long as it is appropriate and not excessive. I didn't see your unedited comment
---
It signifies prestige. When I see other players with those peasant metal letters on their vending machines I feel better about myself.
---
No I would not. But i would also like a game to be stable before asked to pay more.
---
The days of camp destruction was amazing. Orbital strikes were a must lool
---
It'd work better if there was some form of scarcity. If weapons and gear was permanently destroyed after being repaired one too many times. If the environment was hostile and if limb damage didn't magically disappear.
---
Fo76 is fun, but its more looter shooter than survival simulator.

Laser pointer on eye glasses can get people into heaps of trouble. Maybe break a glowstick and toss it.

A player died in scorched earth, came back and was looking for the paper bag. I shot at the bag and they found it straight away.

The only purpose of that challenge is to track how many hours you‚Äôve played. It isn‚Äôt actually something you are supposed to grind for lol

Gotcha, I hadn‚Äôt used them before I don‚Äôt think, it just fit with the post because it was supposed to sound sort of sarcastic and bratty.

Thank you to everyone who provided insight!

Can i kill and stuff mama murphy next time i get instigating reduced weight walking cane and put in my camp
---
Actually, when we buy from mama, the scrips can be transferred over to the legendary vendor machine. Chicken n egg thingie
---
You aren‚Äôt be asked to pay more for adventure mode. You only pay more if you are asking them to provide you with a provide server... which cost money.
---
That seems like a lot of GPU for just running the video loop on the title screen.  
---
Maybe go into the game directory and run the .exe directly using the right click and "run on this gpu" option?  
---
Just trying to rule stuff out.
---
Don't use blueprints .)
---
Yes I know.  I wasn‚Äôt being mean.  I just loved it because I can relate.  The way you worded it was perfect.  Not sure how to explain it, It just was a comment made by someone who is really enjoying the game and I always think that is great.
---
And the lack of humility from BGS to ask that in the current state is mind boggling. Downvoting me isnt going to change my mind, my dude or the reality.
---
Ah ok, my bad. I misunderstood what you meant and thought it was kind of a sly dig at me.
