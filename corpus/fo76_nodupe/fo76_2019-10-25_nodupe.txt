Hats off to the guy who did it. Honestly I‚Äôm so happy this happened. They full out deserve it and now I know for sure that Bethesda knows just how pissed we all are with them.

If you subscribe and do dailies you can buy it lol

The best [Fallout First](https://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) ad ever
---
Im just fucking with u üòÇ
---

---
Its all good bro
---
M8 most of you have been shitting on this game since it was announced, especially on the main fallout subreddit, don‚Äôt act like that wasn‚Äôt always the case.
---
bro üòéüí™
---
16 times the detail
---
How would you know. Do you know me I don't think so.
---
Stop projecting kiddo. I wasn't asking about you specifically. 
---
Let me rephrase the question, if the subscription isn't content then what is Bethesda charging $100 a year for?
---
Lol
---
HAHAHAHA! It keeps happening! Why are you still buying this shit? You're like a battered housewife.
---
i raged for a bit ...then i got curious........i wanna see it for myself lol. just a month if its bad then cancel :-p  plus the game is on sale on the store sooooooo why not .
---
i actually didnt hate the beta just felt paying 60 for it then was not worth it. glad i waited.. even if this brings up more issues LOL
---
I mean, what can you expect from ZeniMax other than greed?  
---
Donald Trump's younger goddamn brother is on the board of directors.  
---
But agreed; Todd Howard and Pete Hines are idea men; and much like engineers, they slap something on paper to try and sell in concept. They try and sell it to us, and they try to sell it to the people a step up above them. (This isn't me defending them, they still lie out their ass like they ate taco bell)  
---
They may very well have willingly sold out rather than caved to the demands of the people above them, of course, but that's a different kettle of fish, and when ES6 comes out, it's gonna be regarded with GREAT skepticism.  
---
But yes. Zenimax is the executive meddler in this.   
---
If you dig a little into the good ol' Horse Armor debacle, you'll find Zenimax is right at the root. (Along with the shady BS tactics of the Microsoft Marketplace, of course.)
---
It definitely is really over priced I can see them reducing the atoms in it or removing some of the features in it. Because at the moment it's pay to win
---
Yeah this is basically how to kill trust/relationship with the community 101 right here.  Which is dumbfounding when they've had an uphill battle to restore trust with people.
---
I mean, it's still true. The stupid pass thing doesn't get you any extra content.
---
Said the exact same thing about Games Workshop.
---
Someone else made a post which had datamined info.  It may or may not be 100% accurate as they mentioned, but the rewards will be xp based with the glowing skeleton taking 14k xp.
---
Like someone already said, yes. Also according to their site you can keep using it, even if you don't renew your sub.
---
lol that‚Äôs fun üòÇ
---
Free canvas bags
---
You do realize Microsoft was the one that put the price on it right? Bethesda just gave in to the suggested price.
---
I would really appreciate it if you realized that at NO point in time this freaking game has ever deserved your time or money. I mean it, this game is literally one of THE biggest screw-ups in gaming, and definitely the very biggest screw-up in AAA gaming. And it's also the cause for the fastest Hero to Zero drop a gaming company has ever experienced. Refrigerators are a pretty recent blunder, the game's had a shitton of them before that.
---
And the most important part is that it launched in this state. It didn't become any better since launch, it only became worse and the P2W mechanics got introduced. Remember, a YEAR has passed already. And if any of you guys still believes Bethesda will turn things around with FO76 in the future... You just gotta wake up friends. For your own good.
---
You don't have to apologize for anything, just realize that there are no "conspiracy theories" in the AAA gaming anymore, not with the AAA publishers at least, those are just facts or predictions based on simple logic. You can analyze the trends and the events of the recent years yourself to realize that what people have been saying and you thought it to be conspiracy theories are actually perfectly logical conclusions and predictions anyone could come to eventually on their own. Ever since the Battlefront II "pride and accomplishment" debacle, I've been watching the AAA industry from the sidelines and analyzing, analyzing, analyzing. That's pretty much 2.5 years of analyzing at this point. And I gotta tell you, at no point in time did Fallout 76 seem like a good deal to me. It's an extremely fun game, one of the most entertaining games in history I believe. But not because it's good or fun to play. Instead, it's because the damn thing just keeps spiraling down into the depths of hell. It's funny for me because I haven't spent a single penny on it, I'm just watching the dumpster fire and having fun, but for all of you here on this sub, well... I can only hope we all stand united against the future releases like FO76 and Anthem, and by being smart consumers and voting with our wallets and voicing our concern on social media, we can actually make a difference.
---
Don't apologize, you don't owe anyone anything here! However, if you care about gaming industry in general or AAA gaming in particular, or even just some specific genre of gaming, in future, just research. Research thoroughly and give it considerable time before you decide on your purchase. And only if you're 100% sure it would make sense to give a company your money, buy it. That would probably be the single best thing anyone of us could ever do to fight this bullshit.
---
Oh, and yeah, stop playing FO76! That's also important ;)
---
You know what, I'll take the bite. You can strip any concept to bare bones and make it sound somewhat similar to the original statement as a way to deconstruct it. This does not make your interpretation any less true than others', and especially with an ambiguous quote such as this, different conclusions can be drawn  
---
I'm not that familiar with the quote so I'll give a couple of possible interpretations
---
1- You don't become a hero by just being a good person. By definition, a hero must have exemplary qualities that puts him in a position to accomplish what a normal person cannot. Power, courage and mental capabilities are just a few of these qualities.
---
Villains are also on the same boat. They are usually very smart or hold great power or influence that they can intervene with the hero's goal.
---
So your average person cannot be a hero nor a villain, but a hero possesses the ability to become a villain if they desire. It's difficult to be responsible with your influence for longer periods of time, so you either die as a hero, or time will make you use your power to become a villain. 
---
This can be a warning for heroes or those who rely on them. With great power comes great responsibility and whatnot.
---
2- You live protecting your ideals, or you live long enough to be the one destroying them. This is a more sinister interpretation but it can be true as well. A hero in general always holds certain values he and the public views as true. But as time passes and the hero begins to think that those values are false, he effectively becomes the villain from the public's perspective if he acted on it. 
---
Then there is your interpretation, which is not particularly wrong but it's just that, an interpretation. Arguing that the quote is not deep by arguing against your interpretation of it doesn't make you smart.
---
Personally, no, generally, probably, people love to bitch
---
Hahahaha....
---
Sorry for your loss :(. Here's hoping they refund it.
---
It's painfully obvious, man.
---
I have two accounts. One I play with, one I stash shit to. Since most of the shit is stashed to mule account, it was my primary trading one for a long period.
---
I have an extensively long friendlist on main account, and mostly traders on the other.
---
The first day of patch 14 I seen a lot of the people on private worlds, majority of the friendlist visiting private worlds, and minority simply online. On the mule account, the one that had only close friends and traders, literally 100% of the friendlist was listed as playing their own private server.
---
Don't get me wrong, I was super hyped for 24-people private servers and extremely let-down with Fallout 1st, but by looking at both my friendlists, I'm in the minority.
---
So glad I never wasted money on this shit game. Fuck Bethesda.
---
Unsatisfied. Add single player, add npcs. Add factions. Add group building mechanics.
---
Yea people can totally support shitty business practices, but people can also choose not to. People who buy the 1st pass guarantee that greedy stuff like this will appear in future games. What games are made is determined by what makes money, so if everyone spends their money on overpriced, underwhelming tat then that's all we're gonna get. The quality of games are going downhill because of this so I'm trying to be a part of the solution by voting with my wallet
---
If they made private servers decent.
---
[removed]
---
It started 9 months ago with Unstoppable costumes giving 10 HP, tbh.
---
[deleted]
---
Everything or just the last thing‚Äôs price will turn into 10 caps? This sounds confusing
---
At this point I‚Äôd pay a one time fee if it got me the scrap box and the tent. I believe they‚Äôll add both to the atom shop in the next couple months though.
---
Here‚Äôs the thing and I‚Äôm not telling you what to do or anything. You don‚Äôt have to buy anything from the atom shop or the subscription, it‚Äôs that simple. Also what makes you think a ‚Äúprivate world‚Äù in a online game is a day one basic thing?
---
This sub isn't healthy for anyone. Just people with shit for brains and shit talkers who think the are the authority on everything.
---
Jesus christ.. i don't support Bethesda's decision with Fallout 1st but death threats are never okay!
---
I'm sorry yer going through this shit bro. Hope yer holding up okay :/
---
Yea, spot on. I do love the community and the game has its issues but it's a good game despite BGS. But this sub bullshit is just that bullshit. But if you dare speak against it, they come running.
---
I bought at Beta, played off and on and grinded till just recently for everything I got. All and all, I‚Äôve gotten more hours out of this game than any other. I‚Äôm not quitting, but I sure as hell won‚Äôt spend another red cent to play.
---
DO IT TO ME DO IT TO ME!
---
The level displayed on the loading screen has been bugged since the first alt character was created.
---
This is something else: this is the game pretending to be loaded up and playable, yet forgetting to apply your character over the "thing" you're moving through map.
---
You know, I thought something was up last night when I went to TNT Dome 3 and 7 and the plans that I usually farm were gone. I hadn't been there since last Wednesday, they always respawn by then... unless someone grabs them.
---
in the future people will no longer refer to something that fails miserably as a 'dumpster fire'. this phrase will be replaced with 'Fallout 76'ed'.
---
Then I suppose the vast majority of the fanbase, even some of the most dire and loyal fans, are trolling and overreacting? I wonder what more it'd take from Bethesda to warrant these "overreactions" in your opinion. But then again this is the sort of careless and dismissive attitude that allows companies like them to keep making "questionable business decisions" and normalizing them because it could be much worse am I right? And rest assured that the internet won't forget any of this, they'll stop talking about it but will likely never forget, not when Bethesda is so keen to remind us all so frequently. I mean, people never even forgot about horse armor after all.
---
If they sent it through text, file with the FBI.
---
They sought you out across platforms to send death threats. 
---
That is a federal offence and the law isnt playing with those kinds of people anymore.
---
Fans have every right to complain about a dissatisfying service, pretending otherwise is forgetting the relationship a business has with its customers.
---
Make Fallout Great Again
---
Password can only be used once a month.
---
i use 1 or 2 poison resist armor pieces vs the queen and in vault 94 and find it mitigates a fuckton of damage that otherwise kills other players without poison resist.  
---
That said it's only situationally useful and a lot of the time you'd be better off using some other armor.
---
You left out the atom challenges that won't complete. Like finding locations. I have been to abandoned Bog Town A hundred times taken the workshop there and it still will not register as found. My map shows it as found but no atoms. And the kill the Queen challenge. Can't count how many times I helped bring her down but still no credit. Games fixed. That's all there is to it.
---
Same man, I uninstalled and deleted the launcher, I will never buy from Bethesda as long as they continually fuck over loyal customers like this.
---
I didn‚Äôt say you were telling me what to do. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs fucking horseshit for a company to hide day one content behind a paywall for a game that‚Äôs so terribly rated and has a bad history. Especially when the original price was $60.
---
No, I don‚Äôt need to buy the subscription. Thanks for telling me, it‚Äôs not at all the point. I already paid for shit. I shouldn‚Äôt need to pay for more shit, especially not shit I was promised and expected to have after paying my $60.
---
And most other games that have private sessions (NOTE: these aren‚Äôt personal private servers, they‚Äôre PRIVATE SESSIONS) for free. It‚Äôs certainly not worth anywhere near $12.99 a month. PERIOD.
---
Don't let some stupid fucks get to you. I don't support Fallout 1st at all, but that's not your fault, it's Bethesda's.
---
A couple months or so after the costumes I decided that I was wrong since they hadn't done anything past that. Of course I just had to be correct.
---
No its funny
---
Im still mad they added a Battle Royale to a broken game
---
**Repent optimist**
---
Ima smoke one in your honour ‚úåÔ∏èüí®
---
Based on the spelling, I'd would have said Pete.
---
I got a lot of flack on twitter and Reddit when I was saying that it was only going to get worse.  When people defend bad decisions, it only reinforces these gaming companies to "hold my beer". This is not the end, its only the beginning. There will be pay to win items coming to the Atomic shop such as legendary Weapons, Armor and other fan requested items and services. They don't care about this backlash. They will continue to implement this type of content until the cash cow runs out and this game dies its proper death.
---
They still haven't fixed bug issues we brought to them months ago.
---
I 100% guarantee you that if they did it that way everyone would still find things to nitpick and hate on
---
Damage control right here, boys.
---
You can set PS4 to go to an hour back
---
This exactly...
---
Law don't fuck around
---
I don't mind it. I treat this subscription thing as a bundle pack I can choose to pay for each month with added perks for that month.
---
Greedy ass Bethesda, not surprised.
---
If it wasn‚Äôt for shitty people in game maybe people wouldn‚Äôt have requested it... go figure...
---
I don't play on Xbox but after the recent posts I've seen with the subscription and the game becoming more buggy, I'm not surprised that people would stop play on all servers
---
So your solution is for all of Bethesda‚Äôs game designers to just quit and that‚Äôll teach the company not to do that?
---
Fuck that, if I went through all the schooling and shit and managed to get a job at Bethesda, who besides 76 has had a decent track record at producing great games, there‚Äôs no way in hell im going to walk away over a subscription pass. These people don‚Äôt have infinite money either where they can just quit their jobs and be fine. God Todd himself will walk out and do it at that point. Like if the company wants it, it‚Äôs going to happen. What the fans can do is express their opinions and, it‚Äôs happened before, Hope things change.
---
&gt;This game isn't P2W because the definition of P2W means nothing
---
Jesus fucking Christ.
---
So... what you are saying is that they will bring this "feature" back on the next patch?
---
Strangler is working fine on ps4
---
You've literally made have a dozen posts yesterday asking people to buy this sub. Threats (if true) are not justified but people's displeasure in you very much is.
---
Crouch while doing this or someone like me will come kill you and take any junk you have. Fast travel if someone contests or just stash you junk and fight back. Dying doesn't really matter.
---
It's a very loud minority, but still the minority.
---
JUNK JET
---
Yeah the slipper slope is something real when it comes to soulless corporations.
---
Their entire purpose is to make money, give them an inch and they‚Äôll take a mile.
---
After playing in a private server yesterday, I think free junk space should be for everyone. The ability to store unlimited steel, lead, cloth and acid really does have a competitive advantage.
---
I also think the tent should be useable in private worlds only, if it isn‚Äôt already.
---
He is right üòÇ
---
Scarp takes up most of the space in the stash box so it is definitely pay to win
---
1 poison resistance piece can be handy, I sometimes swap one in. I thought it helps when a scorch beast farts on you, but I could be wrong
---
I didn‚Äôt say the game couldn‚Äôt be fun I said it doesn‚Äôt have enough content or updates to justify the amount of monetization it has.
---
+karma
---
I want you to know that I appreciate your positivity, as well as the parent comment to my previous one (belonging to /u/itsmillerctime)
---
I realized. Hey, why let a small thing ruijg my hard earned night of fun?  I just started a rare 3day weekend.  I've sunk a bunch of time in this game in the past 13 months.
---
Losing my junk? 
---
That's like "whatever" in comparison to anything else in my life that's happened in the past year.
---
You two have an awesome life, you rock!
---
Yea, I'd be ok. One time, man.
---
My server is full and plenty of vendors... also seeing plenty of scrap boxes...
---
It's fucking so disappointing. It was my first mmofps so I didn't know any better. I know that the division and destiny have had their share of problems but those games are fucking butter smooth. 500 hours in div 1 &amp; 2 over the last 4 months and I think I had maybe 1 or 2 drop outs? Div 2 has weekly state of the game live interviews! Why Bethesda? Why fallout? Why?
---
I agree.It sounds more like they realized there wasn't enough to go with.I think there just postponing it and adding to it rather than simply polishing it off.
---
Damn dark. I‚Äôm sorry to hear.
---
One time fee for permanent mini camp, scrapbox, and "private" server access? Yeah, that would be way better even if it was straight up cash instead of Atoms.
---
There are all kinds of reasons people are for or against this idea, personally my problem with it is Bethesda as the developer made a promise to their players (never sell in-game advantages) and then flipped on it. This is unacceptable, frankly I don't think that kind of behavior should even be legal.
---
Might seem like an overreaction, but should businesses really be permitted to blatently lie to customers without repercussions?
---
You can lierally tell that it's a bot account. 4 year old account with 19 karma and two posts, both on Fallout 7t subreddit. The other post is asking what consumable items are in demand, 6 days ago. Probably Bethesda trying to gather info on what to sell next. Maybe they'd thought they could post that as proof saying that people actually wanted it.
---
I didn't think of it that way until now.... dam
---
Good about this suggestion: I completely don't dig any of the ATX stuff added in the subscription, yet I would pay for maintenance of multiple 24 people servers if they would let me.
---
Good one
---
&gt;This was form the Forbes magazine article...
---
You say that as if that site has any actual value anymore. 
---
Its all paid per click 'micro blog' .. They will write anything that gets people to click on them.
---
The story of gta and rdr are worth $60 but gta Online is what I meant and that game has intentionally unbalanced PvP (hydras, oppressors have no counter and ceo work forces you to use slow defenseless vans) to make grinding artificially tedious and try to force ppl to buy money. That game you can legit pay to win and due to the extreme lack of balance often time you can‚Äôt even grind for it bc it‚Äôs so easy for people to grief you
---
Goo piles disappearing and the machine gun sound fix were also pretty great. Two big QoL chances there, at least for me.
---
I know I wasn‚Äôt telling you what to do, I was giving my ‚Äútwo cents‚Äù as they say. But listen man I don‚Äôt feel like arguing, you have your opinion I have my and I doubt either of us are going to change each others minds. Good luck with life and don‚Äôt let a video game ruin your happiness. Cheers
---
im one of the guys that lost all of his scrap. this article says that its a visual bug and you can still craft from it. i tried to mod my powerarmor with fluxes i lost being the only missing ingredient. didnt work.
---
Might have been people waiting for the download to finish like me
---
Not this month, wait till next month. In exchange of ranger armor I saw less players, especially newer players. Its more fun to be around newer players than older ones
---
So...the PSA shouldn‚Äôt be ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use other people‚Äôs scrap boxes‚Äù it should be ‚Äúdon‚Äôt play this game‚Äù.
---
I doubt they'd go that low but i'd get it.
---
I got a *** at Line in the Sand.
---
They‚Äôre both very different games with a different gameplay experiences, I personally don‚Äôt know which one I have more fun playing , because they‚Äôre both appealing in different ways.
---
Bye Felicia.
---
Don‚Äôt get offended over what people say on the internet if you do sorry you shouldn‚Äôt be on the internet at all.
---
Sure, it is easier, but the problem can be avoided without it.
---
&gt; Sets up an overpriced subscription service for their most controversial game
---
&gt; The meager features (that should be part of the base game) don't even work 
---
this is the most Bethesda thing i have ever heard.
---
I feel you. I bought the game on sale and have spent $20 on atom bundles. I play pretty casually and have grown accustomed to microtransactions in games, so I never gave this much thought until the last update. I'm bummed that such basic features have been locked behind a paywall. I'll probably still log in and play, but I'm not spending anymore money on this game.
---
Servers are almost always a paid service dunno why this a shock to everyone
---
Specially when it comes to death threats online
---
Never bought it, after this? Never will.... Never trusting Bethesda either. You can hold me to that one.
---
Your two cents is supporting a subscription that‚Äôs literally a scam. Unfortunately too many people spread their cheeks for large businesses who are clearly ripping people off then get chippy at others who are actually willing to hold their feet to the fire. Hopefully you don‚Äôt buy that garbage which will probably disappear in a few weeks.
---
Every game is over apparently
---
Bethesda starts charging us for healthcare
---
&gt;access to legendary monthly challenges that reward with extra atoms, and some form of loot.
---
??? isn't that the same thing as pay to win? you have the chance to get a weapon that other people couldn't get because you PAID something. Some weekly survival reward were trash, but there were some good weapons. For example the Unstoppable Monster.
---
Because it was for Oblivion, not Skyrim. Their shitty ways go WAY back.
---
This game taught me A lesson. After 25 years of PC gaming Bethesda taught me to never pre-order any game. Wait till it's been out for A couple of months and check the social sites for comments on how bad it may be. I am A fallout fan. Played the crap out of them all. But this one is not properly done. Too many broken patches. I cannot remember a single patch that didn't break something. Hoping wastelanders will actually fix this game. We will see. Meanwhile I noticed I have 9 games I have not even played yet. So I got plenty to keep me busy.
---
Am I missing a jesting remark here? Socialism can save video games when capitalism is the very reason a luxury entertainment product can exist?
---
I am all against binding in unbridled greed, but this is just nonsense. If you really want to undercut the 'capitalist' pigs, just by lesser known Indie games.
---
Ooooh, the irony of this response.
---
 Right, like I acknowledged.
---
If they start seeing less money coming in, they may just charge for the Wastelanders DLC. I can definitely see that happening at this rate.
---
Same, but only I have just over 5x the time you put in, new game time for sure...
---
You can't put owning a console and that companys choices for online services on fo76, complain to sony or microsoft. As for the other part free dlc is a godsend anymore.
---
Bethesda is a subsidiary of ZeniMax. So is ZeniMax Online Studio. 
---
The exact same person(s) make decisions, ultimately, that affect either Fallout 76 or Elder Scrolls Online.
---
I'm not worried at all... because I'm totally done with Bethesda. I was feeling that way months ago, so this is just another nail in the coffin.
---
Your wrong tho. But your opinion is your opinion. Fo76 has more content for players like you then 4. But for some reason fallout crowd is real picky.
---
1 and 2 vs anything else. 3 vs NV. 4 vs having your toe stubed on a glass table.
---
They will continue on for a long time with this game now that all of fallout subredit showed up to say they are commies and not to buy something thay didnt affect them at all.
---
Man the number of people who jumped in to buy the subscription was huge. Bethesda just made heaps of money thx to all the attention.
---
EA and Activision are still easily much worse in my eyes
---
Bethesda didn't think about this game much at all. There's more brainstorming in this subreddit then the entire team over there
---
Never said it wasn't.  If there was nothing to gain from a subscription no one would buy it.
---
Reminds me of that one south park scene *"we're sorry"*
---
I‚Äôm also seeing a ton of friends with (private) meaning they bought the subscription as well!
---
Get to level 50 first bud.
---
Yeah, scrap you keep saving up and not using. My stash always has an excess of junk that's not used much. There's no combat advantage with being able to store unlimited junk. People die in pvp with seconds, pve encounters with more than 1 person are still pretty quick. You gain no real advantage grinding legendaries and/or grinding levels etc. There still is a script limit and cap limit for vendors. You still can farm junk at the same rate. So, no, not really.
---
Ah shit.
---
I am
---
So you openly admit that it is pay to win? Good. This realization was important. Most people are still in denial.
---
Aye, that be the joke.
---
Epic step 2 find someone that‚Äôs actually quitting on the sub!
---
ahh, didnst see the date when I read that. good to know
---
I haven't purchased it and don't see what the big deal is.  It doesn't impact my ability to enjoy the game as I did before it was released. The only advantage I would have is freeing up \~50 or so lbs of storage as as keep a modest junk stockpile owing to the fact that I simply don't use very much of it - not worth the price for me personally.
---
I also don't really feel any different at all about Bethesda.  They are a for profit company trying to make a buck and if people want to buy this service more power to them.  Every video game ever made is a "shameless cash grab".  Companies that are glorified like CD project red are not somehow mysteriously more altruistic than EA or Zenimax, rather all game developers are out there trying to convince players to spend money in some way, shape or form.
---
I had the opportunity to join a buddy's private server and it seemed solid.  We ran the vault raid with no lag at all.  So as far as I can see it works great but then again maybe others are having problems.  This game has plenty of bugs so expecting the private servers to be bug free is a stretch.
---
Nope I'm blaming Bethesda for making a strictly online game and then asking players to buy a subscription that cost more than than Xbox live
---
I'm pretty sure there are still a fair amount of Fallout 2nd's (me including) that's going to still play without subscription. There might have been a population of Fallout 2nd's that awoke from slumber just to see what the ruckus is about.
---
Destiny 2 is fucking amazing, what are you talking about?
---
There is not a single game with private server la that are not around that price lol.... That's the only defense they need, don't complain about them following suit with every other game out there that offers private servers.
---
What you're referring to, is called 'puffery'. And unless it's handled properly, it can be damaging to your brand. Usually people write off puffery as BS. But Bethesda just writes checks their ass refuses to cash.
---
Does that retroactively nullify fraudulent surveys?
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
Leader of the pack is a terrific source for 3 quick legendaries.  A few runs and she will have plenty to choose from and experiment with.  And if you team up, you‚Äôll get 6 at her level.  Fun!
---
:) such a wholesome post
---
You get what you pay for.
---
Thanks.
---
Lol no players are quiting. The people who are quitting are the r/fallout players who never owned the game but sub to some youtube cuck.
---
Here‚Äôs another reason horse armor was shady that u/ChipotleBanana didn‚Äôt mention:
---
Horse Armor was *in the Oblivion game code* from the day you bought it, brought it home and played it. Bethesda charged $2.50 for players to unlock something they had *already paid for*.
---
Sl√°n leat
---
Pay more money than MC, for smaller servers, that aren't yours, that you can't host, that aren't persistent, that can't be played on by your friends if you're not there, that will change every time you log in.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Great pitch lads.
---
Hope you don't mind, added to my bug roundup as a reference as I've seen enough posts in the last 24 hours to call it another bug..

[Unofficial but Comprehensive Bug Roundup | Patch 14.0 | 10/23/2019 - The "Bombs" Dropped &amp; Private Servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm9q59/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/)  
---
Seems to crop up post patch every so often...
---
‚Äúpay to win scrap box‚Äù
---
lmao
---
Other than the ''cosmetics only'' phrase, nothing of what he said is false. Optional subscription that doesn't harm people who don't sub is not content, it's also not DLC.
---
While the scrap/repair kits, scavenger bot, fridge, etc were not ''cosmetic only'' they are not P2W either, all the in-game options are superior. The Scrapbox is a QoL addition locked behind a sub but it's neither content, DLC or P2W. The Survival Tent is irrelevant if fast travel is enabled. Afaik Wastelanders or other actual DLC content won't be locked behind the sub.
---
While they did broke the ''cosmetics only'' promise, all the other non-cosmetic things they have released are irrelevant at endgame, so if people are so upset about unlimited junk storage, fridges or scrap kits then they either are new players or they don't play the game at all.
---
This is really weirding me out... Even if you're a huge fo76 fan I'm not sure how you can watch the game's existence till now and be mystified that the average gamer isn't impressed with Bethesda.
---
They don't hear much resistance to their POV, because people know that trying to change their minds is pointless (out of all the ragespam, how many have encouraged civil conversation?). Then, it becomes an echo-chamber, which convinces them that everyone feels the same way.
---
Don't get me wrong, Bethesda has made plenty of missteps, but the sheer foaming-at-the-mouth hatred is just ridiculous. People are acting like this is worse than ever, but a year ago people were calling for Todd Howard to be drawn and quartered over getting a cheap bag with their $200 helmet. This too shall pass.
---
But you most likely didnt get your gold membership just for fallout, so that really shouldn't be added to the cost of the game, just like the fact you have to pay for internet should not be added to the cost of the game like some people do, it's all optional and you don't have to buy it.
---
Yep it is nice to see old friends come back. But don't worry the haters will come in and stomp shit all over your joy I am sure.
---
I have to disagree seeing as how much scap you can have at once means you can hoard it and either sell it to others or to vendors. Also anything that adds something to the game that's not cosmetic is a unfair advange also know as pay to win
---
Can't argue as I was apposed to it unless it was in game for everyone and the Skins were the only variation...  
---
But a nerf is a nerf
---
Not the intent, but if it helps breaks the cycle of addiction, awesome!
---
Absolutely!
---
I was looking for craftable options not stuff like canned food u find somewhere
---
I am afraid Wastelanders might not be free for all. And Dogmeat and other nice things being released at very high prices, since subscribers now have More atoms and atoms themselves have lost a bit of value.
---
You on pc? I need heaps of booze! Im thinking of cutting back on water.
---
You say that like people weren't going to play Outer Worlds anyways. Lol. I was always going to but I'll likely return to 76 after a week or two.
---
Riot gear has no extra cost and it is yours to keep even if you unsub.  Same with emotes and icons, etc.
---
dear todd please go back in time
---
bethesda is a one hit wonder and 2019 is the year people realize...?
---
The world will shift to containers. Micro services. Thats the right approach in DEV/OPS. But they can still do something to retain the world state as it is when you rejoin. But, gracefully handle the respawns
---
It's no different than Maxson's Battlecoat was.  If you want the coat so badly, sub for a month and cancel it.
---
Sounds good
---
The first time!? You must have the patience of a saint.
---
Exactly what I‚Äôm getting at. This entry in the series will fade as time goes on. However it was enough of a success to keep them rolling into their next title release.
---
Honestly from here they are just like EA. The goal is to pump out title after title in the pursuit of making money. Then add whatever scummy transactions into the mix to squeeze every dollar out of their consumers. 
---
I‚Äôm not mad at the market tactic, that‚Äôs the magic of capitalism. I‚ÄôM JUST DISAPPOINTED BETHESDA TOOK THIS APPROACH WHEN THEY HAVE THE CAPABILITIES TO DO SO MUCH MORE!
---
Remember, the Internet enables people to hid behind anonymity.  Anyone who threatened you face-to-face would go to jail.   
---
Don‚Äôt give the little cowards the satisfaction of dictating whether you engage with the Fallout 76 Reddit community.
---
Yes, we have to pay both.
---
I know what you mean. I've enjoyed playing this game and it makes me sad to see it going downhill.
---
Is it because its not on the store I know itll be mine but till its added to the store gotta wait and see
---
No, it is QOL like many MMOs charge for.  I an still play and win just fine, I will just have to keep managing my stash if I choose to not subscribe.
---
Do you keep it behind security walls? I moved to the forest to mitigate tough enemies but I'm still concerned some jerk will pull enemies to it to purposely kill it.
---
remember the beta?
---
stop making fun of cynics and maybe you'll stop feeling foolish
---
I spent $60 on the game when I pre-ordered it, played son beta, I‚Äôve never spent any money on the atom shop nor will I and I will not be purchasing the subscription either. I‚Äôve learned a lot in my 31 years on this earth.
---
Any game which sells in-game advantages (fallout 76 obviously does) is "p2w" so... You're wrong? 
---
Now whether you think p2w matters in a game like 76 is absolutely an opinion you can have.
---
Sad to say.. logged in tonight and the servers were all empty.. all the players I'd met on my travels were on private servers. The game is now as dead as the worlds. I found 4 other people on one world which was the highest. Logged into one and there was only one other person. 
---
Sucks.
---
They already nuked themselves yesterday, on the -58th anniversary of the bombs dropping in the Fallout universe. lol
---
Game is just boring after 2200 hrs, can care less how people waste their money, it just gives more green lights for BGS to paywall more and more, kinda like feeding stray animals...you want to be nice and give them some food, but you know they won't leave or stop until you stop giving it to them....Bethesda is the stray animal.
---
I think it‚Äôs time for Bethesda to sell the fallout franchise. There clearly have no care for the lore, even the lore that they make. Almost everything from fallout 76 shouldn‚Äôt be considered canon.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:

Give me your shit!
---
The story is subpar, a lot of the side quests are pretty great though. Hardly ruins an entire game, definitely not the series. Especially when Far Harbor came around with a significantly better story.
---
New Vegas had a shitty story too, the only thing people even praise about it is that you can do different things to get a different powerpoint presentation at the end. Otherwise you get hardcore railroaded down a path, everyone assumes you give a shit about Benny, why bother making the first section about tracking him when no shit the well dressed guy in a game called New Vegas is going to be in New Vegas, by all logic the legion would be fucking decimated in the wasteland with melee weapons and spears against people with guns, artillery, radios and explosives.
---
Story branches in shallow ways and your impact across the game isn't felt at any point despite making changes you'd think would be major. Side quests 90% of the time are resolved by walking short distances and talking to people (see the shitty powder ganger side quest for an example)
---
I genuinely don't get what the hell people are seeing in New Vegas when they mention the story. It's a half assed revenge plot that has been done to death since the 70's
---
Why? Do you play the game? It‚Äôs super stable now. I had a ton of issues 11
---
Months ago but no problems now. It‚Äôs gotten a lot better.
---
In case anyone hasn‚Äôt uninstalled the game still:  FYI, while bobble heads and magazines *DO* weigh less, they *DO NOT* take up less camp budget....
---
How does it feel being Todd Howard?
---
Did that last night. Even uninstalled the launcher since that was the only game I used it for.
---
Ah so that how it is
---
 In that case I implore you to seek help for your addiction its never too late to heal.
---
yes you are right. it would have cost 1200 atoms but what the matter? this looks fantastic.
---
the fallout 1st costs 13$ which is around 1300 atoms. let me calculate what we get for paying 1$ more:
---
actually a lot !
---
Yes and the game isn‚Äôt free to play
---
Wait, Trump's younger brother is on the board? Holy shit, I didn't know that at all! And Pete and Todd have put out pretty good ideas and products. Debatable, fallout 4, but that's because it changed from fallout 3 and just, it wasn't to my expectations. And I can see them selling out, but I can also see them being pressured to be adding these things, but they are their ideas in the whole.
---
I noticed both of the bobbleheads and magazines were missing from the landlocked lighthouse.
---
Jesus people please do not pay for this.
---
Yup. There's a reason the internet imploded...
---
Also be sure to leave the remains somewhere in the Pacific Ocean, then use a FLAK gun emplacement against the remains, just to be sure
---
Uninstalled last night.
---
Both
---
If only we could still downvote old posts. We could take it from the top post to the bottom post... That would be an achievement.
---
Whos Todd Howard?
---
I think you missed the point.
---
*jerking off hand motion*
---
Good for you, I'll pray for your wallet.
---
Spend some time and google it, changing the specs of something post purchase and not announcing the change is not acceptable
---
I'm seeing the bigger picture now. I bought a couple of atom bundles in good faith, but I won't be spending anymore money on this game. It makes me sad.
---
in the last datamined atom shop items was also a version with green eyes.
---
i dont expect it that this will be the reward for the 2nd month of fallout 1st. so i guess this version comes into the atom shop.
---
1 month of PS Plus is 10$ the thing you NEED to play the game is less than one month subscription itself üò≠üíÄ
---
It still would have been a better game than this joke of a game
---
Ball-face??
---
So you want people to stop complaining? For having features that should have been free, and instead were made into micro transactions?
---
I gave up on this game (and Bethesda) months ago... This only makes me feel relief that I let them go and gave up all hope. I'm never buying a Bethesda game again.
---
I‚Äôm not talking about communism dude. I just want an immersive game that doesn‚Äôt make me feel like a cheater for using a quality of life feature that should be standard for everybody.
---
You shouldn't worry so much about the things that come out of people's mouth when they're getting fucked.
---
friend just gave me some caltrops today said they got it forma friend of theirs so they do indeed exist

---
Mmm I'm 90% sure everyone would still be giving it a bad rap.
---
Just bought.
---
Haha you found me out!
---
You're right; I really do want to love this game. I've given it every possible chance, but this is my breaking point.
---
I think we know all we need to know already.
---
I guess I'm on the "we'll see" line of thought for Wastelanders.
---
I.e. we'll see when it actually launches next year.  If I even still bother to pay attention to the game by then.
---
Two years from now it might be finished...
---
 For those that are upset, i understand why, but we all dont feel the same as you &amp; we dont also have to feel the same. 
---
If we have decided to purchase it, it's our choice.
---
Let's hope that the children who are stooping this low, just leave.  As i dont think any adult of right mind would do this. If your that unhappy, please find another game that would make you happier, same goes for anything in life eg. if your job really sux, try to find a better one. Living bitter all of the time is no way to live.
---
There was another moron yesterday calling everyone to grief anyone wearing the outfit &amp; guess what, he has never owned the game.
---
I have purchased the fallout 1st for the full year &amp; I enjoy it &amp; so will my son when we are playing together in our own little apocalyptic world.
---
I like the game &amp; always have, yes the bugs annoy the crap out of me sometimes, but I still play &amp; don't regret one minute of my over 1400 hours in this game.
---
The interface is sloppy, and often puts the wrong item in.  You have to be constantly vigilant.
---
Sorry about the owl.  Wish I had one to offer you.
---
Hopefully there will be something awesome to drop for halloween.
---
If you set it to collect scrap and not junk it could collect considerably more in the long run, which is what variables were changed.    
---
Between what it did collect and repair kits you could completely skip the inventory management and repair cycle.   
---
  
---
As for if I've actually played..     
---
I've got enough hours logged an intervention is warranted.
---
Sorry I doubted you, comrade.
---
I actually did. Prior to its release I had only purchased my system for Skyrim, and Fallout 4. Sad to say, but I literally bought an Xbox 1 for the sake of Bethesda....and starting with the creation club, I have become more, and more disappointed in Bethesda.
---
To control who is allowed to enter the server, and control the number of people on the server.
---
FYI, while they do weigh less, they still take up the same amount of camp budget.....  so that‚Äôs another line of BS
---
Probably because there's a money laundering scheme involved honestly. After all a trump sits on the zenimax board of directors
---
I don't imagine that's a very realistic occurrence
---
Who needs intelegence when you have charisma *fingerguns*
---
There is a difference between seeing level 1 on the loading screen and once you are in game...
---
And if I'm gonna pay someone to piss in my mouth, it'll  be a Russian hooker, not Todd Howard.
---
At least the hooker will charge a reasonable rate.
---
Yea. You can catch glimpses of fallout in 76, in the spirit of it. My kids will be in high school when fo5 comes out, this was my last chance to play a new fallout title. Kinda bumbed out
---
Nice. I play lots of games like that! Its so good cause when things get stale wait a bit and bam... Overhauls.
---
Unlike fo4 which will always be a smelly turd in the fallout pool.
---
Try swapping to a different paint and swapping back if you are willing to spend the time, let me know if it works and thanks for the comments!
---
Don't hope you'll just get burned again when they win you back with an empty apology
---
got excactly the same message. did all of the things except reinstalling. didnt work.
---
Nope... THough it's a lot cheaper than when I pre-ordered it. I won't make that mistake again. For a while, I held onto some hope they'd eventually improve things, but that went away months ago. I'm amazed that they managed to not only meet my hopes, but make things far worse!
---
That one kid from the chess club
---
I don't purchase any items with RL currency so no need to worry
---
Absurd.
---
We don't all hate it
---
Nothing wrong with people spending their money how they want.  Also some people are probably buying one month just for the armor.  
---
I am not buying it because it is not worth it, but I am not going to bash anyone else who does.
---
Running in SLI or stand alone?
---
HAH!   
---
They can't even get their unpopular cash grab to work properly!
---
16 TIMES THE DETAIL
---
Yeh i cant believe that myself thats why iam asking. I dont own the game i cant check for myself. Iam just keeping up with 76 in hopes it gets better one day.
---
Private world settings will only be cosmetic and will launch at the end of the month, just in time for people to renew. Mock my words. Things like spawn rates wont be impacted. They will make weather controllable and MAYBE allow you to raise the difficulty of a region. Instead of low levels in the forest region for example, you can spawn scorch beasts and high levels
---
No it dosnt work like that. You choose if you would like to go into adventure mode, a private server, or nuclear winter. If you choose private server you will be put into a brand new world. If someone who doesn't have a subscription tries to join you they can, however if you leave the server and no-one who is left has a sub in the private server, then they will get kicked.
---
Okay, thanks for commenting anyways
---
Yeah man. Everything with 76 could be either way, like they are actually a really dumb bunch of people or just super sleezy
---
I dont. Pete had no idea what was going on with 76 to begin with. He didnt know Gamestop was releasing it early. He didnt know about the stash limit. If you're going to be the pr guy then maybe know what's going on.
---
No, the private server was never advertised to be persistent, or that you could keep your workshops set up. People are fabricating reasons to be upset at this point.
---
What that depression diagnosed by a medical professionally?
---
Don't kink shame me bro
---
I‚Äôm blown away by all the people in this thread holding on for dear life to this trash fire game. I don‚Äôt get it.
---
I had that at white springs yesterday too however today loading in and out of sessions I was placed in the same server with despawned enemies. Lag I felt is worse than public just now. Might need to delete some friends as this is supposed to be a lag contributor.
---
MFGA!!
---
You need to update the INI's and make sure **NOT** to copy over the following line (remove it if you did copy it in.  
---
\[[Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net)\]
---
sEnvironment = Integration   
---
Also make sure you updated the renamed EXE's (I've forgotten myself)
---
It‚Äôs gotten better sure. And yes I play every day. Also get disconnected typically every day/ every other minimum.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone truly thinks it‚Äôs some next level deep shit, it‚Äôs just a cool quote from a badass movie. You‚Äôre reading into it too much I think, which is ironic since you‚Äôre the one saying it‚Äôs not deep yet are going in depth on why it‚Äôs not deep
---
Thanks!
---
Pay to win... what?  What's being "won"?
---
This.
---
Scuba Steve?
---
fuck
---
Public also
---
No, but it *is* a private but used world. 
---
So say one guy (let's call him Joe) started up his own server. This server is his very own freshly-instanced server. Eventually, he gets bored and leaves. It's completely possible for somebody else to start up their own private world and stumble upon Joe's former world. Though judging by how I went for these past couple of worlds, it's somewhat unlikely you'd actually end up joining a used world.
---
I totally agree! In fact, I only recently released a breathtaking new exploration called The Room of Doom. It consists of nothing but a single, empty room where you can let your imagination run wild! What terrors or delights might you face as your own mind becomes your worst enemy or your best friend?? And best of all, you can role-play as ANY character thanks to the removal of any and all restrictions on character creation‚Äîby skipping character creation altogether!
---
For the low-low price of $60 you can get in on the ground floor of this no-holds barred sandbox experience where the only limitation is your capacity to make your own fun. Or maybe you'd like to enhance your experience with what I'm calling 'virtual cosmetics'; $120 will net you the The Room of Doom: Doomified Edition, which comes with a virtual t-shirt and virtual aviator goggles for your character to wear‚Äîthey're virtual, so you'll never see them, but you can imagine what they'd look like, and isn't that so much cooler?!
---
Unlimited *scrap*
---
No, you're not. Your loot list is saved, so if you switch from public to private anything you already looted is gone until reset. Servers also have a maximum number of spawn IDs, so once that is reached the oldest IDs are killed off to make room for the new ones.
---
Who wants to bet the truth is they aren't even alone on the server they just made everyone invisible to each other. That's why it's parties of 8 so each sever can host 3 parties with no one the wiser.
---
Break the computer and burn it then build an Xbox with it and buy Xbox game pass to play the outerworlds
---
Mine works fine
---
Imagine the white dude blinking meme GIF here.
---
It's a saying. Meaning unfair advange
---
Hahahaha, okay. Sure
---
Yeah that's sort of the problem.
---
But it's not like I'll ever get through to people. I'll just let it go by the wayside, like every other movie quote that drones repeat.
---
Oh look, the pondlife masses are getting restless again (takes a sip of Chianti).
---
(That‚Äôs how it goes in your head right?)
---
&gt; brand new world
---
Multiple people reported that they are used. I dont even care about that part. Iam just interested if they are used because ( as someone said here ) other players got kicked when a sub loaded in.
---
This ship we are on? Yeah, I think it is time to jump it.
---
They really fucked up this time.
---
Advantage to do... what?
---
No remember that one kid that was obsessed with horses? Saying that one day horse armor will rule Cyrodil!
---
Hord scrap
---
This is just like the repair kits situation . A ton of loud folks on the Reddit create a sense that there is a large backlash when in reality only some people consider this an ethical issue and most people just shelled out the cash or didn‚Äôt and went about their respective days. The repair kits and ‚Äúutility items‚Äù are the best selling stuff in the shop. The numbers don‚Äôt lie, we did this to ourselves. Everyone complained about the junk robots yet I found one at every damn player camp I visited the day of release. The internet is a lot of talk. Half the people complaining probably bought the membership too. I did.
---
Because those are on randomized loot tables... People understand that a private server is still running on the same netcode as the public server right? This isnt Fallout (4) 76. It's still the same online randomized loot containers game.
---
I don't "mind" 1st. I won't get all internet angry like others have but I will say it sucks they said that inventory will be limited due to stability issues. Now that's out the window and they put a price tag on it. *Sigh*
---
I'd love to see them put more adventurous stuff into the game, and they will soon with the NPC update so maybe this was just poorly timed.
---
Overall, I don't mind paying Bethesda if they gave back a little more in terms of regular updates to the game. New music, new guns, more stable and predicable events out in the wasteland, I can go on and on. I don't have regular friends to play the game with so a lot of the group content (like private servers and the tent) go right over my head. I'd love to do the Vault dungeon but I have no clue where to begin to get a group. 
---
Lastly, add some more achievements? I play a majority of my Xbox games with a goal in mind... To 100% the game but will drop it when I can't really see a point anymore. 
---
This post was all over the place, I know. I'm a huge Fallout fan who loved and adored 76 when it came out but my interests have moved on and I'd love for a reason to come back but this wasn't it. Maybe Q1 will be better.
---
You seem like a fun person...
---
Free loaders, are you serious? People payed $60 for this game already.
---
This is so neakbeard-y
---
You can't sell out of the scrap box, you would have to transfer it, which then would take space up. And besides, junk is incredibly easy to farm. You can farm most things faster than you can use it so, it's more of a convience than an actual advantage. And again, the crafting bag in eso made almost np difference to non plus players. And that game has a vendor/merchant set up too.
---
Lol you can't support the "uninstall" by displaying it through an installed game
---
I pre-ordered the Power Armor edition for me, and three copies of the Tricentennial for my wife and two boys so we could all play together on launch day. I have been defending this game since the BETA, but this is the final straw for me.
---
I've uninstalled Fallout 76 on all four computers along with the Bethesda launcher.
---
Wake me up when Fallout 5 comes out. I'm going to read the reviews before I pre-order next time.
---
I can attest to both situations mentioned above. Deposited a crap load of aluminum and it's gone. Went to a world to farm lead (from gym weights), which I haven't done in months - all gone.
---
It's both.
---
And yes, it's unlimited *scrap*, not storage.  The stuff you break down that goes into the Junk tab.
---
But the private servers are not paid DLC, they are a optional feature based on player feed back and they dont need to exist inorder to play the game. They also place stress on servers. I dont see why people are freaking out. If you want a private server, pay for it. If you don't, oh well, you still have a game and free DLC to play.
---
Last I saw he was being carted off somewhere
---
Fuck em all just to be safe. I'm passing on the next DooM because of the ambiguity of everything.
---
So winning = more scrap than the other guy?
---
Ahhhh so thats how it works allright :D thanks for explaining
---
What?
---
He was trying to cross the border right? He got caught in that one imperial ambush
---
So you actually believe that they will actually implement modding after all this? Huh.  
---
People have discovered that the "private servers" are not actually new but are just normal older servers that have had a privacy filter thrown on them. If they couldn't handle 3 nukes at once or item duping, how the heck are they going to handle mods?   
---
Also, who the hell is going to mod this thing? I can't see anyone from the Nexus community coming withing 100 miles of this garbage fire. We had a few mods early on that weren't cheats and Bethesda came down HARD and banned anyone caught using them.
---
To an extent. It shouldn't be a feature similar to the fridge
---
Yeah just look at how successful it was with press on release! /s
---
Keep paying them, these stories are actually funny.
---
Scrapbox
---
You dont HAVE to pay, dipshit. It's a choice.
---
Not sure why you've got downvoted, in the files it's called a Gladiator Outfit, no mention of the legion.
---
Ugh...criminal scum
---
Yeah, they are choosing to keep the game bugged out because of the outrage, that explains why it stayed as buggy for as long as it did.
---
Gotta cater to the predominant players of the game somehow
---
You know exactly what I mean though. Yes?
---
That breaks the cosmetic only promise right?
---
How many hours do have so far?
---
Display issue or not, it puzzles me why Bethesda implemented the Scrapbox as they did.  It seems like a more straightforward approach would have been to recycle the same tags they use for vending or CAMP displays and create a new one that zeroes the weight, but still allows it to appear in your Stash with a relevant icon beside it.
---
Because the Scrapbox and the Stash Box are blind to each other's contents, it makes one wonder where the Scrapbox junk actually "lives."  It also opens up this odd edge case of what happens if you become lose your Scrapbox and are unable to craft another one (i.e., you un-subbed).
---
Bug fixes? It's definitely less buggy then on release... Not that that's a high bar but it's still true.
---
I honestly doubt you're getting death threats.
---
This just sounds like a way to deflect the blame onto the people that have valid complaints about Bethesda and the game.
---
Most of the shit on the atom shop is just ripped from other bethesda games or lazy re-textures, you're a dumbass if you think the atom shop has any sort of value.
---
And yet if you tell people about paying money for atoms, they tell you "oh bUt YoU cAn GrInD tHeM fOr FrEe So It'S nOt My FaUlT yOu PaId FoR tHeM. " Never mind I *never* got the game to grind for atoms in the first place. I got the game to (shocking concept incoming, brace yourself) play the game. Mind blowing concept to some, apparently.
---
Perhaps we are paying for a dedicated server for our stuffs?

* That is actually a feature, kind of.. In some specific locations when another player joins a respawn will occur, frustrating at times but intended (generally) but there are some exceptions where chain spawns due occur that should not.  
---
* Thanks for the confirmation, will add it to the pile!  As for the Scrap-Box I have some details above for situations that seem to be linked to it happening, avoid those and hopefully it will reduce the chance.  
---
* That's knew, where did this happen? Well the healing is normal but the double spawn might not be.  
---
* Yes, have that logged, it seems a fair number of people are seeing that.  
---
* Linked to the Favorite's Wheel bug, when it first happened a few months back it also introduced a good deal of lag when switching weapons, hopefully since it's a "Best Hits" (repeat) bug they should be able to fix it quickly.
---
Thanks, keep adding them, the more the merrier!
---
You do realize that even if just 50 000 players, which is just 3% of the total sales, buy the sub fee for 1 year, it's still ~5 million dollars they make off it.
---
Even just 5000 players will feed them a 0.5 million a year of almost pure profit. They don't have to get a "large" population for this to be profitable, it already is. As they've said, it's a side project, meaning, they don't want to *invest* money in it more than they have to for it to make money.
---
Sounds really fun! Cgs
---
That's a completely different game. And still this game was only supposed to add things that were cosmetic not things like the fridge or scap bot. No matter how much a convince they are or not that much not an advantage they are still pay to win
---
I've been around since beta and really only stuck with it to get my money's worth out of this game. I never bought any atoms, luckily, nor did I ever really care about the repair kits since the scorchbeast queen spat them out. However, the pass is the last straw for me. 76 is officially dead to me on the same level Anthem is.
---
Forgive me, Mothman, for I have sinned.
---
Not a lot to be honest. If I had to guess maybe three hundred hours?
---
That's not how that works, ya cunt!
---
See, and I'm not getting it. I see all the hate for private servers, but I even have friends on my friends list buying them up and using them as "trade hubs" and whatnot. Majority on this sub, but apparently not in game.
---
Thanks as always!  
---
[PSA - Forest Scout Armor needs a new "Paint" applied to allow the Preview to display correctly.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmk5lz/psa_forest_scout_armor_needs_a_new_paint_applied/)  
---
As for the Visual bug, anything else happen that was odd?
---
The world I was on  for 5 hours today wasn't used. 2 of my friends from my friends list joined me (that I saw).
---
I hit whitesprings twice, enemies respawned both times (probsbly 3 hours apart for my trips).
---
I took over the ammo plant and made 308.
---
Had no lag or anything close to that.
---
Around 5 hours in, I did notice a freinds list friend on, pounding the galleria, and the game froze.  I doubt it was because somebody else was on "my" world.  I did immediately try to join him, and was brought to an adventure mode world.
---
It's actually great playing solo.  I enjoyed it.
---
Ok simp
---
You realize these arent fixed locations for these items right? They won't always show up at least
---
Did that silo seem lagged overall or just a long long pause?
---
Cant relate, honestly my worlds have been full, making events so much better
---
Is it possible beth is hosting multiple parties on a server and just making them invisible to each other?
---
No
---
I would call my experience here on Xbox "sparse"
---
I can hear ' [adagio for strings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KylMqxLzNGo)' playing in the background.
---
Has to be an issue on your end. No joke it‚Äôs been months since I‚Äôve been booted. Played for 6 hours straight today. No issues
---
And nobody got kicked from the adventure world I joined. I left after 25 minutes.
---
I miss being able to ruin my whole save by killing important npcs
---
Gotta love it. To think they could‚Äôve saved for outer worlds or cod hahaha
---
Yeah was really awesome to get that kinda reaction so soon! Thanks :D
---
Actually all players should get a three month free trial of the premium subscription as a thank you for sticking around and a chance to try out the benefits.
---
Indeed
---
I can still say something about the shitty membership though
---
Wow and runescape also don't require u to spend $60 for the right to even play on top of a subscription, and both games have a lot more content, and are less buggy.
---
Everything about this game is a fuckin scam. The $60 entry fee was a scam
---
People I play with don‚Äôt have issues either... interesting...
---
Are you autistic or something?
---
Been playing this game since BETA and after this move I can say with certainty that Th and the mngmt yes men can all go phuck themselves. 
---
I‚Äôm done with this game and I‚Äôm done with Bethesda until there‚Äôs some serious direction and Managment change there.
---
You fuckers will never learn. That's why Bethesda keeps shitting on us players like this. They use you as the scapegoats.
---
Will you still play the game, buy things from the atom shop and buy the subscription if they don't give you anything free? 
---
Because if the answer to that is anything but a *hard* no, they obviously just wait until you cave.
---
But with rules from adventure? Gosh the reasoning here is impeccable.
---
Yea you could say that I live in a unique spot on the map that creatures dont spawn
---
Thank you for the comment.    
---
\-Tesla hum, that is weird, were you able to ever remove it (swapping weapons, reloading, firing, etc)?  
---
As for the rest of this list, fantastic, will attack it later tonight or tomorrow!
---
Everyone I‚Äôve ever known to play this game has issues.... super weird o.O
---
Thanks mate for finally making a valid point about Fallout 1st and at the same time help the marine ecosystem. Just remember that Fallout 1st is still overpriced heavily and bug fixes for it still need to be implemented, I still support Fallout 76 and the franchise it comes from and always will, but if we get so little for giving so much then what is the point? Best of wishes and support from Sydney, Australia ;)
---
Seems like they got a centimeter then took three more centimeters.
---
I still enjoy it honestly. The public event system is actually working decently now and it's made doing events better than it's been since the update that changed them. I've also seen more high levels in servers lately as well. And apparently on Xbox at least, people are buying up private servers so..
---
Sorry, I don‚Äôt understand.
---
I did a fresh copy/paste of all the file (both exe and ini on both folders) as the guide says, as I did the first time. 
---
I can‚Äôt even find the line you‚Äôre mentioning, in any .INI file, I think it‚Äôs not present at all.
---
What do you mean with ‚Äúupdate the renamed exe‚Äôs‚Äù? Thanks :)
---
It‚Äôs a business... it‚Äôs a game... if you don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt play it. ESO literally is set up almost identically with subscription service, this isn‚Äôt a shock at all. 
---
Valid complaints... of course, whining and trashing people with a different opinion as 90%+ of the trolls on here do are the toxic reason people are buying servers and not listening.
---
The second basically. They took some popular feature and content requests (ranger outfit, unlimited storage for junk, "private" servers to name some) and put it behind a subscription
---
Do you al have crap internet or play on PCs below spec?
---
"It seems, Lord Todd, that in your anger.... you killed fallout." - Darth Community
---
This makes so much sense, and damn is it hilariously sad
---
Hmmmm ü§î
---
They're losing people, not money. For every regular player they lose 3 more whales open their wallets. 
---
That said, not convinced it's a good long-term strategy for the company, losing Goodwill matters more with each new release... But methinks the shareholders don't care.
---
Feel the pain, having similar problems and being written off as well..
---
May i offer a suggestion? Go to the microsoft store. Pick up a month of game pass ultimate for $1. 
---
Check out The Outer Worlds. It just launched, Im having fun. It's something to play while 76 is busy shitting itself into a coma.
---
My private server I logged into with my partner, both over 100. Spawn into whitesprings with lvl 9 enemies.  But they‚Äôre supposedly not recycled servers üôÑ
---
They don‚Äôt want to sell more. They want to throttle the remainder.
---
All of the  "perks" of fallout 1st should be base level items. Like having to pay for a private server you already paid $60 for is insane. All of this is just greed.
---
It wont do anything either way
---
You need box live to play any game online on Xbox lol. And internet! And electricity!
---
&gt; if you are part of a company that is getting valid criticism, you are contributing to the product being criticized.
---
Dude I wrote code that killed people.  
---
I mean they probably deserved it, but I don't think you have a realistic view of how mortgage companies work.
---
It's not pay to win, it's pay to play (better stability, no latence, working vault raids and more).
---
It's worse than pay to win. They turned me into a second class citizen, but I paid full price for it.
---
I can't in good conscience buy a bundle packed with stuff that should be available for everyone in the base game. I'd rather be paying for a "private" server and get some bonus atoms on top of it than to pay for what we're getting now. Put the armor in the Atom Shop so people who want it without the subscription can still get it and also so that people can wear it without instantly being judged by a bunch of people for getting the subscription. Put the scrap box in the main game, already available to everyone straight out of the vault. Put the forward tent in as a quest like the backpack and then put skins for the tent in the Atom Shop.
---
You are possibly the biggest fucking idiot on this sub. Buying this subscription effects those of us who don't pay for it because of more features that we request will be put behind a pay wall. No matter how you slice it, unlimited junk it pay to win. Take your L and go.
---
You appear to be conflating this brouhaha with a class struggle. The haves versus the have-nots.
---
How do you fuck up a fuck up by fucking it up even more?
---
Bethesda: hold my jet.
---
I have a few games I've half finished or wanted to start playing, but now that outer world's and MW are out, il be playing them. For MW, I'm waiting to buy it as well. I learned my lesson with bo4, and everyother bad preorder (except WW2, I enjoyed it from the day of beta to 9 months in) I still enjoy this game, even though it's a buggy mess.
---
Does Todd taste that good holy shit, some people are actual sheep
---
Enjoy the buggy scrap box.
---
Edit: I'm loving the downvoting. It really shows how much of a "cult" this place can be. People are stating objective facts, and you're just sitting here  saying "no, this game is great! And it has no issues, please Bethesda take my money."
---
And, I was hesitant to use the unlimited scrap chest, but did leave a bunch of stuff in there, and after the game crashed and I rejoined an adventure world I did fast travel to my tent, and all my junk was there.
---
I think he just meant they use the server space from survival mode to host the private servers now
---
it wasn't a slope... it's  a damm dead drop by this point lol.
---
Actually I‚Äôm not sure if private games hosted by us would work for fallout 76 because of how account information is stored, it‚Äôs stored in Bethesda‚Äôs database not on our internal storage, the least they could do is give us actual private servers.
---
Their support has always been horrible ime. Because vats causing crashes with melee weapons only is something they blame on Microsoft? 
---
I would understand if it happened with all vats kills this excuse would be somewhat plausible imo, but because of the specific conditons and no limiting factor on the xbox itself except that the game is hanging indefinitely.
---
I honestly doubt they're getting death threats. This seems to be a common tactic used by avid supporters of a game when it gets rightfully criticized, they deflect by laying the blame on the criticizers and throwing some red herring like "These meanies said I should kill myself" with no proof. If they really wanted to deal with it they'd report it to the moderators and provide screenshots of said users.
---
See it happening time and time again.
---
Todd has you now!
---
I bought it yesterday and loving it! You have my upvote... prepare now for haters and trolls downvoting...lol
---
I think it‚Äôs more the perversions of capitalism that is the problem with the gaming industry.
---
As technology has progressed people expect so much more for games and development takes a lot more time and effort.  
---
As such big studios end up buying all these small studios once they have a hit game since they don‚Äôt want them to compete and well, they‚Äôre making investments.
---
These conditions basically have us where we are at where it‚Äòa difficult for new studios to get the capital to put the amazing games we expect out easily, and the ones that have get gobbled up by the bigger companies and lose creative control of their games.
---
It‚Äôs so disappointing over the past ten years to have amazing games followed up with worse and worse sequels.
---
Where is the line, if I may ask? Would you still buy their games? I really would like to know, after all people hate what Blizzard-Activision has done, especially lately, many have left them. But some still hand over money, so they will continue what they do.  
---
I get that is VERY different, however in this situation buying fallout 3 would say "Hay I like this game and I've supported the company without saying I support their new trends" But to buy another game that would be a 76 would say "this is fine, keep going" IMO.
---
Not Having Issues With It Its Only If U Have Alot
---
1)  Not sure I agree, was able to replicate it using a total of 20 scrap, twice, and I don't have the scrap in my box...  
---
2) Not sure I agree, clipboards and plastic utensils in Watago High aren't instanced to the player.   
---
3) We request the fix months ago, Anonymous mode, which most other games have.
---
YES!  
---
this! so much this!
---
Not sure what that has to do with the game. But to answer your question,  no I am not. But if you're looking for camaraderie with someone who does I'm sure there's some gaming subreddits for people with autism or other mental illnesses who I'm sure would love to have someone to play with.
---
I'm kind of surprised they're still trying with this game like they dug it a hole buried it and built a house on it
---
This has to be fucking baiiiiit
---
No. Servers all seem pretty full and public events are packed... nuclear winter matches are full as wel
---
What if...the death threats are COMING FROM WITHIN THE HOUSE!?!?!?
---
Spooky!
---
Man I am happy that out of the 10 people playing this game atleast 3-4 bought a month to get an iconic outfit, see you the coming months,
---
1st players are literal cucks hahahahaha
---
Wow, bad girlfriend. Get her on an older game at least
---
I think this should have been one of the disappointed options, it was number 1 so far for me.
---
Oh... A stranger on reddit thinks I'm not fun because I said a Dark Knight quote is lame :(
---
But for real, what a cliche comment. Genius though, any response in defense makes me look less fun and only proves you correct. So it successfully derails the conversation onto my character and lacking a trait people generally would like to have.
---
I have to say, it's scummy but I admire the effectiveness.
---
Everyone visiting it caused the server to be overwhelmed.
---
Absolutely. I didn't have time to check if the machine gun fix was actually fixed (because they was a tough issue to pin down and they already tried twice), but I also like the goo piles vanishing as soon as they are emptied.
---
its like the game itself is trying to delete itself with each mtx added to it...  
---
some real skynet shit is going on here.
---
The game has not become more buggy...
---
When I stow my weapon it's silenced. When I swap to a melee weapon it's silenced. But it comes right back with any ranged weapon. Different pitches as I swap.
---
I think it's the Tesla sound, but it could be the salvaged assaultron head sound. I'll check when I'm back from my gig tonight.
---
PS: Thank you for all your effort!
---
"I like big bucks and I cannot lie"

  -Bethesda
---
Improving the game takes work. They just want money. You can tell the effort they put into their shit by how broken it always is.
---
Bethesda signs off on the releases and in the end of the day it‚Äôs their name responsible. They don‚Äôt blindly sign a contract without any supervision on the final product
---
It's not a fabrication to point out that the current implimentation of a "private server" is essentially pointless.  
---
However, what they DID advertise is that they would be adding private servers to Fallout 76 nearly a year ago, yet only a week before it released made any mention of it requiring additional payment to access.  Why promise a feature for almost a year and then only state that it would be behind a paywall barely before it releases?
---
Uh huh...yeah, lol, I'm just _so_ mad; it's so frustrating when I'm unable to sponge off of others, the way you types do. You leeches should offer classes.
---
You da real MVP
---
That's insane, "They are paying for a service that's garbage, but that's business? Oh, but if you were nicer about it, they would not buy into the overpriced services?"
---
Seriously, I don't see how people can still defend this?! YOUR THE CONSUMER, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO BE MAD ABOUT THE STATE OF A PRODUCT!
---
It's official. The radiation is finally getting to this community.
---
I wouldnt really call what theyre doing at this point trying. Just fulfilling obligations with tos probably.
---
Haha awesome :-)

Very cool!

COMMUNIST DETECTED IN THE SUBREDDIT!

Why? It's not a singleplayer game. What fucking planet are you from?
---
What the hell are you doing here? Also she is my ex now.
---
Oh really? Seemed new when I entered them but could of been me. Does make sense though or you could server hop at a place like the Asylum and get guaranteed something every time.
---
Can confirm it is happening to some, was able to replicate twice and my junk is gone
---
Why did you paid for this shit in the first place? I guess you got what you deserve.
---
How does a voluntary subscription ruin your experience? Can‚Äôt you still play adventure exactly the same as before?
---
You‚Äôre just being really weird and seem like the type of person who can‚Äôt let others enjoy things without having to critique every aspect of whatever it is that they enjoy. You didn‚Äôt just say it‚Äôs a lame quote, you wrote an essay about why it‚Äôs lame. Just let it go lmao
---
That's fucking horrible. Absolutely disgusting now that I think about it like that. They're making people pay for mods in a way where they don't have to pay the modders for their work while they profit off it. Fucking despicable.
---
I had the game crash, and all my scrap was still in my scrap box. (crashed in private and I reloaded purposely into adventure to see if I would lose my scrap) 
---
Clearly there is an issue going on, but it seems to be being blown out of ball face proportions.
---
I stopped playing a long time ago, I come back here every now and then to see how people react to the latest thing Bethesda has done and see who is holding out and why. It's rather interesting to me how much faith some people have, how much hope some have. How much people want a Fallout game SO much, they still play this.  
---
Don't get me wrong, if you took Fallout 4 and did the same thing, where there was only the world, enemies and background story it would be... interesting... for a while. But it would be boring faster without a story, no matter how you view that story. People like this game, cool, but SOME try and ignore the issues to defend it. I get likeing the game, for example Battlefront II looked amazing and people say it was, aside from the crap EA pulled. But I still didn't buy it, because I didn't wish to support that kind of thing. IMO same rules apply to Fallout 76, I don't want to support what MODEL they are using, the lore, the action etc might well be really fun, but I won't support it.
---
Thanks for the tip and its interesting why that happens. If you do no paint option on an urban scout it changes it to forest. Lol   
---
As for anything else with the visuals, not really. Just stuck in that hazy vats screen and can't see enemies. When I fast traveled, it was still the hazy screen but could see enemies and thats when I tried vats again and it kicked me out of the bug and back to normal.
---
Same
---
Well said!
---
Here is the Problem. Metacritics of Fo76 are bad, a ton of youtubers review it very bad, Gamingsites/Magazins give it bad reviews even I played it and think its shit same as the 20 Gaming mates from other Games that bought it ( nobody of them plays it anymore since 1 month after launch). So either Fans / YTs / Gamingsites and my mates have conspired or there is something seriously wrong with this game.
---
Yet you keep returning to the Fallout 76 subreddit? Who's the one really enjoying it between the two of us?
---
Fair enough if you spend that much on atoms anyhow. I haven't spent a dollar on them, have a decent many items from atomic shop and still have 4k atoms
---
From what other users said it has, and apparently the subscription doesn't even work properly
---
No! That‚Äôs so disheartening to hear considering I was planning on opening up a bar with my C.A.M.P. I was going to call it ‚ÄúThe Blast Zone‚Äù with the tagline being ‚ÄúHave a Blast!‚Äù Perhaps the economy on the PS4 will be gentler to me. Great build with your C.A.M.P though!
---
Low effort bait.
---
You don't generally need Xbox live and the internet to play single player games though.
---
COMMUNIST DETECTED IN THE SUBREDDIT! LETHAL CLAPBACKS ARE AUTHORIZED!
---
Im serious
---
I actually think there is something more devious at work. Hear me out. These live service games cost money in devs doing updates, server costs, etc. I happen to think that since the launch was disastrous, sales are super way down. Like really way down. 
---
That's why I think they doubled down on the Atomic shop. They're trying to make their money back. What if they came out with this outlandish price for a private service because they're actually trying to kill the game? I think its very interesting that they pushed back wastelanders. I wouldn't be surprised if we never even get wastelanders.  I think Bethesda wants 76 to go away so they can stop spending money on it. It didn't turn out to be the cash cow they were hoping for and know I think they're trying to get it to die so they can move on.
---
Look at Anthem. It's the exact same situation. Free DLC was promised, but it had a terrible launch, the micro transactions went poorly, and now they have basically stopped all future updates.
---
Its an insult hes insulting you! These damn richies are feasting on mirelurk cakes in a bloodleaf aioli sauce sipping on lead champagne and rubbing our faces in it while us poors have to boil filthy water and eat dog food. Theyre hands will become soft and backs weak from not carrying junk. Their spirit will be easy to crush.
---
I'm aware, just not near my console atm to check but that's for the tip anyways!
---
I'm sorry but I just don't agree with anything you said here. We will agree to disagree.
---
Ive seen fallout 1st coming for quite some time. Didnt think it would come with a scrapbox though. Some other qol utility items wouldve been far less impactful imo. 
---
Couldve probably even pulled off the extra camp, but the scrapbox truely was their tipping point.
---
Lol. Beth has ebbed and flowed with the quality of their dlc since oblivion.  The dlc mtx economy is a beast beyond Beth. At least it's not digital gambling targeted towards children.
---
We won't see any significant changes until government policies regulate this mtx behavior.
---
Yeah it is, I mean 70% of the time when I log on I recognize at least a couple of the names, so that means the player base is small enough on PC for players that I don't interact with to be remembered just due to how often they are in the same server as I am.
---
He should have called it crapbox instead of scrapbox. Like I know that‚Äôs low hanging fruit, but that fruit is there for a god damn reason!
---
Some of the replies here are from absolute dumpster people. I‚Äôm sorry.
---
How do you stand playing with joysticks? When i was a kid it seemd normal but after my first kbm... Well you know.
---
Can you get kbm and own the other kids on the block?
---
Next question. Do you eat cheetos while playing?
---
This was a stupid comment.
---
Stay strong, Brother. ‚úä
---
Good by fallout 76 standards where single skins cost 20$, still hardly worth it when you consider what else you can get for that money.
---
7$ for Fallout New Vegas and all of its DLCs right now, and it doesn't come with the baggage of supporting greedy practices
---
Which has been a source of frustration from many people, and the private server is a way for people to play it single player. What fuckling part of this are you not understanding?
---
Finally a reasoned response to this, thank you
---
No, not really, I wasn't even thinking of that. My intention was was more on the lines of space faring citizens happening upon a planet and awakening an ancient race that decimates them, kinda like the Forerunner Saga.
---
If anything you appear to have conflated my conjecture as a serious discussion on class conflict. I added the "fellow" before Fallout 2nd cause that's the truth, I'm gonna play the game but just without the subscription.
---
All my junk gone as well over 400 pounds can‚Äôt access from crafting
---
So you don‚Äôt even play the game? I played 6 hours today. Zero issues.
---
 It‚Äôs when you crash while loading or force quit while loading. Try below. This will replicate losing your junk 
---
‚Äî Force quitting while loading into adventure and then loading into a private server is what caused me to lose my junk a second time ‚Äî
---
So that's why my carry weight stays the same when I drop 30k .45 rounds /s
---
Well you need to have some sort of brain damage to enjoy 76.
---
That describes literally all video games, sit down
---
/r/boneappletea
---
Because I want to play the game and enjoy it without Bethesda tugging at my wallet at every step? Why are *you* so happy to part with your money?
---
These people will pay hundreds of dollars to see a super hero multiple times. Pay 20 bucks for fucking popcorn and pop. 
---
But 12 bucks a month for some digital content in a game? Proceed to lose their fucking minds. 
---
100 bucks a year isnt that much money. Everybody is just jumping on the bandwagon like a wave. There is this surge of negativity because the 76 hate was simmering down and this erupted it. It's just internet circlejerking and will fade away yet again.
---
In the new year Wastelanders will come out and you will see posts from here on the front page again because it will be inevitably broken and poorly executed. 
---
This game is a just a fucking opera to witness now, nobody even cares about the gameplay and shit its transcended into an abstract concept.
---
Not many companies are very helpful with the customer support now most of the time if you have an issue and they dont have a fix they'll normally just close your topic and leave you in the dark
---
I dont really eat cheetos unless they are the ones mixed with popcorn at AMC theatres
---
Jesus fucking christ, sunk cost fallacy in action folks.
---
It works well for me, I have 700+ hours and so do many on my friend list. 
---
Sure it as a few issues but overall it‚Äôs been good. 
---
So please tell me what I‚Äôm suppose to be mad at? 
---
It‚Äôs also optional and not required literally at all for anyone to get the subscription... no one in game wins anything, they don‚Äôt do better either... it‚Äôs their choice to spend the money they earn anyway they please and they do!
---
Do you have the atoms for it?
---
Any online multiplayer game you do... which this is... when you host a private server... it‚Äôs still an online game... you still can invite people into your server... this is not an offline game.
---
If only! The game would definitely be better with me in charge! 
---
Unlimited Camp budget??? You Betcha!
---
You don't want to eat and drink all the time??? No probs, there's a setting to turn that off! 
---
3* enemies only drop 3* loot??? Heck. To. The. Yes!
---
May not be Todd, but I do run my own place! Come visit me‚Äîalways happy to make new friends in Joetown!
---
"The biggest", what about Anthem?
---
Content ‚Äúcreator‚Äù detected.
---
Yeah I can play it the same before, but with less perks now. I spent 60 at launch and there‚Äôs a paywall for cool cosmetics it‚Äôs just bullshit. I loved Bethesda, but the business choices have been shit lately.
---
Where is here? More basic conveniences? I've yet to hear anyone make an argument that suggests this is actually p2w.
---
I‚Äôm loving the music and decorations! (Also the 1st account which I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll be scolded for lol)
---
I think it's fair for the ranger suit to be cosmetic, that's fair. Also Bethesdas servers are the cheapest of the private server options (Battlefield, Minecraft) however it could be argued they're not true private servers
---
Pathetic.
---
I don't play ESO so I can't weight in on that comparison. but given the mechanics in Fo76, private worlds + infinite storage = infinite ammo and junk. you're essentially removing the micromanagement aspect of the game.
---
I'm not the first one to notice this, either. people are already abusing it. if you don't think infinite ammo is  p2w then I don't know what to tell you.
---
Or the reactionary knee jerk opinions?
---
Players are content. When the fish die, the whales migrate elsewhere.
---
What area is your camp in so i can keep an eye out.
---
Honestly don‚Äôt have the patience for the challenges, so kudos to you. I usually spend $10-$15 a month.
---
imagine paying 100 bucks on top of the 60 you paid initially to play a game the world mocks you for playing, then having that game steal all your items. 76 players need to seek professional help
---
Rightfully so: criticism of this game has been justified from the start and everything that has happened has only confirmed what everyone feared and loathed about bethesda's "experiment"
---
I don‚Äôt like the business move but it doesn‚Äôt compare to the torture of an abusive relationship. As an adult I choose to not give them money. I don‚Äôt mind people complaining in threads and making it known that it‚Äôs a dogshit move.
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean you have to brigade every post. Especially when someone is interested in the product.
---
Remember that No-Clip doco on the history of Bethesda?
---
How Todd said they were nearly broke and Morrowind was the last gasp attempt to save the company?
---
I feel they're getting closer to that stage with every release.
---
Huh?
---
Go get your snazzy mc ronald dip.
---
I had no clue Chris was active on Twitter, that makes me really happy
---
Beg to differ friend
---
Well you‚Äôre right technically it is easy to make things with all these engines out there, and inputs in the video game industry is just labour.  I think depending on the genre it also complicated things, I was thinking RPGs since that‚Äôs what I primarily love.
---
But, the amount of labour you need to pump some amazing rpg like fallout nv, dragon age origins, mass effect 1/2, is astounding.  Games like these could be in development for over a year to get done right, and the studio would need funding that entire time.  Animations, art, story telling, technical elements.
---
These big studios have all the funding needed but are like sharks in the investment world for video games.  Need to be more sources of start capital easily available but can you imagine pitching for that and the skepticism with smaller investors, and how many you would need?
---
Imagine if Fortnite Chapter 2 was just all the same skins from early access/previous battlepass but now locked behind new microtransactions.
---
That STILL wouldn't be as absurd as FO4 content in the Atom Shop.
---
Basics conveniences would imply it‚Äôs free for everyone. You have to pay to get these conveniences which is pay 2 win if people who don‚Äôt pay can‚Äôt use them. It‚Äôs not that hard
---
Good Bot.
---
Just north of Camden park!
---
I was always told it started with hats and Mann co stores in tf2.
---
You accept a team invite, new teammate‚Äôs friend who‚Äôs also on the server and isn‚Äôt currently teamed then engages in PVP with his friend, your new teammate, and by association you are now also engaged in PVP. They kill you take your junk, destroy your base etc. Just lame.
---
I‚Äôm all for it, bring the heat haters lol
---
Sucks that this is one the very few highlights of this game, but I‚Äôll take what I can get at this point.
---
Ok
---
Ooof. I mean if the game went free to play it would kinda be excusable but to still have to buy the game is bad. I was looking forward to the Wastelanders update but idk anymore.
---
I just want to point out that in no way is ESO free to play.
---
[prime example ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/dmos2m/bethesda_has_really_been_acting_like_a_freak_show/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
Wait, you have access to filthy water and dog food? And here I am trying to filter my own urine and licking the ground for nutrients.
---
I love it, friends randomly joined me and did what they had to do and left.
---
I actually like it better this way.
---
Me too!
---
It's still an online game first not single player.
---
Yeah, I quit as well. I preordered the game for beta access and played it right until September. I have 3 characters over level 100 and one over 200. I stood by this game and after this? I can't support it anymore, I don't have any interest in wastelanders anymore, knowing Bethesda now, I wouldn't be surprised if some content from that DLC is behind a paywall.
---
Nice homophobic comment.  Half the pop likes receiving, half likes giving.
---
Like, gosh, I'm so sad Beth doesn't care about me as an individual.
---
 How about sales were below what was the expected to sustain current and future development, so instead of reducing support for the game they decided to monetize certain *conveniences*
---
Checking if the game has improved and thought the op was sweet
---
Bought a year of it too and it‚Äôs glorious....moooaaannn......down votes commence
---
I feel like a lot of negative comments about devs, PR, marketing etc. got downvoted because people don't realise how true they are.
---
Pay2Lose?
---
I don't feel for them. The patronage of these individuals only contributes to Bethesda's continued piss-poor behavior. Without their support, Bethesda might actually be more receptive to the whole community, not just the select.
---
&gt; capitalism is the very reason a luxury entertainment product can exist
---
nope. pretty sure russian history under communism shows that arts and entertainment are not uniquely capitalist "creations".
---
OK, please tell me what is the disadvantage here? The goal of the game is who can collect the most junk?
---
The only people who say  ‚Äúsit down‚Äù after saying nothing of importance are people who enjoy getting pegged. 
---
Also at least other video games offer actual content with their pay walls
---
I play in total silence but can feel the rhythmic beat since my laptop is on vibrate.
---
I grew up on a NES, upgraded to an N64, moved on to a Xbox then had a weird time where I was just stuck playing C&amp;C Generals and CS 1.7 and then I just fell back into playing on consoles with PS3 and PS4. I guess it just doesnt bother me much. I dont play competitively but I'll accept the days when I get my ass handed to me or spread the kick ass.
---
And I forgot to mention, you have the option for KBM on ps4 but I never tried to configure it and dont have much knowledge on how it would work.
---
Fucking hell this tickled me.
---
Alright
---
Color me damaged then.
---
So tired of this post.  I really hope you get all the upvotes for this one. This and other posts like this are worse than the ‚Äúshould I come back‚Äù posts. Please stop.
---
Zero.
---
Sure, that was a mistake by Bethesda.  Sustaining an online game with free DLC only supported by skins and outfits while also providing a lot fo free atoms never seemed viable to me.  Would you be happier if they just shut the game down?  I wouldn't.   I suspect the same people losing there shit now were the same ones upset they couldn't get everything free before they added any QOL items to the atoms store.
---
I play Nuclear Winter almost exclusively. Others also play, as my matches are generally full. So you should not be making your own assumptions about what the game community wants/doesn't want.
---
If bethesda is telling the truth, yes
---
Maybe, hopefully it's because they're busy working on Wastelanders while subs help continue supporting the game.
---
Imagine belittling people for what they enjoy in the bedroom. And yes I do, why? Are you offering? ;)
---
Me and my entire team are gonna enjoy the shit out of of my private server, stay mad and lonely lmao
---
No you can't. You actually pay for internet after you pay for internet. No one fuckin person cares what you think. You're clearly mentally handicapped.
---
You're asking the wrong question...should be asking "what do I do if I have low intelligence and low charisma?"
---
The answer is, don't post on the internet.
---
https://youtu.be/sHbXEouo7fk newest video explains it
---
We knew it was coming when people vehemently supported stuff like dlc horse armor.
---
Are we not allowed to have opinions?
---
But fallout 1st isn't a season past, neither a dlc.  
---
Renting a server usually costs about the same as what they are asking
---
A cult of whiners who want a online game to have updates and fixes for free when it‚Äôs not possible without money. It‚Äôs a business, if it‚Äôs not making enough money it‚Äôll go under.
---
I'm not parting with my money because I dont part take in microtransactions. If you need cosmetic items to make you enjoy a game, then you might be gaming wrong.
---
Outer world's releases soon if you like first person rpg's
---
Borderlands 3 released not to long ago if you like looter shooters
---
Aside from the epic drama on pc both are leagues more consumer friendly and deliver on the nostalgia of their fanbases than this depressing train wreck of lies.
---
Or you can do what I did and take up a new hobby painting wargame miniatures until the exclusivity period runs out (though outerworlds is also available through Microsoft instead)
---
That doesn‚Äôt actually sound that bad. Might check it out
---
It kind of is, but the thing that's upsetting is everything they promised to not do at E3 they have clearly went against. The atomic shop was going to be purely cosmetic. Granted, I stopped playing back in March, so I'm not entirely up to date, but from what I can tell, Bethesda is corrupted with greed.
---
We‚Äôre exactly is infinite ammo? I haven‚Äôt made ammo in 721 hours yet, made a few fusion cores but I get all my ammo either from enemies or finding it. 
---
A big part of Private worlds is due to griefing and PvP‚Äôers instigating or trying to trigger PvP with pve players... they say ‚Äúit‚Äôs part of the game‚Äù... well now private servers are part of the game so I guess we can say the same thing now. 
---
I‚Äôve met a lot of great people on here to include those that PvP... unfortunately we all know there are players that only care for themselves and purposely ruin others experiences. 
---
Look at this sub Reddit how many posts talk about one shotting legendaries and screwing over other players... 
---
Trolls when killing the queen and the list goes on! 
---
Blame and a good amount of it I might add falls on the lap of those mentioned above. 
---
They brought it on, your problem should also be with them.
---
Funny enough..one of the first names of my bar was Blast Zone!

you deserve this lol
---
I no the best place to get them if u have lvl3 lockpick
---
Can the stuff you get be used in public servers? I'm mostly wondering about the tent and the junk storage.
---
I was pretty sure the base game was?
---
I'm sorry, but was Todd not the one who gave the sales pitch for it to a massive audience? Hyping everyone up for it and saying its 4 times bigger than fo4? Doing tons of interviews for it? 
---
So yea I'm blaming him too.
---
Why? This is kind of a plateau of where they were headed?
---
Pot meet kettle
---
It's "Fallout 1st" not "Fallout First"
---
And why would they register that domain? They don't register any other random Fallout names like brotherhoodofsteel.com? Is this what shitposting has become?
---
yeah, I don't think so. to this day some of my criticism is still getting downvoted. I'm still getting called paranoid, alarmist, tinfoil. namely on the topic of disappearing items because "never happened to me lol"
---
if you and the rest of this sub had listened then maybe things would be different now. this is, for better or worse, one the last remaining Fo76 communities on the internet.
---
you deserve everything that comes next. I've been laughing all day long thanks to the scrap box fiasco.
---
Not really. Scorchbeast drops a 1* craps for both of us. I could hear the swearing from his room
---
and they did say that you needed to rent from them the private server when they started talking about it
---
I believe so blubber hips
---
Yeah, this game shouldn‚Äôt have been released until wastelanders was there, even all the DLC they‚Äôve added doesn‚Äôt get to even 1/4 of a fallout game
---
"A fool and his money are easily parted"
---
Show me a burgeoning video game industry under a socialistic economic system.
---
The billion that flourish, the contracts, professionals and resources needed are by their definition interlinked by human greed. Not pure greed, but everyone has a self-interest. That's the cornerstone of capitalism, to get paid/rewarded by the effort put in. This isn't always reality, the rewards compared to the work put in can absolutely suck but that happened far more in socialistic societies.
---
By the by, Russian writers have produced some stellar but harrowing literary works of art. Crime &amp; Punishment is a classic
---
It depends on how precise you want to be, really. It‚Äôs not a huge amount of muddying in the grand scheme if people keep participating, but it does make a difference.
---
Wow that‚Äôs crazy üòÇ. Honestly the biggest challenge for me will be finding a way to make a crude mushroom cloud next to the sign using some of the wall items overlapped with each other.
---
So, wait. You're telling me that you're fine with bait and switch tactics? That's pretty fucked up.
---
Well, I get that. But I'm assuming they expected it to fare better in sales when they said those things and thought they had to find a way to continue the financial support. Of course, this is the path of easy-moderate resistance. But at least, at this point they are selling gamble boxes.
---
I'd like to see this as a means to financially support their free updates like Wastelanders.
---
From all the stuff I read here the last two days that is gonna be either 5 bucks or something or just brought down.
---
If its whats needed for part 2 then I'm totally down for it
---
I have nothing against those modes and play(ed) them as well.
---
I was 13 when Fallout 3 came out.
---
Shame you never learnt to spell stroke though.
---
you "suspect"? really? you're still not sure?
---
goddamn, that ego.
---
Yes
---
Of course I play the game, I'm not some prick on the internet, to that extent, I haven't played in a month or so, the game isn't that enjoyable anymore, from what people say, doesn't really make me want to play it again
---
Fame happened, then the creation of Zenimax happened, then greed happened, and here we are
---
I mean if you think about it, fo76 is just a dumbed-down re-released version of fo4.
---
Well shit.
---
Good job being objective. Sure, there are things I don‚Äôt like about the game, but I think I have gotten what I want out of it. I think there will be more good stuff coming up in the future.
---
What the actual fuck! Are you for real? Is this like some hidden camera show? I knew fallout player were special but this is next lvl.
---
Grow some thicccc skin.
---
Does the scrap bench, survival tent, repar kit, scrap kit, fridge and scrap collector look like cosmetics to you? Are you dyslexic?
---
I vote with my money. I didn't buy the new cod, but I like it. 
---
On the ones I did play, I didn't like loot boxes so I didn't buy them, but I like the game so I bought the game. 
---
This is the same, I'll buy FO3 cause it's what I wanted. I won't buy fo1st. Protesting it and fighting does a lot more than you might think. And every cult classic must die. I know more about elder scrolls history than real life history. But I know it'll die. It's less of a line and more of a squiggle. I guess. Idk. I'm just mad.
---
It was doing decent then they decided to delay the only thing keeping most people interested and make the game pay to win in the same week.
---
My buddy just read that it‚Äôs a visual glitch apparently. Go to a crafting bench and see if you still have access.
---
And you could have also been one of the people whose characters got deleted, bugged out [that guy who couldn't die].
---
I didn't mean you need to be mad, if your happy with what you paid for great, I mean those voicing their concerns. People have a right to voice their concerns, and I see more trolling from people blindly defending a corporation.
---
Optional, I hate that excuse. For example, I'll quit commenting on this post if someone give me a gold.
---
No one, in their right mind, would do that. But, its optional!
---
Optional "content", expected but sectioned off an pay-walled is a terrible way to produce content for games. [I'm referencing to private servers by the way.]
---
Also, limitless scrap is technicality pay to win, but from what I've read it doesn't work anyway. [The game and its systems being built around scrap, repair, and item production looses all weight if a player can farm and store infinite scrap.]
---
  Somehow with nothing to do, I have played almost 1000 hours and had fun, what a rip-off.
---
So I quit way before in the past but I forgot to unsubscribe from this subreddit so I been trolling around but I‚Äôll ask this, how and why is it toxic to have a good build that one shots legendaries? All your group gets it so does it matter?
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
There is no free 'launch'.  (I am a programmer)
---
Do the Mothman dance for us.
---
It‚Äôs not even a fortnite clone haha fortnite is fucking *better*
---
For a game I paid 60 bucks for, play almost everyday, and want to continue playing it without it being taken offline, yeah I‚Äôm fine with it.
---
&gt;Vitriol
---
Lmao
---
So With ur logic even if a company said something 100 Years ago it has to be forever that way? Things change get on with it
---
Feel free to have your opinion.
---
Should a person with an opinion that is exactly the same opinion as the last dozen people who made new posts, then make their own new post stating their opinion?
---
Not really.
---
Not exactly. How many outsiders will look at the matter deeply enough to come to that conclusion? Once they see someone saying the customers ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù anything that happened to them, they‚Äôll likely assume the worst and may not look any further. Happened in places like Homestead PA, during the strike. If things spiral out of control, it can happen again, but with substantially less bloodshed. Public opinion is fickle like that.
---
Thing is
---
\- Theoretically, you're renting their server
---
\- They actually said it was with a monthly fee.   
---
problem is, it is buggy
---
Bye Felicia
---
Servers are just pieces of hardware with software loaded on them, like computers. Magical i know. They just made a new type of profile for people to connect to them.
---
&gt;Damage bug was reintroduced in Patch 13, are you a Bloodied build?
---
Honestly, I don't really have a set build yet. I am only level 26, so I still have a long way to go. This has been random for me for the last little while. If it matters, I am not really focusing on melee or firearms, I am just getting whatever looks good at the moment, whether it be fore weapons damage, or carry capacity assistance.
---
&gt;That's knew, where did this happen? Well the healing is normal but the double spawn might not be.
---
I can't recall the exact name on the map, but I do know it was on the North Eastern side of the map (a little South of Abbie's Bunker I think?), on a road, a truck was hanging from vines on a tree, and we were fighting Wendigos. It started with only two of them, and we ended up having to fight probably close to 10 of them in the end because of the constant spawning a new one as we died. I managed to find a place where it was hard for them to hit me and I cheesed the fight. It was definitely one of the more aggravating fights. 
---
Another time it happened was on a golf course, and we were attacked by maybe 5 ghouls. We both died, as there were stronger players around and the ghouls had maybe 30 levels on us. We came back for our stuff and now there was maybe 10 ghouls. We came back again, and I died before I could count, but there was definitely more than 10. I ended up just saying screw it and left my junk there and moved on.
---
There were other times as well, but these were the most recent I can remember.
---
It‚Äôs always a minority in every game, but it‚Äôs easier to make an argument sound legit when the minority can claim it represents everyone. You can‚Äôt disprove it unless it‚Äôs a steam game with public stats- though you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd notice if r/CSGO is barely 3% of the community odds are it‚Äôs the same across the board.
---
No one cares
---
Thats what i thought as well. but its just not there. I tried in build mode and benches.
---
I listened, but eventually they start to grate on you. Thankfully there's mods on PC to change out I didn't know the gun was loaded radio
---
ESO was still a decent deal when it came outr, fallout first has almost nothing
---
Fuck that membership I'm buying it at least once
---
Thanks for the response. Now I see why people are upset. I thought it was only for private servers.
---
No one needs unlimited junk space. No one needs more then 100 of any one scrap at a time. It does not give an edge. 100 or 2000 of the same junk scrap doesn't really make a difference.
---
The unlimited junk space is a crutch for people who can't manage their inventory.
---
Why are you people like this?
---
Just out of curiosity what is your professional background?
---
I use it too. Gotta do the daily rewards stuff which give you a couple hundred points. The mobile searches and bing search engine searches is another couple hundred and you get occasional emails with more points offers. Plus there's a new option, I think an app, but not sure. $60 is obtainable. 
---
The hardest part about it is using bing because when you have it as your default engine, you quickly realize it's inferiority to google when you're using it   .
---
Well for what it's worth, the problems of the game didn't seem to stem from it's cool massive open world, interesting folklore/lore, new enemy types, etc. The game suffered from the predatory microtransactions and now P2W practices, but I think I get where you are coming from.
---
Not sure what the point of this post is... but keep on keeping on dude/dudette! 
---
If you're enjoying the game and staying above the fray, then good on you
---
It was PS4.
---
What perks are you not getting? Like...all i can see is that you don‚Äôt get access to private servers or the fucking scrap thing and the fucking tent or the 1k atoms per month. Furthermore you would have always had to pay for the ranger outfit, even if it went up on the atom shop.
---
League of Legends skins can cost more. It‚Äôs not unique to 76, unfortunately.
---
This might shock you, but people like to list their grievances with things. You're not forced to look at them.
---
They‚Äôre a scummy company, of course they were going to pull this shit. Where‚Äôs LadyDevann and Lonevaultguy? Where are they now? Lmao looking for better jobs I hope
---
Stop playing this stupid fucking game. Stop giving them your money. They continue this bullshit because people continue to fall for it. I loved fallout too but this ain't it chief.
---
If you show up to events and one shot a legendary before anyone else can tag it, then you're an asshole.
---
I thought it was a joke that survival was dead, so whenever you played it it was basically a private world anyways.
---
&gt;We‚Äôre exactly is infinite ammo?
---
converted munitions factory, power plants. hold them indefinitely for infinite ammo. or just claim every workshop, scrap all the lead you can and craft them yourself.
---
&gt;A big part of Private worlds is due to griefing
---
if you're getting griefed in adventure then it's probably your fault. other than pumpkin grenades and mines, which require you to stand still and not have dense/fireproof on, there's no way to grief people.
---
I'll agree that playing with other people sucks sometimes. most of the time, in my opinion. but that's just the nature of Fo76. you can't blame people for being jerks, that's just *their* nature. blame Bethesda for making this always online and then CHARGING for the "privilege" of playing alone.
---
You just listed them dude
---
Saw it when he posted it
---
**(TLDR) It's because Bethesda simply doesn't want to acknowledge mod creators as the sole reason their game is still alive, and possibly company as a whole.**
---
Let's take Mojang and Minecraft, they know, accept and encourage mods because that's the lifeblood of the game. They continually update the game, but they know that people are there for private servers and eventually mods. Granted, they haven't done too much mod support but that could also be seen as a good thing (Minecraft not having official mod support means Forge gets to stay in business). On top of that, they literally charge nothing for it, sure you can get Realms, but nothing is stopping you from downloading their server jar and just doing it yourself. Same, I imagine goes for the developers behind Arma 2 although I have no idea the developer and modder relationship with that game so I won't comment any further.
---
Now Bethesda, they want to profit off the mods and really seem to think mod success comes secondary to their games. They think their games are the sole reason people stick around long term and modders just add cute little additional content. They seem to refuse to accept that modders are the only reason they are still in business. Take, for instance, Todd saying something along the lines of "Skyrim being a 10 year strong game and they want ES6 to be the same". Can we really sit here with a straight face and say "Vanilla skyrim is still fun"? Fuck no, shit's terrible, and the remaster made no attempt at fixing or "remastering" anything. There were tons of mods, readily available to fix Skyrim and none of it was utilized in the remaster.
---
Now part of it sits on the communities shoulders too. You, and everyone else saying, "modders will fix the game" is what directly caused this problem in the first place. Because then everyone would be saying "Oh Fallout 76 is awesome, just download these 100 mods and its playable!!" (which is pretty much what people do with Skyrim now) and then everyone turns around and praises Bethesda for such an awesome experience with hardly a thought going towards the modding community.
---
That's the difference.
---
Bro, you do realize their corporate company is ZeniMax, right?
---
PC master race and proud. Fallout has always been a console second franchise.
---
Cmon everyone needs to know you can buy first month of 1st and immediately refund your money back in the subscription option and still be able to keep all the stuff. Don't trust the scrapbook tho
---
The disadvantage of not having auto loot collection and infinite storage space for a premium is that the game dies quicker for those who don‚Äôt pay up. Why would I continue to play if someone can pay 99.99 to further their progress quicker, wether it is to collect the most junk or to have good loot? 
---
Why would I grind harder to get to a place someone has paid to be at? Pay 2 win.
---
Not only that, the ‚Äúcontent‚Äù this premium offers is as buggy and broken as anything Bethesda has released for the game. Entire loot stashes and junk stashes are being deleted and the ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù worlds are just servers that are not populated and have already been looted. We‚Äôre seeing dead NPC‚Äôs and already looted locations in ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù worlds. 
---
In a perfect world where Bethesda doesn‚Äôt fuck it up, this premium would of been worth it. But it isn‚Äôt, and it won‚Äôt be. 
---
If you pay for this you‚Äôre telling them it‚Äôs ok to release pure and utter broken shit. And that it‚Äôs ok to give in to shady business practices. Then everyone in the gaming community suffers.
---
Another game's greed doesn't justify it here. Still plenty of more reasonably priced things out there.
---
I'm sure the Russians slaughtered for making anti-Soviet art would agree.
---
&gt; the unstoppables outfit.
---
Wait, those outfits give you benefits?  I had no idea and all I wear is the Silver Shroud outfit.
---
Not two of the same ones, but absolutely one of each.
---
Yeah same for me. I am just happy Bethesda made their message clear now. It wasn't fair to keep players that are fundamentally against MTX in the dark.
---
The game needs to stand on its own without tricking people into playing it.
---
If the game can stand on its own with its intentions made clear then good if not then shut it down.
---
I like my MMO Lite in a fallout universe personally. Taking a break since my other favourite MMO Lite (destiny 2) just got new content.
---
Will be back once the new dlc drops.
---
Nope.   
---
Wanna bet that they're stable enough to actually handle mods as well?
---
That was humorous.
---
:)
---
Eh, I think it's a stretch to think that. Don't think that will be the case here.
---
Personally, while I don't think FO76 players deserve a shitty product, I must say that the warning signs were quite obvious but people were way too optimistic. I still remember a thread with people detailing all the elaborate roleplaying they wanted to do before the game launched. It's kinda sad.
---
Due to Bethesda being a subsidiary of ZeniMax, so far all of these additions have been a fallout version from ESO‚Äôs money makers.
---
Repair kits in fallout = repair crates (not sure on exact name) in eso
---
Scrap kits = Portable banker (portable banker is 1 time purchase though)
---
Fallout 1st =ESO+
---
So next I‚Äôm expecting
---
‚ÄúTired of seeing those old abandoned houses in the wastes?  Ever thought to yourself, I wish I could own it, Jazz it up, store more loot there and use it as an additional fast travel location?   Now for a low price of $20 ($30 furnished) you can!*‚Äù (pricing is per instanced house)
---
And then
---

Yeah, it should stay the same. Sticking to your word is a pretty important thing to do. Not doing that is a scummy degenerative thing to do. Kind of like the recent Blizzard fiasco, but no one in their right mind would defend that. Yet here you are protecting a company that goes against their own word as though they were some deity to be worshipped.
---
I never said I liked the subscription.
---
But people can spend their money on whatever they want
---
Wasn‚Äôt justifying it, but you implied it was unique to 76 - ‚Äú76 standards‚Äù. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs more current game standards sadly. Most popular games with skins are equal or far worse, like CSGO skins.
---
So if for example I‚Äôm running an Bloodied build, which i am, and it hits and kills something within one hit of the fully auto burst I‚Äôm an asshole?
---
Good on you! Personally I'll skip out, since I haven't been on that much anyway. Plus the subscription benefits won't help my game any better, since I already have a reliable weapon set and stores of crafting material among my characters. Plus I have all travel points unlocked and know my way around so the tent would be redundant.
---
‚ÄúCheckmate‚Äù BHahahaha! If I ‚Äútruly believe games only make money....‚Äù whoa there cowboy, hold on to your absolute declarations. You‚Äôre putting words in your ass. I never said ‚Äúonly‚Äù or made any claim that this is the sole means of funds for Bethesda or any company. I am saying that we live in a free market capitalistic society that allows and even encourages behaviors of charging for products and services (and that I‚Äôm glad to pay for a service that I so much enjoy). 
---
Yes, GTA, Minecraft, and many others offer content and updates for ‚Äúfree‚Äù but that‚Äôs not magically justifying your claim that a different company (Bethesda) must follow the same business platform. To make a claim as radical as yours, I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre being a commie! Hahaha. Too fucking hilarious, dude. I love it.
---
Go jerk of to New Vegas, you'll feel better.
---
Yep. Got back into the game recently after leaving a month after launch and started to have a bit of trashy fun. Just started a new modded game on Fallout 4 last night with Outer Worlds downloading in the back after the news :D
---
Because it encourages uninformed brigading from people that have no clue wtf they are talking about.
---
WHITE KNIGHT SPOTTED
---
Fallout 76 is over?
---
Nah fam. The world doesn't revolve around you. The game will keep going without ya.
---
I think much of the low res quality of Atom store goods it to reduce server load.
---
Really.  Okay.  Where to begin.  Hopefully I‚Äôve taken your bait. And now the switch. Yes you can have your own opinion however I can be tired of these posts clogging up my feed. Every time they have a patch this happens. Every time. Your pissed this guy‚Äôs pissed. Great. Good. You‚Äôve got feelings.  Wow   I didn‚Äôt buy madden because it‚Äôs the same game every year. No need to cry about it.  For fake internet points.  Get on YouTube and at least get advertisement money. Right?
---
Saw this down in the threads, it's literally pay to win if you think about it, because let's say, someone else has more money to spend on atoms for the in-game shop and has better gear than someone starting that doesn't have the luxury to spend money on the game, that's the very principle of pay to win. Granted, I don't think there's weapons on the atom shop, but where do they draw the line with what can be in the atom shop and what can't? It's basically turning into the creation club at this point.

I'm kind of surprised there's no small radio to loop that track in the package, or something like they did in the Xmas pack with a new set of emotes, the waving santa or the blow up snowman
---
Haha
---
No matter, he lied and being paid for it.
---
I did :)
---
Wait, how can it be teared and overflowing AND flaming? Do you not cry human tears?
---
They‚Äôre expected to maximize profits. Todd is just the face of it. Not the man upstairs
---
Is this tangible for a law suit?
---
Okay, and? The private servers are just the main game without anyone else. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs hardly a perk. You can achieve the same thing by walking around appalachia alone.
---
Out of all of those the only real perks are the tent and the fucking scrap thing which...fast travel‚Äôs pretty cheap anyway so...why bother with the tent? And the scrap thing‚Äôs not really an issue unless you‚Äôre a hoarder, which the game isn‚Äôt meant to be played that way which is why you lose your scrap upon death. 
---
Which just leaves the only real perk you would be missing out on aside from the private servers. 1.6k atoms a month.
---
But no, clearly a completely voluntary thing like this so they can keep the servers running is cause for a fucking screechfest.
---
You realize the junk stash is unironically the thing that requires the most money, right? Server storage, bandwith, and upkeep costs actual money which is the issue with Stash.  Some atoms and a skin are not what costs Bethesda money.  They are what the freebies should be, not a service that hinges on hardware.
---
If anyone truly thinks the junk storage is something they can give to everyone free then they have zero idea how programming and servers work and they should probably not actually make any more suggestions.  This is an issue with many other online games where character data and inventory can get bloated
---
Her, actually. And no, I didn‚Äôt want there.
---
Yes. Because you locked out every other player from getting the Legendary drop.
---
That's unfortunate I read about this visual glitch here too, must be more serious.
---
Shit. Apologies.
---
I get new games for free almost every day on PC. I'm not sure how that is a bonus.
---
I really don't give a shit, about karma. Look at my fucking account, and please tell me that I'm a karma whore. I state my opinion, be it popular or not.
---
I personally won't be buying any other Bethesda game unless 1) the reviews after a couple of weeks are legitimately good and 2) they don't fuck with modding. I used to buy Bethesda games day one, no questions asked, but Fallout 4 was the last time I ever did that for any company. And after the last year I don't trust them at all.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't require a subscription at all though for content. I personally do think 76 should be f2p. But, you're not missing out on any actual game content by not having the subscription. You get a private session and a couple little extras to go with the session. The game is still exactly the same and the subscription doesn't actually effect gameplay.
---
Alright man fuck my opinion I get it
---
Bug hit me as well took 800 lb or more of stuff and yeah it's definitely not a visual bug that's complete nonsense. I found out because I wasn't able to repair some of my stuff because I have zero of everything
---
Interesting view, don‚Äôt exactly agree but that has happened pretty much every time. I think people who actually care just leave and the next controversy just chips off a little more.
---
Full price, logged in the moment the 1st day of PC beta became available (after redownloading the whole game because Bugthesda), and stuck with it to level 300+ right around the time the purveyor was first released. Uninstalled after doing a single round of that slot machine, but was planning to return for wastelanders and private servers. These things are neither private, nor servers. 
---
Will not be reinstalling now, or ever.
---
At this point I can't even say "dang it Todd, It doesn't just work". This is something darker a more cruel than any bug or nerf could ever be.
---
I did lose a character, my main with a ton of challenges completed which are still listed on the account. Shows all completed ones, only thing that stayed was those and any account based atom purchases. 
---
I‚Äôm not mad at all... I just don‚Äôt get why some are so toxic against others opinions... we can all think whatever but I‚Äôm not going to call someone a name or trash them. 
---
Scrap deal really isn‚Äôt a big thing for me... my stuff is bulked and I‚Äôm good, I‚Äôm not a hoarder. 
---
Private server with friends was awesome, launched a nuke with my son, his first and we did a few events as well. 
---
Having a server with friends alone is totally worth it since you don‚Äôt have to worry about getting screwed over doing an event then someone one shotting the legendary... or knowing to activate the pylons or what to do in other events or what NOT to do that messes it all up. 
---
No one jumping servers, no one trying to instigate PvP, it was all good. 
---
So my experience has had some issues. It it‚Äôs improved and the private server was fun, not gonna lie.
---
I would never involve myself with someone who has poor control over their money. 
---
‚ÄúPrivate server‚Äù HA they‚Äôre just recycled, already looted, empty worlds Bethesda just fucked you into buying. 
---
I‚Äôll absolutely stay mad, you and many people like you have poor standards of quality for things you pay $100 dollars for. And because of that everyone else suffers. 
---
‚ÄúHey I like this shiny turd! $100 here go Game Company.‚Äù -You and your team.
---
except the slippery slope ain't a fallacy. shortsighted people often assume it is, but it isn't.
---
You didn't give your items away before leaving, that sux
---
When Internet Historian can meme you for a solid 28 minutes and youtube channels (looking at you laymen gaming) can get ~~weeks~~ months of content off of yet another fuck up I think fallout 76 is the gift that keeps on giving.
---
Anthem is just dying quietly in the corner. Fallout 76 is the raging dumpster fire that people are just standing back waiting for it to eventually burn itself out.
---
I always listen to the classical radio, some of those songs crack me up when im alone in the wasteland
---
Oh look. A loser in its natural habitat.
---
Even legendaries? I can't find a definitive answer.
---
This. This is exactly what they‚Äôve done for YEARS. What made me sick was when 76 launched and one of the top streamers at the time flat out stated ‚Äúhating this game gets way more views‚Äù.
---
Shit like this causes real problems to get buried under noise.
---
I think bethesda might have shit on themselves
---
I've realized I don't actually like Bethesda games, I just like Bethesda *worlds*. One day, if 76 gets actual mods and proper private servers (even with a reasonable monthly fee tied solely to hosting such a server), this too might be awesome. 
---
In spite of Bethesda, rather than because of them. As always.
---
First...? Hahaha
---
Are u so naive or do just act like it?
---
Lucky hole has crystal too, not as much though
---
And all of that runs at 15$ a month. The only difference in the two games is the amount of ferals.
---
And then insurance for said housing and vehicles like from MGSV
---
There‚Äôs a sucker born every second.
---
It is not exactly that Bethesda is trying to make money, it is that they are trying to generate value, almost certainly under orders from ZeniMax, which is almost certainly under pressure from Providence Equity, which owns a 25% stake in ZeniMax and has been trying to recover from the 2.3 billion dollars in value their other 2007 investments cost them in 2015... right around when ZeniMax and Bethesda Softworks (not Bethesda Game Studios) really started pushing Creation Club and other approaches to monetization.
---
[https://youtu.be/C\_RSc7-u19s](https://youtu.be/C_RSc7-u19s)
---
&gt;All evidence points to them lying about the inability to integrate it without technical issues
---
List it. What evidence?  If it's just a Redditor saying "Im a programmer guys, Bethesda is lying.  Trust me" you got hoodwinked.
---
Other online games have this exact same issue
---
of course it will. it'll be tied to the official creation club however, and nothing else will be allowed other than Bethesda-sanctioned mods.
---
no big tatas for you. it's bad PR.
---
No, you‚Äôre allowed to have an opinion. No one said you weren‚Äôt but the fact remains that you‚Äôre not missing out on much, except maybe the ncr ranger armor if they don‚Äôt put it on the atom shop as well as the atoms, by not paying 100 dollars a year on this shit, which is, as i said before, completely voluntary.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt need fallout first as an excuse. I hear the game is getting excellent reviews and it‚Äôs from the developer that gave us the best fallout (fallout new Vegas). I‚Äôm personally waiting for it to come to switch but 76 fucking up or not I‚Äôm getting it.
---
I was so excited for this game but something told me to wait. Thank the Lord I did, I've read nothing but bad things and don't plan on getting it even though I love Falloit.
---
You're a fucking cancer to the gaming community... quit supporting shady buisness models, and unfinished games.
---
No, and i'm also not forced to act like every person is making a sensible and valid argument.
---
Half these posts are folks that are just jumping on the bandwagon, many have never even played the game or quit months ago. These repetitive posts do get old and do nothing but cloud up my feed.
---
Cease and Desist notices from actual teams of corporate lawyers can often get an ISP/hosting provider to shut something down pretty quickly.
---
Google and YouTube exists. You could also read the hundreds of posts about it on here instead.
---
Gets harder to justify, but there will always be people who love [beets](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=beets) while the majority hate them...
---
If you know you can kill it in one hit then use something else or at least give others a shot to make sure they can get something. Too easy but it sounds like you‚Äôve done it... 
---
It literally screws others over... numerous subs on this and those people don‚Äôt care and laugh... well have fun doing it alone... people like that is just one of the reasons for the demand of private servers but you don‚Äôt see that do you?
---
Just dont click on these posts man, I scroll by dozens of posts a day im not interested in. You claim to not be interested or "tired" of these kinds of posts so just do what any normal person would do and keep scrolling and don't waste your time on replying/reading. They bought the game and the devs did something that people aren't happy with so they come to reddit and voice their concerns/opinions. I see posts of people defending being lied to and scammed but I don't click their post and tell them to stop posting it because I don't want to see it I just ever so simply **continue scrolling**..
---
They fixed it too good if you ask me, legendary goo piles disappear when enemies spawn... Anyone else have issues with this too?
---
Theyd register the domain becsuse its the fucking name of their packaged crate of sbq shit.
---
Ight thanks mate
---
what do you mean it's not infinite? there's a hard limit?
---
Naive, no I don't believe I'm naive. If sticking to what I feel is right, is naive then I genuinely don't want to be anything else. I'd rather stick to my morals then die on a hill that I don't stand for.
---
So you ignored everyone else's post and went straight for the negative one.
---
Right.
---
Same here. Uninstalled today on Xbox and did initial install for Outer Worlds right after. Damn disappointing from Bethesda.
---
Soviet Russia was responsible for the inspiration of some of the greatest literary works of art of all time, because communism lead to such authoritarian persecution and suffering that the books exposing what they did caused the complete collapse of French communism- there was no longer any moral high ground for French communism to stand on.
---
Meh. Dont care. Still money well spent.
---
Why would fallout 76 decide whether you play other games. Sorry to break it to you but I‚Äôm pretty sure the content that would have been released for the rest of the year most likely could be beaten in a day or two
---
Yes everything in private servers is available to you in public ones as well. They‚Äôre basically the same thing other than you can invite friends to them and take over workshops with risk of pvp
---
Yes I did but your short attention span made you miss my comment, sad :(
---
If you finally clean your room maybe your mom will buy it for you.
---
ha, indeed
---
Unless they iron out all the bugs, make it cheaper, and make it a one-off payment, I wouldn't even think about it. There's also the question of whether their servers will even last beyond a year at this rate.
---
Best would be if it was like Minecraft where you have the ability to host your own server rather than being stuck on Bethesda's servers, and being able to use your own custom plugins/mods. I'm doubting whether Bethesda has the capability to do that even if they wanted to at this point though.
---
The very fucking fact that they did this on Great War day... pisses me off even more. My friends and I have celebrated that day (with a call to senators for denuclearization and cake) since before Fallout 3 was even announced. I‚Äôve been really happy that Fallout has reached a larger audience with the newer games unlike some *other* long-time fans but this is bananas! I really believe that Todd Howard used to be one of the good guys. However money and fame corrupt and he seems to have internalized the hype about himself aka ‚ÄúGod Howard‚Äù and all that. He‚Äôs one of ‚Äúthe suits‚Äù now in all but attire, and that‚Äôs truly sad.
---
And in Ark, you can log into the server's Discord to get an admin to fix a glitch, etc.   
---
FO76? ...
---
If it was just in the Atom shop separately it would probably be more expensive...it was going to be locked behind a paywall anyway, how did you think otherwise?
---
There's already a huge selection of mods for this game
---
No. Happened to me on Xbox. And no as bethesda clamied its not just. Visual bug
---
Imo yea. We refused to cave and buy atoms, and this is what we get. Just give me server code for $100 and I'll host my own offline world and I'd be happy.
---
Same dev team. Same publishers. Same basic disregard. You have anymore stupid questions or am I free to go?
---
Delete the old EXE's (should have a date stamp from September, copy, paste and rename from the newly downloaded Fallout76.exe
---
Wow.  You‚Äôve swayed me with your wild tongue.  Touch√©. Your white knighting has put me in check. Please continue.
---
Half them? Probably, but even so the other half still have genuine issues, and they want the world to hear what they have to say.
---
I mean you didn‚Äôt really answer it
---
There was a reason I used to be happy giving WoW my $15 a month.  They listened to constructive feedback, built an endgame, had tons of incremental short term content, and followed through on their promises.  For me, no matter how much I do/don‚Äôt enjoy this game, supporting a group of liars just isn‚Äôt in the cards.  The success of this cash grab would set a terrible precedent.
---
That's not mod support its a sanctiond sandpit. I can go to nexus and download stuff that fundamentally changes the systems in fo4 and that will never be allowed in fo76. The CC are not mods it is DLC.
---
Wait I‚Äôm
---
Confused then where was said dildo originally supposed to be? And at what point did the plan go so awry that we ended up here?
---
Tbf, it was one of the first. Also I've been away all day
---
I hear stockholm is beautiful this time of the year.

#  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it‚Äôs all free after launch ‚Äì all our content, there‚Äôs no season pass and no paid DLCs."  -Pete Hines

You seem pretty butthurt.
---
It frees up 80% of my storage. I have about 200-250 lbs for sale/stored clothes and items. The rest is matts. I actively sell bundles to the robots and build large structures for a hobby. Putting an infinite amount into a bin is very game changing. With the deployable tent you can literally loot an entire zone and walk 3 feet to drop the tent and store it without worry of limit. Rather then doing a loop around whitesprings..selling and calling it a day. I can get a lifetimes worth of matts in one night instead of struggling day to day. This of course also changes vending as well. Because instead of storing your limit and ignoring the overflow id now have 80% more inventory to mass store bullets and aid items and now can even consider putting up weapons that dont sell instantly. Giving me a higher rate of income over the person who is trying to manage it on a 1k balance. The rest is petty cosmetics for now but if they add sub only buildables and other future items it will bring will only make the wound fester ontop of the damage its caused.
---
I mean I personally really enjoyed hearthfire for $4.99...... now since then.......
---
I played the beta, was fairly excited. Pre-ordered and everything. I played for a couple of months, then quit. I'm really looking forward to Outer Worlds though.
---
This is a completely voluntary thing. You‚Äôre not being punished whatsoever. Stop being an overdramatic baby.
---
Edit: i swear to god, you people get triggered over the stupidest shit every fucking day.
---
Oh my god you are just so wrong
---
I hate it so much that the ranger armor is locked behind the sub service, I fucking love the ranger armor and made my own cosplay of it, but I'm not gonna cave and buy this shitty ass service

I‚Äôve actually gotten back into Overwatch lately. I know there‚Äôs a lot of drama with Blizz rn but I‚Äôm really liking role queue in it and it‚Äôs the Halloween event too.

Thanks for the suggestions though. Outer Wilds is definitely on my radar.

Again, it's Fallout 1st

1st. not First

---
Providence Equity happened.
---
They invested in ZeniMax in 2007 and acquired a 25% minority stake in ZeniMax.
---
In 2015, many of their 2007 investments went bankrupt or fell apart and cost Providence something close to 2.3 billion dollars USD in value.
---
2015 was when they started 'investigating options' with regard to ZeniMax and their other remaining 2007 investments. One option was to push ZeniMax to become a public traded company, which thus far has been something ZeniMax has avoided.
---
Since 2015, ZeniMax companies have been trying out numerous approaches to monetization in order to generate value for Providence and themselves, not to mention acquiring lesser studios in order to grow their own holdings and increase their value. Yes, to make money, for sure! But also, almost certainly, to avoid being pressured into becoming a publicly traded c ompany that then has to deal with shareholders by increasing their estimated value.
---
Here is Providence's own video about ZeniMax:
---
It is not about money near so much as it is about value.
---
Yes, that's what Bethesda said!
---
yeah, and that's exactly the same logic being applied here, regarding """**private**""" servers.
---
they're not private servers. it's just PR speak for "premium subscription model". same is gonna happen with mods.
---
You‚Äôre right.  Like my fellow bro.  I felt the need to run my mouth.  Lesson learned.
---
They said they wanted to increase it in time. The bigger one for me is if public workshops save what you build, which they also mentioned. I‚Äôd be stoked to have every place built to my liking.
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
That's fine, the issues should be talked about. This post brought nothing to the conversation
---
The juicy lies of a company that is owned by many money hungry investors. They really made a deal with the devil back then to save them from going bankrupt, huh?
---
I'm not trying to, if anything I don't like being called what I'm not. If you don't have anything else to say on this matter, then lets just leave it like two respectable adults. To call names is nothing but childish.
---
I hope they close the game down and 2 years from now release Fallout 76: A Wasteland Reborn.
---
How does that boot taste?
---
I could actually see a world where this happens. They'd call it a "reset" to address legacies, dupers, etc, and thank you for participating in the extended B.E.T.A.
---
It was heavily community requested after all.
---
Almost all UI and Map mods. Nothing that changes gameplay.

Nobody gives a fuck that your post was deleted. Get over it.

So what‚Äôs the limit then? It says ‚Äúnearly infinite‚Äù
---
The point is they charged you for the dildo, then shoved it up the wrong hole without lube, pointed the wrong direction.
---
Talk about fucked!
---
This is what i came in here to make sure has been said.
---
ESO+ is *literally* unlocking the vast majority of the new content. You are paying $15 for **years of content**. And if youre like me and managed to clear nearly all the DLC content in a month (from playing 4-6 hours a night minimum), its some of the best time/money you can spend on the market. *While still getting a lump sum of "Crowns"*.
---
For Fo76, you're just paying $12+ for features that should be in the base game, and none of the unique content that has come out. They're not even fresh/unique servers, they're just random ones *people have already looted and arent persistent.* Its $12+ a month for a *basic feature of PC games*, but worse.
---
Your the customer, you can have the power if you tell them you won‚Äôt buy it until you get what you want, because if enough say ‚Äúadd this and I‚Äôll buy it‚Äù they‚Äôll do it, because money talks
---
10k each rec probably LOL, this is bethesda.
---
That's fair, so I'll just leave it here.
---
Yes. Because their excuses are bullshit.
---
There's a single crystal deposit near the mad hatter tea party unmarked location EDIT: just noticed you seem to be looking for large amounts I don't know of any large deposits I'm afraid
---
If the game is 64 bit the max amount it could possibly have is 18,446,744,073,709,551,616
---
Next month they'll put another set of cosmetics that you'll really want, and then another...and you'll keep buying subs for one more...just one more. This is the last month, you'll swear as you click purchase.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm out of the loop a bit so this is a serious question, how is having a private server p2w? What advantages does that give over the rest of the player base since there‚Äôs no explicit pvp mode? Not defending Bethesda but it seems like it‚Äôs just a way to play single player or with only friends rather than say, buying a gun in call of duty for 10 bucks that‚Äôs stronger than every other gun.
---
it just says "nearly infinite", that's not a number.
---
here's hoping it only applies to people with millions of units of junk, and not that they're going back on what was advertised.
---
Workshops to me are a waste of time. In the same amount of time say an hour I could literally farm twice as much raw material and xp that an hour uninterrupted in a workshop. 
---
I haven‚Äôt been griefed... many have been and I only said that as a reason why many opted for private servers. 
---
I do blame Bethesda for not making Pacifist actually in damaging... if they did that griefers would have nothing. But now they throw nuke mines... even trolling low levels... not exactly PvP at all, kinda weak IMO...
---
Welcome to the paywall.   
---
Also, why Fallout is a SINGLE PLAYER SERIES and not an MMO.
---
Glassed caverns has a few. Also the mine at the load bearing quest has bits of everything.
---
Lake side cabins near Charleston has a good layout with silver and crystal. Prob your best bet.
---
He‚Äôs no Steve Jobs.

Free to play suggests no initial cost, ESO was 60$ at launch. It falls under the freemuim category in my opinion, the base game is just a taste, but you want to be dark brotherhood, thats 10$. Want to join the thieves guild, thats 10$. How about morrowind, you want to go there, thats 40$. Elsweyr is also 50$. Basically the base game was a few questlines for 60$ and everything else is considered extra. Which is not the way a game should be made or marketed.
---
That'd be nice. But it took 1 year to add in private servers.   
---
Don't expect any advanced controls or a better system any time soon is what I'm saying here.
---
are you happy yet??? did anyone ask for you to fuck us harder todd?
---
But what about ESO? It wasn't great at first, but after a year or so of mediocrity the Board decided to invest heavily to fix the game, which resulted in Tamriel United. Since then ESO has had a much bigger fanbase. Why can't Bethesda do that with FO76?
---
Even better: have the heads of id Software do it and call the nuke itself "Keen's Revenge."
---
I didn't buy anything tho is the thing. They haven't taken my money since I refunded and cancelled my sub. Boom baby
---
But, this is Bethesda.
---
I notice some sad pathetic scumbag, is down liking my comments for no reason, but has no balls to speak out, obvious troll is obvious you should hit they  &lt; only aimed at who voted
---
regardless of your personal take on it though, people are already abusing it and have several thousand pounds of junk and ammo. you can't deny that's p2w as it's not possible without a subscription.
---
He has not done a single thing to the game since launch. Sure he still is the head and face but he isn't personally overlooking 76
---
Similar to eso. They have some good mods but you are correct. People are naive if they think they are going to just mod in new creatures and guns.
---
I dont think its going to last till q1. Private servers are not as fun as you'd think. Im bored after a day.
---
The scrap box issue is not just a visual one I tried a work bench repairs and even building in camp I lost it all 3 to 5k of every thing over 5k in weight.
---
Not everyone is a child spending someone else‚Äôs money. Some people make money, save money and spend that money on their hobbies. That‚Äôs what the fuck this logic is.
---
If this is the case, anybody subscribing to private servers will drop it, pretty much killing the game once and for all. I for one hope you‚Äôre wrong...but that‚Äôs why I chose the monthly and not the entire year. I‚Äôm giving it till Wastelanders is released.
---
That's the thing about conspiracy theories. Sometimes there ***is*** a conspiracy and by the time it's no longer a theory you are already too late to do anything about it.
---
I don‚Äôt it just seems like something that is a minor inconvenience... like in wow if someone last hit the mob for your quest. It sucks but it happens, intentionally or not. But that‚Äôs just my opinion. + most the good shit you get is trash all the good stuff comes from trading in my experience.
---
Damn, balls first and everything

I think they use the hero engine so they did one better and paid someone else to worry about the engine

Oh, hey, I see you, Chinese Blizzard. Get out.

People who throw money at Bethesda for this crap excuse of a game deserve all the bad things they get from it. All self inflicted.

You people, is that people who have played this game &amp; enjoy it. 
---
Or is it another you people = you know the ones who played for five minutes or have never played &amp; just want to jump on the hate train.
---
I guess at least you have actually played the game, unlike a lot of the posters yesterday just putting out total crap &amp; have never even owned the game.
---
You have your reason for not buying it, that's up to you. I had my own reasons to buy it. If this means that only people left playing, enjoy it and aren't there to just be annoying, then yesterday was the best day of this game &amp; it's only going to get better.
---
Totally agree, strangers make the game more interesting and we can already play with friends on public servers. Bethesda is just offering a non solution pretty much
---
Care to elaborate beyond an emotional response?
---
Jesus fucking Christ... people act like nobody has legitimate reasons to complain about this. 
---
They came up with the monetization scheme for the game and repeatedly used it in PR to boast about how great they were for not doing all that bad stuff other companies were doing. Nobody held a gun to their head to force them to only sell cosmetics. They could have used a monthly subscription like an MMO, they could have had paid expansions like Conan Exiles or Destiny, they could have tied the new content to the in-game currency like with GTA Online or RDRO, they could have done a lot of things.
---
Now, roughly a year later, it has all fallen apart. Turns out nobody wants to buy a bunch of cosmetics for a game that was shit on release and hasn't had any meaningful content added in nearly a year besides a battle royale mode nobody asked for. 
---
Now they're attempting to switch to a premium monthly subscription model under the guise of introducing public servers. It's almost copy/pasted directly from ESO, down to the unlimited storage for crafting mats. 
---
It is fine that their experiment failed spectacularly and they need to switch things up. It's not fine that they have to bullshit us while they slowly tiptoe their way to a more sustainable business model, but that is on the consumer to decide if they are okay with that.
---
I paid 13$ lmao. Where's your evidence of your accusations though? Or you just gonna throw out some more bullshit with no evidence?
---
Yeah I don't like reactionary dickheads who speak on matters with no knowledge of what they're talking about so I don't think it'd work anyways sorry babe :(
---
This is a thing...Lol That is awesome. Great sub. I know ignorance of the law is no excuse but I will try and do better...lol though I don't think it hardly qualifies as emoji spam, but it is noted. If I can get the actual law or ordinance information I will be sure to pass it along to my rowdy emoji friends. ;)
---
Yes, it absolutely will. All the bad press, they‚Äôll probably respond with discounting it and *maybe* offering atom compensation for the dipshits that bought in
---
I end up spending a lot of time trying to manage my stash to keep it under the limit. I have to use up a lot of plastic to keep my junk bulked to keep the weight down. Unlimited junk storage would save me time managing my stash and I could have way more fun with energy weapons that use plastic to make ammo for. Would they have had to monetize this feature if they were making enough money in the atomic shop by charging prices way more people would be willing to pay?
---
Thank you!
---
Underrated comment right here.
---
I pre-ordered. I tried to play, I gave up. I haven't launched the Bethesda launch since a month or so after launch, except today to directly uninstall FO76.
---
I unsubscribed from this sub then and haven't been back since, until I saw an Imgur post today talking about their "new patch and features", which made me curious and come in here.
---
This is the simple truth, people like me just silently leave, meaning you are left with the active people left being the ones who will defend it no matter what, once someone becomes so invested in something, they have to defend it because any other option is admitting error or fault.
---
You're talking to someone who saw the mtx industry trending where it is since before the horse armor.
---
Also slippery slope is literally a logical fallacy by definition.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope
---
Well maybe that's the problem then. He's just letting them fuck with the game with no proper management. And he's earning money for it, wonderful
---
Very beautitul, its never not been beautiful. I mean sometimes i can kind of ruin the scenery, but thats my fault!
---
If you enjoy the game, simply play it like you have been and ignore all the BS
---
Lol I found that in the beta and haven't seem it since. But yeah I'm trying to find a bunch. I want more cryo ammo
---
I know they are making money there. But if they dropped the prices would they have been making enough off the store that they didn't have to monetize all the new fallout 1st stuff?
---
If you go back to the early days of the term P2W it was directly tied to golden ammo and the term P2W quickly overtook p2p and was the successor of it. Thus any advantage in a F2P became P2W and since the origin of the term was directly related to F2P games what I had written would be objectively correct.
---
Yes, yes they probably would monetize it. They need some way to keep the servers running. Do you people not realize that? I mean this isn‚Äôt like any of the other games where it didn‚Äôt matter in the first place. Here they actively need money to continue running the servers and fund the next game, otherwise they would cut their losses and shut the whole game down and no one would be able to play it.
---
The whales that buy this shit are the reason you‚Äôre still able to play the game.
---
consider the following two things: one, the ranger outfit. most people would gladly pay 10 bucks for the most popular outfit the Fallout universe bar PA.
---
and two, most people who are dissatisfied with the news probably won't be playing 76 right now. specially with Outer Worlds getting released.
---
let's see how they fare next month, once the sub expires and people have no real reason to renew it.
---
Also I always assumed everyone ran the hardest hitting build they could by that logic they had the same opportunity to one shit the mob as I
---
Spot on.   
---
The rather large delay on Wastelanders shows that someone did the math and realized that while it would make current players happy as hell, it wouldn't bring in new revenue via new players. So it probably got bumped back for a subscription system that might bring in revenue from existing players. 
---
I still think this last year and the promises made about Wastelanders was big Bethesda's attempt at preventing them from getting sued for this garbage fire like Gearbox did for Colonial Marines.
---
If you run a backup, you can restore it and uninstall it again and again, just to keep sending the message.
---
You missed the part where a lot of people said they are not playing anymore. Which I suspect thats the case. In my case, I rented one for a month for the content but beyond that Im going to go to outer worlds and stop playing fallout 76. Im bored after 5 hours of a private server, theres no way in hell I can be entertained for a couple of days
---
Lol dude subscription based mmos dont even get 2 content drops a month...wtf

‚ÄúIt also turns out that the worlds are not being created new but are instead recycled instances that have already been used for the normal version of the game, so some are full of dead enemies or have long ago been looted of anything useful.‚Äù

I‚Äôm literally named Vault Dweller. I‚Äôve been playing this game series since Fallout 1. I have more knowledge on this subject and IP than you do.

Any questions?

I noticed better drops more leganderies more frequent events and better stability
---
I think them including Atoms in the sub kinda proves that they are fine concerning atom shop...I think it‚Äôs just for server support. I say that playing on a private server right now all to myself, farming the hell out of Legendaries. Lol
---
I am pretty sure it is Zenimax that is pushing this shit onto them. It would definitely explain the shit timing and more aggressive microtransactions
---
Autocorrect is a fickle master.
---
No they are not cosmetic items but they are not necessary to play the game as is. Also since you are going to be throwing out diagnoses, as a Neurologist, how do you view the current situation with Fallout 76 causing redditors to follow their dreams of finally becoming licensed medical professionals and diagnosing people for free?
---
Already uninstalled - it's clear this game has no chance of getting better, unless I let them rape my wallet. No more preordering Bethesda games either -- taking a wait n see approach to them now.
---
Wait, I was wondering about this. Can you explain it a little more in depth for the process. So you get a month? Subscription. Collect the rewards. Then how to refund. Do you need pay anything at all, like it didn't take money from your account straight away? Or it only takes as the month finishes? What platform are you on?
---
It can't be open world.  The game takes place on multiple planets.
---
People keep criticizing the game for not being open world, and I don't get it.  Do people want to fly through empty space?
---
My issue honestly lies with the company. I wish that people could like this game without supporting these shady business practices. The problem lies in that by playing the game it's giving them a pass to lie to players faces, and continue to put gameplay features behind a paywall. "Give them an inch and they'll take a yard."
---
Thanks for your response. So far it's been minor conveniences and hamstrung functionality. A 15 slot fridge with worse refrigeration than backpacks or perks that you can't sell in your player shop.
---
I'm on board against this when they start selling things that let you skip levels, or weapons that are at least on par with or unique legendary stats in the shop.
---
But even if I store a bunch of scrap, I still had to take the time to gather it all
---
I bought the refrigerator and literally have never used it. It‚Äôs not very functional for herbivore players who can have food at their leisure.
---
So when is the Atomic Shop going to be patched out?
---
Coming soon to the Atom Shop. Exclusively for FO 1st Subscribers!
---
Yeah a year after launch is long enough for at least a stable base game.
---
ps4 - 1/80 person other than myself on my friends list online at prime time
---
I took 76 off my list,
---
You also need to unsubscribe from all of the related Subreddits.
---
(Not really, but it sure would make it a helluva lot easier finding posts with actual content.)
---
I'm on board with TES VI but I sure as hell won't be pre-ordering it. Unless they do this shit again, I'll probably enjoy TES VI. But I will be cautious.   
---
But fuck Starfield. I don't know what it is and at this point I don't trust it. I'll be waiting until well after launch and after the REAL reviews come out before I even consider buying it.   
---
I'm saying that if JIM STERLING doesn't love Starfield, then to hell with that game.
---
This is absolutely the case
---
I wouldn't trust anything on wikipedia regarding right-wing topics and general slang. the frankfurt school also mysteriously became a conspiracy theory overnight.
---
Fair enough I see your point
---
You're lacking code of conducts and empathy. Yes I also have fun and have been a bethesda fan up until this point. Yes the game is fun, IF its the only game you play.
---
I also see quite a few new players emerging from V76. I‚Äôve been curious if they are really new players or existing players starting new profiles, and sometimes they are the latter. But often they are brand new players emerging for the first time, at least judging from their Xbox profiles having no F76 Achievements yet.  Whiners saying the game is dead are, well, I‚Äôm not going to say what they are.
---
I'd personally rank it third. Ranking for me is 4, NV, 76.
---
ask for a puppy get a puppy skin hat
---
Yea it sucks
---
Where was your camp at?
---
A month? Or a year?
---
Though 76 is the most fun in a Fallout game I've ever had.
---
I always wondered how many of the white knight Fallout 76 defenders here on reddit and on the official forums were really just Bethesda employees on private accounts.
---
They don't even hire real programmers. I worked in north Austin at the same campus when I was at CreditCards.com, I saw their people at the same food trucks. Wearing Bethesda tees and letting it all hang out, mostly Tumblrinas thinking they were contributing to gaming lore by reproducing their Girl Scout diaries.
---
God what a shit-show.
---
I dont know where you are from but this it was quiet obviously misleading marketing meant to take your money and then once they did they reversed on their word.
---
Most of the people hating on fallout don't even play. They lurk around online just waiting to go on some ignorant rant.
---
"haha look at me I'm enjoying myself and definitely not coming into random threads to be contrarian to waste my own time"
---
Well, this thread aged poorly
---
Downvotes commencing 3, 2, 1...
---
I appreciate your willingness to admit you were wrong, friend. No hard feelings at all. Just remember this when other companies do things they shouldn't! Even if it's not a "slippery slope" in all honesty, I still think something like the refrigerator is too much because the people who bought such a crap game (some did pay full price) should get that stuff added for free, but at least we know how disgusting Bethesda is willing to be! I'm not even buying their single player games after this.
---
I looked in to the outer worlds, it is not my cup of tea
---
It‚Äôs not the only game i play but I still enjoy it, this goes for a lot of people

---
They still haven't fixed bug issues from FO4 release.
---
Yeah just move to a different spot. Everything will be fixed and in your stores menu
---
I can't comment on NV because 4 was the first one I played. My unmodded FO4 on xbone crashes almost everytime I enter Downtown Boston or by the police station when the Danse is fighting the ghouls. I have a SSD and tried reinstalling. Only when I was able to use Nytra's fps mods was I able to move around those areas without constant crashes.
---
Thanks. How do you figure you can bypass actually process of collecting junk? You still have go around and collect it, and before the sub, I always had more junk than I knew what to do with. My main problem would be: how did they figure out how to make infinite scrap storage to work when you pay for it, and are subs literally renting a little server space for than infinite scrap? 
---
Perhaps their redemption story is in their delayed Wastelanders. We'll see? 
---
I think just playing the game tells them we're OK with their practices at this point. Subs keep it going in some form.
---
Fucked, I say!
---
That's an unexpected question. Uh, by playing both the games? 
---
You were talking about items on the ground. In F76 you can't drop items on ground. In F4 you could have serious trouble if the game tries to render thousands of dropped items on the ground.
---
Items in inventory and stash are just two numbers in memory, item type and item amount. And it doesn't matter at all if the amount is 1 or 1M.
---
Not shocked at all! Dupers have their own servers in peace...
---
Instead we see people laughing at a video saying how awesome it is seeing someone put nuke mines all over...
---
People wouldn‚Äôt be selling on eBay and Gameflip and making thousands of no one was buying but they‚Äôve sold millions of in game items! 
---
Dupers been duping all along and it‚Äôs been reported why servers have issues... guess what? 
---
Not a single issue on the private server I was in, no lag, it was smooth.
---
Like I said you are entitled to your own opinion and ability to uninstall the game, my point is, is that don‚Äôt take out your anger for bethesda on the part of the player base that still likes the game
---
But that already means you DO pass the slope, because the "slope" is different for different people. Whereas you may consider refrigerators "touting" the slope, some may consider it crossing the line. And neither are wrong, but you would be wrong to say anyone is wrong for thinking it's crossing the line.
---
Cry more then, reactive, inarticulate child.
---
Mine is just Fine
---
Ok, but honestly all of those paid features should have been obtainable through gameplay.
---
So, how many YouTube videos did you have to watch before you formed this opinion?
---
It will. Some studio will do something wrong. The YouTube crowd will make a video. The angry mob will move on to that reddit sub instead.
---
Rinse repeat.
---
I am just happy Bethesda came out into the open on their intentions with FO76.
---
People can now decide to take it or leave it. Everyone can then play what they like how they like and the world can move on to something else.
---
yup, been playing since the beta too.
---
Funny enough I actually got booted off my ‚Äúprivate‚Äù server yesterday. (Bought a month of 1st to see if it‚Äôs even kinda worth it)
---
Outer Worlds is out. If you‚Äôre like me and have Gamepass you‚Äôre playing that for free on either Xbox or pc.
---
It didn't end the way they wanted? But.... "It just works." 
---
XD
---
&amp; that's a reasonable reason, but when you put out you people etc. It sets the wrong tone. 
---
We just play a game cause we like it, we didn't steal your girlfriend, wife, job or dog as you would think from some of yesterday's crap.
---
I personally have nil issues with what has occurred, it's just a game.
---
They should have, but it‚Äôs no reason to take out your anger for Bethesda on the playerbase that enjoys the game
---
Uh, what? Logical fallacies having nothing to do with politics and slippery slope has been established as a logical fallacy long before either of us were born.
---
it's not dupers. people can amass infinite junk and ammo "legally" in private worlds.
---
and I don't believe for a second dupers had such a massive impact on server performance and neither should you, partially because Bethesda is known to lie, and partially because the servers are just as bad with or without active exploits.
---
I haven't played FO76 in several months. This has done nothing to bring me back. In fact, it pretty much ensures I won't be back.
---
It's sad because I was one of those who actually enjoyed 76, warts and all, and I feel I got my money's worth with the base game. I don't feel like I'd get it with a sub.
---
Bless you. Keep playing what you like you magnificent bastard!
---
Yeah, these ‚Äúprivate servers‚Äù are bullshit. I don‚Äôt have to pay extra for private servers in Grand Theft Auto V or Minecraft.
---
Did you have an orgasm while writing this drivel or something.
---
Your satire is as well designed as Bethesda's code.
---
...oookay
---
I paid 14$ not $100.
---
Thanks baby
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a very common occurrence and to act like it isn‚Äôt is straight denial. Yes you have been disconnected in the past three months, stop lying to try and save face for Bethesda.
---
I am not a neurologist. I am a physicist and hence, intelligent enough to recognize stupid people, but I was giving you a benefit of doubt.
---
Forgive me if I misconstrue your meaning, but it sounds like you're defending Bethesda saying the subscription service is "3 centimeters" as in it's not that big a deal, when in actuality the Subscription service is more like a thousand miles. Sorry again if I didn't understand correctly, though.
---
So basically you don‚Äôt care what others think and will take the kill even though you know you can one shot kill them... 
---
If you think that way never wonder why no one cares about your opinion... you could at least give people a chance to tag it but you know only said screw em‚Äô... 
---
Again just one of the many points why there are private servers... people like you.
---
I agree.
---
Probably gonna be rented out for money.
---
I know this may be hard to believe, but no one cares about you, or your opinions. I'm surprised you even have friends to remove with an attitude like that.
---
Year
---
How stupid do you have to be to realize its the same thing? If they were smart, theyd take both domains and make them redirects. Instead, both domains lead to the same shitpost site.
---
The Forbes article was wrong and the media hack who wrote it did about 5 minutes of googling, it‚Äôs a new instance you create when doing it but the same rules apply to your character that always did. If you‚Äôve looted an area recently on a public instance it will still be looted in the private instance until it resets, just like always the loot refresh rate doesn‚Äôt change. the dead bodies are from enemies killing each other just like they‚Äôve always done. Someone saw some dead ghouls the robots at white springs killed for example and jumped on the salt train.....It‚Äôs not a private server though, it‚Äôs a private world/instance and there is a big difference between those two things and Bethesda should have done a better job explaining that.
---
On a low level legendary? Where‚Äôs the challenge?
---
üòÅüòÅüòÅüëçüëçüëç

That's disgusting.  Do they really do that!?
---
Nothing happened to Bethesda. This is what they've always been. Greed matched only by their lack of respect for the players, consistently releasing the most broken games in the industry with some of the worst post-launch support.
---
"Cancellation will be effective at the end of your then-current membership term." Are you sure you wont be just charged at the end of the month. Is there a choice to refund, or did you only cancel?
---
The halloween event is taking place in that area, it sounded like the trick-or-treat part of it will be in the locked rooms
---
you're reading too deep into it. there used to be a time when people didn't take every PR statement a company made at face value, and instead just dismissed it for what it really was: PR bs. I miss those times. I wonder what turned people so naive.
---
Like I don‚Äôt even get really that mad when I disconnect, I‚Äôve been lucky and it really hasn‚Äôt been at any important moments for me. More of a minor inconvenience. But man I feel
---
Bad for some of the people I have heard about disconnecting during the end of the raid and shit not being able to pick up where they left off
---
It's more of a lateral move by them is what I mean.
---
Adding gambling boxes and being able to buy powerful legendaries would be taking a mile imo
---
Cool, I literally did it anyway just because I'm fed up and don't want to bother coming back. Waste of space on my SSD.
---
You‚Äôre fucking dumb if you think someone can just manifest a new job because they don‚Äôt like their old one. The real world is tough and unfair, understand that

None of these as the jackets brown not green
---
Pay them $50 a month they'll fix it.
---
im guessing most ppl that said they were done with the game, were actually done with the game. 
---
amazing results when ppl actually follow through right?
---
The majority of problems people are stating on this sub, are issues with Bethesda. Play the game if you want. It just sets standards that I can't stand by.
---
Hey you're role playing! Almost like what people could be doing in FO76 but cant fathom it
---
Yes but 15$ for a half baked private server that anyone can join?
---
Wow very emotional
---
Understandable, doesn't make it any less pay to win though, the explanation of pay to win, as I understand it, is someone that's paying money on the game is going to have a different experience.
---
It may not be that the things they are selling aren't worth it, but that people are noticing a pattern developing and it's the principle of it that is upsetting, it feels like we put our trust in Bethesda despite the many bugs and the press releases then this stuff happens with the in-store content and it feels like we've been betrayed. 
---
The way that I see it, is that this is the beginning and it's going to get worse over time.
---
I was about to say that's why servers are empty. I mean that's why I'm not playing tonight. 
---
People either aren't logged in because they're playing the outer worlds or because they just got fed up with it and threw in the towel.
---
Yeah, well I just uninstalled. I just have no words anymore. I can't defend this game. I tried to tell people it's fun, blah blah blah. This was literally the final straw for me. I feel that this time, the hole is far too deep and wide. I'm done. It was fun while it lasted everyone. I'll miss you.
---
Well, it looks that way only because you had said they were addressing things players didn't want, and then cited NW and Survival as examples. I still play Adventure mode a bit, but at level 193 there's not much for me to do anymore but perform  maintenance, farm legendaries, make ammunition, and complete daily/weekly challenges. I play NW for a break from the monotony, but even so, I'd likely continue playing even with more Adventure mode content, for variety.
---
Think 80 or 90
---
I went from an everyday player of 76 to uninstalling the game due to this new update with $13 a month.
---
At least I got more space for acutal good games!
---
No offense to anyone but Bethesda, but I don't feel bad for a single person who bought that Subscription Service and isn't pleased. It's completely their fault, though no offense to them, they just need to research things far better before buying, but if they only did the month thing thankfully it's just $13 they lost and can cancel right away, but anyone who bought the year subscription? Yeah, I feel nothing bad for them if they're not pleased.
---
They could have had something that would have rivalled DayZ in terms of Post Apocalyptic RolePlay.  
---
But the fact that these servers are basically Minecraft Realms and no dedicated support for Stand alone boxes or servers...
---
it boggles my mind why Bethesda thinks this method of modding and management is effective.
---
Then i remembered.  
---
Microtransactions, what could possibly go wrong. We fucked up? Just put Todd on stage next E3 and have him go "DID WE DO THAAAT?"
---
I can typically get back in to the world I was in by joining a recent player, not a huge deal for sure but definitely a common occurrence.
---
A relevant third thing
---
If you're on ps4, i can add you and let you see it.
---
It‚Äôs been going on everywhere on reddit recently, not just this sub. The nanny police are out in full force removing anything that could upset anybody. Welcome to current year.
---
For sure more common then it should be
---
Exactly. I'm sure a lot of existing players have paid up, I have because I usually buy an interesting outfit+atoms bundle anyway amongst other appeals, but even as someone who did so it doesn't feel like a decision made based on a healthy game aiming to get even healthier.
---
The '1st' part is incredibly insulting all by itself with the implications. '1st to be catered to'. '1st Class Player' (and we consider every one else a free loader). '1st step towards further predatory decisions'. So many things that someone should have pointed out might be a bad idea, publicity wise even in a subliminal sense, yet no one did.
---
it is oftentimes the right who uses the term "slippery slope" to describe left-wing ideologies, politics and trends. kinda like how the OK hand became a hate symbol. it's guilt by association.
---
so it's unsurprising if a wikipedia article is biased.
---
So because you played beta &amp; have a copy that you've never played you think your opinion matters?
---
Go hate somewhere else
---
The crazy up in a tree place with all the cave crickets and the lovecraft face
---
I mean... isn't the point of Reddit for people to voice and discuss their opinions? You're going to hear the popular opinions a lot.
---
Sure, I can understand that.
---
Let's remember that they're not "free", they're stock/standard/core.
---
Stacks of TSE weapons and junk and plans and everything has a huge impact on ever single facet of the game. 
---
Think all those players with the massively duped BOS 3* combat armor with TSE‚Äôs earned them? Nope! 
---
They took them right into survival as well and PvP‚Äôers even complained. 
---
But wait, you want to blame Bethesda? Only thing in that case is not banning more people who violate the game, that ruins it for everyone.
---
Creation Club is a joke. It is so easy to get the mods without paying a cent, it makes you wonder why they even developed it... but I guess this is yet another Bethesda thing we will never understand.
---
Turn off your computer and make sure it powers down
---
Drop it in a forty-three-foot hole in the ground
---
Bury it completely; rocks and boulders should be fine
---
Then burn all the clothes you may have worn any time you were on-line!
---
That and everybody gets so many downvotes they probably just remove them. No opinions allowed
---
Well, there's voicing an opinion...
---
And then there's actively insulting whoever's against your opinion and basically trying to provoke a flame war. Which make up alot of threads.
---
If everyone did that do you think they care they gave you an outfit of pixels and 1700 atoms? Their own ingame currency........
---
They got your $12.00 already.  They won. Enjoy the outfit and atoms is what they will say.
---
In a few months they will have private only server events and then they'll get another round of signups.
---
No one is getting a true private server. What they are getting is a private game mode. Private server would mean that you can restart it if it gets laggy....load mods....leave it up for friends to join......any other admin function you would normally get for running your truly leased gaming server.
---
Anyway, everyone has been squalking about their decision. Simply play the game you paid $60 for and enjoy it or don't but don't think for a second that signing up and cancelling after a month is going to hurt this company.  Those "private " servers are already online. They are called worlds......having a 1st member join that tells the server to restrict incoming connections not made from a request from the 1st member is just a server command.
---
Lol...wow, I can feel the angst from here. Quite the assumption about me considering you don't know anything about me. I am not going to sit here and justify my post or myself to you. I am probably old enough to be your dad anyways.. lol......Have a good evening, see you in the wasteland. :)
---
Same bro. Feelsbadman.
---
Paging u/pitchforkemporium
---
I appreciate your intelligent analysis and unbiased view of the situation, though I would say those inclined to play it should have enough self-respect to not waste a ton of money for what they deserve in the game they already paid too much for, and if they paid at all for it, they paid too much. Though I do appreciate your insightful comment!
---
You forgot to finish your sentence.
---
Why do I find this adorable? Very clever idea:)
---
"we live in a world where a game company has to make money"
---
This used to occur when you paid 60 bucks for a game but that wasn't enough. Even if they cost 600 bucks it would not be enough, it is never enough.
---
Exactly. But apparently the point was too difficult to comprehend as I meant they didn't take down survival servers just so they could add paid.  Survival had a dead population and wasn't worth continuing as is to them. If survival was popular, they would've just added new hardware (nevermind that they're using cloud server hosting, but what are facts, right) to support both paid and survival.
---
Er, did you bother to read my post? I'm pointing out there was likely more than a hint of deperation in all their PR bull. Do I sound convinced by what they said? I'm hoping to spark a discussion on whether players feel the game has a future at this point, rather than anything they 'tried' to say.
---
Oh man, then I shouldnt tell you about the jalapenos....
---
sold
---
Preston needs help funding settlements, gotta pony up.
---
Don‚Äôt forget private servers as well.
---
Yeah but honestly On some of the more vocal Reddits it‚Äôs became at bit of a circle jerk. Just wish there was more civility rather than Bethesda shit sell the Ip and that jazz
---
On the contrary imagine if you're 60% the way through something you intended to sell to have the community have a similar idea?  
---
I think the main two problems is the raw cost and the "bundling" of these things with the subscription. I dont think it would of been as bad if they had also been available for Atoms.
---
I won‚Äôt respond to you suggestion of using FO 1st servers to test new builds of the game, however I will say that if Bethesda locks access to these test servers behind a pay wall, they will have another massive scandal on their hands.
---
I will however respond to your statement regarding generating revenue for future development. Please correct me if I am wrong but this was a full price release at launch, and has not yet gone free to play. The original proposition for the game was that you would pay for the full game up front then updates and DLC would be funded through Atomic Shop sales. That is where the original quote from Pete Hines, the VP of marketing and public relations came from. There is a similar statement fro Todd Howard, you should be able to find that for yourself.
---
You seem to blame the community for not supporting the Atomic Shop because they incorrectly feel the items are overvalued, but is this not the fault of the marketing team at Bethesda. They have repeatedly resold old assets and low effort recolors of base game items at premium prices. In a community with such an active modding scene players expect slightly more effort to be put into cosmetic items. And your claim that the community jumps to anger when any QOL item is added to the game is incorrect. The community is generally only upset when these items are added to the Atomic Shop. Bethesda assured players before launch that the Atom Shop would be cosmetic only, so you cannot say that outrage was not justified. Especially when many of them were community ideas and suggestions.
---
As for your claim that the membership fee is a good value, I cannot dispute that the Atoms rewarded monthly are of greater value than the cost, but that is not what is upsetting players. The fact that the use of private serves, the scrap box, and pop up camp is only available to members of the service is the reason people are speaking out. As the quote I originally posted, Pete Hines went on record saying that all future content for the game would be free. Practically every new gameplay mechanic this update was locked behind a premium price. Had this been strictly an Atomic Shop pass that provided a set number of atoms and sales monthly I don‚Äôt believe anyone would have an issue, but they chose to include gameplay effecting systems as well.
---
I‚Äôm not sure of your gaming history, but there have been many games even from recent memory that have relied on user machines to run private servers. This includes games like Minecraft and ARK: Survival Evolved. The game publisher does not have to do the heavy lifting for private servers, they can either give or sell access to the code so that players can run their own (I would consider selling rights to private servers justifiable because it is not part of the public build).
---
Overall, I don‚Äôt see very much reasoning as to why Bethesda was justified in breaking their word, just you shifting  blaming onto the player base for not supporting them more through micro transactions. If you have other reasons as to why Bethesda was justified in walking back their original statements, please share them.

You said you got your money's worth, so that's all that matters - keep enjoying gaming
---
I think its just cause its happening so fast. Mods here really dont take down much. The auto bot does and so do posters. So many of the Bethesda bad posts have been from week old accounts. Fairly certian it's just reddit lags and bad bots.
---
Lost all mine too. Least it's only junk but can not believe this game right now
---
Unpaid intern would either quit or take a swan dive after an hour
---
The only reason it's still on my xbox now is I have a couple friends who still plan on playing. I'll log on to divide up my stuff and move on. EA has some serious competition it seems
---
right, they didn't tell us about the second purchase of it digitally.
---
you're moving goal posts. I'm not arguing about fairness, mainly because it's a losing battle. I'm simply stating a fact: private worlds are p2w. why? because people can amass infinite junk and ammo. not that this was the original argument to being with.
---
oh, and also that, from a technical standpoint, I **doubt** dupers affected servers stability. at least not in any meaningful way.
---
Ur basically just being complacent with the shit sandwich Bethesdas feeding you. The game can be better and Bethesda are pumping out 1/10th baked content in order to make quick cash becuase of people with your view. Every single player who has stuck with this game deserves so much better at this point but Bethesda will not work on that becuase no matter how much of a fucking disgrace it is, people buy it. Why do you think long time players are leaving? Why the subscription service has such harsh backlash? Becuase this is beyond unacceptable. Yeah bethesdas a business, but without people to sell to then that buisness becomes redundant. It's a two way street and both sides have power to change things.
---
People say they are quitting this game every week and then take a day to calm down and keep playing it.
---
Or FROM SOFTWARE.
---
The day they go full steam ahead on corporate bullshit is probably the day I quit buying new games altogether.
---
Crybaby.
---
A non open world, budget rpg, in space? Lol sure you will
---
Hey, plenty of us were bringing it up when that happened, just people were like "oh that doesn't matter, it's just a minor convenience, it's practically nothing so quit bitching."
---
Eso is a gem.  It had a bad launch but it's been a hit since then
---
I fail to see where in your source that it gives actual evidence that it's true and not just an accusation. It says "players have discovered". What did they discover to prove it? Without evidence that's an ACCUSATION. Do you know the difference between the two? Do you believe everything you read on the internet? Or did you even read the source? "Some people said this so it's objectively true and this internet link has a title that backs me up" dude just stop lmao 
---
Don't try and flex your dick muscles about Fallout knowledge, I've played every single game, including tactics and bos, you're not winning any points there bb.  "I'm named after a Fallout character so I'm superior" god dude you're every bad stereotype of this community. Go look in a mirror my dude. Your appeal to authority ain't gonna work here
---
Im predicting now that the PTR is just gonna be a Fallout 1st Exclusive too that you can participate in if you have the membership.
---
Making bad business models and ignoring the community's input is stupid.
---
But that would involve admitting they got played, and didn't listen.
---
Better to just say everyone was wrong.
---
It is time to uninstall the game, and let their numbers drop. Maybe in 12 month come back, and see if it's any better. If not let this game die, and never look back. It's time to go to the outer rim, and kill some space stuff.
---
I didn't bother logging in at all. So there's that.
---
What free stuff?
---
Did you not get the memo is a subscription service you pay money for it  . . .
---
Also, corporations are not people therfore they do not need you to defend them it's not going to hurt the corporation's feelings. They are big boys and can deal with the fallout (hahahaha see what i did there)
---
‚ÄúFor an additional $6.99 a month you‚Äôll get your own room at the luxurious Whitesprings Golf course.‚Äù
---
The emote itself is griefing. The sound is so obnoxious and loud and it goes on for ages. Makes NW lobbies hell.
---
Who said you could ask why or have an opinion? I couldn‚Äôt, why should you. It just works. Also, just the mere mention of this gets downvoted to damnation due to the fallout clown posse!!! Heck, even I downvoted it because I hate my own comments, nobody listens to them!
---
that's it, shut it down, the secrets out!
---
 Never would've thought I'd get more entertainment from not buying this game. This game just keeps on giving.
---
More like, 16.99
---
What about changes in game balance. They did several things to mess with that that's paid only.
---
theres quite a few who never played the game at all who come here to bitch about a game they know nothing about except what the youtubers tell them.
---
People like me just played the game when we had fun with it and didn‚Äôt even think/ know that it was an issue? The majority of what I did while playing with Nuke cycling with a group of 4 amigos and just farming 3 stars while making fun of each other. I‚Äôm just saying I never thought of this as an issue since everyone and thing at the event was of appropriate level (at the time I‚Äôd say even over everyone was bout what 75-120 at the time) and chunking stuff on their own. If your build was bad and you lacked damage or just fire rate to get a hit in before the Mirelurk Queen took a round to the face isn‚Äôt that an personal issue? Sure it sucks but there‚Äôs like 16 more in the event ? See my POV. You lose some and you win some, no real  biggie.
---
Time grinding and repeating stuff like raids doesn‚Äôt count
---
So reduce that by at least 75% ;)
---
Besides 76 isn‚Äôt worth of the fallout name, it‚Äôs an MMO Lite shooter game and doesn‚Äôt stay true to the RPG of the previous fallouts
---
And to be honest with you I only paid for a month because I too have skepticisms however I'm not shouting them from the rooftops with no backing. I'd much rather judge it for myself. If I don't like them or the scandalous accusations of recycled servers are true I won't renew. Either way I'm only out 13$ ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It's Todd Howard's blessing.
---
Do the Mothman dance.
---
Fixed. It is shorter now. And more edgy
---
Unfortunately I don't think bethesda can do anything about this. Are you on xbox? If I have the materials I can drop by and put down a fusion generator and water pumps for you:)
---
This was my reaction as well. I paid and I‚Äôm enjoying it. Or I would be if I wasn‚Äôt at work right now.
---
IMO private servers was all about setting up a local server, setting my own rules and modding it.
---
I played the beta and knew the game was shit immediately and never bought it. I'm only here for the shitstorm this game stirs up.  Never would've thought I'd get more entertainment from not buying this game. This game just keeps on giving.
---
there wasn't. what they actually said was "we're lying to your faces with data you can't possibly verify because we're going back on our promise, which was bs in itself, and monetize the game even more going forward"
---
no more, no less. as for the future of the game, it'll be online so long it's profitable. the content will keep on being borderline acceptable and/or functional as we're stuck with B team. or F, rather. and then, if we're lucky enough, they'll handle us the server keys before shutting it down for good.
---
Even if most folks only go for one month, Bethesda is making a lot of money off this, which will further incentivize.
---
XD I drove my friend nuts with it.
---
Many players asked for a sub... But you're trying to get a rise out of people.
---
I don't think anyone can give you numbers but been here for a while and every atom shop bad post had some who said they would rather pay for content. Idk why but thats whats comfortable to them i guess.
---
I was happy with overpriced atom shop stuff cause others paid for my content. I don't consider skins important enough to pay for but i do like long grinds to get them.
---
"Literally just unlimited crafting storage" (for some players, not all) is game changing by itself IMO because the reasons I posted up there.
---
These are two key features of the subscription. I don‚Äôt see either ever coming to the atom shop unless something replaced them. Maybe an unlimited stash box for subscription which seems very unlikely.
---
Lol you bought into a p2w system...u deserve to get wrecked by game bugs.
---
Its completely ridiculous. I'm not much of an elder scrolls fan but I do worry for the future of ES6. Fallout which is my favourite franchise has been fucking destroyed by Bethesda. First fallout 4 which derailed the series a bit then 76 that drove it off into a bottomless chasm that gets worse and worse the farther down it gets. Like I said I'm not much of a fan but I hope ES fans get what fallout fans have not.
---
u/gothpunkboy89 still here claiming Bethesda good and Obsidian bad, because the launch of NV was buggy.
---
You can't make this shit up. In his mind this game offers no p2w and everything is ok.
---
I think you got a god roll fixer there my guy. 4&amp;5 stars aren't released yet, you can see other effects like this on a few other effects. But that piece is reaaaally good for a sneak sniper
---
No sir, all things listed were lost completely
---
Thank you and I will!
---
yes, but we got to look after another. lets all agree that people who bought the member ship all sided with the rail road in fallout 4.
---
I would disagree, though I understand where you're coming from. To me, it does NOT have to be randomized for monetization to be scummy. Apex Legends is an example (the NON random stuff anyways). You can (limited time only) buy a skin you want, the coolest type, Legendaries. But for 20 freaking dollars. So 3 skins is the price of a brand new game. That's ludicrous and I say VERY scummy, I count that as taking a few miles because of not just the price but the added stress of "timed only" so if you don't get it now, you may never be able to again. It doesn't have to be gambling for it to be disgusting, friend, and we shouldn't give companies the go-ahead to do anything as long as it's not gambling. We'll start to see full $60 skins if that's the case. Just having reasonably priced awesome stuff that you can ALWAYS choose to buy when you want, that is what games should strive for, and if they don't make enough money on the stuff, don't make more costumes and stuff, if they do make a good bit, then make more so people can enjoy them and spend more. It's just that simple. I would even say $10 for a Legendary Skin in Apex would be reasonable, not sure how many would agree, but of course that's also only if it wasn't "timed only." Sorry to bring Apex into this but I feel that's one of the easiest systems to change into a reasonable one, whereas Fallout 76 has to be completely revamped in how everything is monetized, in my opinion. 
---

Gambling boxes and ludicrously priced legendaries to me is taking thousands of miles, because gambling should be thousands of miles away from gaming, and Legendary items (like the Apex skins) are something so many people love and would buy a ton of IF reasonably priced, that's how I view the matter.
---
That old top right cave area
---
Thanks! :)
---
Who would dare to atack people with special needs?
---
People have been posting about not geeting hits on legendaries during events since the begining of the game. BGS could have done something about it months ago, it's hard to blame it solely on the player. I agree it's frustrating. Like I don't use my main weapons during events because of this and I ended up just not doing events anymore. It's not really fun or challenging to stand around and try not to kill things
---
I can't even Build My Camp Back! I have nothing to build with! :(

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis.

---
But the main problem \*IS\* the issues with the pay to win stuff, nobody has a problem with the servers, yet.
---
Yeees yeees let the blessings flow through you
---
I hope all of you that buy into this ridiculous p2w bs get all the gamebreaking bugs, especially the one that deletes your characters.
---
These past few weeks with Bethesda, has been more like a slippery cliff.
---
only if people keep buying it. which they won't. the ranger outfit was their trump card and they played it.
---
unless, of course, they adopt even more predatory p2"convenience" tactics, which would end up making the game p2w.
---
Still a lot of people in the world I was in
---
yeah they getting charged
---
I was so hyped for 76. I mean just so so hyped. I live in West Virginia, I love Fallout, it was a train wreck waiting to happen. I pre-ordered for $80. Not only was my city (third largest in the state) just straight up excluded from the game, but it was basically unplayable because the servers were so unstable and the glitches were never ending. I spent $80 and I didn't even get a paperweight. All I got was a broken heart and about 100 gigs of wasted hard drive space (which has since been claimed back.) Now, I held onto hope as long as I could, played for as long as I could and there were definitely some fun things in the game (when I was able to use their glitchy broken servers,) and I figured that they'd eventually figure it out because it's their first online game. Yet, even still, they continually and unendingly drag this game through the mud. Like the NPC update was dope and a sign of better times, but god damnit for every step forward, they turn tail and run backwards like a moonshiner from the cops.
---
Hats are different. They're entirely cosmetic in a multiplayer game that went F2P not long after they were introduced and don't cost all that much unless you buy from the Mann Co. Store for some reason (although it is pretty shit of Valve to massively overprice bundles that are worth like $5 at most).
---
Horse Armour was some ugly cosmetics for an entirely singleplayer game, and is like a twelfth of the price of Shivering Isles. You know, that gargantuan expansion that everyone who played Oblivion loves?
---
Naw. I still have hope for ES6.
---
Wow having to pay for a server, I‚Äôve never heard of such an atrocity
---
I think I have a realistic view of how criticism works
---
Vote with your wallet
---
you are still charged.

Hi! The Pitchfork Protection Plan costs 500 caps every 30 days or 10,000 for the year!
---
Calling on me costs 200 caps as well. I'll send the bill to your secretary.
---
There is no better way to put this: Bethesda supporters are legitimately brain-dead. They deserve to suffer, and the new sub is just Bethesda giving people much needed beatings.
---
I mean, come ON people. We knew this was going to only ever get worse. Bethesda is an entirely incompetent company. They have been for a long-ass time, what with modders having to fix everything for them.
---
 So because you played &amp; have a copy you think your opinion matters? 
---
Opinions are like assholes everyone has one &amp; no one wants you to share yours with them.
---
These money chuckers already think they own the place. First our scrap now our legendarys! Wheres it end??
---
I can understand that there will be a few bugs here and there, but have you seen the multiple reviews of almost nothing working as intended? Absolute crap, they shoved this crap out the door knowing full well it was buggy as shit.  That's fine if you're happy paying for crap; that's your choice. I will not support garbage no matter how much I like the Fallout series.
---
I find it ironic that the Ranger outfit was one of the most, if not *THE* most requested outfits for the shop, and now that it's here it's suddenly considered to be the most scummy thing Bethesda has ever done. How "they're pandering to nostalgia" or how "they didn't even create the outfit and yet they have the gall to monetize it" and how "this is obviously a pathetic attempt at a bribe to buy the membership." (And these are all actual criticisms some people have brought up against it)
---
I'm pretty sure those are the same people who instantly dropped $12 for the 1-month membership without a second thought just to get the outfit
---
Also, I don't get how there are some people who genuinely believe the outfit looks *worse* than it did in New Vegas, that "it looks like a cheap mod." Like, those people must be wearing some pretty heavy rose-tinted glasses
---
Wow I'm surprised. Usually just moving camps works. It's a funny work around when people destroy your camp
---
My favorite Pete Hines quote, is the whole "There's a line and we won't cross it". Like bitch, you not only cross that line, you salt the earth before you moonwalk to the other side.
---
What's the PTR?
---
then your argument should be "The Tent and the Scrap stash should not be part of the subscription" not "get rid of the subscription or make it a one time payment".
---
Thanks for the offer! But I‚Äôve just finished getting all the necessary ingredients for a replacement, glad there are people in the community like you üëçüèª.
---
What an incel.
---
Ruined one game in the series, So far at least I'm sure they can ruin more if they put their minds to it, the rest are still good no matter how much this one is being squeezed for every possible drop of money like a poor half starved cash cow.  And yes I know some don't like FO4 but I do.
---
Crafting materials are a big thing in that game too and that bag really made no difference, was my point. And the fridge, is pointless. Food is stupid easy to farm. Animals and items are everywhere. And there is no real winning in this game. Besides I will still sit here and say, they need to increase stash size. Along with some other things. My only point is, is that both with the fridge, bot, kits and now this, they really have not impacted the game nor have they effected me. The people who will always have the advantage, is people with OP set ups, and/or legacy items. We can agree to disagree but, my point is this is getting blown out of porportions more than it should.
---
Suffer, and be broken!
---
Well the private server let's you claim workshops without pvp like you said. The p2w thing is the unlimited scrap in storage space
---
But understand that it is completely fair for you to be criticized in collective as a dev team for the game you made.  I laid it out pretty reasonably that the dev team as whole will be criticized for what they create and continue to create... particularly when they are so married to the Publisher (in this came this is a 1st party release for them)
---
Am I mad at everyone individually?  No, but I don't give them a pass from criticism as a collective.
---
I'm sorry, but you bought into the meme. Let this be a lesson for next time.
---
Interesting. PM me!!
---
I guess. Never had any interest. I prefer a public server
---
Oooo
---
I'd predict that if we could see the numbers that many of them actually did quit. I can't imagine the game is doing super well if they are making so many changes to how the game in financed even knowing the bad PR they're going to get from it.
---
As for me, I just started playing again because I wanted to see what Wastelanders was all about. This stuff rubs me the wrong way though so definitely not going to stick around when there is nothing currently to do in the game.
---
Unless your talking about buffs to your stats that mainly come with meat, to keep my stats up and full I maintain a healthy diet of spoiled vegetables and inert flux
---
Can i still come here to complain??
---
Thank you
---
yep and the atoms many people are buying the one month then claiming the outfit and atoms and emotes then canceling their membership
---
Hey when people throw a shit fit about 76 but make excuses for NV was and still is a buggy shit show that relies on player mods to fix it. 
---
Just because you get upset when I call out your hypocrisy doesn't mean you have to have a tantrum.
---
Pay to win? not really but thats only due to the lack of win conditions in fallout if they existed you could be pretty sure they would be packaged up and sold.
---
No, what we have here is the start of a fee-to-pay game where you buy a full-priced game and then in order to get the "full experience" (also known as not being a second class citizen) you then need to stump up more money. This goes beyond dlc and add-ons.  Its core gameplay functionality (server stability, no competition for loot spawns or workshops) and by paying you get an easier ride of it.
---
And this is not a cosmetic thing it's not skins or pretty colors to paint yourself with its selling "convenience" and "time-saving."(and before long it'll be outright advantage if people are willing to pay for it.) Fallout 76 is at this point on the brink of being a mobile game at least in its monetization except for the thing is its not clash of clans you didn't get it for free no we paid full price to have the opportunity to hand over more money in order to get the game we where sold in the first place.
---
Haven‚Äôt even played the full game? What is this a hate bandwagon? Geez
---
r/ExplainLikeImFive please?
---
"1-4 The EDF deploys!"
---
Funny, because reading your posts its always you that deflect it that way.
---
Yeah because 1=100
---
Started with Todd Howard in Oblivion and F3
---
Same here.  i made a post earlier at them not even doing a Inside the vault today.     I mean there's gotta be something they can talk about other then Fallout 1st to keep us engaged.
---
Hell yeah!
---
Doesn‚Äôt for me
---
If you willingly fall for the fo76 con not once but multiple times, you deserve to have your private server fleeced from right under you. So yes, go ahead pay the $100 and show Bethesda what a fat whale you are, just ready to be fleeced for all you're worth. It doesn't matter if it's $50 or $100 when you've shown yourself ok with throwing good money after bad.
---
The devil laughed so hard that a fart crackled through his asscheeks.
---
The fixer naturally grants that stealth bonus but that is a good piece. Faster fire rates desirable.
---
Upvoted!
---
Sounds like taxes were too high ;D
---
Are you sure its no fucks given?
---
Like if go though your history am i going to find a post saying "lots of fucks given" from a couple of months ago ?
---
I don‚Äôt know about you, but I tend to wait quietly or leave the room when someone flies into a rage. No good can come of interacting with them until they calm down.
---
&gt;these are all actual criticisms some people have brought up against it
---
everything you just typed is true, though. I can see where you're coming from and yes, the hypocrisy is appalling.
---
but you know what's more scummy? using the most request thing in the entire game to peddle their new business model, because they know it'd be a failure otherwise.
---
and regarding the mesh, no, it didn't look better in NV, but yes, it does look terrible here. both in the promotion shot (overexposure, much?) and in-game.
---
it's like they hate Obsidian so much they had to give it a final finger as Outer Worlds released.
---
"The bridge is only half completed? Are you sure? So I can't make it if I try to jump it? But it's half done. Don't try to jump it? Okay I'm jumping it."
---
oops I didn't know it was on reset,  and I'm so sorry my friend
---
Not moving them at all, it‚Äôs literally more than just one or two issues overall so it all makes it happen. 
---
There was 5 people including myself in the server, smoothest I‚Äôve ever seen it run. Launched a nuke, did events, everything. 
---
I hope Bethesda looks at that and compares it to see what drains there are on it overall. 
---
Dupers crashed servers, that happens a lot at the height of duping. Replicating a million Nuka grape and more will have its issues in game. Some bragged about weighing over a million pounds! That‚Äôs a hella lot of ammo and more! 
---
That has to effect stability.
---
That was the player base that stayed loyal and tried to make fun out of a very flawed game. At least No Mans Sky was grateful and it paid off mutually.
---
You can refund the charge within 30 days. This will cancel the subscription. It appears you will get charged right away but when you refund the money the 12.99 should come back within 5 days since it's still is Pending for me. I'll post again the final result but I was told by other redditors that this should be full proof and I have full confidence that Bethesda can't  steal money through this method
---
Preform the great cleansing ritual
---
This is a good question.  Player since Beta, love the game in spite of its flaws, and I want to give Bethesda money because of the value it continues to provide, but I can't justify it as currently presented.  I want more atoms, and the price per item is reasonable based on in-game atom  earning, but WAY out of wack for real-world money.  Give me 5-10 times the atoms, and I will hand over some money.  As for the sub, make it $5/month (no yearly discount), 5-10 times the atoms, and other cool exclusive cosmetic items.  At that price I would be sold and likely keep playing until the day they turn it off.
---
Money talks.
---
I was just about to clarify, it‚Äôs not getting the hit that‚Äôs the troll. It‚Äôs the fact they clearly have a private server available to them but choose to do it on a public one.
---
Nope... just enjoying a game I like playing...  it‚Äôs literally that simple...
---
I kept seeing the same camps last week and i too won't be logging in for a long ass time after this. It is dwindling.
---
Do the monster mash event you get Halloween candy. It weighs nothing. You can go with the carnivore mutation it allows you to eat raw meat with double the food restoration and no disease chance alternatively the herbivore mutation does the same but with veggies. You can also claim the sunshine meadow industrial farm. There you can make pre war packaged food. I suggest setting it on Salisbury steak.
---
Well what the hell! I haven‚Äôt gone into a private server server just because of this! I built the box in adventure and moved all my junk into it but I‚Äôm too scared to try to go to my own server. I really got the month just so I could get the atoms and the outfit etc. I was going to buy atoms to get the samurai outfit anyways!
---
bought  tricentennial edition for me and my best mate and still play. still spent over 100 bux in atom store, wheres this line at?
---
If your using bloodied melee I go with mutant hound chops, mutton chops, glowing meat steak, deathclaw steak, and drink whiskey for +2 str
---
&gt;but you know what's more scummy? using the most request thing in the entire game to peddle their new business model, because they know it'd be a failure otherwise.
---
I mean, the "It would be a failure otherwise" part is debatable, but this really isn't different from them making a $10 Atom Bundle for E3 and tagging Elder Maxson's Coat as an exclusive item with the bundle tbh. And in both cases, it worked anyway
---
No problem! Sorry you lost your camp,  That really sucks. At least building can be kinda fun though.
---
For what it's worth, we knew the servers were going to cost money from the get go
---
‚ÄúSmart with their resources ‚Äú hahahahahahaha üòÇüòÇüòÇ.
---
You guys don't need Fallout. Anybody in Australia basically has Mad Max happening in their backyard.
---
Want gripping survival against crazy, possibly mutated animals? Go for a brisk walk off the side of the road. üòÇü§£üòÇü§£
---
I hoped for both to be honest. I was excited to some degree for a multiplayer experience but held out hope that it wouldn't singularly be as such. I wanted a solo experience at the foundation, with the option for co-op with small groups and an option to join in on "mmo"-esq servers that would effectively be what 76 ended up being. That would have been a roadmap to success. Or at least a more well received game.
---
I knew that's what we weren't getting. That's just what I really wanted from Bethesda. We as the players never do quite get what we want. Sadly.
---
Yeah, I'd drop all my caps for that
---
What's sad is, people will spend $13 just for the outfit and the atoms and then cancel their subscription, but that doesn't refund your $13. You still gave bethesda $13 and you didn't even use the (albeit, obviously broken) service you technically bought.
---
I assume these same people will be surprised when bethesda uses more greedy tactics, but they know how this works. They know just enough people will be suckered in, so this is actually partly the fallout 76's community's fault. You know who you are. Stop buying bethesda's shit. No more of this "spend your money how you want" crap, you're part of the problem.
---
Actually I am a software developer for the Navy and our software goes through rigorous testing before being certified by the CCB, then ran side by side with the fielded system it is replacing. I know it's apples to oranges.   
---
It just seems that game studios push the envelope as to how much gamers will put up with before refusing to purchase their beta software. No way am I blaming this on the actual developers.
---
Seeya man. It was fun while it lasted.
---
Ha. You are going to have quite list of email addresses and identities there.
---
I don't care about communism ranting on the webs... Nither does most of the people I've seen in game.
---
I shot legendary bat out of the sky with my plasma rifle today. Nothing but good changes this patch.
---
We told people servers would be paid and for some reason the "singleplayer" cucks still thought it would be free.
---
Also im looking forward to outworlds im a year or so once they have all dlc released. Some how buying pieces of a singleplayer game is fine now.
---
Tbf the stash weight is a problem, junk is fine but just junk. Things like Armor and weapons are why they cant have an infinite stash.
---
That said the junk thing should be in the main game and not a paid addon
---
Good for you, I wish mine was like yours and ‚Äújust fine‚Äù
---
Holy cow this is game breaking
---
Sorry for you, but that is your fault. Did you seriously think that anything Bethesda releases for F76 works? The game is out for months now, have you seen how it launched? Have you read about the server issues they are STILL having? The fact that you seriously paid for that subscription is the slap in the face you deserve, if you haven't seen the 500 warning signs around this game so far, maybe you finally see them now. It's now about if F76 is a good game or not, or if its fun or not, it is BROKEN. It launched broken, and it was never fixed. Wake up, man...
---
So when you break up with an ex and "move on", you nick stuff from their flat?
---
&gt;I hope Bethesda looks at that and compares it to see what drains there are on it overall.
---
I can answer that for you: their netcode sucks. the creation engine barely works, but let's tackle online functionally on it and see what happens.
---
of course it performs better with less people online. it shouldn't be online in the first place. they're not going to look into it and it's ludicrous that I have to pay to have a decent experience because of their incompetence. it's unacceptable.
---
&gt;That has to effect stability.
---
perhaps. but why is my experience just as bad now as it was then? why are the server always crap, whether there's a public exploit or not?
---
damn just as I was getting heated
---
I see your POV but there are numerous events with a few players and someone comes along and does it. I‚Äôve seen numerous posts and many defending that player... ok... so now some request a private server... now they can do it. 
---
Does that effect you doing it again? Nope... farm away!
---
You haven‚Äôt seen the new footage?
---
https://youtu.be/IGptnXXJQhY
---
For $/¬£/‚Ç¨1
---
You can get the Xbox Game Pass for PC and play The Outer Worlds. And still spend that ¬£99/$99/$99 on everything else.
---
It isn't deflection.  People like you rant and rave about shitty game developers that release broken unfinished games.  And with FO specifically that they need player made mods to fix their shitty games.
---
Yet when NV is brought up suddenly you have every excuse in the book to validate their shitty, unfinished game that requires player mods to fix it.
---
You are literally that person who declares weed a dangerous substance that should never be legalized as you smoke your 12th cigarette of the day and take a sip of your 10th can of beer.
---
missteps*
---
Sorry. It seems they've both been headlining lately. Mixed em up.
---
Seriously Bethesda, stop fucking over your customers. Otherwise, go fuck yourselves
---
This whole subscription thing is cause they‚Äôre broke. Just my 5 cents
---
Yeah this is something I can get behind make it unlockable by a quest I'd suggest 
---
If anything the reason they target "whales" is so they have a revenue its expensive to run an online game much less run other games at the same time (labour, bills, server costs and so on) its possible they panicked and this was a choice they was letting with although I'd say it did ruin my mood if F76 I'm still gonna play it but still
---
Wish I could
---
I like how snippets of the music play with the Halloween Vending Machine. I never knew different Vending Machines play different music
---
First link was to show you that there are reports, second link (if you read the comments) shows multiple different players confirming they have dead NPC‚Äôs and looted areas in their ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù worlds.  Don‚Äôt try a lecture me on an accusation. I‚Äôve provided you proof, and people have confirmed suspicions of the accusation which make it true. 
---
You said I was a ‚Äúreactionary dickhead with no knowledge on the subject‚Äù and so to prove to you I know what I‚Äôm talking about I pointed out my username and experience with the franchise to show you I‚Äôm not just anybody who is commenting on a thread. You‚Äôre hypocrisy is showing, all that coming from the ‚Äúsit down‚Äù guy. Yea ok Mr Boss man. 
---
Also ‚Äúdon‚Äôt try to flex you dick muscles on fallout knowledge‚Äù and you immediately go ‚ÄúOH YEAH well I‚Äôve ALSO played Tactics and BoS HuR DuR‚Äù 
---
A hypocrite through and through.
---
Just wanted to tell you that you‚Äôre not alone. I had to google to find out how to place it. Once you know it makes sense but it wasn‚Äôt at all obvious to me.
---
Going off the title alone? God I hope so. This game should serve as a testament to awful releases of unfinished and completely broken games. Prioritizing monetization over getting this game somewhat feature complete is absolutely disgusting. Not to mention the complete lack of care for their reputation and image by back tracking on their initial word. Bethesda 100% deserves the backlash they are getting.
---
So i lurked around this sub after laughing my ass about  Fallout 1st but you sir take the clown award now I genuinely know why fallout76 didn‚Äôt shutdown it‚Äôs because of people like you on this sub
---
Shame it was sold in Australia where consumers have rights.
---
https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/consumer-rights-guarantees/consumer-guarantees
---
Products must:
---
    match descriptions made by the salesperson, on packaging and labels, and in promotions or advertising
---
    be fit for the purpose the business told you it would be fit for and for any purpose that you made known to the business before purchasing
---
    not carry any hidden debts or extra charges
---
As Bethesda Promised Private Servers as a feature of their product that was coming, and also promised all content and DLC would be free, means we either paid for the private server as part of the base product, or it is an addon that was promised to be free.
---
Either way, we paid for it already.
---
Some of these games today will claim Beta until the day they die.
---
Quote me.
---
At least mods fixed it. You don't even have that here ;)
---
Edit: "It isn't deflection."
---
LOL. Everytime anyone says anything bad about fo76 you go "BUT NV", but in your mind that isn't deflection. Right. This game is really for SPECIAL people, very very special people.
---
Does that mean you cant get masks anymore at all or its super rare drop still. I dont understand the codes and stuff.
---
Wow hardcore Fallout fan, I tip my hat to you, Fallout 3 was my first but that game has a real personal affliction with me regarding real life
---
You aren‚Äôt lying. It‚Äôs their last resort to get as much money from this game.
---
Zenimax is a private company, and Bethesda is its wholly-owned subsidiary.
---
Pay them 30 dollars a month and they will fix the bugs.
---
actually I paid full price for this game at launch - stupidly, since it went on sale like 2 weeks after. So yeah I still follow it, since I love Fallout games in general. Hopefully the wastelanders DLC will be good, perhaps I'll give it a go. just disappointing to see how low Bethesda will go.
---
dead to me*
---
played*
---
paid*
---
Lol^2
---
This might be better than the no man's sky drama
---
I still think Oblivion is one of the best games ever made, and better than Skyrim.  Shame it now goes to show how far Bethesda has fallen.
---
Me being a hypocrite and buying the subscription tomorrow after I said I wouldn‚Äôt*üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
üí®üï∫üï∫üï∫üï∫üï∫
---
Yeah I noticed that too.
---
I've been shitting all over this game since day one, which is exactly what it deserves. You jerks downvoted almost anything calling out Bethesda. IT SERVES YOU ALL RIGHT! Grats on wasting your time and money. If you ever even play this game for 1 more second, you are a complete sap and I have no respect for you. #BOYCOTTBETHESDA
---
The truly sad part of this is that after the huge backlash, they will probably backpedal and offer this stuff for free and people will return to be milked again. 
---
I'm not falling for Bethesda's shit anymore. I'm not getting their shitty space game and I will 100% pass on the elder scrolls 6 until its practically free via a steam sale. Fuck them and their shitty business practices.
---
grew up playing your games*
---
This 100%.
---
The community isn't shitty because they are bad people, the community is shitty because they keep paying for the horse shit Bethesda is shoveling them and essentially being the sole reason the game won't get better.
---
Yes that‚Äôs possible but that certainly shouldn‚Äôt be your default assumption because that‚Äôs for sure not the majority.
---
Have you tried giving them more money? They seem to like that stupid prewar cotton more then they like us.
---
Slope?  I thought it was a cliff formed by blatant erosion
---
Okay but $100 a year??? Really? and thats only for 8 people. plus the monthly membership to even play online on consoles.
---
I'm sorry but if you genuinely think this is a good idea you are just delusional. You can like a game, sure, but at least admit that this is a cash grab.
---
They build the cost of fixes and updates into the business plan. Bug fixes are part of the base cost of the game. They said DLCs would be free. Those costs were built into the initial business plan. Paid subscriptions should not be used for expenses related to the above costs.
---
I will say the fact they don‚Äôt have a backup of a players character sucks... they should be able to restore anyone to a given point and at least return them to a previous state of backup. But they don‚Äôt. 
---
They also could look to see who was duping by doing a query search and seeing who produced what... I think it was boards or knives... something like that not sure... or who had a stack of 5 identical TSE‚Äôs... 
---
There‚Äôs a lot they could have done but didn‚Äôt. 
---
Like I said, the private server was smooth! Not kidding! It would sell anyone how smooth it was. 
---
I‚Äôm positive they can see or at least know what the primary issues are but are silent just like the 23rd release no one saw coming.
---
I get that. But with the monthly fee, it seems like they've actually made their mtx items even cheaper than before, but you get the bundle as is.
---
But I totally see what you're saying and share the same concern.
---
You wouldn't have tagged me if what I said wasn't true.  Your actions give you away.
---
Added my two cents. I'll be sure to spread the survey around.
---
New content? Ahahahhaha nope
---
Sadly there are still ignorant people who trust them, but thankfully a lot of people who did before are now realizing why not to.
---
Saying its P2W is a strawman argument. It's disingenuous as well as being in bad faith.
---
Nope. Imho, most of the people I've met in game are some of the best and generous players I've ever met.
---
Also, by the way I don‚Äôt down vote opinions so if you had a downvote please don‚Äôt think it was me.
---
It doesn‚Äôt as far as I‚Äôm concerned you can enjoy your private sever to the fullest. The fallout first thing seems like a scam to me (jus because I think it should be base game, but eh what can I say I don‚Äôt play) and the community lashed out and seen it in my feed so figured I‚Äôd see what the whole up roar was about. Either way happy hunting or what ever you wanna do imma keep playing monster hunter! Good talk, thanks for sharing your view.
---
Sure no problem, I'm on xbox. You purchase just the one month (they will charge you right away as it appears that way in my Gmail and bank account info)  reload fallout 76 after you confirm purchase and go into atom shop. In featured you will see the Ranger armor, emotes/icons, scrap box, and the tent.
---
      Just push A on what you want as all these featured items will say "free" on them. Go in adventure mode and make sure you can craft the ranger armor on the armor workbench, place tent by opening up the hotwheel and push Y and place it if you want, for the scrap box go into build mode and the "stash boxes" section and it will be at the top. 
---
      When you've made sure all is accounted for go back to your Microsoft account and into your manage subscriptions and you will have a refund option that is valid within first 30 days of purchase. When you refund the purchase you will lose the personal server benefit at the end of the month and your scrap box will no longer hold infinite scrap but then again people have reported scrap disappearing so I don't trust it. 
---
     You will be notified by via email and your bank a count will show the -$12.99 below a +$12.99 once you've confirmed the refund. It's still Pending for me since Pending transactions can take about 5 days. I was told about this method from multiple redditors and I will let y'all know if Bethesda thinks they can fool the credit transfer but I highly doubt it
---
They have to get funding somewhere to keep the servers up.
---
Survival was redundant once NW arrived.
---
Fallout 1st is okay for those who end up using the atom shop regularly  and for those who play the gsme on a daily basis. 
---
You dont keep a game alive by simply playing the game. Devs and companies dont recieve any money once the original purchased has processed. 
---
I would have loved to play a game like goldeneye as a child and simply get new maps every once in a while because the devs wanted to do some pro bono work
---
Yeah but next month'll have another cool cosmetic! Do you really wanna miss that? Guessed so just sign here 99.99 dollars please
---
I appreciate it friend, but them making something cheaper doesn't matter if it's still not a reasonable price, you feel me? It's actually a tactic where companies will price something SO over the top, that they backtrack it somewhat and get praised for backtracking when they backtracked to exactly what they originally wanted, so that they wouldn't get backlash by starting with that price. It's another scummy tactic these companies use.
---
Hmmm, close but no cigar. I just think your fanboy-ism in the face of such dismal announcements is hilarious. 
---
So, paying for having unlimited scrap space is still not an advantage in your opinion? You should get your head out of Todd's ass someday, smell the roses and explore other horizons will do ya good.
---
They succumbed a long time ago.  Please look how many different full-priced versions of Skyrim have been released and re-released over the last decade.
---
I preordered, tried the beta, and refunded after 2 hours.
---
Can I still buy games, and collectibles, and shirts from Bethesda though?
---
Then those SAME people are crying about losing their stash of junk.
---
&gt;However, now that it is here, from a purely financial standpoint its a win for anyone who was already throwing money already at the game on a regular basis.
---
Note that this inherently assumes that the atoms were worth what Bethesda was charging for them.  Bethesda can set whatever prices they want, that doesn't mean its actually good value.
---
We have no problem with opinions at all. But please remember, your issue is with BGS's policy, not the other players. Or, your problem is you're just having "too much fun" enjoying the game, and won't get down by the "haters". Either way, there is no need to attack one another. And that's what most of the removed posts are. 
---
In addition, your post must add something to the conversation. Simply saying that you're leaving the game because of X, Y, Z doesn't add to the conversation. We consider this spam. In a few days, after the conversation has died off, we'll post a thread about the topic, and put a close to it. For now, the world must burn, but a controlled one.
---
Lastly, this sub is for Fallout 76. Not Outer Worlds.
---
While I for one am not particularly salty (were it not for the scrap thing, I'd view this as perfectly reasonable instead of kinda shitty), they did talk a lot of shit about no p2w elements, and while I don't think any of this is really p2w (I am still playing sans membership, and don't really care about not being able to cram infinite shit in a box), it's close enough that I can understand the outrage, more so than the previous outrages. 
---
That said... today I have seen a \*lot\* of scrap boxes in world today, so I suspect the non-outraged masses are doing their part to keep this game free for me. To be honest, if you're inclined to buy atoms, you may as well fucking get the sub for a month, it is a good price \*compared to normal\* for them. I feel atoms are overpriced to begin with, but this is much closer to a price point I feel is reasonable.
---
I care. I like open world games as well and that's just what I would prefer here lately. If not I just cant get into being guided to follow a story.
---
Glad it worked out üôå
---
I hate to say I told ya so, but...
---
Outer worlds is pretty damn good...
---
Yeah, but they took away something that was free... and now they‚Äôre charging a lot of money for access
---
Preach.
---
Just come back once wastelanders is out.
---
Yep, noticed this when I went to the Nuka Cola plant among several other areas and was expecting for the areas to be stocked as if never touched but it was. And when I went to the ‚Äúrecent‚Äù tab, others had been on the server prior at some point. Makes sense, I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
We're over 12,000 mod actions in the last 24 hours. :/
---
You are getting downvotes but you are absolutely right. Todd Howard confirmed that their next games will also be running on their 20 year old GameBryo engine.
---
Look at Obsidian. They switched to Unreal Engine 4 with The Outer Worlds and it looks and plays like a dream. Todd Howard recently bragged about putting god rays in his game...a feature from 2007 PC games like F.E.A.R. Working elevators is also a recent feature for their game engine. 
---
Guess which studio is behind the curve?
---
We live in a society and many of us are damaged. Become a Fallout 1st member; become one of us. Gooble gobble.
---
It's not the gane devs either, It's upper management
---
oh, I don't mind that. the only reason why I use reddit at all is this sub and the market one, to keep up with news, datamines, technical information, etc.
---
anyway, enjoy your server.
---
&gt;!I might buy one once they fix the scrap box just for the infinite 5.56. god knows I hate farming lead.
---
You shouldn't ask these questions here. You're just going to get troll answers and personal attacks from a bunch of basement dwellers.
---
You can get a warm glass of shut the hell up!
---
Because Fallout no other game like itüï∫
---
Fallout 76 Tricentennial edition for PC is currently $9.99 from Bethesda. They‚Äôre looking to make money in-game now. Not from sales.
---
I‚Äôm super sorry but are you also angry or supportive of the patch. Like I said I‚Äôm really sorry and I‚Äôm not being sarcastic
---
A solid 7, great gameplay, but some bad bugs and crashes
---
Been playing since release and am thinking I might uninstall now.  Not happy.  Going to pickup and play Metro Exodus.  Been putting that off as I am a one game at a time kind of player.
---
Thanks hoss for the explanation. I understand it's a controlled silence right now. I just thought maybe there was something I was missing. I appreciate the response tho!
---
Here's my thoughts.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm8yw7/bethesda\_you\_disgust\_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm8yw7/bethesda_you_disgust_me/) 
---
tl;dr Fuck bethesda and fuck 76, done with this shitshow of a game. Don't even care if wastelanders is good or more content comes, FUCK THEM!
---
Isnt it logical that people would get a used server? Otherwise, people could server hop to a brand new server each time, and farm certain areas over and over throwing off game balance, right? It would make sense the servers would then be previously generated so as to not have to create a new server for each "1ster" every time they server hop... I agree, Bethesda has gotten very money grabby, I just dont see another way to do this without throwing off the game balance. I dont see this as being sold or marketed as a "server respawn button" , but more as a way to charge you to play by yourself. If this membership allowed the ability to whip up virgin servers upon server hop, it would definately give an unfair paid advantage to members.. not that it doesnt already,..
---
A lot of popular online games move towards memberships. How else do you expect bethesda to keep paying for the servers?
---
Solid 7, loses points cuz no NPCs, small details like random disconnects WHEN I DRINK WATER, magazine taking a lot of stash space, the atom shop slowly becoming p2w.
---
The list goes on but its not things thatll make me cut my veins so its fine :)
---
Why do some people stay in an abusive relationship?
---
Uhhhh? That doesn‚Äôt even make sense.
---
I mean, it's 100% upper management that's making these decisions not the Devs or PR
---
I'm having fun
---
Wait has anyone got their money back through the refund option, pending transactions usually last 5 days at most
---
Spawn rates do seem wonky. I had super mutants respawn on me multiple times in West tek and the only other people were on the other side of the map sorting scrap. I would clear it, start looting bodies and then bam every one of them respawned. The meat piles reminded me of the area out front of the golf club back when you could load in and out to respawn the ghouls. Walked out of there with nearly two days worth of scrip.
---
Dont just uninstall, delete the characters too.
---
And like I said in the post, whether u enjoy it or not, dont buy the subscription. It's a matter of principle becuase if u really enjoy this game then ud realise buying whatever they shill hurts it, giving them an excuse to never truly improve it and leave things broken. Look at all the people deleting there blizzard accounts over the China debacle. I'll admit thats way bigger than this but it's core concept Carrys over to this one. Besides u said urself about "shitty players", (I met waaay more nice players personally) but u cant sit and call players shitty when so many of them are standing up against this for the betterment of everybody.
---
We should do a class action for false marketing and false representation of their product
---
Solid 7 can be a 9 at times
---
Should have blueprinted everything, the all you would have to do is get materials
---
lol, the amount of people not getting the joke...
---
 Yeah, well, you know, that's just, like, your opinion, man.
---
This is ok
---
people are crying about loosing their stash of junk because its getting deleted more and more people that are actually using the subscription are having junk items deleted after a little bit when they use the junk stash
---
Lol the people saying this is a 7 are dumb as hell. This game is a steaming pile of moldy dog turds.
---
Since it's an online game it would fall under service and not product.
---
Also, if you are going to use the quote from them that they said "All Future DLC and content would be free" then at the same time you have to use the same quotes that said servers were going to be a paid service.  Which would mean it was matching the descriptions by the "salesperson" if you want to call Pete Hines a salesperson. 
---
You'd also have to prove that a private server is content.  It contains the same content as the regular server, premium cusomters just get exclusive access to it, but you still get the same content.
---
Don't its going to be even more streamlined and garbage than Skyrim was/is. The only Skyrim was successful is because of modding. 
---
They're using their other IPs to prod the market with what they can get away with. They are going to implement this shit into ES6 I guarantee it. Shit its probably still going to be on the creation engine too lol. ES6 is going to be the biggest let down of this console generation just mark my words lol.
---
**IF** Wastelanders actually ships, it will be just like everything else with this game: undercooked and broken.  If you‚Äôre still hanging your hat on some notion of future greatness for F76, I suggest you wake up and smell what Bethesda‚Äôs been cooking this entire past year.
---
Thanks for keeping it respectful... we can all have different views but communication is essential either way! Have a good one!
---
My dude, you are comparing MMOs to Fallout 76. Just...stop.
---
People have been dunking on EA for the longest time, they have been criticized to death over shit they do, what the actual hell are you ranting about?
---
Also, someone doing a shitty thing does not excuse others to do the same thing. I really hope you not living your life like that.
---
"The lie detector determined that was a lie"
---
‚Äú1st‚Äù time I‚Äôve seen ‚Äú1st‚Äù used in a consistently negative manner. Where I live, being ‚Äú1st‚Äù is never a bad thing. I‚Äôm sorry Bethesda has jaded you in this way.
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA " its the only game i ever play now so im trying for the month", why do you do that to yourself, you bloody masochist!
---
They said they‚Äôre going to add persistence later? I missed that I guess.
---
Edit: just read it again. Yea I was focused on the increased camp budget part and glossed over the workshop persistence.
---
HOW DO YOU WIN IN FALLOUT 76? And I worked my ASS off getting to the level I am at. I didn't expect to just have it handed to me like some people!
---
I play because I can enjoy the game without spending a cent on it.
---
I got the game for free, I don't spend atoms and I have fun.
---
But I'll not spend an extra cent on this game.
---
I haven‚Äôt put anything in it yet... I feel your pain on farming...lol
---
I ask myself the same question every single day. I guess it's because of the light survival aspect coupled with the goal of becoming a walking nuclear bomb once my build is finished.
---
which is also the main reason why I keep coming back, to optimize my already deadly characters and make them even deadlier. there's absolutely no need and it's the very definition of overkill, but still.
---
if I could play it locally or even backport everything to Fo4, I'd never touch Bethesda's services ever again, though. like I'd completely tune out the "real" Fallout 76 and any news regarding it out of my life, like any sane person did a year ago.
---
If it makes you feel better, from the title of your post I assumed I was on /r/fifthworldproblems
---
Y r u here
---
I lost all my junk in the scrapbox. Built it in adventure mode. Stored there. Logged in tonight and it's all gone. Had 40 bulk plastic plus a lot of other stuff. About 100 weight worth. 
---
Not cool.
---
Yep I‚Äôve honestly lost faith in Bethesda to do the right thing and my excitement for new content or anything with this game has just gone out the window. Thanks Bethesda, for this last nail in the coffin. I‚Äôll be picking up the outer worlds ASAP
---
Absolutey do not disagree.
---
I mean they're digital items where only the first creation costs them much of anything, and often the effort seems minimal. $5 for something it took an artist 15 minutes to make and sold √ó1000 is ridiculous.
---
But it's now industry standard and I don't see it changing any time soon without government regulation. Unfortunately this is where we are with unregulated capitalism.
---
Thanks for the explanation mate!
---
No buy ff instead
---
Expect the worst and your never be disappointed( plus lore is fun)
---
I actually enjoyed the game at launch, but now.... ugh I feel dirty just having a Bethesda account. 
---
I think it's time to dump this studio. I really don't care if I miss out on the thrill of digging through trash barrels and listening to ebook clearance section quality npc stories in the next skyrim game. 
---
that shit just doesn't cut it in today's industry.
---
Hard day at the workshop huh?
---
AND paying for a month of it is the cheapest way to get 1650 Atoms.
---
eso actually got similer backlash on its release, everything started to turn around after one tamriel update. hopefully wastelanders has the same effect as eso is now looked at in rather high regard. i have a feeling the core team is working on starfield and the 76 team is mostly new hires. Theyve spoken a lot recently about how much theyve expanded and an unfortunate byproduct of that is its not all the same people working on everything.
---
If i had the game I‚Äôd probably be joining on this revolution
---
I didn‚Äôt even take it. I was only there for the screws
---
Mine got deleted
---
Um kinda weird that he'd sell it to vendor. Also how do you know he sat there and bulked it all and sold it?
---
A lot of people warned that this game was going to suck, you chose to ignore it though?
---
Workshop = PvP area
---
They should have started with a Doom3 style server system, they used the IDTech Netcode, so it would have been possible.
---
People would have been running private servers from the get-go, while modding the shit out of the game, and just romping the wasteland with friends.
---
And when that gets boring, the modders from Skyrim, would have moved over, as the game engine would make it almost compatable, and the sheer number of game modes, and possibly FO3/nv/4 importers so people can romp the commonweath together.
---
Then they would probably import the skyrim info, or add the OpenVR DLL files that FO76 keeps looking for, and re-enable all the VR features still in the FO76 engine and you would have multiplayer VR fallout/skyrym as well...
---
But, no. Instead of creating a modders dream, they had to try excert total control and made something noone want to try and mod properly due to them loosing their account, or being unable to load anything to test.
---
because as soon as you run a debugger to try find whats wrong with your PC due to the new FO76GPU bug they added recently, you get the client reporting you and getting you banned.
---
Yeah uhh make that bill to uhhhh 
---
Joe
---
Do you require a surname?
---
For starters you pay 99.99
---
From beths statement earlier today: 
---
  ‚Äúwe understand this is not what players expected for their Private  Worlds,‚Äù Bethesda said, meaning that anyone in a friends list may join a  private world without invitation. ‚ÄúWe are looking to provide an option  in an upcoming patch that will allow Fallout 1st members to restrict  access to their servers more completely.‚Äù 
---
So hopefully there should be a fix in a reasonable timeframe. maybe.
---
I think there's a fair bit more than a 'small amount of people' reporting their scrapbox is empty. We'll see how this debacle turns out..
---
Relax with some radiation and radio
---
Had 300 upvotes and rising then.... POOF it was gone.
---
Classic case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time
---
Why else would Watoga station have 98 Bulk Lead in it? 98 x 20 = 1960. That and my team saw him down at the vendor shortly after taking my bag
---
Uh? Every atom challenge is account based, not character based.
---
all of them said "solid 7", what's up with that I wonder
---
Ahahahagahagah well put my fellow man
---
9 at times due to how atmospheric some locations can be, it's generally a fun experience with friends
---
Supposedly they plan to revisit pvp in the near future, so hopefully that'll ring true and remains free, as it should.
---
The great mystery as to how they are still making money, finally revealed
---
Jokes aside, this is a general market tactic built on the brand. In general I COULD have fun with it. I COULD also have fun playing every variation of nearly every fighter, shooter and most any other genre on the market. The thing is you have to try and up your standards as time progresses. These companies only do these things because they know people will cave and still buy it, even if they complain. Voting with your wallet is a real thing, and it isn't just to give BGS the finger, it is also a move of self-respect. Over periods of time they introduce a new, even shittier market scheme in order to make the prior one seem like the favorable alternative, and as many of us know, we tend to have a short memory as a collective human existence.
---
Sorry to word-wall ya there, hope that isn't condescending, just throwing out my thoughts. My personal advice is not to give in to the FOMO. There are plenty of true passion projects that you can probably enjoy just as easily and not get ripped off in the process
---
Solid 7 fun to play and kill hours of time.
---
Same thing applies to ESO and the Crown Store.  Not only that but there's an special sale event going on right now for the Fallout franchise. ESO still and will always be available on gamepass and can always be bought for around 5-10 dollars at select retailers. Also reaffirms my point they're doing this for more undeserved profit. Now from what I hear the premium subscription services don't even work properly, private worlds already looted and junk stashes deleting stored junk.
---
Yeah I definitely see what your saying but just because it doesn't make a big difference. Bethesda said they wouldn't add stuff like this in the first place
---
One thing I would like to do with having. Persistent workshops on a private server would be to use them for community builds.., like community camps and not so much resource gathering.  And be able to place atom shop stuff there because that dirt track workshop + greenhouse = thunderdome weekend with friends.  
---
None of us would want to destroy our camp and that dirt track just has the perfect mood.
---
No shit Sherlock. But I also had no warning that the workshop had been taken. I was just looting the area and died. No warning
---
They didnt ignore it.
---
They listened to the most wanted items and found a way to heavily monetize each and every feature.
---
you are the biggest clown
---
&gt;I think the OP added the MMO style line as well to make the distinction, but yes, as an MMO Lite player none of this seems out of place. Guessing WoW and others conditioned me already
---
Fool me once shame on you. 
---
Fool me twice shame on me. 
---
Fool me thrice and more, you are just dumb and the your fooler is a big piece of ass shit wipes.
---
This is literally Minecraft Realms and people are flipping their shit.  It's nuts.
---
We pay 40$ a pack and 60$ for a 24pk of some beer, some more some less. We don't even have free speech under our constitution, or the 5th, here its called obstruction of justice.  The only people who think our justice system is good are the ones who don't live here
---
8 on a good day, 6-7 on average, 2.5 on a day that a glitch deletes my stuff
---
Can you relax , thanks
---
Yes 100%
---
Only for FF buyers tho right? Thats the way i support it
---
Did u just assume how I live my life? u fucking serious.
---
I was just about to start back up too. Damn.
---
Well, neat.
---
Ah, the old Blizzard trick.
---
I can give it to u for free. Check out subreddit fo76filthycasuals.
---
You the man! Only real men \[Or woman\] can admit they were wrong!
---
Yep, but you won‚Äôt be able to keep your junk if you store it in your scrap box and the game deletes it
---
Nice story bro, highly doubt it tho. Have over 100 people on my friends list who play consistently, none of them even played last night or today... I call bs. Most people are obviously pissed off I'd say.
---
Survival is a different beast than NW... 
---
Pvp isnt a monolithic mechanic.
---
Thats like saying a puzzle game is the same as an rpg because they're both single player.
---
Yes this is totally the time to brag about how loaded you are. You being so rich ( I highly doubt it btw, but lets go with it) does not change the fact that you are dumb with your spending. 
---
And really dude? How pathetic are you that you go around gaming forums trying to show off your riches?! Wow. I get a feeling you do this a lot. I honestly feel bad for you.
---
I can only imagine the response from the one's that bought the yearly pass:
---
"I swear Bethesda, you do this to me 60 or 70 more times and i'm outta here!"
---
I love the patch so many good changes and long time coming fixes... But here we are getting brigaded by communist reddit cause something costs. Litterly one of the best bug fix new cool shit patches. People are mad cause they cant play alone in a multiplayer online game.  Boggles the mind
---
While you have the right to your own opinion, I see you have learned to ignore proper decorum and thus that 5cm you got is showing.
---
Enjoyment in an objectively bad game developed by an objectively bad company. Nice.
---
More power to you.
---
Not from their main website, make sure you buy those specifically from outside the company‚Äôs profit
---
$13. Dollars??? Lol
---
Ok but that new emote is annoying as shit
---
They're trying to recoup losses.
---
So you still play this trash? You are the problem.
---
Yup, literally every slippery slope that gets called out gets downvoted and then later proven right, in basically every game this sort of thing occurs in. Bethesda does not deserve any benefit of the doubt now. Fallout 4 was the last game I preordered and before that I couldn't even tell you the last one. Now they are auto wait for reviews because they are on a throne of lies and not a single thing can be believed from them anymore and frankly shouldn't have been for years now. Sweet little lies were overlooked because the redeeming features of their titles but no more.
---
Love it!
---
Anyone who trusts anything that comes out of that guy‚Äôs mouth deserves what‚Äôs coming to them. Typical snake oil salesman.
---
Woah, woah, woah.... what the fuck does Autism have to do with playing a game? What the fuck crawled up your arse? By the way, being autistic isn't a bad thing nor has it anything to do with Fallout 76? My fiance is autistic and he likes 76. My nephew is autistic and is a structural engineer. Are you poking fun at the mentally ill or making fun of people whose brains are wired differently?
---
 Would you poke fun at me for being deaf, or kn a wheelchair? 
---
You need to get your head out of your arse and stop being a discriminating fucker.
---
I'll get drunk and yell if that helps. My neighbor stoped doing construction at midnight. Proven tactic.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about, I guess it‚Äôs just I the nature of humans to look at bad things more than good things, and you can play the game alone but not technically. Just walking around and stuff can be alone you don‚Äôt have to talk to to people or trade with them
---
I don't think any of the mods are hired. It's a volunteer group and when mod teams bring too many people on too fast you get stuff like what happened with freefolk.
---
By making quality cosmetics and dlc. Not by creating problems in the game and then selling us fixes. You are an idiot if u cannot discern how this practice is ridiculous. This is not the equivalent of am mmo sub.
---
The problem is sometimes people forget that there are cases where slippery slope arguments aren't inherently fallacious.
---
That's very broey of you brobot, thanks for broing out with the bros bro.
---
Personally I‚Äôm really excited for outer worlds tonight!
---
He's actually the prophet of our time and u will die from shock when Bethesda officially announces their first atoms casino franchise worldwide.
---
WELP
---
IIRC it was a temporary bonus that stacked up for each unique outfit in a group. It's not active anymore.
---
I don't understand, if you had not taken the workshop who did. I can wander about in someones workshop and so long as I don't pick locks or doors nothing happens. If someone else comes in and contests that persons workshop I can just stand there and watch.
---
Am I missing something? On a team you say, did they have the workshop?
---
I don‚Äôt think I can. I might call it quits for the night. I‚Äôm not a PvPer. I HATE the stressful situations. I always remain on pacifist, mind my own, stay to myself. I use this game to relax, not work myself up. If I had a warning I would‚Äôve fucking left. I don‚Äôt contest workshops
---
ESO was released unfinished, the same can be said for FO76, this company makes a bunch of cash from skyrim remastered versions, so your hope is minuscule to them
---
7 for now, 8 if they fix couple more bugs, 9 if wastelanders npc will provide interesting quest line and faction system
---
You people deserve everything you got. You deserve to get fucked by Bethesda.
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone was arguing against anyone playing or enjoying 76.
---
Violence? Are you sure that's the word you meant to use? Doesn't it sound kind of silly in reference to an online conversation
---
Easy to vote with daddy‚Äôs credit card
---
the way it could work is the host server has the mods that only the person who owns the server can select so anyone else who uses the server gets access to those mods as an example if they download a m16 riffle mod everyone in game can loot one from a npc
---
I didn‚Äôt contest it. One Giantkey did. I was in the workshop area because it overlaps that building. So when he took it it made me a contester
---
you have to push back at the little stuff give devs an inch they will monetize a mile.
---
I think a lot of people are just justifying it as a one time payment for the outfit. I still wouldn‚Äôt ever subscribe to it.
---
If you're in an unclaimed workshop and someone goes to claim it, they can kill you while you're in the area.
---
Paid for it day one, got about 500 hours worth of play. Would go back for more depending on what is added. 
---
The subscription bit is only a rip off if you're actually paying for it, just like everything in the Atom store. They're selling cosmetics to idiots that will pay for cosmetics, they're selling unlimited storage to idiots that will pay for unlimited storage. If you had to pay a subscription to play the game + 60 bucks in the first place, I could see the outrage. This is a subscription for shit you don't need in the first place.
---
76 is basically a FO4 mod. You have no idea what the code says and you‚Äôre either obviously lying or oblivious.
---
Seems like a waste of lead to me. Also, why are you carrying around so much lead? Really dumb on your part, just saying.
---
My fiance and I love playing 76 - he is autistic (comments relating to that rubbish up there) - and even though it is frustrating as hell, and we have felt like quitting at times, we are 1,000 hours in. Our broadband is down right now so we can't play 76, but we can't wait to get it back up and running. 
---
Can the game be better? Yes! I am deaf, and the game doesn't cater for me to communicate with people on our friends list. Do I complain? Nope! 
---
Dude(tte) stay strong ans keep on being fabulous.
---
They are preying on less informed gamers. Those that don't frequent game news and game forums like reddit and such. Just play 2-3 hrs in the wkend. And tbh I won't be surprised if that mkt is huge.
---
I would definitely like to hear from a first hand account.
---
Oh yes I dabble in eso and the new sub feels very familiar. The main difference is pure content. I just hit 50 in eso by purely questing and I haven't even completed the main zone quest in one of the factions, haven't even started 4 man dungeon diving and I'm very excited to continue.
---
I loved the previous fallouts and I expected to be similarly enjoying 76 in the same way I did eso. Too bad things turned out different
---
I am heartbroken.
---
I literally JUST FINISHED CRAFTING IT! I was in the area and wanted to check the building
---
I think there are two ways.
---
1. Where people use it as a reason not to do something that isn't bad in itself. Ex. We can't legalize same sex marriage because it will eventually lead to people marrying animals. 
---
This is an invalid argument. You can't just extrapolate indefinitely. 
---
2. This corporation or country is doing this shady thing. If we let them go unchecked, they will keep demanding more.
---
This is a valid argument, because there could be people behind the scenes purposely testing the water with the ultimate goal of having as much as possible. If it's worth stopping that change anyway, there's just an additional thing to keep in mind.
---
I just don't pay for anything, it's that easy.
---
Been getting frequent disconnects which i havent had multiples in one day for a few months. Ps4 here.
---
Pretty much, yeah. Enjoy!
---
I have given Bethesda a LOT of shit for Fallout 76, it's inexcusable launch quality, it's unnecessary content like Nuclear Winter....The Scrap and Repair Kits. Overall mechanics being less like Fallout than ever, heavily limited RPG mechanics...The whole "It just works" schtick.
---
But this is to not only be expected, because it's Bethesda....But because server run times costs fucking money. And not only does EVERY single game that offers private, dedicated servers, charge you for this type of service, they will and have charged more than Bethesda is charging here with this service. 
---
"Bold" nothing bold about a perfectly justified cost for services rendered. If people expected to be able to run their own servers and shit, then they were purely hopeful or delusional. If you want to be mad, stop supporting them then. It's not difficult. I paid ¬£11 and I have 400 hours playtime in just about 5-6 months now. And no sign of stopping. 
---
And you know why I got it so cheap? Because you guys kept supporting them but complaining about it heavily. You're giving them more business by refusing to give them less business. Not just from you, but new players who get it and go "It can't be that bad" because they weren't there, they didn't play the "B.E.T.A" that somehow wasn't a beta according to Bethesda. They are picking the game up now, near!t a year later where all the improvements, any new content, has been added for free. And they see it as generous. 
---
By making Bethesda to be the big bad wolf over every little thing, you guys have given people a sense of security in idea that your opinions are worth less, because there are more of you who adhere to the circlejerk logic of thinking "MORE EQUALS CORRECT" when it doesn't.
---
Every single negative reaction to the price, the pure outrage, is objectively unjustified. Sorry, but not sorry. It's true.
---
You can't just go "These benefits are terrible because I want to be mad over literally the most obvious reality because my skills of hindsight are lacking, and my expectations are far higher than they logically should be."
---
You're an idiot if you think talking like this will get through to anyone. Why not just let people enjoy what they want? No one is forcing you to buy it.
---
Lol, that's actually weird
---
Good luck with that.
---
No it isn't an advantage but it is a QoL update that should have been given to everyone even in a limited amount.  If it was restricted to private worlds I wouldn't care but free movement between private and public worlds does create an issue. 
---
However this is considered a minority issue when the vast majority of posts are complaining about the price. Never mind it is comparable to any other server rental price.  And you literally get $16 in atoms a month totaling around $195 worth of atoms a year and it is completely optional.
---
Or complaining that they can't easily mooch off friends buying the subscription.  Because for some reason the idea of having to pay for an optional service offends them. The day their parents stop renewing their netflix account will be a real shock to them I'm sure.
---
Worth a shot
---
Ya I've been taking a break for about 3 months. Just comeback when Wastelanders comes out. You dont have to do the subscription. Would still like the ability to host my own server but I'll come back for Wastelanders.
---
I have to agree with you on this one. I am really happy Bethesda finally came out about what they want to do with FO76. That is definitely on them, they shouldn't have kept their players in the dark for this long. They should have been clear from the start. They weren't and that is on them.
---
Going forward they need to be open and clear about their intentions just like my other MMO Lite games (Destiny 2 &amp; Warframe). Both games don't hide things from the players. If you want to pay to skip grind you can and they are very open and honest about that. Destiny 2 even went f2p recently.
---
The Destiny players are still getting to grips with this new model and the reddit sub has a few outcries but in general since Bungie has been open about the approach the response has been ok.
---
Going forward I hope Bethesda stays open about their intentions. It may cost them players but at least players can make an informed choice. Bethesda should state it like it is, they want money first and they will going forward have 2 tiers in the game. The sub tier and the free tier. With the sub you get extra advantages. This is very much inline with other MMO Lite games and even bigger MMO games.
---
You crafted in abandoned bog town workshop? So you left lucky hole and instead of going to your camp, you went to a workshop to break it down? Breh, that's really suspect since lucky hole is one helluva distance from bog town.
---
What problems are fixes being sold for?
---
Meh. Mistook some others who seemed offended I was playing. Read it as 'why you playing this after that bullcrap'. 
---
So was arguing that while it was bs not to knock those who did enjoy it. A counter to what IMO viewed as 'QUIT HAVING FUN'. 
---
I'll take the L if I misread but was my take on it
---
1. Because I enjoy the game.  
---
2. The world is still incredibly beautiful and wonderful to explore, there are new things I'm still discovering
---
3. I like experimenting and trying to gather the gear for various builds. 
---
4. None of the things they offered are worthy of my disdain.  The repair kits didn't break the game, the fridge didn't break the game, and a premiums service for junk and servers won't break the game. 
---
5. Some of the things people are saying are lies are not actually lies (such as having to pay for private servers) if you go back to news from October 10 2018, before the game launched we were told it was going to be a cost.
---
I played A lot of FPS games. Every Fallout. This is not really A bad game. Just needs A lot of work to make it right. In comparison to the others A 5 due to excessive bugs and Bethesda's failure to address many of them. In their defense they have fixed many but just keep breaking it with every patch. Much of this could have been avoided with A public test server.
---
Idk about an 8, yeah, ton of fun but the bugs can be frustrating.
---
Because he is their spokesman?  And because they haven‚Äôt fired him?
---
No doubt, but I don't think anything will come of it. I'd love to be wrong though.
---
They do know how to fix it. If you upgrade your subscription to their Platinum Failout First Premium Unleaded Plus "It just works!" teir, they'll happily update the fix at the simple low cost of adding more bugs to the game.
---
Well, a lot of people have previously bailed on the game. I will still play the game for the few things I still want from it. But, when I saw the $100 annual subscription I felt like that doomed the game for many people. However, I suspect there are enough players who will pay for the subscription in order for it to be a profitable game.
---
No need, I smurfed them from the developer's room.
---
Because it's Fallout with Friends and that's actually fun
---
When it comes to people discriminating against something people cannot help? Yup! Guilty as charged! I wear the aspie badge proudly.
---
I imagine he'll go into hiding and remain silent like he did during the ['Great Canvas Shortage' of 2018](https://twitter.com/Fallout/status/1067908200182222850?s=19) and instead just retweet officially sanctioned corporate statements.
---
That‚Äôs what my plan is. Haven‚Äôt touched the game for months now. If Wastlanders is a disappointment, that is when I‚Äôll probably stumble into some more hd space
---
&gt; gilded 
---
you mean gelded right? Its decent game beyond that horrible replacement of an auction house or even those whale heat-seeking loot boxes. mount training is still a joke and so is shards for skill points, I pity those that play on consoles who don't get mods to see shards and cant look up whats for sale on a 3rd party website. hell the infinite material bag from sub is basically FO76's new scrap stash too lol.
---
Fallout 76 a game with absolutely no bugs or glitches, crafted by our Lord and savior Todd Howard, you know the game is polished to the point of seeing our reflection.
---
like literal farms, you can capture every workshop, make them produce fusion cores and scrap and food and ammo and whatever forever.   
---
And like, at one level this doesn't give you much of an advantage in fallout 76, because there is very little that even unlimited resources gives you, but like, there being zero meaningful endgame isn't a thing that should be used to forgive direct pay to win. Like you don't win anything because there is nothing to do in this game, not because that isn't a massive advantage.
---
A 1 when that item was your fav legendary.
---
I mean alot of fallout players might not be fans of final fantasy being 2 complete different styles but I'm not against people playing other, more better games.
---
Well this isn't a content update. And they haven't made you pay for a content update yet. So. "Welp" back at you.
---
So, what you're telling me is that:
---
1 no matter what they do you'll still be here telling people everything is ok.
---
2 you're braindead.
---
A QoL update......... riiiight. ahahahah
---
Oh okay, welp if ya decide to start back up again, I'll be happy to help. Been trying to do washout but even with the map, we seemed to have an issue finding enough code, usually only two get found, any tips?
---
Didn't read all of it but I know what you're talking about. Since they did meat week and said they took the servers down for "stability issues" and wouldn't post any patch notes, I'm all kinds of lagging. Not anything different for me after yesterday though.
---
Based on performance, I could probably host all of the Fallout76 servers in virtual machines on an old Dell Proliant I have in the basement.
---
Okay i chuckle'd
---
Sure but the fact that it's even a thing is a failure on BGS
---
Neat.
---
If you two are on PS4 I'm always down to team up! I usually can get by communicating to others via emotes so it could be worth a shot :)
---
I honestly don't give a shit about private servers since bugthesda seems to be just selling out anyway and don't give a rats ass about the fallout franchise or its fans. Mods would be the only cool feature but that's not gonna come from generosity on Bethesda's part and will just locked behind a bigger paywall. 
---
     I'm not trying to hurt the company by cancelling the subscription but just think that what's in the subscription should've been in the base game from the start. Let's see if Bethesda is foolish enough to have a refund purchase option for your subscription and then deny it even if you don't spend the shit atoms or use the crapass private server or don't even wait 5 minutes after purchase to refund your money. 
---
     Not to mention that they said on their website that you get to keep said shit once the subscription is over, except the scrap stash box or server. My purchase refund is pending but from what I know of others doing this they have been refunded and so will I.
---
I haven't played in a while. What's the matter with a refrigerator?
---
You didn't store any bulk plastic...
---
As far as I've read, they did not.
---
u/Aten_Ra
---
Pretty much. They'll hop on here to have a good whine when something like this happens, then a few hours later when they're over it they'll hop back on here to flame anybody without their tongue plastered to Todd's chocolate starfish and then it's back off to go spend their pocket-money on the atom store. 
---
People can say what they want but it'll never change. I honestly think if they slapped a 40 dollar price tag on Wastelanders a lot of people on here would buy it.
---
Did you buy it and reviewed it yourself?
---
How much did Todd pay for you to suck him off?
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm worried about happening lol
---
I KNOW THIS! IM SAYING I HAD NO FUCKING WARNING THAT IT HAD BEEN CONTESTED! I JUST FUCKING DIED! THATS ALL I SAW
---
I checked after I read this. Looks the same to me. Maybe you had only traveled there at night? Certainly creepier at night.
---
Kk
---
No, still is in game for you, you can just only remove scrap and not put any back in.
---
Her name is Chally, and loading in risks game breaking.
---
Me too.
---
I'm going to miss my house in the Ash Heap with its race car beds.
---
So many auto-fellating losers on here, defending Bethesda
---
Fanboys make for excellent guinea pigs, keep buying, let us know how it all works out for ya. üòÜ
---
Yes all the events still spawn
---
Yeah you dont get a warning since you never owned the workshop. It's a work around folks have been doing for months to farm folks.
---
Wow, even if you haven't claimed it? I had no idea, I just learned something. What a strange game mechanic, would have thought at least you'd have to be the workshop owner, or one of your team members.
---
Makes workshop areas really toxic and to be avoided.
---
Complain all you want, just don‚Äôt give a dime to this ass wipes!
---
$13 dollars...that was it.
---
You should have subscribed to fallout 1st. Can‚Äôt be killed in pvp on your own private server.
---
Thanks. I'm running low health build with BE Lever and be handmade.
---
I completely agree, but you can‚Äôt really blame people for trying to hope that something works in this game
---
Did you ever join a private server after placing junk in the scrap box? Or Did you use another players scrap box at any point?
---
My first gold thank you!
---
Yeah, the disk maybe üòÇ
---
Yeah, it is kinda vicious. 
---
At the same time, I think a lot of people feel betrayed, which is a good reason to be upset.
---
You don't actually lose anything. It's literally a display bug.
---
What
---
After everything that's happened, we really can blame them though. Not sorry.
---
Here is post from a [SKSE developer](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/av4f5f/skyrim_together_is_stealing_skse_source_code/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) when the whole thing happened.
---
Jesus have you ever played an actual good game in your life?
---
Scumbag
---
Must have seen you on the map and tried his luck. This vindicates my playing the game constantly crouched with 3 sneak points. Slower to get around but obviously safer.
---
Yep. You dont even have to own a workshop to get ganked in one.
---
One more k and thats racist
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying. But don‚Äôt u fucking come at me like that. But I wouldn‚Äôt be calling BS on everyone about this if it wasn‚Äôt at least semi true. I‚Äôve never heard anyone complain about paid subscriptions before. Idk if u know this, all Paid subs r fucking pay to win. ARK, ESO+ and the list goes on. But NOOOO we all gotta hate on Bethesda don‚Äôt we. Cause that‚Äôs what everyone else is doing, isn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs what gets likes and upvotes isn‚Äôt. If u truly don‚Äôt like the game or u HONESTLY think it‚Äôs some excuse for a cash grab then I respect u for that. But the fact is ik half of u probably don‚Äôt even really care that much, or you‚Äôll probably forget in a week or in a month. I‚Äôve read the ‚Äúsame post‚Äù 100 times already, but paraphrased by 100 different redditers. And they all have close to 1000 upvotes!
---
How can u guys not see through some of this shit? 
---
You know what? You wanna call something shady how bout u look at this fucking community rn. All the same plastic people writing the same review to (most likely) get likes instead of getting satisfaction. 
---
NEWS FLASH REDDIT!!! LIKES WONT GET U ANYWHERE IN THE REAL WORLD! So take some hard to swallow pills, put on your skeptical spectacles, and try to see through some of this BS. Not even for the game just in general. U wanna make a change? I got a challenge for u 21st century take your friends out. Hang out all night and then... Don‚Äôt post it on Instagram. Save some moments for yourself instead of looking for acceptance from other people that, surprise-surprise will forget your ass. And will never know u
---
This is good.
---
I enjoyed both modes. Tbh Bethesda hasn't and didn't give any of the modes enough attention.
---
People are really stupid.   You realize anyone on your friend's list can join without you knowing and are likely looting an killing without the owners knowledge.
---
Also, mobs fight each other.
---
Remember when they said players could not have larger storage due to problems with servers? Ya now that they can charge you a sub for it, it's magically no longer an issue.
---
Holy shit this is hilarious. Bethesda had it coming
---
Prob are ordered to shut up, not fan the flames by deleting everything and duck&amp;cover at least until halloween
---
Your point falls really really flat when you realize that most sales of skyrim and fallout 4 came out of consoles
---
You know... the platform that does not allow modding?
---
Yes all events spawn. I did uranium fever and sons of Dane for the first time in months last night. Was hella awesome to farm sons of dane with out anyone bothering me.
---
I find it hilarious how some people are so blinded by their love of some games that they become naive to what‚Äôs happening right in front of them.
---
K
---
Me too, 76 is going into the "dust collection", may dust it off again, or not.
---
It was surprisingly stable for the past 2 weeks or so to me, even during SBQ fights, but it all went downhill since yesterday. I think I barely clocked 1 hour played in this time period.
---
‚Äúhuge‚Äù
---
ü§°
---
Wait, what? It sounds like you DO agree with me friend. I literally said things should be reasonably priced, and $5 for something that took 15 minutes to make I would not consider reasonable. 
---
I definitely agree unregulated capitalism is bad. People think it's "freedom" when in actuality it's screwing over the free people because it benefits the stupidly rich the most. Nothing is wrong with being rich, but getting more rich at the expense of poor people is the problem, definitely.
---
Oi mate
---
You did well to mine 2000 lead from lucky hole, I usually get about 400 with excavator PA on.
---
I was expecting the sub to be private, kinda like a blizzard move. BTW blizzard is back and the sub is Hong Kong infected. That a good thing. Awareness is good.
---
$20/mo makes you a whale? Bethesda really sucks at the micro transaction game if that's the case.
---
I've known people that regularly spent $1k each and every month (for years) paying to win in free to play games. 20 bucks a month doesn't make a whale. That's even below casual spending for some games.
---
Whop whop, that's the sound of da police
---
Lol that if you have no one in your friends list
---
That would do it to be sure.
---
Amen... say it again.
---
Its only for junk items. I'm sure there is a difference between item types. Plus it doesnt seem to be fixed. Nor has it made a difference to people with mule characters.
---
u/Valseek u/Lady_Devann I know you guys are MIA rn but this is incredibly upsetting
---
Thanks for the heads up, will be more careful in the future.
---
I just saw that they are saying the scrap is still there and that it is just a display issue, hopefully you didn't lose anything and you will be able to still use it.
---
I tried running it on my 2nd computer, no difference.  I‚Äôm sure the support guys have no idea what to do.  You have to think they‚Äôll do an emergency patch and compensate us somehow. If they don‚Äôt compensate us, they are shunning their most dedicated customers who are willing to pay extra money.  I just don‚Äôt see how the game survives that unless this only happened to very few people.
---
Stop judging people for doing what you love and enjoy.
---
Lol people actually paid for Fallout 76
---
Dude you are so wrong its hilarious and scary. All the stuff they added has been talked about before launch or seen in data mines. The new infinite junk stash was a mod from Fo4 made by a player. And the tent is simular to a player made mod also. These are not new ideas
---
They also said there would be no subscriptions but here we are. Just because a corporation says something doesn't mean it's true. Google pete hines private servers and take a look for yourself. Two interviews i know before launch talking about how private servers might work and he even calls them private worlds in one. 
---
Again, not wanting to argue but like what your thinking just isn't true and the proof is easy to find. I really hope you are messing with me
---
Good survey. I love that you got the scrap boxes thing in there
---
&gt;A QoL update......... riiiight. ahahahah
---
How much junk do you need? I usually have between 60 to 100 of every junk type at any given time. That is more then enough to keep my weapons and armor repaired.   The only junk I run out of at any given time is steel. And that is only when I'm mass producing my 5.56 ammo. And that is because I usually make around 1k at a time.
---
It is a QoL update the same as combing all vendors into a single cap pool rather then half a dozen ones.
---
World spawn containers are persistent for a set time after each character change. Meaning you can transfer items between characters in complete privacy. Had this work for me multiple times yesterday. One with over 1000 lbs of junk.
---
There is a better therm than slippery slope.
---
They are using a [salami tactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salami_tactics).
---
I use Salisbury on my main. Good point.
---
Aussie Aussie Aussie
---
lmao ,
---
WE WANTED local private servers, i will run it on my pc and run my game offline!
---
I dont really understand people that still play this game,  but for it to be your favourite?! How is it even possible. Especially considering the amount of truly great games that came out this year and last.
---
No, I just understand basic economics.
---
Yea I'm sorry Pete is a douche. He constantly defended FO4 when it had issues.
---
what do you mean losing companions forever bit?, You mean on survival or the bug where you lost them for that playthrough?. Also 76 are not pretty close and I'll tell you why in a bit, Yes NV had bugs at launch thanks to Bethesda rushing them and also I don't know why you give bethesda such a light tap on the wrist when it comes to 76.
---
You compare 76 to NV in the bug factor and measure them up to pretty close, I'm glad you liked the dlc and that you enjoy NV but 76 surpasses NV by a long shot, the bugs that bugged fallout 4 transferred over to 76, the enemies wouldn't have the right animations or move like they were supposed too, It wasn't a rushed game, I just think it was a half ass game that they just thought "It just works" and gave it to us broken.
---
Honestly? Game is 6 but its managed by a 3 team
---
Agreed, they should have been clear upfront. If they from day one said FO76 is a MMO Lite with MTX and a premium paid for service to fast-track grind then players could decide upfront.
---
I would still have jumped on it since my favourite genre is MMO Lite (Destiny 2, Warframe &amp; ESO). Fallout 76 replaced ESO for me. I really enjoy my MMO Lite in a fallout universe.
---
Also if they were honest from day one they would have wasted less time fighting the player base to try and convince them this is not a MMO Lite game with MTX, RNG and paid skip the grind services.
---
It would also have made it clear that FO76 is not Fallout 5, it is a MMO Lite game in a fallout universe just like ESO is not Elder Scrolls, it is a MMO in an Elder Scrolls universe.
---
Bethesda lost my fucking respect with Fallout First. I have tried and tried to defend them when I don't even enjoy 76 atm. 
---
That's pretty much impossible now. It's just fuck up after fuck up huh?
---
I have yet to have a workshop contested that I owned in the hundreds of hours I have played, and as far as scrap goes, I only use it to craft ammo, something that is extremely easy to come by in the game. It will save me maybe one play session where I won‚Äôt have to devote entirely to farming lead and steel. So anyone trying to make a point that it is pay to win has no leg to stand on. And this is not content nor dlc nor a season pass so technically it was more of stretching the truth then a blatant lie.
---
Or, you know, they  could hire QA people who actually know how to test games instead of being a bunch of knuckle-dragging troglodytes.
---
No buy FF
---
Once again, innocent until proven guilty
---
How do you know this?  All my junk has been gone since 1pm.  I had thousands of steel, acid, etc.  all gone.  How do I fix this ‚Äúdisplay bug‚Äù ü§î
---
Bruh Moment.
---
I don't think I've seen that.
---
I kinda want that though, a last ditch attempt that proved to be one of their greatest releases of all time.
---
It's not pay to win imo. You get extra storage, so what? The only thing that would do to change my gameplay is I would start hoarding stuff like in other Fallout games. Besides all of that, PvP isn't even mandatory in this game so I struggle calling any advantage you have in PvP a pay to win scenario. It's paying for convenience at best, and I don't really have a problem with that.
---
Maybe its just where I'm older, but I don't understand how someone doing something with there own money makes them deserving of getting screwed over.
---
That seems...overly hostile, but okay.
---
Ahahahhahahahhahaha
---
Bethesda replied to this on it's page. Your stuff is still there but you can't see it. If you craft should have the items available. Visual bug... Mystery box
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/6htT-aVJup4)
---
Assuming your friends aren‚Äôt dicks lmao.
---
Do you think it cost Bethesda anywhere near $13 per subscriber to implement first? One month of first is almost 25% of the original launch price...  Did first cost anywhere near 25% of the base game development to create?
---
Let's be generous and say Bethesda accounted for only 10% of the player base would sub for a month. Did it cost anywhere near 2.5%?
---
Not to mention there are people who subbed for a year.
---
You are in the minority. Reddit makes up only a small fraction of the population that plays F76, but you guys still seem to think you're the authority and majority here.
---
Blatantly sexist.  Rule #4.
---
Is it an advantage to have more freed space in your stash or not?
---
A QoL update would be a better pipboy UI.
---
I got 1500. A friend of mine didn‚Äôt need it but ran in and gave me his 450+ ore. I smelted down what I had from acid (300) and made about 2000 lead. I could still craft another 1000 but I need the acid back
---
I'm totally not placing my stuff in a world container. My net is iffy at times and I'm not losing my junk cause my net flatlined
---
LMAO
---
Yes, I do largely agree with you. But, I'm apparently able to rationalize supporting the continued existence of this game for a while. They should price these items significantly lower. 
---
If they tier Wastelanders, I'm done.
---
I mean yeah coz i'm not playing anymore
---
Didn‚Äôt you hear? The patriarchy has fallen. Get used to ineptitude.
---
That's always how it was going to be. Not one single person thought they would be modding in ammo and guns.
---
No sane persons at least. It's an online game.
---
It was a 3.
---
I bought it for $10 last weekend and found myself having way more fun than I thought I would. And just when I was starting to talk to a couple of friends who'd been burned before about trying it again as a group, this got announced. For every step forward Bethesda takes, they do a couple of backflips back.
---
I couldn't find it either
---
Get wreckted u scrub. You bought into this bs and now u deserve all the bugs u get. I rly hope u get the character deletion bug.
---
I wish I could emote.
---
Because it encourages them to keep doing it, and those of use who expect a complete product for $60 keep getting broken, unfinished messes.
---
NV story-wise is a piece of art, It has replay-ability, Now do I go around judging people calling them stupid or ignorant and arrogant while I sit on my high horse, no. Fallout 3 to my taste wasn't a good game, the combat was pretty cringe worthy and the story was meh. NV the combat was also cringe worthy but yet the story excelled, it put you into the role of not a vault-dweller but some random dude that got shot and along his journey to revenge meets up with heavy choices, definitive friends, and in a war between right and wrong. It was so interesting the playthroughs you could do or end up doing by just playing the game the way you wanted. The story did captivate me more then 3 and way better then 4.
---
Joys of mobile friend
---
It's not like Bethesda hasn't butchered the lore, gameplay, franchise, or the good will of its fans. These are things that should have been added to the base game from the very start or even a little later after. You're saying I'm a scumbag taking from the company when that same company has has taken into note what people requested in game and then charged a ridiculous amount of money for said requested items. Wake up dude, Bethesda, and Zenimax have investors they want to keep so there gonna keep pushing this shit, even if that means metaphorically killing off this franchises fans.
---
LOL, thank you!
---
this guy must be quite the fucking watercooler talk king on bethesda right now
---
I'm on mobile?
---
It's October, my dude.
---
It's a bug people have been experiencing with the scrapbox.
---
I got a physical product.
---
Its a product. Not a service.
---
Also, common parlance is actually a legal thing, if you ask a gamer what a private server means in regards to video games, I am sure 99% wont say, something you rent access to. They will say, something I can run and play locally with friends.
---
Edit: Sorry, what date did they first say the servers would be a paid service? as I am looking at all pre-release news articles and can't find that quote.
---
ü§î
---
It's okay Cakeski we have your address on file
---
I‚Äôm willing to bet that you regularly buy things that I think has no value. 
---
The difference between you and I is that I don‚Äôt care what you spend your money on.
---
You're just in the wrong sub bro lol

No witch is a bitch isn't it friend
---
ü§Ø found it. I havent emoted in a while, forgot it's on another page.
---
Good to know...  now to see it I can squeeze out that many atoms before it leaves
---
Just means ur simple
---
STOP BUYING THE MICROTRANSACTIONS!! 
---
It‚Äôs becoming an absolute joke now. There are people on this subreddit even defending this new subscription service.
---
Yeah, I lost all my junk today too.  No response from my ticket either.  You‚Äôd hope they do an emergency patch ASAP.  It‚Äôs seems really stupid for Bethesda to screw over the few people willing to pay $13/month for this!
---
I actually enjoy the game. I have done all the quests but I enjoy the vendors, finding new things, playing with other people. I dunno, this game at a basic level is pretty fun and simple.
---
Son of a bitch!
---
It is reasonable to have the servers cost money. It is not reasonable to bundle it with other features and sell it as a monthly subscription out of nowhere.
---
I don't have any data to support this, obviously, but what we're getting with these servers is essentially 1/3 of a server. 8 people connecting to the private server means that one private server is worth 3 regular full servers. I'm going to take a wild guess that it doesn't take 13 dollars or whatever it is for the private servers to offer that service.
---
In other words, you're paying them a monthly fee for 1/3 of a server and the privilege to buy Atoms from them. The convenience features are thrown in to make you want to buy it/not want to cancel it. It is the same shit that a lot of games do, including ESO by Bethesda's sister company.
---
You're  a witch
---
Well shit
---
Maybe false advertising?
---
I really think emojis are an evolution in the way we communicate no jk ü§≠
---
Well. Learn something everyday. I heard (when it works) you can access in adventure, you just can't add to it.
---
Well, they control the platform and they're selling it players that have spent to last couple of years buying every bowl of shit Bethesda crapped out for em. They know their market, and their market is chock-full of suckers.
---
Wack! That's the only thing I would look forward to
---
I am üëÄ

"It's all a joke! Everything anybody ever valued or struggled for... it's all a monstrous, demented gag! So why can't you see the funny side! Why aren't you laughing?"
---
A slippery slope is not necessarily a good argument all the time.
---
Slippery slopes are easy to avoid, as long as the people at the head are aware of the risk of a slippery slope.
---
Bethesda, either isn't, or doesn't care.
---
Oh sweetie, I am so sorry to hear that the trogladite morons have done this for you. My fiance has suicidal thoughts and is autistic, and he is sat here in tears because of this. If you enjoy 76 that is awesome! We love it too. This subreddit and the wider community has some violently toxic people. This may not be much help, but enjoy what you like, and when you can celebrate it.
---
Leave this community, you don't need this disgusting behaviour towards you. May rainbows surround you in protective light.
---
I play all these games "alone" but i just enjoy the world building. It's a plesent suprise when someone comes by and acts weird or hostile. Or super friendly. It's not the thing for everyone i agree. But hands down the most fun i have had in gaming was wild and weird shit people do while im making steaks to eat and looking at shit.
---
I don't buy games at all anymore if there is not a multiplayer component. I need that dopamine when im not sure about someone but take a chance... And sometimes get shot in the back.
---
üê£
---
Nah fine print is bulletproof i looked at it a little bit
---
I guarantee that they‚Äôre still making millions from that Atom Store. 
---
I can‚Äôt believe people are buying that overpriced crap. They‚Äôre the people that are killing modern day RPG‚Äôs.
---
There‚Äôs zero way that these are servers on ‚Äúmetal‚Äù - each server is just a dynamic VM instance that‚Äôs spun up to accommodate the daily ebb and flow of player logins.
---
The fact that each public server instance supports such a low quantity of players to start with is our biggest clue, and making it so that private servers support just a quarter of that means that they can run many more instances on the same host machines.
---
I‚Äôve not done any traces to see where our network traffic goes, but I wouldn‚Äôt be the slightest bit surprised to see it all running in a subset of localized AWS cloud servers that Zenimax leases space in from Amazon.  The infrastructure is already out there and being used for the same purpose by thousands of other companies, and it‚Äôs cheaper and more reliable than running their own server farm.
---
What do you mean irrelevant? At this point you have two kind players in fallout 76. The First category and the second category. Do you know what does that mean for the community? Did you ever played any other game with paid subscription?
---
My ex had a mystery box
---
Yeah, that's understandable, and I'm able to rationalize the discontinue of support for a game that doesn't deserve support. I was done before the game came out, I don't understand people that where it took the Subscription Crap Service for them to be done with the game, and I really don't understand people that aren't done with it after that, but if they enjoy the game and don't spend money or don't mind spending money on stuff they should've been given for free, then that's cool and I have no problem with anyone playing or enjoying a bad game.
---
Was an official statement from Beth. Have you tried crafting since then? Maybe it's not the same error for all?
---
Ssshh - there's your silence
---
sounds like most peoples view
---
Imagine still playing this game when The Outer Worlds is out OMEGALUL
---
This isn‚Äôt DLC you dub.
---
I love interacting with others, i was a huge dick once and contested a workshop with a level 18 while I was level 50 and killed him a few times. I messaged him sorry and he was super cool about it, like nothing I‚Äôve ever seen. We even decided to hang out and I helped him get the excavator armor
---
I have. I wanted to read it. Annnnnd it is gone.
---
The fact that you knew Bethesda‚Äôs greed and incompetence and you still bought into the subscription service, makes me happy. 
---
You deserve it
---
Edit: looking through the subreddit and seeing so many people buying it, makes me really sad for the future of gaming.
---
Only if you agree with the outrage mob
---
Private servers running smooth
---
It's not a visual bug tho. That's a flat out lie. Cause if it's a visual bug, its visually fucking up the system to cause its repeatedly telling my buddie he doesnt have the components that were once in his scrapbox
---
Nope.
---
While it is fine print, not all fine print is legally binding. Maybe this will turn out to be. I'd think the VP of Marketing &amp; PR's own publicly available repeated statements would hold more weight though.
---
No. God you people are malicious.
---
Justify it all you want... You're still a thief
---
I have seen others explain this.  Unfortunately, now I have one character from my 3 accounts that has all my junk and I can‚Äôt pass it to my other characters.  It gives me hope that it will be fixed eventually though.  I wish all the junk was on my main crafting guy.  Oh well, at least I have hope now.
---
Plus what a lot of the complaints I've seen are also about how Bethesda has taken the "It's our way or the highway" approach, a lot of other games generally give you the ability to host private servers yourself but Bethesda knows if they do that no one will buy their shiny subscription service so they're not allowing that.
---
I remember back when they first mentioned the whole private servers thing I guessed the moment they said 'offer a service' that it was going to be Bethesda-only hosting, on this subreddit you obviously had the 76 defenders disagreeing and saying how they're sure Bethesda will allow both because they believed in Todd and Hines with the same zeal as [the Germans who believed in 'Der Fuhrer' and the promise of Endsieg in May 1945.](https://youtu.be/EJDmA2Fk--4?t=27)
---
Oh wow! You're a trogladite aren't you? I can guarantee my nephew is smarter than you are anyday. I have lived with this kind of discrimination my whole life, and while hearing that you think a child should be killed because it's different..... I have one word for you. N**I.
---
I'm a 1st member on PC and even in private I'm facing lag for the first time ever. Not just like server lockup which has been common, but like fps drops and lags that have had me killed in pve situations a few times now since the update.
---
Don't hate because I said I'm a F1st member, this is my primary game and I enjoy the atom discounts if nothing else. I just was giving context that even in private it occurs.
---
That's a baseless claim. It happened to me and they are correct, I can still use all of my junk for camp building, crafting, and repairing even though it shows that I have nothing.
---
I started Fallout with Fallout back in '98. Fallout 3 was to me the greatest experience in the Fallout universe. I can still remember how the forums freaked out in 2000 when rumors started that the fallout after fallout 2 will be a 3D first person shooter game. People lost their minds! How can the next fallout be 3D FPS, that isn't fallout, fallout is isometric!
---
Anyhow Interplay (or its parent company) went under and Bethesda got the rights and made Fallout  3. Loved it. Anyhow, good memories. Hopefully the next Fallout in the mainline will be more to your liking. Also hopefully you got a few good hours out of FO76 to at least break even on the money spent.
---
Lol, I am NOT Todd.
---
Are there any genuine lawyers who can explain how these constant statements and blatant lies aren't false advertisement?
---
I would be sued if I promised lifetime maintenance for a car and then 12 months later introduced a subscription maintenance fee; so how is this any different?
---
üëç
---
A lot of people,  myself included,  wanted to check it out.   Sort of a one and done.
---
Edge posting from the person in the Fallout 76 subreddit.
---
So funny when people put this slant on it.
---
How about you start a public action lawsuit or something &amp; see how you go.
---
If your not willing to do that, then just stop.
---
AKA naive.
---
i really doubt it, if it tried for whatever reason, it will probably come down to is he speaking as himself or on behalf of the company.  which would be near impossible to prove either way
---
That‚Äôs above their pay grade.
---
&gt;PROVING that an UNLIMITED SCRAPBOX IS POSSIBLE IN A PUBLIC WORLD. So why didn't we have one to begin with?
---
The server stability arguments were 100% lies. If that had ever been the case, stashes should have always been limited to X item names per tab rather than making the game revolve so much around tedious weight management. Or better yet, write better code.
---
No it isn't because you can fit all you need in existing one. I have plenty of scrap,  extra chems and purified waters, 1 of every PA style, several different outfits and I still have 20 to 50 pounds of storage space left to sell legendary gear in my vendor. Even if no one really visits me.
---
Uninstalling felt good.
---
No it's not baseless when it occurred to my buddie just last night and he cant use or create anything because it repeatedly tells him he doesnt have the components any longer. Fuck out of here with baseless. I dont have time for baseless claims.
---
I mean, I've played 35 games (most of them in full) since I got an xbox 4 years ago, before that I played just about every PC game I could get my hands on since 2004. With some Ps2, Nintendo 64, Gamecube and 3Ds games here and there. A lot of them I think were really good, some were terrible. But Fallout 76 is my favorite game, it is the only game that checks off everything on my list of what I want in a game.
---
Indeed, assuming that the slippery slope is *always* a fallacy is in itself a slippery slope!
---
Stop being poor.
---
Hahhahahah what a fucking idiot
---
If you're  not running full bloodied food build, you're wrong
---
Go to craft something I bet it is just invisible like it has happened to others, it is not gone.  People spreading this saying it is gone either is a liar or just didn't know to check out crafting.   
---
Yes it is a bug that needs to be hotfixed, yes it is a visual issue, but it is not anything game breaking.
---
Yeah nah. I am waiting for the next big DLC drop but I log in once every few weeks or so and the bloody workshops are always taken when I log in. Silly people still playing the stupid game ruining my workshop fun!
---
I am on the side of the "outrage mob." You act as though there is no reason to complain. I do suppose ignorance is bliss.
---
Wut a dumbass. If you buy into this system you deserve all the bugs u get. You are the problem with this game. I hope u get the character deletion bug.
---
You become hostile to the person contesting the workshop immediately. They stalked you from stealth, probably waited until you opened your pip boy, and then crit head shot you. Total sleeze tactics.
---
That's the quality of RaIdErs we have now.
---
You don't download the content?
---
evidence or 2nd hand bullshit.
---
You are claiming it happened to a friend. That's second hand knowledge at best. It happened to me personally, I can tell you 1st hand that what Bethesda said is true.
---
You tried giving Bugthesda more money?
---
Nice copy pasta, but no, I dont believe others should have their gaming experience ruined cause they paid for something out of their pocket.
---
I'm not into space adventure but damnit I want Obsidian to do well with this game and stick it to FO76.
---
I hope you uninstall the game
---
Eh fair enough. Doesn't really bother me to take from Bethesda anyway. Back when they made their older games it would've but not now.
---
Im seriously starting to question if you're purposely stupid or just stupid outright.
---
Im pretty sure I don't have to tell you that freeing 400 units of scrap space allows you to store every other shit you want in it, hence, more space.
---
As in, its an advantage to have it, otherwise what the fuck would be the point in marketing it.
---
Do you honestly believe I keep a fucking recorder on while I play this game or something?
---
This sub listening or not wouldn't change what Bethesda does. And I don't get why you care if you get downvoted over it. Bethesda has quite literally done the worst thing they could do for Fallout 76 by charging for a half assed subscription model with definitive P2W elements, not sorta kinda not really like the junkbot, but actual P2W elements.
---
There is no coming back from this, even if tomorrow they remove the whole thing and apologize. They have forever burned down there reputation and goodwill with everyone. We will never be able to trust anything they say now. Like this is it, they literally cannot go any lower unless they just abandon the game entirely. I don't give a fuck about this game anymore and I made this fucking post for gods sake https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d2ikst/cosmetic_only_was_never_stated/
---
My man i'd love to expand on this but most are, especially after sometime from your purchase depending on your jurisdiction. This could be changed if a country or an intergovernmental organization such as EU banned p2w items (utility items fall under the category according to us senate 2018 bill), which would cause beth to breach its ToS contract. However tho my man most jurisdictions while looking into predatory practices like that will leave a door open for companies to make their case as most vidya conglomerates are multinational and pay shit ton of taxes etc
---
So yeah maybe in the future but not now
---
Only thing we can do is literally buy, subscribe on social media, promote etc games like god of war, OW, disco elysium and C2077 - in other words prove these kinds of practices while lucrative in the short term cause harm in the long run (reputation damage)
---
Yes I've killed the game. Not the constant hate by mostly people who have either never played or only played on a mates system.
---
Time to look in the mirror, the only people doing damage are the haters
---
It's crazy to see arguably the most beloved games industry company at the time become one of the most loathed with the release and poor handling of a single game.
---
I'm not saying its unjustified in *ANY* way, I am also a disgruntled buyer.... But man has Bethesda ruined all of their good will.
---
I hope your kids are born without thumbs so my kids dont have to play with anyone of your toxic lineage.
---
No and i said this before. The consumer has changed. Horse armor was a sh*t show, everything DLC wasnt supposed to be. Now its the standard and most people are ok with it. AddOns destroyed gaming as a whole.
---
I def. Believe that. I always just being a jerk. I really do hope this works it self out for you to be worth the additional investment. But with mysterious scrap disapearences and players reporting that the "private server" has areas that appear to have been looted already. I just can't pay again.
---
Surprised, by the looks of you fat discrimination would be a bigger issue.
---
Big oof
---
Well I mean I could let it happen to me, but i already know how to work around it so until the 46 bone shards inside the box disappear, I'm going to go off my buddies word since he has no reason to lie about losing his stuff.
---
Do you have a link to where you saw the announcement?  I don‚Äôt see it on their website anywhere, but I probably missed it.
---
All this was also based on a positive sale projection which obviously didn‚Äôt pan out as they predicted. So instead of cutting the cord on the project they opted in for a different business model. It‚Äôs geared towards diehard players and at 36 cents a day it‚Äôs more than affordable in my opinion. It‚Äôs also not required to play the game and no events or expansions like the upcoming wastelanders are held behind a paywall. So I‚Äôm fine with paying so as long as the game development continues on something I spend so much time playing.
---
You are using strong words. 
---
I would call them "inexperienced".
---
I have 1st , it is 100% a visual bug anyone saying otherwise is a liar without evidence. Many of us that are 1st have this bug, it does not affect anything for crafting or building  it is 100% visual. Again anyone else is a straight up troublemaker and liar.
---
And subscription service doesn't come under season pass or paid dlc lmao fucking betheshit
---
I know. The truth is often harsh. Bethesda has time and time again broken promises and under delivered. Sure, you can have goodwill to believe Bethesda will deliver as they promised. But keep in mind, having goodwill and foolishness is not mutually exclusive. If you don't hand them a punishment or disincentive, they are likely to continue what they have been doing.
---
And so having goodwill at this stage is just plain foolishness.
---
I already went through this with Bioware, so it really stings to lose another company that focuses on modern western RPGS.
---
You are right about that camp budget problem. I will not buy anything due to the fact I have to eliminate something from camp to use it.
---
That's one opinion.
---
I have 1st too but I only keep bone shards in my box  waiting for this glitch to happen.  Calling my friend a liar is bullshit shit seeing as he has nothing to gain from it at all.
---
Yea free private because we are all separated ffs
---
I havent even played the game since about a month after it came out and Bethesda‚Äôs complete tone-deafness just boggles my mind. I mean, it sounds like they probably didn‚Äôt even bother to untether those instances from the normal servers. I suspect they just put in some kind of specific whitelist/blacklist system that routes specific people to specific servers, and left everything else untouched.
---
The first step is recognizing you have a problem
---
Do you know me?
---
Seriously that is one of the most stupid things I've seen written. 
---
I play &amp; enjoy the game
---
If that upsets you somehow - GET A LIFE
---
I am genuinely interested to see what happens over the next few weeks until 2020 when the new DLC drops. I am busy playing something else now but will be back for the big DLC drop. 
---
I am interested to see how many players pick up the sub and how the new influx of funds and also responsibility to paid subs effect the game's enhancements and fixes. I am definitely picking up the monthly sub with the new DLC drop. I think I should be able to have fun for 2 months if the DLC is big enough so basically $26 or whatever for the 2 months to not worry about fast travel and junk storage while I play the new DLC.
---
So, you have Joe Mamas address then?
---
 It boggles the mind. This amount of crookery and incompetence.
---
If you paid for this subscription before the update was finished and the servers were back on and you didnt wait for community feedback.... well.... you deserve it.
---
Skillfully articulated point there. Let me go unsubscribe. /s
---
Bethesda said it's just a visual bug and all your scrap is still in tact. They are working in a fix.
---
Maybe.........."experimental" ?
---
yes
---
Bethesda acknowledged this and said it's a visual bug. They said that all of your scrap is still in tact and they are working on  fix.
---
Not only play since beta, but i paid $300 AUD for the collector edition on release day and brought a second copy so my son and i can play together just for Bethesda to pull this shit.  I am truly saddened by the state of this once great developer as i have been a fan of Bethesda since morrowind and now i will have to re-evaluate ever purchasing another Bethesda game for fear of these ridiculously heavy handed monetization tactics.
---
Yes and no. It wasn't created by Bethesda or hijacked, but rather Bethesda didn't buy the rights to own the domain "fallout first." Some guy noticed this and took advantage of it by making their own parody website.
---
Either way, it's absolutely hilarious!
---
Not really! So I have a little more jiggle than most. I am happy in my own skin and I celebrate my temple. You can call me fat, ugly, and anything else you like....... thing is, I am loved by someone and that gives me strength. 
---
I am so sorry that I was born with a cellur defect.
---
I am sorry that I am deaf. 
---
I am sorry that I am losing the use of my legs. 
---
Guess what? I was thrown to the wolves and now I am the fucking Alpha. 
---
All of this over a fucking game.
---
Funny how some people complain about a 36 cents a day premium account but spent loads of cash and time on a pointless website
---
What a toxic post
---
Okay, either stop with the name calling before I report you, or continue until I do report you, idc. 
---
Second, how am I suppose to screen grab or photo mode someone else's inventory?? He hasn't been on since it happened and I dont even know if he's going to come back so all I can go off of is him saying that he couldn't craft me something cause the game repeatedly said he didnt have any wood or steel anymore and when he checked his box, it was empty.
---
We get the world we deserve.
---
I'm not saying they deserve it, just that it's hilarious and I'm glad it shook out that way.
---
I like how you only named consoles but not games.
---
They aren‚Äôt just fuck ups. Fuck ups mean they‚Äôre not intentional and that they‚Äôre accidental. Anyone who thinks that this entire chain of events that has happened in less than a year after the release is accidental are just getting trolled. The $7 fridge, the canvas bag, the Atomic Shop, the repair kits, Nuclear Winter, screwing over people on the NPC timeline, Nuka Cola Dark, biggest fan ban, the support site doxxing, the release refund lie, the bugs... and now $99 for Fallout 1st. 
---
I think they‚Äôre doing all this because either 1) They want to become the new EA. The ‚Äúbad press is good press‚Äù moniker. Or 2) they really do have an unbelievable amount dedicated fans that don‚Äôt mind getting forked over consistently by this game or Bethesda. Maybe they‚Äôre so far removed from player feedback they actually think all is going well.
---
I picked the game back up in August after the initial release play and I put it back down again in the middle of September because now PVP was getting in the way of having a base. I couldn‚Äôt stop players who were using invincibility exploits from destroying my base. Every day, at least two players would ruin the enjoyability of the game by costing me scrap to fix my destroyed base. The community went to shit from being the nicest online community.
---
[Pray I don‚Äôt alter it any further](https://youtu.be/WpE_xMRiCLE)
---
Never called him a liar. Probably mistaken, just like you.
---
I mean, maybe direct the outrage at the company that fucked you.
---
Doesn't Elder Scrolls Online literally have the same subscriptions for Crowns option? I am failing to see what they put behind the paywall here except some premium currency.
---
Thank you for your help.
---
What better time then now while everyone is upset about a game they like than to make fun of them for being optimistic.
---
Report Bethesda to the better business bureau
---
You have tried to fat shame me. 
---
You have said my nephew should've been "thrown to the wolves" 
---
What else do want to throw at me, my religion?
---
It's hilarious that any of this is a surprise to anyone.  This game was a unfinished mess released as nothing but a cashgrab.  Bethesda has made it very clear for over a year that their customers are cash registers.
---
Sorry for the confusion. The last five items she placed. The owl mask was the only thing bought though before she realized it.
---
So what happens to all the stuff in your infinite stash if you end you Fallout 1st subscription?
---
My only problem is the toxic people attacking others for spending their money on something they enjoy.
---
I've come to a conclusion that this is not a good thing to do. Game gets super easy halfway through 50, around 25-30 and rest is just loot management etc.
---
Why not let people get challenged a bit? Its the only interval they have.
---
Thats a bad word friendüò≥
---
Well I cant tell you if you're right or wrong seeing as he hasn't gotten back on since last night and honestly I hope I am wrong cause I dont have many folks left in the game and I'd hate to lose one over a fucking visual bug.
---
I haven't even bothered loading up the game since this Fallout 1st fiasco.. has really put me off the game currently considering the storm on Reddit
---
You should be grateful i spent so long removing the curse words and name-calling while keeping the message. Can't be uncivil after all.
---
I'm sure it brought loads of joy to the creator, and  a lot of other people too. I for one enjoyed it.
---
Thanks for the thought. The weird thing to me though was she placed it in the dumpster container which I thought would be alright. Hopefully this was a one time thing. Bethesda has enough heat without people accidently selling their good loot
---
Yep. Hopefully they fix this fast. The people who are screeching "Pay to win!" are making everything worse for the people who are actually trying to enjoy the game.
---
It‚Äôs kind of like water torture , now that it‚Äôs gone .... I can‚Äôt live without it
---
License plate: JSTWRKS
---
They 100% deserve this. They ruin gaming for everyone buy telling companies they are ok with paying for stuff that should have been included in the original fee.
---
Give me your shit when you go. Can't take it to outworlds
---
It's just a short tune, if I'm remembering right. One of my friends bought it, not myself. I don't buy atoms.
---
Yep
---
I sent you  friend request
---
Go to your favorites wheel and look down at the bottom of your screen, it should give you a button to press to launch the tent
---
 Where do you people come from?
---
It's hard taking criticism well by a crowd of people threatening to murder you. On the other hand, they are community managers. They can't make changes for you and people still act like they do.
---
Not till midnight for me
---
Brand loyalty is a hell of a thing. It can border Stockholm syndrome.
---
How are ya now?
---
We live and we learn
---
I should be "grateful" that you made sure to make a toxic post that didnt technically break the rules so you could attack people for spending a little bit of their own money on something they enjoy?
---
I‚Äôll be real that gave me a good laugh
---
So? Doesn't change the fact that the market has spoken. This game is here to stay whether you like it or not. It sells. These rage tourists coming into this sub every quarter update to do nothing but shit on the game and the players after A WHOLE YEAR is... well you're right, it's not hysteria. It's medical grade insanity.
---
cry me a river
---
You can change your location to nz
---
Thank you :)
---
You deserve it. Get fucked.
---
Thanks for this. Wish you were PC so I could join you! Love this game and community, sucks some cause commotion though.
---
I mean, slippery slope is how Todd is running this whole show.
---
Not only did they speed right into it but they have completely ignored all advice trying to get them to slow down just a little.
---
Storage box placement and always leaving 200lbs of stash avail. Those were the first lessons i learned in survival. I know people can't game me... But it's ingrained. I get real nervous when my box is gett full still. What if i need to drop some shit in less then 10 seconds!
---
Don't get mad at the people laughing at you for buying a broken product...direct your anger at the company that knowingly fucked you...Bethesda just stealing money for y'all üòÇüòÇü§£
---
Reading that website has brought me more joy than anything Bethesda has brought out lately. Fuck them and their shitty broken ass games.
---
You're welcome.
---
with a catapult üòÇüòÇ idk
---
My optimism about them taking mods out of the picture and having a live service game would mean they would be forced to fix a lot of glaring issues or introduce new game elements mods would normally have.
---
To an extent this happened too, playing the games above 60FPS without issues and ultrawide support come to mind.
---
Honestly It had a funny effect on me. Anger.. but not at fallout, at my main game, FFXIV. After looking over the sub I realized how crazy it is i pay every month and put in over 700 hours into the game and if i don't pay, I cant play it at all, I cant even do the forums. There is no way to earn crysta(Atoms) besides cash purchasing, 18$ wont even buy you a mount, but you can buy one armor for about that price.. Im also held hostage to my house and my fc as if i quit for a break longer then 45 days they get demolished on me and all the work and money is gone on a game where if you loose your housing you're probably never going to win one again. Stash space for all? nah, each retainer(space is a additional sub fee, and if you want the extra 100 spaces from the phone app that's another $5 US a month. IF I pay for F076, I can do just a month, get a armor set, get my atoms(crysta) or farm it in challenges myself, and use extra servers and stash to hold more things i can still access(though not add to) even after I drop the sub. XIV anything on my "retainer extra subscription" is locked from me and unavailable until I pay more money then the sub again to get it.  Really starting to consider this isn't nearly so bad after all.
---
Uh, I come from well here actually. I enjoyed the game, but I can't stand anti consumer practices. It makes me sick.
---
You absolutely can blame people, a lot of people paid $60 for this game at release (myself included). It should have worked then. End of story. 
---
Purchasing atoms and Fallout 1st, if people already felt bad buying the game to begin with, is the literal definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over, while expecting a different result.
---
Damn good eye. You can't store bulk items
---
No im waiting to hear your expaination now.
---
I'd pay to have a pet scorch beast I can ride
---
Well worth the money
---
I mean the people supporting and encouraging them to fuck us over even further aren't exactly innocent
---
You jumped from this shitshow to another shitshow. How's that luck?
---
Hahaha you bought fallout 1st good luck to you dick
---
Supporting/enabling someone or a company when they just continue to do wrong by you is just ignorant assholes.
---
I supported this shit but now it's done deleted and moved on to better gaming experiences
---
Other games that have servers that do not cost a subscription besides the purchase price:
---
PUBG
---
Escape from Tarkov
---
Any CoD game
---
Titanfall 2
---
GTA
---
Hunt Showdown
---
No Man's Sky
---
So many more
---
Games that are absolutely FREE and do not have to charge for server use
---
APEX legends 
---
Fortnite 
---
So half thoae games are from way smaller studios the fucking Bethesda and they can afford servers... Oh and some of those games never cost 60$ out of the gate as well
---
This is the reason why Bethesda implemented this cooldown timer. 
---
They create overcrowded endgame events on public servers and after this they try to sell you the solution for this.
---
Yes. Now we can have a proper discussion about how people who forked over their credit card numbers and therefore encouraged Bethesda to put out literal, objective broken, unfinished products are the ones responsible for turning a once-beloved developer into a money-grubbing monster. Reap what you sow.
---
How about this, take this as a lesson and don't believe what they say from here on. If you fall for their BS again, it's only your fault.
---
Not at all. I always get along with people in game very well. During events, people will revive others and share perks as a group. We share loot after SBQ fights, you always know the blue suitcase at Watoga will be full of plans and spare ammo and even at times cheap legendaries. We came together to kill millions of Scorchbeasts to get the discount.
---
You, and many of the people in this subreddit cheapen the accomplishments and camaraderie that 76 has inspired in a community. What bothers me is that most people in this subreddit dump on the game because of the mob mentality "gamers" have against game companies who, at the end of the day, have a business to run. If you're not profiting, you're losing money, and what Bethesda is doing is justified. They have to make money, and they're being transparent about it. Yet entitled shitstains who think the world revolves around them are determined to troll and bully those who enjoy the game. I've had enough of it.
---
Get the jetpack mod, totally changes the game.
---
Actually, no I'm not Hindu. Kinda missed on that one kid. Anything else? I'll make this east for tou. I'm a Pantheist Pagan, I'm British with Welsh and German heritage. Anything else you want to try? Do you want to attack a stranger online? Go right ahead. Show the world who you are.
---
Sales numbers don't matter as much as they used to (they still matter a lot though) MTX is the main source of income for those companies.
---
Eh, probably. But you're still admitting that they're fucking you, and yet here you still are.
---
This kind of post is just 'Failout First member' envy. Bethesduh deserves a ~~second~~ ~~third~~ another chance, stop being so mean.
---
Fucking A I Hate This Fallout more every day. Even tho i try to love it... its like an ugly db ex girlfriend im still having sex with to try to find some reason to stay....
---
i deleted my comment just now cuz it was stupid
---
but at least we do have confirmation of " Finally, Bethesda admits that allowing friends to join private worlds  without gaining permission from the host player is not ideal and should  be changed. "Currently, players on your friends list can join your  Private World without an invitation,"  
---
they should fix this obviously but at least we got some responce.
---
thankfully i have no friends so w00t me!
---
still gonna try it out. because i have no life and i am fucking pissed off that i didnt get into the microsoft flight sim first alpha test.. so i come here
---
fallout 76 is my alpha test now
---
/s
---
;-)
---
Some people like being in a abusive relationship.  Enjoy your Fallout first subscription!
---
I can‚Äôt speak specifically to AU law but there has been issues where the disc is considered a product but access to the game is a service, otherwise they‚Äôre very limited.  I mean, how does it work when they shut the service down?  You‚Äôll still be able to buy the discs (the physical product) but the game itself (the service) is shut down.  How do digital products fit in.   That‚Äôs why from what I can tell it‚Äôs a gray area.
---
And there are other server rentals - just look at Minecraft realms.  
---
Unfortunately PC gamer updated their article this past week, but I was able to do a google search to find a clip of where back in October 10, 2018 it was announced that the servers were going to be paid for.  
---
There was also a YouTube interview but I cannot find that anywhere anymore - I remember it was one of my biggest issues with the game is the always online and never being able play offline, and the game at some point goes away.  But here‚Äôs the clip from the google search I did: 
---
https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk
---
I'm hoping some of the haters will actually quit, make it a better game
---
Appears to be a reward from the event
---
The idea of Shiva and Kali kicking your backside all around the universe is appealing. Hmm maybe get the Morrigan involved too. Lmao!
---
Name me 5 most played live service games that don't have subs. Oh right you can't. 
---
FFXIV - sub + game + expansion
---
ESO - sub + game + expansion
---
GW2 -  game + expansion + heavy gem shop
---
WoW - sub (for 15 years) + game + expansion
---
The rest top played games are all gasha box fuck fest.
---
This is how online live service games work. Dont you get it by now? 
---
So why is suddenly fo76 the biggest evil incarnated anti christ satan on the planet? 
---
You haters are so delusional it's unbelievable.
---
Except both Skyrim and Fallout 4 have mods for PS4 and Xbox One. Albeit less, but the modding community is still alive on [Beth.net](https://Beth.net), I've used alot of Elianora's stuff on XBone when my PC went down.
---
Entitled, I'm sorry that I expect a company to live up to their word.
---
That makes sense.  The game is literally dead anyway.
---
Bethesda is done trying to bring new players to the game.  Rather, Bethesda is just trying to monetize the shit of the players who are still around.  And once Bethesda has squeezed y‚Äôall as mich as it can, it will shut the shit down finally.
---
Pay to win? The game isn't pay to win lol. With the 1st Sub all you get is a extra camp, a personal server and a scrap box xD 
---
1. The extra camp helps with not dumping caps to travel. 
---
2. The personal server sucks unless you are just farming really since the only good event requires more the just 8 players to complete(Scorch Queen).
---
3. The scrap box is kind of cheesy if it was working fully.
---
But with these 3 addons you don't really get much to really be able to class it as a pay to win. If they wanna harp about it being a pay to win then they can goto WoW and see a true pay to win. On i forgot the 1650 a month of atoms. But that is for cosmetic. I was doing just fine without the update. I hit lvl 105 befor the update and i was doing just great so pay to win my ass if u ask me lol.
---
You are not people. You are morons.
---
Is it entitled to expect a functional and working game at release, when you pay the average release cost of $60?
---
Was it entitled for people who were promised a canvas bag, to get a nylon bag and complain about it?
---
Was it entitled to ask for much needed bug fixes and improvements to this game to get slapped with a paywall after they already paid for the disaster this game became at release and for months afterwards?
---
The answer is No.
---
When I read the update, I immediately thought that the only reason they are doing this is for people to actually buy atoms
---
i shall just put one scrap at a time  in the box and see what happens 
---
at least they did address some of the issues today in comments so hopefully some of it will be fixed
---
Soon (TM)
---
Fallout 76: the tech alpha test you can actually get into (unlike microsoft flight simulator which i didnt! RAWR!)
---
It does. Junk is a stackable item thus requires less storage and computing power to track. Legendarys on the other hand, has condition, efffects, values etc all different values each individual one having to be tracked.
---
If the person gets what they feel is enough entertainment to be worth 43 cents a day then there's nothing wrong with them at all. They are just spending their money on something they enjoy.
---
Do we really want me to name all the games I've played for the past 15 years? I'll name a few I think are really good. My favorite games in the early years were of course Pokemon games, and Runescape. With Soul Calibur 3 being my most favorite game for many many years. Then when I played primarily on PC it was a LOT of Minecraft, Rift, Warframe and trying out indie games left and right. I took a break for a yearish and then got an Xbox, which I instantly played Halo 5 on for awhile, then right back to Warframe which was previously my favorite game until 76. I also enjoyed Diablo 3, Overwatch, Ghost Recon, some Talltale games.Plus I have gamepass and have picked up some free games with gold that I enjoyed but not anything special really. (Human Fall flat, We Happy Few, Layers of Fear, Divinity, Fable) And I did play TESO and Ark quite a bit but I really did not enjoy them and have zero interest in ever playing them again. And I also played a ton of Skyrim and Fallout 4. And I loved them.
---
exactly
---
You just blew my fucking mind.
---
Not entirely. They told me I'd enjoy the game, and I have thoroughly. All this publicity for the game has seen a ton of new players join, and much more activity than I've seen in months. Just today, three nukes lauched on prime in the server I was on in the span of an hour. Honestly the most fun I've had in the game in months.
---
Has he learned his lesson though? There's a substantial amount of people *still* defending this. Bethesda's going to stick around for a good while longer, and it doesn't look like they're planning on getting better, all thanks to whales like OP
---
If you have not paid for the service yet, we will mail the payment directly to the provider.
---
Yeah but... However when you are a loyal fan, and buy the first subscription. And get royally screwed day one... this sucks and I deserved it.
---
Lol that's some serious corporate shilling u just posted. My God it's disgusting people like u exist. Defending scummy practices like this.
---
Also I gotta say if I had unlimited storage for everything I would have every legendary I have ever found
---
To do this we would have to pay 100$ a month. All of us. On top of fallout first subscription of cours.
---
They had a whole town removed from their version of FO3? Where the fuck was the first part of the story then? Megaton is like literally the first place you go. Do you just go straight to Vault 112 then?
---
Just to note:  my scrap box hasn't fucked up yet.   Hopefully it never will.
---
Its not a proper discussion to wish misfortune on someone for enjoying something that you dont.
---
Hiyas I'm on pc , also have Fallout 1st and havent had a issue with finding previously used worlds or with the scrap box. I'm keeping my eye open but I've been rather heavily playing the last 2 days and havent had it happen to me yet.
---
Another broken update? what in the sam hill...
---
I can say ive def got more then $60 enjoyment from this game, and their subscription model is WAY WAYYYYYY better and more forgiving to quit then some of my other games
---
u$s12,99?
---
NO thanks.
---
Kys.
---
So, sorry it's just I'm curious. Do people just hate the truth? Is that why I get down voted on this sub so much? Genuine question I'd love to know, because I love conversation.
---
Just from what I saw in notes.
---
Good patch, bad update.
---
What's really too bad is when they raise the price on these poor guys to be able to customize their server with sliders and shit.
---
I'm not saying its pay to win. Other people are.
---
Steam don't bid for exclusive rights though, if you have a game on steam you can still buy it elsewhere, exclusives are a monopoly, they are the exact opposite of competition
---
BOHICA = Bend Over Here It Comes Again
---
This deal gets worst every time!
---
no u
---
Hi Todd!
---
Just curious, how do  you know the player count?
---
Then leave
---
This doesn‚Äôt take loads of cash. I‚Äôm a web designer. This cost $20 at max when done DIY style.
---
at least they are not deaf
---
but yeah....ya SHOULD have made a way to control WHICH friends can join your private server and which coudnt
---
thats ok i has no friends and without any text chat with the PC version no real reason for me to as i dont use a mic anyways
---
forever alone!
---
Can somebody explain why they arent paying us to beta test this lump of shit
---
They literally admitted to it in their subreddit
---
Some people pay much more than 13$ a month to get pegged
---
There can be more than 1 guilty party
---
Attacking people for spending their money on something they enjoy is what's disgusting. People say "shill" because they cant believe that someone would dare have a different view than them. Its pathetic honestly.
---
HANGING ON THE EDGE OF TOMORROW!!
---
Uh, no I have every right to be here. If you don't like it, that's actually too bad.
---
Scrap : discard or remove from service (a redundant, old, or inoperative vehicle, vessel, or machine), especially so as to convert it to scrap metal.
---
I guess the guy/gal making the scrap box really believe in the term Scarp.
---
I wouldn't support OW. Blizzard has huge ties to China, which is part of the issue of P2W games.
---
At least you didn't vendor one in the first few months like I did. (Well, I hope)
---
That's what all the meth heads say
---
I don‚Äôt disagree that the Scrapbox and Tent shouldn‚Äôt be exclusive to the premium service.  They can include it as a bonus if they want to, but all the of it (minus maybe the server itself) should be made available through the atom store.  
---
I also don‚Äôt disagree that the capacity for the servers should be up to what we normally can have.  If I can go on a server and over time get 23 of my friends on, there is no reason that we all can‚Äôt just join my personal server. It‚Äôs should be the same load on the server (which is all virtual anyways).
---
The second part doesn‚Äôt bother me much since A.) I won‚Äôt hit the 8 player cap anyways since I mostly wanted the personal server just so my buddy and I can play together and B.) the atoms (that I‚Äôd be buying anyways) exceed the cost in value - so I make out ok anyways. 
---
I just think people should be very direct with their feedback and criticism.  If we go back to pre-release news and find things like this clip below that shows they told us the servers were going to be a paid service, then just acknowledge it was unknown and focus on the other things they have said or done. [https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk](https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk)
---
It can be roughly estimated using trophy unlock % among players. Google it and you'll see what I'm talking about because it's hard to explain.
---
What about those of us who never even considered getting fo76 to begin with  and have been happily lurking this subbreddit since day one feasting on the drama?
---
I mean in this case not really. The people saying you got what you deserved aren't deleting your items. Bethesda is though.
---
Well in a sense it's a true statement. Just in a comparison point of view, it essentially offers the exact same thing that ESO's online subscription provides and for $2 less (and more in game currency monthly).
---
Twice I've played ESO (for long stints at a time) and twice I've signed up for the service within 24 hours because it is extremely convenient. I see the exact same convenience in this subscription. It's not necessary, but it's a very nice bonus. As I'm sure someone said, they really need to find supplemental income to justifiably continue work on this game and this is part of that plan. I'd understand all the outrage if it were required but it's not. An argument could be made about the private server aspect (although they never stated whether or not they were charging for them, only that they would be coming in the future), but depending on how that was implemented depends on whether or not it's worth it (pre mods).
---
Ah dang, rule 4.
---
Oh no i wasnt directing it towards you. My bad
---
So basically you came without proof, and secondhand info. You are literally trying to start an issue that does not exist thus breaking the rules yourself. Do not post rumors. No evidence it is just a rumor since there is an official response rebuking you and many 1st players that have corroborated that it is in fact a visual bug. 
---
Hence you are a liar. That is not name calling by the way, a spade is a spade after all.
---
Outer Worlds my man, that other OW i kinda remember is dead:)
---
I mean it's your life.
---
That's like if I warned you not to buy from a shady car salesman and you did so anyway. 
---
The engine alone is 25 years old, how could I not laugh after you shoveled out money just to have a tire blow on your way out of the lot?? It's funny when people do dumb things
---
You'll see
---
My fiance and I love it! For my fiance ¬£12 is a small price to pay to play alone, and not have people nuking our camp, killing us for a workshop, and grieving us....... We may not completely agree with this whole thing, but of people who to pay - great. If people don't want to pay - great. Enjoy the game
---
Also of note is that ESO+ includes access to all the paid expansions while you're subscribed, too.
---
Good 'n you?
---
Nice song
---
So why are you still commenting then, it's about time you moved on &amp; just let it go.
---
Anything else?
---
They probably haven't. As much as I would love to buy Fallout 5 whenever that happens, I know now that I won't purchase it at least at full price knowing what I know now. I'll wait until it's 20$ like the rest of their the games are now.
---
It's a shame, but shit. If that's how they're gonna be. I'm not putting any full amounts of my money into their games now.
---
Don't worry I forgive the offensive things you say like "support bethesda" and "more lootboxes daddy"
---
Why should we feel sympathy for you when you're the one actively supporting the very thing that happened to you?
---
YOU put your blind faith in a service from a company that has notoriously sold numerous players a bill of goods with their buggy, and borderline incomplete game, and the NUMEROUS controversies surrounding said game post-launch both internally, and externally.  
---
YOU support this continued process of releasing content and services that lack quality control despite coming from a AAA company that charged $60 for their game.  
---
YOU earned this. Maybe if you have a bone to pick with anybody, pick it with the company you so graciously put your trust into.  And perhaps if you don't want it to happen again and have people knocking you for your troubles, you should think about how you speak with your wallet next time.
---
Been hearing that since launch
---
It is possible to love playing a game while also being disappointed by the company that made it.  This game is pure Fallout aimed at pure Fallout fans.  If you played a Fallout game for 40 hours (finished story) and then moved on to the next game, you can get the same experience here, but if you played Fallout 4 for over 200 hours and never wanted it to end... this is 76 and why we are still playing.  Core game is fun (but is in desperate need of new content), playing with friends is fun, Nuclear Winter is fun.  The ONLY thing I'm not enjoying is the haters that won't go away, the company that keeps feeding them with poor decisions, and the fucking Mayor of Grafton.
---
Zenimax is the parent company though, they gave Bethesda the funds to make it and how long it'd take to get it up an working. Not fully working just in working condition. The 2 beta tests they did was more than likely a test on how well the servers were working. If Zenimax allowed more time for Bethesda to make their games then we wouldn't be having these issues that have plagued the games game engine for nearly 2 decades. Zenimax wants profits and this is the outcome of what's happening right now.
---
I never understood why Bethesda always got a pass, all their games were bug riddled pieces of shit with terrible combat.
---
Any other developer would have been torn to pieces the first time it happened.
---
Last week i kept seeing same camps over and over again. Game has troubles.
---
I am a console normie and I'm very offended
---
God you're one toxic manchild. I'm done wasting time with you. You're just another bandwagon baby.
---
Hey always got time to respond to sheep üòã
---
I think the idea behind putting the scrap box in the subscription is that because most people wouldn't have the subscription, the scrap boxes wouldn't cause too much strain on the servers. I don't work at Bethesda though so I don't actually know for sure.
---
TBH slippery slope arguments are often fearmongering and assumptive. This is an exception
---
I don‚Äôt play most of those games.   GTAO offers you a personal server where you can only allow your friends to play with you? No Man‚Äôs Sky offers you personal servers you can play alone on?  
---
To the best of my knowledge those games are not allowing you to enter a private server.  
---
On the flip side, you have games like Minecraft, from Microsoft, that charges $10 a month for their realms.  Yes you can have a private server but that requires equipment and maintenance.
---
Right on
---
It was a microtransaction for a functional in game spoilage-reduction mechanic. Basically a new gameplay addition that you had to buy, when they claimed all new features would be free.
---
&gt; Fallout 3 to my taste wasn't a good game 
---
I doubt you or any NV cultist has something called "taste".
---
Cry less. Everyone ends up dead. Should probably enjoy the ride.
---
This misses the key point of the fallacy itself, which is that you can't simply *assume* A will lead to Z rather than stopping at any of the 24 steps between the two. A cosmetic shop, for example, does not necessarily lead to this behaviour.
---
It is a fully reasonable argument to suggest that a negative trend will continue. There is nothing particularly slippery about the slope.
---
tee hee
---
It‚Äôs time to got the Final Fantasy Reborn route and shut it down, and bring it back up a new, better game. Sorry Bethesda, I love 76 and all your games, but you really screwed up again. This time we can‚Äôt defend ya.
---
OP is a little mistaken, I believe they just removed Mr Burke and the chance to blow up megaton.
---
Nah it's pretty justified in this scenario when the company promised you would not be charged for this content. Also constantly told consumers they could not fix storage space due to server limitations but now that they figured out how to monetize it, it's all cool and no problem. This is classic bait and switch scummy corporate practice. If you are not smart enough to realize that then yes you will get attacked on the internet.
---
Once you have proof of an actual support ticket &amp; a response, then please post- till then, just sounds like another hate rant to me
---
Only Burke was gone and you had no option to set of the Nuke on your own. Megaton was 99% intact, just the nuking of the town that was removed.
---
This seems fishy.
---
I scrapped it first. I joined a private server first but never built the scrapbox until adventure mode.
---
#HI, HEAD OF DEVELOPMENT HERE. WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN A JOB? YOU HAVE SOME INNOVATIVE IDEAS THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO INTEGRATE.
---
But you'll all still preorder Elder Scrolls 6 for $120.00 without even waiting for reviews. Oh how quick we are to forget.
---
Just because you had fun, it doesn't mean the situation is not shitty. In this case they are not mutually exclusive. Again, you can have fun with something shitty. It doesn't mean that the said activity isn't shitty. I have to type this out whenever Bethesda makes a mistake, it's a mantra now.
---
Again, just toxic.
---
Your implying people are entitled because they dont share your view on it. Your part of the problem. I get it The 76 horse is beaten to death and turned to a fine paste at this point but your just pandering and extending the beating.
---
I sense a lie here lol üòÇ
---
Is this true for console too?
---
Now I can be happily addicted to call of duty zombies and csgo instead. Hurray!
---
Nah, we're all gonna preorder Elder Scrolls 6 for $120.00 without even waiting for reviews.
---
People rarely learn, even when companies completely fuck them over. Hype culture is strong in the gaming industry.
---
While i am absolutely disgusted by Bethesda recent actions . I figured with as hard as they are pushing this shit they would have properly tested it. Bethesda has honestly become a running joke of a failing company. 
---
Anyone else starting to think the reason Bethesda refuses to crack down on griefers and dupers is because they are hoping to push more people into buying private servers ?
---
Well didn't you know wearing that armor costume makes every legendary drop a 4 star God roll???
---
I'm sure totally winning
---
/S
---
Still not gonna play this game until they give us true local machine single player that we get because of our initial buy-in. No extra money spend, no bullshit.
---
People are actually making the argument that they are entitled to the private servers for free. I'm not implying, I'm quoting.
---
Sorry, I misremembered part of that- they didnt remove the whole town, just the bomb and the npc that gives you the quest where you can detonate it.
---
[Gamespot article](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-de-nuked-in-japan/1100-6200975/)
---
I feel like I did see at least one article that said the town was removed, and I had the same reaction as you lol.
---
Most of the time a 8
---
Are you serious? I literately have proof in my post this is what happened to me, I can even send pictures of everything in my inventory, proof that I bought Fallout 1‚Äôst, proof of everything I claimed. This just happened to me, do you seriously think I need to send a ticket to Bethesda for this not to be a ‚Äúhate filled rant‚Äù? My fucking character is gone man. I don‚Äôt know what else to say.
---
I've stopped playing for almost half a year now-- they shut down survival servers?? When and why?
---
What amazes me, is somewhere, a man is standing up. This post is still here.
---
The fridges were a new gameplay feature (storing food to reduce spoilage) that you have to buy with microtransactions. They previously said new features would be free. That was the ‚Äúslippery slope‚Äù OP was talking about. 
---
Now they added an infinite scrap box, an additional camp, private servers and a highly requested set of armor that costs $99.99 a year.
---
I have no reason to lie nor do I have any reason to continually deal with your bs.
---
I'm a non-player (well, for 76 anyway, but I am an avid fan of the OG Fallout games), I can join in on the fun.
---
From a technical standpoint. Actually, no. You don't. The subscription nor anything from the atom shop is downloaded to your hard drive.
---
I agree the atoms and outfits I agree with but yes the tent and stash should be free.
---
Protest is a right in America, and I encourage it, however what goes on in this subreddit is less protest and more sinister.
---
People were coming back too.  I never left, but I'd take breaks and find every time I did there were huge gains.  The content fixes and additions were working.    It's the nature of corporations though, fuck long term profit... I gotta get this quarter up before I trade to a new company.
---
So it just magically appeared on your PC?
---
Lol im glad people are getting what they deserve. Support a shit dev get shit results.
---
I think people are mainly mad that it's so expensive, that you could have unlimited in past games and that they said that was the reason for server crashing, and that they have the servers already from launch so they're essentially making people pay to run servers that are empty because of their game sucking
---
Someone fill mine out for me, busy playing other games and trash talking this game with complete strangers.
---
Just put Bethesda's a cu#t for every answer, thanks.
---
Its fun as a sandbox. It has that 'explore and ponder; wtf happened to this place' sort of detective feel. 
---
The quests themselves, they are 'fetch' quests, and honestly that aspect sucks, yet they tie in with the exploration fairly well while retaining the actual 'fallout series awe inspiring moments' such as dealing with an impressive bunker or a bizarre manor. The occasional scorchbeast can come out of nowhere and terrify as well. You can also be creative and build a base, and sell things to other people.
---
Like I said its a fun sandbox.
---
No.
---
Looks made up lol
---
I think it‚Äôs less the controversy of the statement, and more the fact that I just want to be able to ignore all of this and enjoy what part of the game I can without my wallet. It upsets and angers me because this game had so much damn potential, but corporate decided to take the game out back and ‚ÄúOld Yeller‚Äù it for a quick buck.
---
I play this game daily. Usually a few hours, sometimes more, sometimes less. The subscription adds some nice features for me, at a cost that is 3 kr (swedish, roughly 30-40 cents US) a day. That is no money. Like at all. I could hardly buy a piece of gum for that money. So no, I do not feel ripped of.
---
Would I have preferred if it was free? Sure! But it isn't. And the game has costs, like offices, servers, salaries for developers, so now I support those things with Fallout 1st instead of buying atoms monthly to support it. Work out fine for me.
---
Well now I‚Äôm having an existential crisis. :/ Although, people should cry when they need to instead of holding it in and maybe there would be a lot less hostility and frustration in the world.
---
*\[Gamer entitlement intensifies\]*
---
If you don't like the service then don't buy it, it's that simple.
---
"That's an interesting strategy, Cotton. Let's see how it works out."
---
And my Axe!
---
Anything else, or are you finished?
---
Hey doesn‚Äôt look like anyone else has mentioned this yet. On his newest video Mr Matty Plays offered to give you a copy of The Outer Worlds on your platform of choice! I‚Äôd take him up on that offer!! [5:18](https://youtu.be/zWVADjk7K8Q)
---
Other than warmind for the story. Takes like an hour to do, but the guns are good, especially the ikelos shotgun. Itll be a while till it comes back into rotation though.
---
If you think the atoms are worth that much, that means you also agree to paying 18 dollars to paint your power armor blue.
---
No. Just, no.
---
Alright fine, I‚Äôll send as many pictures as I can to show this is real.
---
Nothing is wrong with me.  
---
$13 for the private server is nothing.  In any mobile F2P game that type of money spent wouldn‚Äôt even make me a guppy, let a lone a whale.  
---
I enjoy the game, I may take breaks from the game here and there but I still find lots to explore and enjoy in this game.
---
So, I assume you don't agree with what I said in the previous comment?
---
If you aren't raising a ticket, then you obviously don't care, so why should we
---
Thanks he messaged me, awesome dudeüçªüëçüèª
---
You said you lost everything but those pictures show stuff lol
---
Preach it!
---
Lucky bitch üòâ
---
Outer Worlds is live in 9 minutes
---
You're aware that objectively the player count has dropped off substantially since launch, right? Like, they made it $20 fast because of the lack of sales and returns. To think it will come back to launch numbers stronger than ever is so so so flawed
---
&gt;  You can't just extrapolate indefinitely. 
---
To add on here, I think validity in extrapolation depends on if you can identify and/or prove a shared motive.
---
In your first example, there's no proof that the first marriage legalization would lead to the second, because there's no proof that the people who would want the former would advocate for the latter.
---
In the second example, with a corporation, you can kind of extrapolate that a corporation will continue to "demand more" because it exists to seek profit. They'll continue to slide down the slope and push the envelope as long as they continue to increase their profits. 
---
"X company will try to get away with more Bad Things‚Ñ¢ in the future to increase earnings" isn't really a slippery slope fallacy, it's a reasonable hypothesis based on the motivations of the company.
---
Anyone who spends money in the atom shop for fridges or repair kits is part of the reason it got this far. The writing was on the wall but those of us who pointed it out got downvoted. If you buy fallout first, Have fun with fallout mobile, but know that you‚Äôre the reason the gaming industry is doing what it is. Can‚Äôt trust a company
---
lol I'm as paranoid as anybody with the hate rants but that looks pretty legit
---
I did lose everything. Everything I had is now changed to a completely new bugged item.
---
Exactly! That's the whole concept of the game!
---
What? They're games were always bug fest's, with unfinished shallow systems and shit story telling. Bethesda's games looked good only until other studios started doing open world games and have done them 10 times better.
---
I could never play a non-moded. Bethesda game. Mods made those games popular. Not Bethesda's supposed "quality".
---
Almost nothing as in what bugs? Not everyone will encounter the same bugs and yea I've encountered various ones, nothing game breaking but yea I've been here since beta and have witnessed a lot of bugs and also my friends who have encountered bugs. The game was pushed out the door with barely any testing cause it had be pushed out the door. There was no way for them to push the launch date unless they were ready to lose their jobs and waste all their time on developing the game for nothing.
---
Not according to those pictures lol
---
The game has had a tarnished reputation with the majority of people since it was launched. The community is very niche at this point. The people who've stuck by the game and defended it now feel like complete asshats, because they've destroyed any good faith they've built by fixing the game and adding content updates that made it worth playing. They're blatantly milking their players with a subscription model on a game they already paid for and already has a microtransaction shop implemented, which is the only thing getting regular updates. Things like private servers and the scrap box have been asked for for ages, now stuck behind a paywall. On top of that, they don't even work. Private servers have proof of being reused instances of other players and don't have an option to keep people from joining. The box deletes your shit.
---
That's pretty fucking stupid, if you ask me. I haven't touched the game in a while, but now it's just being uninstalled. It boggles my mind that they thought this was a good idea. Bethesda truly doesn't give a shit at this point.
---
Same lmao. It's hilarious though. I never thought Bsthesda could sucker people in to paying for their empty servers but here we are lmao
---
Ohh whoohoo you play on something that cost you more money good for you
---
I actually own a great PC that runs 76 on max but I'd still rather play on x1 just to avoid people like you
---
You people (and yes I mean YOU PEOPLE) make gaming a horrible thing online 
---
PLEASE go away
---
[good for you?](https://youtu.be/mGcHNnI2mh4)
---
yeah 8 years later somebody will dig it up out of context and get you fired over it, so better just not say anything at all
---
No, because they also told us back around Oct 10, 2018 that the servers were going to be a paid service. Here‚Äôs a clip from the news article from google search since PC Gamer updated their article since the update. 
---

I stopped a long time ago, solod and launched my first nuke i ever did, went to fight the queen with the server, server crashed. quit for a while after that. reinstalled to come on to getting attacked by 3 scorch beasts at the same time, uninstalled again and haven't played since.
---
I lost my scrap on one character I was playing on a friends server.  Only other character I built the box on still has its junk fortunately.   I pulled it out til there's a fix.
---
Geez he explained it pretty well. If its true that would really suck
---
i raged for a bit
---
then i remembered i did enjoy the beta despite some of the issues just felt wasnt quite worth the 60 bucks at the time.. now got it on sale plus the first subscription and downloading it now and gonna play tommorow despite the rage.  lol and if they fix some of the issues and all i think it will be fine.  Not perfect. maybe some shitty choices.....but..........i have no life
---
besides now i get to join the rage legit! instead of just some outsider who only has played the beta
---
damn you fallout 76 damn you to hell.........oooh i reached Charleston!....
---
its the game you can feel good about liking and...hating
---
at the same time.
---
I don't think you deserve to lose your stuff but I do think you're a fucking idiot if you bought it
---
The Nazi Germany is the most recognizable historical example of clear-cut unambiguous villainy, so you shouldn't feel all that bad. Sure, their villainy was the most vile ever commited and everything else is small potatoes by comparison, but you aren't implying that this here is just as evil or worse, you're just saying the same slippery slope principle applied there as well.
---
Sorry, I know it's irrelevant to the conversation.
---
I don‚Äôt. I was one of them. I just feel frustrated.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but are you a bit daft? +20 health isnt even a legendary effect you can possinly obtain
---
Yep real /s
---
Yea that‚Äôs a a big if
---
Nailed it bro.
---
So you said you lost everything. I saw stuff. You lied lol
---
Agreed a thousand times over.
---
Underrated comment
---
Yeah, a lot of people are missing it completely.
---
Here's a quick breakdown of a genius viral marketing campaign.
---
Problem: Need to increase playerbase and revenue, while new games (particularly Outer Worlds) threaten existing playerbase.
---
Step 1: Delay new content until after enough time to return playerbase from competitions new release.
---
Step 2: Incite social outrage and increase revenue stream from hardcore player base with subscription only the hardcore will pay for anyway.
---
Result: Fallout 76 trends on every gaming media platform *during* competitions release of similar game, sparking influx of new players curious about the media commotion.
---
Step 3: Release free DLC to return previously departed playerbase- probably paired with *another* viral marketing scheme.
---
Very well played. Very well played, indeed, Hines.
---
A website is like $13 a year and doesn't come with a purchase. You guys act like this was a free mobile game
---
All you can do is message Beth really...
---
Existence is pain jerry!
---
Your a big F
---
You dumb fuck.
---
https://falloutfirst.com/
---
I've said repeatedly I don't agree with the priceing model
---
Unlike most I can say I disagree with dev choices while still enjoying the game
---
Doesn't seem to be a problem for me who didn't buy it. Or the 66% of the NW lobby who is doing the robot.
---
It is your own fault... people like you who continue to open your wallet to greedy business practices are aiding in the destruction of gaming. If you like the game that‚Äôs you‚Äôre own poor taste, but don‚Äôt be shocked when people laugh at you for thinking anything they add to this game won‚Äôt be broken.
---
Um...ok?üòÇ
---
I don't think that's a fair standard to have for someone asking a question
---
Shit I was saying this from the beginning that the whole thing with 76 is a money grubbing low effort cash grab all I got was downvotes. Bout time some of y‚Äôall started to realize lol.
---
Voice your displeasure by buying Outer Worlds and be vocal about how much better it is lmao.
---
Enjoy your sweet sweet karma
---
Dude just ignore the negative people commenting. If something happened to your game you need to submit a ticket with Bethesda. They are the only one that can help you with a problem like you described. Best of luck
---
Oh, I was confused between ore and smelted, fair enough.
---
&gt; Bethesda isn't going to try to get more bad press 
---
If you said that 2 years ago I would have agreed. But now? Now unironically I'm starting to believe they must know how poorly that shit is going to be received and I'm thinking they don't care about any bad press at all.
---
Clown
---
Cool story except it's pretty unfair that if I don't want private servers I have to pay monthly anyway to get quality of life features I was told I would never have to pay for...
---
3 minutes
---
Wow this sub really hasn't changed at all the past year.
---
On a great atmospheric day sneaking around and finding new stuff and places I would give it a 9, no hesitation.  But most of the time the game jumps between a solid 7 and close to an 8. It is a good game, it is just plagued by being made by a team that was handed this with no previous Fallout knowledge and being told to make it in an engine they did not make themselves nor did know well.
---
Thank you! I agree 100% I love the membership (personally don't have it, but my boyfriend does so I benefit from it and experience it second-hand) and I have ZERO problems with any of the extras that come with the membership. It's not P2W, it's not bad and it's not locking anyone out of any content.
---
Don't forget to stop coming to this r/ as well, otherwise you just come off as needy.
---
Because these optimistic people kept ignoring this is not the first time a company has done this and it has happened over and over. And the best time to stop the company is when they first test the waters, not once they already know they‚Äôve gotten away with it.  Optimism doesn‚Äôt mean you just foolishly believe everything works out well in the end when many things point otherwise. That‚Äôs just foolishness.
---
Bethesda failed and Fallout 76 is a complete failure if game sales alone couldn't support the game for even its first year when popularity should be at its highest.
---
Bethesda really screwed up and lost out on a ton of revenue by releasing the game in such a poorly functioning state that it damaged sales.
---
In any case, the "it costs money" argument is tired. Of course it costs money, and the game wasn't free to buy. But with the current atom shop prices, if even a few thousand people purchase say a PA skin or weapon paint, it would cover a competent graphic artist's salary for a year for something they were able to create in 1 day, before lunch.
---
If they're not making money hand over fist, then they really screwed up budgeting and projecting their maintenance costs, hosting fees, etc, and that's why I say they failed.
---
People who paid for this get what they deserve. Have you not been paying attention for the last year?
---
I just want a 76 vats mod for fo4, after having real time vats I now find the slow motion irritating
---
time to start over! ;-)
---
Wow. You're dumb. Havent broken any laws is a low bar dude. Really low. Most shitty human being dont break laws every day. They are still scumbags.
---
I'll go there at night and see, to me it seems like they had removed a good portion of the plants, was more open. As you say probably time of day difference, thanks for checking though!
---
Coming from someone who probably no longer plays the game or hasn't at all. Roll along on your troll troll train.
---
&lt;150 active LFG posts right now. Usually double that any weeknight est until last week
---
They said private servers would come, here they are. I personally think they should only cost 10 but hey....
---
Maybe she got the keylogger. Remember few days back all the "my account has been hacked"
---
Turns out someone fucked over the people trying to cheat. Im not saying thats the case here... But not logging a report is super fishy.
---
Actually if you check digital sales, Fallout 76 was near the top every month this summer. Even if they've dropped down a bit this fall (I haven't checked in a couple months) they're doing very well overall.
---
Keep crying kids
---
I can hook you up with shit
---
Ya never know, some new spooky building.
---
I think ultimately they know no matter how much they screw up fallout 76, majority of the community will still consider buying Fallout 5 and Elder Scrolls VI when it comes out
---
Ok so I guess I imagined that inventory that clearly showed stuff üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
True and heck I haven't played since they fixed the infinite carry weight glitch ages ago. If I can pay $12 and get another months worth of enjoyment out of it and not have to worry about those limitations then I'll shell it out.
---
In that case I've seen multiple people lying about the same thing today which would mean there's either a bug in the game or an offensive attack of misinformation agents aimed at Fallout 76 to make people believe there's a bug. 
---
I know which one I find more likely ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. It's a bug in a new release, I don't know why people are acting like that's impossible. I'm sure they will get it all back but I don't think they're lying lol
---
more loot for me!
---
It‚Äôs a visual bug lol. People love to lie on here with no proof lol
---
Please send to bethesda then so it can be sorted
---
This literally happened to me mere minites ago. I‚Äôm logging a report as we speak
---
They weren't ignoring anything except the nonstop droning on and on from people who don't play the game complaining.
---
No one can see the future, of course in hindsight some dipshits are going "SEE WE TOLD YOU! WE TOLD YOU THIS COMPANY THAT HAS NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE WOULD DO THIS!!"
---
It doesn't matter anyway, this subreddit collectively complaining would absolutely do nothing to impact what is happening right now, the entire point of shit like this is to hook some whales, they don't care if the community is happy about it.
---
Nothing compared to "YOU KILLED MAMA MURPHY YOU MONSTER" or whatever the fuck that chick would say lmao.
---
They didn't, but they are the ones purchasing and supporting it
---
Just fyi, those effects aren't technically unreleased. Many of the 4* and 5* effects exist on at least one unique item in the game, and they were all datamined as existing since at least January. 
---
Really sucks though, although it's interesting to look at the abominations in your inv, imagining that they used to be prized god-tiers is just painful. This reminds me of the kind of stuff you saw in your corrupted hall of fame in pokemon red/blue after encountering missingno
---
Are you going to update this with Bethesda's response? Yes they did have a response to this and the stash issue.
---
Shit nvr dude I replied to wrong person. Fuck
---
&gt;However, we have since found that a small number of players have in fact experienced a loss of scrap items after placing them into the Scrapbox and then loading into a world. Resolving this issue is currently our top priority.
---
They added an edit to the article when Bethesda contacted them. So they are aware now.
---
I can only feel sorry for the gullible and disdain for the grifter.
---
That is all.
---
This ‚Üë‚Üë
---
Why the fuck would i want to play that? Id just play fallout4.
---
Well, you state look at minecraft... but minecraft, you *CAN* run your own servers. Sure, you can pay to have them hosted... but you don't have to. Which even your image quote acknowledges.
---
And no offense, but i could rent a quake 1 server back when that game was new... so, renting game servers is hardly a new phenomenon.
---
This is especially important for modders. as how am I meant to make huge game changing changes in my mods if I cannot access the server code that is controlling everything?
---
That we don't agree with. We think the mechanics should be in the base game and they should have stuck to the word. Though we all have our own opinions and views. The point is to respect the decisions of others without threats. I have been called fat, ugly, and told I should just go and fall down stairs (I am losing the use of my legs). He also said that my nephew should have been thrown to the wolves because he is autistic, so "normal" people have an easy life
---
You've posted the same crap on 4 other threads. I was giving you the benefit of the doubt, but everytime someone asks for proof you say something different. Be gone troll.
---
Slippery Slope is a fallacy only in so far as there's not evidence to support it.  The fallacy is the implication that the slope is slippery without evidence.
---
Yes I am making a report as we speak
---
Please tell me they lagged public to push private. At this point it's a game of limbo and I'm cheering for them to go as low as possible
---
Fuck Forbes for one thing.   Please post today's response from Bethesda they also talked about the instance issue.
---
Ah, thanks to Sony ps4‚Äôs mods are barebones. I mean I‚Äôve been able to do a lot more and customize my game a lot more in fallout 4 vr then I was with fallout on PS4. And fallout 4 vr technically doesn‚Äôt support mods period and PS4 fallout 4 technically supports mods. People just figured out how to make them work on the vr version (which is pc only).
---
You're all brain dead and are completely ruining the gaming industry as a whole. The amount of stupidness that has come from this game and you choose to play it and pay it. Sad, shame on you all. You all deserve a slap to the face just to realize how damaging your decisions are to the industry because you're reinforcing their bad behavior. It's like a dog biting you multiple times and now you also give him a dog treat so it encourages that bad behavior.
---
Years with the same thing, and you're still pre-ordering games? Yeah, that's why companies do this kind of shit.
---
You mean to pay for the empty servers they had since launch? After driving away the base with the game?  Everyone forgets while not stable this game had enough servers for launch players
---
Considering it is confirmed we arent getting actual servers but a privateish slice ide say 1$ a month. I dont want the atoms. I dont want the other crap.
---
The scrap box should be player wide.
---
I want the outfit but wont buy because fuck them, i would have actually bought that but now they blew it and it has ruined it for me
---
No it's invisible but still there. Fucking bug.  Bethesda responded saying they are trying to fix it.
---
this timeline is shit
---
How is BL3 a shitshow?  So far it‚Äôs the same as 1 and 2, which was the expectation.
---
Not true according to them late this afternoon. It's invisible in the stash but you should be able to still craft as normal.  They are working on a fix.
---
You can be a first class citizen without ever dumping money into this game, it's called grinding. You don't need private instances to get everything you could ever want or need. And what the fuck is all of this stuff about server stability? I've been playing 76 since Christmas day and the only problems I ever had  was my own Wi-Fi not working with my Xbox correctly which kicked me out of the game.  
---
If you're having issues storing junk maybe you should get rid of the stuff you don't need. Like that 10k glass scrap that takes up more than half of your stash, or the fucking unreasonable amount of oil you're never going to use.   
---
I have no fucking idea what kind of game you think you're playing when you believe you need to dump money to get the "full experience" when people have TSE lasers and BE railway rifles, or god forbid the fucking TESLAS that may have never even spent money on the atomic shop.   
---
If you want to see a game where you're playing as a second class citizen, play GTA Online where you usually can't get shit done unless you want to grind missions for hours OR BUY in-game money.
---
So nice to see some positivity and people actually understanding fo1st :)
---
On YouTube sry forgot to add
---
The issue is whether the camp budget was going to be added as base game free stuff, or whether it's part of the sub.
---
2 or 3
---
It's not really even about that. It is so anti consumer you might as well just change those atoms to fat piles of shit. 
---
Does this company deserve you money? Do ppl who bought the game at launch for full price under the guise of it being "all free after launch" not deserve your support over those who lied to you.
---
It's you money and life and you can do what you want and I honestly wont judge because we like what we like, and deserve to play the games you enjoy.
---
&gt; Not sure I agree, was able to replicate it using a total of 20 scrap, twice, and I don't have the scrap in my box... 
---
What steps did you take to replicate it???
---
Right here. If they launched this With wastelanders it would have been a hit. As is. Its an insult. Fire whoever made that call. Literally. Fire them right now and announce it.
---
I'm still playing
---
Ok cool thankyou
---
I feel that. Most people I've run in to dont take my workshop. some do. Then its brings the joy of pvp whether win or lose. Then maybe server hop or go to another workshop. collect resources for ammo or something. I love vending. Its my thing on fallout. Im always selling for way lower prices then other people. I find it crazy to be paying 12k for good 3 star. a couple thousand at most lol.
---
Not entirely.
---
You can run your own servers, but the paid server price isn‚Äôt to far off from what you pay for FO76.  
---
If you think it‚Äôs worth it or not is a personal debate - but we can‚Äôt say they lied when we have articles from before the game came out that said: they are going to control the servers and charge for them. 
---
And I don‚Äôt know - maybe the creation kit will come with a some type of limited test platform. We aren‚Äôt there yet.
---
The only thing even remotely fishy in there is the laser musket. Bethesda has made it blatantly clear through their inaction that they are perfectly okay with people buying things from dupers and dev room cheaters though. I believe the community reps even specifically said that they have no plans to remove anything like the marine combat helmets.
---
That's part of the reason why the game was a failed but cool concept to me
---
Love this take! Thank you for being positive! :D
---
Yeah, false advertisement. They arent private "servers" they are private worlds. It shouldnt even be legal to say what they are selling
---
Capcom would like to have a word with you. Ever since RE7, they've been knocking it out of the park with their games. In the past 2 years alone we got RE7, RE2 Remake, Monster Hunter World, DMC5, Mega Man 11.
---
Even the failed Marvel vs Capcom Infinite has amazing gameplay systems but was ruined by low budget and forced decisions on them by Disney regarding the roster of the game.
---
https://youtu.be/kjyeCdd-dl8
---
Links help my man.
---
Lame. Like the people who make weak ass YouTube videos.
---
Ive had no problem with patch 14, i fucking love this game!  Quite honestly i like it when people complain and cry so much.  Reminds me of the 2016 election.  Im still waiting for all the complainers to quit the game.
---
No hate here, mate, I have my fair share on this disaster the game industry is in too. The fps drops and hangs are awful here too, everything is strange, even to browse my own stash and vending machines I'm experiencing as much as 5 seconds for them to load, it's like I'm always ready to see the "Server Not Responding" prompt on the right side of the screen...
---
There are no free atoms. Its part of the sale.
---
This is literally a saga of shenanigans and I love the depth of it
---
Yeah and I paid so I won, just quit. We won‚Äôt miss you.
---
I didn't ask for it, but I like it
---
Was my first thought when i saw it, yet i havent seen anything on this till now. What a scummy game
---
Plus you can buy full game for no more than $23. Less than 2 month subscription. 1650 Atmos is shy of the 1800 you need for power armor skins. It's sick and wrong on so many levels.
---
I was gifted the laser musket by a friend. Captainnoob made a review of it so I would assume it would be safe to own
---
Um, bullshit. Plenty of us who have been playing the game complained. The fact you think it is all people who didn‚Äôt just says you are one of the ones who frustrated me who downplayed our concerns.  Up until two days ago I‚Äôve been playing fallout 76. It‚Äôs been my main game I played for more than half this year (until rockstar finally made red dead online interesting). 
---
You realize some of the most bitter people about something a company does is those that love the product and really don‚Äôt want to see it ruined?  You know that saying, ‚Äúhell has no fury like a lover scorned?‚Äù  Same kinda idea applies. Hell has no fury like a fan whose obsession you are ruining.
---
Dude, you're so original and funny. Will you be my dad? Like you are so cool, wow.
---
I feel this. I say "Hey I enjoy this game" and get told 6x that I'm a "idiot shill" like damn.... 76 is my favorite game. I think people are overreacting big time. I don't see anything wrong with fo1st and everything in the atom shop is free  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
I always thought of it as just a never ending F4, which I was good with. Welp it just ended lol
---
Thanks
---
I like doing stuff like this and finding them as well
---
Yup I rly don't get how people are ok for paying monthly for quality of life changes that we were told would be free...you are essentially paying a monthly payment for hotfixes.
---
How am I suppose to prove something on someone else's account? I'm not a troll or need to be a troll. Be gone with the dumb shit troll. I havent said a single thing different.
---
People are arguing hardcore that it is not an advantage. Need proof. Check my post history.
---
All you can do is not respond to those comments. Im seeing 4 of the same people here that I see in many posts talking shit to people who post about bugs/issues. But whatever on that, it's nothing new
---
Good luck with customer service
---
Cool story bro, changed my life!
---
I'm surprised you guys are even playing this shit game
---
"Free" or "not free," my point remains the same. Put the ranger armor in the Atom Shop, the scrap box in the base game, and the tent behind a quest (put tent skins in the Atom Shop), and I'll have some interest in the subscription. Give us genuinely private servers, and I'll have some interest in paying full price for the subscription.
---
The horrible thing is I keep finding plenty of people that haven't seen the error and bought this up right away. Al least see the game is sold for $23 on their site right now. Give it couple months, year sub might be 25
---
Oh wow. Did this mess you up for good? Are you still able to put new scrap in it?
---
Then do you agree that Bethesda has made mistakes again and again? I'm not saying all they made are mistakes, but huge mistakes again and again. 
---
If so, then what do you think we should do as consumers? 
---
Give them more goodwill and believe they fix their mistakes even though they repeat them again and again? Or should be do something else?
---
Oi don't crap on his videos m8 just keep the bad to yourself I mean even shroud watched it
---
I didn't at all say that **all** complaints were from people who don't play.
---
No problem, I'm not blind like most people on this sub. Remember "the first step towards change is awareness. The second step is acceptance."
---
lol my gaming group has been saying similar, saw some people on facebook with the same mentality. Like, BYEEE! The people bitching are the same toxic players that troll, spam and dupe landmines til they crash a server. No one is gonna miss you! but I'd be happy to take those "meta" armors and weapons you hoard off your hands!
---
Truth is though, they're not leaving and if they do, they'll be back for wastelanders lol
---
'I gave you my helping hand and you grabbed me by the foot'
---
And also, doesn‚Äôt matter that Bethesda hasn‚Äôt done it yet. Most other major game companies have and have been successful at making a fuckton of money. Do you really think corporations don‚Äôt notice what other corporations do that work?  You don‚Äôt run a successful corporation by ignoring obvious tactics that make money. The whole reason for 76 was they were trying to jump on that games as a service money train. I called it when they put out fallout shelter. They were testing the waters on how successful they could be with microtransactions. 76 was a natural next step. I was hoping they‚Äôd stay true to the cosmetic only promise and be able to make the money they want that way but for me the repair kits were an obvious sign that was not going to be.
---
My thoughts on this are that you‚Äôre partially correct. We did have all this in prior games and this is actively getting more expensive. However, if the quality of this game was on par with FO4 I would somewhat understand. It took many years for them to build FO4 and the result of that effort was a rich storyline, NPCs, content rich DLCs that cost around the same now as a fridge in FO76 and your actions in that game actually mattered. 
---
This doesn‚Äôt operate like FO4, going back to what many others said in the first couple months after release, it feels cold and empty. The storyline can be likened to reading an interactive book, because that‚Äôs what a lot of this game is - reading a lonely computer screen. The quality has gotten worse and the cost has skyrocketed for a lesser immersive experience. $120 for a BETTER game? I‚Äôve dropped that on Cities Skylines and don‚Äôt regret it.
---
I remember when I was first introduced to Fallout, I didn't like it but that was because I didn't know anything about the lore and when I did read about it, it was awesome and when I started playing Fallout New Vegas it was awesome. Then I installed mods and got 10x better and I was fucking around killing a lot of people. When they announced Fallout 76, I was excited to hunt down players and RP by making a faction and I like the enclave for the purpose to literally murder everybody but you know, I was broke at the time but I am so glad I didn't buy Fallout 76. Now, we are here with all this bullshit Bethesda is doing and questioning what the fuck are they doing?
---
People have known that there would be a paid service of some sort since 2018, Wastelanders probably got moved to next year to avoid the same kind of mess of a launch that the base game was.
---
Nice
---
You just described why the player base for this game is awful and the issues for enabling horrible business practices. 
---
You're the kind of blind faith fan that leads to shittier games and more monetization.
---
This game was cheap, only 60 bucks for the base game.  Only 13 a month for some badass shit.  If you cant afford it dont pay, its chump change homey.  Go back to minecraft
---
I guess the news outlets, gaming journalists, and youtubers covering this and outright telling people to not buy it are also just a bunch of neckbeards? Even if every dev in the team is a cynical asshat who doesn't give an iota of a shit about how well received their product is, getting this bad of a reception is putting their job security at risk. If this game dies by 2020, they will be reassigned to a different project or just fired if there are no openings.
---
A cosmetic shop *in lieu of proper content, against customer backlash, while not fixing bugs* however is a different matter. A lot of people who claim "slippery slope fallacy" ignore that there's a lot more than a single point on the line *already* when the argument is being put forward.
---
Heh, my gaming group splits the costs of private games/servers. I'll let them know at least one person appreciates it lol
---
I love floating around in the Dead Sea while all of the salty posts keep poping up by people who cant afford the sub or just dont/havent played the game keep me afloat. I'll keep sitting here reading your posts drinking my tea and enjoying my subscription. 
---
‚úå
---
Reminds me when that SimCity reboot came out, and people were pissed and confused as to why it was always online. EA claimed the simulations in the game were so advanced that they needed to be done on EA's servers. 
---
A few days later some dude modded the game to play offline, no issues. Not too long after, they added Offline Mode in an update. 
---
It's honestly embarrassing.
---
spooky roads take me home!
---
If I don't pay as much as you I am playing an inferior version of the game. You win over me by paying. I don't need to explain the details, but most all subs make those not paying have disadvantages
---
Ticket Submitted
---
I love itand the decorations. Its a shame I cant usethe halloween vendor without messing with my theme too much
---
and Corporate Commander 
---
(Angry Joe has been having some nice rants about the subject of late too lol)
---
I was with you all the way until you condemned people to using and living in their Toyota Celica. What kind of monster are you?!
---
Instead of reacting like the idiot who claimed the domain name of fallout first, we respectfully but firmly raise our voices and protest. All that guy did was lash out childishly and in my view, make a fool out of himself. Nothing was achieved there. I've been regularly sending Bethesda support tickets and suggestions on things I'd like to see changed, and other things implemented or removed.
---
If enough people did that instead of whine and moan on the sub like they do now, maybe we might see actual change. We're (somewhat) adults, or at least mature enough to be civil, I don't see why we can't act that way.
---
So, as a Ps4 user, don't go back to the Ps4 main interface while leaving or loading into a world? (I assume that is dashboarding?)
---
the videos i saw they couldnt craft either that doesnt sound like a visual bug
---
Death Stranding comes out in two weeks.
---
too late :-p
---
Also, this will affect what little game economy there was. Why won't all ammo and scrap be 1 cap when some guy can hold 100000 lead, etc.
---
I took out all my scrap before i did this, the wood piece was a test piece, and yes i can still put stuff in it. I also tested by putting another piece of wood, dashboarding and rejoining the server. The piece of wood was still there.
---
Apparently Beth announced that this is a visual error only...if so shouldn‚Äôt it be easily fixed by scrapping the scrap loot box?  I hope not b/c if it‚Äôs visual only folks should be able to get thier stuff back ü§ûüèª
---
Oh I thought people meant there was no bug at all and everyone was just 100% lying lmao
---
Yes! I've only had time to play for a few hours in my group's private session. But it was so nice to take workshops and play around with building in them that I had never taken before! And for the past like 2 weeks, I could not play a single game without running into someone duping landmines by the thousands and lagging out a massive area in the map until the server crashed. Not worrying about that is worth every penny.
---
The outer worlds is pretty great though
---
Na some people are saying there stuff is gone when it‚Äôs not gone. You just can‚Äôt see it if you have the glitch
---
I agree that they should sell more items separately from the bundle. They can still have the bundles.
---
Im not salty. Im cackling with glee at people getting burnt over and over and over and over again. It's like a marvel of science at this point.
---
That's a whole lotta shit easier spoken in hindsight. The gap between some crummy utility items in the atom store and a full on P2W subscription service a month later is massive.
---
You didn't call anything, you assumed the worse every step and it happened to work out. It wasn't some sneaky inching closer and closer, they genuinely went from 0 to 80 the past week with delaying Wastelanders and introducing this garbage pay model, and no one was predicting that shit.
---
Ha
---
Already deleted from my PS4 harddrive.
---
does Mothman scare you?
---
Epic store exclusive and all the crap with Randy Pitchford. 
---
Otherwise shockingly I have heard nothing about the game since it launched. Of course Epic store has no user reviews so who knows what the game is even like.
---
Yeah but if we let this slide all games will be $120+ if they're good instead of companies just releasing good games like they should be to begin with
---
It's...it's just so...**beautiful**.
---
That dude is a sad broken little person.
---
gone but not forgotten
---
lets make a memorial video to all the scrap we lost
---
Same, played tons. I have 4k atoms and lots of store items and never paid a cent. I just do challenges and only buy stuff when it's on sale etc.
---
Its stored on the Bethesda server...that your character account is linked to...this isn't rocket science.
---
Hey Solstice! Also just happened to a guy who only moved his camp, it emptied his scrapbox
---
RIP Scrap.....till we meet again....
---
I just wanted to play a version of Fallout 4 or Skyrim, side-by-side with my partner and no-one else.  
---
Why was that so hard for them?  Why did that have to mean... *this shit?*
---
Good idea. I don't have any other paints, but maybe I can get another player to try.
---
Man, that person is making gaming history.
---
There was a rumour spiraling around when 76 first came out that there was some company sabotage going on. I don't know if there's any truth really to it. But I do know that a bunch of the toxicity and negativity is born on youtube and 99% of youtubers opinions are purchased.
---
I lost all mine and can't even craft it's saying I have mothing
---
In the words of Driver Nephi, get fucked.
---
What if there is nothing to show?  Like what if the reason it is delayed is really because they haven't worked on it almost at all, and have been busy getting this sub thing to work?
---
this is a 7000 series train
---
Makes sense. I assume it's visual and if not for some I'm sure they'll get all items back. I for one am loving the shenanigans of outrage and the chapter of this whole thing. The game may not have a story but it sure wrote a real life saga
---
As this issue happened to someone on PC, I assume there are equivalents on each platform, which would be what you consider to be a "force quit". Test with a single piece of junk and let us know if you can
---
Just horde mentality . One person gets mad then the next then the next. If you enjoy the game like many of us do then just keep having fun
---
Another Bethesda shill crying, Whales are the reason why games are the dumpster fires they are today.
---
I didn't realise that. I thought that when they were missing it was because they had been taken already. The guide book says they should be there.
---
Ooh i reached charlestonüòÇüòÇ
---
Yea, If they add a lot more to the sub maybe i'd buy it if it cost less but I probably wont because i dont need another tent or scrapbox or private server. so at that point im paying for the atoms. which i usually get enough of.
---
You sure you get less lag? I wouldn't be. Wait till you get disconnected and be pissed because you are paying 10 a month for garbage connection
---
The fact Sekiro was backed by Activision and they still created an amazing game without selling their soul to share-holders speaks volumes of their character.
---
May they stay a bright bonfire in this dark corporate abyss.
---
Imagine launching a AAA title broken then releasing a paid subscription broken. Wake up lmao
---
Me too! Per ex-wife; however, she pronounces differently when speaking to me
---
Private servers were one if the most requested features by users. Everyone thinks they should be free and not cost anything to own a private server.
---
I have the same one but with furious...i love it
---
Mine is at least an informed opinion. Yours is based on something a year ago &amp; now your just joining in to spread hate on a game that you have no idea about. Please post in the forums for games you actually play &amp; not here.
---
Life must be sad for you, so much hate that you have to share it.
---
Yes. This is also fine word.
---
I remember those hopeful, pie-in-the-sky threads.  People posting about starting up their own wasteland radio stations, setting up persistent shops, roleplaying as highwaymen and vigilantes for justice, setting up saloons as chill places for people to put their feet up and have a brew.
---
'When every player is a character,' they said, 'you don't need NPCs.'
---
Yeah.  Look at what they got.  Look at what those dreams and ideals were worth.
---
You can disguise your üßÇall ya want. It's still üßÇ.

Expensive? Even if you pay monthly, it‚Äôs the equivalent of a McDonalds for 2.
---
I don‚Äôt know man, I think that candle is held by new Vegas, IMO 4 was a HUGE disappointment, it had great elements to it, and a pretty decent map, but so much of it felt muddy, uninspired and lazy, they tried to emulate something that was popular, and just none of it carried over very well, and I hate that I say that because I gave it 100 hours worth of trying and I still don‚Äôt love it as much as I want to mainly because of the ‚Äúrpg‚Äù aspect which I‚Äôm hesitant to even call it that was reeaaallll disappointing considering what we had in prior games.
---
Thanks man, it will make it better for us all :)
---
Hi, day 1 purchase sucker here. Also they refused me a refund which I guess is illegal considering the state of the game, but they were probably told to lie to stop refunds. Anyway, I gave the game a go, I think I hit lv 100, killed the queen a bunch. Then they started nerfing useful and effective things in their first balance patch.
---
I uninstalled the game that day and now only watch in with morbid curiosity.
---
Im sorry that it had to come to this for many of you to see what I saw back then, but there is some important decision makers at Bethesda who do not give a shit about us or what we care about, and just wanted to leverage us to get some of that sweet mobile/live service high-return-on-investment money. 
---
I still feel like they owe us an apology but they never even fucking took full responsibility and ownership of the bullshit they willingly and knowingly subjected us to.
---
Just remember, from this point on:  
---
No  
---
Preorders
---
yes as punishment he must be forced to play Fallout 76 and no other game
---
FOR LIFE!!!!!!!!!!
---
7 all day
---
By then there should be 10 other actual full good games
---
Remember the Ninja/Rick and Morty/and some rapper fail not live live stream?
---
That was a sneak peak of the quality to be expected
---
How much do you eat at McDonald's? 2 large Big Mac combos are like $12 so you're getting that plus a dollar ice cream? Damn dude
---
On behalf of every person on the internet who is currently laughing at you and your community, thanks for ruining the industry. How does that big bent bethesda dick taste? Rotten eggs? Perhaps it tastes like failure, but I guess you lot are very familiar with that word.
---
It's a cliff. And there are angry snarlygasters and mirelurk kings at the bottom.

I hope so, keep all you peasants out
---
Pete lines
---
Will do. Give me like 5 mins. Just got to my camp.
---
It was taxing my sanity to keep logging in and finding nothing on the map that was worth doing. Nobody running events...very few people on the map...delayed DLC...overpriced atoms and private servers. 
---
It was too much.
---
Saving up 1k script for the half off sale to blow through it in five minutes and get total junk killed it for me
---
Fallout is dead. Let it go.
---
Sorry but what is 'cooldown'?
---
I've never been burned on a pre-order until now. Bethesda games had always been good.
---
Nobody can help you here other than to point you to file a claim ticket.  They can and do refund atoms.
---
Same! Literally everything from the moment 76 was announced it was EXACTLY what I wanted.
---
My boyfriend and I are gamers together. We usually only play multiplayer together. We LOVED fallout 4 and would play it side by side on the couch, with our two tvs next to each other. But we wanted multiplayer SO BAD. And literally like 2 months before 76 was announced I remember my boyfriend saying "They'll never make a game that takes place in my home state"
---
Then BOOM 76 is EVERYTHING we wanted! And we are HAPPY to give them more money for giving us everything we wanted. As two people with a lifetime of playing video games, 76 instantly became our new favorite. The private sessions are MORE than what we expected and love the bonuses it provides! (and even though he's the one with Fo1st, I don't feel like I'm being left out from the few little extras he has.)
---
I love it, I will scream from the rooftops that I love it.
---
This is so misleading. Most people are upset because they locked quality of life improvements behind a paywall alongside private servers. Quality of life improvements that they claimed were impossible until they figured out how to monetize them which is classic corporate bait and switch anti consumer tactics.
---
Well, you can even force a Bethesda employer to do the most "terrifying" thing to them, working on the game for at least 10 minutes a month.
---
That would be nice!
---
so how ya liking it?
---
Game is still awesome and play when i can.  I pay 13 a month, no problems
---
"Devs and companies dont recieve any money once the original purchased has processed".
---
Duh, that's the idea. You only have to pay once.
---
You're an idiot.
---
You‚Äôre the problem if you bought first. Cancel that shit
---
Buyed
---
Honestly, they legitimately are one of the few hopes I have for modern triple A gaming. Hopefully Elden Ring continues to hit those highs (you know, when it actually comes out, which at this rate nobody knows when).

They had this planned long ago. If it was a good product they would have rode the wave a bit longer before moving to this phase. They had a successful model from Elder Scrolls Online and step by step tried to replicate it. 
---
Except the first step, make a fucking decent game. ESO is, it's close to a light version of an Elder Scrolls Game with what you would expect from an MMO. Though it's cash shop has shit like 100$ houses, and loot crates obscuring 200$ mounts, but you can actually get a lot from the game itself by just playing for free. Every single quest story quest is voice acted, there are even some charming characters.
---
Bethesda just went got fucking lazy, asset flipped Fallout 4, made a big map and then launched unfinished, a mess, and with no real content.
---
They then proceeded to keep going with the plan, completely ignoring how insulting it was considering the fundamental disaster the exercise was.
---
Just like game breaking bugs that are later to be proven non-existent. Reported by the fallout 76 I never have actually played the game(or I was banned because I'm a duper) hate team
---
Now, seeing how they would try to monetize single player games like those, interests me. 
---
Really would make or break Beth.
---
What did he say?
---
&gt; maybe this whole Wastlanders DLC is not going to be as big as peoples expect.
---
I absolutely guarantee this is it right here, and I was betting this was the case even when people were hyping it up a few months ago.
---
It‚Äôs totally gonna be like... maybe one ‚Äòsettlement‚Äô with 2 or 3 named NPC‚Äôs at most. They‚Äôll MAYBE have set routines, but I‚Äôm willing to put money down that most of them will stand still, or have a set path they walk over and over again, while saying ‚Äúhey‚Äù when you walk up and try and interact with them. 
---
The probably can‚Äôt show off much, even if it is mostly finished, becuase even showing one conversation would be showing a huge chunk of the update. 
---
That and let‚Äôs not forget how many quests in the main quest line are still totally broken. Now they have to add a whole new story, and expect THIS to work properly? Yeah. Okay.
---
Yeah but so was Hitler!  Ahaha, too far?
---
Private worlds were always going to be paid. You'd have to be naive to think otherwise.   
---
And modding can't come to public worlds or all hell is going to break loose.
---
Yeah every person in that armor is the problem.
---
That is a strawman. Junk items take less server capacity to track. Not mention people have been utilizing mule characters to achieve unlimited storage from day one.
---
 I don't care to comment specifically about what the fallout first guy did.
---
But sending support tickets to Bethesda isn't enough. This is evident by whatever Bethesda has been doing. You should keep sending them though, they provide ideas for Bethesda. But whether they take it into account is another issue. And how they implement those solutions the community provide is another issue as well. 
---
Fact is Bethesda is screwing up big time. And complaining publicly, whether childish or not, is a way to spread awareness to Bethesda that it has screwed up big time. 
---
What I gather is you agree that Bethesda has made a ton of huge mistakes, but you just agree on a different approach to solving this issue? 
---
The best way to solve this issue is to signal to Bethesda by disincentivizing them to carry out decisions that consumers do not want. And how do we do that? By boycotting and associating their bad decisions to their name, which leads to a lowered reputation for Bethesda, which leads to lower sales and thus profits. 
---
This is the only way to signal to a profit driven firm(by definition) to balance consumer relations and profits. Because either end of the spectrum won't maximize their profits. And they need to be reminded when they are near either end of the spectrum. 
---
So in conclusion, it is naive to think that just by sending Bethesda messages through official channels would solve the problem. It would help but it is not enough. Awareness of their mistakes needs to be spread far and wide. And your defense for them isn't justified towards this end.
---
Yup
---
It's a fucking scam, they're preying on the delusional fanboys on this sub who'd buy Todd Howard's shit in a paper bag for 200 bucks and defend their purchase afterwards.
---
Positive reinforcement of negative behavior rarely yields good results.
---
Wish I could upvote you again. Like you said, it's been nearly a year. I'm still waiting for the game to be stable enough to merit even considering buying my first atoms. I can't in good conscience give them a dime when they still owe me a game worth its purchase price.
---
Bethesda Maryland, the people making Starfield and ES6 aren't the ones making 76.
---
Im with you man but from my testing it happens if you hard quit the game. I wouldnt put anything in there you care about yet, all it takes is one infinite load or blue screen. Also dont move your camp with  the box built! Cheers brothaüçª
---
you sick bastard...
---
I didnt know spinoff means total garbage POS with arbitrarily limited gameplay elements just to be sold later.
---
I always feel like most people just assume if you play the game you are onboard with every aspect of it, i like 76 and continues to play it because I can play it a way I want, without actually ever spending money, nothing has been taken away from me for not spending money and other people buying things never effects me. I will say the pass and how inefficient and non functional it is, is really REALLY bad, but since me having fun doesn‚Äôt require it and its existence doesn‚Äôt effect me playing 76 I‚Äôm not going to stop playing a game I already payed for.
---
Debit card
---
I agree completely. Tonight I‚Äôve been remembering the days of new, full game releases for the PS1 @ $20 back in the 90s, which is kind of funny considering the way things work today. I would never want to see games that cost that much but I think with AR/VR it might become an unfortunate reality in the coming decades. I suppose we can only hope that the quality will rival where we are now.
---
I don't even care to know why, but thanks for supporting a lying company and I hope they don't screw you in this subscription

I think he's a bloody idiot or he  lives in Chad (life expectancy is 50).
---
I'm nearly 40 and can run rings around most young guys at work.
---
I played the game, I dropped that shit at the first balance patch when I got to see where their priorities were. This was pretty easy to call.
---
Any hope for being wrong and for them to turn it around died a little bit more with each new piece of news.
---
The frat house has some stuff in it along with the different types of nuka cola. Well last I checked
---
Opening a crafting bench breaks my game
---
Rest in pieces
---
Here is what I just did...
---
Held the ps button on controller, closed application (fo76), re started fo76 and loaded into a private server, my 5 glass shards, 2 steel, and 1 wood are still in my scrap box.
---
I actually had the game freeze earlier when I had most of my scrap in a scrap box (mine, if that matters. As in my private server) and when I tried to rejoin a ps friend list friend (who was on my private server), it took me to an adventure world, and all my scrap was still in my scrap box.
---
I've read too that it seems to be people joining people's private servers and they them use that persons box and lose their junk.  But, that could just be random/odd occurance.
---
Dude ur not fucking funny I worked a long time to get atoms to spend on some bs not even half ass bs it was the fucking skin for the alone blaster!
---
THIS! Exactly this. If trolls hadn't of jumped on the 76 hate train and trashed it to the ground. They wouldn't have had to make new ways to continue funding what was stated to be a side project.
---
If a certain area of a company isn't making the company money, they cut off that area. The devs are trying to keep it from being amputated.
---
I have some cool weapons and enjoy almost killing myself when I use my tse laser rifle.
---
If it helps, Bethesda didn't come up with the Fallout world.  Fallout is basically an Interplay/Black Isle creation.  So Bioware legitimately has more claim to the world than Bethesda, which bought the rights for Fallout 3.  Bethesda has only done what, 3 Fallout games--two of which were the worst in the series?  Interplay/Black Isle did 2 and Obsidian did 1.
---
But there are definitely better ways of protest that doesn't make us all look like children and doesn't make them look inept. There's always a middle ground.
---
Well to be fair, with games like fortnite that has updates every week, its a loophole so an update doesn‚Äôt have to go through review with Microsoft or Sony since the game is technically still in its beta stages
---
Yeah...Well...Only a sick mind can think at something this horrible...
---
According to Webster's dictionary this was not a bait and switch https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bait%20and%20switch
---
what issues?
---
That's what I don't get. Who even needs unlimited scrap at this point? To kill another 20 scorch beasts to get stuff you don't use? I can still have fun with it but more scrap is the last thing I need
---
People who played fallout on release are nowhere near dying, 40 isn't that fucking old..
---
did you read my post kind sir? i didnt buy the membership. i bought the game. i just love the game. i think its okay to like fallout 76. üòÅ Its been one year since Reclamation day üéÜand im doing just fine üëçüíΩCOUNTRY ROADS....‚õ∫
---
I haven't played in a while and I feel like I'm missing some information here. Did Bethesda do a big goof?
---
 SO?  It is still not P2W, it is QOL.  There is a simple solution for you if you disagree don't buy it.  Either enough people will or won't support the game.
---
Its completely negates the entire year  of my inventory management and overlooking and ignoring many materials and all the rare items i vended or broke down. With the premium i can now spend one weekend looting every building in the game and never have to farm again. I went to white springs today picked up every single item not nailed down and dropped a tent on the green and saved myself a few extra days of work. Prior to this would have left the majority of things on the ground  to save time and inventory. I even stored a bunch of extra items to sell at my store later as 70-80% of my inventory is now freed up. It felt great and was entirely game changing and completely advantageous. Takes away a great chunk of tediousness to the game. Something that should have been implemented since day one for all of us. Its oxymoronic that i paid for it. I hope this backlash gives everyone the bin. If the sub just gave me exclusive premium skins,access to the 9.99 bundle outfits and some free atomic shop items  monthly id call it even. This bin should save the game not break it in half again.

Somewhere on the betha website you can open a ticket and select the right choices for atom shop dispute and they will not only give you your atoms back but let you keep the item
---
Anthem bricked some people's ps4s, so it is possible.
---
Whoops!
---
I keep picking up this game every few weeks in hoping it will be better and I just keep getting punched in the face with disappointment.
---
Something changed and some people didn‚Äôt like that change and are upset about it.
---
You got key logged. Sorry you thought you were above the rest of the player base.
---
EDIT: i hope you didn't check your bank/pay your bills/ get on grinder... Cause your about to be fucked if so.
---
I keep playing because I‚Äôve played and enjoyed grindy games my entire life (runescape, diablo, wow, etc) but that being said about those games I have noticed that there is significant and persistent testing from the devs AND the player base. If we could have PTR‚Äôs from Bethesda like we do with Runescape, Diablo, etc then I think we would have a MUCH better time with our current issues. There‚Äôs a catch though with this; companies need a consistent player base, and a consistent flow of resources in order to do this. Bethesda did go about this partially wrong in terms of what was offered compared to what has been paid. IE: a service that has caused issues that could have been prevented through player and dev testing. All in all I respect where Bethesda is coming from because you can‚Äôt run a game on trivial cosmetic MTX forever, so the funding has to come from somewhere. And I‚Äôd HOPE that there would be some sort of further motivation to provide a better experience to a community that is consistently paying for a service from them, than what has been provided thus far.
---
Doubt it this is the gaming industry very little oversight one of the few places u can get away with lying to your customers and selling broken products
---
Keep trying to convince yourself it's worth it.
---
My theme is Mothman, camp is at Marigold so it‚Äôs perfect for me lol
---
Game development is not as simple as you might think. That was a year+ ago. A lot has happened and they had to make changes.
---
Shit happens. Things change. Get over it.
---
These are the steps we did:
---
1. Add items to scrap box
---
2. leave world (we were in private server, OP is the person in the video and owner of the server, using his own box)
---
3. Press Play on the main FO76 screen. Select public or private server. 
---
4. After "world found! .." but before you actually enter the world, close the application 
---
5. Launch game again, load into a server and check the scrap box.
---
Read the last patch notes, they just fixed floating and sliding mobs plus the goo that would disappear..ONE year after release
---
ThisüëÜ.....none of the controversies have bothered me.  Im on PC and except for a couple disconnects i haven't had many problems with the game.  People just need something to bitch about.  The game is actually quite amazing in my opinion.
---
I hear the scrap box deletes stuff so... same thing?
---
It was a aLine  blaster skin why I'm do w first pay walls now this I spend thousands of hours on this game for this
---
Why wouldn't it?
---
Not.. anymore!
---
Gotcha, I'll try that.
---
But the game isn't really a PVP based game? And people don't PVP with junk items. They PvP with legendaries, and that hasn't changed at all, other than maybe you could argue that people actually get to farm their own nuke drops now, instead of dropping a nuke, only to have another group constantly run in front of you and try to kill things so you don't get any drops.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Thank you for your response! I've been so confused, do private servers actually change anything for people like myself?  I can't wait for this month to be over! It's my busiest time at work so I don't have time to play! So I've really been looking forward to blowing off some steam.
---
Fallout 1st costs the equivalent of ¬£8.25 p/m. 
---
2 Big Mac meals costs ¬£8.58.
---
How was he keylogged, the keylogger stole shit not corrupt shit.
---
1k script at 50% off got me f-all and that killed it for me. Huge waste if time
---
Thats very much an oversimplification. The store now in total has added up and all these individual conveniences  are really beginning to compound. 
---
I have seen tons of valid talking points about how this game has become p2w. Is it just barely hitting the line, sure, its small. Its also still just starting. The first dlc isn't even out yet.
---
So believe what you want and ignore what i say. You are wrong, and if the argument seems valid that your not now, its pretty clear you will be soon.
---
Not visual for me brotha, I was messaged first by a dev about it being visual in the morning &amp; have already confirmed my vault steel &amp; flux is gone. I lack components to craft simply
---
Cool story. They still should not be locking quality of life improvements behind a paywall, especially when they said those changes were impossible due to server limitations and also promised we would never be charged for quality of life changes.
---
Drugs...lots of drugs.
---
Is that a fail or an epic fail?
---
It's so much fun you had to stop playing and come here to justify it to yourself?
---
Enjoy your game.
---
To quote Bethesda:
---
&gt;"You deserve it."
---
If it bothers you, dont play
---
I was not keylogged lmao. This is an issue affecting other people as well. I don't download third party programs for this game, and even if I did I know which ones are keyloggers and which aren't. This is purely an issue coming from Bethesda and 76.
---
That will teach Bethesda to try to sell games for money.
---
Now hopefully we can convince all those whales and sheep defending and throwing money at them the same thing. You guys gotta realize we're "hating" on the game because we love it and we don't want to see it go this path. Don't you think we're tired of seeing articles and youtubers constantly shitting on a game that we once enjoyed heavily? Think about that before you blindly support this game and let it divide all of us.
---
Maybe a little too far, but I'll take it knowing I'm not one of the idiots buying a subscription!
---
You'll need the perks Startched Genes and, I think, Class Freak to retain them. Disease cure and antibiotics won't get rid of them but Rad Away will.
---
EDIT: Rad Away will get rid of the mutation IF you don't have Startched Genes applied.
---
EDIT 2: Class Freak reduces the negative effects of the mutation.
---
You asked for help. I helped the way I could. Apologies. Next time, take your time, type carefully, and ask nicely as its random users on here. That being said, this is a reddit, not a help desk. Literally none of us normal users here can help you. You should file a support ticket with Bethesda and/or call them during business hours. Hopefully someone can get you your atoms back or find some satisfactory solution. Next time be very careful. Accidental purchases are too easy in many games unfortunately. :/ Good luck. Hope you get your atoms back.
---
If someone disliked it so much, continued to do so, *and* bought fallout 1st, then that doesn‚Äôt really make sense. I don‚Äôt think most people who got the sub were torturing themselves with a game they hated the last 11 months.
---
The impossibility due to server limitations was noted towards the fact that junk is on a different type of integer compared to 1000 of different handmades with different values. But I understand where you‚Äôre coming from.
---
Sounds like your still putting time and money into a known broken game
---
Yeah that's what it was telling my friend when he tried to make a weapon for my low level, it said he lacked the components and it showed him having no wood or steel.
---
The infinite junk stash was an idea taken straight from ESO, another game from the same conglomerate. Different skin and names but same exact concept. Which means they intended to charge a subscription the entire time. They never once said that they would never offer a subscription. The only promised that new DLCs wouldn't cost money. I know that you badly want them to be these horrible, terrible people to justify your outrage, but that's just not the case. People expect to much and give too little in return.
---
Yes, they mentioned private servers before. We have them now. They were always going to have a fee associated with them. Why anyone thought otherwise is beyond me. Nothing in life is free.
---
Well if you still like playing this fucking game which I have uninstalled to show my disappointment in the sub paywall service your talking about. Then after you get your atoms back spend them on what you actually want then request a refund again. Keep doing it twice a month every month till they realize they are fucked in the ass.
---
Remember when they opened a cash shop and said "cosmetics only"? Yeeeeeah... that's how it always starts. Guess the lesson here is when that happens in a game - DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT.
---
The worst thing is: it wouldn't even feel good to say "we told you so".  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
It was a 3rd party.. A hero in the dark. They have fucked over cheaters. Your laser musket there says you're not on the up and up. Id wipe your pc... Keyloggers are no joke.
---
EXACTLY!
---
Do you have 8 mules and 2 mains? 6400 lbs of stash space and 15000 lbs of character space..? Didn't think so...you are talking to a 76 multi-millionaire...hoarding on an absurd level. The fools who bought a year of Fallout 1st could have gotten used PS4s and 76 practically free and do exactly what I do as far as hoarding and being rich as fuck....but they are morons.
---
Sorry I was mad when I wrote that I do appreciate ur calm response I will take ur advice to heart
---
I just want content, game is so stale and has been honestly the whole time.
---
Don't pay for broken games. Problem solved
---
A gut turning fail
---
Just logged in for the evening on Xbox and all scrap is gone.  I wasn't playing with anyone else last night, but I did start out on a private server and then later in the evening played on a public one.  During those sessions everything was fine.
---
Unlike the Forbes article response where Bethesda says its visual only, my items do not appear to be available for crafting.  Submitted a ticket already as well.  I'm going to go fiddle a bit and see, but quite discouraged right now.
---
Okie Dokie, bye
---
If you are referring to the fallout first guy's actions and maybe others? I'm not sure who else you are referring to. I don't find the falloutfirst guy's website to be particularly funny and am neutral about it since it's just satire. The line is crossed when it becomes personal or evil in intent(like killing and other evil acts), when it comes to spreading awareness of Bethesda's mistakes. 
---
If it's just the falloutfirst guy, then I agree that such responses are not needed. But I still do not agree with you trying to defend Bethesda.
---
Have y'all learned your lessons about pre-ordering or are you gonna keep letting companies make crappier games for the rest of us? =P
---
They didn't have to look to Activision or EA. They saw how much money ESO raked in by full on banking on their mtx cash store, and thought they could duplicate that with games like Blades and FO76. I see a lot of respect for ESO these days, but they have been pushing the boundaries how far they can go with their cash store every bloody update since the game went B2P. So if FO76 survives, you should fully expect lootboxes next. Still, it worked out for ESO because the transition to B2P made it more accessible, not less, and there was actual content and a solid game below it to back it up. Can we say that about FO76 and Blades?
---
Strangely enough, their other F2P TES game, Legends, is really really fair with its monetization. Fallout shelter isn't that terrible either. I don't know why there's such a disconnect there.
---
Longtime Fallout player. I‚Äôm going to write this in a neutral way and not add my thoughts to it.
---
Bethesda released FO76 in November of last year and while in Beta, many players felt the game was really buggy but thought the issues would be fixed on release day especially when it was released for the average release price of $60. They weren‚Äôt and people were upset and other controversies happened between then and now. 
---
This is a buildup of frustration from Fallout fans on what is being viewed as a cash grab. Fallout 1st, the new membership platform is asking for $13/month or $99/year for a lot of the same features everyone had in the last installment, Fallout 4. The fact that a lot of promises were made and then not handled appropriately is causing both new and long term fans to question what is going on. When you add up the costs, those who purchased the game at or near release are now being upsold on a $100 membership for prior installment features, making the game cost an upwards of $160 (without Atomic Shop purchases).
---
Ultimately, supporters say the game has a beautiful design, they appreciate Bethesda‚Äôs work and that it is worth the cost for them. Non-supporters are very unhappy and view this as a cash grab.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10 that worked for me but it was on my phone. Might work for you. And its all good. Everyone gets mad.
---
Yeah definitely Frat row, there is an entire room dedicated to Nuka Cola and usually has one of every bottle on the shelf along with all the cups and collectibles
---
I should buy the max atoms and ask for a refund and so it everyday it was fun till they Sayed they where going to add utility bs
---
Not defending Bethesda as much as condemning such... immature responses
---
See there's your problem right there: you thought the video game company that is notorious for releasing buggy games who have a history of not fixing it themselves would actually fix their buggy games by themselves.
---
I could certainly see this sort of optimism for a game developer that's just getting started but Bethesda making buggy as crap games and doing nothing to fix said bugs ( sometimes even making them worse ) is... kind of their resume, their "credit score" if you will.
---
I respect your optimism but in this case... I believe you may have bet on the wrong horse my friend. :P
---
No, Bethesda did a HUGE goof.  They finally integrated private servers and unlimited scrap storage into the game...as long as you're willing to pay $100 a year for it.  Otherwise you get access to neither of those new features.
---
Thank you u have a good one man
---
Love this. People don't understand how ridiculous the higher-ups are in their demands, both time and money-wise. The devs are doing their best and I can't wait to see what they have for us next.
---
You are using all the whiner's posts as your proof, ok then double down on the slippery slope fallacy.  Well ok then, obviously no reasonable discussion can be had here.  Good evening.
---
Well go fuck Todd in the butt then?
---
I uninstalled a few days ago and i didn't realize how much it sucked. I had some great memories with some friends on the game and convinced a few others to play because it was getting better. Hitting that "uninstall" option was very bittersweet. I'm really worried about how Elder Scrolls VI is going to turn out, if it even does now that Bethesda has gone full EA...
---
Can confirm.
---
That does the trick, those 8 pieces are gone from my scrap box.
---
LMAOOOOOOO you are truly special. Imagine thinking people who keylog are "heroes". Imagine thinking you need to cheat to own a Laser Musket. Imagine being so dumb you think this is the work of a keylogger. Wow.
---
No, what you are doing is a straw man. The previous comment was merely pointing out that most frustration stems from Bethesda locking QOL updates behind a pay wall. You have no response to counter that point so you interject the issue of scrap storage. No where did OP or the previous comment mention anything about the scrap box, that‚Äôs just the only argument you can actual counter so you had to work it in somewhere.
---
A note to think about: have you ever played a fallout game where you have spawned/collected a bunch of weapons, and put them in a stash box of some sort for storage/ put them in your inventory? Have you noticed how horribly the game runs or how inconsistent the frame rate is, or how long it takes to bring up the menu to access the items? Imagine that, but multiply it by 30 people per server. Do you see how it‚Äôs a server issue?
---
Ok, bye
---
Once you use the serum, you get the mutation and the side effect of it is dampened for a while (I think it's one hour for the dampening). For Marsupial, the -Int doesn't kick in until then. The mutation can be removed by Rad Away and Decontamination Arches and suppressed for a while by Rad X. There is a Luck perk, Starched Genes, that prevents it from being removed when maxed out. There is another Luck Perk, Class Freak, that minimizes the negative effects of mutations.
---
Edit. Diluted Rad X does not suppress the mutation. So if you need Rad protection, use the diluted stuff.
---
Oh no, dont leave!
---
Its not 100 rendered peices of steel. Its a table entry. Steel-X. I would be very surprised to hear that writing 10 or 10,000 next to it would add any stress on the server. Kinda feel like I'm validated in that assumption by the fact that they are offering unlimited junk storage.
---
We are paying for more resources. So they can utilize that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Pay wall?
---
In
---
Was there tonight in blast zone.  Did seem brighter and somewhat more open.  Old house was still there as were Supermutants.  Also kept being attacked by SB's while in there, before they didn't attack once I entered the Grove.  Also seemed to be far more enemies of all types, including SB's between Watoga Station and Blast Zone than before.  Killed two 1\* Legendary SB's on the way in for real crap 1\* drops. Probably five other SB's attacking me together with Cave Crickets, Super Mutants, Scorched, Vengeful Mothmen , Ghouls and Wendigo.
---
To be fair, mule shuffling on 2-3 accounts translates to more work than any state‚Äôs minimum wage to pass the sub for FO1st. The benefit it doesn‚Äôt give is the option to make 7k caps per account in vendor clearing daily.
---
Alrighty then, multiplatform... Thank you for helping out, it's appreciated.
---
The worst part is that this subscription proves how much they‚Äôve been lying. For starters, the scrap limit was a lie this whole time. Not only that, but having a base and a camp isn‚Äôt as difficult as they claimed. Plus, this isn‚Äôt the result of a couple days worth of work. They‚Äôve been planning this since before the ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only rescinding our promise of no pay to win because YOU want it‚Äù announcement, just like all their other pay to win mechanics. Bethesda has been lying to us since day 1, and unfortunately it‚Äôs too late to save this game. But we need to call them out, and we need vote with out dollars and not support this crap. If Bethesda want‚Äôs to alienate their main audience to make money off of a few whales, then let them burn their company.
---
I dunno, they keep trying to vomit a way to charge modders for the privilege of modding their games and modders keep shoving that shit right back down their throats. Steam paid mods, creation club, whatever other garbage they're doing... I don't think many ( if any ) people have been keen on it.
---
... and from what I'm gathering, I don't think anybody is keen on this particular scam either.
---
To add to this, make sure starched genes is max rank. Class freak isn't required, but it helps with negative mutation effects. Also, don't take rad x if you have mutations, it suppresses them for a bit.
---
Bethesda didn't create fallout.
---
yeah even with magazines or bobbleheads
---
I‚Äôm a West Virginian so I‚Äôm naturally drawn to it as a Fallout fan as well, but honestly, the features I‚Äôm getting from all this is ok in my opinion. No matter what was said or promised, things change...it‚Äôs an industry and if I‚Äôm enjoying myself, I don‚Äôt need to justify paying the monthly fee to do it...I‚Äôve sat back and laughed at the salty tears all day long. The game didn‚Äôt change at all for those who don‚Äôt want to pay the subscription...so either play or don‚Äôt. I do appreciate your approach to this though.
---
And on this point, you obviously don‚Äôt fully understand what logical fallacies are. Bethesda clearly baited in consumer with the promise of a perpetually updated game at no extra cost to the player, then switched their stance to make way for locking gameplay systems and mechanics behind a subscription/ season pass service.
---
You too bud. Hope it works out for you. :)
---
Paying a single dime for that service is telling them that lying to their customers is totally fine. The people who do it are scum and contributing to the downfall of the gaming industry as a whole.
---
The comment I originally replied to didn‚Äôt blame people for paying more money for trying to hope something in this game works. It‚Äôs not logical to pay more for something that doesn‚Äôt work unless it‚Äôs a repair. So this is where the term ‚Äúglutton for punishment‚Äù would be most appropriate to describe those who are not to be blamed for paying even more than they have for something that... just works.. or should work.
---
&gt;  When the owner leaves their Private World, it will remain active if at least one guest is a Fallout 1st member, otherwise, the game begins a shutdown timer, notifying all players before removing them at the end of the countdown.
---
Probably need a pay walls for that to
---
They charging y‚Äôall to keep the servers online for a dead game at this point
---
Ya half these kids havent played in 8 months but come talking like experts all of the sudden, dont even bother lol. So its mostly happening from resetting game from dashboard while in a server or if you blue screen, infinite load screen. One guy had it happen by just moving his camp üôà
---
Hrm ... sounds like they maybe ... I dunno ... Should've used a proper game engine to handle that instead of hamstringing people for 100 bucks a year to have a feature that literally any other competent game handles without issue.
---
Yes, no problem.
---
Hopefully they can fix it quickly.
---
Would have to have a loading loop and lose all my scrap.
---
For now I'll either grab it all before I load out or in, or just not use the scrap box.
---
The subscription service
---
Same reason vendor items take up camp budget
---
Me too, fuckin love this game
---
Sorry someone downvoted you answering my question. Thank you for your seconding this opinion. I can't wait to get back on and play. Getting to level 50 a few weeks back finally made things more even keeled for me!
---
Other than storage increases what possible QOL improvements are locked behind a pay wall.
---
Adding it to the potential list
---
can‚Äôt wait to start using fallout 1st
---
Well then your statement was wrong
---
OP you might want to edit your link to this:
---
http://falloutfirst.com/?utm_source=post&amp;utm_medium=reddit&amp;utm_name=fo76 so we don't accidentally screw up the domain owner's google analytics tracking. ;)
---
Hahahaha. Exactly word for word what i expected you to say. Thanks for the laugh before bed.
---
1: she
---
2: key loggers record strikes on keyboard. Just cause someone use it to steal all the cheaters stuff doesn't mean it's tied to fo76 in any way. If you get one every button you press is recorded. Then you back track and see what they were logging into. It's pretty bad if this is the case.
---
Trouble ticket, you will get a refund. I‚Äôm speaking from experience. They even let me keep the item I bought by accident.
---
Guy asking if there's legal consequence to a corporation having blatantly lied about the product it sold: malicious.
---
Corporation having blatantly lied about the product it sold: worth defending apparently??
---
Hmm. Guess we just learned quite a bit about your moral compass.
---
edit: elaborated
---
Todd Howard's butt and is behind a paywall premium of $2.99 a month or $199.99 a year. Thank you for your butt fuckin!
---
Oh it's dying, you'll have your own private servers no matter what because nobody will be playing any more. The only people playing are the ones who support hot garbage and think it has value. The tasteless and smug, enjoy your private server, Fallout 1st member or not.
---
People just seethe that others are playing it, and love when the devs do anything, which they then spin in a bad light. I don't know why some people just hate, all the time. I wish they would just leave the game to those that enjoy the core, but that's much too much to ask.
---
Not to mention I cited my source as to why it's not a bait and switch. So I actually engaged with two points.
---
This is what happens when you support assholes.
---
You buy their 'dlc' and turns out you got Fucked in the ass hmm this sounds familiar "Bethesda" lol oh well they got it money that's all they wanted
---
Sweet
---
why Bethesda can't do a survey like that ?! it's not hard and shoes what people really want or think !
---
Without putting in time to quote on mobile, why do you think people continue to play AND spend money on the game?  It‚Äôs quite possible to have played since beta and never put another dime into Bethesda‚Äôs coffers.
---
this is my favorite game. it runs flawlessly for me. i honestly just can‚Äôt grasp why anyone hates it, it‚Äôs a bethesda game. a fun online adventure.
---
all of you who still play this game are like a bunch of cucks
---
See and that's the thing, I've repeatedly tried all of these, besides blue screening, and nothing occurs so exactly how much junk do you have to have in the scrap box for it to occur
---
Can't forget lube support
---
But you have things like laser musket? Some friends.
---
That's a extra 5.99$
---
But, but, it just works!
---
They still offer plenty of updates for free. Hate to say it but it's not a bait and switch.
---
ALL HAIL LAMPBOI
---
^^^Also ^^^no
---
I checked it this sub to see if they fixed all the issues which made me uninstall...  
---
   
---
Convinced me to purchase outer worlds instead. Enjoying it a lot more so far!
---
No this is a he, is that really something you care about? And key loggers wont corrupt characters, if you'd like to provide some evidence of a keylogger corrupting someones fo76 character, I'd love to see it.
---
Yes! In hindsight they should have, but this was an issue brought up when they rushed a game out almost two years ago to beat the hype of Red Dead 2. They should‚Äôve used at least the current engine, but they used the one prior to Fallout 4‚Äôs release. None of this has any relevance to the topic at hand though, don‚Äôt you think? This thread is about WHY you still enjoy the game at this point. Not arguing about engine differences and problems, etc.
---
For now scrap storage, private sessions, scrap kits, and a second free fast travel point. All of which by the way were community ideas that I believe are on the Bethesda Please list. And if you had read the last ITV, you would realize that they said they planned to add more gameplay effecting items into the Atomic Shop.
---
That‚Äôs a solid 7, right there.
---
I haven‚Äôt played in a while so I‚Äôm out of the loop. What‚Äôs with the fridge and the robot?
---
What‚Äôs this update about having to spend Atoms?
---
Paying a little cash for a private server?  Sure (even though many other games let you do it for free).  But $100 dollars a year is fucking highway robbery.  Not to mention that fact that you're also being forced to pay to increase your storage limit.
---
I just wish the new weapons got ported over to FO4
---
What do they win?
---
Imagine being a cunt who has banned/not released items and thinking anyone fucking cares about your account. Nice try kathy.
---
Dude same been playing for the last several weeks really been enjoying it then this...it's a total disconnect from a legitimate gaming experience it's like it just came out of freaking beta...in all honesty I would congratulate them on there new game but there to cocky/stupid to put stuff that should have been in game and not stuck behind paywalls while I agree that skins and such are cool and whatever something's should just be directly apart of a game like this like the infinite junk stash and or refrigerator oya how about the scavenger bot? Nope no can do grats on the fuck up y'all truly I would buy the skins no problem some are actually really cool but being put in a position where you have to choose skins over stuff that could look cool in your house/base is absurd on a online store basis keep it simple one tracked
---
Please keep raising hell by stating common sense to these brainlets. They need to understand that if they want to get fucked so brutally up the ass, there are plenty of gay dudes way more than eager to do it for a much cheaper price than Todd and squad.
---
It's called commodities, "kiddo". Learn the difference.
---
I do agree, this community gets more and more toxic.
---
Its all good, downvotes on reddit doesn't mean anything to me
---
It would make sense for them to implement a monthly free skin
---
Hit t or x on your favorites wheel
---
Search this sub 2 days back. Before the shit storm brigade. Good post about it!
---
To the outer rim!
---
I honestly never thought I would see this post on this sub. We've defended this game for a looooong time. Through good and bad we've defended it. Just shows you how fucking bad things got with just one patch. Jesus Christ Bethesda what have you done?
---
THIS IS NOT SARCASM .I am a long time fallout fan, played all the games, and I started FO76 a month ago, Im all ready lvl 95 and I actualy really LOVE THE GAME. Fallout 76 is one of the best experiences in gaming I ever had, I always wished for an online game like FO3 or Skyrim or FO4, ESO didint cut it for me tho I played it for 2 years, it was a completely different engine and it did not feel like Skyrim at all. On the other hand FO76 is just like I imagined i would want an online Fallout game, I really like how the game engine feels and looks. It actually made me finally buy a really good gaming PC. So basically for FO76 alone I spent more then a thousand of euros so I could improve my amazing experience even more, thats how great this game feels for me. I am a guy who reads books and loves lore in games, so the no NPC thing was not a terrible thing for me, I loved listening holotapes and reading terminals to learn the main story of the game, it is actualy very very good and interesting AF! I actually didn‚Äôt get any game breaking bugs while I played even on my lame ass old pc, on my new one it runs like a dream!!! The only thing Im really sad about is the removal of Survival mode, that one I loved, all new challenge to the game when you can be killed any time by other players, cant wait for it to come back.

So I love this game so much that I will continue to support it and spend my money on atoms and cosmetics that I like just to do my part in keeping this game alive, I cant lose this one, it just feels like this game was made exactly for my taste. I truly believe the game will make a huge comeback with wastelanders, I believe in this game, and cant wait to see what the future holds.
---
I see these comments every time
---
Turns out they aren't reactionary knee jerk opinions because it keeps getting worse.
---
I have
---
These are the dumbass's that fund Bethesda to keep reeming you lot.
---
It only make sense to stop playing and to go back to fo1,2,3,nv. Or to pay $1.06 for a month of outer worlds just to let betha think about what they did while watching there player count drop and hopefully fix it by the time the one month is up
---
That post was someones account getting stolen, not corrupted
---
1000% no reason to defend Bugthesda anymore.
---
They literally had no effect on this decision, chill
---
Thanks God we have you people around being so woken up when it comes to these silly matters. Aw man, the hirony.
---
It came out today. It‚Äôs very good.
---
Lol... yeah, the projection was strong with that one.
---
And baited again. They'll charge you $10 more to get it back
---
Not so bad!
---
Certainly not the same people who finance micro transactions and who push companies like EA into p2w shenanigans. Companies do what make profit. The responsability beyond to the buyers. But enjoy, you will still enjoy this crap without taking your responsabilities when future Bethesda games will only be mtx, loot boxes and p2w in mobile-like shitty games.
---
This game is trash and anyone who plays it is rewarding Bethesda and begging for more trash games. It boggles the mind how this game still has a playerbase. This is why the industry is such a shitshow, people continue to buy and play games no matter how bad, continue to support terrible business practices and unfinished releases. I hate the people who play Fallout 76 because they contribute to making Bethesda and gaming as a whole worse.
---
WTF? Who even are you? My name isn't Kathy you fucking idiot, and I'm a guy not a girl. GTFO
---
Bethesda doesn't care if updates work or not. As we can see, idiots are still buying it, no matter what. The backlash doesn't matter. The majority of player will high likely buy the premium membership.
---
It should be more common than it is with how many disconnects we get..possibly triggered by certain types of junk idk really
---
stop your greedy shittalk its like 50 cents a day whats that these days,look in your own wallet!!!if u cant afford 50 cent a day u should take a job
---
I kinda do, but there are some who go out of their way and spend a lot of time on details.  I've been taking pictures of camps I come across that are just beautiful to look at.  It makes a better loading screen.
---
What I should of also done is to write the owner's name down So I could find them again.  I'll do that from now on.
---
I did on the day it came out...havent regretted it yet.  I spend more on booze and tobacco and i enjoy the game way more.
---
Don't get me wrong, I do understand your point. And you are right about what they said at first. And believe me, I wish they would focus a little more on free content too. Hopefully there's no hard feelings. It was fun discussing this. Have fun out there.
---
I did it, no scrap deleted
---
I wasn't really wrong though? They did seem to be fixing age old bugs from past games. They just stopped trying at some point.
---
And as someone that has perfectly normal experiences playing there games without mods I find the buggy complaints to seem overblown. So it didn't really seem like it was that crazy.
---
If you were dumb enough to get BGS your money you deserve this!
---
I remember how hyped I was when the teaser came out and the idea we could have all the u.s in a mmorpg.
---
Kappa?
---
&gt;Or, they delayed Wastelanders to make it better?
---
I was referring to this specific comment that appears to show you defending Bethesda. It might be true that they are delaying Wastelanders to make it better. But considering their history, it is more likely that Bethesda just screwed up and prioritized the falloutfirst launch.
---
Or again maybe I'm wrong. But we have to honestly consider which is more likely given what we already know about Bethesda as an entity?
---
Such immature responses will exist, and tbh they sometimes serve as a interesting medium to spread awareness in this context of f076 situation since you are more likely to share the falloutfirst guy's website than a block of text. And again, I don't agree with the falloutfirst guy's response but I do see its merits.
---
100 dollars justified üòéüëç
---
You guys are getting ripped off, I don‚Äôt understand how this is even acceptable or likable
---
YOURE PAYING 100 EXTRA DOLLARS A YEAR FOR SOMETHING YOU ALREADY PAID FOR
---
I bought the $300 power armor edition.
---
I can say I did get my moneys worth out of it even with all the problems I encountered.
---
Who are you to decide how much space is "enough" for each player?
---
This explains the ‚ÄúBattle Royal‚Äù mode, and why they‚Äôve dropped it and Survival after just a few months. It‚Äôs clear they expected Survival mode to bring in the big spenders, and when that failed they thought Nuclear Winter would be what brought them in. When the larger player base lost interest in both modes, Bethesda simply just abandoned the mode and moved on to the next ‚ÄúMoney maker‚Äù. The worst part is, if they‚Äôd simply stick with the original game and just add improvements and new features, FOR FREE, then the Whales would be coming in force. But they‚Äôre simply trying to make a quick buck off this game, and it‚Äôs too obviously showing.
---
Should've known better
---
I don't hate the game, I think it's super fun. I just hate that Bethesda tells us they're gonna give us one thing and then gives us a half-assed thing and an apology.
---
Slippery Slope fallacy applies when two ideas are unrelated and there is not a motive to connect the two

Gay marriage -&gt; Bestiality is one commonly suggested by the Alt Right but people supporting Gay Marriage do not have a motive to support Bestiality. 
---
Stuff like cosmetics  -&gt; Pay to win share the same motive of $$
---
You can earn the atoms for scrap kits. And a second free fast travel point is hardly a game changer. I have yet to not have caps to fast travel past the first five hours. Not to mention if you play on a team you potentially have five free fast travel points. Private sessions should cost a fee. And fallout in adventure mode is so one sided anyway only selling perks or legendaries would have a profound impact on other players.
---
Basically they originally promised only cosmetic items would be monetized. Then they released a fridge that slows down spoilage on food items behind a pay wall as well as a robot that collects scrap.
---
Right, but what am I winning here?  What am I winning over you? The ability to hold 5000 screws or of anything when I could originally hold 700 screws with all other mats ranging from 50-300 units.  I mean just how many screws do you need? How often is your gear breaking?
---
And what if their metric is bugged too ?
---
That fact that you supported this game in the 1st place should bothers you more!
---
This needs more upvotes. Screw you guys who downvoted him, you are ruining gaming.
---
HA $60?! I‚Äôm sorry but if you payed $60 for ESO recently then you‚Äôve been swizzed. It costs like $25 for the base game plus the four starting DLC‚Äôs and Morrowind
---
At least someone appreciates my work.
---
Don‚Äôt buy it
---
Ever
---
I think there's a bit of a distinction between a premium service and a paywall, but No one is going to change your mind. You want to be angry, because you think everyone else is angry, so you will make any excuse to remain upset.
---
Yeah, of course. I wasn't expecting them to get paid.
---
Recruited then, Mr Pedantic.

The sex tent is summoned by grabbing your ankles and shouting "Thank you Todd, may I buy another?"

Laser Muskets don't mean shit, one of the most popular fo76 youtubers literally made a video using one and his account is fine: https://youtu.be/AMlhgJp4wBQ can you understand that Kyle?
---
More like $13
---
It‚Äôs players like yourself and other whales giving these developers a reason to rip people off. You accept the half developed trash they produce and what do they do? Keep developing trash, because you just can‚Äôt stop supporting them. Waste your cash bud, outer worlds looks amazing atm, at least I don‚Äôt have to pay to play with broken content üëçüèª
---
&gt; trading with players turs them into a stashbox 
---
That is so stupid it goes around to being almost impressive. Trading with players turns them into a stashbox... how does this even happen? How?
---
Just give 1$ to microsoft and profit imo
---
Check out the Filthy Casuals sub. A lot less toxicity.
---
This game isn‚Äôt worth it
---
In all honesty it's  simply terrible business practicing I mean look at the last of us a sequel was teased years ago and still to this the hype is intense why cuz we don't give to fucks about how long the development time is if it's good and can draw us in to a point non gamers go and snatch a system to try your game your succeeding these companies bethesda EA Activision are attempting to race each other to steal the others base consumers in concept it's absurd idea why not let your employees pour heart and soul into a game and truly allow them to send it to there fans with great anticipation to the opinion of the people who play it cuz they know they did there best there was nothing more they could do to make it a better experience instead of saying you have 2 years on average to build a concept get it into working order build it work out the bugs then test it then race to make a trailer showing a game there not 100% confident in then race to try to fix things they didn't have time to fix before being forced to launch it all the while deadlines on dlc also and you guessed it back to the grind of the next one talking about a ultimate burnout out on consumers as well as devs working these projects time is needed for quality assurance and max income and a steady player base
---
Lol well damn
---
The calm post in the shitty storm of whining
---
Lvl 15 lowest lvl to do it I believe, but nice!
---
Probably just a bunch of nutso kids mad their sociopath simulator mode got canned.
---
We forgive you mate.
---
Nice sneaky edit there. And there you go again, reading way deeper into something than necessary. You‚Äôre putting way too much effort into this man. I don‚Äôt know a damn thing about you so I can‚Äôt judge you as a person but if you‚Äôre anything like this in real life, yikes.
---
I think it is. $60 for 590 hrs. More worthy than most open world games to me.
---
Yup, I'm done here.
---
I mean... She has dev room weapons. Kinda not weird if you ask me. Show me the player with legit grindout everyday shit that has this happen.
---
She's a cheater.
---
Fucking A. Should only have been able to EARN the repair kits. Should of been a drop from legendaries only. Just from killing the Queen I usually have about 20ish of the upgraded ones that do more than the store bought ones. WTF is the point of even having them on the store?
---
That's messed up, to think though, Fallout 4 still has issues that were never even looked at being patched, but they still release CC crap all the time. Ah, Boston DT Lag, only fixable with a load of tweaks and mods...
---
Dam
---
Thank you or solstice for the gold.
---
To see how people react
---
Yes and I still play almost everyday
---
Got a link? Keep hearing about this one but cant find anything past august.
---
Kyle look buddy, not every person with a laser musket is a cheater, you need to understand this. You do not need to cheat, or hack to get one at the moment.
---
Sounds like PR when you say it isn‚Äôt for everyone. Nothing is for everyone. Obviously.
---
You saying Ark doesn't give you 1600 atoms and unlimited storage is like me saying Fallout's subscription sucks because they don't give you a permanent double XP buff, a monthly loot promo code, early access to events, and everything else the Ark subscription service gives. 
---
Furthermore, only Ark Mobile has a subscription pass and guess what? Ark Mobile is actually free. Not only is Bethesda asking players to pay full price for the game but their subscription service is priced 3x higher than Ark's. 
---
Lastly, you probably know this by now but Bethesda's private worlds and unlimited storage aren't even working properly. Maybe Bethesda should focus more on fixing their already broken game instead of asking fans to pay for more broken services.
---
This analogy really fell apart somewhere.
---
Yeah agree that is on them. They should have been open from day 1. Hopefully they stop that now and just stay open about what FO76 is. A MMO Lite game in a fallout universe with all the MTX and premium services associated with other MMO Lite games.
---
Outer worlds, Skyrim, far cry series
---
All absolutely superior games to this trash fire
---
I don‚Äôt mean to bash your interest in this game, I just don‚Äôt find this level of quality acceptable. I also hate it when people bend over backwards for Bethesda and spend 100$ DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A GAME YOU ALREADY BOUGHT
---
&gt;Too bad they fucked up and had the scrap box already in the game pre beta for free but decided to say "yeah its causing performance issues" when they realised they could just sell it later on.
---
That is complete bullshit. Show your proof. Scrap was never the issue with performance , it's only an object with a quantity value. The server doesn't care if you have 1 spring or 10K springs, it takes exactly the same memory.  What does have impact unique items in your stash: weapons, armor, aid, etc. 
---
Show your proof of the scrap box in pre-beta. You won't because you can't.
---
Idk I got 8000 hours out of Skyrim and fucking love the dishonored games. They make great games, shit fo76 could have been a great game. I played it and loved the core game idea. They just didn‚Äôt do it right, needed at least 2 more years of development and it could have been such an amazing game. They chose greed over true quality and that says a lot about a company. Maybe they will choose to continue this path into the future and become another shit company, but from a studio that has always been so strong, I hope this is just a huge fluke and they actually learn that people won‚Äôt be fucked over for low quality games
---
Some people are losing their junk yes, per Bethesda.

---
I love how you people think you're clever, but you all sound like you just became aware of these practices "yesterday."
---
Lol. Everybody hates this fallout 1st tho, so can't blame em
---
Just move on, it‚Äôs not going to get better.
---
Yeah, but it‚Äôs not entirely Todd‚Äôs fault. We should put the blame on the parent company.
---
I actually wanted to see how to Communitys Mind set is on the matter since I was actually hyped about Wastelanders.
---
Stopped playing some time ago but after the recent News I really wanted to know If the Community is aware of the problems that will happen If they support this money grabbing Tactic.
---
In the end there will always be some people who really sink HUNDEREDS of Dollars into this practice. And Bethesda will see this as a Oppurtunity to maybe implement this into future Games... Because IT PRINTS MONEY - for low effort work.
---
 *Subjectively
---
Ironic
---
I totally agree with OW and ESS, however Far Cry? First, I bough both 5 and ND. Second, I don‚Äôt even have the interest and motivation To at least finish it. Far Cry to me, is the most boring open world game I‚Äôve ever played. That 10 hour combined is what called a wasted money. And I don‚Äôt think my 590hrs of FO76 is like that. If so it will never got to 590hrs.
---
Bloodied. Yes not as popular as comando but with the right gauss/black powder everything but high end is a one shot.
---
Lever is a nice rate of fire for your everyday omce spotted.
---
And ditch two shot. The accuracy is wank and 2 bullets for around 66% is not ideal when you got one bullet.
---
Instigating will wreck almost all pve and bloodied does the same with every shot.. Not just the first.
---
Exactly....great post
---
This reminds me of that scene from that movie Big Fat Liar where that dude tried to drive his car and every knob and pedal does something wrong.
---
Found it [lol](https://youtu.be/fki-LTswICw)
---
You really paying for that shit? Alright I guess I'll stop arguing with you
---
Yeah. Bethesda screwed up big time with this
---
Well I guess the thing that always happens when you no longer pay for a service. You can't use it anymore.
---
But with the scrapbox, there have been rumors that you do get to keep it, you just can't put any more stuff in it. You can only take stuff out until the box is empty. Rumors, though, we can only know what really happens in a month once the first subs run out...
---
I can't speak for everyone, but I only spent once and it was before even repair kits crept up. Been thumping my anti-p2w bible since repair kits, and made sure to disconnect my credit card for good measure.
---
After all; If you're not playing how you preach, then why should anyone give a shit what you say
---
Furious ffr Fixer primed...what i use
---
Sounds like his opinion to me. Just like that sounds like yours. Let go of the hate my friend.
---
And what Special is Starched Genes and Class freak
---
Better bring an umbrella because im spitting on them.
---
Tbh, I pay about $10 a month for a private server on Conan Exiles, for the same reason; My girlfriend and I like to play on our own private world. But the Conan world is persistent, we can build a lot more, we can put in any mod we find in the steam workshop, and it's password protected.
---
I get there is a place for Fallout One, but I don't think the current design and price are right.
---
Far Cry 3 is one of my favorite games of all time, 
---
4 was okay
---
5, well 5 exists but it was funny with coop
---
I admire your dedication in all honesty, I just wish this game was so much better so I could enjoy it with some friends,
---
Yeah, I said this several times, never got any traction until after it happened lol
---
If you consider 15 Euro / month "whaling" then you might wanna find another job.
---
But anyway, you do you. If you don't like it go play Outer Worlds and stop whining around here.
---
Preferably with mics!
---
I‚Äôm happy to spend money as long as it actually made me happy instead of bored. Or why am I earning money? Money should spend on happiness , isn‚Äôt that how it suppose to work? Have a happy life? Everyone gain happiness in different ways. You called people who spend money in their prefer way ‚Äúbent‚Äù? Then they can say the exact same to you if they don‚Äôt like the content you maybe enjoyed. So what‚Äôs the meaning or point on this?
---
This is very refreshing after the last 24 hrs
---
uphill both ways, though, such is life
---
Bethesda are geniuses at find new and fascinating ways to [fuck up](http://falloutfirst.com).
---
Last good Fallout was NV I commend you bro BOYCOTT BETHESDA!
---
I've bought one bundle as the atom store prices are ridiculous. But the server is a good deal.
---
Yeah but why, why they keep making this game more easy to hate lol.
---
Id be lying if I said I never encountered any bugs, or being dropped from a server. And I can understand the frustration from folks who pre-ordered this game/bought it full price, whereas I came upon it free from buying an Xbox.
---
I guess from not being a long time fallout player there is alot I don't understand.
---
I am probably living in the honey moon phase that most Bethesda fans existed in years ago when their favorite versions of fallout came to be. Friends tell me to play New Vegas- and I once tried fo3 but it was way too hard for me.
---
I'm 31, and also a female. I haven't gamed since N64 as a kid at sleep overs (Smash Bros/Donkey Kong), &amp; picked it up recently as stress relief. 
---
Ive really enjoyed every thing so far and find it really user friendly. Hopefully it doesn't change too much for people like myself who are just finding out how great gaming can be
---
At this very moment, putting anything in the stash deletes it.
---
The silo was relatively okay, like 3 second delay when replacing a mainframe core. The laser grids were also delayed similarly. Only the launch prep got stuck.
---
 üëç
---
&gt; all our content
---
fair enough, they make you pay for mod support
---
Yes me too. The game could be so much better and I can enjoy it far more than 590hrs if so. However that doesn‚Äôt mean the game is not worth it. There‚Äôre surely people like me and actually many with higher level than me out there on the map.
---
If you have hate in your heart, let it out
---
If you only knew how utterly wrong you were.
---
But you know, have a meltdown and let your emotions guide your ability to think clearly.
---
They....they can't even competently manage a website? Fucking high school IT kids can do that.
---
Yep... this will be 3-in-1, first, last and only time

Ok. That's pretty cool

Does instigating still only do 110 max? rofl

Edit: not that you'll respond to me, but I meant for pvp

I just took out of luck last level :(
---
And you know it xD
---
Nice. Im almost 190 and just got there. Going to find the codes so i keep missing my weekly.
---
Once its done the way game intended then its Google for codes and 3 pete on the queen. I have so many cards.
---
I agreed... seriously what else does Bethesda need to do to lose these people trust?
---
Meh, stop being a fallout shill and realise it‚Äôs not what it was. All I‚Äôm saying is people like you have assisted these devs/publishers in allowing broken games and features on release because you spend when they open their mouths. We should have you to thank for allowing this behaviour with your wallet, cheers Bethesda cuck ‚úåüèª

I have to say, I‚Äôm a bit disappointed that I didn‚Äôt receive an essay about why my comment sucked. At the same time, that was your least pretentious response yet. Good job

Not really. Unless your a YouTube sub. Then i guess brain washing does amazing things.

I'm mostly annoyed at how BGS Austin is being scapegoated for all of F76's sins.  The above commenter did place some of the blame on Zenimax, which I can't rule out, but ended with a blanket absolvement of BGS MD/Todd Howard.  This just feels extremely dishonest to me.  It feels like mental gymnastics being performed so fans can maintain hope for future BGS MD titles like Starfield and TESVI.
---
But the truth of the matter is that BGS MD did develop this game and maintains creative control over it.  As the executive producer of BGS MD and the lead director in charge of F76's development, The Todd should have had significant control over just about everything to do with F76.  Well, except for marketing I suppose, but as the face of BGS he was definitely front and center promoting it. Regardless, The Todd has either been puppeted by the evil corporate suits at Zenimax, or is trying to sell us more goddamn horse armor.  The state F76 shipped in (all the bugs, not just the monetization) should be a massive red flag for anything the studio puts out in the future. We can't just throw BGS Austin under the bus and pretend nothing went wrong. BGS MD did make F76, so they share in it's blame.  They've either been compromised or lost their way.  It happens (look at literally any studio under EA), but to pretend nothing is wrong is just being delusional. So when I see Austin being scapegoated for F76, I can't help but see someone burying their head in the sand.  I get a bit triggered/carried away.... &gt;.&gt;
---
Stop trying to whore out karma
---
Both are under luck:)
---
Well since you asked for my opinion on the service! Lol naw im just kidding. Basically they haven't given any specifics about future content regarding fallout first. As usual from bathesda. They did say that there would be more coming specific to the service however. What form it will take who knows. IMHO, 12.99 for all of this stuff is the best value yet from bathesda. Definitely cheaper than ONE POWER ARMOR SKIN. You can always get the current stuff then unsubscribe. If they release something later that you want just subscribe again for another month. Im fairly certain they wont turn down your money.
---
Good to hear!
---
Nintendo is great (except for their mobile department), and even Ubisoft seems to actually be getting better at the moment. even if they're still far from perfect. Microsoft and Square are pretty good as well and Valve is making games again, though probably primarily smaller stuff and big VR projects for the time being. And don't discount indies, they're higher quality now than they've ever been.
---
2-3
---
But was one of the best comment threads on Reddit in years.
---
&gt;Devs most likely will not see any of this money.
---
Don't be silly, employees are the biggest expense or any corporation and IT are on the very high end of that cost. I'm a developer lead on a team 12 devs, SDETs and analysts. By far us developers are the highest paid, nearly 2:1 in most cases
---
I'm sure I will get it. Or not, who cares. I don't lose anything either way. It's just an addendum and no story content, not important, just for convenience.
---
And it's none of your business what others do with their money you stupid huge baby xD
---
Yes I am pretty sure everyone is so upset because they are concerned with capitalism and the long term consequences of our actions on corporations behaviour.
---
Not because you didn't get a stupid tent for free, ahah. /s
---
No. It's not.
---
&gt;  unique items but not overpowered or unobtainable through normal means
---
Did you not read this part? 
---
Unstoppable monster is a perfect example. It was a good weapon. But not a god roll. Weekly rewards would be in the scope of unstoppable monster which may or may not even be viable for your build. Good rolls not god rolls. 
---
There was nothing in any of the survival weapons that was unique to them. No stat or prefix that wasn't unobtainable regularly through drops or purveyor.  If what your getting is not even guaranteed to be a benefit to you, you still have to work to get it, and the absolute equivalent, or even potentially better versions are available through normal means, then it is by no means in any interpretation pay to win.  
---
They may be "unique" items but they are not unique to the game. Being unique to the game and not being available by other means is what makes pay to win. Case and point.  Fridge, gather bot, scrapbox, fast travel tent.
---
And that's just the weekly rewards.  The monthly rewards would be by doing those wild wasteland miniquest/challenges that would reward in "schematics for these cosmetic technological marvels".  Think Liberty prime armor, fuzzy ride, ect.  Plenty of room here for unique cosmetics available only through the challenges. Which are only available through the subscription.
---
Basically it's more end game quests and more rewards. Which again are not pay to win so long as two conditions are followed to the letter:  No god rolls. Nothing "truly" unique, that effects game play and cannot be acquired normally. 
---
As long as those two rules are followed it would never be pay to win.  It would be "pay to do something other than grind the normal grinding methods,  while still progressing, and EARNING unique cosmetics along the way."
---
I‚Äôm sure I will at least subscribe for a month for the ranger armor and emotes and icons. That all looks nice. I‚Äôm wondering if I should opt in for more months, expecting more cool stuff.
---
I know this is controversial, but I am still interested in what Fallout 1st has to offer.
---
Bring up your favorites wheel and on the bottom of the screen it will tell you which button to push. Had the same issue, the way they described it i thought it would be on the wheel.
---
ya, it is amazing how much bugestha can pushed the boundary and keep getting away with it.
---
Wish I knew about this Rad X suppression 20 minutes ago when I used it for the first time fighting the queen and had no idea why I couldn't jump up on ANYTHING!
---
And there‚Äôs one thing you ignored. Yes, you can put games on scale and technically look at their quality. But I think games as art, there‚Äôre low and high arts. It‚Äôs the same, art is abstract and different than for example computers, you just look and compare technical specs. The Outer worlds has better scores, quality and missions. However TOW doesn‚Äôt have that 50s golden age vacuum tube post apocalypse art style none the maps, the stories scattered in the wasteland. Skyrim, is a middle age magic and dragon game. That‚Äôs completely different when it comes to these things. While 76 doesn‚Äôt have the good quality, it‚Äôs art style and world setting is unique and nowhere to find. That‚Äôs why they cannot repalce each other and you cannot think simply because one is technically better than people should not enjoy the worse one. Because there‚Äôre no true comparison when it comes to art. All are subject to tastes.
---
&gt;sucks some cause commotion though
---
Don't let the Reddit raiders get to you! They're like other raiders just geekier and more passive-aggressive than aggressive. üëçüòÇ
---
is there any quality control with these releases at all? how do you fuck up private servers this badly?
---
Have you tried paying 99.99$?

skyrim is already just a cash grab. it is marginally better executed than fallout 4, but nonetheless it has very little built on top of oblivion which itself was a step back from morrowind, with copypasted content, reused enemies questlines and whatnot. notice how all the stuff you do hardly correlates with the world and different places in these games, npc largely unaware of anything happening beyond the two lines they give you for their own little quests. it was lacking any real depth in worldbuilding, which is kind of big if you are building a rpg.
---
fallout 3 already had some of these issues at its core already evident, so I hold the purchase, but I got in because of obsidian's new vegas showing someone still loved the franchise and its lore.
---
It actually haven't dropped at all, but anyway I don't measure myself through the amount of Karma on my Reddit, differently than all these people who keep reiterating the same old stuff just to get their 30 seconds of fame.
---
##HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
They know about it and can replicate it.  They just haven't found a solution yet.
---
Mods will be pay to use regardless of if they bring back the Creation Club or not because you will only be able to use them on the private servers that cost $100 a year to access.
---
I've beaten dark souls and bloodborne numerous times and I always go back because it's an excellent game
---
I left Fo76 because the community were a bunch of carebears never letting the game become more like Rust, but coming back and seeing this, i have to say ..this is a new low.
---
All hail our benevolent leader Todd!
---
I also have Fallout 1 and 2 and played through each of them several times, and the same with FNV, F3 and F4. What is happening now with F76 and Bethesda hurts... I am worried about the future games they will release as well.
---
Bethesda is the new Konami.
---
By paying 99.99$
---
people insist that "slippery slope" is a logical fallacy. the world around us disagrees.
---
Purchased it because I wanted to get the atoms...... it is cheaper to get the private server with the atoms. I understand math is hard for you so my condolences.
---
Lmao this makes you happy?
---
No it is thier business. Reddit is a socialist hub. Whats yours is community.
---
Yea I‚Äôm sorry my friend...I was just trying to be positive and give folks hope of getting thier stuff back 
---
(Positivity gets downvoted in this sub lol...don‚Äôt think it was you but still, pretty funny)
---
I don't really have issues with the Service itself. The Servers have to be paid for, to be sure.
---
My problem is the pricing. You can simply not afford to be more expensive than World of Warcraft (I think the Xbox game pass and PSN has been mentioned more than enough) with only a fraction of the perceived features plus the fact that the only real benefit is the added stash space (as we already know, the private worlds thing seems to be nothing more than a recycling of older worlds)
---
If it was cheaper I would maybe consider it. But that pricing model is broken and they have to know about it.
---
Add bill2million im always down to launch some nukes
---
Hey I started listening after reading your and people like you‚Äôs arguments about those kits
---
I will say I did think people were crazy during the unstoppable outfit one won‚Äôt lie
---
I believe Starched Genes needs only 2 points if maxed; however, Class Freak does require 3 points. Thus, only 5 points in Luck are required :)
---
There‚Äôs nothing about this that isn‚Äôt an advertisement. And Bethesda didn‚Äôt even have to pay for it. 4-D chess, indeed.
---
Username checks out
---
I get that you're quick to point out a cheater, but a keylogger would just claim some login details.  Tell me, if they logged in to the op's account, how did they acieve this result?  Everyone who got hacked just lost their items I assume, no transformations and impossible items were just created that I read about anyway.  I just dont see how a keylogger would do this to anything...
---
On the months i played this game (stopped for lack of content and interresting things to do) i spend roughly 15e a month on atoms. When and if i come back (most likely when wastelanders finally comes out) i would most likely spend the same'ish amount. So subscribing for me is a win. I pay the same and get the same amount of atoms and get the other stuff on Fallout 1st as a bonus. 15e for me, as a working adult, is nothing for a hobby/thing i like to do.
---
Happy Halloween fellow Vault Dwellers!
---
It seemed pretty clear to me after reading the press release that the private server is new and still developing tech. Adjustments and additions are on the way.
---
Here. Currently have a military themed base atm. Not a lot of items to work with, but I manage. I hate camp builds that overuse items and have plants in a motherfucking mothman themed build. Really ticks me off
---
Awww cheers mate, all the best from Melbourne :)
---
I have the plans for most of the costumes and spent today going around dropping them off at camps for free. Brought me some chuckles from the reactions i got.
---
Ya I'm sure the quality of life improvements locked behind the paywall didn't factor in at all...wut a joke.
---
Thanks! Helped me out today!
---
Theory: It has been speculated on that private worlds are just adventure servers that have been "reallocated" to only allow a specific fallout 1st member access. As far as the non-Fallout 1st player staying on the server forever, it is possible that once the F1st member leaves the server it just "reallocates" itself back to being a plain adventure server, thus allowing the non-member player to stay indefinitely while not *technically* being "private". Someone would have to wait and see if a private world becomes populated with random players after the member leaves to be sure of that.
---
I actually extracted the armor textures myself to find most of this info but some are in [this Datamine](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm0ep5/patch_14_atx_update/).
---
Kinda makes me wonder if Bethesda is even working on fo76 anymore.
---
It‚Äôs been such a shit show that I wonder if Bethesda left fo76 a year ago to work on elder scrolls and some other developers took over fo76.
---
Kinda like how bioware had a different team for mass effect andromeda(that was fail team alpha) while the real bioware team was..........idk.....they weren‚Äôt working on anthem....that‚Äôs for sure. 7 years I f development and they only spent 1 year working.
---
Just store it in the scrapbox.
---
I do enjoy the stash box. It is great
---
They succumbed way back in 2002 when (((Altman))) pushed out Weaver from Bethesda.
---
Beats me. Popped into my inventory once I got corrupted
---
&gt;That's exactly what it is, its working perfectly now, Thanks that was driving me nuts
---
Who cares if there's more monetization? If I don't want it, I don't buy in. If I do, then I do. 
---
The difference between myself and you? For you? If you want it .... It should be free.
---
You're boring. All you do is repeat one liners with emojiis at the end like a broken facebook bot. I think I'll block you and enjoy the fact that you'll never get the chance to try and make a comeback. Suck on that, incel üòÇüññüèæ
---
I'm going to agree with you because I wasn't 100% sure to begin with. :) I knew Class Freak was 3 but Starched was foggy.
---
Junk. Junk never changes.
---
Bethesda doesn't care what you guys think. In fact, the very first idiots already got a 1st Membership and now cry about bugs.
---
Bethesda can do what they want, no matter the backlash. PEOPLE WILL BUY IT. And Bethesda makes a ton of money with it. This is how it has been ever since. I have no respect for the people who buy it.
---
Yeah some people don't realize that. Somebody needs to make it happen and to keep it happening. That somebody prolly has a family and themselves to feeed. That somebody will not do it for free. 
---
Coding and creating doesn't fall from the sky.
---
They don't give a damn. They know there's always going to be people as autistic as you buying their turds. This shit's been fucked since at least 2006.
---
Popular is a loose term around here.
---
Yes, but the planets themself are not open world either. Nor seem to feature any kind of vast spaces to explore .....
---
It's not a breaking criticism. Just an aspect I would have loved to see considering NV.
---
You are not getting Private Servers, you are getting Private Worlds. There is a difference. They are not hosted on your computer. When Fo76 first came out, people complained that 24 players on a map were too low and that the servers can't handle any more people. Now you are basically paying Bethesda to lower that number to zero (max 7 players). I have never withness such customer "bend over" in my life.
---
If you pay a subscription for this game you're a fucking idiot.
---
Right, that'd be fine, except the way "private servers" work right now, Bethesda's hosting all of them, and they're not going to just let anyone upload assets for them to serve.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/370339/missing-scrap-in-scrapbox?language%5B%5D=en
---
I feel the same I don't even know amymore I just stuck with a feeling of emptiness....
---
How fucking stupid are you really not to be angry about a blatant cash grab subscription service? Seek help.
---
Everything does 110 max. But thats per hit. If you can't aim commando is there for you.
---
Also TS counts as 2 hits for explosive. 220 damage on the spot for a fatman.
---
Much testing. No fireproof 3 and dense anymore. It caps at 90% meaning that unless you healthnis bumped... You are dead.
---
Did you pay 99.99? If not please do so
---
The bug. Not survival. 
---
I don't give 76 a light slap on the wrist. It launched buggy as hell and still has issues. I luckily haven't had as buggy experience as most, but still had my fair share. 
---
But as someone who has gotten all the Fallout games at launch, and a few ES games, I was fairly confident that 76 would at best be a slightly less buggy launch and at worst more buggy than normal.
---
So I wasn't outraged with the pretty expected level of bugs. It's not ideal, but I love Fallout. Do I deal with the buggy launches or not play the games? Turns out I love fallout enough to deal with the buggy launch history.
---
Well, thanks mate. I‚Äôve just had a look and can confirm that only 5 points are required. On another note, Starched Genes perk cards are only available from Level 30 onwards; Class Freak from Level 46 onwards.
---
I got fallout first and i love it. The price is literally less per month than one frikkin power armor skin. I said it in another post, this is the first actual decently priced package from bathesda for this game. If peeps are screaming about the cost then i think they prolly just like to scream.
---
However.
---
Bathesda has got to learn how to read the room man. The scrap kit should have went into the base game. They know it, we know it. Idk what they are thinking. Or at the very least the tent or the outfit should have been free or even worse at least available in the atom shop. I have one friend that plays the game who hasn't bought the service. All the rest have. I bet the next announcement from bathesda will be that fallout first is a hit. And this time i think they will be telling the truth.
---
You should never be hesitant to use slippery slope arguments against corporations, especially AAA gaming ones with shit integrity like Bethesda. You give them an inch, and they'll take a mile. Fallout 76 has been a complete disaster since launch and there are somehow people still defending it, saying that 'it's a whole lot better now!'. I hate how we've come to accept this standard of waiting nearly a whole year after release for games to be 'playable and good'. They should be that way at launch. We're not paying for bloody betas or early access.
---
Yes they are. Or are knowingly a part of it. The hope is that they pass it on so they can track these fucktards.
---
Ah the fanboys who‚Äôll support the death of Bethesda rather than making them stand to a higher standard have all gathered here I see.
---
I dislike that, too. Though to be fair, I can see why they did it. Would be way too easy to exploit the stash space if you could  just put every single weapon on a display or into the vendor with no weight penalty
---
Greed. Greed never changes.
---
I still want and know they can do better.
---
If you think the game is truly great and everyone else is wrong you're living in your own little fantasy world.
---
I enjoy the game. Bought it at full price and I'd even dare say I managed to get my money's worth pretty quickly. I still hop on from time to time to dick around with a couple of friends. 
---
The exploration's fun. I'm a sucker for anything with base building. Those two things basically sealed the deal for me. That said, I don't care for most of the things in the atom shop and don't have interest in the subscription.
---
Its gonna be a miracle if civilization last 30 years
---
Quick question.... is this anonymous?
---
Never happened to me so I'm good. Got 1k of every scrap now and 8k steel. If next months outfit an sales are good for 1st members I'll keep  the membership and get a year. Also got doom eternal collector's edition pre ordered too and it comes with doom 64 for free. The unlimited scrap box is really nice. Feels like playing f4 again and having unlimited scrap cause I collected every piece of junk in every location on the map.
---
That‚Äôs good to hear but be careful with your junk, the scrap box has a glitch rn that deletes your stuff!
---
Oh, I doubt they have the same thoughts behind those comments.
---
Turns out the quality of mtx seem to ebb and flow if you actually pay attention with Bethesdas history of DLC and mtx.
---
This isn't a linear issue.
---
The sub perks are currently convenience and not currently p2w. If you think they are, why? 
---
Don't tell me it's not a kneejerk by how the previous persons responded to my other comment.
---
I can't believe some people are still playing, yet alone some are paying the $100 dollar subscription
---
Like I wouldn't believe people like that exist if it wasn't for this subreddit
---
To add further, RadShield is, IMO, the best way to gain Rad Resistance when in Nuke Zones. It provides you with the Resistance, while leaving Mutations unaffected. Put simply, Rad X does the same thing, but suppresses Mutation effects, while RadShield gives you the ‚Äòbest of both worlds‚Äô :)
---
Giving credit where it's due, I literally mean the worlds Bethesda's devs built rather than the IP (Fallout, Elder Scrolls, etc.). Exploring Skyrim, FO4, 76...all very enjoyable. The level of detail is second only to CDPR's work in the witcher series IMO. Those same BGS games' plots, dialogue, etc? Not so much.
---
You're not playing on private servers, you're playing on normal servers that have no players.
---
Tbh i didn't like FO3 that much my first bethesda game was NV and I loved it. Had never heard of the franchise but i saw it on sell and my 13 year old mind was like yeah this guy looks sick. 
---
FO3 felt extremely empty to me and i never have finished it all the way through. Compared to NV it bored me a little bit. (Loved that reputation system with factions)
---
FO4 was a blast. The announcement was so insane to me. I had no clue it was coming and boom it dropped in November!! I was lucky enough to not experience any game breaking bugs. Im not blind to the lack of story and meaningful choices. The dialog sucked but i enjoyed the voiced protagonist after getting used to it. The graphics arent up to par with other games this generation but it looked pretty great to me.
---
. . . and .
---
Beth put a lot of money to FO76. Buying Warcry studios to make it wasn't probably cheap and now all they can see is to make more money to justify this strategy.
---
These are people with 1000‚Äôs of each scrap material. Likely in 4-5 digits of scrap box weight.
---
Being pissed off seems like a pretty appropriate reaction given the games track record though
---
I saved my money for modern warfare
---
Pretty simple. Quality of life changes should never be locked behind paywalls period. From the beginning cosmetics were suppose to be the only pay to obtain content. Paying for servers is fine but paying so u can make the game less obnoxious is not fine. Those features were ripped right off of the forums from day 1.
---
/u/Mistah_Blue Same, it feels like New Vegas in space in all the right and good ways. The dialog tree is perfect and the dialog has me in stitches.
---
You don't need neither of what's offered with those 100$, you can still literally continue playing just like you did a week ago when you were happy, nobody took anything away from those 60$ you spent an year ago. 
---
So I don't see where your complaints are coming from other than being a first world problem.
---
so you are paying extra for single player lol
---
Yeah well....
---
Horse Armor...
---
Yeah, but people squeal as soon as they hear this kind of suggestion
---
Before the max damage limit I used a dragon to put out serious dmg, all rifle perks, bloody mess, put a lot in luck and agility and run a bloodied build. In Luck you want to have perks that do crit dmg
---
I can't believe it took you a year to see what others saw when they played the beta. I hope you don't fall for this shit again. You've wasted your life playing a game that knowingly lied to you. Bugthesda aren't a company worth your trust.
---
Do you have a link to a bloodied build I could use as a guide? And I do have a dragon but it‚Äôs just broken and I have no ammo
---
That's right, forgot about that! 300 rad resistance for 15 minutes. I stupidly don't use it enough haha
---
Reading his responses and the way he defended himself, he easily went on long enough to become a villain.
---
Bethesda resorting to shills now to save their pathetic asses lmao.
---
Until further notice it is still a Fallout sub, not Gordon Ramsey fan club.
---
Beth Austin AKA Warcry studios is working with FO76.
---
Thanks i hope it is a visual bug as i added new junk recently after seeing no junk in the box
---
Not a link but I can build one real quick
---
Alright thanks
---
You enjoy supporting super fucking shady corporate practices too.
---
u/ladydevann u/valseek
---
... those games are designed for extended replay value.. control is not... 
---
Go play nothing but Bioshock 1 for the next month or two months.. replay it over and over again with no deviation..
---
Not every game is a hamster wheel. Lordy what has Live Service done to you kids?
---
&gt;It's the old saying, when you think you are the most die hard fan, think again, because there is another more die hard fan that is already dead.
---
Tbh.. Its too late. Consoles were the focus of obvlion. Money wise it's the right move. I like all of their multiplayer games tho. Single player is and has been gone since that launch.
---
At least i have people to mingle with... Unlike fo4. Holy cow what is that game? Like they had it all planned out to be multiplayer but at the last seconds hired some actors to voice. Games a loot by your self fuckfest. No rpg in it at all. Give me friends if this is the best you can do.
---
I haven't deleted just yet, but if/when I do, that's how I'm going out as well. People want my stuff, they can grind for it just like I have to grind for atoms in order to not have to listen to people telling me "iT's NoT mY fAuLt YoU dOn'T sPeNd AlL yOuR lImItEd GaMe TiMe GrInDiNg FoR aToMs InStEaD oF jUsT pLaYiNg ThE gAmE aNd HaViNg FuN!'
---
We recreated the issue on Xbox with video proof: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmrw54/scrapbox_users_dashboarding_while_loading_into_a
---
And no, this is NOT visual only.
---
BGS MD left as soon as the game launched, yes.  They ofiicially announced full production of Starfield was starting as F76 was shipping.  They did leave staff behind and retain creative control of F76, however, so all these shenanigans are either their ideas or ones they tacitly approved of.  
---
They may very well have stopped carring and written F76 off as a lost cause, though.  Either counting on brand loyalty/hoping people forget by the time Starfield launches, or banking on people throwing BGS Austin under the bus for it.  Which listening to people on this sub.... the later seems to be happening.
---
I think it depends on how long this game limps on for before they shoot it in the back of the head. If Wastelanders turns out to be amazing and revitalizes interest in the game (doubtful at this point) then we could be looking at a few years and a few more big DLCs before they move on. No way they'll release F5 if F76 is still making decent money. If the game goes on life support more than it already is, I think we could expect F5 not long after ES6.
---
I‚Äôm going to combine all three of the comments so we aren‚Äôt going back and forth in three different places.
---
First to your point about citing your source. I can cite anything I want, for example I could say that you are an asshole and cite [this](https://rentarecruiter.nz/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Asshole.jpeg)  image. Does that mean that I am correct in what I said prior? You can cite anyone or anything, but if you don‚Äôt apply that information to your conversation it is as useless as me linking you to a randomly generated search result. You said nothing as to why Bethesda‚Äôs actions couldn‚Äôt be considered bait and switch, just simply provided a definition of the word.
---
To you point about countering two points, you are the party that introduced the topic of the scrap box and unlimited storage for components. You then proceeded to counter the point you introduced (your straw man) instead of actually refuting anything the user had said prior. The reply to your original content was simply pointing out that the majority of those upset didn‚Äôt have an issue with paying for a private server, but the fact that Bethesda was locking new content behind a service model.
---
Second to your point that Bethesda‚Äôs actions were not bait and switch:
---
Bait:
---
‚ÄúAll the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,‚Äù explains Hines; ‚Äúall the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That‚Äôs important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there‚Äôs a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we‚Äôre going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you‚Äôre getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I‚Äôm getting that stuff for free. That feels right.‚Äù - Pete Hines [Source](https://www.vgr.com/fallout-76-microtransactions-hines/) 
---
Switch:
---
‚ÄúOur approach to these items at launch was to keep them purely cosmetic. But after looking at all the data, it became clear that to consistently deliver content that keeps Fallout 76 fresh and exciting for all, we needed to rethink our approach to the Atomic Shop‚Äù - Bethesda Game Studios [Source](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/6eNqXDms6VbtrHubE26y4r/new-wastelanders-release-date-private-worlds-the-atomic-shop-and-more) 
---
And finally, to the your above comment. Yes, I will concede that scrap kits may be purchasable her earning Atoms, their main purpose in the rwm shop is to generate revenue. I find it hard to believe that even you think people would spend hard earned atoms on scrap kits instead of cosmetic items. And a second free fast travel point is a huge buff for solo players. It allows you to spread three points across the map that can drastically reduce the cost of fast traveling. And again, one of the main criticisms of both of these features was that they were taken from mostly from community ideas, repackaged, and sold back to the community.
---
‚ÄúPrivate sessions should cost a fee‚Äù is your opinion, not fact. To most this had been a long requested feature and in its current implementation appears to have cost Bethesda nothing (this is referring to the discovery that private worlds are just recycled adventure worlds). Had they release support for player run private servers, or offered mod support and special settings for your own world I would personally be more inclined to concede that they were somewhat justified in charging, but they didn‚Äôt. They are nothing more than your own locked adventure server.
---
Right. Seemed like firing my weapon was also keeping my AP down. I was fighting a beast in a nuke zone so I had to keep firing.
---
This is what I think is happening, and I am NOT defending the practice:
---
Yes, I think used servers exist. They exist because it's part of the load-balancing done at the AWS end. An unknown number of servers are initially spawned and booted up, and are then distributed on "first come, first served" basis. If there are more Fallout 1st subscribers than servers, another batch of servers are spawned and booted up. During the time that the new servers boot up, Fallout 1st subscribers will notice generic "server not available" type of messages, or might notice a longer than usual load time for the game. But as the number of subscribers settle, the load-balancing kicks in. New FO1st players will inherit old server instances left behind by previous FO1st players, as this probably allows for shorter load times (and most likely also cost-beneficial at Bethesda's end, but I'm not an expert on AWS server instances and on whether there is a cost to shut down and boot up a brand new server, or whether reusing a server instance is free, etc).
---
It makes perfect sense from a technical standpoint. Load-balancing is a ubiquitous practice across many IT services and organizations. But there are humans in flesh and blood involved in the system. We don't (and won't) perceive inheriting a used server as a benefit to us. Players expect a fresh server, and rightfully so if they're paying for it. Would this mean that the cost for the subscription would be prohibitively high? Sure, but that's Bethesda corporate's problem. 
---
Now to my rant:
---
There is also a long-running issue at hand: Bethesda's lack of transparency. They're already perceived as a bunch of boomer capitalists sitting around a table, making decisions that continuously offend their player-base, with contracted and understaffed development team slaving away far from corporate HQ, with the sweetest community manager that is sacrificed on an alter and has to shield corporate from the shit given by the community. (Again, this is the general perception, after me reading post after post across a diverse number of FO76 subs.) It also seems like Bethesda corporate is so out of touch with their player-base that they decide to release Fallout 1st days before the release of Outer Worlds. Who in their unmatched wisdom made that decision? I will be playing Outer Worlds, that's a given. Not because of these issues, but because I'm not married to FO76 and this is not the only game I play. It's not "Fallout76 1st" for me. And come on, a lot of old Fallout players like me are hemorrhaging and frothing nostalgia right now.
---
I'm a filthy casual (most of you know us). I'm not fazed by atoms or refrigerators or scrap kits or repair kits (I only bought Atoms once, and that was because I had ran out of free Atoms and really wanted Liberty Prime) and I'm frankly too casual to make the foolish decision to buy a subscription when I don't even play that much. But when a corporation is out of touch with their player-base and ignores the human in the system during their cost-benefit calculations, resulting in weird practices, it irks me. It makes it personal and the issue moves into the domain of philosophical principles. From a macro standpoint, these type of practices (i.e. ignoring the human in the system) is everything that's wrong with the real world. I love their games because it raises important issues we experience in society (wars, the military industrial complex, the oppression of the weak, unethical and immoral practices, etc). But I find it highly ironic that they're now perceived as one of the many unethical and immoral corporations depicted in their own games. An epic own goal scored deliberately and aggressively. What the fuck is going on over there in Maryland?
---
Nice troll, you caught people who took the bait
---
I'm buying my copy used. Was considering repurchasing FO3, NV, and 4 for PC directly from Bethesda so I can mod them more than is possible on XBox (completely impossible for 3 and NV, limited to 2gbs of mods for 4), but now I'll be buying those used as well.
---
I only noticed it with my gatling tho. Handmade was not reducing AP. If that's the case, my BE Gatling is going up for sale
---
I Think you're under the impression that you will be able to mod the game via "Private Servers"
---
Make no mistake, these servers are NOT running on your end.
---
They STILL want you to buy stupid micro transactions, even in private servers and modding will END that.
---
This game will NEVER be open for modding.
---
So modding is not behind a paywall....there is no modding. Period.
---
I use a TSE handmade aswell, here's my tips:

Get mutations/starched genes. Adrenal Reaction adds 100 Damage Per shot or so..

They aren't what people expected for private servers though.  These are just instances and not true private servers.  Bethesda trying to take people for a ride.

saved money for modern warfare,

let me fix it for you, I saved a little money until the reviews are out and then they will add the p2w mechanics. 
---
i think thats better lmao.

Oh no the people supporting locking quality of life changes behind a paywall are now suffering...that makes me super happy to hear. I hope they also get the bug that deletes their character. You sellout to Bethesda you deserve the trashy experience.

Nothing shady about it.
---
I actually love the game. Thats why. I bought the game full price. I dont mind paying more if its worth it. I guess its like this. I used to be a wild man when i was younger, drank everything in sight, sleep with whoever was nice enough to agree to it, if someone started a fight i would smile and get after it. But as ive gotten older and calmed down my main source of entertainment is gaming. Amd i love this game, bugs and all. I dont like bathesda very much right now but i do love 76.
---
$12.99 per month. That is less than two IPA's down at the bar. I get all of these items plus a private world for about the same price as a pack of cigarettes. This is the only thing ive bought so far from fo76. The robot and fridge are way overpriced so i didnt buy them. The ridiculously priced power armor skins should be illegal. So i didnt buy them. And i never will unless the price drops. Fallout First? Its an amazing deal. So i bought it.
---
So to summarize; ive gotten over 1000 hours of entertainment playing a game i love for 60 dollars. Now ill prolly get a 1000 more for 12.99 a month. Thats why. I do not expect my entertainment to be free.
---
But the scrap kit should be in the base game and some part of the first package maybe the outfit should have been a free gift to the loyal fanbase. Or the tent. Bathesda are straight up fucking morons for releasing it this way. Idiots.
---
I mean i get ya man i refuse to pay 99.99 when i can pay 12x12=144 each year. Give more support

You are just mad because you can't afford the costume, aren't you?
---
Yea, but this definitely isn't the first time something like this has happened... even to triple A developers.
---
...but I see where you're coming from.
---
10.99 and you get a trailer tomorrow
---
Im a noob drunk dad if you wanna add me lol. Greatfulcook is my psn
---
I need to tell Angry Joe about this. He will make dolphin noises from the laughter.
---
I hear what you're saying and I basically agree; but I think I have a different outlook on the game that allows me to still enjoy it or at least get frustrated in a different way.
---
I decided about 3-4 months ago to try to collect all the outfits.  I hit a wall with the last 10 or so and still need most of them.  Then I moved on to the plans.  It's absurd, as some of them may or may not even exist; but it gives me something to do and when I do find something I need it's great.  Today I got the Ultracite Gatling plan as a drop; got the Tomahawk a few weeks ago.  
---
I doubt I'll ever get 'everything' in the game, but searching for it leads me back to places I just ran through and events I always overlooked.  I got the Ultracite Gat plan from the event 'Monster Mash' today; while also actually playing it with someone as a Pvp thing.  We messaged after with tips on our builds, etc., was a nice surprise.
---
In the end; 76 is no different than any other Fallout game for me.  I always end up trying to do everything possible and in the case of FO4 every possible ending.  There is so much to see and find out there; look past the goofy masks and at worst you have a world to explore.
---
Yea someone posted that's it's because they log off before your char safed the infos. Dropping any item from your char should force it to safe, he wrote.
---
You can tell theres nothing wrong about it by looking at all the non-existant outrage. Oh wait
---
Rest assured, even those who pay 100$ still won't be able to mod the game.
---
Bloodied build is just to radiate yourself to under 20% and wear unyielding armor. Lots of special stats then and nerd rage kick in.
---
To maximize it you would need a weapon with Bloody effect, but those are hard to get... Your TSE is a very good second pick.
---
I bought it on sale just to shut my kid up and i actually liked it a bit. So, yeah.
---
Yes I own a car, a house, have a bank account, go to the doctor.......etc. I even have a pair of NIKE shoes lol. Oh and am using comcast internet. Dont enjoy it but welcome to living in a civilization that you dont have to shit in the street. Think before you speak
---
It just works.
---
The slippery slope fallacy was only ever a fallacy if there was no proof to back it up.
---
That's just twisting words. You pay extra for something you didn't have yesterday, and didn't need, but today you do because everyone else has it. And you don't want to pay so you whine over here. So you are just like everyone else, but without money to spend.
---
I do run a drug  Bloodied Gauss  sniper ( mostly vats to match team mates automatic weapons )

---
Unyelding gear gives me almost 500 actions points, i focus on stealth ultralight gear ( drug mod on chest ) "Grim's reaper" i use urban under armor ( 3 str 2 perception )
---
Mutations are up to your taste, i skipped defense as you're not supposed to take a hit ( Serendipidy is a decent option ) Speed demon is a obligation tho, Having to reload cuts off your dps by a extreme number and makes you vulnerable.
---
Quality of life perks in ranks 3 since you will mostly carry 120 unit of toxic goo, water on shortcut as both healing/drinking purpose, a lots of drugs ( Psychotats or Calmex ( maybe overdrive, your choice )
---
i do strongly consider using a laserotron head to charge a few rads instead of goo, just need to find a -90%W one ( beware, they are not silenced weapons you could bring yourself unwanted attention...)
---
Revenant perk is excellent, and maybe overkill for anything else than ScorchQueen.
---
A gauss with 33 aim in vats is very reliable once you're used to it, other gauss may and will miss too often...
---
Sorry for my wall of text and my english :D hope those helps, if i missed something i'll edit later.
---
Vats critical are too weak to build yourself around them if you don't have a specific weapon in my taste, i use them to secure my hits when i don't feel sure i'll hit the target at huge ranges ( Flying ones mostly )
---
At least our world is made of fun and games rather than whiny kids that didn't get their outfit for free.
---
Just a big nope on most of this. Inifite stash was a community mod in fo4 well before ESO was released. 
---
They did in fact talk about not have a subscription service in at least 2 interviews I know of. Like i said in different comment very easy to google and find out for yourself
---
People thought private worlds would be free because they promised free content. I agree thinking that was a mistake by a lot of people
---
It does seem that it is a good deal for you. I'm legitimately glad that it works out for the needs of you and your family. The issue is that everyone else who it isn't a good deal for are basically left with two options: pay for a subscription service that they don't want/need or lose out on two features that they may want to have. And who knows what will be a "1st exclusive" in the future that we will also miss out on for not being subscribed to this service. 
---
Also, it sounds like you probably don't care about playing with mods, but this service doesn't bode well at all for those of us that were hoping for advanced mods and mod servers with more than 8 players. The way they've set this up is about the worst way possible for mod users, creators, and those looking to play these mods with friends. I'm willing to bet these servers will also never allow any advanced mods, especially with how they're bundling the atoms with it. It makes it seem like mods are going to be limited, possibly that we will have to pay for them, and we'll have to download and install them from the atom shop so they'll be curated.
---
But seriously, I'm glad the game turned out how you like it. Just sucks for those of us who were expecting something different with this game. All my hopes for it have been dashed, beyond just the unethical stuff they're doing.
---
SMH... every so often I check the boards to see what I've missed the past 4 months and to determine whether FO76 is worth coming back to... and every time I do there always seems to be some new and head scratching bug(s) that makes me thankful for having stopped playing back in June. Good luck to all of you still hanging in there and sticking it out or just staying the course.
---
it cause you edit esm. self promotion edit cheating?
---
This is so sad. Alexa, play Somebody That I Used to Know by Gotye.
---
*takes fat rip of juul*
---
&gt;so can you maybe give 2-3 examples how this is screwing us all over? i just try to understand
---
Diablo 3 with the real money auction house was incredibly bad, and it was made possible by the people who were willing to pay. Couple years later, Star wars Battlefront tried to push gameplay enhancing loot boxes that would have completely ruined the experience for non-paying users, but  fortunately the backlash was so intense that they were forced to remove the loot boxes altogether. Then you have overwatch that forces you to buy tons of randomized lootboxes instead of being able to simply buy the skins you want. All of those things made the games worse, and were allowed to exist because some people were willing to pay.
---
The *only* reason why private games and unlimited scrap space are not available for free is because Bethesda thinks enough people are willing to pay for it. If more people decided to put their foot down, then Bethesda wouldn't be able to be as greedy and we would all greatly benefit from it.
---
&gt;but the stuff that is locked behind extra payment isn't really necessary to have fun in the game? and the people who pay for it wont have the ability to screw your personal experience with the game.
---
Having unlimited scrap space + fast travel point is a big game changer, that people have been requesting since the very beginning. Now that it's a paid option, we know the base game will never have it, even though it's already in the game. That means the base game is intentionally kept just a little bit worse than the paid version in order to sell subscriptions.
---
I don't know about you, but having games made less enjoyable *on purpose* in order to sell features that should be *completely free* pretty much fits my definition of being screwed over.
---
\- 60$ game that was explicitly supposed to have FREE DLC and COSMETIC cash shop items only suddenly comes out with an overpriced subscription service.
---
\- Said service is not only barebones in terms of features, but also dysfunctional. (major issue)
---
\- Being as expensive as it is points towards more Fallout 1st exclusive gameplay content coming in the future.
---
\- The gameplay experience is no longer unified across the board. You now have to shell out nearly double the full price of the game each YEAR in order to unlock all gameplay features. (tents allowing you to drag your whole stash wherever you go and scrap boxes for piling up infinite crafting resources)
---
If you don't see the problem, I don't know what to say. I bought this game specifically because it was specifically advertised as something that requires a one time purchase to enjoy all its gameplay features throughout its lifespan. That's a fucking fantastic deal! Except now they want me to pay 100$ on top of that.
---
What does any of that have to do with going out of your way to support a company that lied to you?
---
Wouldn't that help the stash and server problems?
---
what? I use an unedited ESM
---
Yeah man I agree. They have totally turned me off. I can only imagine what they‚Äôre gonna do with the elder scrolls.
---
Throw it on the pile
---
just play outer worlds and get over yourself OP.
---
Am√©n, $14 ain't nothing. It's a lunch at burger king. I'm going to sub yearly, but I'm going to test the waters until the end of 2019.
---
^
---
I think we were just in a game together lol but yeah!
---
Agreed
---
Bethesda: yeah we changed it. You're lucky we didnt change the deal even more!.. Cause we will.
---
Assuming people who didn't buy it can't afford it. I can afford a yearly subscription right now but I won't do it. Know why? Because I have a brain to not support a greedy company. Stop being stupid and assuming people who don't want it can't afford it, you sound like an idiot.
---
You clearly used. and data saved edited statue before patch. that's cause this happens after patch
---
your now self promotion on reddit "i'm cheater"
---
See the point a lot of us were trying make is that it's been VERY VERY clear especially the past 3 years or so, that if you give any of these game companies an inch , they will always go the extra mile. Just like how Bethesda keeps saying "these are widely asked for features", yet i have never not once seen anyone directly ask to be charged for the stuff they have put in the game. Someone asks for a QOL feature and says nothing about paying for it, the normal thing to do (especially considering how this game launched and how let down the community was mostly) would be to make it seem like you want to make them happy playing the game, but nah, you need to pay for that son.
---
Do they need to be p2w to be problematic?
---
Being unable to afford a costume after I paid $60+ to play this game shouldn't even be a thing, considering the quality of this game, or lack thereof, so fuck your logic
---
Critic: your game sucks and is filled with bugs! I can't support you if you're not going to listen to your community after we've been so patient for so long
---
One of 10 people that still plays 76: you're just jealous :P
---
&gt; Just because you get upset when I call out your hypocrisy doesn't mean you have to have a tantrum.
---
Interesting coming from someone who regularly gets called out for shilling, trolling, and your own hypocrisy
---
At the end of the secret passage (inside the Lucky Hole Mine) there are a few more Crystal deposits to grab in the water!

Wait wut... are you saying Dark Souls/Bloodborne are live service games?
---
Lol i was idle eating this amazing steak
---
This
---
Those companies all lie, all companies "lie", because they're not your mommy, they want money. That this needs to be spelled out to this whole sub is pretty funny tbh.
---
Yea but its like twitter outrage. No one takes it or the people seriously. To me it's all a joke like Bethesda and this sub.
---
So you can't, if you want I can buy it for you?
---
lol x lol = lol^2
---
They don't know what they want this game to be seriously it's obvious. First it's a survival game, then it's a pvp focused game, then it's a looter shooter, then it's a battle royale, then it's a sub based mmo (with 24 players omegalul)and wastelanders will be them trying to go back to the fallout we wanted from the start when they could have implemented NPC's in the first DLC if they wanted. They have ported of many assets for fallout 4 there is no reason why they couldn't have done so with an NPC or something, they have no shame anywhere else in the game.
---
Everyone who works on fallout 76 should seriously go and play the outer worlds and seriously look at what it is that we loved so much about the franchise and just how far 76 is from that, i was absolutely fine with a multiplayer fallout , in all honesty i was hype when they announced it. The fact is everything has been a let down for me with this game just about, the nukes maybe being the only exception and they only were cool for the first week or so of doing them. Obsidian has knocked it out of the park with outer worlds, it has a color and vibrant world, with a well written story and quests that are engaging with characters you actually want to know more about. All the things i used to feel about Bethesda games, i don't know a single one of the people who are in the holotapes names besides the overseer.
---
@Groggnakk oh dude that's very kind of you :) would appreciate that alot very kind indeed, thankyou man what's your gt ill add you :)
---
It's not even just one game, honestly. Fallout 4. Rage 2. Dishonored 2 Launch. Skyrim Special Edition. Skyrim dental floss edition. Blades. Wolfenstein 2. Fallout 76 stands out from the crowd though in how it manages to spit out controversy and mis-steps this far after launch.
---
Dog food and purified water.
---
Imagine somebody at Bethesda legitimately thinking that their palette swapped power armour is comparable to fornite cosmetics.   
---
FO76 and everything bethesda does with it keeps becoming more and more like r/sadcringe material.
---
I couldn't do that to you. You've been through enough, sweaty
---
I mean we..sorry they added Fallout First have you tried that yet?
---
I dont know what kinds of other companies you enjoy getting fucked by, but at least in the videogame department GGG never lied to us :)
---
The question was, why support it.
---
People still playing this game are clearly delusional.
---
Are you 6? If think Bethesda is shady and all the companies and businesses I just said are not you have a very rude awakening coming your way.
---
lmao what? I literally never said that what are you talking about? I use an unedited ESM and no mods. Completely Vanilla game. Why is everybody trying to blame me when it‚Äôs just Bethesda‚Äôs fuckup
---
It's the 2019 gaming industry way to do things:
---
If people are upset about something that's making you money, you can't apologize for it, because people might expect you to fix it and NOT make money.
---
If you can't apologize for it, nothing you say will calm people down.
---
If you can't say anything to calm people down, don't say anything, just wait for the consumer to forget the way it always does.
---
I love how people are getting upset at us for criticizing a game that WE purchased with our money.
---
I'll be in the garage.
---
What a fucking idiot.
---
Oh you must be
---
I figure most that are bitching about the subscription not being free are potheads living with their parents and/or have a minimum wage job.  Prove me wrong.  I sound like an idiot?  So.  Like i give a shit what people online think about me.
---
I like that you mentioned the **creation kit source** here, but this can be not the truth anymore. Remember what I said about them redoing the entire perspective of their engine for this game? I don't think that's in the standard source.
---
Plus, it definitely isn't just an integer that's gumming up the system here. I know they do a lot behind the scene for data validation and availability, as hackers/dupers in the past has forced their hand to add more redundancy on this data, and I believe this is one of their key constraints. A number is a number is a number, but I can see how reorienting the entire perspective of this engine is definitely causing technical difficulties that were "no way shape or form" intended for the original engine.
---
Granted, this is a issue they put themselves in, but it doesn't invalidate the response of them having a hard time with this issue.
---
As for the subscription on top of all their "screw-uppary", **I agree entirely.** It's ridiculous, but I figure it's going to die on its own because it is a crap product, or they'll improve it until it becomes financially viable. I think it's very short sighted, given how rocky the release of this game was, and to do this on the basically 1 year mark is kind of hilarious...
---
But again, I was merely pointing out your initial concern of them making up barriers for financial gain. As that does happen, I don't blame you for jumping there, but as a programmer myself, I understand how something seemingly simple can conflate at a ridiculously large rate and I only wished to convey that experience I have witnessed, into the reality of this specific situation.
---
Nope I'm a doctor I could def afford it. I just don't believe in putting hotfixes behind paywalls and people who support that don't promote healthy gaming experiences for the community as a whole.
---
Really? A lot of the reviews that came out at launch reported literally the same bugs that have been plaguing Bethesda games as early as Oblivion. Not to mention how they somehow managed to screw up their subscription thing so it is buggy as a fresh crap in the summer :P
---
Are you? I never said companies don't lie. But its been constant lies by bethesda. Why keep feeding it? I guess some people just enjoy being cucks.
---
NV with a bathtub full of money. All games are like this. People just have a hardtime letting go.
---
Sounds like crowd sourced independent developers are the future! If only that was a well established industry that has been ruining AAA gaming for the last decade.
---
Nice edit. What outrage? Where did i say they were horrible? This is where the conversation stops and i just call you a fucking idiot. Everything I have said is easy to find on google. Its dumbfucks like you that pass along misinformation
---
Lol this blatant troll got a silver. Are you fellers dumb?
---
They purchased the game, they have every right to criticize the game just how you enjoy the game and enjoy them slapping their own shit in your face and scamming you. Prove to me that people who don't want to purchase it are "pot heads living with their parents living on minimum wage." Because I'm not living on minimum wage nor do I live with my parents and I can afford dozens of these subscriptions but I won't because it's a blatant rip off. And you don't have to give any kind of shit what I think about you, but you're still a pathetic, dickless, bitching  bethesda fanboy. I take shits bigger than you, tiny.
---
&gt; Like i give a shit what people online think about me.
---
Its apparent when you publicly announce you're an idiot like that. As in, goes without saying.

well aware they didn't create it but they bought it and my first introduction before going back to Fallout 1 was Fallout 3.

We definitely will later today! :D

Wait, hold up. Was Oblivion a bad game then? I‚Äôm confused.
---
I realize you are just trolling, but would the fact that a person cannot afford this subscription make his point any less valid? You may not have issue with MTXs, but some people see those for what they are: monetized QoL improvements, because players are lazy.
---
Ur gon make me cry catjongun
---
He's been doing this for easily 6 months now. He's just a troll who doesn't give up. 
---
But watch as he calls me and everyone who calls him out a troll.
---
Fallout isn't a mmo. Eso isn't as broken as this. ESO has many expansions included on the membership, I take you hadn't played it so you are only comparing from the outside.
---
Did I say that? I didn‚Äôt. I said they‚Äôre designed for extended relay value.... which every game isn‚Äôt
---
I play it because I love it. I don't spend any money on it, other than the ps+ I have to have in order to play. I dont need or want a private server so Im unaffected in that area but I do think the subscription is over priced.
---
I still dont see how its pay to win, but then again Im not competitive so that might be why I dont get it.
---
I keep seeing people post Todd quites about free dlc and I dont see how the private servers makes what he says a lie, did I miss something?
---
Dude i've been fanning the flames for a day now and even i can say this was lame:(
---
...but you didn't have to CUUUUUUUUT ME OFF
---
Am I? The way it looks, some people have been trolling the rest of us since they were born. And yes, the fact that you cannot afford it makes your point less valid, because you are differently involved.
---
Bottom line, do what you want with the money you have, and stop complaining how others decide to spend them.
---
someBADDDDIIIIIIIIIIII din din din din dininininin
---
Oh, You big mad...
---
EA Access is cheaper than Fallout 76's subscription by like 60-80 dollars.......even though they are a shit company they don't even have the balls to pull this shit.
---
Oh fasho bruh. Mad facts üò§
---
i guess you havent played fo76 log enough, I know a ton off ppl that did cheat in game myself included and I for sure can tell you that the gear me and my friends had were more than likely dupped. 
---
BGS allowed dupping way to long as well bringing it back with every update. im not say he/she did or did not cheat. but dupped items are every where and you might have some and dont even know it.
---
ü•∫
---
I have a lot of mothman and Halloween stuff outside but my theme is a ufo. My vendors serve as the support computers in my cockpit. So while I have a somewhat spooky theme I need sci-fi looking vendors
---
Yeah, that dude is so much of a legend that he paid Bethesda a 100$ to mock them, even tho that guy paid for that scam.
---
You do realize that Bethesda is earning money from dumb people like him, right?
---
I suggest to uninstall it. Make your voice heard. Also.... Outer worlds is out now.
---
The worst part is that they ignored the hundreds of us who were providing constructive criticism, bug lists, and helpful feedback for the, sometimes single, people who said stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôd pay for a fridge‚Äù. 
---
It‚Äôs so sad since the community at the start worked so hard to see the game succeed but every month and every update was one step forward and two steps back. Whoever is in charge of this nightmare at Bethesda needs to take a serious moment and look at their performance, stop, recollect recollect themselves and not rush anymore. 
---
They keep rushing content, fixes, and responses that just dig them deeper into the hole of mistrust they‚Äôve dug for themselves. The scrap box thing which they said was ‚Äújust a display error‚Äù somehow has now turned into ‚Äúfor some players it wasn‚Äôt just a display issue and they lost their stuff‚Äù no shit. Have they not learned from the canvas bags, the data breach, the promise to not have utility items in the atom shop, the countless times players have lost items, progress, or total accounts? 
---
Why bother rushing this stuff? Have they not learned anything from their past mistakes? Anyway, I was a first day beta person who had high hopes for this game but I‚Äôd given up months ago when my power armor was all returned to my stash and I had to spend an hour walking back to my stash overencumbered with no armor. I‚Äôd hoped Wastlanders would bring me back but doesn‚Äôt look like it.
---
you have no idea what your talking about lmao.
---
I know :P I just wanna see at what point will he break. My guess is never.
---
Todd could show up to his house tomorrow, steal all his matress money, fuck his mom in the frontyard and he'd still be like "Come back tomorrow Mr. Howard, please!"
---
Who hurt you? Point em at us, we‚Äôll make it better
---
Just found it odd that you said what you said at the end in a reply about dark souls/bloodborne..
---
Very cool, what platform?
---
Not OP, but I‚Äôve just come from Outer Worlds to say that it feels like more of a Fallout game than this crock of shit üëçüèª
---
You know, I could get into collecting stuff if I was able to decorate my camp with the stuff I found like I can with mods in Fallout 4. Can't do that in F76, so it is less fun for me. Also the build limits are oppressive to say the least even if we could. 
---
Making up content for yourself has its limits. I'm more with OP on this. I've been reading all these "I love the game" posts today in response to all the negativity about how people play all day every day and I'm just like WTF are you people doing with your time.
---
Respect your MDs child
---
Go on sir i got this under control
---
So why are you crying here exactly?
---
You know what's NOT lame ......Outer Worlds. You don't have to pay 13 a month to play the game solo.
---
There was the same problem. To solve it, you need to completely get rid of the excavation armor and rebuild it from scratch. It helped me

Fallout 76 is¬†an online action role-playing game in the¬†Fallout¬†series developed by¬†Bethesda¬†Game Studios and published by¬†Bethesda¬†Softworks. Released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 14, 2018, it¬†is¬†a prequel to previous series games.

I could go to the pub tonight, or I could get a yearly subscription. 
---
Same price, and FO76 has a lower hangover risk.
---
Go upstairs and ask your parents
---
That's If Bethesda survive that long me and my wife brought a ps4 and extra copy of 76 to play together. We fought through bugs and glitches to get to the end of the main quest line. But then after that we got bored really quickly. Have not played since then I was about to start playing but then the fallout first happens and I have no faith in Bethesda anymore. I am going to boycott this company. I suggest you do the same until they get there shit together or go under.
---
no it isn't the man has bank statements to prove his fucking transaction history my cousins mother in law spent over $5,000 on farmville and various facebook games loaded with micro's. I suggest you take your head out of your ass and do some actual research I have seen addiction to micro's leave people short for bills.
---
I too would like to know this
---
Add bug.  I bought the dang game.     Action. I‚Äôm an idiot.
---
I know my man i've downloaded it yesterday i'll be playing that today fuck bethesda
---
All i'm saying is you could up your bashing bethesda game a notch:(

Fallout 76.¬†Fallout 76 is¬†an online action role-playing game in the¬†Fallout¬†series developed by¬†Bethesda¬†Game Studios and published by¬†Bethesda¬†Softworks. Released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One on November 14, 2018, it¬†is¬†a prequel to previous series games.

Our little exchange we had there could've ended on a high note if you just didn't reply. However, per my last wishes, I respectfully request that you shove your copy of Fallout 76 up your ass horizontally.

I have got respect for brains, not clothes.
---
Good Post
---
Don't need to baby.
---
I did my part and uninstalled the game. Even if I don't plan on subscribing to that bullshit service anyway, I can't in good faith continue supporting a game whose creators are this damn anti-consumer.
---
Why the fuck would you still get it after all this?
---
What is this outer worlds you speak of?
---
Good girl
---
Or just stop whining and pay.
---
So are you going to or not? Do I have to tell mom you're using her credit card again for stupid fucking shit?
---
Theyre all over the place..super cautious guys with buff thumbs üëçüèªü§£

Because (surprise!) they also need money.

If Xbox, look for a post here for my trick or treat times on Halloween.  My actual birthday is Halloween and my kid is a professisonal trick or treater but turned 13 and has to retire.  We're gonna light it up in Appalachia instead.  
---
So far we have 13 lbs of candy, a bunch of bubblegum and gum drops and infinite costumes to give away.  Might have to dip into the legendary stash if too many people show up.
---
...or you could just come back in 6 months to see what‚Äôs different. I‚Äôm sure if you‚Äôre committed to quitting, you could sell the Pip-Boy on eBay or something.
---
Oh look, a condescending twit...
---
The first month nets you some good stuff. The ranger armor and atoms woth more than their dollar amount. So buying it then canceling is IMO worth while. Second month and beyond, not really.
---
I have no problem with subscription services but the price is high if they reduce it it will be a  good PR for them
---
Ugh, people are actually paying for this. Way to fight the good fight. /s
---
Unfortunately PC here but wish you luck!
---
Other factors can make mtx problematic. Like gambling mechanics , price, etc
---
I think what's truly problematic here is the tiered pricing.  Most people can't easily afford dropping $100 at once on this. But most can afford 14.99 a month.  This tiered pricing is yet another tax on the poor or less financially flexible.
---
Nah.
---
Pretty sure they know that better than us dude.
---
The next time people like this make any promises, the news sites, bloggers, youtubers and streamer should just ask them if they are willing to make a contract regarding that statement, holding them accountable and liable this way.
---
Bethesda's fan boys üòÇ.  All 5 of the same leopleu nuthugging over what is honestly one of the worst games ever. You guys are the reason we will continue to get broken ass games from them.
---
I Fallout Second that notion
---
In almost any multiplayer game I have played I have been able to make or host private servers without paying, dealing with the buggy mess that FO76 is and hating a company all at the same time so, so much in my life. Not like I'm going to waste my money and time trying though for this cancer. Anyone that still supports this horribly disgusting companies sickens me, so many fools complaining about the game and then they start throwing money at the screen like it'll fix itself.
---
Lmao you must be a raider....
---
I didnt contribute to Bernie Sanders Campaign.
---
Hope isn‚Äôt necessary. Just time.
---
&gt;I didn't even buy a game, because I'm super cautious about any new game, but some people did buy it and I feel for them. But now, when people know what is what (because Bethesda made sure to let you know over the past year with series of failures - including initial launch) and they still buy into that shit - YOU ARE DUMB!
---
I don't quite get, man. It's a great game. I've had over 300 hours of fun in it, and I'm sure I'll get many more. It's one of the more enjoyable video game experiences I've had in the past few years, and got more that my money's worth of entertainment out of it. 
---
I'd say it was more dumb to form an opinion of a game based on a negative hype, but fair enough -- I'll just be over here with friends exploring the wastelands while you post an angry rant about a game you've never even played.
---
Well, everything is still free, and you are free to choose if you want to pay for it or not ;D
---
That's probably because school starts around this time, so all the kids are there.
---
I understand that high numbers means high rarity, but I'm not sure you see what I mean: Say the previous numbers were like this for five item categories: 1, 25, 50, 75, 99. Lower number is lower rarity, and you always get 16 items each hour. Then you get a lot of 1's, a few of 25, almost no 99's. But if they change the numbers to even out more, this gives a higher chance for higher rarity, e.g. 45, 55, 65, 75, 85. The gap between common and rare is now closer. Although I agree with your statement *if* there was a chance for the bot not to find any items.
---
I had been taking a break and was going to come back soon from playing destiny 2 on pc  when I heard this absolutely moronic decision, and I immediately went to uninstall the game. This game does not deserve the player base that stuck by it through all the bad times, me included since the beta. It sucks, because I absolutely adore the Fallout franchise. Never again. Bethesda has burnt me for the last time.
---
But the the outrage youtubers don't and it doesn't matter for them how much the game improve they won't stop until Bethesda shutdown the servers
---
Uninstalled. Thinks haven‚Äôt got better just worse morally and In the game.
---
I‚Äôm sorry my dollars helped pay for your Wastelanders ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Uninstalled yesterday. No point keeping this trash in storage.
---
Color me surprised, another "new" feature in fallout76 released broken at launch? Who would've fucking thought heh, apart from everyone sane?
---
If you actually pay a 100$ for this shit, then I'm sorry to say that you're the problem with gaming today. You deserve the shit you buy.
---
Someone's salty he can't afford a videogame sub. :(
---
My cousin thinks that Fallout 1st was the plan from day one - and they released it because it has already been developed for months, and they thought ‚Äúwhy not‚Äù. I think FO76 was always supposed to be a monthly earner for Bethesda, after they‚Äôve seen the success of Apex and Fortnite etc.
---
At this point they should just hurry up with Wastelanders and try and move up from 76. I wanna say it can‚Äôt get worse but Bethesda are wizards and find a way to make it worse every time
---
Thanks I will record me uninstaling them on both my and my wife's ps4 and then throwing them in the rubbish bin.
---
Its october 25 my man nope
---
In the span of a year, Bethesda has gone from one of the most respected companies in gaming to one of the most despised. They should be ashamed of everything that's gone on with this game, and now they top it off by charging MORE MONEY for a subscription service? Screw you Bethesda. You're as low as EA in my eyes now, and that is a bad place to be. I'm going to skip DOOM Eternal even though I want to play it. A message needs to be sent that this is not an okay way to treat your customers.
---
well its valves decision not to bid for exclusives.
---
That doesn't make it any less of a competition, it would not be a competition if even when offered a higher amount of money the devs would be unable to take it.
---
Because what you are saying is that any exclusivity is monopoly and not competition.
---
But that makes it so both xbox and playstation are monopolies and wait that doesn't work
---
They will never stop, those people are just professionally trained drama milkers, who also need money, and do it their own way. Wonders of democracy.
---
I'm playing Outer Worlds. It's free on Xbox Game Pass. Pretty good so far, but I'm disappointed that nobody comments about the fact I'm in nothing but my spacepants. I'll be back for Halloween stuff.
---
No-one is in these familiar worlds, they‚Äôre all in those **outer worlds**
---
Vacations start tomorrow actually.
---
Dyou think that‚Äôs why people are unhappy? Just because they can‚Äôt afford it?
---
Yeah, and you must be Mama Murphy. Go choke on some Jet, you delusional old bag of bones
---
Being happy with shit isn't exactly a win. Just means your standards are incredibly low.
---
This game is like a self opening pinata - it's a gift lol
---
Listen buddy. I payed for this subscription because I want Todd to buy Obsidian from Microsoft so they could re release Outer Worlds for Nintendo Switch. I need to play something while I poop.
---
Really? In aus they ended like two weeks ago my man assuming its the same with uni breaks. Everythings upside down i guess huh
---
They have a different studio working on Fallout 76 and i have not many worries about starfield because it's a new IP i am sure they will do their best with it
---
Well that's my standards and I do what I want with them. At least I am not dictating what others standards should be like you do.
---
Rad shield does not suppress either. Good for the nuke zones. Damn T51 lets in 4 rads so i always make a couple just in case some one drops on WS.
---
haha
---
Modding was the last thing this game had going for it. Modding was the o ly way this game could have been fixed, and they put it behind a paywall. I swear, it's like they WANT this game to fail.
---
They have a chance to spawn in that location but you can find bobbleheads and magazines in a variety of places. I didn't know there was a guide book too.
---
I have tons of legacy guns that make the game kinda fun and I liked hunting legendary stuff and trading was cool for a while. I honestly don‚Äôt think the game was that bad. But I uninstalled because it just seems like the game is sliding into a kind of mediocre money grab, I‚Äôd 100% buy the ranger armor for the price of first if it would leave me feeling so dirty. And add to that there‚Äôs a free mod in fallout 4 that looks insanely better? Not to mention your world isn‚Äôt persistent it‚Äôs just an empty lobby, so it takes  away what I think was the best added part too the game player vending machines, I would have happily kept paying for skins and playing if it felt right
---
Bullseye!
---
Someone is triggered...
---
Jw where is this 1/3 of a server coming from? I feel like I must have missed something about the servers
---
I love it when lads just add space to something. Spacepants. Heh.
---
They also said there wouldnt be anything for pay to win as well MULTIPLE TIMES. And now there's plenty. They even showed the scrap bot was originally suppose to be in the game before launch now its 5 bucks. They just want ur money not giving a flying F what they put out  They are taking you guys for fools. I was once one myself until they added pay to win elements. Finally I couldnt deal with Bethesda's lies and deception. And if u honestly dont think there are lay to win elements your severely delusional and I mean that in the most genuine and not insulting way.
---
If u continue to pay for this stuff they will never fix their ways and continue count money and stick out unfinished and glitchy games.
---
You are part of the problem child. What is going through your silly little head when you decide to pay $100 for this scam? I would really like to know
---
Its around midnight rn in the states.
---
Oh boy do you think we'll continue tomorrow too? One can only hope!
---
What? When did I say that? I literally just bought The outer worlds. I‚Äôm talking about supporting this horrible business practice. If you support Fallout 1st it‚Äôs going to show Bethesda that we as a community want this kind of stuff.
---
Because it‚Äôll be an added feature into Fallout 1st soon - display items take up no budget. Mark my words
---
Good for you. From my perspective you are supporting a shady game dev who released a unfinished product filled with bugs and technical issues and tried to monetize the shit out of it by retracting on their previous promises of "cosmetics only" microtransactions, oh btw the microtransactions they did implement are garbage "pay to avoid the inconvenience we built into the game to frustrate you into paying for this solution we could have built into the game to begin with".
---
Honestly if we had less people like this and more people willing to stand by at least some sort of principles when it comes to what quality we expect from a full price 60 dollar game we'd all be better off but as long as people like this exist companies like Bethesda will try to exploit you.
---
Dude I‚Äôve been waiting for Elder scrolls 6 for 8 years. It was always going to be a long wait
---
Wait.wait.wait. you only spend a $100 at the pub?
---
The person who remains on the server HAS to be a paying Fallout 1st member.  That caveat is overlooked.
---
Up until today I did it because I could have a game to play with my SO.  I like Fallout, she likes Fallout, it makes sense.  But it just stopped being fun when I feel like someone is trying to take advantage of me.  It feels wrong, so it‚Äôs wrong for me.
---
People want a functioning game that doesn't shove monetisation down thier throats = entitled. OK then
---
I know theres different branches to Bethesda and its unfair to the side companies that suffer because of the idiots who are calling the shots with 76, even other games from them like the newest wolfensteins and rage 2. I‚Äôm sure future title like doom will be fine....hopefully
---
How are they greedy and scamming people?  Base game was 60 bucks.  1st is a cheap premium service.  You dont have to purchase 1st.  Its good they delayed wastelanders so its not be as buggy like it was in the beginning.  Dlcs, servers, addons are not cheap.  They have a staff they have to pay.  Go play minecraft or something if you dont like how 76 is being ran.
---
I'll be here ;)
---
Private servers were announced before the game even launched and you're a daft moron if you think they weren't going to cost money, considering no game on the market offers private servers for free.
---
No sympathy here.
---
For my style of gameplay it is forced. I'd rather not go into details. You can check my reddit account and find it if you wish.
---
But I do want this kind of stuff, what you gonna do about it?
---
I‚Äôve played it to death but only bought one pack of atoms for like $10. The cosmetic stuff isn‚Äôt enough for me, and the build limitations mean I can‚Äôt make a densely-decorated CAMP. I‚Äôm a trophy hunter, so I got to level 100, platinum‚Äôd it and I haven‚Äôt been back for a week now. I‚Äôm fed up with the same thing every time I play. I can‚Äôt use the legendary vendor because it crashes. I can‚Äôt display things in my CAMP because they take up so much budget (I bet that will be a perk of Fallout 1st eventually) 
---
Just fed up. I‚Äôm trying to play a single player game in a multiplayer environment. Fallout 4  and TOW achieve this,
---
So I‚Äôll spend my time and money on those from now on
---
And yet people still think private servers will be mod supported...
---
This right here.
---
The major problem with mods not being possible the way the community wants them to is simply the fact that Private Worlds and adventure are connected.
---
Mods won't have any kind of control over your world, so we can collectively forget about high level enemies across the map and endless warfare-level of spawns, which are literally the least one would expect from a modded private world.
---
Otherwise if they allow modding at full capacity and don't separate private worlds from Adventure premium users will basically be legal cheaters, being allowed to modify spawns and drops, scrip and caps limit, perhaps even a console-like holotape like the Cheat Terminal from 4...
---
Imagine logging onto your "private" server and seeing 3 red circles around the glassed cavern!
---
I never used mods in FO4 and only built basic structures to gain population.  In 76 it is different; as it is your unique camp.  I still don't build much; but I would think the options are at least on par with FO4; it's just a little different.  
---
They just reduced the weight of mags and bobbles, and you can build displays for them.  Almost everything in the game can be displayed.
---
Making up content would mean that I'm just aimlessly wandering around.  There is a finite number of outfits, plans, variants of baseball bats, etc.  Challenging yourself to get them all is built in to the game; but I get your point.
---
Nothing obviously, but I am seriously curious what you think are positives from this.
---
I just hope you have enough IQ to be able to tell that supporting these kinds of garbage only makes it so the game dies sooner rather than later.
---
I know i am just suggesting this to help to stop youtubers from making videos on the game i am waiting for the wastelander dlc before I play it because the future of the game is relying heavily on that dlc and i have not a lot of worries for starfield because it's a new IP and i am sure they will do their best
---
What does that even mean????
---
Anyone got an archive of the post? Wanna know why it was deleted etc
---
BECAUSE WE AT BETHESDA LOVE MONEY SO MUCH GET TO YOUR THICK SKULL. PAY US 13 DOLLARS PER MONTH OR I DON'T KNOW 90 SOMETHING EACH YEAR . IF YOU PAY US AGAIN YOU CAN PLAY SOLO OR WITH GROUP WITH FRIENDS. I AM TODD BUY SKYRIM ON YOUR SMART WATCH!
---
No, it's not a nerf, OP and 300 upvoters does not know how logic works. Rarity levels have been evened out, not "raised".
---
Smoke another bowl with your beta buds darling
---
You're a real unicorn, that's for sure
---
I guess its a "no" then. Clever girl
---
Well we got 1650 Atoms, Ranger outfit and the tent. Ain't that nice?
---
If you subscribe to this scam, you're part of the problem. That's all there is to it, you deserve losing your stuff honestly, maybe that'll make you learn to not support obvious garbage.
---
If you want a poop game fallout is a solid choice.
---
BYE CAN O HAVE YOUR GUNAS BYYYEEEEEAR YOULL BE BACK
---
[F076 Filthy Casuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) has your back, friendo.
---
Personally I think its important to have youtubers talking about these unmoral practices, I get the community aware and hopefully Bethesda hears how angry the major population of the community is, and hopefully works on fixing (again) their mistake
---
You played it for basically a full year?  I think they did ok with that
---
For $100 though? you can‚Äôt seriously think that‚Äôs worth it.
---
I have like 16 of each scrap as I just moved base again
---
I'm crying? I came to laugh at people
---
Have fun in Outer Worlds. Be sure to do the quest "Protect Uranus" early on.

Don‚Äôt feed the trolls

horrible that so many felt the need to suppress and diminish peoples complaints, though.
---
Great game üòÇ
---
You‚Äôre grasping at straws now.
---
Yes it's important but not when they work hard on milking the problem to get clicks
---
I asume it would have to be something like textures, radios, quests and alike.
---
The only way we could get armors would be as outfits by the community placed in the atom shop. 
---
For new weapons the only solution would be for it to be just implemented I the base game even if its made by community ir for them to stay on the private servers only, where if you go to public it just doesnt appear on your inv ir simply a text that lets you know its there and the weight but doesnt let you equip it
---
I'm sure he's going to stop having fun to appeal to your sense of gaming superiority.
---
Ya thats when it gets even more out of hand i can agree on that
---
Keep guessing
---
If it was actually a server, that might be the basis of a defensible argument.
---
Actually, from their own traceroute, it looks like they're hosted on AWS.
---
Why?
---
My money, my business.
---
[That's how](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFcLyDb6niA)
---
Free on x box?? Ah mannnnnn no fair
---
They already gave out credit card info over a bag
---
Atleast he knows he'll get fucked by the devs
---
Hahahahahahahhahahahahahha
---
While that is true, and I respect that.  We vote with our wallets.
---
Why are you defending this? It's funny and rightfully deserved.
---
"It just works."
---
RIP Bethesda.
---
You just told me you aren't smart enough to tell p2w garbage only makes it so people don't play the game, and its not like many people did before this.
---
Let alone all the bugs that still exist in the game.
---
Wtf? The comment I responded to was an insult against Control. 
---
Did you edit your comment or is the Reddit app fuck-y?
---
I said made the company, you said founded the company. Those are two different things mate.
---
MW just released a few hours ago also
---
Anyway you should submit a ticket becouse you could be one of those people that isnt just a visual bug
---
I thought I would enjoy for at least one night. I was wrong.

---
Funny,
---
when I thought to myself "This is just the beginning" was when they offered 500 atoms as compensation, which cost's them NOTHING because there is no overhead. They could have easily done 2k. They looked at it the atoms as money they COULD be making which is purely speculation but that is why they gave out so little. Anything more was seen as potential money lost. 
---
It's kind like the piracy argument. You don't really know if all those people who pirated would have actually bought the game if they couldn't get free access to it.
---
Take it out regardless untill its fixed for sure
---
For some people it would be, cost $180 in Australia, but that's still less than 50 cents a day.
---
I dont care what people say on the internet, i base my opinion on personal experience.  Play the game and form one yourself.  You wouldnt be disappointed.
---
What you see on Reddit is only a minority. Despite what you want to believe. I have seen a ton of people with scrap storage and ranger outfits. So I would say you are getting ahead of yourself by saying it‚Äôs ‚Äúsoon to be failing‚Äù. 
---
‚ÄúI hate this subscription model and no one else in entitled to a difference of opinion‚Äù would be the correct translation of your comment.
---
I mean, they've been enable by the people endlessly defending them. The community has nobody to blame but themselves.
---
The information was public on this subreddit from a few minutes after maintenance ended Tuesday
---
Finally someone reasonable.
---
No, old link works just fine..?
---
If they are fanboys, they wouldn't want Bethesda to die. They would defend Bethesda, the game and this idiotic monetization scheme to their last breath.
---
Also: with all this talk of servers of late, I just remembered that while dealing with Beth CS, I reverse searched some of the IPs involved, and I found they were using AWS.
---
If they're using AWS, is there any way they could even possibly have offered "dedicated" servers?  Seems like they actually did offer something that wasn't even possible, and that's demonstrably false advertising.
---
People complained about repair kits being on the shop and you can get the better version of them for free in the game.
---
You're delusional if you think people wouldnt complain and bitch about your idea too.
---
Make the subscription mandatory.
---
hahAHAHAHAHAhaha ..ha.. haha.. HAHHAHAHA! My stomach hurts from laughing so hard. 
---
*Goes back to The Outer Worlds*
---
Agreed.
---
Y E S
---
They did FO3, FO4 and 76. FO:NV was done by another developer.
---
Is this only true for PC? Or was modding also announced for consoles?
---
A man once said "Fool me once... shame on...? shame on you. Fool me can't get fooled again."
---
Thats how i like it though, personal preference i guess.  I usually dont play multiplayer games but 76 is one.  The less people playing the better for me.  You dont like the aspects of the game fine, dont play the game or dont pay for 1st.  Me is plenty smartz
---
They could make Wastelanders DLC for 19.99$ only!
---
Not piss of the hate crew enough so they stay around &amp; annoy the people who are happy to play.
---
That would suck, I'd so keep playing
---
I dont want to be part of this lovers quarrel that is going on here but a word of advise for you good sir. I would not tell an obvious troll that your asshole is gapped wide enough to fit a human. Just not a good look that's all I am saying. That's some mister slave shit, way past just gerbils at that point. I am not judging but what a man does with an entire car tire should probably be kept private and not on a forum about a video game.
---
It's hard to take people who have hope in slippery toad seriously.
---
Im sure next year Bethesda is going to keep dev'ing shit just for you.
---
No, $19.99 per month
---
Will do after work.
---
 I don't even know you but I know that you are a fucking dumbass.
---
I have a nukacola bar and a detectives office next to anchor farm with the plane. Im very proud if it, if on xbox my gt is DARKDANI and we could see each others camp.
---
ok ty but still not one example how this can screw up someone else game experience. i mean 1st dont do 10% more damage or something like that what would fit in your category.
---
having games made less enjoyable? so this is pure emotion? the game is less enjoyable for you because there are 2-3 things you could have, if you buy it, but you dont want, because its for money? i still dont get it.
---
i mean whatever you did before in this game you still can? but im not asking for examples anymore as you guys truly cant tell me one \^\^
---
Wastelanders is gonna cost money.
---
I havent edited my comments. The first OP was talking about Control, then a guy mentioned Dark Souls and Bloodborne and at the end of your reply to him you said "Lordy what has Live Service done to you kids?"
---
except as someone said somewhere in this thread, they have always been like this just not as bad......remember horse armor. They were literally one of the first companies to do "micro transactions" in a "AAA" game.
---
I've always been an avid radio listener in 3/NV/4, with modded radio playlists of 100+ songs. The best of those was for NV, where a user mod added all the songs to the radio that had titles or lyrics which provided all the quest names.
---
In 76, I listened to the radio for an hour or two, then switched it off. And I've never looked back. The OST is so good, IMO, that I actively switch off radios I find in the open world and get annoyed at the stupid vendor machine jingles, jukeboxes or radios playing in other people's CAMPs and drowning out the soundtrack.
---
I got a cheaty friend. Does fun stuff. Not bringing in weapons. Or weird fo4 shit with dll injector. Ya know. It's a fucking problem for thousands of players. So if one takes a drit nap and loses thier bank info. Im not too worried.
---
ya, i dont think were talking about the same company.  Bethesda doesn't give a shit about it's fans.
---
The real basement dwellers are u fols that pa√≠s 60$ for the Game, spent like 20$ a month in atoms and now a subscription lol u have to be really fuckng sad if you sink in 150$+ in a destroyed game and still defend It xd u guys seriously amaze me with your stupidity
---
Yeah, since OP seemed to imply that people should STILL be playing Control which makes no sense seeing as it‚Äôs not a Hamster Wheel game
---
Yeah, but people dont get that and just rant about it.
---
Players should have the option to run the game on their own servers. They should not have to go through Bethesda and pay the middleman premium
---
Bold of you to assume I only get my information from Reddit and that only people on Reddit are complaining about it.
---
&gt; Other games that have servers that do not cost a subscription besides the purchase price
---
Just like FO76.
---
You only have to pay for *private* servers.   Thre public ones are still free.
---
If and when 76 dies, fine.  I have gotten plenty of play time with it, only game ive played since last november.  Ill move on just like everyone else when the time comes.  You know what i really want?  A new fucking Command &amp; Conquer, thatd be amazeballs.
---
Lets stop blaming others for the fuck ups of the devs. I hate when the same shit happens with Blizzard and people Blame activision.
---
This is not Zenimax. This is Bethesda. They are the ones lying. They are the ones who released a shit game. They are the ones who are asking for more and more money.
---
Its excuses like these that allow these companies to do this shit an retain their reputation, because its "Not their fault". Yes, it is their fault.
---
The bastards
---
"Fallout 1st...... It just works".
---
Did BGS say anything about your junk yet?
---
To be brutally honest here, you deserve all this ‚Äúbullshit‚Äù and then some, for contributing your money to a scam and allowing Bethesda to continue existing and finding more ways to defraud people of their money. So in a way, you are actually part of the scam. Not only you obviously, all the kids who gave money to these scammers.
---
But the guy you said that to wasnt the OP OP..and also never brought up Control.
---
&gt; as well as a robot that annoys the crap out of you by constantly repeating the same canned lines.
---
;p
---
Does not matter whether its Bethesda or the parent company, fact is their word is trash, their promises are worthless, and you can't trust anything they say. They have proven that no matter what is said, the person in charge is prepared to fuck the consumer over whenever it pleases them.
---
They have taken two decades of their reputation, stuffed it in a paper bag with dog shit and set it on fire on your front door. And all because the people ultimately in charge, want to make some extra bucks.
---
The only justice will be to see this backfire as the value of their company nose dives as the market realizes that they have screwed their brand beyond saving.
---
At this point all i'm getting is that you enjoy getting screwed over. Whatever, I don't care enough to argue it further.
---
"Made" means created. No they aren't different things, mate.
---
Google is your friend kind sir! Outer Worlds is being described as the perfect remedy to a fo76 fan's broken heart.
---
They're probably gonna do something like pete Hines or Todd Howard saying some half assed apologies and then release wastelanders in whatever state they have it in to make up for it,then put out 4 or 5 patches that simultaneously fix and break the features of the fallout 1st shit then they release 1 patch that breaks wastelanders even further from what it may or may not have been.

What are you on about? Many of us only bought the base game and that was it
---
I for one, wanna see this game doing good. But this isn't the way. Far from it.
---
So you're just a destructive piece of shit
---
No, \*I\* did ok on that. I did buy some atoms, but they don't get my subscription.
---
Interesting, on my screen, I AM responding to him (I use the Reddit app) 
---
I think this may be the app being fuck-y 
---
You‚Äôre not the first person to point out that I‚Äôve had weird responses to comments
---
You know this because...?
---
That newly created world probably had people in their friends list pop in and sneak raid areas.
---
All Bethesda would have to do is allow a friend to control our follower via online or splitscreen co-op.
---
Sadly.
---
Insane that you're getting downvoted. Preordering *is* genuinely fucking stupid, and if they waited any time at all before buying this game they'd have seen how shit it was. The saga of FO76 turning from shit into dogshit has been incredible, but not as incredible as the people who were still playing at this point or even who bought the service. 
---
A fool and his money.
---
See though in these companies eyes that isn't lying, they don't have a season pass and all of content has "technically" been free. It's just they make it unberable and almost impossible to obtain everything you want, and the sub fee they would say is neither of the two "it's utility". This company makes me sick, i'd literally rather buy an EA game at this point. Fuck bethesda and zenimax.
---
I hope so. In this day and age there is NO reason to pre-order, ESPECIALLY digitally!! It's not like they are going to sell out of copies.
---
I wait for a games release. 24 hours is usually my wait time.
---
I remember waking up early for No Mans Sky launch and literately hitting refresh on Steam and watching the score plummet over two hours from launch. SO glad I did NOT buy the game because that was my plan. Wake up early, watch a quick live stream, see how the first impressions are and break my 24hr rule.
---
I won't even pre-order Death Stranding, but this will be another 24hr rule breaker I think....
---
You will be back
---
You're an absolute gullible dumbass and you deserve your shit getting lost for spending that money in the first place. Fuck me dead i actually cannot believe someone will literally spend the same amount of money a month that will get you something equivalent to an xbox game pass that lets you access 100s of games, yet you choose to pour more money into this shit game? You've brought it upon yourself. Consider this a major turning point in your life
---
Ahh gotchya, fuckin reddit.
---
Lol if I said anything rude/nasty, Ii was under the ASSUMPTION I was taking to OP. 
---
Sorry about that üòÇ
---
You're not mad at all about the subscription? They upfront charged us, then they microtransactioned us and now there's a subscription?
---
They're like a patreon and crowd-funding run short of a grand slam of monetisation.
---
why it's not any better. I have like 3k hours in that game , but the moneitzation in that game is literally in my opinion the only reason why fallout 76 exists in the form it does and why their "fallout 1st" membership is so similar to eso's. Don't fool yourself thinking zos is any better they are literally one in the same.
---
Its doing just fine for me dude.  Im on PC and havent seen a lot of the bugs people have complained about.  Only thing ive seen is the disconnects that are actually pretty rare for me.  Probably because i have an awesome setup with badass internet.  Seems like more people on console are having more of the problems.
---
Slippery toad...
---
You realize slippery slope is a logical fallacy, right?
---
Oh god, subscription based Elder Scrolls 6, thats a terrifying thought.
---
You‚Äôre welcome for the free DLC in year 2.
---
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY DEFENDING THEM????
---
if you would have told me before f76 that Bethesda would do anything like this i would of laughed my ass off and told you it something EA wouldn't even do. yet here we are and i honestly dont think bethesda have the bankroll to take the PR hits like EA dose. seriously starting to worry for the companys direction as a whole.

---
Yeah, I don't know why people deal with this. Games are meant to be FUN!!! My dad (for some reason) bought Fallout 76 and he linked my Xbox with his account so I can play his games, so I have been able to download it for free whenever I wanted. But that's the thing. I don't want to. I'd rather play a game for actual FUN. Even Fallout 4 was fun to me though I agree it's far worse than basically any other Fallout game that came before it. But dang, people need to stop supporting projects they "hope" will get better, and support the ones that are ALREADY good enough!
---
its just a matter off time lol
---
They will never allow us to host our own serverd and they will introduce mods via another paywall.
---
160 items i believe before they respawn
---
You 1st.
---
There'll be two nukes going off in that bathroom.
---
I don‚Äôt own the game, nor would I play it again if it was given to me.
---
I left after the first week :D
---
I'm only here to see how the community is reacting to the patch notes that discord had on their home screen. Such a disappointing game. Fingers x'd that when the outer worlds downloads I'll forget about this.
---
im not worried either. lol
---
Look man,
---
Some folks really do believe the Earth is flat. There is no arguing with folks like that. All you are going to do is just get angry and lose faith in humanity. 
---
Sometimes you just need to break the wrist and walk away.
---
Break the wrist, walk away.
---
GTAO does have a way to enter a private server for just you and your friends. It‚Äôs a bit weird to get to, but works rather well.
---
Uninstalled the game and bethesda launcher yesterday. enough is enough!
---
We need a civil discussion between both sides and the devs.
---
I love your appreciation and respect for art like great games, but doesn't that make you feel insulted and lied to? Todd LITERALLY made so many claims that he probably never meant to keep, and just meant to slow backlash down until the release of stupid sh\*t like the subscription service. 
---
Fallout 76 is objectively bad but there's no problem if you enjoy playing a bad game. But if you don't even enjoy it, are you really okay with playing a GAME that DEPRESSES you?? Like just think about that for a moment. A game, that you PAY FOR, and spend time on to ENJOY, is DEPRESSING you, and you still play? Friend, maybe you should just play other games or find other things to do than games because I have no problem with someone enjoying this trash game but it's probably unhealthy to not enjoy it and keep doing it in the hopes you'll enjoy it. If you haven't after so long, trying even more won't help, friend. You deserve to feel good, and games SHOULD make you feel good. You feel me?
---
Yes and no. Everyone deserves basic respect and dignity. No one deserves death threats or other kinds of abuse. Community managers aren't at fault at all of this. Targeting them with outrage isn't going to help. Petition for answers from those who are hired by companies to be the ones getting in contact with customers is only logical.
---
 Yes, voting with wallets helps the most. But we as customers can also apply pressure on the specified communication channels.
---
The site was for a time down, propably due to huge traffic.
---
Everyone: What the hell is Fallout 1st?!
---
Bethesda: Bravo six going dark
---
Seriously what the fuck is happening here, why did you lie? The game was looking very promising until this lol
---
They used Creation because that way they could cut development costs for their newer games.
---
Want to bet Starfield and ES6 have at the very least a Local multiplayer option?
---
That's good. That's exactly where they want you. Keep your shit safe. Only porn and vida. Paranoid maybe. Safe always. :)
---
That's not going to happen on this sub right now. There isn't any civility at the moment. Just hate at each other.
---
they didn't have much of a choice at the time though, it took them like 7 years to build that game. When they started building that game pc hardware was nowhere near what it is today. ESO has a lot of cool tech in it to get a lot of players on screen, the problem is their servers are complete ass either that or their netcode. And the creation engine is actually based off of what was orignally designed as an MMO engine anyways. Bethesda's engine isn't bad, the people who have put different tools and stuff into the enigne and wrote the code for it are at fault mostly, and Bethesda not dedicating time to upkeep their engine besdies minor graphical improvements over the years. When

Probably to let millennial betas continue to play and bitch about having to pay a subscription to get extra shit?
---
So.... do you just have one character ? I don't get why it's such an issue for people unless you're the level 500 folks that just launch nukes and kill thru Westek and server hop and repeat, gets boring imo, but neat you have all those legendaries lol
---
Not sorry, you really deserve this for paying for nothing and support them in their l√≠es and shitty practices
---
O shit
---
Then if you have no intentions to touch it again, I fail to see the reasoning behind still being here, besides to rake in that sweet karma for jumping on the hate train.
---
Clearly you don't know any business terms....
---
Youre not that old
---
This is literally karma for paying scammers and being part of the scam. Every person who actually paid for this thing deserves every single issue they experience. Maybe someday you morons will eventually learn not to give scammers any money for the benefit of the entire gaming community.
---
By looking at some of your other posts on reddit, I don't think your someone we should be listening to.
---
Something about all white people or some crap
---
Really dude, it's just a game, get over it
---
Isn't that a bit like finding a million dollars but you're still the only living human left on the planet?
---
You know, deep down you want the story to succeed.
---
NV was Obsidian.  And yeah, that's exactly what I meant--FO3 was good, but Bethesda acquired an already vibrant universe and made progressively worse and worse games in it.  Their name is now synonymous with Fallout and Elder Scrolls only because most people seem not to know the extent to which they're actually involved in FO...
---
My buddy says the percentage goes down the more sets you know &amp; if you have any extra plans in your stash or on your character you won't learn any new ones. Hope that helpsü§ôüèª
---
Got shoa'd huh?
---
Hmmm no its not just console. Shotguns for example have been broken since forever, the power armor you get from farming the raid has been crashing people and everyone around them since it came out. Mobs still sometime fully heal out of the blue. Etc.
---
I wasn't talking about the bugs, but selling a membership when the game is still arguably in a stale/broken/unfinished state, and on top of that gating more P2W (scrapbox) behind it.
---
Oh god, I forgot about that cringe ass shit show!
---
Because I legitimately care about Bethesda and what they will become if the community supports this bad business practice.
---
I'd like for this site to continue, just to satirise future things that come up with Fallout 76. I can't possibly imagine that this is the last of it.
---
Wouldn't mind seeing a post satirising Bethesda's blatant money-grab. I mean we're already got 3 different monetisation schemes for this game - upfront cost, microtransactions and now a subscription. I would not at all be surprised to see a patreon for new content as well as crowd-funding for the DLC after Wastelanders (if the game ever survives the Wastelanders launch).
---
Oh come on--when it doesn't crash, it's great!
---
...but, eh, yeah...it does crash a lot.
---
What a massive overreaction.
---
Not everyone hs disposable income.
---
Wayy back Pete Haynes said in an interview that all content is going to be free. Now they're drowning in their own lies...
---
thank you for that troll you loser..
---
we already got a official statement that its NOT just a visual bug.
---
you so depressed in reallife that you have to do shit like this?
---
Thank you, that‚Äôs helpful
---
Yet. They've been looking at an IPO which is part of the reason we're seeing them do every scummy thing to make their numbers look good.
---
Haha all good man. Shit, been bouncing between RDR2, and the Star Wars MMO on PC..waiting to check out Death Stranding in 2 weeks or so. How about you? Halo fan I assume? I grew up on Halo 1, still probably my favorite game of all time.
---
These big "triple A" companies no longer make games but rather grinding systems around a bunch of slot machines and paywalls that masquerade as a "game". There are still a few devs who truely care...but the chinese overlords that are slowly infecting everything with corporate greed without actually caring or listening to their fans. They are destroying beloved franchises just for the sake of short term profits. Look at the movie industry as well..just crumbling and breaking down. Gaming as a whole is suffering another big fallout ( hehe see what i did there? ) but hopefully other companies like cd project red or even digital extremes can set the example on how to do things right and actually make games that they themselves would want to play instead of bowing down to investors that only see us clients as moneybags ready to milk out every cent out of us.
---
I actually noticed this last night. I run full Vanguard/Sentinel with IronClad, Evasive, Dodgy and an Armored Backpack and even Mole Rats and Miners were doing significant damage. I have 600+ ballistic and energy resistance and still taking way more damage than usual. 
---
Has anyone else noticed this?
---
Something is definitely wrong. Its the armor to as the perks were working, AP diminished on being hit, the resistance perks boosted my dr etc...
---
I mean, Bethesda never changed. You just accepted it before. 
---
JFC you guys deserved this. "WHY DOES THE STOVE BURN ME!?"

Totally overreacting.

Strangely, I had expected something stupid like that, and copied the download to another file.  So I just aborted the download, copied it back the download directory, tried to launch again, and it skipped a full re-download.
---
But yeah, that should never have happened.
---
Nor should the "BETA" have been a mere two days.  (mighta been three on console)
---
you know..I just grabbed the complaints from like 3 or 4 different post and just wanted to farm karma....
---
we already got a official statement that it is NOT just a visual bug.
---
ty for exposing yourself as a massive troll. screenshots are made for future troll tries from you.
---
So you're okay with fans of this game ripping each apart over something so stupid? This is beyond fucking dumb
---
Hopefully sooner than later.  The community is experiencing hype cabin fever by making top Elden boss and music lists without there even being a game yet.
---
Vaati's new art competition is great though. :D
---
No, don't read I you can't stand it. I like reading opposite opinions - those who moan how they've lost their junk and those make laugh out of them. It's entertaining...

there is already a official statement that is NOT just a visual bug. ty for exposing yourself as a massive troll.

Your analogy works the same as a metaphor.

OK. See you back in two weeks

Get used to it.

No and no. I won't be using the scrapbox again until this is fixed though.

Its the second link.
---
Well there ya go
---
its not just a visual bug. we got a official statement saying this now. fuck these trolls.
---
I feel you. I was waiting for the game to get better, instead they did this.
---
Promoting employee attrition is a valid tactic.
---
I'm sort of glad they put us out of our misery they kept dragging us along behind a horse that was slowly dying and now it's dead i can get up and move on to other games.
---
And i agree totally Bethesda fucked up bit least we got fallout 3, new Vegas and fallout 4 but won't be buying anything Bethesda related for a long time.
---
That‚Äôs like 16 lols
---
Come on bruh. Why do you think that they delayed to Q1 2020?
---
I would not at all be surprised in the slightest if they still haven't locked down the story for the main quest of this DLC.
---
Dude,
---
Don't think for one second that this wont happen. Even if the new DLC drops and it's semi good, this will happen. Even Stevie Wonder can see this shit coming.
---
Players need to flee far from this because if they don't, this will happen. If atoms aint paying the bills but this new paywall does, quality of life items will be behind this shit too.
---
This is F2P shit.
---
Not gonna lie, scrapbox is pretty fucking cool, havent lost any junk.  I dont use my private server, plus i play solo.  I dont use PA(vanguard all the way), dont do the raids. My instigating explosive primed double barrel shotgun fucking slays.  It sucks people are having a hard time but i cant jump on the fuck bethesda bandwagon when i havent had the same problems as others you know?
---
good riddance
---
the cancer weeds itself
---
I'm not talking about that.
---
Yep. My bet is that they would just do a more controlled version of the creation club. Maybe blending the atomic shop with MTX mods on top of the paywall and a f2p model? They're now giving an allowance of atoms per month which can be used on the mods. Creators will get some sort of cut in either in $ or atoms. Maple Story 2 NA does something similar.
---
At this point I wouldn't be surprised.
---
Its the second link but the coats a little darker.

What a fantastic idea, stifling criticisms always works /s
---
sorry to break illusion you've been living üòÇ
---
I'd rather drop another thousand on Star Citizen than give bethesda a single cent.
---
I know, sadly.
---
Why would you even purchase this lol
---
they fail to realize that the "Death" of BGS would mean Fallout and Elder scrolls would either never have another game in their series.
---
Or worse, be bought by companies like EA, Activision, or Ubisoft...
---
then they can see something f*ar, far* worse than Fallout 76
---
I watched the whole thing when it dropped.  I didn't get that this wasn't a game made in Bethesda, MD.
---
Eh, I've yet to see any gaming related death threats carried out. Bunch of fucking pansies is what they are.
---
You sound like Bethesda employee, I swear to god üòÇ
---
Probably the whole lying to everyone, and having a broken game that you have to fork out even more to make more bearable?
---
You're a complete fucking idiot, I read some of your other posts after Aussie said something and... Well he's right.
---
People like you really get on my nerves, acting like you're helping "the cause", when in reality you can't even fathom what's really going on. You are a SHEEP with little or zero knowledge on what you are trying to be a part of.
---
Sweet! Come say hi!
---
\^ THIS.  This is what the doc says.
---
Can I buy another 5 copies of Skyrim first?
---
They owe us nothing.
---
Just open them up, and let the people who still play run their own.
---
TIL a Trump sits on the board that decides Fallouts fate...
---
Name calling and hurling insults isn't criticism.
---
We will get modding, just not how people are going to expect it to be.
---
It won't be getting a mod off nexus or nothing, it'll be  mods from bethesda and their controlled modders, bought and paid for in the atom shop
---
If I remember things right, the special effects on some unique items, like the burn damage on Perfect Storm, the sneak bonuses on The Fixer, the increased durability on All Rise or the anti-robot bonuses on the Voice of Set, are implemented using the 4th and 5th legendary slot. In that sense, a 3\* Fixer is, in fact if not in name, a 4\* legendary weapon.
---
"  13 a month to have (a shitty version of) 'private servers' "
---
There fixed that for you, it is even worse then you initially said :D
---
I reinstalled my 76 in early September in anticipation of Wastelanders. Just uninstalled, probably won't be reinstalling. 
---
Also I went back to Fallout 4 and got all my favorite mods working. Even with the issues I have with Fallout 4's world feeling empty and devoid of non-radiant content, it's baisically just playing the fallout 76 I hoped for alone. Which, let's face it, is how most people play 76 by now.
---
What a sad fate for a game with such potential. All they needed to do was make fallout 4 but co-op. But instead, their lust for our hard earned caps saw them try everything but.
---
Ahh so your one of the mythical whales that game devs cater to now.
---
You and the other mindless husks who bought this buggy mess deserve the worst.
---
Nope i just really like the game
---
You'll be back. Im 5 or 6 hrs in outer worlds and its good, but sorry....it ain't nv good. I will say the voice acting is superior, but the gunplay is weak and the AI is dumb as hell. There's also really no need to do another playthrough to do another build cause it doesn't seem so far that you have to choose 1 or the other (when it comes to perks/skills). I haven't touched melee points but I can spend credits to upgrade melee weapons and go whack everything to death easily.
---
Good game, def recommend a playthrough but everybody saying theyre leaving f76 for outer worlds.....its only temporary at best lol
---
Nah. Downvote away, but Bethesda flat-out promised that this wouldn't happen. It's greed at an EA level, and I won't support it.
---
Just wait until wastelander and see, go play other games
---
Pete "Cosmetic Only" Hines, everybody.
---
yeah, this is conspiracy - people target Fallout 76 for no reason, just for sake of trolling. Cool story
---
HOLY SHIT!!! I forgot I have 3 months for 5$! I played Bloodstained then forgot about it!!!
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
The hates pretty much just coming from one side, let me see- grief anyone in ncr  costume, you people are all dumb etc etc. I have only seen one post going the other way, but maybe I am biased having purchased it.
---
We all play games, we don't have to agree, but some of this crap is just rediculous
---
As I have put in a couple of posts, if it makes you that unhappy- then please stop playing as its not healthy to be so enraged.
---
Todd didn't steal your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend or anything else &amp; either did the players who purchased fallout 1st.
---
If your pissed at Bethesda, that's fine, I just draw the line with some of this other crap.
---
ofcourse you dont... only couple special haters have that problem
---
Fallout and I had some great times, the amount of hours between 3/NV/4/76 have been countless and I think no matter what course correction happens, the best is behind us. Sort of the way I feel about marvel movies, it‚Äôs been an incredible run and if that‚Äôs the peak then I‚Äôll remember those and move on. I‚Äôm good. No expectations moving forward. 
---
But I truly hope this blatant disregard for the gaming community is a bump in the road and not the status quo moving forward.
---
People warned you. Over and over. By the time Fallout 76 released, it was already clear Bethesda should not be trusted.
---
Yeah, what the hell is up with the ap drain upon being hit
---
you can't upgrade to win10?
---
Wasn't that free for a time?
---
Um I love the game and have fallout 1st and 2300 hours in the game...I'm not going anywhere. Like you obiviously dont get what "side" I'm on
---
Lol you don't change my mind weirdo
---
I've no doubt but I think it will be awhile chum
---
You can and should, its called empathy and not supporting terrible practices that imo, might make you some money now, at the cost of a decent chunk of the playerbase. Bethesda doesn't care.
---
Feels like a situation similar to all those kickstarters that take people's money and do nothing with it. For this games sake Wastelanders better be amazingly mindblowing, but I know better at this point than believing thats going to happen.
---
Its cool that you enjoy the game as it is, but fuck, don't  support these kinds of shit. If this works out I can only imagine the cancer their other games will be in the future.
---
At least the dude has some principles. Maybe not enough to discourage anti-consumer monetisation practices but still, I'll take it :)
---
Respect your opinion but look forward to putting together my own.
---
Private servers, higher item limits, portable mini-camps have been the most requested features since launch. They created excuses for not having them due to technical issues. But it turns out if you pay 100 bucks it's apparently not a problem for them.
---
I feel you.
---
But I guess that this "Road" is already waaay too long and waaay to bumpy to even consider driving on. 
---
If you catch my draft.
---
&gt; own every fallout game except 76
---
That's a quote from u on another thread. Why are you even here except to troll? I can't imagine the sad lonely life that comes into a sub dedicated to a game you don't even play. Now that is sad son, very sad.
---
Thank you good sir.
---
Sick of all these damn looters and polluters.
---
If ‚Äúgetting used to it‚Äù is your response to racism in this game I won‚Äôt. If ‚Äúgetting used to it‚Äù is a response to getting killed by players with better gear and skill set well yeah, that makes sense.
---
It wasn't aimed at you, it was a general comment
---
Sorry, thought it was aimed at me.
---
you are beyond saving, my dude. I'll better just laugh while I'm playing Outer Worlds for 5 bucks üòÇ
---
For sure man. I think every fallout fan will find enjoyment in it just for the fact of what type of game it is. As I said, def recommend giving it a playthrough.
---
Keep buyin' shit from Bethesda, I'll keep laughing from those who do it.
---
So that means forever...
---
Does Outer Worlds play like New Vegas?
---
I don't play 76, I'm just lurking here because the news is so wild to me. I have a question though: are you able to host a private world yourself? If not, I think what everyone's pissed about is... that they'd like to do that. Tons of games allow players to open a private world that is run on their own PC and invite friends to it. Minecraft, Rust, Ark, Day Z are four I own where I can do just that. Minecraft has both, the option to host your own world, or pay to have them host it for you (and it's only like $3 a month, lol).
---
If they don't even give you the option without paying to use their servers, that's a serious rip off. They would be intentionally not putting in a very basic feature so that the only way you could have that experience is to pay them to provide it for you.
---
These aren't opposite opinions so much as just hate at others and name calling.
---
Honestly surprised the whole video wasn't just him trying to keep himself from laughing to death.
---
Are you sure you don't have the Somerset in your inventory as well? If this is what I think it is, that glitch is nothing new. When a quest reward is a specific legendary/unique item, there is always the possibility that in addition to the one that is added to your inventory, a second version of the item is spawned on the ground nearby. This second item can not be picked up and generally displays only a generic item description instead of the name of the drop, e.g. "1\* .44 Pistol" instead of "Somerset Special". I've had this happen myself with both Perfect Storm and Daisycutter (and countless silo code fragments).

I swear! It's like peoole refuse to see the hands in their pockets. You know, I understand that making video games  is a huge undertaking and I would even understand if all or some of the money went towards the development teams, but realistically the developers aren't the ones seeing the profits from the monetization.  developers WANT to make fun and engaging games but with pressure from higher ups to 1. Pump out games quickly and 2. Monetize everything its probably even more difficult to make a game around a monetization scheme than to just make the game.  I've never heard of any news of issues with the store in fallout 76 becausethat was the focal point they HAD to make sure that worked in every update. Like this guy
---
 https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0lt2z/ive_compiled_a_list_of_all_known_bugs_in_fallout/
---
Has an entire list of bugs (and its a very long one) but would you look at that! Issues with the store are nowhere to be found unless I missed it at some point because there have been a lot of bugs.
---
Can you rush to the toilet before you post... To stay in our good graces? I think you shit yourself coming up with this post.
---
So this isn't true.
---
I had a private world went to the gold club and proceeded to find two legendary ghouls, a wendigo and about 50 golfers.
---
I have NEVER seen that many before.
---
Even outside the front entrance near the train station there were mobs.
---
If you want to find more enemies, play private
---
It's not the community, just one part
---
Always two sides to a coin
---
Nice work bud! Awfully nice of you to do so :)
---
The fact that a limitless scrap box isn't base game is pretty fucked to me.
---
That makes me feel loads better, I thought I was having a bug
---
You won't like the rest of the patch notes. No greenhouses in workshops
---
a)This is not stupid they are exercising predatory behaviour
---
B)"fans ripping each other apart" nah everyones chilling my man
---
C)Its not a big deal just go with the flow and pick a side
---
i'v been saying this since they released the repair kits, i wish i was a famous youtuber so i could have got the message across :(
---
I sure fucking hope not
---
Well you‚Äôre way off then. I‚Äôm mortgage free and have about $1000 spare per month, and I‚Äôm not getting it. It‚Äôs a waste of money
---
We still need 60 thenü§î
---
At the end of the day, it's not Zenimax whispering in Bethesda's ear. It's Bethesda for making the decisions and programming them in. This is solely on Bethesda.
---
only 8 players can join a private server, not 24
---
One part of the what? 
---
Community.
---
So is the community complaining? 
---
because a lot of people just uninstalled the game. Only whales left
---
Great....input from 2 more people!
---
I REPEAT. 
---
WHITE KNIGHT SPOTTED!
---
Fancy way to ask everyone to keep crying so you can all get what you want for free.
---
Be a man and vote with your wallet, either buy what you want or lay low and stop whining.
---
Is it because of how you expect it to trend or becaude of what is actually currently offered?
---
I'm sure they expected larger sales to carry the game further when they made those promises. Not necessarily excusing it, but if it's the reality of further free content (I know, big gap, especially with Wastelanders delay) or loss of free content updates and a zombie game, I'd rather keep this game going for now.
---
The mtx currently don't offer a true advantage. They're more like QoL.. Which can be argued regarding ethics.  The bigger problem I think is the tiered pricing. As it is, it's a tax on the poor.  Easier for most to spend 12.99 a month than to drop 100 at once to sub. That seems classist.
---
That's just, like, your opinion. You do what you want with your money after all.
---
As we will.
---
I think otherwise - those who bought 1st and those who didn't. I think it's the beginning of the end of this game and can't wait for another genius ideas from bethesda to steal more money form people who still believe this game can be save...
---
Yeah. Less copies sold means less players. Less players means less potential buyers for microtransactions.
---
Its just a question dickhead.
---
Who cares if they are racist? Let me guess... This is white guys spouting shit at someone else? No asian is ever racist... Nope not ever. Black guys in murica.... Nope victims. Hispanic... They love everyone all the time. No matter what.
---
Report cheaters and dunk on people you dont like. Don't do.... What every racist cunt wants you to.
---
Downvoted me and then deleted his post LOL
---
Compulsive spenders are the only reason Bethesda isn't bankrupt.
---
Same. It's not true. The private servers are sick. Just loads of haters who believe articles over fellow players
---
Not the whole community, people are still playing, people are buying the subscription.
---
We are all different &amp; there for have diffetent views.
---
I meant get used to living on earth. Adapt and overcome.
---
Bethesda releases a bugged update, who would have thought that?
---
"If you pay for 1st, you're an absolute moron"
---
FTFY
---
U serious?
---
Being an online game, they'll be compelled to treat it differently than a fallout bug that's been there since FO3.  
---
For starter, they're adding test servers.
---
That would have been why fallout 1st was released when it was, it's a business trying to make money.
---
üëèLight wood laminateüëè
---
There is no issue, I have played and the servers are great.
---
Loads and loads of enemies.
---
So many they fight each other.
---
Just turns out when you play a private server you actually notice enemies fighting each other.
---
Also to the people saying there were dead ghouls at whitespring.
---
No shit the guards kill them, and there were loads? +!
---
If you have ever bought a single atom then 1st is for you. Worth.
---
I checked then I logged out and uninstalled
---
At launch. I think a number of those bugs have since been fixed.
---
Is what I originally thought,  but a lot of comments here changed my mind about it to be honest. 
---
It shows how you can vote with your wallet and how people can Missusdenrstand the state of things. I am glad I made this post to be completely honest, it made me see what 76 has to offer and how you really dont need to pay for anything.
---
Bethesda are such mensch. Supporting a studio that helped them elevate one of their core franchises.
---
Chris Avalone was such a darling thanking Bethesda for helping out with The Outer Worlds. The fellowship of gaming developers is strong my friends.
---
It's not valid to compare it with Outer Worlds. They are fundamentally different games. If you want to play Outer Worlds play it.
---
Same. It was probably the best game session I have had. 3 legendaries in about 5 mind at the gold club
---
if a computer breaks with the game installed does that mean that forever long their records will show that one guy is forever playing the game?
---
It's not true. I have played and its great. Tons of enemies and no lag
---
If you have to explain it's satire, it failed as satire. It's a very Jeb Bush "please clap" moment.
---
A little bit
---
Thanks God we got you foxes around not falling into this very subtle trap. Lol.
---
Just pay up if you want something, if you don't want to spend the money just mind your business then.
---
We want it, we like it, we buy it.
---
Its not about price but principle.
---
These private servers are 100% VM‚Äôs. That‚Äôs why some people are thrown into a world with already looted items and dead NPC‚Äôs‚Äîthe game is supposed to tear down that VM and reset it at log off, and it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs being reallocated before being reset. Or, it‚Äôs suspended and migrated. 
---
My guess is that this is probably why the ScrapBoxes aren‚Äôt working correctly either. Players deposit items but the value isn‚Äôt being saved. It gets torn down when the VM gets torn down. All speculation on my part.
---
Its like a bad soap opera, with incredibly needy people, celebrating their imaginary relationship with Bethesda, as a romance gone bad. 
---
 Geezus fuck.
---
Except that it did the opposite. The only reason I even remembered the Outer Worlds existed is because of all this talk about it compared to Bugthesda, so I'm definitely buying that game now! Well almost definitely. Can anyone help me on whether or not I need an Epic account to play the Xbox edition? I refuse to use Epic so that'll be the only thing to keep me from getting it. But thankfully I know to stop getting anything Bethesda.
---
\*bold-faced lying
---
Oh hell no. They're probably already rushing Wastelanders as it is to get it done by Q1 2020.
---
I don't think the delay of Wastelanders was to improve the quality. I think it was to get it to even a playable state.
---
Let‚Äôs kill those racists together. I‚Äôm game,
---
In the October 1 patch. They said something like maybe bringing it back after the Wastelanders release.
---
There is not much choice when your parent company tells you what to do.
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the irony in the post. Thought it was a funny thought though. I‚Äôm not sure whether you need an epic account or not, but I‚Äôm pretty sure you can get the game for a dollar with the game pass thing they have going on Xbox.
---
What's people's obsession with calling Bethesda Bathesda? Is there something about baths that I'm missing?
---
Emphasis on "some." Sadly they'll likely never give you all that stuff for free that's in the Fallout 1st Subscription, even though it ALL should be free. With how crap and unfinished the game is, to charge for any new content is just literally throwing insults at you.
---
Probably gonna rotate in 1st. Makes 0 sense to put in the Atom Shop. Unless you are gonna cancel 1st the next month XD
---
I enjoyed a lot of F3 when it got released. You see F2 was the game of my childhood and F3 was the best thing we could get after a very long wait and it didn't look bad on it's own, but i gotta admit that after the release of NV i just couldn't go back to play F3 as well. It just didn't have the same depth and felt very empty and boring indeed. As for F4 it seems that Bethesda learned a lot from NV so overall F4 was a very good game and settlements added a lot of replayability to it. Story was pretty good especially for a cyberpunk sucker like myself and Far Harbor in my opinion was the best thing Bethesda ever done (i know people hated virtual reality puzzles but man, as a fan of Gibson's stuff and movies like Lawnmover man i had a nerdgasm). So F4 was the main reason I've put so much faith in F76 but it's been a year filled mostly with disappointment and i've been loosing faith very rapidly.
---
I love the Fallout world but dislike playing single player games, instead opting for co-op so this game was meant to be the dream. At first I wasn‚Äôt too miffed about the subscription - it was worth it for the atoms alone, but then I started remembering how Bethesda promised they were only going to put cosmetics behind a pay wall, and how increasing the scrap limit was technologically difficult and it‚Äôs put a sour taste on the whole thing... damn. I guess I‚Äôll just hold my breath out for a Fallout 4 co-op mod :(
---
Social Darwinism. Did you make that up? If you are actually interested in these things, this is a really good place to start:

---
You haven't bought the game &amp; there for have probably never played except for the free week at most &amp; yet your an expert &amp; giving your opinion on something you obviously know nothing about.
---
I don't mind informed discussion, but all this crap from people who haven't even played the game.
---
Go back to your troll cave under the  bridge you came from
---
Found the whale
---
And remember how they made it seem like it couldn't be unlimited? I thought that was BS back then. Now we know it is.
---
Remaster it
---
Yes, but it's the fault of those buying the subscription that Bethesda even does this. They do it BECAUSE people will buy it ANYWAYS. So those are the bad parts of the community. I have no problem with people enjoying a bad game (and Fallout 76 is objectively bad) but the problem comes when they're making it worse for everyone else because they're willing to buy over-priced buggy crap so why would Bethesda make it better when people will buy it anyways?
---
The private servers are dope and allow massive spawns of enemies
---
Beep boop
---
Yeah, like, what? A number on a server with very little people on it can't be unlimited. Or even if it can, it has to be so cripplingly small that you can't even do two runs without it filling up? And that was early game, I haven't played since like level 12.
---
If we would get REAL servers, where our friends can join at will even without us, i would be happy to pay 100$ a year!
---
What? You can call it a hate-fest if you want and honestly a bit of it just is. However, a significant portion of the posts and comment are fair and reasoned criticism of the game and of the developer.
---
This isn't just coming out of no-where. Bethesda earned this criticism.
---
However, if you want a safe space, there's r/fo76FilthyCasuals. They actually have a rule against negativity and bashing. I'm sure you'll feel right at home there!
---
I would disagree, I think he was preemptive for the people who don't understand the satire so he didn't have to reply to them saying it was. I think it was fine.
---
Who is making these sleazy decisions ?  Talk about a fall from grace, my goodness. Do the powers that be at Bethesda even weigh the possible consequences of their decision making ?  Is it even a process where they have some clue of the negative feedback (in addition to...) they could receive ?  They don't care... that's just obvious.  And the Outer Worlds is being released within a few hours... lol. 
---
So long Bethesda, thanks for some great gaming memories... But this has left a bad taste in my mouth that will last a while.
---
Oh I see. You mean they "made" the company what it is today. Figuratively. Yeah that's not a "business term". It's arguably not even true. And it wouldn't prevent a person from being fired.
---
It‚Äôs not live. He chooses to post videos with them in it. I don‚Äôt see him complaining about them  . I have no love for any of those involved in the video and don‚Äôt like the tactics either side uses but if they want to go at each let them .
---
Yeah, but why say that you won't buy future games? Maybe a future game like Elder Scrolls 6 will be good. We have no reason to believe that it will be, but that's irrelevant.
---
Here's how I see it.: Literally never pre order a game no matter how good it looks. Once it releases, wait a week to see what the response is. If its good, buy it. If it isn't, don't. Only buy a game if you know its good. And if its good, then here's no reason not to buy it. If Elder Scrolls 6 turns out to be great, I'm not gonna refuse to buy it because 76 sucked. That makes no sense. The only deciding factor on whether to buy a product is whether its worth the money. Previous experiences with products have no relevance.
---
Not that impressed by TOW actually. Its OK but really they have made it a little too, I dunno CODy. The combat is meh, Fallout 76 is better at that for sure.
---
 If you want a story and cute NPCs, this game is for you. ;)
---
Take this rage and go play The Outer World! It‚Äôs fucking amazing!
---
Oh. So now you're saying mainstream (as opposed to inventing it etc) and excluding websites. Right. Cause one has to be right of course. As I said, I worked for one of the big AAA game company in the mid-late 90s and we were already looking at doing micrtotransactions based on the huge success of things like neopets. The game I was designing didn't make the light of day though due to licensing issues but it might have ended up being one of the first out the door if it had. There was also a Korean game that was "free" and had microtransactions (can't remember the name of it). And then Runescape which of course you don't consider a "mainstream" game cause it was browser based.
---
And then of course all the facebook "games", that you don't see as games either, that were long before Oblivion. Or how about MapleStory which was long before Oblivion. But I guess that doesn't count cause you wound't consider that "mainstream" either. Game companies couldn't care less about what you might consider "mainstream". They were drooling over the success of those other "games" and they were all working on ways to get it into their standard offerings way back when I was working in that business.
---
I‚Äôve been tossing around the idea of getting it. Although I‚Äôm still trying to find the time for Borderlands 3 still...
---
Read the title of the smaller image and you will get it.
---
I dont want a safe place so you can take your condensation on somewhere else. And second, talking down on and hating people who got the Subscription isn't criticism of Bethesda, it's being hateful to others for no reason other than to be spiteful cause of your own personal opinions on the game.
---
Lol I was there for the ridiculous horse armor days. And no not really I played the fuck out of oblivion, but eventually stopped with finishing it and I played skyrim and got bored fairly quickly ended up giving it away to a friend of mine, but let me tell you about the MONTHS I spent playing Fallout 3. I didn't want to stop until I figured out the entire lore, explored ever corner, finished every mission collected every bobblehead. Part of what made it fun was how alive it felt because of the NPCs  Apparently "16 times the detail" meant "the same graphics from Fallout 3" but booting up to 76 (when I was even able to) was all play this tape, read this terminal kill this thing, this thing is frozen in place an isnt dying, "what the fuck just killed me?", frame rate is dropping again, "why isn't my weapon dealing damage?", "WHY DO THESE GHOULS KEEP SPAWNING?!" I'VE CLEARD THIS AREA 12 TIMES ALREADY!" I had to stop playing it was not worth the price. And the no refund thing was super cool I didn't even want to fight it I just took it as an L.
---
For SEGA, there are these gambling thingies in japan (forget what name they are called) that are more profitable for them then the rest of their entire global game operation.
---
So basically Bethesda has 100% decided to enter into that echelon of companies that make big bank off of taking advantage of certain peoples unfortunate mental illness/compulsory obsessive abnormal behaviors..
---
How moral of them! What a great company they are now!
---
just did it about 10 time tonight, kept getting combat left arm, assualtron head, some water and radaway.
---
Your comment is irrelevant - what I do with my money isn‚Äôt the issue. You said that everyone who is unhappy with Fallout 1st is unhappy because they can‚Äôt afford it and I‚Äôm demonstrating that isn‚Äôt the case. Many people can afford it. It‚Äôs just vastly overpriced and a shitty business practice for those of us who have followed this game since the start
---
You can do what ever you want but I was burnt out on skyrim after I 100% it the first time no idea why people keep buying the same game over and over again. No wounder Bethesda believe they can get away with this ****
---
THANK YOU! OMG I've been singing this song for YEARS.
---
For all the people replying to this, here's how it works: big companies that make video games, EA, Activision, Bethesda and others, they don't just need to make a profit. Under capitalism, they are beholden to shareholders (the funding *capitalists*), and shareholders demand not just profit, but GROWTH. Every year these companies need to make MORE money, or their shareholders will fire the executives. In turn, those executives put increasingly insane demands on the people making the products ("16 times the detail").
---
Ever notice how, the bigger the company, the more they tend to make worse and worse games with more and more intrusive monetization schemes? Not only that, but the games need to appeal to wider and wider audiences to continue this growth, so they tend to piss off their player base by throwing in things that they think will bring in new players (\*ahem\* woke lady characters). This is all being done not so that the company can make money, but so that the company can make MORE money. That is how capitalism works. Capitalist support for artistic endeavors is inherently unsustainable for this reason. The endless demand for growth actually STIFLES the ability for people to be creative, take risks, and take the time needed to create a fully-finished products, because at a certain point, the expectation for growth is unrealistic. Only so many people are going to buy video games. Demanding growth beyond that won't work. You see similar issues with movies and other media as well.
---
In other words: it's not feminists or journalists ruining video games, it's capitalism. =)
---
Xbox I posted the prehalloween version to the fallout settlements a few weeks ago subreddit. I‚Äôm trying to stay away from the controversy at the moment. Don‚Äôt want to be lynched if people see how decked I am for Halloween lol. I got a lot of hate from my little teenage cousin already lol.

I lost all my junk i had yesterday. A year of Grinding down the drain Thanks Bethesda. It happen on PC. FIX YOUR GAME.

its for this very reason i knew fallout 76 would flop from the moment it was announced

What the hell is this? Is this some art-house shitpost that celebrates ignorance? WTF is a domingo threads?

Also, "Rabbid hole"? AH! This is an attempt at cross-promotion viral marketing between the Rabbid's franchise and The Outer Worlds, is it? Clever. Very clever.

"You've tried the best. Now try the rest. Spacer's Choice!"

---
Can't afford it, or don't want to, makes no difference.
---
It's funny that you compare this fallout 76 epic cluster f**K to social Darwinism. The concept of Darwinism as you know is survival of the fittest. Why then if you look at a company who admittantly would have a black tongue from all the lying they have done, are trying to survive. If you look historically Bethesda used to release a game, make money from it the release DLCs to prop up that income as the game became older. Rinse and repeat. But as they have received cash includes from their parent entities this no longer works and their parents want their money back. So how then r they do achieve this - make more money. So they make things cost etc etc. This seems to be a fair standard business practice. Just because people support this then maybe they are less concerned with the Bethesda business model but rather just like the game. Look at fortnite. They do the same thing the difference is they were honest about it. Businesses are there to make money. If you object don't spend it. Simple

Yikes. Kinda forgot Pete said that -- That's blatant false advertisement then.

What‚Äôs more pathetic

Some bashing a company they once loved for god awful behaviour.

What happened? They saw how EA was hated allot yet made huge amounts of revenue and decided it's time to abandon the player community and go after the money only.

People keep forgetting the quote about staying on the right side of the line. Just as damning as the cosmetics-only and all content free stuff.

So basically delete the sub forever is what you're saying?

Over two years? Are you playing from 2021?
---
Dodgy perk (reduces damage at the cost of AP)
---
I'm not understanding what your question is. Like what, what? The point is they said they couldn't give unlimited storage space, now they're saying they can (but pay up if you want it). Am I missing something?
---
Subscriptions work differently. 
---
You cancel them and get refunded immediatly.
---
Exactly. If there's a consistent motivation, it's not a slippery slope at all. You're just pointing out the constant. You can still go beyond that and be wrong again, but that's a different story.

I put a lot of detail into my campa. If anyone is on PC im Ninerschnitzle and currently have a bit of a spooky/cutesy cottage

This sounds so crazy that my gut tells me it is exactly how it will go down.  ::shudder::
---
Definitely great irony! It is funny haha. Oh I know but sadly I don't have the game pass haha, don't often enjoy having subscription services and I also like to own games I really want. But as long as I don't need an Epic account I'll pay the $60, though if I do need it, I won't buy it, because they got enough money from Epic.
---
They don't owe customers what they promised? They don't owe us honesty? We were promised that nothing but cosmetics was going to be purchasable with cash.
---
Mmmm yes keep fueling Bethesda's lust for money...I played this game ever since I got my Xbox One X last year and I found it so infuriating and boring that I have no idea how people could find this game fun. That being said, I enjoyed playing a Fallout game with my younger brother, as he loved playing Fallout 4 at the time. Bethesda is going to fall one way or another, and that fucking sucks to see such a reputable and beloved gaming studio fall but this shit is just pathetic. And yet people still defend this blatant cash grab of a game, why? Do you like just throwing your money out there and watching it go to waste? I'm not here to tell people how to spend their money but there has to be some fucking common sense before all of this right, or is this really how fucking low people can get?

this is a sandbox and not just a pure mmo. you ask yourself a lot of questions:

did i collect all the rare outfits?

did i succed in every expert raid?

didi solo the queen?
---
have i min/max my build?
---
have i min/max my armor/weapons?
---
do i have unlocked all the backpack mods?
---
do i ave unlocked all the alcohol recipes?
---
there is so much to do, it just dont have a "!" when you reach max level.

Yeah man. I literally just jumped back in fo76 after not playing it for months in anticipation of wastelanders and... boy this was not the week to jump back on.

Bye!!

If this post gets auto-modded again I will throw my fucking computer out

 I don't actually like Borderlands. I have played a fair bit of the first 2 but not really for me.

 I do have a Stalker game running, but then I almost always do. ;)

Do it

As much as I think this sub is absolutely ridiculous, it‚Äôs just a video game. Nobody is a ‚Äòscum‚Äô for spending their money on it, it‚Äôs their money.
---
What if i played it for like 150 hours in last 3 months? Can i hate?
---
It also has shit they think are worth $150 in the store.
---
So yes, it can kinda be a good example, but also a bad one about MICRO transactions.
---
NV but only .1% less boring
---
Yeah I use the gamepass mainly for old games that I‚Äôd have to hunt down on eBay, or old corner shops for. What‚Äôs the controversy with Epic if you don‚Äôt mind me asking?
---
It's mostly about practice and a bit of luck really. Codes are easy to miss in a hurry. If you look at the map you will see that alpha always spawns in seed bank, delta spawns in big room with pumps, gamma spawns inside greenhouses most of the time (sometimes it can spawn on the outside of a greenhouse but very close to it's wall) and beta is a weird one: mostly it spawns inside the room with greenhouses but never inside greenhouses themselves and there is a few spots in the room with pumps too.

No, you spent 60$ and got exactly what they were selling, and which you decided to buy.
---
No, they don't owe you "honesty", they are a company, not a Christian club.
---
And also, they never promised anything, that's what you understood. And anyway, if you just take company statements on the letter, that's mostly your fault.
---
Thank you for the offer, but unfortunately it's for my strangle heart set. So I have to mod it my self
---
Stalker was a game I was not prepared for when I first got into it. Definitely a challenge and a different gameplay style/ environment to adjust to.
---
Have fun, my dude.
---
You do get to keep the ranger armor though. It's a valley move but im gonna buy a month.
---
Thanks, I guess I didn't see it between all the Fallout 1st posts!
---
Love the Vader reference, and glad you're not only leaving Fallout 76 for now but supporting THE OUTER WORLDS! As long as I don't have to use the Epic Store (since I count Epic almost as bad as Bethesda) I'll only support them if the Xbox version doesn't require an Epic Account, but I'll never support Fallout 76 even if it becomes better than Fallout New Vegas (though of course it never will).
---
I'd rather get loads of cosmetics and those get thrown into the free pool for $13/mo.
---
Hmm ok, fair point. 
---
(Sincere statement. Irony or condescension not intended).
---
Shill harder please. I'm trying to see if we can generate enough power if the bullshit your spewing to get Todd Howard through the rest of 2019
---
 Yeah its a bit beastly. I have the Oblivion Lost mod on Shadow of Chernobyl, one of my favourites, running now.  It has so many anomalies, you can fry dogs chasing you with a bit of open field running. ;)
---
If they didn't change it in this patch, you can mod someone else's SH PAs. I've made a lot of calibrated shocks and T Huds as well as Emergency Protocols for people - the difference is you have to drop frame equipped with parts you want to modify.
---
Makes no different to what?! I don‚Äôt know what your point is!
---
Are you saying ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt make a difference **why** you don‚Äôt want it, just that you don‚Äôt want it‚Äù? That‚Äôs revolutionary thinking there mate, thank you for enlightening me
---
Yeah its amusing to see all the hate.  Its a video game. Channel all that opinionated fervor into something more constructive. 
---
Im excited for mischief night.  I got into the game around the time of the faschnatt parade. Fun stuff. 
---
I really do think they're gonna put npcs behind a paywall unfortunately.  I can't see how they're gonna do it without private servers.
---
I could deal with the atom cost for outfits but ever since beta people have been asking for junk increase or just unlimited amount of space with box we get told it will cause game glitching glitches the we keep wishing for at least a decent amount of bank increase well they were listening however only those who pay 100 a year can use service who cares if it breaks if the subscription was better i could see a possibility for 100 a year however storage should be for all replace it with legendary scrap so a person can gamble for their choice loot box at vender maybe give monthly caps allowance but this is bethesda company of pay to play and future nuclear casino the next nba 2k wait till the next elderscrolls you wanna learn frostbite 10 dollars for spell pack through our store i enjoyed fallout 76 at first even with its bugs however now i have hung my hat up with this game i loved the pump shotgun and the moleminers and i loved the brotherhood story i dont love how it has been degraded even further thank you for letting me rant im off to play fallout 4 or new vegas
---
I'm not asking for a safe place. Thanks for the correction, that wasnt auto correct that was my inability to spell correctly. Again, feck off with the *condescension* I'm asking for them to lock the sub up. But I realize how futile that is because I can see that theres no use for Bethesda to respond because everyone will decide what they want to hear.
---
Judge all you want, but I put 2300 hours into this game and playing it with others and I find it incredibly stupid for people to attack others over people's own choices with their wallets.
---
Impressive, impressive indeed.
---
that must be what blocked my camp up there!
---
Agreed, never pre order a game. But the thing also is, even IF they make a game better than Skyrim or Fallout 3, you know what they've done and still might be willing to do later on with other games. And even IF a new Elder Scrolls or Fallout game came out better than all the rest, we don't know they WON'T monetize it to hell and back. 
---
Literally it's a trend now for companies to not have shitty monetization, UNTIL reviews come in for the games, then when people say it's great with no monetization, they put it in because there's no backlash (though I would call that false advertising). But the problem is you can't trust a game even IF it's released good now, that's how bad the gaming industry has become. I will refuse to buy a good Elder Scrolls 6 until a year or MORE after it's release to make CERTAIN they don't f\*\*k it up with monetization sh\*t. You feel me, friend? I disagree previous experiences have no relevance when it's the same company. And again, a game could release amazing and be destroyed later on.
---
Anytime.
---
Appreciate it, friend! Glad we could come to an agreement
---
Bopping around Grafton  for the "Kill 25 quest", he doesn't talk for Grafton Day or for the Protest one.
---
I think they didn't fix it so much as just muted him entirely.
---
Which is a shame.
---
They didn't, you did.
---
Am I missing something? Can I buy a refrigerator and store my food in there? O.o
---
And here you see a defeated individual, clinging on to a sinking ship due to the Sunken Cost Fallacy. Rather than engage in discourse on how to improve the situation, he insults and lashes out at those who *would* see the game improved.
---
Sad, really.
---
It's tempting but I am just done with the community around the games as a whole. It's gotten to negative and toxic for me and I just can't take it anymore
---
You do understand that when wastelanders drops there's going to be problems with it as well. What makes you think that there won't be? People got mad at me because I made a post about how I don't feel bad for people who bought the subscription and lost all their stuff even though I played very little of the game. They promised that the microtransactions would only be cosmetic and they backtracked on that. They asked the community what they wanted and then charge them for it.
---
&gt; Like this is it, they literally cannot go any lower
---
I feel like every passing week someone says this, and then Bethesda thinks of a new way to do even worse shit.
---
So space Cazadors
---
Dude you need to l2bush. Go into bushes. Think like a bush. Become the bush. It works.
---
Source: did it for 33 levels to get the Minigun skin. :D
---
Finish your quests
---
You feel or you're sure about it? They mentioned the bug that allowed to drop PAs painted with Atomic Shop paintjobs (including those from NW). Strangler Heart didn't have AS sign and you didn't have to use glitch to drop it. To be honest last Strangler Hearts modification I've done for my friend I've done before the patch, but I'm pretty sure it's still works as before...
---
there might be space cazadors ? i don‚Äôt know, and i don‚Äôt care either
---
I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic about Halo Infinite but Death Stranding has my attention currently haha 
---
You play The Old Republic right? Is it worth investing in? I‚Äôve been eyeing it
---
As I said, I did a fresh copy of all the file after the update, but when I launch the new .exe, desktop goes black and then it crash immediately.
---
Maybe you are part of the fallout 4, because you have issues.
---
Uh huh. Keep deluding yourself. I've hedged my bets and when it shows, I'll just drop the game or continue playing.
---
They‚Äôre either intentionally giving money to hucksters or they‚Äôre morons. Absolute fucking morons. I guess pick your poison. But they‚Äôre actively making something I enjoy worse by their very existence in either scenario.
---
I finished the story and like starting scorched earth for myself and other players. I still enjoy it. I dig exploring too. To each their own though.
---
Makes sense, that's a good use for it! Oh and I don't mind at all! Epic's launcher compared to Steam, just sucks. It literally doesn't even have a SHOPPING CART. You have to buy games individually and put in your card info every time, and a user was literally suspended from being able to buy anything because of "suspicious activity." The suspicious activity was him buying 3 games consecutively, because he had to make them 3 separate transactions because THEY don't have a shopping cart option, he had to pay the price for it. 
---
____________________
---
Also, they're not trying to make their launcher better, they're just grabbing Epic Exclusives. That's when they go to a game, most often ones on many Steam Wishlists, and they offer them a ton of money to ONLY release their game on the Epic store. They even go to KICKSTARTER public-funded games that PROMISED Steam-Keys, and get them to backtrack on their word and go Epic Exclusive. Apparently the money they offer is what that game likely would've made if released on Steam, that way the company doesn't take a loss, they basically make their money back and then some before selling a single copy of the game, and THEN get all that extra money when they actually sell the game. It's sleazy. 
---
So Epic is FORCING people to use their platform rather than making it better so people WANT to, and I will NEVER be forced to use it. I just won't support games on it, even ones like The Outer Worlds I desperately want.
---
 That's what a post apocalyptic world will do to a person.  Its supposed to make you feel sad,  alone, and unsure.
---
I would've been badly with a camp increase, not a stash increase
---
Bethesda wants you to give them both sides of your coin.  And then they want all your other coins.
---
It's pretty common for anyone being publicly known this days to recieve death treats.
---
People feel much safer when being anonymous (*or at least believing that they are*) and will say things that they would never ever say in the real world.
---
You didn't even need to do something controversial today to recieve death treats. It's already enough to have a different political opinion or just being connected to something or someone (*like the community manager to FO76*) to reviece threats.
---
I can asure you that the Fallout Community Managers are recieving such threats. It's sad but it's the realtiy today.
---
My worlds were a bit desolate too. Fought the SBQ practically alone as the two other players mostly hid in their survival tents and used pee shooters to tag adds. Yes, this was on a public server.
---
I am not sure, how ever I don't want to risk it haha. My schedule has switch to nights now so the time I'm off no longer lines up with my raid crew and I'd hate to lose my helm lol
---
i get what you are saying, but the same thing can be said about ppl that post something negative, then the fan boys comes out off the wood work and they do the same things you posted, and yet you left them out. 
---
we just need to relearn how to get along with ppl. I sure wont be calling ppl that decide to support them any names. but I sure have been call all kinds off names when I post/ disagree about something along with get downvote to hell. 
---
anyways you do you and I do wish BGS would get thier heads out off their asses but for some off us it might be too late. 
---
have a good day.
---
They are selling only 3 values in First World. 1. Bevis Griefer and his girlfriends (although that gives womankind a slight) will NOT be there. 2. Infinate, we pray to Beth Almighty, storage of junk. 3. Enhanced fast travel mat. So if the world is not pristine that is simply the nature of a new instance, period. In adventure is that mag or bobble Always there, no. So quit crying and thank Lord Beth you have friends not transient scum.
---
Oh they‚Äôre definitely morons, especially now we know the private servers aren‚Äôt really private servers at all. I feel like this was always going to happen though, wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if wastelanders was the last proper update for this game.
---
Raiders always want everything for free, you justice sucking Brotherhood trollop!
---
$12.99 US to $19.07AUD + GST is no more than $20.98. Charing $22.99 AUD. No thanks.
---
All hail the God king networkviking91, who couldn't be bothered with an original name, who can determine the scope of a person's thoughts by a single comment. Hail. Hail.
---
When we talk about ‚Äúfittest‚Äù in the sense of survival, if people are still mating then they are fit and survived.  So in this case all the people defending would go off and mate together therefore becoming ‚Äúfit‚Äù
---
Had to clarify your analogy of trying to call someone stupid.
---
It's literally just this sub, it's filled with haters and teenagers with nothing else to do.
---
Much more mature population on this other sub, you will enjoy it.
---
Tactics that both sides uses? What tactics do we use that is as bad as RACISM??
---
yea, we DEMANDED more microtransactions! 
---
wait....what.... WHO THE FUCK demanded more? (the voices in Todd Howard's head maybe)
---
Democracy is not negotiable.
---
All you have to do is get one door in your camp locked, ask a friend to help you - you drop the frame, if he can enter it means you can trade/get your armor modified by others. I'm on PC and know most Ultracite mods, fully modified mine Strangler Heart set and at least 10 sets of other players...
---
My biggest question is, when will Bethesda respond to the backlash? Oh they won't? You mean like every other time they release microtransactions that causes backlash?
---
There'll always be problems. It's a Bethesda game. You're either staying on the ship or you never got on.
---
Announce that Fallout 76, in its current state, is being ported to mobile as a F2P game, and to Amazon Echo for a low monthly subscription fee.
---
Nah mate, was bored and went back through your comments history. Same bloviating about how everyone but you is an uneducated peasant and how you're the King Gamer. 
---
What's it like having so little going on in your life you've gotta come on here and prove to every username you're hot shit?
---
On consoles mate. The prices almost never go down for this game
---
Eat shit you fucking morons
---
honestly...you deserve it for supporting this shit company by playing their broken ass product. anyone who plays it deserves ridicule and loathing. stop supporing companies that ruin game industry you fucking schmucks. same goes fo EA games
---
The game is still fucking broken and boring so what's your point
---
i know... like outer worlds, buy once, its yours, no catches, no bullshit, no desperate cash grabbing, no thumbing their nose at their community -  a spiritual successor to fallout nv and kotor2 style gameplay, with NO MTX... im playing it and its damn good - i even have fallout 76 and the bethesda game launcher uninstalled
---
This cesspool of a sub has been a bastion of shilling, and even the sheep are angry. That's saying something.
---
&gt;Judge all you want
---
&gt; If you choose to stay here, that's on you dude. No judgement either way. 
---
&gt; everyone will decide what they want to hear. 
---
Point taken. Can't fault you there. At least you're internally consistent with your own perspective.
---
I want 76 to come back so bad. It‚Äôs why I have to leave it for now. If you love something let it go
---
You sound like a real asshole. Expecting companies to lie to customers is a shit attitude. Corporations are run by people and we need to punish those who are bad actors.
---
Other futuristic underwear includes laser pants and atomic pants. Get yours tomorrow!
---
That‚Äôs a way to put it, too!
---
In either case, the conclusion is the same. In a subreddit full of vocal support and appreciation for the game, the prevailing voice is extremely critical.
---
It's fun to play.
---
That‚Äôs the spirit!
---
Lol. King gamer, you're the one who said it. Don't be a clown. Also learn what bloviate means. People like you cheapen words for the sake of making a weak argument sound "better". Just like the argumentive style of Ben Shillpiro.  The word you're looking for is 'concise.'
---
But I guess my comments would seem like a lot to one with a 3rd grade reading comprehension.
---
I bought the game for $60, then wished I waited a week and got it $30. I haven't spent a cent more. I enjoy the gameplay loop. The potential is still there.
---
Yes, similar to the one from Fallout 4. My other half bought it for me. I haven't used it much and a lot is out of date. It states that bobble heads last 10 hours!
---
It's simply you being too naive.
---
"Go under"  ?    That's not going to happen. They're getting into the android/iOS market soon, then they'll leave this AAA stuff behind them with plenty of bridges burned... but they'll have a new consumer base, the smartphone gamer.  That's the future, at least that's where the big money is.
---
Didn't they say a while back they were slowly going to add more storage in the game, but it would take a while? And now they're trying to charge us for it? Holy hell this is a new low
---
I'm sorry, sir. r/fo76FilthyCasuals is down the all to the left. Next to the ball pit.
---
Didn't launch the game yet since the update. Any link/video where I can hear it?
---
It makes me miss new Vegas, but personally it‚Äôs just as compelling and engaging so I‚Äôm loving every second
---
next patch : legendary creatures no longer spawn on adventure mode
---
&gt; In what way is a corporation making a profit and for paying its employees unethical.  It's entire purpose, regardless of what product,  is to make a profit. Without profit  there is no corporation
---
I'm not saying making a profit, on it's own, is unethical. I'm saying the means of making that profit are. Bethesda's choices are giving the majority of people the impression that they care more about making money than about the experience they've created, or those they've created it for. This subscription service is not needed to pay its employees or design and implement the features it provides. 
---
Therefore I don't think it's unreasonable to say that Bethesda are using people as a means to the end of making a profit. If they were using their profit as a means to the ends of improving the game and paying their employees, that would be a different story. But Bethesda's past actions have suggested otherwise.
---
I deleted my previous response cause it was shitty. 
---
Enjoy your game man, no one is saying you have to stop playing.
---
My mistake. Thought I remembered 2017. Edited.
---
Well at least they‚Äôve admitted it. I‚Äôm still waiting for a reply from my ticket.
---
Was it when I bought the game for the ps4 and pc or was it when I bought some atom? Where did I ruin the game? Maybe it was when I told my friends that they should really give it a shot. I'm trying to figure where I fucked it up. 
---
There was that time I emailed Todd and said "you know what would be a kick ass idea? Delay the major DLC till 2020 and add a subscription service on a half-ass game"
---
You can get it on the Microsoft store/Xbox desktop app. That‚Äôs what I did and that way more money goes to obsidian since they‚Äôre owned by microsoft
---
Bethesda: "Any ideas for more free content?"
---
Players: "How about this?"
---
Bethesda: "Sure! That'll be $5.99."
---
Godspeed
---
&gt; A lot of comments defending BGS seem to have a fuck ton of downvotes and that upsets me. 
---
Where do you think you are? I've seen the most inane things get upvoted like crazy while well thought out posts downvoted to hell, sometimes for just posting during the wrong time of day.
---
It's fine that you don't want to stick around here if it's not for you. Bit of a dick move to be catty about it on the way out though.
---
Thanks.  After decades of myself resisting this sort of thing, some things in the gaming industry won't change until we change government policy and regulations.
---
Yep, Swtor. It's been pretty fun so far. I played at launch years and years ago but just for a little bit, came back to it a few weeks ago and havent been able to put it down.
---
I'd definitely check it out, the most recent expansion came out earlier this week and when it dropped it made 2 of the expansions (Rise of the Hutt Cartel and Shadow of Revan) free for f2p players. Theres a lot of game that can be enjoyed for free but they do have some odd restrictions for f2p players like you cant equip end game gear, tho you dont need to unless you are doing like end game raiding. They got a nice system where if you sub for a month you unlock ALL the current expansions forever; so even if you just sub for 1 month and cancel you'll still own all the expansions.
---
Its at least worth a few hours to see if it's something youd enjoy. Now is the best time too as I'm sure the player population has seen a decent boost due to the new expansion.
---
I never thought that I'd agree with Fortnite being better than anything. You have left me a changed man.
---
I did a Scorched last night - probably the most buggy one I have done. Also the enemies felt like they have been buffed etc.
---
I think BGS have been tinkering behind the scenes.
---
That's the biggest problem. You know they're going to be bugs and glitches in the game and even though you get completely taken advantage of you're going to stay on the ship.
---
Just the community. Todd Howard was right when he said that Fallout 76 has one of the best communities in gaming. The studio and the game are not deserving of the credit for this but still, the community still rocks.
---
I'm so happy that we on the whole (there will always be outliers) look out for each other, both in game as well as with shitty practices outside of the game.
---
Heretic! ASDLeftAlt is the one true way. The evil one inflicted this cramped WASD thing on you all. ;)
---
This game hasnt operated in good faith in so long...... Why are people suprised? lmaoo
---
Why are you in this sub if you don‚Äôt even have the game?
---
I think we should be mad about the pricing of it too.
---
Oh I think they will be. But it's just mods from Bethesda, that's obvious and people are oddly expecting something else.
---
If they keep shooting you in the butt, are you the one with all the arseholes? ;P
---
Other than it not being the RPG game that people wanted, what issues did it have?
---
okay yeah my wording was wrong i know they do listen they just always find a way to screw us over and then not fix the problem or learn from the mistake.
---
Too bad they don't have the matching helmet variants of the riot, elite and advanced riot armors in the files.
---
 And if you are really bored, change sides randomly for more hilarity.
---
You contributed when you made this post.
---
Well turrets and collectors can be mostly build by the workshops own resources. Use the perk that makes them all cheaper.
---
^^^^^
---
The problem is they know exactly what they want.
---
Money.
---
free
---
Come on bruh. We have legitimate criticisms of Bethesda and of the game. No need for being a shitting basking in the wake of this criticism.
---
I dont regret nothing especially if it put sand in your vagina.
---
What do you mean, I do have the game. I just don't play it or did you not read what I wrote?
---
Awesome, appreciate it! I will definitely go that route that, thanks for the info.
---
And for Nvidia cards, in your Nvidia Fallout 76 game settings: Performance in Power Saving, and Fast in Vsync can help quite a bit.
---
Funny thing is i uninstalled right before they announced Fallout 1st. I cant keep playing such a mess of a game, most of the problems havent even been addressed and its been almost a year since release. Thankfully i only wasted 35euros on this horrible piece of software.
---
From the main developper of the unofficial patch itself " we cannot provide support for the VR version of the game since Bethesda  themselves do not support modding it and have said that's not possible "
---
It also doesn't support the DLCs apparently.
---
Are you saying you haven't played any Bethesda game since Morrowind? Because every single Bethesda game since then have been full of bugs.
---
What an educated little person you are.
---
So, the riot gear from Lonesome Road is also on its way. Cool, I always preferred those versions over the NCR gear if I'm to be fully honest. This is interesting, but if it's locked behind their ridiculous subscription I'll never get it.
---
Whole lotta commie stuff happening in that datamine, too - wonder if that's just a bunch of themed gear or if it'll have any ties to Wastelanders down the road. The black sweater on that one outfit is actually a really good look, shame it's so explicitly Chinese-themed (which clashes with my character aesthetic)
---
Y‚Äôall realise your wasting your life collecting things that aren‚Äôt even real. And supporting a trash fire in the process
---
Ahh damn, now you ruined my day.
---
The older you grow, the more you appreciate finer things in life, like a nice bush. True story.
---
Oh no no no. I would be VERY surprised if there aren't mods for private worlds.
---
The thing you're not getting is that they want to sell you the mods as well. You know, like the creation club. Nexus mods won't ever see the light of day on these servers because Bethesda would then have to give up direct control of the worlds filesystem to the players.
---
The only way I see proper free, user-generated mods is either if Bethesda allows for privately hosted servers that we host ourselves or someone reverse-engineers the server code for the game. Though for the latter, they'd have to go underground. No way Bethesda would allow this to happen without challenging law suits and the like.
---
Not mandatory at all.
---
atleast that is what all companies think.  Then they all go there and have to share, and find out that people somehow dont play 5 games at a time on the phone -  that bethesda games loses its value quickly on the phone if there is no main "lore/content" to keep it alive.   But i would gladly that the greedy companies migrate there, because that just shows how much they care about making an actual game.
---
Imagine the amazing things this guy could buy with all the money he wastes.
---
LOLOLOL, Now this is pure gold
---
at this point do you think bethesda can manage to do just about ANYTHING right? They are bethetic.
---
Yeah that was Dubya. What a classic - I have since learned the correct version.
---
There were allegedly some bugs fixed in the latest patch and, to be quite fair, nothing was *taken away* in regards to the First subscription stuff - you won't suddenly have a lesser experience playing the game normally just cause they're trying to sell that. So if you don't care one way or the other about First and you were hoping to see a bug or two squashed, you might be in luck.
---
Not mandatory, if you don't get it you aren't missing anything
---
Almost everyone (except EG and RPS) praises it. Guess I now what I'm gonna buy today.
---
It's like a premium membership with extra benefits.
---
This post will be taken down by a mod. Moron.
---
Exactly!
---
So I only pay this monthly payment if I want this added extra? So it's like if they brought out NW for as a monthly payment?
---
If you never owned the game - why are you here?
---
Only mandatory if you want to play on a private server or want the other bundled goodies locked behind that paywall. Otherwise, totally optional.
---
It‚Äôs 100% a choice. It also doesn‚Äôt provide any real game content other then quality of life improvements similar to those that have been in the previous single player games in the franchise. It‚Äôs biggest pull is private servers.
---
I‚Äôm looking at the store right now and the base game is ¬£14.99 which equates to about 20ish dollars.
---
Was it really worth the effort?
---
Of course it will, doesn‚Äôt reduce the comedy generated by you people supporting a game that‚Äôs doing everything it can to rape you though. The people who can see what Bethesda is doing to you are laughing at you, the time for pity has passed and you have all showed how stupid you are. Open your eyes you idiots.
---
 This is the outfit:
---
https://drive.google.com/open?id=197Rtx1Fe6iXOQCy5iCnd8q91i6YvkxAh
---
There is a helmet with red eyes too.
---
This is what annoys me most about this whole thing.  If money was really what they wanted to make, they very well could have just made riot armor/ranger armor an actual in-game armor with stats the same way outfit armors work in Fallout 4.  Add it into the game to find, or buy the blueprints for.
---
Now, because everybody has access to the item itself and it's not behind a paywall, Bethesda could have just fed people alternative skins of the armor for those that want something a little different.
---
Instead, it's just an excuse that only a few people will ever get, with skins that will probably cost people most of the 'free' Atoms they get every month for their subscription.
---
Hell yeah, somebody from the real world has to give you guys a reality check every so often.
---
&gt; That is way too broad of a statement.  I'm a lead developer for an organization with 400+ developers, not games but that's not important,  most developers absolutely want to create a product people will use and even like, however they most certainly want to be paid and paid very well. Developers are in high demand  and it's a hard job in the first place. None of them would be willing to take a cut in pay, they'd simply go down the street to MS or Amazon or wherever.  My point being they high skill high cost resources.  You either find enough money to pay them or you get a mass exodus.
---
I don't think it's a broad statement, I think it's very  reasonable. I'm talking about how goals are prioritized. If you ask someone why they've taken up their vocation and their primary (not only!) goal is making money, that shows their priorities are improperly aligned. And that's what I'm saying is making people angry about Bethesda and Fallout First; Bethesda is telling their customers, "We care about our profit more than we care about how much you enjoy our product." No customer would be happy to hear that.
---
To help really get across what I'm trying to say, I can ask; since you are a lead developer you likely would have been involved in interviews for hiring new employees, right? And if you asked the question, "Why would you like to work for us?" and they had given the answer, "Because I want to get paid," would that have come across as a good answer?
---
I'm not trying to be that guy and I get why alot of people are annoyed but from my point of view they didn't lie, I don't know if they did it intentionally or not but in the business I work in there's a distinct difference between content and a service, it's like if you commission software from me we'll come to a price and you own that, its yours to do what you like with if you want me to 'host' it that will be an additional fee, even though you've bought the product you're asking for an additional service that costs me resources, I don't know about the rest of what they've said but people keep using that as their argument and it doesn't really stand up, I guess you could argue cosmetics are content they're charging for but they've been around for a while now
---
Different games can have different implementations.
---
Plus all of the DLC and expansions for the game can now be earned ingame through player to player trading via gold.
---
Wow that‚Äôs intuitive. Thanks for that. I don‚Äôt plan on paying to play but I see how and why traders would do that. But again you can trade with people for free.
---
No offense intended, I do the same thing with paradox games by setting strange goals for myself that aren't achievements but just something I feel like doing. You should really check out the mods on FO4 though, there are some good ones. I think a part of my problem with F76 is I spoiled myself on mods, especially the settlement ones.
---
mods in this sub where?,  lmao.
---
Level 237 here, still having a blast.
---
I have friends who still play it daily. I just kind of stopped liking it one day
---
because I can be here, now cry me a river
---
It's an add on where you pay a monthly sub to play the same content you have already paid for and have been playing for the last year. Some people like it, for example I have seen people say the server handles 8 players better than 24, and apparently basic stuff like that is worth paying extra for, some people don't like it, mainly because it splits an already small player base in two, adds requested content begind a paywall and because nothing has really been added since you last paid for it. I'm guessing that was a loaded question though, and that you have already read the comments of both sides prior to posting this.
---
exactly, they are bethetic
---
You can pay 12 dollars monthly or 100 for a year.
---
Let people be pissed. It‚Äôs a natural reaction to the shit show put on by Bethesda. If it affects you that much that you need a time out then you probably need a time out. Peaceful protest never got anyone anything. Sometimes you gotta just fuck shit up you know. You might return to a better game because of it. The not knowing is the fun part
---
Careful you don't cut yourself on all that edge.
---
The thing is.... there is nothing to do that you have not done already.  A private server with 7 buddies.  To do the the same shit pretty much since the game came out.  Its not like they dropped a bunch of stuff to do along with this paywall horseshit.  The bonuses you get are Pay to win big time.  Thats wrong.  Its not survival at all anymore at this point if you pay.  I didnt even give a shit obout the stash limit.  To me it was just another part of surviving.  Same with people stealing your workshops.  If they put as much energy into the rest of the game that they put into the atom store shit would probably be better.  At least fewer bugs.  As far a content, its been a shit show.  Game came out last fucking November.
---
the fact that you paid the monthly subscription lmaoooo
---
I‚Äôm one of them but upvoting because it‚Äôs on point!
---
so brought my popcorn, wanna watch this burn...
---
So what's with all the hatred for it? I understand they lied and said they wouldn't bring out any paid extras but people are so angry about it, they're talking about not playing the game ever again? I mean if it isn't going to change your personal experience why does it matter?
---
&gt; The game didn‚Äôt change at all for those who don‚Äôt want to pay the subscription 
---
You're right. For those who did though the game has become SO much better simply due to the Scrap Box. There is no excuse for paywalling one of the best and most requested QoL features in the game. Keep the private "Worlds" and tent. Keep the half baked cosmetic and the emote. The Scrap Box is the issue.
---
Ok well if you don‚Äôt play it then why be here? Go on subs for games you do play.
---
As in the server load. It allows 8 players in the private servers. The regular servers can handle 24 players, so the private servers have 1/3 of the load. Just going from experience with some other games but servers that have more players are more expensive and require more power. It seems that they aren't running at maximum capacity so that it takes up less resources, is cheaper, and more people can have a server. Which is why I suspect that it doesn't cost them nearly the full 13 dollars to offer the private servers. Thus the rest of the price tag is coming from the free atoms and convenience items.
---
"Dear people who gave us more money for our still bust live service game, what... you expected us to release something that "just works" ? You havent been paying attention, have you."
---
Even their bullshit excuses are half assed. I mean they literally admit their private serves behave the same way as the public servers SO WHY THE FUCK pay for a private server. You incompetent assholes
---
Is this guide addressed to low specs pcs? No problems here: All settings are maxed out and i play in full hd capped at 60.. I get stutters only in big camps placed in Whitespring. i5 9600k stock clocks and GTX 980ti oc.
---
I‚Äôve played since launch. Not a ton but I‚Äôve really taken my time and enjoyed the game. I‚Äôm on the last mission of the main story line. I was gonna do some side missions and level up and farm some more ammo and whatnot before I launch a nuke. But after this week I have absolutely no interest in this game and most likely am done playing it. Going to replay Fallout 4 most likely.
---
The only good point that it still has is that the game itself is a perfect solution for my wobbly kitchen table. It fits perfectly in the gap between the floor and the one table leg that is too short.
---
I thought that most other games if they put in DLCs or whatever that you had to pay for them, why is everyone so annoyed Bethesda have done it?
---
two words, "incompetence" and "greed"
---
The fact that people are paying for the subscription knowing that the game was already buggy LMAO.
---
Are you comparing Fallout 3 Skyrim and Fallout 4 to Fallout 76 because they aren't even in the same ballpark. What the hell are you even talking about they're fixing the bugs? They aren't fixing shit. They are gouging the last few dedicated Fallout fans for every penny that they can get while implementing a game feature that makes all your scrap and time you spent collecting it disappear.
---
Maybe because you have to pay to get private servers,  and the price is kind of high.
---
With only one thing.
---
#greed
---
&gt;Finally, Bethesda admits that allowing friends to join private worlds without gaining permission from the host player is not ideal and should be changed.
---
Now if they would admit the ranger armor should be in the Atom Shop, the scrap box in the base game, and the forward tent behind a quest with possibly some skins in the Atom Shop, and they also implement these changes, then I might get the subscription.
---
Creation club as their "official" mod support.
---
I don't see that as a requirement for being in the sub, but if you show me that it is I definitely will do that.
---
People are getting ahead of themselves here. This is a pretty janky business practice and it puts Bethesda in a pretty bad light, but it's ridiculous calling them worse than Blizzard after that company's clear support of the Chinese government and its total disregard for actual, living human beings. One just makes things in a virtual world less pleasant, the other one supports IRL censorship for a bit of monetary gain.
---
Which Dubya? The one from Texas or Tenseness?
---
Because bethesda haven't added anything. They made a poorly received game and need cash to keep the project afloat, but instead of adding stuff that appeals to people they thought it best to just charge them a monthly fee to do the same things over and over.
---
It‚Äôs the first of its kind. That being a fallout game that you can play with your friends that also enjoy the franchise. And with the 1st subscription it becomes more like its predecessors getting closer to the core fallout experience while maintaining the multiplayer aspect.
---
For high spec mainly and for low spec as well. I have geforce 1070 and intel i7 my game as I show in video runs with 38fps on default settings
---
Well to be fair part of that blame could go to Activision but that's neither here nor there. I'm not saying they're worse than Blizzard/Activision I'm saying that even with that controversy, people are still angrier at bethesda. Mainly because let's be honest blizzards had China's dick down their throats for years and have always been about the bottom line
---
&gt;The fact that each public server instance supports such a low quantity of players to start with is our biggest clue, and making it so that private servers support just a quarter of that means that they can run many more instances on the same host machines.
---
That restriction can be just to make people more intrested in 1st, and not a particularly technical. Altough the server should run much better with less players, but I doubt it would be much more if there could be 16 players.
---
I've played since beta also, personally I still enjoy it despite the bugs and crashes, and I'm actually liking the private server too. Each to their own
---
I may take a few days of leave as well. Outlanders just came out... Chum
---
It‚Äôs not but you are wasting your time with issues that don‚Äôt concern you. It‚Äôs the same concept as if your next door neighbors child got a failing grade on a test. Does it apply to you? Nope. Does it affect your life?Nope. You‚Äôre just repeating things 500 other people have in the past 2 days. The only difference is most of the others actually play the game.
---
Uhh, sorry but every game has issues. Hell, FNV has tons more issues than Fo4, but people would die defending it...
---
Also a developer would defend his product, no matter what. That's normal.
---
But I also agree, that Pete is a douche...
---
The game is fun. But you wouldnt know that because you've never played it. This kind of stuff amazes me. Do you you also talk trash about movies you've never seen? Songs you've never heard? Food you've never ate? You are not qualified to pass judgement on something you have never experienced for yourself. Noone is.
---
You clearly don't play the game, so why the fuck do you pretend to know what's going on other than reading about the most salient thing that confirms your prejudiced bias against the game?
---
Rofl, remember when people were angry with fallout 4? Now it's the one everyone says they're going back to and is now held in high regard. What a joke.
---
Ooooo.... there's a ball pit?
---
Wait...
---
I don't have to pay Atoms to get into it do I?
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=vmh3momQ9cE Someone‚Äôs done a video.
---
No need to go back years ago. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve played fallout 4. Have you seen the scams going on in the shop back in that game? There were gazillion signs of what‚Äôs to come with 76. I think you‚Äôre just too much of a fanboy to know when to stop supporting a corrupt company. And come fucking on now, got more than $60 worth from that piece of junk? What because you put 500 hours in it, that‚Äôs how we measure worth now? I think i could sell you dirt if i make it look pretty enough.
---
Brace yourself, "BeTHesDsha GieF uZ fREeE stuff!! 1!1" kids inbound.
---
Look, I get that you might want to much such a comparison to farm karma but it's not even close.
---
It's as if people forget EA's Star Wars Battlefront 2's loot boxes, that lady with the shit-eating grin trying to spin them as "surprise mechanics" to a government inquiry, the current NBA predatory loot box practices. This stuff with Bethesda is amateur hour relative to this.
---
Not mandatory. No extra content. Just some " useful utilities".
---
who gives a shit though?
---
No junk has a more static meta data. And can be seperated and stacked with ID and number. Which is why food items were not added to this since their meta data has to keep track of current degredation. Incase anyone curious why they skipped one major set of crafting ingredients. We may have a seperate fridge at some point tho.
---
Its 8000 dollars for 80 years. Waah.
---
You have my sword, dextrouspick539
---
Cause people are in need of youtube views.
---
Lol the first ten minutes of outer worlds has more content than 76. Absolute trash game
---
If they don't listen, you people complain.
---
If they do, you people complain.
---
You just wanna complain.
---
I think that's just unfair that even technical support treats people diffrently
---
r/woooosh
---
They are copying the ESO model with it tbh, except with ESO it's cheaper and they put a lot more effort into the content...and it's actually an MMO
---
Nah, there's a massively increased "wackyness" to Fallout 2 that drastically pulls it away from Fallout 1 in terms of design, if you've played it you would absolutely know what I was talking about.
---
&gt;"Also OtW is a spiritual successor to fallout,"
---
Not true, not only does it have almost none of the same writers or designers it only used that as a selling point to draw people in.  If you've watched any gameplay footage it's often stated that it has *much* more in common with Mass Effect than it does Fallout.
---
It sucks knowing there's going to be more cool items locked behind an actual paywall. Previously you could just do in-game content for atoms but now there's going to be VIP crap in this game. Wonder if they are going to make it like ESO and................Blades.
---
Why of course. You're not allowed to lie on the Internet. Why do you think the current president of the U.S. has an impeachment investigation going on? People were able to prove that he lied about something online. Hines will soon follow in those footsteps
---
That's what I mean though, if they hadn't brought them out nobody would have minded that much (they're not critical to the game, it would be better to have them though) but because they have and they want to charge for it everyone is losing their minds. Originally you paid for a game without private servers, why are people just expecting them to be free? I get people are pissed that they're not free but to "never play the game again" is it bit much IMO
---
yep, even has its version of VATs, time dilation, bullet time sort of thing. Once you play it for ten minutes you know its a spiritual successor to fonv, bethesda wouldnt let them make another fallout game, so they made something just as good (in many ways better.. it released bug free)
---
It‚Äôs not true, I was able to get back items lost in v94 and I didn‚Äôt pay for that.
---
‚ÄòI‚Äôm not interested anymore‚Äô well if you don‚Äôt care  about the fallout first rants then why don‚Äôt you just leave? Simple as
---
They sent a ticket and got their stuff fixed. Their tools simply clearly changed over time, and you decided to point it out at this point in time so that it looks like it's related to the fact that those people have FO1st.
---
Others had their character and stuff restored from the Vault94 glitch before, so your thread is completely misleading.
---
You wont even play for the halloween event? There's probably robots to shoot although I expect they will be quite weaker than normal WS bots.
---
I will play. This 1st has not changed anything about the game. Just like people paying for a second account, to which they can dump a ton of things, people paying the montly fee will get some extra space. 
---
Actually the more I think about it, the more Im tempted to get myself also a second char. But I can choose this or that. The game is so incredibly cheap for it's class. It's not real MMO but it has likeness to them.
---
*shudders* Colonial Marines makes 76 look downright stable!
---
Thanks for the video proof. I posted this yesterday after an Xbox user figured it out and posted on my post. The amount of downvotes and people actually saying that‚Äôs it‚Äôs a lie was unreal.  I‚Äôve read what Bethesda have put about it being visual and it‚Äôs still there so why doesn‚Äôt it show when you craft? I submitted a ticket to them over 24 hrs ago now and still no reply. Anyone else had a reply?
---
Ok boomer
---
Whatever losers i have money i buy whatever i want
---
(Am i doing this right?)
---
I really liked the survival aspect. Weapons durability. Limited stash. Limited carry weight. Eating and drinking. Disises.  Everything that makes this game more difficult to play. I know I'm not a normal person. I liked all those things because they gave me this cool fallout survival feeling. My best playthroug was when I didn't use any perk cards which increase damage output and I didn't use any legendary weapons and armors. I wish there were servers like this. Just survival. No legendary. PvP always on. Yes. THE ULTIMATE FALLOUT EXPIRIENCE.
---
well 3 things
---
1) mods are not doing what they need to be doing
---
2) google first the ? you want to ask maybe it has already been asked 1k times.
---
3) you talk about other post, what is your post doing...... wait the exact same thing, bitch about ppl bitch great work buddy, dont want to see them then dont look at them. I can say the samething about your post. it been said 1k times and it hasnt change. what makes you think your post would do anything.
---
Nice bait kid
---
Nop.
---
I agree with you, its just boring, make your mind what you want to do
---
Mods are deleting blatant hate posts and letting others blow of steam. I'd say they are handling this very well things should calm down in three days tops
---
Hmm. Guess I have a spare ‚Ç¨20 to spend one day.
---
Nobody asked you to come back.
---
I don't even own fallout 76, but I get all the news on youtube.  From my point of view, after everything that's been happening with the game up until this point, the people who still followed it up with purchasing the fallout 1st subscription service are the reason the AAA gaming industry is overall crap.  16x the detail... is that even close to accurate nearly a year now since the games release?  Everyone here should know well all the crap that has gone on with this game.  Now, they tell all of you that wastelanders is being delayed to make sure it's the best it can be, acting like they care about the quality of it's release, just to sale you a $100 subscription in which almost everything you get doesn't actually work.  Wastelanders is far from their priority because it isn't going to yield any money.  Making money doesn't require a satisfied customer in their eyes and everyone who keeps buying into the sweet talk.
---
My goal coming here to this reddit honestly was to just see what people are saying about the whole ordeal, and the intent certainly isn't to insult people here.  To say i haven't been the fool myself would be a lie.  Borderlands 3.  It's roughly the same ordeal, though the game so far hasn't been near fallout 76 levels of messed up, the pandering to overly sensitive people, the very terrible story (this i almost always forgive on, more often i'm in for the gameplay anyhow), and i'm worried what all the nerfing of drop rates and builds are leading to.  Not to mention a franchise as popular as borderlands certainly did not need that money from the EGS exclusive deal, but they did so anyways with no regard to how the pc playerbase feels about it.  2K was definitely a company i didn't and don't want to support, but i got grabbed by the prospect of a friend buying the game and revisiting the borderlands fun we had in the past 2 games, i caved.  
---
While i think civil discussion is usually the best option to convey a message, I certainly can't blame people for being toxic to those who admit they purchased this subscription service.  It's quite sickening that their are people still feeding into this scam.
---
Party invite sent, thank you
---
I've put about 200 hrs in. I've got a lvl 129 stealth commando that I love and a lvl 27 melee character that I don't. I've spent many hours crafting deep pocket leathers for newbies. I hate power armor. I was thinking about grinding to get my characters up to 150 and 50 for the legendary upgrades to the special trees. But what I'm doing now is firing up Outer Worlds. The last few weeks have been a massive kick in the teeth for fans of this game. 
---
I can't be bothered to do the full lecture so here's the end of it: "...But the worst thing of all, Bethesda, you've let yourself down."
---
Survival of the fittest does not apply to the civilised.
---
Social Darwinism in this context of Fallout 76, is that Bethesda has burdened the fans with a inferior product, and those who desired a superior product demand change. Those who are considered "inferior" simply give in and accept the inferior product (thus hindering positive progress). (Like the game or not, its undeniable fact that this is the worst quality, deceptive, and unfinished game Bethesda has released).
---
In the usual case of Social Darwinism this would be in politics. If I where to make a comparison, the extradition bill is in similarity to Bethesda. The protesters are in similarity to those who reject Fallout 76, and the HK that accepts and embraces it despite the lowered quality of life, is those that supports Fallout 76.
---
Also "if you object don't spend it" is the most stupid thing anyone can say in this situation. That mentality is the cancer that ruins the gaming industry for the consumer. This mentality is usually a good saying, but this along with not going completely against it is the exact reason the mobile gaming industry is so toxic and anti consumer.
---
if whining is having a low IQ, what iq do you have by supporting this none sense?
---
**Before Fallout 76**  
---
* Bethesda releases buggy mess.  
---
* Fans fix it for free.  
---
* Yay the game is more playable now!    
---
**After Fallout 76**  
---
* Game is dead on arrival.  
---
* Multiple scandals one after another.  
---
* Bethesda has lied on "cosmetic only" transaction promise, as well as "all content will be free" promise.  
---
* **FANS HAVE TO PAY MONEY IN ORDER TO FIX THE GAME**  
---
* The game is still shit.
---
Bad luck. I got one last night, but the noplan chance does seem to increase as you get closer to having all of them, as the other fellow has said. My character with the most plans has had 2-3 noplan runs in a row now which sux, but I'll get them eventually.
---
My prime instigating explosive double barrel slays yo
---
I was kinda still playing. I have barely free time so I left the game for a few weeks/month, then came back three weeks ago. I already got bored tho, and thought I'd left the game since wastelanders was being delayed.
---
Well I guess I'll uninstall it today :)
---
I think they'll give costumes "free" to FF whales a month before they publish the same or a slightly different version for us peasants to buy with atoms. This guarantees most money with least amount of work as anyone who already paid for FF won't even say a thing and even if 30.000 extra people buy the costume from atomic shop thats a win!
---
It's an extension to the game that you don't need but can buy if you want to. So it's not like they've taken anything away from anybody either. If it doesn't appeal to people then they don't have to buy it. I understand people might not agree with it but the messages I've seen are like they're charging you to just play the game
---
Unfortunately we need to wait for that couple more days...
---
Get scammed noobs
---
bethetic softworks
---
Why are you like this? No need to be so angry at everyone. Take a break from constantly reading negative things on the internet and from watching porn so you can balance out your dopamine levels a little bit. You can say what you want back to this, but I genuinely worry for you and hope you at least look into the benefits of nofap for your mental wellbeing. Back to fallout now:
---
&gt;What because you put 500 hours in it, that‚Äôs how we measure worth now? 
---
Actually yes it is. I dont play bethesda games for a crisp and seamless, bug free, polished fps experience. I dont do it for the graphics or the sound. I do it for exploring and looting and the replay value. 
---
I've gotten 600 hours out of the game. I cant say that about 95% of the games I've played. All I have paid them is 60 bucks which is really not a lot of money for that amount of entertainment. I still love the game itself but am choosing to no longer play it for the same reason people dropped blizzard games, I dont support the company behind the game and they crossed a line
---
Mate, what do I change to see creatures and players as far as possible?
---
Thats the only thing that really irks me is everytime something bad happens, all of bethesda just goes full radio silence
---
And my snacks!
---
(I'm on PS4, and not back until Wastelanders but good luck!)
---
See the whole picture.
---
As soon as Bethesda realise that this Fallout First 100$ a Year think works, they will focus most of theire resources to get that Money flowing.
---
Dont think it has a big impact right now? Lets see how that looks in the next Months. People eventually *NEED* to pay up to get the content they deserved to begin with a 60$ price tag.
---
I and many others will refuse to pay 160$ AND have microtransactions for a Game this messy after all this time.
---
It's not really an extension. It's the exact same content with much requested QOL improvements locked behind a fee. If you sign up they are charging you to play the game as you already bought and paid for it. All the missions and events are the same as the game you already bought.
---
It had some bugs here and there but i liked it...
---
Word. These people are blowing it way out of proportion. If you dont like it dont pay for it. Simple as that.
---
Skewing facts to push an agenda only makes it look worse
---
here comes the fan boys with the ( BrAcE YoUrself "BeTHesDA GieF uZ Free StuFF!!! 1!1" KiDS Inbound) 
---
there fixed it for you LMAO
---
Chances are REALLY slim if he/she's on this sub, and that they're sorting by new right now
---
well this is a reddit about 76 so please leave and stop posting toxic and disrespectful things here. you make me sick.
---
I agree when you say they don‚Äôt know what they want this game to be.
---
Possibly yeah. 
---
It's so frustrating when someone asks a question about something then 5 minutes later that post has vanished in to a massive black hole of posts about fallout 1st.
---
There are some new players out there that just want to play the game and have questions it's not fair on those players.
---
What a disappointing comeback.
---
Oh please. Explain then existence of sub called r/fo76FilthyCasuals. Ha ha ha, even here on r/fo76 I've seen already a few times people get pissed off at Bethesda actions already in past, which was very reason why that other sub was made. Make no mistake.  
---
Fact you guys are here still nonetheless after already previous times shit blew up... well. Yeah. That's what makes Bethesda think they're free to pull off that shit.
---
I agree. I am playing games for 20 years and never felt so ripped-off.  Fallout 76 is literally a SCAM. It was designed as a scam, advertised as a scam and released as a scam (not allowing refunds) and now it is turning out to be even worse.
---
I think they crossed the line when they put 10 HP Unstoppable costumes in the atom shop, personally.
---
Praise for something that thousands of individuals across the digital gaming world have found ‚Äúfun‚Äù enough, or ‚Äúworth‚Äù (put your own actionable explanation there) to continue to invest personal time in, and NOTHING monetary after the initial purchase of the game until this point with a expansive/creative component added to the game via use of personal selection and influence of a ‚Äúworld.‚Äù I would say not quite to the degree of when personal vending units were introduced to all, but damn near close. And that‚Äôs just my opinion. Regardless, I stand up for the awesome sauce concepts and implemented ideas Bethesda does per patch. Do you know why? Eager to hear your answer
---
I had literally next to no problems with FO4, i played it without mods for 780 hours and it crashed 3 times i think in that entire time (2 were directly after updates)  
---
After i modded it is when ibstarted experiencing what everyone else was complaining about and i cant help but get the feeling that these people modded the game then decided it was too unstable even though the base game was the most stable fallout ive played
---
&gt;look at this,we used to give shit to fallout for combat and now we praise outer worlds?
---
we did? I've never complained about fallout combat, I actually *prefer* NV combat to fallout 4
---
The point of the game isnt the combat anyways, go play call of duty if you want good gunplay
---
You sure your not working for Todd? XD
---
This is beautiful
---
ohhh that makes sense. Thanks for the info! so at some point youre going to have an empty box.
---
Welp, now its texas reds shot, it's been an honor cowboy, yeehaw.
---
the game is $1-5 on gamepass theres no reason to be patient about it. You are going to miss out entirely on all of the discussion about that game just so you can save... no money at all.
---
Why are you bringing up something so recent? You're not even going to mention how much worse it was when the Unstoppables outfit boost happened? No one wanted to believe me.
---
Lol no I‚Äôm just thankful and see so many things I can learn to hell with communication, actually
---
They want your sandwiches, that's a lot of Bat Faces.
---
That does sound like changes have been made, did people complain that grove was too dark or something?
---
Yeah I get that. That's what I don't understand, if you don't buy it then you're not missing out on anything. So why are people so mad about buying it? Just don't buy it....
---
It looks promising so far.
---
I will wait for a couple of months after release before buying though.
---
Great picture!! Nice with the Big Iron in your hand
---
Like that shit even mattersü§£. I spend double that in a typical weekend. What it boils down to is I'm not so enamored over video games that I let it eat at me.
---
I'm not here to defend Fallout 1st, nor to attack it. You don't have to spend the 100 dollars. The game is still the same
---
You definitely won‚Äôt miss the $8.33 from daddy‚Äôs credit card
---
&gt;This stuff with Bethesda is amateur hour relative to this. 
---
Yea not like Bethesda lied to your face and said 
---
&gt;all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff ‚Äì is going to be free. That‚Äôs important.‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs all auditory comprehension.
---
Nothing is free on gamepass. How can you be this dumb?
---
Yes, in the workbench it has 'No paint' twice, and they both look the same
---
&gt;Most people here aren't even users or players of the game. They only came here to stir shit.
---
Bethesda created the shit, don't blame people for stirring it.
---
Congrats, you discovered the Vault 79 entrance
---
It's still fun to play with friends but I personally wouldn't recommend it to any new players at this point.
---
Of course you are, Bethesda isn't some evil entity from the fires of hell, they made a great game with plenty to warrant a $10 cost. I like to compare prices of luxury non essential goods to coffee and sandwiches with maybe a cake, ¬£7.79... one flat white and a toasted sandwich no cake, gone in 15 minutes. $10 for FO76 many months of entertainment.
---
Just ignore the whining naysayers.
---
Don't circuit to throw me your 2se/je/be before you log off
---
it's funny because they put themselves in a corner. in one hand, they clearly (or so I hope) overlooked just how op infinite storage + private sessions are. on the other, they can't quite nerf a premium subscription model without causing even more of a backlash.
---
so what now? just leave the game broken? probably.
---
Im with you the scrapbox is the largest P2W factor so far.
---
For what it's worth, I have been playing Outer Worlds via XBox Game Pass for PC ($5/month), and I am extremely glad that I tried it this way, because the game is utterly underwhelming so far.
---
It was in this moment, when all hope had faded...that isildur, son of the king, took up his fathers sword!
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to push it higher then what you get by pushing slider in settings
---
how would you shut down your vendor? they still work even without power.. unless you emptied them or deleted them lol
---
But you didn‚Äôt have those cosmetics before? How are you any worse off?
---
Because it's really bad practice and likely to hurt a game we (ignoring trolls) want to succeed. Because it's a slippery slope to further bethesda bullshit. Because already empty servers are likely to be even more dead. Because it's more stuff that you could be able to earn in game that's pay walled. Again, ignoring the trolls, people are pissed because they think this is a detriment to the game.
---
How do  you transfer stuff between your 2 characters?
---
do you use 2 computers? pc/console? can you run it twice on the same computer?
---
The good ol' Reddit hug of death
---
Hello, it does work.  
---
The Strangler paint is not Atomic shop by the way.
---
Yep we should have separate subreddit for fallout general outrage
---
Im just gonna throw this one out there, people generally get mad here because like you said, you played very little of the game, and generally speaking, the people that kick up the biggest fuss at these controversies are the people that never played again after the beta or never brought the game or stopped playing last december.  
---
Quite frankly, most people here are not interested in the opinions of people who dont playbthe game in question because its not the player base speaking its the angry mob that just on everything bad about this game.  
---
Almost every top level comment you see here at the moment is from people who said "glad i never got this blah blah blah"  
---
So the people that have played hundreds or even thousands of hours in game, aka, the people whos opinions on the game actually should be listened to are just drowned out by the youtube hate crown.  
---
Even looking at how much things are upvoted, anything good gets a few hundred upvites, as soon as this game makes another bad move suddenly thousands of upvotes on everything bad peice of news.  So clearly theres people that arent even active on this sub that jump in just to uovote bad news
---
I can't go anywhere I want. It's space and sci fi.. and Obsidian are bigger bastards than Bethesda. Oh oh it's free in the gamestore DUH. Obsiadian got bought up by Microsoft after fans bailed them out in 2012. Fuck this sci fi game. Stop promoting it or start telling us how much social media bullshit advertising like this pays.
---
The ring passed to isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil, forever, but the hearts of men...are easily corrupted.
---
Wish I could say the same. Thinking I'll try borrowing shotgun variations from friends to try various ones out.
---
In other news I'm playing Outer Worlds and it's like Kotor, Mass Effect, Fallout, and Borderlands all blended together into something wonderful. When that kind of game comes out at the same time as Bethesda announcing Fallout 1st, how can anyone not start to wonder wtf Bethesda's been doing with itself?
---
They have to take the scrap box out from behind the paywall or get rid of it.
---
WE NEED THIS. Fuck.
---
This doesn‚Äôt explain at all how someone else paying for a subscription ruins your experience..
---
Dude,  just grab a copy of outer Worlds and be done with 76. I'm not touching another bethesda game until it gets good reviews after launch... so probably never again. We absolutely have to vote with our wallets with these games companies because they do not care about the art of the game,  they only care about making money from manipulating human behavior
---
if I was proven dead wrong I'd start questioning all my assumptions, not just "suspect" I F upped. if I wasn't able to spot something so obvious that other people apparently could, then clearly there's something wrong with my thought process.
---
do you even know how a comeback works?
---
how is my first reply a comeback?
---
your was the comeback, wich I dont need to say anything becuase you already said it yourself.
---
your thought process is just like bethesda ass backwards. 
---
That's real cute.
---
The surprise mechanic BS aside, you do realise that EA is in the Guinness Book of Records for the most downvoted comment in Reddit history?
---
[https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/09/ea-received-a-guinness-world-record-for-most-downvoted-comment-in-reddit-history/](https://www.kotaku.com.au/2019/09/ea-received-a-guinness-world-record-for-most-downvoted-comment-in-reddit-history/)
---
I stand by the amateur hour statement :)
---
Never use bag always look for in world container with unlimited carry weight
---
Yeah, I had troubles with tadpole quests too! About making photos: you have to be sure that in camera's interface shows up a name of what you're taking photo. My problem with this quest was when I went to buy a mod for my backpack it gave me the wrong thing and now my 5 possum badges that I was collecting for a while are gone!
---
I'm not interested in private servers unless they have Nuclear Winter servers and mod support.  That being said I bought a 1 month subscription purely for the cheap atoms and free stuff.
---
People on this sub begged them for a reason to pay more money. Now you've got it.
---
This is what happens when fanboyism takes over
---
Some of us can do both, stop complaining peasant
---
PA isn't sci fi. Flying around in a space ship looking at dif planet is sci fi. Get that dumb shit outta here.
---
Well no it has not gotten more buggy I have no idea where you got that from.
---
I dont get it when people say the explosive shotguns are nerfed.  What hd are people trying to get out of them?  Do they have all 9 stars for shotgun, 3 stars of bloody mess and 5 stars of demolition?  I do and they rock
---
I like to compare everything to pizza, but that just because my ign is angry turtle üòÖ
---
&gt;We will never be able to trust anything they say now.
---
meaning you actually did at one point? because that's your own fault really, for trusting someone who obviously never had your best interests at heart.
---
I was speaking about the community, not Bethesda. specifically about blindly trusting people, actually.
---
Thanks for the tip. Will do
---
That's why you guys should join us at r/FuckFO76 ;)
---
This morning I ate cake.
---
Why did I feel like I had to mention it? I don't know, for the same reason why you felt the need to update us about your economic moves.
---
Welcome to [r/FuckFO76/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FuckFO76/) the place for all who are done with fo76.
---
Can honestly say, it hasn‚Äôt happened to me, and the private worlds are some of the most stable ga roku I have seen from this game.
---
One thing that happened that hasn't been commented on here is the Fallout 1st announcement came just a few days after Bethesda announced that Wastelanders, their biggest update to date (one that took up the entire fall season on their road map initially) that is supposed to address the biggest criticism of this game (no NPCs) and what will essentially make or break the game's reputation and final chance for those that have quit/have not bought the game for that reason, was delayed to Q1 2020.
---
I'll be honest, many of us here expected Wastelanders to get delayed (and honestly hoped it would to iron out the kinks.) But most were especting a delay of a month or two, not to potentially March at the latest. With the announcement of the delay, Betheada did not clarify what new content, if any, we'd be getting in its place for the fall. In the same announcement they said that private servers were coming the following week and would cost money, but did not say how much. Introducing Fallout 1st implies that this is the replacement content, which is not content at all. It's made worse by the fact that the biggest features of Fallout 1st are broken (during the *one time* it really mattered to get an update that was bug free) and that they skipped this week's community update, something they've never done since it began shortly after launch.
---
The game had a HUGE hole to dig itself out of, and around E3 it was getting close. But several missteps and the complete baffling timing of the Fallout 1st announcement (which would have been WAY smoother if it came shortly before Wastelanders and/or with the announcement of replacement content) have just lead many to quit out of frustration. I hope this helps clarify things for you!
---
That thing is so op.
---
I want cake.
---
Apparently they started valuing money over quality. Not sure that is a good strategy. What good is a lot of money without quality games, anyway?
---
'I DID SPEND MY CASH WISELY I AM SO ANGRY RIGHT NOW ARRGH'
---
Sorry that i can‚Äôt help you with whatever was in the bag, unfortunately bags despawn if there is no player nearby
---
That does suck if they are not truly private. If they were truly private then of course they should cost something. All the down votes üòÇ I get a kick out of how butthurt everyone is about a video game. It's a made up story it has no bearing on your life. Why take to the internet just be rude and condescending? ü§®Like people just have to call anyone who enjoys the game or sees value in the service shitty childish names. Like a bunch of pissy ass children. Grow up already. Maybe that's the problem ü§î Honestly I was much more upset about paying 50 bucks for Crazy Taxi when it came out. I played for an hour and broke the disc. But I didn't go around telling people who enjoyed it what a shitty game it is and how they are stupid.
---
exactly. and that would upset a lot of paying customers, creating yet another backlash and possibly prompting legal action.
---
Who doesn't?
---
I guess this subreddit has become more of a place to vent out anger, which imo is still fair, but there should be a flair that reads something like "Rant" or "Venting" to quickly and easily skim through posts and such.
---
Sadly they were glowing bloated ones, we were devastated!
---
Just do another 50 raids and you should be OK. I mean, you will need a therapist after that but you will have the bugged PA...
---
That would work I think
---
If you had said that you bought the subscription cause you love Bethesda and the game no matter what, i would've called it a day and gone "Well, if you enjoy the game that much and still have that much good will towards Bethesda and feel like supporting them no matter what, fair enough". 
---
However, you point out how bullshit this subscription is and decide to support it anyway... and coupled with some of the comments you've made (i sincerely hope you were joking about having to cut on lunch), it leads me to believe you got junkie mentality. This is MMO levels of sub money and, despite recognizing it was a bad idea, you still go for it anyway. Get yourself some help cause that's really messed up, my dude.
---
I hope things work out and you recover everything you (and everyone else) lost due to the subscription bugs but, yeah, that's what you get for supporting Bethesda nowadays, unfortunately.
---
I did Morgantown the other day! It was my first nuke so I had no idea you could do it anywhere, rather than just the queen and whitesprings haha
---
yes! people need to sign in just so they don't answer twice
---
What do you play on?
---
How dare they acknowledge and work of fixing!
---
Money is what Bethesda cares about, i don't think they are too bothered by player satisfaction tbh
---
Serious. People complain about outrage culture, but no one rages harder than gamers over a product they aren't obligated to buy.
---
Sorry I ate it all! &gt;:D
---
I suppose that does make sense, and it explains a lot, like some resources not being there and needing to respawn. But I don't blame people for expecting a private server given the money they pay.
---
The already looted sections seems like that‚Äôs what‚Äôs going on, but I don‚Äôt think it is. We went through whitesprings, verified living mobs, fast traveled away, launched a nuke at whitesprings, went back through, and the glowing ones that spawned in were dead already. No one else had been through our private world in that time.
---
Just logged in and all of my scrap is gone also, I'm on the xbox one, talk about some bullshit, put in a support ticket, i hear they reset your character to a previous save so I'm guessing any progress made after will also get deleted prolly best to not play now till issue is fixed, literally paid bethesda to delete all my shit.
---
The cake is a lie
---
Bald-faced*
---
Video proof or it didn‚Äôt happen
---
True but I doubt enough ppl will get together for legal action just because they make the box free.
---
Noted, thanks.
---
Hm, this subreddit warned my about "RIOT" word in title?
---
Xbox.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt have bought the subscription in the first place. You are part of the problem
---
This is an issue specific to those who have the service, what part of that statement has you think they aren‚Äôt locking support behind a paywall?
---
If they had just left Battle Royale Free to play then who knows. Look at how popular it was during that free weekend!
---
Thanks for making the 274th post on the subject.
---
&gt;Their tools simply clearly changed over time
---
funny how they *still* refuse to restore individual items, then. a few days ago someone lost 2 legendary items because lol, why not. and customer support was just as useless as ever.
---
What is so good avout that mod anyway?  I had it on my xo1 and noved to recon sensor. The red outline is barely visible and serve no porpouse. Better get something usefull like extra perception or recon sensor doesn't it?
---
There's people that still enjoy the game. No need to ruin their fun.
---
Interesting.
---
Maybe we can DDOS you.
---
Because people who actually like the game are playing it instead of wasting their time complaining online
---
Looking at this quote, I do believe they said this for PR, hoping to boost player numbers.
---
Did nothing for the numbers, but they still have to support the servers. So now they found a solution for it instead and...well, *technically* speaking there's no season pass or DLCs. It's just a shitty subscription fee instead.
---
I recommended it to my friend, he bought it for 20¬£ just 5 days ago and he is happy, he said that he wanted it long time ago but after checking reviews he decided to skip it. He‚Äôs not concern about fallout first because fo76 is good and definitely worth more then 20¬£.
---
What "promises" did Bethesda make?  I dont remember them making any promises.  How exactly were you scammed?  Bethesda hasn't scammed anyone.  Did you pay 60 dollars for the "base" game and upset that the premium items arent free?  What are you, 12?!  Do you think maintenance and upkeep of servers doesnt cost anything to the company that runs them?  What about the staff that the companies have to pay to maintain everything.  Fuck paying them right?!  I get it, you are probably young, live off your parents, feel entitled to have everything now, free and your way but it dont work that way homeboy.  I dont care what Bernie Sanders tells you.
---
Legendary rates and spawns are exactly the same. 
---
Listing better performance a hundred times is 1 thing. And it‚Äôs not pay 2 win. Adventure servers become more and more stable every patch. I still have some lag occasionally but it‚Äôs pretty solid overall for an online game.
---
Nice false equivalency there. I don't have to play a game to know it's trash because you can watch a game being played, or did you not know that was a thing? Not watching a movie means you know nothing about it. I know plenty about Fallout 76 without ever having had to play it. I am qualified, as is anyone, to make logical observations. A game that has no NPC's, crappy graphics quality, unpleasant weapons (not all, just many), no story (and no, the audio tapes are NOT a story, that's lore), and a ton of other problems like low storage space in a game that's SIGNIFICANTLY about collecting and storing stuff, need I go on? If I described all of that about any game other than Fallout 76, you'd be like, "Damn that sounds like it's TRASH!" But maybe because you paid for it you feel you have to enjoy it or something but no, that's not how that works. 
---

Also, if you didn't know, in the US, you know how games are rated E for everyone or M for mature? Yeah, those people that rate the games NEVER play them, they watch a presentation / demo prepared by the game developer or publisher, and they can exclude whatever they want from the presentation so it doesn't affect the rating. So yeah, apparently people who don't play OR know much about a game are allowed to pass judgement, but I did far more research than a biased prepared presentation from Bethesda of their game. So yeah, I can judge it all I want, and maybe one day I'll download it and play it for a few days just for the heck of it, but no, I don't have to in order to know a significant amount about the game. Whereas to know anything about the movie you have to, you know, watch it. Which is what I did with the game, I watched it. Do I know how the controls feel or anything like that? No, and that's not what I'm judging.
---
Why are people so salty about me criticising the game, the truth is the game was released long before it was fully ready
---
Reported...enjoy!
---
Yeah, you right.
---
Can you create couple more accounts and keep reposting it at least every 10 minutes? I‚Äôm afraid someone can miss this incredibly important news!
---
Right? Virtual entertainment is just distraction from real living and quality memories. Shit!
---
A delicious lie all the same.
---
Yea, "lost". More like a sripped or dropped like everyone else.
---
ahahah sure let's grind for rare outfits and backpack mods....btw let's collect 7600 scraps of wood and kill +1000 robots with a laser weapon. Fun interesting stuff indeed. Just like the possum/tadpole challenges.
---
You asked a question and I answered it. And now you are getting mad/calling names because I‚Äôm telling you the game runs smoothly and what system I play on lol.
---
Everyone that bought FO76 in the first place is part of the problem.
---
No pre-release reviews.
---
All reviews are bad.
---
Even the company itself didn't want to say what kind of game it was untill release.
---
(Unmodded) Fallout 4 still a broken buggy mess.
---
So many red flags and you guys still bought it, not even talking about people buying the microtransactions.
---
12.99 a month homegirl...ask mom for one of her credit cards and purchase that shit!  Worth it!
---
Just because you don't remember any promises, doesn't mean they weren't made
---
Just one week ago I would have told you that Bethesda would not do such a thing and that you are probably a person who only played and launch and did not look at what progress the game made.
---
I obviously would have been wrong. This is all so sad.
---
I have used that exact argument too but the main problem is most people are actually PC players so they ether can't find it cheap or just have better to play.  
---
i'll keep recommending it but i think defending Bethesda might be out for now
---
Ugh. Doesn‚Äôt all this embedded language and fucking method to communicate on here limit everyone‚Äôs way to comment...to the initial idea or question stated? Hyper focus is encouraged in this format...how am I to remember or see another‚Äôs idea I read 5 minutes ago, when banter is discussed between ANOTHER idea not applicable to the original prompt to respond!!! Makes me sad
---
What promises do you remember?
---
That is garbage if it is just a shut down old public server. I feel for a subscription fee it should be a fully private server. However I do not see this one service being a premium subscription service being a bait and switch seeing as how dlcs and other updates will be made available for free. I don't think a court would see it as a bait and switch. That lawsuit over refunds didnt go over well.
---
&gt;It's still fun to play with friends...  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;...but I personally wouldn't recommend it to any new players at this point 
---
OK, you just don't want anyone else to have fun... I'll get off your grass.
---
Thanks. Lol 500h in and u think u know everything ü§£
---
Is Outer Worlds automatically the best game of all time just because Obsidian made it?
---
No? I'm not talking about you, you've been really chilled and straight forward, but doesn't matter, I'll just have to see what the game is like now
---
Check out the first part of [manyatruenerds]( https://youtu.be/dQd_GXz0OtY) playthrough on YouTube. It's just the first hour of the game so there won't be many spoilers. From what I saw it goes way beyond NV. Only thing is that, it's open areas in a linear story rather than an open world.    Detailed gun stats and effects. Detailed skills(not just give points to speech   but to lie or persuade or intimidate under speech) and skill checks right from the start. A dry dark humor from the early fallout games.  Stealth like far cry or hoz zero dawn. 
---
I think obsidian has a major hit on their hands that will only grow in sales by the (internet) word of mouth.
---
What was the refigerator?
---
I‚Äôm curious if your membership lapses, do you lose the stash box?
---
Ah, pity.
---
We got there in the end!
---
I don't remember dropping my legendary armor as I spawned into a world and pressed control to crouch and R to reload. or a bunch of gunpowder yesterday, as I literally just transferred it to my stash.
---
but more specifically though, customer support said some of the recently lost characters were simply deleted by the user. meaning it's as much of an accident as "scripping or dropping", like you said. yet they still recovered those characters.
---
but what do I know. I don't have the taste of Todd's throbbing member on my mouth. that must change the way you see things.
---
You like to be scammed out of your money?
---
In good faith, recommend them a different fallout game, or different RPG's of a fallout nature that is not this.
---
At the pub? Definitely under $100. When I‚Äôm really dropping cash it‚Äôs the wine bar or cocktail lounge.
---
Like the post says, it was one of those apps where you fill in surveys and get points. I got the ‚Ç¨20 absolutely for free.
---
They are just trying to milk it at this point. Get as much money from it as possible so they can make The Elder Scrolls 6.
---
'you deserve this'
---
Who says they don't concern me? That's an absolute false statement right there. I used to LOVE Bethesda games and I want them to go back to what they used to be. You know when they used EFFORT and took time to make things good and fitting in the universe. Characters, story, diverse choices and side plots and scenery. And every time Bethesda releases a LAZY, and disgustingly greedy piece of sh\*t like Fallout 76 or the Subscription Service for it, when people decide to buy it, that is EXACTLY why Bethesda keeps doing it. 
---
Why EVER go back to trying and using effort and time to make great games when you'll make a sh\*t ton of money off people who don't care if the game is good because you slapped the "Fallout" label on it? That's extremely easy, and it's only when they stop making money from that (which requires people to be informed) that they MIGHT go back to being good. So yeah, Fallout 76 pisses me off even when I don't play it, because when they realize what they can get away with in this, they'll do it in the future Fallout and Elder Scrolls games because why the h\*ll wouldn't they? They only won't if they lose enough money through doing this stupid sh\*t.
---
Funny how all of you people just resort to the same, vulgar, lame joke once you run out of options. Tells a lot about your average IQ.
---
^(Shh, I‚Äôm trying not to humblebrag and appear relatable to the hoi polloi.)
---
People are buying it nothing people say will speak louder to Bethesda than that.
---
I have proven that you're wrong. if anything I'm just taking the mickey in that last sentence.
---
If you still pay Bethesda may god help you..
---
Denial is a hell of a drug.
---
Being 86'd refers to being thrown out or killed.
---
Soon being 76'd will refer to being cheated on, lied to, or scammed.
---
this game had one of the best communities you cuck, blame bethesda for their money policies not the fanbase that is mad.
---
I do some events, exploring and maybe a daily or two, but I mainly log in for daily and weekly Atoms to buy stuff for my Camp. 
---
After all the Atom Shop is the only thing in this game that gets a decent amount of content added. If I didn't love Camp building I would have quit this game long ago.
---
You aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs actually a fun game, and I paid full price on release. Bethesda just hasn‚Äôt been helping it‚Äôs case to prove that whatsoever.
---
Completely empty world?
---
spend it on something worth a shit
---
What do you mean they don‚Äôt count for you? Or that path to enlightenment doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcount‚Äù. I completed both dailies and path yesterday and got rewards at the end.. sure you didn‚Äôt click through the rewards screen accidentally?
---
Nah, you have just proven yourself to be a lowly educated fool.
---
The scrap box will stay, they've had the same feature with elder scrolls Online since launch, their fallout first is a near carbon copy of the ESO system but added your own server. You can cry bitch and moan all you want, reddit users make up about 5% of the player base.
---
FO is a bundle of code that dates all the way back to Morrowind. It's quite likely that there's some weird engine issue that is stopping an easy solution
---
What else can I spend it on, if I don't play any other game at the moment?
---
Money
---
Youre an idiot for supporting this game for so long.
---
The thing I find most maddening is their PR. The self congratulating speeches given at E3 really turn my stomach. they‚Äôve used the good will and fan support they‚Äôve garnered and lied to our faces. In business things go wrong all the time, but Bethesda‚Äôs attitude along with it just shows they have no respect for their loyal fans or customers. I‚Äôd rather them turn into EA without pretending they‚Äôre some small company that cares about the Bethesda ‚Äòfamily‚Äô. Yuck.
---
if there is no future you have nothing to worry about
---
Ooh, phrases I basically started years ago. Let's see how stale you can go
---
Complete with the ubiquitous GoFundMe, up to $552 so far, smh.
---
Played a bit of NW yesterday and I saw some people with NRC outfits. Believe it or not but half of the lobby was around them on 3 games and hitting just them... Some people really have mental issues. Bored people loves drama.
---
Seriously?
---
Actually, its an overstatement because betas wont quit bitching about it
---
Just because you've never encountered a particular bug doesn't mean it doesn't exist, and most of the problems people have with the game aren't just directed at the bugs.
---
Um, yeah
---
Its safe to say.... that Bethesda is just as bad and actually worst then EA, Activision or Ubisoft. Tho im interested oh yee blind fan boy, how could this game actually get worse hahah.
---
Yeah thanks :) that is 100% not the issue here. I've successfully completed this on other characters. I'm taking them correctly, only stopped registering them post patch
---
a better game. the outer worlds just came out, and is included with the xbox games pass which is only $10 a month.
---
Had no idea anyone would solicit an award speech edit...
---
They have said that they were working on the tools so they could fix these problems when it happened
---
you implied the reason why they don't restore individual items isn't because they don't have the tools (or rather the will, really), but because it wasn't an accident and people simply scripped or dropped those items on purpose.
---
well, even in the vault 94 case I think, customer support said the user had simply deleted their characters. **on purpose**. they definitely did say that in a more recent case. meaning, the way they see it, it wasn't an accident.
---
yet they recovered those characters. *meaning* that you're wrong.
---
It facilitates inattention, confusion, and the awareness of timely response to multiple conversations at once. When I‚Äôm in a place where multiple conversations are occurring at once, I get anxious. This is an emotional reaction I feel....Emotions tend to work contraindicative of reason and logic.  
---
I love developing my ability to become more acoustically comfortable listening to multiple speakers at once discussing highly abstract topics. 
---
The problem I have is frustration with the inability to comprehend everything at once listening to everyone. Am I supposed to have the ability to do this? I feel guilty when I can‚Äôt attend to one when another ‚Äúone‚Äù isn‚Äôt even aware I‚Äôm in an auditory conversion with another digital entity. Body language doesn‚Äôt coincide with experiential/sensory experience because it lacks....reliable complimentary senses to assist with highly advanced communication abilities - pragmatics.
---
I thought it was Bugthesta....humm no wonder they never answer lol
---
You think 76 sucked. Imagine it done by the greedy loot box loving, gambling, money hungry fucks at EA/Activision. How about a fallout game that cares Far, FAR more about money than actual story like Activison did with Black Ops 4. Trust me. There are many ways they would fuck up this franchise worse than Bethesda
---
It doesn't have to cost them anything thats the thing, everything can be hosted from host to host(p2p) at only the expense of the owners bandwidth but they're too lazy/ incompetent to do that either.
---
You're a delusional cunt and a prime example of why the games that are released are utter broken trash.
---
You nasty cuck swallower, stop eating AAA dick and listen to the REAL fans.
---
Defending a company that releases broken shit over and over and still nickle and dimes it's already paying customer does NOT mean you're a fan. It means you're mindless drone incapable of having your own thoughts and desperately trying to find acceptance from someone that literally does not care about you or your thoughts but uses and abuses your feeble mind.
---
Issue is they don‚Äôt continue when the owner isn‚Äôt on, it the owner has to leave or can‚Äôt get on, tough shit for you if you didn‚Äôt pay.
---
Thank fuck I hoped out early. Never even completed the main quest.
---
&gt;and much like engineers, they slap something on paper to try and sell in concept.
---
As an engineer, I can safely say that does not describe my job in the slightest. In fact, being compared to Todd insults me heavily
---
You're thinking Pachinko machines, and you're right that it's crazy how much money they generate.
---
&gt;By 1994, the pachinko market in Japan was valued at ¬•30 trillion (nearly $300 billion). As of 2015, Japan's pachinko market generates more gambling revenue than that of Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore combined. 
---
[Wikipedia link] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko)
---
Wait what? So it's not actually a private server then?
---
Does it not bother you that you're paying for features which should be in the base game? I understand that companies have to make money that's a no brainier... but surely there's a better way to make good money instead of draining 76's players of every last penny they have into this still beta version of the game. 
---
People don't mind paying for things in game if they actually enjoy the game! Its a way of supporting your developer but when the developer lies about junk space because of server limitations but then moments later releases an unlimited junk space 'patch' ignoring all of the excuses about the limitations but for money... then its complete fraud! Bethesda have lost all trust from me and i no longer wish to support a developer who lies to its fans/customers.
---
Beep boop praise Bethesda
---
I honestly admire people who are still trying the warn Bethesda and call them out on their actions. You're the personification of that housewife who gets beaten up and thinks that things will one day change.
---
After what they pulled recently, you really think they care about the "beacon of positivity"? Please grow tf up.
---
Nope, it appears to be reused as well, people finding already looted corpses and people on your friends list can join you without invitation or notification
---
I hope it is invisible
---
I get Bugthesda. That makes sense. Bathesda though?
---
I get the sense that they're trying to be clever but they're just embarrassing themselves.
---
So far I haven't spent any money on the game after the initial purchase. 
---
I have been playing this game, since beta, with my mom who enjoys watching and making decisions in the game of where to go and in some cases what to do. I have asked now that the character is 150+ if she wants to take a break until the DLC drops and she wanted to continue. 
---
I have advise both sides of the purchasing Fallout 1st being the good and now long list of buggy issues and we were going to hold off on doing anything at this point until many of the major bugs were fixed. 
---
We will continue playing but still not spending anything on the buggy stuff.
---
I don't think the majority of people do bitch about it though. But sure -- let's split the difference and say a lot of people complain about it. So what..? Are you that easily swayed that vocal noise forms your judgment of a piece of media, so much so that you feel compelled to brand people 'dumb' and 'stupid'..? 
---
I'm not saying you're a sheep, but go browse the [other Fallout 76 reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76FilthyCasuals/) and see how your majority crumbles into radioactive dust. 
---
I mean, come on dude. You are allowed to think for yourself.
---
Why is it not a great game then? What's your issue with the gameplay? Educate me.
---
Because releasing a shitty subscription service is worse than bowing to the whims of a country who‚Äôs quite literally wiping out the uyghur Muslims and silencing its detractors. Give me a fucking break.
---
Bethesda is dead to me. They broke my heart. I feel disgusted for actually feeling excited when the game was announced, disgusted for buying this piece of garbage which is obviously built to do nothing but take money.
---
The game still has bugs that were in the game when it RELEASED! Almost every breaks the game by either introducing more bugs or reintroducing bugs that were fixed before the patch.
---
Their Atom Shop is pure greed, the prices or nothing but disgusting and Bethesda clearly doesn't give a fuck. And when people make suggestions to improve the game, Bethesda tries to sell them in their Atom Shop and now through the Fallout 1st Subscription.
---
I'm done with Fallout 76 (havent played in ages really) and I'm done with Bethesda. I was willing to give them another chance with the next Fallout or Elder Scrolls game but it is clear that those games are just going to end up the same way.
---
Fuck Bethesda.
---
From what you are saying and your experience I would think the same as you. Let me read over and I‚Äôll give you a more detailed response. Thanks for stating what you did because we can discuss and learn from our interpretations of the ‚Äúconcept.‚Äù Thanks bro
---
I did not set they were worse. I said they outshone.
---
Poor answer.
---
Smart move. I‚Äôm pretty bummed about nuclear winter rewards not starting until next week. Seems like it would have made much more sense to open them up now so people have something to do before mischief night
---
The info has been repeated a million times already, so what‚Äôs another post asking the same thing. 
---
From the easy to find bethesda website:
---
...‚ÄùIf you cancel your membership or it expires, you‚Äôll still be able to access any Atoms received as well as the resources stored in your Scrapbox. Cancellation will be effective at the end of your then-current membership term.‚Äù
---
So if you cancel then you can still access the scrap in the scrapbox, but you can‚Äôt add anything to it. 
---
As for the survival tent I‚Äôm pretty sure this can only be used when you have a valid subscription.
---
Brilliant solution. If I thought that way I'd still be playing Morrowind.
---
Beep Boop 'I hate Bethesda'
---
The box will remain in your camp, you'll still have access it, you just can't add anything to it. The tent will no longer be available until you renew.
---
I'm on PC sadly, and I have a ps4, not an xbox
---
I'm just happy to see people come around.  We have to be on the same page with how we're gonna use our wallets in order to get quality games.  I'm so worried about elder scrolls and fallout is dead too me now... I say that with such a heavy heart.
---
It's a whole host of things. I wouldn't get so caught up with the server/lobby thing since it's the whole package that people have taken issue with overall, not just the lack of persistent world on its own.
---
I'm not sure how long term or how money-making this "long term money-making" product is, but I hope you are right about them not pulling this stuff with es6/starfield/future fallouts.
---
Well said. Also a full price release player here.
---
Yes.
---
I feel insulted. There are a lot of other MMOs out there also with a subscription. But what do you get for a subscription for this game? More of that buggy sh\*\*. You pay 100$ per year for what? A scrap box which eats up your scrap...a tent which causes CTDs...a "private" server which is not private at all, because other people from your friendlist can join without permission...in addition, those "private" servers are no new instances when you launch them. They are just re-used worlds. [Bug Roundup Patch 14.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm9q59/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_patch/)
---
EVERY SINGLE ITEM OF THIS PREMIUM SERVICE IS BUGGED. THE WHOLE SUBSCRIPTION IS ONE BIG BUG! When an experienced company is not able to test their "premium" products before selling them, I feel insulted as a customer.
---
I enjoyed the game (I bought an Xbox One when it released at midnight just to play it) but it was riddled with bugs for me; My character would spaz out every time I entered power armour, I‚Äôd get stuck in dialogue more often than not, every time I died it would freeze, every time I shot laser guns i‚Äôd lose frames then all of a sudden spew out a thousand lasers at once, etc etc. 
---
Even recently when I have tried to play the vanilla game, it freezes. 
---
It isn‚Äôt a hardware issue either as I‚Äôve never had any issues with any other games, except Ark but let‚Äôs not talk about that lmao 
---
I have since bought a new Xbox but I wouldn‚Äôt bother installing to test it.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Other than people not liking the basic rpg elements I don‚Äôt remember the game having a bad release at all.
---
Yeah i feel the same. CDPR &gt; Rockstar &gt; bethesda for me. Or at least that's how it used to be. I still have hopes that this was a one-off failed experiment and the true singleplayer games won't be damaged by f76.
---
Excellent idea, what color? the mods could run a pole!
---
So I‚Äôm a bit slow. You can go on a private world by yourself, workshop the shit out of it and then bring everything from the private world to the public world?!
---
http://www.paulonpaul.org/jesus/sayings_1.htm
---
Does anyone know if the subscription Atoms stack monthly if you don't soend them or do they disappear?
---
And yet again, you prove yourself a fool.
---
The user you are talking about made an update, and it showed that his account had actually been compromised, he had actually been hacked and it had nothing to do with V94.
---
You might wanna inform yourself before showing off in public.
---
Also, I didn't imply anything, I just pointed out how mostly it is people's care of attention that makes the items disappear, as it has often been proven afterwards the initial burst of rage in most cases. You drew the conclusion in this regard, not me.
---
there are several issues here. they essentially screwed over both paying and free customers.
---
the premium features are indeed p2w and not p2"convenience". on top of them promising to keep things cosmetic only.
---
but the private worlds aren't really private as they're reused. and the scrap box is bugged and can actually make all your junk go poof.
---
Oh BOB SAGET
---
Not at all, i had alot of fun with the settlement feature, i wish they added some more possibilities with it but at the end i completed every possible quest
---
So people actually bought the subscription, then?
---
Wow..
---
In Pve or Pvp?
---
This games brings out the socialism in about 50% of the user base. It then brings out capitalist values in the other 50 %.
---
I like the way you offered charity in earnest.
---
Yeah it's not a private server but a private instance. The moment you log off, someone else using the private server feature will get your instance and might find enemies you killed, or downscaled enemies if you were lower level than them.
---
Yes, indeed. But, they don't even have plenty of content, for selling a subscription. Actually nothing justify a subscription model. The game in its current state can't justify that for what it has to offer. If was added with wastelanders, I could understand that, but that's not even the case.
---
I hope it does stay. Its the best thing added since NW and vending imo. I'm not really sure why criticizing something equals bitching and moaning to you. Reddit users have a voice, even if its 1% of the players. 1% with a voice is better then 99% without one.
---
üë£
---
Just out of curiosity, I think it's none of your business.
---
Lower it down to 76 cents per year and I will be still mad
---
Yeah, I do remember some bugs. But IMO it wasn‚Äôt any more or less than any Bethesda game before it. But in general I agree, they need way better quality control on their games 
---
I never finished it because I was modding the hell out of it. And once I reached far harbour it would take minutes for the assets and textures to load in.
---
and to Bethesda that makes a difference, how? because in their original response they said they had looked into it and the owner simply deleted their characters, yet they'd restore them.
---
someone also did record his PA getting scrapped without their input.
---
How much are you looking to spend? I've sold a few before for 1k each, and I have just over 30
---
Paid servers effectively means that modding is now paywalled. Mod support was a big topic during and after the game's launch, and nobody ever imagined that it would be monetized.
---
That‚Äôs bullshit my dude I was on that ship for a long time but I‚Äôd rather drown in a sea of shit than stay on that godforsaken ship
---
I love 76 but also I love NV and FO3 (I personally hated 4.it looked great and played smooth but I didn‚Äôt like the setting) but with those games after you beat all quest and side quest there‚Äôs not much to be done. I like this game because it is a constant grind. There‚Äôs always something to do. Even if it‚Äôs nothing important you can still farm mats or legendaries, pvp,NW the list goes on.
---
Did I ever say they wouldn't complain?  Why are you calling me delusional?  I said it wouldn't be pay to win. Which it wouldn't. But people will complain about anything and everything. That has nothing to do with this.
---
About the empty junk boxes. They said in this article, it's a display issue, the junk isn't gone.   
---
[https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-clarifies-fallout-76s-private-server-issu/1100-6470873/](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-clarifies-fallout-76s-private-server-issu/1100-6470873/)
---
I dont pvp, not a multiplayer type, only doing it since fo76 is multiplayer.  So is that what peopleare complaining about?  That shotguns are nerfed for pvp?  Good thing since it doesnt affect me.
---
 Here is just one quote from an interview pre launch, there have been more
---
‚ÄúAll the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,‚Äù explains Hines; ‚Äúall the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That‚Äôs important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there‚Äôs a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we‚Äôre going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you‚Äôre getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I‚Äôm getting that stuff for free. That feels right.‚Äù
---
Anthem is a fuck-up of universal proportions, don't get me wrong. However, the attitude is radically different. EA is at the moment just freaking living Anthem to die. Like literally, there's no mentions of the game anywhere, there are like 10 people watching it on Twitch, EA are actively avoiding mentioning Anthem anywhere in their reports, and the best part probably is that "looking at all the data" (pun intended), it seems like Anthem is following the path of Andromeda to a T. That is, I mean, that it seems pretty likely that in a few months the game's going to be officially abandoned the exact same way Andromeda was.
---
However, Bethesda are NOT abandoning FO76, but they are not making it any better either. Instead, they're squeezing ALL the dimes they can get from their already miniscule fanbase and are actively trying to destroy their own company, you know. The attitude here is not "Let's quietly let it die", like in EA/Bioware/Anthem's case, but "It's slowly dying, so let's squeeze all the money we can from this, no matter how evil we may seem to the consumers". And in my book, that's a far more evil deed than in case of Anthem dude. FAR more evil.
---
that si the problem. People were defending Bethesda for way too long. Here is the result. A dreadful hangover
---
This game has been a PR nightmare no doubt. It's crazy how much can go wrong in a year. Then they pull this like "nah, it'll be fine." lol
---
This game simply brings beggars out of 50% of this player-base, who's expecting free stuff.
---
That "file" you speak of is less than 10kb...
---
&gt; we live in a world where a game company has to make money
---
Do you know how a game company makes money "in this world"? 
---
By designing a good game!! 
---
Rockstar made ONE BILLION DOLLARS with GTA 5 within the first three days of its release. One billion. In three days. These sales figures include just the game inself - no subscriptions, no microtransactions. Then, by implementing a good and interesting service-based online mode, they managed to make an additional 5 billion dollars. How was this possible? Because the core game didn't suck.
---
In contrast, Bethesda's approach with 76 was: create a lot of hype, shit out an unfinished and untested minimum viable product with the lowest effort and then try to make as much money as possible with ridiculously overpriced microtransactions.
---
And now we're supposed to feel sorry for them for not making enough money?
---
I would like to see that.
---
If you don't want to hear anything bad about the game, /r/fo76FilthyCasuals/ is a sub for you.
---
Made my day!!! Now I can continue my comic book lounge/bar
---
bethesda has been going downhill for over a decade.
---
Many people assumed private servers would cost money...
---
Thanks I'm straight on to that
---
Yes as I said.
---
That happens more often than we all like to admit.
---
It‚Äôs okay just remember that their scrap boxes have possibly deleted all their scrap ;)
---
&gt;I stand by the amateur hour statement :)
---
I had to literally quit the game because it has shit servers that keep crashing costing me all my progress. I spent 2 hours in the DMV man.
---
Of course I think the company that now is trying to charge people for what they didn't provide at launch is worse, I paid 80bucks that's way more money than a lootbox.
---
People spell how they say a word so if they say it wrong chances are they spell it wrong
---
Bethesda knows the same truth that all big governments and corporations know. Hold out long enough and the peoples‚Äô collective attention span will fade away.
---
Many have, go to camps in adventure and it seems most have the new Junk Box thing.
---
PA spawns sometimes and not other times.  Doesn't mean it was looted.  Just means you server hopped to an instance it didn't spawn.  I recently went hunting for some specific PA parts and it was pretty clear that all the places PA might be have different chances of actually spawning.
---
Lots
---
Red would be a good color as to show the angry fluster of the posters' checks imo
---
Red feet, if I only knew what that meant.
---
The dlcs are free.  The atomic stuff is cosmetic, except for the junk robot, scrapbox and extra tent.  Those arent necessarily p2w either though, not a big advantage.  Not like its legendary weapons/armor.  It costs money to maintain the game/servers, build dlcs and come upwith new content.  I dont mind paying 12.99 for a game i enjoy.
---
Totally agree with you and I feel your pain man. I grew up with the Fallout series, but today if feel bad for actually supporting this game by getting excited for it when it got announced and pre-ordering it pretty much the same day.
---
I'm done with Bethesda, there is no coming back from this, not for me. You lost my trust and you will never regain that trust in a million years. You have showed us today that the only thing you ware about is taking more money from people eventhough your product is broken.
---
Bethesda broke my heart and I'm done.
---
I'm on PC, I bought a code for ¬£16 UK online, worth it I think to me anyway.
---
Feet as in walking around....you know, like in your way.  I just use the helmet anyways, i dont like the jacket.
---
Friend, there is no problem with you spending money on what you want. I am an AVID hater of Fallout 76, haven't even played it but I studied it extensively because the Fall of The Gaming Industry is a very interesting topic to me. But I definitely recommend people NEVER pre-order and I do my best to logically debate / discuss with people why Fallout 76 (and games like it, including Anthem) are trash and shouldn't be bought, but ultimately I'm not telling someone not to, I'm telling them they shouldn't, and if they do there's no hard feelings, is the way I look at it. Anyone telling you that you CAN'T enjoy a game (even if it's an objectively bad game) is wrong. 
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
Aside from that, I'm sorry your favorite playstyle was locked behind a paywall AND that it's broken after you paid for it. Not cool at all, and I hope you get your stuff back and fixed.
---
https://youtu.be/nJfUP9Sq_aE
---
*ooopsie.*
---
more to the point, you ignored the fact that Bethesda said it wasn't an accident yet they'd restore his characters. going directly against what you said.
---
Whewwww the TRUTH. But fan boys dont want to hear it. Great comment
---
Amen sister!  Preach!
---
Yup, they are nigh unusable in PvP. In PvE... well, you can kill deathclaw with lead pipe if you're persistent enough, so I guess it's ok there.
---
Pete Hines is that slightly overweight middle aged guy who dresses like a 20 year old right? Todd fooled me with his charms years ago but the first time I saw this Pete guy he gave me massive douche vibes.
---
I think this game is like a cult to me. No matter what they do ppl stick around. They charged $60 for a broken ass game full of lies from the pitch, cut the price soon, the bag debacle, the nuka cola debacle, the p2w, the helmet thing and still have the balls to do this after all of that. Ppl shouldn't have been paying a single cent after the third or fourth strike but somehow there's a market for a subscription. It's like a phenomenon
---
Document what they are doing and send it to Microsoft, harassment is against their tos and will get their accounts banned from all services.
---
Most don't check if it's actually accurate, just that your card is billable. You have to pay extra for a hosting company that does that.
---
Lovin Outer Worlds so far!
---
You can always go back if the next ES game is good, but I can guarantee they'll be doubling down as GaaS Singleplayer for ES6 and no modding allowed (cuts into their profits), which means no player based fixes and still buggy, still janky animation and even more simplified RPG elements.
---
The company that created Skyrim is dead...
---
Hey, Bethesda will be tons of help! They'll probably give him 10 atoms to make up for it:) 
---
(Satire)
---
Picking it up as a current player is simpler than diving into it fresh, I'm thinking it would be harder to convince a person of the upsides if they weren't familiar to the game. Much easier to convince people who already have tried it to come back, no?
---
It‚Äôs a shame people don‚Äôt want to support ID because of Bethesda. I was really looking forward to DOOM but i‚Äôm pretty skeptical after what they did to Wolfenstein. Adding micro transactions instead of fixing a rushed game. Machine Games got a lot of flak, but was it them or Bethesda? Was it Bethesda or Zenimax? 
---
Sucks
---
Guys fuck fallout and bethesda. Go buy outer worlds right now. Its fucking perfect. I walked into town wearing armor i looted off a raider and every npc they recognized me and had unique dialogue trees discussing it.
---
now i need to start this off by saying i am not defending beth, but infinite scrap storage and a 2nd fast travel point is hardly P2W in my eyes, in fact i think the scrap box is useless because i never have enough junk.
---
Wel you're the fucking idiot who paid for it
---
I oneshot most things with this thing.  I have my furious ffr fixer and instigating explosive hunting rifle(both primed) to back me up though.
---
I don't have gamepass nor a desire for it. I'm waiting for a steam release and as long as I'm already waiting, I can wait for all the DLC to come out before I buy it. 
---
I have no FOMO when it comes to gaming,  which is why I'm a patient gamer I guess.
---
I mean they didn't lie. It's not a season pass or a dlc. All the sub does really is make an already easy game even easier. So since you can collect resources much faster and farm legendaries much faster it is plausible that it could be called p2w now. But you still can just play the game and get good shit it's just going to take longer.
---
Whether you mind or not has nothing to do with my comment. They made promises and were unable to hold up to them. However you feel about it is up to you, just trying to keep a little reality in this sub
---
It is hard at the moment, posts are scrolling of the bottom of the page pretty quickly.
---
That was the worst justification for bullshit microtransactions in Fo76 I have ever seen.
---
" Let me start this off by saying that I haven't played Fo76 and I really don't plan to..." so let me say your opinion is irrelevant....
---
I would say that's a false equivalency because the thing is, he hates that you have to PAY for the subscription service but loves what they offer. To hate guns, and buy one, means you don't fully hate guns. He doesn't hate what he got, he hates the price (and bugs).
---
Yeah I fully expected it. I still throughly enjoyed the game, the same happened with Skyrim when it released. I‚Äôm just addressing that some people didn‚Äôt have bugs, some had catastrophic amounts. 
---
I think people will be a lot less lenient now though, it used to be an ‚Äòaww Bethesda and their bugs‚Äô type of deal but now they‚Äôve gone all horse armour in our grills
---
thanks!
---
Exactly. With their whole "you guys have shown us with the datas that you \_want\_ this pay to win garbage on the store" they've clearly demonstrated that the ONLY thing they listen to is sales numbers. So when people inevitably give them the subscription fees(Cause some people is dumb) they'll use that data to go "See, proof that you guys \_did\_ want that subscription model on the game you already paid for, told you! If we weren't right all the time, how'd we get all this money?"
---
nope, the email is required to make sure people answer only once, I don't have access to it. it is anonymous.
---
I never saw the fridge as pay-to-win, and all the 'where will it end!!!!' drama was just slippery slope nonsense.  I don't think scrap storage is pay to win, but I \*DO\* think it's about half way down that slippery slope and it now has my full bloody attention for sure.
---
You'd consider paying 100‚Ç¨ over the original 60‚Ç¨ to get the closest, yet still remarkably underwhelming, equivalent to previous Fallout or Elder Scrolls games?
---
60‚Ç¨ alone nets you whole worlds with other games. Wizardry 8 is 9‚Ç¨ on GOG.
---
That's because it's now with gamepass. It wasn't like that a while back. I also paid $90 in the store for imperial edition. When the game first came out it had a mandatory subscription fee to even play. Zenimax said that they did this to not hide any content behind more paywalls then proceeded to lock Imperial race behind a special edition of the game.
---
Some filters of various kinds are blocking it as a scam/risk site hence the archive link
---
 There is an update:
---
&gt;**Update, 11:40 p.m.:** Bethesda Game Studios has continued to investigate the Scrap Box issue and now acknowledges it is more than a menu display problem for a small number of users.  
---
&gt;‚ÄúOur initial investigation indicated that this was a display issue, and that no items had gone missing,‚Äù a Bethesda representative told Polygon. **‚ÄúHowever, we have since found that a small number of players have in fact experienced a loss of scrap items after placing them into the Scrap Box and then loading into a world.**
---
He said why. He does enjoy playing the game. The game is most definitely OBJECTIVELY bad, but people can enjoy bad games. If he enjoys it, that's fine, but I do think people should stay away from buying this stuff otherwise it just enables Bethesda to keep doing lazy, greedy sh\*t like it in the future, but if he enjoys it and is willing to pay then let him do him. I agree I would prefer no one buy it, but I wouldn't want to force people not to buy it or belittle them for buying it. 
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
Thankfully every time Bethesda messes up, at least a single fan stops trusting them. Be it the plastic alcohol bottle, the release of Fallout 76 in itself, or this service, many people stop trusting them and leave. Why it took all the way up to here or there, I don't know. Fallout 76's release was all I needed to see to know Bethesda has become another EA, but if it takes some people longer to figure that out it's just how it is.
---
That's not really earn able in game and no major expansions need to be bought separately in the store outside the game.
---
‚ÄúI basically started‚Äù
---
Sure buddy.
---
destroying your loyal fanbase so you cant sell future content is not basic economics. thats 3rd world corruption economics.
---
But yesterday i learned thats actually whats going on since FO76 is an exit strategy. forgot what its called but some company infested 450 million i believe. so it makes sense to me now. but its still a shame. because it could have been such a good game.
---
Yes! It's a new monthly subscription on top of the base price of the game, but you also forgot about the monthly subscription to Playstation Network or Xbox Live that console people also have to pay, meaning TWO monthly subscriptions plus the base game. Adding even more insult to injury.
---
Perhaps the link being unavailable randomly for random people is just further satirical reflection of Bethesda's own services
---
Nah I just close the shudders
---
I have no idea how to make it look good here..
---
I paid 80$ for the tricentenial and 2 weeks later it was 20 bucks at gamestop. And can we all agree that they need to give the rights to DOOM to a more in tune company before they ruin it any further?
---
I'm not that sure about the domain name though. I'd wage it would be easy for beth/zenimax to claim the domain back on basis of copyright infringement, but yeah the content is satiric and as such is legally protected.
---
People wanted to host their own servers on their own desktops. It's that easy.
---
ohhhhhh my bad. i love when people have contraptions like that. but you cant lock shudders :P 
---
i like the idea tho lmao
---
Yeah definitely
---
Actually some of the external stuff does detract from my enjoyment of the game.  As whilst a game might be okay, knowing that the company you're giving money to is "morally bankrupt", to quote one reviewer, leaves a bad taste in ones mouth.  
---
However, that aside, no the game isn't all that enjoyable.  I love the concept of the Fallout universe, and I love the ability to explore a post apocalyptic environment and see the story attached to it.  I enjoy the exploration aspects, and the crafting aspects, but like most other areas of the game they are buggy as hell.  Upon moving a base, it is still hit and miss as to whether or not the thing will place down again, or whether you have to rebuild from scratch.  
---
However, the game is still as empty an experience as it was before when I put it down last December, with the exception that they have added some scout missions and Vaults.  Literally all the bugs that were there 11 months ago are still there now.  During my time back with the game I had T-posing ghouls, ghouls at Whitesprings sliding along the floor in sleep-pose trying to kill me, invisible enemies.  I had objective light sources coming from nowhere.  I had the bug where mobs instantly regenerate back to full health (after using a flamer on mobs in the Vault raid to try and get the 'kill mobs with a flamer' challenge done), I had server instability issues, I had random crashes, I saw people with the horrible stretched power armour bug, I saw extended sprites... and the list goes on... and on... and on.  
---
If other people are enjoying the game.  Awesome!  Seriously, no sarcasm.  I honestly mean it.  But personally, this game still, 11 months down the line, feels utterly unpolished in every single respect, especially when you have been playing other titles in the time you have been away.  It feels like a copy and paste of other games from their franchise, which in itself isn't that bad when done well, but this hasn't been done well.  
---
And no, I don't expect "perfection in their standards", but what I do expect when I pay someone ¬£60 is not to be testing someones alpha version of a game after being sold the lie that this was a fully polished AAA product (see the numerous press releases and talks they did).  This game could be good, it really could, and Wastelanders might actually manage to finally give the game that should have been on release.  And like I said, I will probably come back and have a shot in another 10 months; as I do love the Fallout universe.  People don't get frustrated by things if they have no investment in them.
---
It pays 1 finished game for ¬£44 which is miles better than FO76's 1 early alpha and a shit tonne of lies for ¬£50 + ¬£100 per year for things they promised for free
---
Pure MMO? It‚Äôs not an MMO period and if we‚Äôre being honest it‚Äôs not even really an MMO-lite.
---
I wonder why he deleted post hmmmüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
They literally have pay to win mtx now lmfao.
---
And what do you mean care? The game is beyond broken, they lied about pretty much everything.
---
Come on man.... open your eyes..
---
So I've never felt like I've been their target audience exactly. Like I have interest in shooters, multiplayer games, cooperative, looters, rpg. But there is just something about their implementation that any time I play their games I just lose interest. Theres nothing in the game that I really have a goal for. I bought 76 because it was multiplayer and I wanted a multiplayer open world cooperative shooter with more than 4-5 players in it. I haven't really played it but I own it. Again I just lose interest.
---
For me everything Bethesda I've played has been a cauldron of mediocrity and it hurts to say that about something I know people spend years working on. As always, I will look at a game in streams, reviews, and through steam community to get a good understanding of every game I get.
---
That is to say under almost all circumstances I won't hold a company's past against them but instead look at their product and buy it. 
---
Fallout 76 has shooting, attribute cards, leveling, an open world, resource gathering, build your own base, and 24 players in a map. I don't consider it the worst thing ever but I would at least hope for improvement going forward.
---
$100 a year can get you 
---
*1) A basic Netflix subscription for a year where you can watch thousands of movies and shows
---
*2) A subscription to Hulu with ads for 1.25 years or a subscription without ads for 8 months
---
*3) PlayStation Plus for 1.5 years, getting access to 100 games
---
*4) Xbox Live for 1.5 years getting access to over 100 games
---
*5) Xbox Gaming Pass for 10 months getting access to over 100 games including just released ones
---
*6) Utomik for 1.25 years, getting access to over 700 games
---
Now we‚Äôll get 2 days of these types of posts. Dull recycled discussions about how we should all shut up and accept Bethesda‚Äôs business practices or go somewhere else. Both are valid on this subreddit. Especially for a new player wondering whether to purchase or not. This problem that was created by Bethesda shouldn‚Äôt be sanitised and neither should your persistent love you have for this game. Whoever has more posts wins
---
Lol sounds like you lost and quit üòÇüòÇ
---
Grrrr, turns out there were no hot singles in my area! I would like to return the viruses, as I am unsatisfied with the content!
---
What do you mean I disconnect the wire and it closes?
---
Until the people that post show proof they can try again üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I don't think new game instances are the same as no content. It's a different way to play with friends.
---
Exactly, thank you. It‚Äôs well deserved that they got a buggy membership
---
I am not blaming the community for the atomic shop prices. The community still pays for plenty of them because people either earn points in game or buy them. Some find certain parts steep, including myself, and others seem not to care. 
---
My gaming history is irrelevant but I will say this is a first for following an online community for a game. 
---
Again, this is not a DLC. This is a premium service. It is not a season pass and does not change the fundamental mechanics from those who pay to those who dont. The scrap box will hopefully be an atomic shop item once the bugs are worked out, and this is no different than the fridge. People dont need either but the QOL with them can be debated within yourself as to if it is worth the purchase. The outfit is no different than those locked behind the atomic shop points bundle and would have been 1200 points anyway as it includes a mask so where is the outrage on the Mechanist outfit? The fast travel point is a moveable bed, stove, scrap box, and stash. Again this could have easily been an atomic shop purchase. 
---
I hope that once this scrap box issue gets fixed it is released for everyone to obtain. I hope if it goes to the atomic shop it is fairly cheap. The private servers were already known to be a paid premium, the other bonuses are honestly a great thank you for paying gesture. 
---
There is really not much left to say. I hope the bonuses are released but everyone knows they would have been atomic shop items anyhow. The argument of no paid DLC or game updates just doesnt stick with me, sorry. I dont view this as a DLC nor an update to mechanics. The bug fixes, balances, and added quest lines have been free. 
---
Take care.
---
It has to do with my comments though, thats why i made them.  Shit changes all the time, you have to move with the times...have you ever said you were going to do something but had to change your mind due to unforseen circumstances?  If bethesda said at the beginning that they were going to do "plan a" but it wasnt working out to their favor so they had to move to "plan b", would you blame them?  I dont, whatever keeps this game afloat im all for.  Commenters here remind me of people bad mouthing the front offices of their favorite sports teams when they arent playing good.  Like they know whats going on in the inside or they could manage the team better.  Come on now.
---
So, instead of giving the possibility to make our own servers they will ask us money so they can rent a server to give us?
---
ohhhhh wow sorry im slow. (and not native english) i thought the shutters of the windows :P
---
Can we be real here? They really don't need to care about reddit posts. They care when people stop buying and playing their games. I garentee tons of people who posted that they aren't going to play the game anymore will be back in a week or a day.
---
Bullshit this sub has a hate relationship with Bethesda they bash every update nothing is ever perfect now if filthy casual got upset then i would be worried the casual player is the ome buying stuff not the elite gamers of this sub
---
What servers? You mean the sessions? lol
---
I need to leave the radial blur to 1 otherwise all water turns to a black flat plane. I thought I might be mods, so I switched them off and still happened. Turned out to be the radil blur
---
Suppose so.. In their understanding this probably means having a "stable connection" :D
---
Unrelated question, what does the tricentennial edition offer extra?
---
And Bethesda steals players ideas and sells them back to them. At least Skyrim together is free.
---
i suppose bethesda's priority is always going to be the private servers
---
Idc
---
The outer worlds came out it's fun i played it for a few hours but it plays like a water downed fallout game in some places my roommates woke up and was watching me play and he asked me what mod i was using for fallout 4
---
Has Bethesda‚Äôs every action not pointed toward continued negativity? I get we are a long way from p2w fridge, but their every move has been pointed in this direction. The only counterargument I can think of is that they openly stated their benevolent intentions, which is no longer very important considering they‚Äôve already broken that word on multiple occasions. The atom shop‚Äôs prices alone should breed outrage, let alone the shifty practices and lies.
---
No, read it again. I'd consider paying for A private server. Not a Fallout 76 server. Another game that provided a good live service &amp; private server in the package. This is not Fallout 76 case for sure.
---
Madness.  They are doing everything wrong.  Sort it out guys.
---
As stated in the comment, " When scrapping weapons Excavator parts disappear from inventory and PA Chasis."
---
It has been a bug which has been around since release, if you just mindlessly spam the scrap button it may switch tab and scrap something in another tab. In this case, he simply scrapped his chassis while spamming the button. Unfortunate, but it just proves me right, it didn't disappear, he simply (unwillingly) scrapped it.
---
Almost as bad as Codsworth's concerned sounding "Siii*iii*r"
---
No. The reason for the delay was probably Starfield.
---
Im here just to ask why do you guys even play this game? Some say the just love the franchise, like fallout 4 isnt giving tons of fun with mods. Why play this game then? I really dont understand how someone would throw 5 bucks to pay for a floor retexture that you got in mod pack for free in fallout 4? Why do you pay for a freaking fridge and not only that but try to justify bethesda for adding this fridge as a paid item. How is any of you capable of paying more than what the game is worth? The game is pretty broken and they havent just done it with this game they did it with fallout too. Bethesda is dead to me since they fucked up my several playthroughs by adding creation club and therefore the "save glitch". Lost all my progress and all my built settlements. I cant forget they made me spend money on their game, waste my time too and fuck me up with their greed.
---
Bbbbbbut what if there were                   2 intefrers
---
Why so angry?
---
Oh no, dont leaveü§ë
---
Well, they wanted to make money like Fornite, PUBG or other games by selling skins and stuff to players, but players didn't buy them, so they had to find a way to make money.
---
I did exactly the same! When i come home a fresh installed outer worlds waits for me on the PC. Gonna be a good time.
---
Anyone who bought this junk of a subscription deserves everything they get.
---
Worked against battlefront 2 and their mtx.
---
It might pay that, but it's gonna cost you credibility, decency, and your moral backbone. I played the game for a year now. Got my moneys worth. Not paying for no god damned server. We can agree on something but not everything.
---
&gt;Why are you on a subreddit for a game you haven't played?
---
The failings of the game are more entertainment to me than the game could ever provide. 
---
&gt;Objectively false.
---
Yet subjectively true :)
---
&gt;loads of shit about modders
---
A. Completely off-topic, a derailment attempt. You were the one who brought up this strawman that I thought modders did more work than Bethesda. 
---
B. People don't say their worth, they let others say it. 
---
C. Strawman #2, I never mentioned they were AAA developers. I never likened them to AAA developers until you did so masquerading as me. You **really** need to be more intellectually honest.
---
of course things don't just disappear. that wouldn't make logical sense. it requires input, either from the server or the player. the point is that it wasn't accidental, he wasn't even in the armor tab. it's entirely Bethesda's fault, and yet they won't recover individual items still.
---
*still* ignoring the other part, though.
---
It offered a couple of skins for shit tier weapons and outfits and 500 atoms.
---
I've just experienced a scorchbeast attack on my workshop and the scorchbeast was invisible, this is the most bugs I have seen in one session since release.
---
Haha wtf? porn? Yea ok good luck child
---
I‚Äôve played the game for a little more than 500 hours but that update broke the camels back, just no desire to play it anymore.
---
And slowly after venting their frustrations people are coming around and will pay for this abomination. Incredible. I'm at loss for words.
---
Everyone is allowed a opinion, especially since it was done in a polite way.
---
Yeah agreed
---
Beacon of positivity
---
*visible confusion*
---
oh no playing a game I enjoy is going cost me credibility, decency, and your moral backbone? how? while Bethesda is losing credibility, decency, and its moral backbone.
---
How much crystal do you need? Tanagers cave has like 12 nodes use excavator power armor and you get like 250
---
Then use google to find solutions to your questions, dumbass.
---
Shhhh
---
Its a secret contest on which shit company has the most fuck ups in a single year!
---
Ya man. There is actually a massive library of games on steam... The problem is not picking too fats. Let them cards simmer and mark stuff. Come back later and see if you have changed your mind.
---
That's the thing though, they constantly break what they do fix and break even more stuff in the process
---
This is where I stand. I don't mind the existance of a subscription service. I don't mind paid cloud-hosted private servers (they are the norm elsewhere). I don't even mind having a subscription model in a game with MTX store, because the subscription provides monthly Atoms.
---
What really pisses me off is having content, important gameplay upgrades locked behind the subscription. First, it's a break of their promise. Second, it makes any non-subscriber feel like second-class player.
---
Yep and this will result in all future games having the same business model as it works the games being good don't matter as they just have to promise one day maybe just maybe they will make it a somewhat complete game.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
The thing is, people are probably still buying skins, camp items and even utility stuff.. it's just that now they (Bethesda, Zenimax and God knows who else) want to make even more money from things player actually want in the game, like private servers, ability to have more storage, more C.A.M.P. budget ect.
---
They've tested the ground by implementing fridges and repair kits, which were successful probably, as people bought them, and now they went further.
---
Yeah i wish they'd get theyre shit together , but its still a videogame
---
Damn companies for wanting to make more money (sarcastic).
---
Oh come on dude. This is a youtuber whose [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-stephens-620939b5) shows that his only background is in finance for a bachelors degree that he hasn't even finished yet and his only other work history is as a home theatre gear salesperson.
---
This is at best a conspiracy theory. Yeah, the Providence thing is interesting but it in of itself is hardly conclusive and old (2015). I mean the dude sites evidence as links in his videos description, of which the latest is 2007 and the others are in the early 1990's. 
---
If you see rumours from a reputable finance/business journalist from a reputable publication publish this, then MAYBE. Not from some youtuber. 
---
It has as much credibility as my saying that Bethesda is on the verge of bankruptcy citing all the lack of obvious effort put into the game and how blatant they are with their monetisation as proof. That's how little I give this credit.
---
sounds like he got a 60 dollar game for 40 dollars...  i think that's a wise spending of his cash lol
---
I think its Zenimax more than Todd but yeah... they are destroying their reputation.  Gonna hit up Outer Worlds tonight :).
---
Let me make something clear I hate paid dlc in all forms on all games as I feel as though it all amounts to explotation of the loyal fans
---
One thing that does frustrate me a little is that almost all game developers and publishers have been doing this for years in one form or another and everyone has been fine with it. Now it seems as though Bethesda is the devil because they are doing it. Worst of all it's not even the first time Bethesda has pumped out paid dlc. People will respond to this by saying but fallout 76 is a buggy mess so why should we pay?  But in my opinion fallout 4 and Oblivion were also buggy messes. Both games in my opinion were awesome and both included paid dlc.
---
You've gotta wake up sometime I guess
---
I sell bulked scrap so having infinite space for it would absolutely be a major in game advantage for me, with that unlimited space I can now ignore inventory management. Don't need to run any of the special cards designed to let you carry more things as now I can dump everything into my stash as the 500lbs of ballistic fibre, plastic, black titanium, flux, etc. Is now easily ignored thsnks to the scrapbox.
---
Not even mentioning the extra fast travel point. That lets me set one at west tek, and one at whitesprings. So now I don't have to spend caps to farm, thus giving me an advantage over farmers who don't pay for it.
---
Well, he replied first off. And second, I never told him directly to stop. I just discussed why companies do stuff like this. 
---
It's not superiority, it's recognizing that microtransactions and predatory business models would stagnate and be unsuccessful if people didn't give into them. 
---
He's an adult. He'll do whatever he wants with his money, and I doubt a stranger on the internet changes that. But if the word doesn't get out about these companies and people never think about it, nothing changes.
---
Amen sister, preach!
---
And so the childish abuse begins.
---
If you have an issue with what I said then feel free to down vote I did make that clear in the post.
---
Brother * üòÇ
---
Ikr, alot of people on this sub reddit vehemently defend Fallout 76 no matter what Bethesda does. It's sad. People like that are the real reason this game has not improved. You can't improved if your game isn't criticized, and thats what some of these braindead troglodytes on this sub don't realize.
---
Theres probably not going to be any cosmetic mods, as the modders cannot use any other outside assets other than what theyve already got in the game, so free quest mods can still exist (hopefully).
---
Bethesda: "Those are convenience glitches"
---
I don't think it's because they want to make money that everyone's upset.. It's because of the way they are doing it.
---
I made a thread a few hours ago about how laggy and unstable the servers are for me since the update and I forgot to mention the rendering issues. Mine aren't as severe as yours on the video, but are still there taking quite some time to fully load, and I think it all come down to how laggy and slow these servers are, as even the audio is shitty as well.
---
It was removed, but not soon enough. I'm spamming it on every social media outlet there is.
---
I uninstalled this game sometime earlier in the year and I haven't looked back since. I am so glad that I had enough common sense to turn my back on this game and the entire franchise in general.
---
Someone posted about how most of you act like battered housewives.. and damn, that must've hurt because it's completely true.
---
Oh.. here's the link again.
---
it just looks bad all around
---
they don't mind milking Obsidian but they can't even be bothered to do it properly
---
IF ONLY I COULD GET BACK THE DOWNVOTES I EARNED
---
Vindicated as fuck.
---
I know man, but ive been trolling complainers all day and sometimes i cant tell whos who.  Youre a good guy though
---
Can you tell me HOW the private servers are P2W? I truly dont see it
---
Poetic. I really wonder how many players will drop just for this awful decisions they made.
---
"Yes, we're going to make you pay a monthly fee to enjoy mods; What, shocked ? Don't you guys have atoms ?"
---
Dedicated servers I think is the term for when a studio has in house servers solely for the purpose of hosting a game, it's actually not all that common and usually a brag that they use dedicated servers, most studios essentially rent server space from a large server farm like Amazon, Google, or Microsoft. Both options have pros and cons
---
No you can join it back as long as its within 25 minutes or something like that you can farm ws nukes as long as the nuke is there
---
What video proof of an empty box
---
I'm genuinely scared what they do with Elder Scrolls....I too enjoyed Skyrim but let's not pretend the core gameplay was good. Their engine is garbage, their combat systems are terrible. Something drastic needs to change over there and fast.
---
Have you played Outer World's yet? That game is everything Fallout 4/ 76 should have been, it's fantastic. Obsidian not only made the best Fallout game but have now made the best RPG of its type, until Cyberpunk no doubt.
---
Thanks for your input mate :)
---
To be fair this sub has been like 90% criticism of the game.
---
Funny as I believe this sub was made because the regular fallout sub hated this game when it came out
---
Because it's fun.
---
I paid $80 for the Tricentennial Edition. :|
---
Then thats fair enough, someone with 500 hours in games opinion natters a lot more than someone with less than 5 hours who hasnt played in a year
---
I haven't really run into that problem. Seeing as this could be client or server side or s mix of both it could be your hard ware. What PS4 do you have?
---
Game over man!
---
Yup, i have today off work, I literally get an alarm for midnight when it unlocked on pc in the UK to get up and play a few hours.
---
So "damn... money in a asshole way"? With no sarcasm this time.
---
All that's fine dude. It's a point of view. Do you have another theory?
---
i agree, but how can you intelligently speak to an issue that you have no experience in?
---
Well wouldn't you be mad about something you just bought, only finding out that it was broken? 
---
And wouldn't you be even more annoyed when you find out that the company which made the product doesn't fix their mistake?
---
Videogames are no exception to this rule
---
"bethesda will fix their mistake in a few monthes"
---
By dropping the price to $85 and giving away a free canvas bag to everyone who buys it (in game bag as we have found out canvas is a rare material and difficult to make real bags with)
---
Skyrim was also a buggy mess and has a paid dlc.
---
if you use the creation kit you don't own the rights to your mod, bethesda does. afaik skse did not use the creation kit at all, skse is completely their own creation.
---
This game has uncertainty and in-house disagreements written all over it. They came up with a concept that the core fan-base were unfamiliar with and have tried to dial it back down to something people can relate with. Private servers seems like BGS's solution for fans who want to play a single player game but on Fallout 76. But it's just not that. It's a multiplayer game first and foremost. What you're effectively doing is buying up the entire map and being the only one in there, or controlling what happens in there. I'd love to know how much it would cost to do that with PUBG talk of the COD's and Battlefield's of this industry.
---
I thought this would be someone defending it but I doubt that could happen
---
actually someone posted a side by side with ESO&gt; its the exact same price and you get the same amount of in-game currency
---
Wrong i liked this game and played it up to this last update but im done with this BS, the ppl playing are either ppl that are completely unaware of whats happening or is low IQ idiots with Stockholm Syndrome.
---
Yesterday my game was nearly unplayable. Stuttering is fucking insane at times and the FPS Drops aren‚Äôt cool.
---
Well, even us here have our limit, and maybe Bethesda crossed it? Blame Bethesda, not us ffs
---
Cod doesnt even have good gunplay but ok
---
Sooooo tired of everyone whining.  About done with this reddit until people stop.
---
Not talking about mods, talking about the fridge, collectron, survival tent, and scrapbox. All were ideas put here long before Bethesda had an idea for them. They even admit in the ITV they got the ideas from the players.
---
So you didn't buy it or play it? Cool. Cheers for taking the time to swing by our sub.
---
How is it not earnable? You play in order to earn enough gold to then find someone who has the crowns available that‚Äôs quite literally earning it through gameplay whether that be trading, crafting or farming. And you can purchase the expansions a year after they‚Äôve dropped which while annoying is a better alternative than the not going into the store at all.
---
What kind of BS theory is this?
---
If by no real servers you mean there isn't a physical server per world, yeah, that's probably the case but players hosting this like a p2p like bittorrent...?
---
You're right that the game only saves periodically and not every second. That much is the case but has nothing to do with where the server is hosted. It's similar to autosave for single player. You're not saving every second for the same reason servers don't - waste of processing and resources and entirely unnecessary for the most part.
---
Might be wise to ask these various social media sources where they evidence/facts are from. Might save having junk information end up on this subreddit. Well, more so than usual anyhow :)
---
This sub was always a bunch of crybabies.
---
An Armor that Bethesda did not really come up with at that....
---
I mean he is given the SC guys money... i would argue that alone makes him have almost nil principles in the first place...
---
I mean SC is like the biggest rip off scheme that is around so far. People literally buy insurance for ships that both dont exist and most likely never will, not even digitally...
---
You know what, points for effort dude.
---
It's still a 'hosted server' - it is not a server running on your local machine, where what you're suggesting would be a factor.
---
Because the fo76 isn't thebonly game with private servers
---
1.)Log-in
---
2.)Do dailies and weekly challenges
---
3.)log-off and hope those atoms have a good use in the future.
---
That's pretty much the game for me at this point.
---
Did me?
---
How many big survival games can you name that dont offer you a local host on PC?
---
The Forest, Rust, Ark, Conan Exiles, even fucking Dont Starve Together allows local hosting...
---
No, you're right. Silence is the best way to communicate to a company that you're displeased with it.
---
Maybe you should take a break from the sub for a few days. You know, save you the frustration of seeing all this angry feelings here.
---
PC has it's own gamepass here: [https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/pc-games](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass/pc-games)
---
&gt; someone also did record his PA getting scrapped without their input. 
---
Also,
---
&gt; of course things don't just disappear. 
---
Who's contradicting himself now?
---
&gt; it requires input, either from the server 
---
I wonder if you guys think about what you write, before posting.
---
&gt; it wasn't accidental 
---
Scrapping your own PA is what I call accidental, regardless of the reason why it happened, which was a bug that has been around since release.
---
Yeah, so tired of all the whinny posts. Same crap, new post every 10 seconds.  And the kicker, tons of the people bitching never played or haven't played in months. Lol
---
What bugs
---
Like you said, we love the franchise. Fallout 4 is only fun for a certain amount of playthroughs with mods, believe me ive downloaded tons of mods to enhance or change the base game. Played hellava lot of Frost and it still got boring after a while of playing. Most of us have beat fo4 multiple times and wanted something new, that something new was fo76. To answer your other statement, I have not spent a dime on Atoms, you get them from challenges and they add up over time and just get the items on sale, so of course I'll "buy" a dark wood floor for my camp with the atoms I earned in-game. Last statement can't really comment on because creation club did nothing for me in the way of fo4 saves being glitched or any of that.
---
Doesn‚Äôt look good in general. I still want a hunters long coat and rangers hat, just need to find the coat.
---
Please leave. The people whining are whining with valid points. I won't even go over it, because it's all over the front page, and quite frankly you aren't worth my time and effort for bullet points. Anyways, what's your excuse for whining?
---
Good to know
---
Who says I'm not playing just because I don't post in here, I played Dark souls for 6 years before even touching that sub. But please just continue to assume &amp; make yourself look dumber.
---
Your hate hardon is rather disturbing may want to speak someone about that. I dropped sarcasm op asked a question &amp; "everyone's just hating go away" WAAAA. As for a sad like yep had cancer &amp; a lot of dead family like a whole lot of other people.
---
I can't say if this is sarcasm or not, but Bethesda sheeps are usually the only ones to put Apple and Tesla sheeps to shame tho...
---
I have a gut feeling this is the case.
---
There's "pay for minor convenience".
---
&gt; They even showed the scrap bot was originally suppose to be in the game before launch now its 5 bucks.
---
Or free.  Personally I paid "free" for my scrap bot.
---
Country roads, they just work.
---
Every sheep has to eventually wake up from their Stockholm Syndrome with FO76 i guess.
---
GTA V is p2p and has no servers.
---
And not to mention the aesthetic is retro western, just like NV.
---
No company will ever have your best interests in mind, it isn't unreasonable to hold them to what they said though on something this blatant.
---
&gt;horse armor
---
Literally cosmetics , how does it affect you?
---
&gt;paid mods
---
For all the shit creation club mods get they are fun and they work and i dont have to worry that the modder will drop support overnight
---
Those first 12 verses are fire.
---
Not impossible, different tiers of the subscription could be introduced at some point in the future.
---
Smh
---
Since they can't make money from selling the game anymore, and they can't charge us for DLCs (as they said in the past, that those will never be under a paywall), they activated a service fee for additional in-game stuff..
---
Private servers mean modding possibility in the future, meaning they can get more money from a FO76 version of a creation club.
---
They look at FO76 as a long-term project, which should of course provide long-term income, so they now want to implement as many monetization mechanics as they can to compensate for a dwindling player base.
---
Never used it myself, but i think nuka grape works like rad away
---
I think the coat looks fine tho
---
Well, if you wont get over it, stop playing the game. No one is forcing you to play or pay anything.
---
This game turned into such a big meme it's hard to believe this isn't on purpose. Right?D: Man I seriously hoped this game would come back because i genuinely enjoyed exploring, building and looting stuff. :(
---
One one hand, if that was the case and the game was moddable, relatively big free, stable and in perfect working order, I think maybe it would be worth it but at a lower cost. Servers need staff and maintenance so it makes sense.
---
On the other hand, it would still be slightly annoying because When Bethesda sold us this product, it was never eluded that it was going to turn into a subscription based service to unlock all the features. 
---
I feel like if Bethesda had of just been honest off the bat, it would have prevented this outcry. I also feel that for the price of the 1st sub and the state of the current game, the price is too high for the amount of features that have been implemented. Not to mention the plethora of issues that are already occurring as reported by the people who purchased it. 
---
If the game was perfecto and moddable, I would certainly be paying for it because it would be clear by then that Bethesda is doing the work they need to do to earn my money.
---
People are stupid. Don't worry about it.
---
acting like the grammar police and using the power of semantics won't change the fact that you're wrong: Bethesda does not restore lost, individual items. why they "vanish" however you might interpret that is irrelevant. but more often than not it's Bethesda's fault, which adds insult to injury.
---
**still** ignoring the rest. does admitting that you're wrong hurts that bad?
---
Awww, paying it forward mate :)
---
Yep. I'm not going to lie this fallout 1st has left a bad taste in my mouth. I have been holding out, that the game will finally come into it's own. I'm not surprised but really disappointed about how they have gone about everything.
---
Brahmin Milk reduces rads but it can spoil
---
But the problem is we can't, and shouldn't, force people not to buy crap. The People have to be smart enough to just not buy crap. Games have ALWAYS been one of my favorite mediums of escape and entertainment since I was a kid, and the Downfall of The Gaming Industry (Fallout 76 being a highlight of it) is one of the saddest but most interesting things I've seen. How greed can just skyrocket and create so much terrible backwards logic is ridiculous. 
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
To compare Bethesda to Anakin when he had his fall to the Dark Side in Star Wars (the Novel version of Episode 3 goes into far more detail about it!) some people thought it didn't seem like him or fit his character to kill the kids, but the thing is he did not WANT to, he wanted to save Padme, and thought the Dark Side abilities were the only way to do that. He also did think the Jedi were evil for so many of their mistakes throughout the Clone Wars, but even on his way to the chamber with the Younglings, he was wondering if he could even do it, ignite his saber to strike them, and thinking about it he thought if he didn't, they'd just be orphans, belonging to no where, having no purpose, so he thought of it as a mercy killing, and blamed the Jedi for brainwashing the younglings with their teachings which made him have to do it. 
---
Anakin's greed was for Padme (finding her more important than anyone or anything) which caused some twisted backwards logic so he could justify killing kids and blaming others for his actions. 
---
Bethesda's greed is for money (finding it more important than anyone or anything) which caused some twisted backwards logic so they could justify selling a crap subscription service to a crap unfinished game.
---
On the main menu if click 'more info' it says that.
---
true, but they are the ones that are screwing it up with the digital non persistent private instanced worlds/"servers"
---
Nuka Grape -400 rads
---
How's the coat bad?
---
it's not as if those are revolutionary ideas, i don't see anything wrong with players suggesting things they want (within reason) and the game dev adding those things (within reason). you can, but most don't.
---
i haven't. no worries.
---
Aww cheers mate :)
---
No I just usually ignore fools, no purpose in trying to lower to their ground to discuss, they would simply beat me in their own habitat.
---
 I think a comparison is in order! It'll paint a clear picture of Bethesda.

Even the mtx bs is not that bad if beth adds an outfit to the game i can buy it straight ahead if valve adds a hat i have to gamble
---
Personally just the pricing.. For 5‚Ç¨/month i would have bought one for me and one for my gf. 6-10‚Ç¨/month i would have sighed and bought two. But at the current pricing i will play without until the price drops (which i expect to happen after xmas).
---
Secondly for the bad quality of the update and the bad PR they are doing.
---
Assuming they reading this and not plotting the next evil scheme while twisting the evil mustaches! While God Howard laugh histaricly!
---
but wait, you have said the samething in a few post that I have seen so then what that makes you.
---
it is. precisely because they'll never have your best interests in mind. they'll say whatever to peddle their product.
---
Sooooo tired of ignorant people willing to pay for broken crap that allows companies to continue selling broken crap.
---
Ahh. Ok. Well. Poop.
---
The point is all those things are being sold back to the players. As I said at least with Skyrim together it is free.
---
People like you are the reason they continue to shit on us. Thanks
---
Did you donate all your scrap and legendaries?
---
Well they said it last year, I knew at least
---
The most disappointing thing is the lack of response from Bethesda.
---
You have no idea how game engines work
---
See you in a week.
---
That's why I made this post. To tty to understand more and why. Private servers costing money isn't a problem imo, but from what people here have been saying, it sounds like they're not actually private servers. That is wrong.
---
The difference is that when a piece of shit Human abuses their partner, there isn't thousands of people and YouTubers trying to help them get out of the situation. 
---
I know you you're using an easy comparison and I've seen Youtubers do the same thing but it's super disrespectful to people in actual abusive relationships that don't have support. 
---
Still fuck Bethesda though.
---
Honestly anyone who actually bought the subscription deserves to be ripped off at this point.
---
*they had us in the first half not gonna lie* I'd give  a medal for effort if I could
---
Friend, why do you take Bethesda's crap? It's fine if you love the game, it's fine if you pay or don't pay for things you like, but don't you at least agree it SHOULD be free? Especially with how bad the game was at launch and still is? Enjoying the game doesn't mean it isn't bad, it's fine to enjoy anything, but come on man, don't you see how they're using people like you so they can be lazy and not make much worth while? They even literally use community feedback to figure out what they can sell back to people. Why do you defend them, friend?
---
I already "beat" you, twice now. you've been proven wrong. twice.
---
- Bethesda does not recover individual items, they say as much in automated responses
---
- Bethesda said the characters were deleted on purpose but still recovered them, going directly against what you said
---
not rocket science.
---
You‚Äôre*
---
No ones acting like someone fucked their wife. They‚Äôre acting like they were lied to and disrespected. No ones hunting down Bethesda employees or wishing death upon them, they‚Äôre venting on a forum, which ironically is exactly what you‚Äôre doing.
---
I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs the reviewers and majority of the community‚Äôs opinion judging by reviews ;)
---
Congratulations on being just another sheep idiot but in a different herd
---
Yes well every posts doesn't need to be "im quiting the game" like if your gonna leave just go
---
If you thought this game would end up well and Bethesda would get its shit together somehow you clearly haven't been paying attention in the past few months.
---
that's not an argument.
---
This is a complete utterly ridiculous joke!
---
 Bethesda used to be my favorite number 1 game company but with all this in game store purchases and all these STUPID limitations in their games! They are now towards the bottom.
---
This is not private servers! Not even close to what we want!
---
 Private servers are where we have control over many settings that we can adjust to our liking. Invite who we want and not have it shut down if we're not playing.
---
Another idiotic response I see. I will make it short and sweet and simple enough for you to understand. They lied about the stash space. They said we couldn't get unlimited junk because it will cause the servers to crash. Suddenly that feature is behind a paywall. As more and more features get requested to the game, they will start putting those behind a paywall if said paywall makes them enough money. It turn, those idiots who bought the subscription ACTUALLY are affecting those people who didn't.
---
Their*, Jesus man. This is primary school grammar.
---
I misread then... they are not a private server more of a digital instance which i think is pissing people off more.
---
What sucks is that most people here, myself included, really liked the idea of an Online Fallout game. But this game is obviously just a way for Zenimax to make money during a dry period where they don't have much coming out, after having had a number of commercial flops like Wolfenstein Young Blood.
---
I don't know that I can even blame Bethesda for this, I think Bethesda is a victim of being owned by a publisher that's expectations for profit are rising higher and higher due to a history of successful releases like Doom, Skyrim, Fallout. So they push the games as a service model to mimick other industry giants in the gulf between their major releases. 
---
This is what happens when people buy microtransactions and justify it by saying 'oh they're only cosmetic', before you know it the whole industry is shifting the goal post to normalise this stuff. And generally speaking the consumer is 100% to blame. Tis sad.
---
Outer worlds is included in game pass as well..
---
The asspulls these fanboys are willing to do to defend the predatory practices of bethesda
---
Well yeah but Skyrim was a hit on consoles for a long time before modding there was a thing, same for Fallout4, my point stands that people just genuenly enjoy this games as they are, without modding.
---
Hell I play on PC and I barely mod my bethesda games (I have only modded morrowind).
---
Nah dawg
---
Smh ZOS aint Bethesda 2 whole diffrent companies witch means Bethesda dont run ESO ZOS does get over yrself. You really enjoy showing your lack of knowing facts before Ranting.
---
Lol.
---
And people pay singleplayer games.
---
Lmaoooxdxdx
---
Shouldn't you be dropping out of this sub too?
---
But sure, bye, it was nice knowing you
---
I‚Äôm just playing a game I enjoy, lol. You should try it.
---
Thanks Todd, very cool!
---
Did you share your legendarys? I would do that if I quit.
---
Hey is that sheep simulator? I used to play that on Nintendo back in the day
---
I‚Äôve heard people saying that they were opening a private world and finding dead NPCs and items that should be there like PA that have been looted. So basically people are being thrown into abandoned worlds for one. Also people were being randomly joined by others on their friends list who clicked ‚Äújoin‚Äù on their gamertag so that‚Äôs a huge issue for traders who often have a lot of people on their list. At the moment it doesn‚Äôt sound like it‚Äôs fully locked off and private which is a shame for people who want the single player experience or don‚Äôt want to be pestered by trolls. And man, can we have some game rules? It‚Äôs a classic thing for most private servers to be able to manipulate the game rules for a private session.
---
This is gold!
---
Fallout 76 fans who buy this have something called beaten wife syndrome.
---
Looks like its live again, probably server couldn't handle so much traffic but it works now.
---
It's just pictures of angry fanboys, that's what I hear
---
Do you mean reddit? üòâ
---
Nuka Grape would be my first go-to besides radaway. If you use the Perk "Cola Nut" you will get -1200 rads.
---
Thats pretty rad!
---
Could be because the game was basically 15$ two weeks after launch.
---
But that doesn't mean that same people who bought the game stick with it. That's why we look at player counts.
---
Companies don't care about you. They're not people. They exist to make money.
---
If ur under lvl 40 and dont have starch geans maxed then ya use nuka grape. But over lvl 40 with max starch geans then used diluted radway.
---
And people say there's no reason to keep playing this game
---
Repeating machine gun sound isn't fixed globally. I had it happen yesterday in Arcos pharma (or whatever it's called)
---
I mean, I enjoyed Fallout 4 and Skyrim and all the previous games in both of those series. I'm not going to boycott them over a flop. What I am going to do is wait a week or two to see what people think before I buy the next Fallout or Elder Scrolls game.
---
&gt; All that's fine dude. It's a point of view. 
---
You say this as if all points of view should be respected. My point is the point of view presented isn't really worth all that much based on the "expertise" of the person presenting it and the sources they use.
---
Unless I'm mistaken (it's been a little while since I've seen that video), that 2015 providence exit strategy thing is the only worthwhile evidence that everything is pivoting off, right? That's the most recent "evidence" to date (and I use that term loosely)?
---
Isn't it interesting that no one else is really reporting on this that aren't using Luke Stephens as the central reference? Who in the finance industry wouldn't love to hear about someone as large and well established as Zenimax and Bethesda Softworks potentially going public and yet it's mostly radio silence, right?
---
I mean I'm very much open to changing my perspective on the matter but I just can't seem to come across any solid evidence. 4 years between signally potential sale of stake/IPO and nothing since doesn't bode well for us being on the verge of a BGS selloff, right?
---
Present evidence more credible than Luke Stephens and we can have a conversation.
---
As for a theory, I don't really have my own. It really doesn't matter that much to me as to the reasons for Bethesda run of greed. Bear in mind some people would say it started back with Oblivion with the ridiculously overpriced horse armour. This was WELL before providence stepped in.
---
I just thought of a theory right now as I'm typing this. Bethesda almost went bankrupt with Morrowwind, which saved the studio. Maybe they hate that feeling of being nearly bankrupt and are doing all of this monetisation to avoid that.
---
Once again, I'm just a dude with no background in this area. I would pay this as much credit as it warrants.
---
Can we stop with the "sc is a scam" i bet you didn't even play the damn thing... (yes you can play it... there are bugs but that's what a pre-alpha is for) 
---
The game is stunning and if it was a scam it is a poorly executed one (why didn't they run off with 300 Million ?) The game is costly and it shows.
---
Why was the post deleted?
---
I think $5/mo just for the private worlds is fair and maybe $10 if you could mod them. If you buy atoms its worth it as is imo but I don't.
---
and it actually runs
---
Oh a subscription for the game for storage space that everyone asked for behind a paywall now?:) I'll just go ahead and free up some storage space on my hard drive. As in I'm deleting fallout to install something fun in its place. This was  the last straw for me, I'm done waiting on this game to be actually good.
---
Haven't played for a couple of weeks. Think it's the end of the line for me. A kick in the teeth for those not yet bored with the game though.
---
Sleazy? Yes I think but not really P2W in my eyes just pay for QoL.
---
well, no radio silence on the new revenue stream problems anyway.
---
Meh. I‚Äôll be happy to play with settings, I but I feel as though that‚Äôll give even more of an advantage to us 1st players if we can bump up spawns. I‚Äôm already making 3 or so levels an hour by fast travelling between places like west tek and cleaning them out and I‚Äôm over level 300.
---
They have followed this bible [here](https://www.tuw.edu/psychology/psychology-behind-microtransactions/)
---
For console there is really no other game to play that offers anything close this :)
---
Pretty much, yeah.
---
I suppose this whole thing could have gone less chaotic, had they just introduced multiple options for private server creation, and also NOT include game-enhancing mechanics into the paid subscription.
---
They could've allowed players to host private servers for free themselves, loading player's system instead of Amazon servers, which would mean that as soon as host leaves, the server disbands (strangely enough, it's how this thing works right now).
---
And at the same time they could have introduced paid versions for 5$ (standard, for max 5 people) per month, for example.. which would provide "stability" and also continuity of play sessions for those who have the access to said private server. Or for 10$ if you want to stack the server full of your friends.
---
The only simple example I can provide is a Microsoft's implantation for Minecraft servers: free if you host yourself... paid if it's on their server.
---
I'll take Whattaboutism for $500.
---
Posting dumb shit is your game of choice? Thats rough
---
Except you should be mad about the subscription service too
---
Welcome to the bottom of the slope.  I've been here since 2013.
---
2.5 minutes to render whitesprings front gate....gig speed
---
Tried and nuke whitespring on someones private servers. First spawn was dead and there where no other people on the server
---
Wtf do you have 400 lbs of scrap?
---
The problems with emergency supply drops around the monorail elevator are not new. They happen because the drone collides with the monorail superstructure or the mountains during its approach, which interrupts its descent path. So it tries again, collides again, lather, rinse, repeat.
---
Beacon of posi.... *positive happy fans?* Wow. You've been reading a different subreddit than I. 
---
I remember a sub where literally everything was met with outcry. Fury about lack of NPC's, fury about bugs, fury about explosive weapons being OP, fury over explosive weapons being nerfed, and on and on. Do you really think they pay attention to this sub at this point? 
---
All I know is, I logged on today and saw a *lot* of scrap boxes. I'd say maybe a third of the camps I visited. Fairly sure this sub is a vocal minority by now.
---
you mean the people who take 1 year to make 5 minutes edits in the CK? having access to the source?
---
Logged in last night to check the daily challenges and see if there were any easy atoms. I saw "Kill a Sheepsquatch" and then got a notification for Free Range, no problem!  Five or six other people between level 16 and 275 showed up and one dude starts doing the robot while wearing his ranger outfit.
---
:[
---
I always close doors because it was irritating that nobody ever closed mine. I finally just deleted my door and put up bone chimes which everyone disarmed. Lol
---
That‚Äôs where I have moved too. It seems like 75% of posts here are people beating the same dead horse. Everyone knows a portion of the players are unhappy about it but killing the vibe for everyone else seems unnecessary.
---
Is not his system is poor game optimization.
---
You haven‚Äôt really left unless you announce it with a certain amount of attention seeking hysterical fan fare.
---
He is a douche, but it's kind of job.
---
A hat, a suit and an emote iirc. Possibly some weapon skins. All American flag themed.
---
The coat could use a little more detail on the chest but overall it's fine. I do think the gas mask part of the helmet looks abit squashed in.
---
Desperate times call for desperate means I guess
---
They host their servers in the Amazon cloud (AWS) which scales up and down as needed.
---
True.. No silence on priority items. :) "Rest will die down in a week or two" - I guess this is their mindset right now.
---
I love how you people assume anyone with disposable income is living off their parents.  No, it's called being an adult and spending my money how I see fit.
---
Want me to assume now?.
---
I assume since you have such an issue with how other people spend **their** money that you work a minimum wage dead end job, have no prospects and would rather spend your time bitching about income equality instead of bettering yourself and earning that bigger paycheck.
---
I have that edition, and I don't think I got any of those. Hmmm...
---
See you later
---
Yea...... what a sad decision they made. I really did wait for them to make this game what it should be, I really hope the rest of Bethesda‚Äôs team won‚Äôt operate like this in the future.
---
You know you're awfully pessimistic for someone with your username.
---
The metal is too dark, especially on the helmet, that's for sure.
---
Things that suck:
---
A) Exclusivity of the non-cosmetic items. The base versions of these things should be available to all players. 
---
B) Forcing a high price by forcing you to buy atoms.
---
C) Private servers not being real (permanent) private servers. 
---
A monthly subscription is not a terrible idea, neither are some perks for having it, if it means that content upgrades aren't hidden behind DLCs. It's how most MMOs run since a decade. But, and this is a big one, for 15$ you can buy a subscription for any of those games and end up having way more bang for your buck, even if you're at the mythical endgame. Here, there's not really anything that is *worth* the 15$ - and nor should there.
---
;( It was removed.
---
Someone who plays and knows that you don't need 400 lbs of junk in your stash.
---
I do agree overall
---
They will, now that they have seen they can milk their players shamelessly, and many will still defend them for some reason.
---
*3 months pass by*
---
 "Hmm, let's see what the deal with Fallout 76 is now..." 
---
 "Nope. It's worse."
---
Seems like you don‚Äôt know the facts either.
---
Zenimax owns Bethesda Game Studios (Developer) and Bethesda Softworks (Publisher).
---
&gt; And now you're adding in a subscription service for 100$ a year and it DOSN'T EVEN WORK!? 
---
It does work, I paid the $99 for it, and I actually like it.
---
Err you may have to craft them at a clothing bench. Probably under "outfits". The emote is probably in the store emote section and needs assigning. Sorry I am vague, I dont have the collector's edition
---
I agree, imagine if companies had to actually stand behind their games or face lawsuit. Maybe they would think twice about half assing their games and actually finishing games instead of charging dlcs for everything from texture packs, an extra 20 mins of game play or a new gun. Let's hold these companies responsible, they make millions rip off their employees and now their player base.
---
Mmm I guess we will see in a year in what star field has, I‚Äôm just going to write off this game I guess E3 2020 I await.
---
I don't really understand what any of you expected, or why you feel so hurt. Of course they lied to you, they want to make money. These corporations don't care about you, they're not your friends, and they'll renege on promises and lie through their teeth to get the job done.
---
Honestly, it's like none of you have dealt with the AAA industry before. The naivety is palpable.
---
[check this guy out](https://www.reddit.com/u/yipyipyipyip_4/) all he seems to do is bitch and moan about shit he don‚Äôt like, and judging by his karma it seems not many people agree with him.  Inspirational.
---
Exactly the these ppl feed Bethesda greed its like a addicted person feeding money to a dealer so he can commit more crimes. If you feed the disease you are part of the problem its that simple.
---
Ug.  I've used it 3 times since I dropped the atoms for it.  Shame on me.
---
OP coming out threatening them as if they care about a Reddit post is hilarious. No one here will remember this post in an hour after seeing it, why should Bethesda take it serious?
---
I think I figured it out ( I edited the comment). Also, I've looked at the workbench before, no America themed items.
---
It's a little dark I do notice that
---
"**Science fiction** (sometimes called **Sci**\-Fi or simply SF) is a genre of speculative fiction that typically deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such ***as advanced science and technology***, time travel, parallel universes, fictional worlds, space exploration, and extraterrestrial life"
---
Fallout has imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, takes place in a fictional world based on 1950s retro futuristic science, it takes place in a parallel universe where humanity didn't have a cold war and focused on the application of nuclear sciences, has aliens, and also has space ships such as Mothership Zeta, or the Hubologist's ESS Quetzel. The evidence is there, you can choose to accept it or wallow in your own self ignorance, but don't drag anyone down with you.
---
I've defended this game too much too. O wish I would have paid more attention. I didn't buy a lot of stuff, but I ignored it and see why it's just as bad.
---
‚ÄúI rEfUsE tO pAy tHaT mUcH fOr A sCrAp BiN‚Äù
---
Glad you got it sorted.
---
They vent and then they get over it. It happens with every unpopular decision made by game developers ever. Two weeks from now those people will likely still be playing and have stopped complaining.
---
No point complaining about complainers. Let them vent without interference, you complaining about it is just hypocritical and encourages them.
---
I came here for a wall of text only to find no aforementioned wall. What gives man.
---
I have the opposite.
---
People using the puking emote in front of me in NW
---
I recommend Morrowind, which I consider vastly superior to Skyrim. For extra effect, absolutely ignore any strategy guides and play the game clean.
---
They should of as the game would be in a better state as they create alot of MMO's but wait there already working on a new MMO idk when the realease date is. Seen a few previews and it looks alot like ESO but with better graphics and faster game play.
---
It's not disrespectful, it's literally what is happening. We don't have thousands of people helping get out of the situation, we have thousands of keyboard warriors that can be safely ignored because no matter how much they bitch and moan Bethesda is still selling these subscriptions to people.
---
Yes little trolls like yourself call me a shill without ever addressing my arguments.  How I wish I could live in your simple 5 year old world were anyone that disagrees with me is automatically a shill. 
---
But by all means regale me on why the Yes Men isn't a faction even though they tick all the game play and narrative boxes as all the other factions in NV. I need a good laugh.
---
Fuck i was gonna say that. It's time i turned this off for the day, seems like you got this

LOL who is crying?  i see more people floored at how dumb people are and how easy it is to bleed peoples wallets these days.   Suckers **ALWAYS** make the best targets

Pro-tip, dont knock something because it's a conspiracy theory.

---
Well, for me, it's mods that keep me going back to Skyrim. 
---
Which, as we should all remember, Bethesda fucking tried to monetize. Fuck.
---
When modders can do it in 3 days.
---
Zinamax owns ZOS &amp; Bethesda and several other companies. They mey be a corparation but they all work on diffrent games seperatly.
---
2 integers might be too much for this old ass engine
---
Did not say nothing is right or wrong with it.  Was just stating it is not shady.
---
It seems other people here know way more than me, but yeah I saw something about this. "PEER 2 PEER" networking or something along those lines. It also said it wouldnt cost them anything to host a new "server". Doest seem quite right to me, but idk! I'm very curious as to why this server stuff is different. I'd love it even more if anyone could explain it in super basic non-tech speak
---
yup.  we're seeing a real schism bt'n the pc and console communities
---
Probably? Wrong. It definitely should be available to everyone, in fact they LITERALLY stated before they could NOT make it unlimited storage because it would "crash servers" and look, guess that was a lie. And the "other games" you're talking about are probably actually FINISHED games, not the early-access buggy mess that is Fallout 76. And no, for a private server for a year, that's not reasonable, I and most everyone disagrees with you. 
---
Also, it's not a "private" server. Anyone on your friends list can join your world whenever they want. Without your permission. And they can be in your world even if you're offline. So yeah.
---
"Private dedicated servers" is the key word here.
---
If there's any way to describe this whole situation in a nutshell it'll be this https://twitter.com/Paulkdragon/status/1187165730602504192?s=19
---
The only thing they can do to fix Fallout 1^st for everyone is seal the private environments away from Adventure (as in it must use a dedicated character, no jumping back an forth between it and Adv), and giving everyone the scrapbox as they should have done since the beginning.
---
The tent would have been a good addition to the Pioneer Scout storyline, perhaps once they added Squirrel badges, but I guess they have something else in store for that.
---
Sealing the two modes could also lead to actual modding. Leaving the door open would either mean no real modding or that premium users can become legal cheaters based on the mods they use (think Cheat Terminal from Fallout 4).
---
To be fair, Reddit is almost ALWAYS a vocal minority.  It's an echo chamber mostly.  The people that post here are a small small percentage of people that actually play the game.  BS has bigger fish to fry than Reddit.
---
To compare a human being emotionally and physically abused by a partner or relative to a video game company selling digital snake oil to idiots with the biggest of first world problems is disrespectful. If you feel like you could walk up to someone who has been abused and make that comparison seriously, you sir, are delusional.
---
But Zenimax makes the decisions.
---
I agree. Quite a lot of players I know buy those bundles everytime they go on sale...
---
How is not buying a game without micropayments or a subscription telling them anything?
---
I'll be getting it if I feel I can afford it lol it looks amazing and I'm looking forward to getting it myself
---
I guess compared tp the rest of the internet it‚Äôs positive
---
Friend, what you need to understand is just because someone is trying to make quick, easy money, does NOT mean they need it. It often times just means they want it. It started with Skyrim, remember, the game that was released like 6 times? Yeah, they created a masterpiece and were like, "Damn, people are playing this even years afterwards, and we're not making money on them continuing to play it, how can we change that?" 
---
Greed doesn't have to be reasonable, friend. In fact I just made a comparison on another comment I'll post here and maybe it'll kind of show you what I mean, friend.
---
Haha that's the point
---
It feels like a mobile game, doesn't it? Well, they are going to monetize it as such.
---
I gave up on bathesda and on Ubisoft  both a long time ago and it sucks I loved fallout all the up to new Vegas and with all the issues fallout 3 and new Vegas had I was a long process but did buy fallout 4 I think it was cool but 76 I got given for free and I refuse to play that piece of crap so back to my ban lol
---
Yeah It's always brigading. Or maybe the silent majority wants to share its thoughts?
---
&gt; Im sure these people are working themselves to the bone trying to get wastelanders up to the public, but they simply dont have the manpower. 
---
Based on what evidence? Do you work at BGS Austin? Do you know someone who does?
---
This is what you'd like to think. It could be true, granted. It may not be. 
---
I think we can safely say that there is definitely a management issue. All the issues with the patches we've had, the bugs that were fixed that are being reintroduced, the new stashbox not allowing for bulk junk to be stored in there and deleting junk outright at times. Those aren't solely management issues. They're tech level competency issues.
---
Some people within our community on a regular basis not just point out bugs but also point out the exact fix for that bug down to the record/entry that needs to be edited and they still can't get it done or we have to wait for something that's literally seconds to fix (though admittedly more to test).
---
It's not just management dude. It's not that the staff intentionally want to do a bad job. No one wants to do bad work. However, evidence suggest, based on the ongoing issues to this day of previously fixed bugs returning to the game within most patches, there is a question of competency of the low level workers as well, not just management.
---
The Atom Store team on the other hand, absolutely nailing it. They've got their shit together.
---
 Here is the comparison! It'll hopefully paint a clear picture of Bethesda for you. 
---
They should not have expected this game to have large sales. That was incredibly foolish of them, given how this game was really made for nobody.
---
OMG made up reddit points. Oh you have struck me to the core. You realize, obivious your dumb ass didnt, that your post was removed and no one will see this. Great job
---
And if you actually went through and looked you would see I bring up topics and help people along with the bitching
---
Radiation shower in your C.A.M.P.
---
Playing and paying are 2 different things. I paid for it, so i might as well keep playing, but that doesn't mean i'll drop money on mtx.
---
Nobody cares bye
---
Sorry bud. Better luck next time! :)
---
Weren't there a thing, when the game first came out, the devs saying, "Oh, we can't have infinite storage, or increase the storage, because of server limitations, yada yada", which turned into, "We moved from a potato server to a couple, so now we've increased it by a massive 50", or whatever it was.  
---
And now, we can have an infinite scrap storage, behind a paywall?  
---
Isn't that a little weird?
---
I am going to make the comparison because I have been abused by my girlfriend. You insulting the userbase is exactly in line with people insulting me for getting abused. 
---
Stop being a cunt and trying to police what people say, the comparison is very valid.
---
Lol of course. I don‚Äôt care about the armour thankfully.
---
Actually I‚Äôm at the pub tonight even though I dropped a fat Benji on my Fuckit 1^st yearly submission
---
Technically the pit is free. 
---
You have to pay for the balls.
---
That's pretty pathetic to be honest. You're gonna pay a company to not fix something.
---
How else would you find out if a game is worth it (or the company worth supporting) without thorough research and patience?
---
Maybe they shut them down to repurpose them.
---
they have big stupid.
---
You may find /r/fo76filthycasuals refreshing.  :)
---
Expectations weren't met when the development team failed to deliver a signed-off finished product by launch date.
---
Little whale right here ^ 
---
Who cares if they strip content and sell it again as new later? I mean, it costs less then going out for dinner right? I'm not totally being fooled? Wait, am i? Oh
---
I‚Äôm really pushing your buttons hey guy?
---
Okay my dude, I can understand this. Bethesda seems to be going in the EA direction, my dude.
---
I'm waiting for the Horse Armour DLC in TES VI
---
The mere existence of the game should have been a warning sign with fucking bells on to everyone.
---
&gt; I don't even own fallout 76
---
ok
---
I'm unsure why, but it seems most people expected it to be free. With that said, I think people wanted to just play a sorta "offline" mode. Which is kinda silly to be charged for. Also the servers are not persistent. Meaning it shuts down when you leave. Compare this to a server like minecraft. Even if you're gone, anyone else invited can still join (even if they haven't payed) without you around. This also means that in 76 your machines wont continue to produce junk, and your workshops wont even still be yours.
---
Apart from that, theres other reasons I'm sure you know. Such as the scrap box, and tons of bugs with this coming out. Also the biggest thing to really make Bethesda games last is mods. And now it seems with 76 that mods are almost definitely going to be locked behind this paywall as well. But more than anything I think this hate is from people looking for something to hate. They see a thing to be mad about with some valid reason and they choose to be mad. It happens. Gotta remain optimistic... or alternatively you can join the hate. To each his own
---
At least you picked the right season to set up your strawman argument.
---
That's why I paid full price for this incomplete game.
---
No, they're just whining that Bethesda put an OPTIONAL subscription for private instances into the game. And everyone's just jumping on the hate Bethesda bandwagon. They've been doing this same salty song and dance since launch. 
---
Bethesda: Does ANYTHING AT ALL
---
Salty Redditors: THIS IS THE WORST THING THEY'VE EVER DONE! OMG! WHAT A SHITSHOW! LET'S POST OUR ENDLESS HATRED FOR BETHESDA FOR DARING TO DO ANYTHING AT ALL 500,000 TIMES ON REDDIT AND RAGE QUIT ONLINE SO THAT EVERYONE KNOWS HOW DONE WE ARE WITH EVERYTHING BETHESDA! 
---
Bethesda: Does SOMETHING ELSE
---
Wash, rinse, repeat. 
---
If people want to pay for unlimited junk space, let them, doesn't affect you, if you don't want to pay that price, you don't have to, it doesn't make the base game unplayable anymore.
---
No Atari
---
Bye
---
I've seen someone wore it ingame. And it looks a bit weird imo (like chubby Ranger or something). Maybe Bethesda will update it (?) or tweak a bit to make it look better and add in more details into the outfit.
---
*For my personal taste, I prefer a modder's version in fallout 4. He/She made a cooler version of the Ranger armor.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9034
---
I play like before. I'm not planning to buy Fallout 1st, and me not having it doesn't affect me in any way (I'm solo so I don't' need private servers). I have a purpose to play: complete my heavy weapons build
---
The Outer Worlds for me tonight!
---
Where did you see information on the new varients?
---
Adding one or two 5 minute quests every 9 months should be enough to keep people interested. Maybe you are just weird.
---
Yup. This üíØ
---
Source?
---
Sum guy on yt
---
Looks like they want to wipe clean their first wave of customer to make places for more sheeps to milk.  I'm done not only with this game but with Bethesda generally speaking.
---
Its me thats pushing yours?
---
that's somewhat of a loaded question now isn't it? the people who quit probably won't be around to tell you they did so. same with the dwindling playerbase and "everyone online being in private worlds"
---
well no *. everyone else left.
---
personally I'll be putting more time into trying to backport the assets to Fo4.
---
https://youtu.be/3xD1zmlLMKw if this helps
---
munchausen syndrome
---
This sub has always been toxic especially when an update comes out and  is a tiny portion of the playerbase. You only have to play to see that most people have scrapboxes.
---
I really doubt they do these things out of necessity. No, I'm pretty sure they do it out of greed, nothing more.
---
Consider things from Bethesda's perspective. Bethesda, the company. Bethesda has been releasing really buggy games, for a long time. People generally forgave it, because of a combination of just liking the game a lot when it works and a lot of people sidestepping the nastier glitches that can happen. They even did some pretty crappy DLC practices long ago. Horse Armor, remember that? Bethesda was like the OG dev being lambasted for lame stuff to spend extra money on.
---
But how did the fans overall react? They...celebrated Bethesda, defended Bethesda, insisted with fanboy levels of zeal that their games are basically masterpieces, that those who criticize them or complain about glitches are exaggerating, lying, just haters, etc. Fans, out of love for these games, took the time to patch them themselves, and mod them to be better than ever before. For free. Just for the fun of it and joy of sharing with others. 
---
And Bethesda got the credit for that. Their games are, in part, highly regarded because of the modding scene, because of the fanbase's dedication and talent.
---
So what do you think happens to a developer who sometimes...exaggerates things about their games, sometimes outright lies, releases buggy games that needed months more in the oven (especially on consoles), who relies in part on fans to fix up and enhance their game, and their fanbase deifies them, apologizes for them, excuses any mistake or lie they make, insults and demeans those who speak out about the shadier side of Bethesda? What happens is they realize they can get away with lots of bad stuff, and so keep pushing that to see how far they can go. Pushing, pushing and pushing. They took advantage of all the goodwill they accrued in their fanbase, goodwill built in part out of fanboyism, in part out of overlooking innumerable flaws and questionable practices. 
---
Elder Scrolls Blades and Fallout 76, are just the logical conclusion of a dev who has shown time and time again to be unethical and unwilling to admit to faults, who has a fanbase that forgave every mistake, every lie, every game-breaking bug. They conduct themselves now with no respect or regard for the fans, because the fans did not ever hold them accountable and Bethesda has no reason to respect those who see them as incapable of doing any wrong. 
---
Even now... Even now, as I browse this sub, I see a surprising number of people blindly defending Bethesda, and Fallout 76. Insisting that the game's fine, thanking Bethesda even, dismissing all the complaints as just losers, trolls, haters, "entitled" toxic gamers, and so on. They just wish everyone with a negative thing to say would leave, so they could continue enjoying the "great" Fallout 76. 
---
With fans like that... Bethesda can do whatever they want. Almost everyone is still going to buy Elder Scrolls 6 when it comes out, even after all this, and it will not live up to the hype they themselves put out there, it'll be unstable, buggy, unpolished, bloated and unrefined, and fans will mod it into a much greater state eventually, and collectively wipe sweat from their brow and go "Phew, glad Bethesda is back to form in making amazing, great games!"
---
None of this will matter. Gamers are notoriously bad at standing up for themselves, Bethesda will keep abusing that and their fans because they're willing to transmute all the goodwill they earned into unending money.
---
Rockstar is another dev who was (and unfortunately still is) regarded as this great dev, and they are driving their biggest IPs into the ground with microtransaction-laden online games. Rockstar has IPs that are basically printing money for them, game companies aren't doing this out of a need, it's greed. It's purely greed. If they can do it to make more money then why would they not? It's not like they have any integrity, or respect for their fans. 
---
I wish it were obvious to more people.
---
nah, there is no future for this crap....
---
Is that what you think? üòò
---
Nothings changed. I occasionally hope on every week or two, and I'll continue to do so. I am upset about the subscription and I wont buy it, but that's about it. 
---
As a side note, the drama has spiced up the internet for me. Been very fun
---
I remember seeing it in the datamine but why do you think it's going to be a regular atom shop item?
---
Yuuugeee success. munchausen syndrome
---
I bet Microsoft could spot Obsidian the money to buy Fallout from Bethesda, that'd be incredible.
---
Im by no means discounting indies, they're actually some of my favorite games like slay the spire and dead cells both of which i started playing early on in early access so i watched those games become what they are now and im glad those 2 got as much popularity as they have (although i believe they deserve more still)
---
Also ubisoft's getting better? Have you seen breakpoints microtransactions?
---
Cause I care what someone says about a game they don‚Äôt play gtfo.
---
I've heard so many good things about Morrowind I went back and played it. Oblivion was my first ES game, so I didn't expect to be completely jarred by going back in time but, wow was I wrong.
---
I couldn't do it. I really tried, but when I was trying to do quests in the big city, I was wandering around aimlessly most of the time and just wasn't having fun.
---
Not sure what you mean. To clarify, I am on PC. I would suspect that console players would be less likely due to having to already pay a fee just to use an online game (assuming that is still a thing), but that's the only distinction I can imagine at the moment.
---
I got enough content from the modding community to keep me going I'd say. If I never see another Fallout game, I'm fine with that. Better than seeing more of this trash.
---
Granted, Reddit is Reddit :)
---
I decided to never play it, but I love researching / delving into the Fallout 76 mess because it's part of The Fall of The Gaming Industry, which is a fascinating (yet sad) topic. My dad even bought the game (for whatever reason) and so I can download it for free since we share games, but I have no interest. I was going to buy it when it came out but I thankfully remembered nowadays we have to make sure a game is good upon release before buying it. And boy, it wasn't good, so I stayed far away. 
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
No NPC's, no story (and the audio tapes are lore, not an actual story), poor quality graphics, very limited storage in a game where storing items is one of the main things you need to do, and plenty of other things that already show me it's a bad game without me having to even play it. Thankfully because of gaming YouTubers and the reviewers on YouTube also, you can see the problems and successes a game has before you ever have to spend money on it, in fact that's often why the Reviewers buy the games in the first place, to show people whether or not they're worth buying. 
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
I find it really interesting how many people took this long to be done with Bethesda, and I find it even more interesting how some people are STILL defending Bethesda. Someone even said $100 a year for JUST a private server is reasonable...
---
yeah maybe in a another few years the game will be remotely worth a play, with then shitty outdated graphics on an ancient engine. munchausen syndrome
---
I just copped outer worlds today bro, haven‚Äôt had the chance to play it but, tell me it‚Äôs amazing pls
---
You are literally playing a game that cares far far more about money than actual story.
---
For 5 bucks I might think about it, but only if the game was stable and ran flawl8, which it never has.
---
I guarantee you they put the subscription service on sale for the holidays though, especially if the number of subs look weak.
---
Rust. And it‚Äôs fun.
---
I'm paying for just a month to try it out and because I love the outfit and the fast travel storage tent. At the moment I will not be paying more maybe in a few months or after Wastlanders comes out. I'll half to see if Bethesda makes more improvements
---
Nope, only the people that bought 1st. I personally wouldn't touch it with a barge pole as these should be FREE features in the game.
---
&gt; $2.50 horse armor
---
Man, that sounds quaint compared to current pricing schemes. That horse armour now would be at least 1500 Atoms.
---
I should've been more clear, i was more referring to the fact that you actually get a full game with your money and the only money to spend afterwards was on actually worthwhile dlcs (minus oblivion horse armor)
---
Exactly!!! I absolutely agree they're on par with EA. Hahaha, oh gosh, trust me, there'll be FAR more and worse things in TES VI than Horse Armor DLC, they're using Fallout 76 as probably a Monetization test run so they can figure out what they'll do with their future games. Maybe they won't even be single player, it seems Bethesda is greedy enough to make that decision. 
---
"We've heard the community, and we know how much you like the Elder Scrolls Online, so we're proud to introduce you to The Elder Scrolls VI, ONLINE!"
---
I‚Äôd love to play Rust actually, it‚Äôs what I always wanted the survival server to be like haha but I have a console ;)
---
I had played a great deal of Fallout 4, but stopped playing it about a year before Fallout 76 was announced. I had done nearly everything, few exceptions. And continued to play on and on. I liked the different limits the game presented, I spent a great deal of time hauling stuff back to my bases. I never modded it. I never IDDQDt it.
---
Fallout 76 provides new limits, new map to roam, and new things to chase.
---
Today I've played about an hour and dumped off some scip legendaries, killed a sheepsquat, did uranium fever once but only looked one legendary because there was so many other players, dropped off one tecnical data, fiddled a bit with my vending. I've done all of these things, hundreds of times. I like having some routine things I can do for a while. 
---
There are online games I've stopped playing. 3rd one is slowly dying and Im playing it less. I don't stop playing any game because it has changed, or because the developers did something I don't like. I rarely care much about developers, or the changes in games. 
---
&gt;How is any of you capable of paying more than what the game is worth? 
---
I paid 36 euros. Had I not played from the beginning, I could have got it for maybe 20 euros, just few weeks later. I don't value the game. If I want to play it, I have to pay whatever the price is. It's a bit odd concept for me to want to play a game, but not wanting to pay what it requires. If I don't want to pay, I don't see how I really want to play. The world is so full of games. No one play them all. No one can play all great games. You choose. And it's hard not to find games you like playing. Or if it is, the problem is more likely you.
---
Same here. Fallout 1st affects me in no way whatsoever.
---
Frankly the reaction to private servers is bordering on the hysterical. I feel I'm surrounded by shrieking children.
---
You are clearly the weird one here.
---
ROFL! Laymen Gaming "best video game reviewers". HAHAHAHA
---
Oh you poor dear.
---
Beacon seems like the wrong word, but compared to anything on the other gaming subs this place is more positive about the game in general... or was, at least.
---
Coz it's image is ina bundle
---
Bye.
---
I haven't noticed that.  I've actually noticed MORE legendaries.
---
What is the base Luck on your build?
---
Listen. We normally get like 2k people in Appalachia. Since Fallout 1st was announced, we were getting like up to 11k people in this subreddit. That's like 9k plus trolls visiting this subreddit. Doesn't that tell you something? People that come up with shitposts were mostely karma farmers that's never played the game or 'claim' they played at the launch and quit right after that. I'm thinking most players didn't quit and many bought the subscription. It's just these karma farmers and drama seekers that are trying to make a big fuss about Fallout 1st and everything.
---
Yeah the helmet looks a little off makes the head looks rounder and chubby
---
Well this crushes any want to return to this game. Buh bye Bethesda, I'm done with your products.
---
I have literally defended the since release day, but honestly no more, they haven‚Äôt even fixed the main game yet. I still can‚Äôt play on a server smoothly, 3 seconds to enter pip boy, gameplay drops to 10 FPS when using automatic weapons, stuck on terrain, taking damage out of no where, literally I can‚Äôt have fun on it anymore and now look at what they have done. Fuck me. I‚Äôm kinda done with it, I‚Äôve been done with it since Borderlands 3. I picked up MW and Outer Worlds today. I‚Äôd say I probably won‚Äôt be going back to FO76 anytime soon, until I know the games been fucking fixed.
---
Speculation is a source now?
---
Well as they are the main company they should. Just says there doing there jobs.
---
You guys both have "Order of Mysteries" tag, means just like the rest all you do is try to defend someone abusing you lol, I've never even played a fallout game, but reading this sub made me realize how dumb fans are
---
Rockstar is still regarded positively because they make good games, but a good game isn't the only thing we should consider as gamers. I am refusing to support Rockstar for how poorly they treat their workers, good games or not. Just like how I refuse to support any Epic Exclusive games (unless the console versions don't require an Epic account). When gamers realize what they spend money on actually affects the future as well, maybe more gamers will stop spending money on crap, the only problem is like you said, everyone else who still buys the crap enables the companies to keep selling crap knowing it'll sell.
---
Yes. Without a perception debufff
---
I take your point, but experience is not necessarily a requisite for a qualified opinion. I mean, in this case, it probably is.
---
I really advise watching the last video of the YouTuber Juicehead, he explains it perfectly why Bethesda/Zenimax do the things there doing.
---
Believe me, the people who quit are still around because they love nothing more than a good hysterical rant.
---
&gt;Has any other 1st members
---
I'm sorry but whenever I read that I imagine people with the ranger costume and a gold star on their forehead and I just laugh.
---
except it's not a star but a rubbery "toy". and it's pink instead of golden.
---
No one cares.
---
I know it's not atomic, but it dose come up as a skin when looking at paint and it is not ment to be tradable. So I would think it'd be lumped on with them, just thoughts not facts
---
I downvoted, don‚Äôt support karma begging
---
Still waiting on that response. Where are your excuses now? It's okay timmy I'm sure you will just downvote and pretend you can't read again.
---
&gt; What "other side"??  
---
&gt;they LIED about MTX's only being cosmetic  
---
&gt;they LIED about all further content being free  
---
&gt;they LIED bout the servers being private servers  
---
&gt;they LIED bout the canvas bags  
---
&gt;they LIED bout the bottles of booze  
---
&gt;they LIED bout not "crossing the line" with pay to win MTX's
---
Imagine being you lol
---
fun fun
---
luck shouldn't affect legendary spawn rates
---
especially if they're guaranteed like in uranium fever
---
I think the fissure sights have them
---
It‚Äôs not the the grunts/devs. This is TH and his merry band of yes men that really didn‚Äôt give a crap. 
---
It was one thing to get over the fact that all of the games skins at release were directly taken from FO4 (a game that‚Äôs set a couple hundred years later) and then another to get over the multitude of neglect this game has gotten. 
---
I think TH and Co should all be fired for this mess.  Sure I‚Äôll try Wastelanders if it comes out as a free dlc with no more hidden pay to wins. When does that come out again?  
---
If Bethesda had actually been listening to the fans from the start the first thing they would have been focusing on is an NPC element. Private servers like the ones you can now rent from them and maybe mod later on was NEVER a demand of the fans. 
---
It was a complaint about the core game itself. 
---
I have played and defended this game and it‚Äôs people since BETA.  I‚Äôm done with that now and I truly think we all should be. 
---
This game is a POS and anyone who stood by (mngmt) and knew it was before release is a serious POS who deserves to loose their jobs for this fraud of a game.
---
"Best video game reviewers" Sits in a couch, belittling others opinions because you don't agree with them. Sounds like a mature bunch of people.
---
I only just realised this the other day. And I've been playing since the Beta.
---
(PSA for those who don't know - unless you have your own animal there are only two 'wild spawns' of Brahmin. In Flatwoods and in one of the pond to the north east of Top of the World)
---
 This quote is one of the reasons why people thought they would be included with base purchase
---
Pete Hines i forget which interview
---
It's very helpful in the more at night, and in caves. Especially since theres no bright headlamp for the Ultracite
---
Yeah i had some small hope for wastelanders to make this game at least a bit decent but at this point i think even Elder Scrolls 6 will be full of microtransactions, paid mods and other BS that will ruin the experience.
---
It's a nine. But I dont believe luck has to do with events where there are guarantee legendaries.
---
Your friend is me, I did the exact same thing. Wanted at launch, read reviews/gamer comments, decided to get it one day on sale. Bam! Got it for $23(which sounds like the same sale) and am VERY happy with it
---
It's probably P2P, just wait a lil bit everything will unveil on it's own thanks to the cows supporting it
---
Are you Payed To Whine?
---
Just checked, some of these are actually still marked with the F1 prefix in Fo76edit so there's no way to know for sure.

That's pretty impressive.. You need to re-create the server to make mobs respawn?
---
I forgot about local servers. Sorry; the last time I messed with private servers for online gaming was Battlefield 1942 and Battlefield Vietnam.
---
Um, okay? That's cool and all, but if you're just here to insult and stuff, I'll just go ahead and block you cause it's gotten old pretty quick.
---
Its like being you but without wasting my money on something that is clearly a scam and not worth it. And also not being a basement dwelling virgin
---
3 days of silence from  **BethesdaReplied** befuddles me
---
In UK ESO plus is ¬£8.99 a month, in UK FF is ¬£10 a month, so it isn't the exact same price, ESO + also give you access to All the expansions and paid DLCs etc. 
---
Also ESO actually functions correctly
---
How much is a movie and popcorn? That's maybe 2 hours entertainment.  $10 is a great price even if friend doesn't like it.
---
What I take from this is that the difference between 5 and 8 dollars is a massive deal to you.
---
it's dangerous to assume that. you create an imaginary boogeyman and devalue the valid criticism they have.
---
kinda like the "cAn I hAvE yOuR sTuFf?" meme that's been going on since release. except people did quit, a lot of them. the servers are essentially dead if you compare them to roughly a year ago.
---
Peace and hair greese
---
Okay I mentioned this on other post but I'm gonna copypaste it here
---
We normally get like 2k people in Appalachia. After Fallout 1st was announced, we were getting like up to 11k people here yesterday. That's like 9k plus trolls visiting this subreddit. Doesn't that tell you something? People that come up with shitposts were mostly karma farmers that's never played the game or 'claim' they played at the launch and quit right after that. I'm thinking most players didn't quit and many bought the subscription. It's just these karma farmers and drama seekers that are trying to make a big fuss out of Fallout 1st and everything.
---
They can make the best looking 4k mud textures in the business........except it's supposed to be a brick wall.
---
Modders are their own Boss.
---
A Developer is told what he has to do.
---
The bundle may as well be exclusive for the F1 members, as you actually have to claim the items in a separate ATX menu.
---
Spot on you clearly understand how Bugthesda thinks.
---
It seems like the higher ups (suits) in the company are pathetic idiots that have 0 connection to communities and gaming industry. They only care about money.
---
Of course not. You have to pay Atoms to get out.
---
Deleting the post for this reason: https://reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/dmkf51/obsidian_devs_when_being_compared_to_fo76bgs_its/
---
Oh I know about Juicehead, thanks anyway
---
No, it plays Fallout: New Vegas, and Fallout 4 plays like a watered down Fallout: New Vegas.
---
Oh I bet. It has the graphics and gameplay of a 360 game üëç.
---
Quick question.  I understand the joining your world part, but do you mean AFK instead of offline? How can they join a world if you are offline and do not have a world up and running? I am trying to make sure I have my info straight.  Thanks Grumps
---
Don't worry, we all make mistakes.
---
Mine was thinking Bethesda would eventually get their shit together.
---
Just bought Outer Worlds and I'm going to dive in after work.  Hope it's as good as I think it will be.
---
I ask the same question for people like you.
---
I forgot it wasn‚Äôt on consoles lol. Have you played Ark?
---
Time to go on ebay with op weapons :) if someone is ready to pay for scrapbox 100$ per year....hmmm
---
Same, too bad so many restrictions on it.
---
I honestly don't care if those items are things that can be bought in bundles.  If they added the other items to the Atom shop I think the overall anger would go down.  It can still be a "free perk" for the subscription.
---
I know its what you think
---
I personally haven't. On top of that, I actually experienced more legendary spawns and farming for 150 scrips was a piece of cake
---
Funny how you think you have to play a game to judge it. Apparently you don't know what videos are. You know, how you can see exactly what something is and what you do in it without having to play it yourself, isn't that fascinating? 
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
In fact if you didn't know, the people in the US who rate games E or M and all of that? They NEVER play the games. They're shown a presentation the developer or publisher of the game makes, and they're allowed to hide or show whatever they want so it will or won't affect the rating of a game. 
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
I've done far more research than a biased presentation made by Bethesda. I know at launch there were no NPC's, there was no story (audio tapes don't count as a story, it's lore), bad graphics quality, PVP that didn't work well, and low storage space on a game where storing is one of the most important features. I definitely know enough to judge the game and call it bad, and no I didn't have to play it to get all of that factual information. Isn't that fascinating? 
---
And people still think only the ones buying stuff are affected by purchases, which is false. Every time people buy a lazy sh\*t sorry excuse for content that Bethesda releases, you're not only enabling them to continue doing so you're telling them directly to do so, because why would they start to better their games when they can keep being lazy and make a sh\*t ton of money off people who have no standards for games of quality?
---
People have been mad since the beginning....not sure where you are getting your information from. 
---
The only positivity was around Wild Appalachia.  Then things went down again after buggy patches that restored old bugs. Don't forget the content drought over the summer and the failed vault raids.
---
This subreddit has been more doom and gloom than positive.
---
There is a big fossil in a crater that I think is near the lower part of the monorail elevator. I‚Äôll try to find it again.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs great.  But what in the hell is that ‚Äúthing‚Äù in your photo?  Is this meant to be the awakened version of the creature from the Lucky Hole Mine?
---
Fair enough. The horse armor is a good point.
---
I stopped playing a few months ago when a quest reset instead of completing after two hours of doing it.
---
The only thing Fallout 76 offers that other Fallouts don't is I can play it with people I know in real life.
---
Well yeah, legendary farming is easy when you're on your own server. I'm just talking about events where it's supposed to be guarantee legendaries. Like we had a crowned queen show up at scorched earth.
---
Imagine believing what this company says, it doesn't even matter anymore after all the lies
---
So just because someone is braindead enough to enjoy this piece of shit instead of something that's actually good like Warframe or Destiny the game is immune to criticism?
---
I used to have a pre-built camp that I blueprinted, but a large building is very hard to position unless you have a single foundation build. However these days I much prefer to build new each time and incorporate by structure into the landscape. More fun.
---
Many people farm purified water to sell for caps.
---
Mirelurk kings are tough and nasty. They're meant to be. But I fear bears far more.
---
I mean you shouldn't expect any differently at this point, really. I haven't been targeting premium players specifically, unless they post something blatantly wrong. I've been focusing on Bethesda specifically.
---
I just now realized that's how I see premium players and assumed that's how others do, as well. personally I couldn't do that to myself. it's like a badge of shame, really.
---
you should go to filthycasuals if you can't take the heat. they're a lot more accepting of whatever bs Bethesda throws their way. and I mean that in the nicest way possible, you can't expect people not to mock you. not here, not now.
---
I never really thought about limiting the access between Private server and your character from main Adventure. It really does make sense, because if you can mod the game in a way to introduce leveling exploits (not like there's non right now, but still), your Adventure character will be so easily buffed.
---
And still, main idea is to meet random people and interact with them on events and such.. so adventure profile is still a very important one.
---
It feels as if this idea was so rushed... Ofc it was in the brewing for a long while, no doubt about that, but the way they've executed it, just makes me think it was pushed by higher beings at Zenimax/Bethesda.
---
Yes, because the totally optional tag that you can switch at anytime means that we're a united front to let Bethesda walk all over us. It's not like we can't switch the tag on the fly whenever we want. 
---
Or, some of us have seen people who already hate bethesda flood this sub to throw shade at something they don't even have to buy. A lot of these salty redditors have long ago abandoned 76, they just are angry people who have little else to do but participate in outrage culture. Sure, the nylon bag and the alcohol people bought were crap. Thankfully I didn't jump on that bullshit when it came out. 
---
This subscription service I did buy, and I did it because of all the hate thrown at it. I've found it to be really good. I like being able to go to locations on the map and it not be completely looted when I get there. Frankly, this game is great without the other players involved.
---
I would like to thank fo76 for providing me hours of entertainment for the cheap price of zero by giving me a great laugh every time I visit this sub. Lol.
---
That's my mom's little angel.. the only thing she is proud of... Q\_Q
---
no matter how you paint it a 5 minutes fix is a 5 minutes fix.
---
So you are that kind of person that don't experience for yourself but rather listen to others and make decisions based off of that. Good on you. I give it 6 months till you hand over your life savings to a total stranger
---
Who said Doom Eternal won't have microtransactions?
---
The server isn't yours to run, it's still a server Bethesda runs and you just get to join it privately, and then anyone on your friends list can join as well anytime they want. I don't know if they can join when you're offline but I've already heard people saying they don't get booted out even if no one on the server currently is a Fallout 1st Member, so even if they can't join when you're offline, they can stay in the game if you and every other Fallout 1st Member leave, which is also completely contrary to what they said. 
---
You're welcome, and sorry if I sound mad, not mad at you, just at how ridiculous the gaming industry is now.
---
Why do people have to be IGNORANT just because they paid for something YOU don't believe in. I mean damn, if YOU don't believe in it then either don't pay or play. Noone is forcing anyone to buy the subscription....... IT IS JUST A VIDEO GAME.
---
Yeah pretty much. People is trying to explain me why they play this game, they give all sorts of reasons but the fact it is an online game is the only thing that keeps them going. IMHO
---
Isn't that basically the same thing?
---
There are no addictive features to their monetization model, so don't feel bad. It's not your responsibility to manage other people's entertainment budget.
---
They've been fine for me. One Violent Night has always spawned a lot of crowned for me in the trash waves, but the Wendigo was 3*.
---
Fixed? They still haven't fixed FO4 all the say as they allowed the Mod Community do the bug fix overhaul.
---
Maybe I haven‚Äôt drank enough coffee yet, but what is tp?
---
Oh absolutely bro
---
Bethesda: ‚ÄúNo‚Äù
---
the handful of screenshots IS what you are getting, the idea this is some big new overhaul isn't real, wastelanders is gonna be a short 15 minute minor thing, the number of screen shots is reflecting the amount of content coming.
---
I just unload the scrapbox into my characters inventory before I log out and or change worlds.
---
Teleport. I guess the correct use is fast travel though lol
---
Well it did happen from time to time for me on adventure servers. Sucks balls but ain't nothing new.
---
Ok make sure to leave the sub once you‚Äôre done too.
---
We don't hate the game, we hate the playa. Well, a lot of us anyhow.
---
It was almost 50% off a mere *WEEK* after launch actually.
---
The ‚Äúworld‚Äù in Ark or Conan isn‚Äôt really my cup of tea. I pretty much play 76 like the Sims, except instead of going to some silly job I have Appalachia and it‚Äôs a pretty nice world :) 
---
I think on consoles it‚Äôs a one of a kind game but on PC there is sooo many options that all the terrible marketing etc has made this shit storm haha. I can‚Äôt even think of one game coming that has good building, online, and a world worth being in, I‚Äôm stuck lulz :)
---
Ah, yes. Thanks.
---
Like you I play solo. I couldn't possibly care less about camp items or outfits. I did get the coal skin for the excavator armor because I got sick if the LEGO yellow looking thing. This was with atoms I accumulated simply by playing the game and achieving atom goal without even deliberately trying to. 
---
I have over 4k atoms sitting there because there just isn't anything in the shop that I want. I also still enjoy playing the game,  but aside from the original purchase price I will not spend any additional real money on it. 
---
I will keep playing. I started a second character which is my focus now(my main was melee and I mostly just farmed with it,  didn't even do much questing). I just did the dmv quest (not sure whether I want to commend the creators for the  often accurate example of government efficiency or to smack them for this annoying quest, lol). 
---
FO 1st  is optional. If you're like me where you're perfectly happy playing the base game and don't need atoms or outfits, then just keep playing and enjoy it.
---
You're giving them 100 bucks a year for a shitty game that has no content (not even NPCs, for fucks sake) for private servers that aren't private (and probably unstable as fuck, too) and on top of that having all your items removed, good deal huh? And let's not forget Bethesda's history of being an overall shitty company with its colors only now being revealed by this soulless cashgrab of a game.
---
Yeah I got bored of it a while back, without any real story content and nothing but cosmetic or P2W items I just decided to stop playing. I got my time out of it. I enjoyed it for the most part. But now I really feel that I can not support the direction that Bethesda is taking this game, which is a shame because I always thought of Bethesda as one of the last good game companies, but it seems the fans have been sold down the river.
---
Naw, see I was taught to treat people with respect and not insult others for how they spend their money. I can take plenty of heat and I dont have to go anywhere. It's not a badge of shame, cause if it was, I wouldnt be coming across 8 out of 10 people with the scrap boxes and outfit. Mocking people like you're a five year old cause you dont like how they spent their money is quite pathetic and just plain stupid at this point. I'm too old to be dealing with this dumb high school shit.
---
Bethesda seems to have an odd obsession with shooting themselves in the foot, don't they?
---
more legendaries for me.
---
First login to the private instance, my friend took a power plant and the defend event spawned several legendary muties escorting a 3\* behemoth.
---
Same thoughts as me.
---
Its a shame cus wild Appalachia was amazing imo, but since the summer its been poor. I don't like BR so that's a whole mode I don't touch, and I really don't like the raids. What is even more of a kicker is all new reward type things are going into the atom shop. The fridge, skins etc. Some of that could of been put into the game as a reward for something. 
---
Its stupid and immersion breaking that we go on to grind atom challenges to buy new stuff in the atom shop. Its completely put me off the game.
---
It‚Äôs not pay to win just a scam to get money.
---
I've heard this theory and I don't think this is the case. Fallout 76 uses Amazon servers like Fortnite and some other games, so they are supposed to be pretty good. Sadly, Fallout 76 is just too big of a game (too many containers, bigger map with only few independent cells, etc.) to support 24-32 people in a server. This is why Private Servers only allow 8 people. Bethesda are openly admitting defeat on that front and it is just sad.
---
I always wanted to see how this game will perform in a single player environment but never thought Bethesda will make us to pay for it. The game should've released as a single player with an option for Co-op. Then gradually progress towards an MMO-like experience. But that meant Bethesda will need to make a good base game and they just didn't want to do all the work.
---
It is over guys. R.I.P Fallout 76, nobody will ever miss you.
---
Is that new game from an existing series? Or is is brand new
---
Yup. It costs 60 bucks at launch.
---
Yeah those crowns I'm use to. Maybe I just got a few trash servers. I'll keep testing it then.
---
Nope. I appreciate the information. I understand your frustration and do not sound mad to me or at me..lol Thank for getting back to me. Grumps
---
Fucking hell, lmao. It HAD to be Reddit of all places where you see people defending this.
---
Not bad
---
You're not slow. That is exactly what you can do.
---
Haha, you're the actual person doing that, handing over your life savings to Bethesda. Of course you couldn't argue my actual points either, and no, I'm not "listening to someone" I'm looking at the facts. Are you that daft that you think a video of a game is somehow faker than playing the game itself? You see the same characters, the same graphics, the same play-ability and things to do, nothing is different other than things like how the controls feel, which if you didn't notice, I didn't comment on anything like the controls, since I don't know how they feel. But I can recognize what I don't know, unlike you, who still defends the crappy game with no logic and again, couldn't argue a single one of my points.
---
Found MtG: Arena yesterday :)
---
Things seem to have calmed down a bit this morning, this comment would have started an inferno yesterday.
---
That's sarcasm right?
---
Yeah, I'm wondering if I just had a trash server for a private one. I've since relocated private worlds.
---
Appreciate it friend, and glad so!
---
Are you really comparing "ESO+" to "FO76 FU 1st"?
---
Take my downvote good sir.
---
Brand new.
---
Whhhaaat??? Sarcasm??? Nooooo way :/
---
You got to be nuts not to expect it to be on sale on Black Friday the latest. Though it might only apply for the 1 year deal.
---
 Yeah I got bored of it a while back, without any real story content and  nothing but cosmetic or P2W items I just decided to stop playing. I got  my time out of it. I enjoyed it for the most part. But now I really feel  that I can not support the direction that Bethesda is taking this game,  which is a shame because I always thought of Bethesda as one of the  last good game companies, but it seems the fans have been sold down the  river.
---
Imagine being a pushover like this and allowing game companies to charge $100 a year to players who already bought the broken game and lying about everything being free
---
Mods also don't fall out of the sky, mods are people working for free, because they like a game and want to create things for an audience. Who is going to be writing these mods where to even test your own mod you need to keep a 100 dollar subscription so that a tiny tiny userbase of the dumbest people on earth could maybe play it.
---
Well we still got double the visitors here so it ain't over yet
---
yawn bye
---
The defeatist cynicism masquerading as wisdom is pathetic.
---
I enjoyed the game since the private beta. And I still love playing it with my friends. Buy at the same time you can‚Äôt ignore the problems and the ignorance of Bethesda.
---
Flashlight of positivity
---
well, yeah. you wouldn't be seeing people who've left because of the outrage, now would you?
---
you're absolutely right, it's your money and you can do whatever you want with it. but your decision to support anticonsumerism affects us all.
---
I feel sorry for the people that wasted their time on this shitty game.
---
We were paying close to USD100 PER MONTH for a 40 slot DayZ server on Fragnet a few years back.  100 bucks PER ANNUM is a hugely discounted price.
---
I feel you, my dude! Many of us feel the same way, but sometimes it is just best to move on.
---
The refrigerator and scrap bot were actual pay2win mechanics. Pay2win is an ingame advantage for real money. It doesn't matter if you can also grind to get that advantage.
---
Hang in there.
---
Just to remind you...  
---
["It just works"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPN0qhSyWy8)
---
They probably priced it a few $ more so later they can lower it and say "hey, we've heard your feedback and are happy to announce that 1st is now only $9.99/mo." :)
---
People who really want it, buy. Or buy the whole year straight off.
---
But if two months later you drop the price, what happens? You sell more. Those who hesitated, buy it then.
---
What kind of company would not sell if they can.
---
The fact that anybody would equate being a beaten spouse with an optional video game purchase is frankly, the reason why Bethesda won‚Äôt pay too much attention to an angry Reddit thread.
---
How much shit is too much?
---
yeah, i'm of the opinion that the obscene amount of enemies per square meter is the main cause for this crazy expenditure ratio, but i geuss that's one way of fixing things.
---
And GTA online being shit for monetization somehow means other games should also do shitty things?
---
Or does the fact that there is a worse game out there excuses fallout 76 from anything it does?
---
Grind is also a part of the problem its the backdrop that allows "convenience" to be sold again look at some mobile games and you'll quickly start to see some similarities. 
---
Also great in-game advice but it's almost like i already know not to fill a limited stash with junk items . . .
---
Exactly. Bethesda could careless if one person or a million are complaining. They allready got our money. Its the whales they are trying to satisfy now. Bethesda could not give a shit about people whos wallets are closed to them. 
---
Honesty  I attempted to play last night for about 20 minutes.  Just to see how many people actually bought the paid service. I counted 7 on the server i was on. Before i logged off Ended up talking with one guy. Really nice guy so i got nothing against him but he told me the whole reason he paid for the service is the ranger armor and the atoms. Those are Bethesda new targets. The ones willing to shell out a lot of money for stripped content and broken features.
---
Hard facts
---
Positivity or denial. While everyone was saying Betheada has lost their way, this sub praised them, put money into their shitty atom store and begged for more. 
---
Now that it's impossible to deny, suddenly everyone comes around. 
---
"we heard your request, and will add more non cosmetic items to the store. Btw, pay us more for private servers that are broken and quality of life mechanics that should've been in the game for free"
---
This is the legacy of this sub.
---
Idc who left. And I'll spend my money how I like. If you dont like the choices I or the game make, then go on. No one is forcing you to stay.
---
Lol I equated the syndrome not the beaten wife you dope
---
"cAn I hAvE yOuR sTuFf?"
---
My shotguns are still over-nerfed. Ain't fixed that, ain't coming back.
---
That the developers don't give one fuck about us is incidental.
---
I honestly think this entire game is just a ploy to see how much they can get away with. I feel good in that Starfield and ES6 won‚Äôt have this bullshit going on.
---
We play because the game is actually fun. It's just that you eventually run out of content in late game. It was buggy AF at launch and that's where most of the bad press is from. EXCEPT! Everything they introduce adds more bugs. Including fixing other bugs. And the pay to win shit Bethesda did with fallout 1st. That's totally fair to call that out and it should be happening.
---
To answer a couple more of your questions though: You said people give them money for atom shop stuff. Well I have tons of stuff from the atom shop. Nearly a dozen power armour skins, dozens of camp objects, outfits, weapon skins. All sorts. None of it cost me any real money. They give away atom points in the game for free. Despite spending probably 9-10k in atoms over the last year I've still got 4000 right now. That's ¬£40 if I'd paid for it (bollocks am I doing that). So it's a bit misleading to say a power armour skin costs ¬£15. Frankly this aspect is an improvement on Fallout 4, where you got 200 CC points for free and that's all. Rest is paid for. At least you can earn those in this game. So the atom shop is not 'paid items' unless you pay because I haven't paid for any of it. Yeah I *could*... But im not. It's all free to me.
---
Tbh though that's an argument we even have regularly on this sub. Even here most people call it paid too. I dunno, maybe they are paying.
---
It puzzles me that people bought and defend it, lol. What did they expect with Fo76s track record? Maybe they should have listened to the critics that they instead yelled ‚Äùtoxic‚Äù to.
---
Of course I'm not wasting my time arguing with you. Obviously you don't even play. Why I gotta give a fuck about a random drama seeker that's still sitting around when the party's been over for hours? Go home kid
---
Needed to be said
---
The subscription isn‚Äôt even bad is just the scrapbox that‚Äôs triggering people myself included.
---
See, people keep saying that thing about how broken the game is. And that‚Äôs my point. Posts that are *actual* feedback, ie ‚Äúthis is bugged‚Äù are fine. 
---
Posts that are ‚ÄúI HATE THIS TRADH BROKEN GAME‚Äù are just blowing hot air.
---
Or it could just be that they're desperate to monetise the game and none of their tricks so far have worked. Overpriced straight cosmetics only didn't work so they moved onto misleading sales. From misleading sales to bundles. From bundles to utility items. From utility items to reduced free Atoms rewards from Challenges. Reduced challenge rewards to a subscription.
---
Sounds to me that either the publisher is getting real greedy or rather than face up the fact that they did a poor job at the cosmetics only stuff and work on that some more to do the job better, they went the lazy route and tried to manipulate and scam us for our money.
---
The thing I genuinely do not understand... love of fallout and the universe aside. Why would anyone defend this game? It was lying since the second it was announced and continues to lie and betray the few people that still play it to this day.
---
They've already done the subscription service before, and it pretty successful. They're just using something that's worked before in an effort to get some more revenue into this game.
---
Single player games already have their own "premium content for extra money" with deluxe editions and what have you.
---
you can get it for $1 if you have a gaming PC if you get it with Microsoft's Game Pass for PC. (Check the Microsoft Store)
---
No, what I said, in complete context, is "Bethesda was one of the first companies to essentially INVENT microtransactions." 
---
You're taking what I said and thinking "he said Bethesda was the first company to literally do microtransactions!".
---
What you're leaving out are two parts. "Bethesda **was one of** the first companies" and "**essentially invent"**. The first acknowledges there were other companies, the second means they didn't literally invent microtransactions.
---
I'm not going to keep arguing by pulling specific points out of your reply, but Oblivion came out in 2007. Facebook was just starting to gain traction at that time. If we're going to stretch for points like that, we might as well say online poker did it first. I don't care about what was going on behind closed doors at gaming companies. I care about who was one of the first to make it go mainstream.
---
Bethesda's actions with the horse armor were one of the first big pushes to monetize content outside of the initial purchase and subsequent expansions. No other company prior had the balls to try such a thing across both consoles and PC. It made major headlines across all gaming sites. The entire gaming community was in an uproar.
---
This is silly because you're arguing a completely different thing than I am.
---
For a surprising amount of time it was very positive, however. It's only in the last few months that the tide has turned.
---
No, the mobs respawn really quickly, maybe every 15-20 minutes. Clearing the entirety of whitesprings, then west tek, then the burrows and finally doing a silo run is more than enough time to be able to repeat the cycle straight away. A fair few legendaries too actually, I‚Äôm going to have to send them over to a mule account or I‚Äôll get weighed down.
---
Now that I think about it, I could probably clean out the scrip vendor on 5 different characters a day with just a few hours work.
---
For sure, and will likely happen again.
---
&gt; Funny how you think you have to play a game to judge it
---
*sigh*
---
and like I said, that's your god-given right. but by buying into mobile, predatory business practices, you're affecting other people. and it's also their god-given right to mock you for that.
---
what I'm saying is that you shouldn't be surprised just like I'm not surprised people actually bought into it.
---
Yeah, I legit don't how you can still defend Bethesda after all these years of being lazy sellouts. F76 is a gift that keeps on giving, fuck up after fuck up, even going to the point of breaking the law, but no, it's the sheeple who are too stubborn to give this obvious cash grab a chance, this shitty attempt to reproduce others success, this "we have (whatever better alternative at home)" meme in its most literal form.
---
I think for some the issue is that Bethesda never seemed like that type of company until recent years. Now all this monetisation is actually affecting the game design and product people bought in to. I remember the reviews for fallout 4 being not too kind based on the bugs. Especially bugs that have been present since morrowind. They‚Äôve been doing this type of game for more than a decade and still can‚Äôt get very basic things sorted. The anger directed at Bethesda is to do with a lot more than just monetisation. It‚Äôs the way they‚Äôve implemented it too. There‚Äôs just so much things to list now and that‚Äôs why the anger has gotten to this point. We as customers drew a line in the sand and they just laughed at it and monetised the sand.
---
you're acting as if they're listening, the only time they listen is when you have something to request so they can pay wall it, there's no good faith here, just exploitation....
---
They never said everything would be free. Hence they said all content would be free. As in Events, dlc's like Wastelanders. But to make said content it takes alot of $$$. As such we the players want certain items and thoes added items cost $$ so it would be in there best intrest to put a pay wall behind certain things.
---
I don't see the difference from what you guys are receiving.
---
Well duh no one wants to jump in front of a firing squad. 
---
Speech is silver, silence is golden. This is really the moment where it's best not to say a damn thing.
---
Don‚Äôt like his videos with the camp destroying and the pay us caps or else B.S .   Is the tactics I was referring  to.  Not comparing one to the other
---
I joined this sub just recently and it became way more toxic after the fallout-first announcement. Came from battlefield and enjoyed the sub - now it‚Äôs just like over there.
---
I was too, but I gave up when the vault raids were pigshit. I knew then that they haven't gotten it right by now, they never will.
---
I'm on PS4 so
---
Cheap, single LED flashlight with a very weak battery...
---
\-We all knew that private servers would be paid for, not free. This was clearly stated along with the fact that you will host it through Bethesda.
---
\-The scrapbox is nice but only if you're a hoarder. You cant put anything else in it and cant even store non-scrapped junk items. All this does is take away a small portion of inventory management. 
---
\-The tent is at best a convenient fast travel point for free. You can put stuff in your stash but you cant scrap anything. You dont have access to your scrapbox.   
---
I could see if they charged for Wastelanders after saying it would be free, but none of this stuff was promised as free. It falls in line with other Atom shop items like scrap kits and the fridge. Nothing is taken away from your original purchase. You are not missing in game content. None of this helps paying customers win a rare PvP encounter.   
---
Personally, I was already spending 10-20$ a month in the Atom Shop (40$ one month). Subscribing gave me more Atoms for less. The subscription was a pretty easy decision.
---
Bethesda is fucking up lately and I don't need a Doritos-eater stupid clickbaiter 'youtuber' to tell me that...
---
This is exactly what I've been saying. When people complain and say "muh Bethesda need to make money" or "muh just ignore it"... The issue isn't with the sub. A sub that gives atoms at a good rate, monthly cosmetics and atom store discounts would have done amazing, which little backlash. 
---
But adding ideas that the community suggested behind a paywall is insane. Even if they'd put it so the tent and stash box is free to F1st subbers, but other people can get them on the atom store (meaning you could potentially grind for them for free) it wouldn't be as bad.
---
It makes me feel like they're doing this to tank their stocks or something, some sort of insider trading scam.
---
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have defended the game. Most critiques people had were legit. There were so many controversies and slow reactions from Bethesda. Meanwhile they keep releasing overpriced cash shop cosmetics and grinding out the atoms makes you feel like you paid full price for a mobile f2p game. It was a bad model from the start and while it is cool to play with friends this really isn‚Äôt the multiplayer anyone asked for, even if you do like it.
---
we did move on we just came back to remind you that the game is still garbage.
---
Do you like Pirates?
---
There are literally dozens of posts discussing why people find this reasonable/unreasonable.
---
This is pure gold. It's beyond my understanding why people are paying for this.... Surely Bethesda will milk you for the end of days
---
To me the mask looks flat faced more than it originally did.
---
You have never played the game.  You freely admitted to it in another thread.
---
Reddit is a shilling device for companies.
---
preach
---
True
---
Hope this sub gave you as little clicks as possible lol
---
Isn‚Äôt VI going to be single player? I don‚Äôt see a subscription being viable in a Bethesda single player game. They‚Äôre well known to be moddable and include the ability to do almost anything via console commands.
---
Kinda sucks that most of em are 1* Beth needs to increase the chance to find 3* Legendaries is not bad since they don‚Äôt always drop 3* Loot.
---
They didn‚Äôt sell what they thought they were gonna sell, they‚Äôve hit the wall with trying so this is there last best hope to try and make back money.
---
6 wont be a paid subscription imo but if it is it will not sell and I guarantee it‚Äôll be the death of Bethesda
---
Friend, what do you mean? Bethesda doesn't care about you or any community other than their investors. I fully admit I haven't played the game but I definitely researched it and can discuss it absolutely with many details. But don't you remember how Bethesda turned on the modding community with the "paid mod" crap? That also crapped on the modders themselves because if they went with Bethesda's deal they got a one time payment and if Bethesda made a million dollars off of the mod they kept it ALL and that person only got to keep their one time small payment. And then how Bethesda just doesn't seem to care about the Single Player Game fans that made them what they are today. And a "shaky release" is a huge understatement to the alpha, early-access despicable state the game was in at launch, friend. 
---
I love how you and the community could remain positive, but sometimes positivity is just being a push over when you let it go too far. They won't care about this backlash like they haven't cared about any previously because people still buy their crap. That's the sad truth of the matter. It's only when their bottom line hurts that they "care about what the community thinks." And then they continue to always go back on that. I have no problem with anyone enjoying a bad game, though. I just think people should accept that it is a bad game that was not worth a $60 price tag and DEFINITELY should not have any subscription services for (at least not in the current state it's in).
---
Two peer devices would not be able to establish a socket connection without one of them having a listener on the socket and firewall rules in place to allow connections to the port on which that listener socket is bound. Proxying the connection through a central server that both peers connect to would bypass the need to have a firewall rule in place, but would also completely negate the entire purpose of this conspiracy.
---
You can debunk this yourself using various methods. One of the easiest in Windows 10 is to use Resource Monitor and filter down to the Fallout76.exe. Observe network activity while sitting on the main menu vs connected to a world. Then connect to a different world. You will observe that your client connects to two distinctly different EC2 addresses (assuming you get different worlds on connection attempts).
---
Consider this debunked.
---
The definition of p2w is that you can pay real money for ingame advantages. That includes pay2progress, so it doesn't matter if you can grind for it or not. Despite some games being worse than others, the definition doesn't include how bad it has to be, so yes, F76 became pay2win when they introduced repair kits, even though you couldn't literally pay to "win" as there is no win condition in this game.
---
pay walling a requested item for improved game pay should have been your first sign that things were goign to get bad before they got better, that and THE ENTIRE LAUNCH OF FALLOUT 76....
---
  Its a lot like other Fallouts in there are many places to discover and lots of territory to explore.  Along the way, following the overseers questline, you'll discover the story behind why things are the way they are.
---
Yea, its different because most things you meet try to kill you, and most talking things are bots, some friendly, some not, but its still Fallout.  The lack of NPCs as presented in previous versions is different than what you are accustomed to, but there are still story (and mission) lines from factions you are familiar with, and a few new factions as well.
---
With a couple of exceptions, interactions with other players is not a requirement - you can solo if you want.
---
This particular forum can be rather caustic (as you have likely noted) - try one called /r/fo76filthycasuals for a different point of view - point is, don't let the acidic nature here stop you from giving it a try.
---
Plus every patch they do costs extra Money.
---
Sighing, what a great argument. Of course you couldn't reply to any actual points I have, and you're so ignorant you think videos of a game don't show you the game? I think you need to go back to school.
---
Actually what they did counts as false advertising. It's kinda illegal. I mean, I know being a *finger quotes* world weary cynic is cool and all when you're 15, but you gotta grow up someday.
---
It is official; Netcraft confirms: Bethesda is dying
---
One more crippling bombshell hit the already beleaguered Fallout76 community when IDC confirmed that Fallout76 market share has dropped yet again, now down to less than a fraction of 1 percent of all MMOs. Coming on the heels of a recent Netcraft survey which plainly states that Fallout76 has lost more market share, this news serves to reinforce what we've known all along. Bethesda is collapsing in complete disarray, as fittingly exemplified by failing dead last in the recent GDC comprehensive performance test.
---
You don't need to be a Kreskin to predict Bethesda's future. The hand writing is on the wall: Bethesda faces a bleak future. In fact there won't be any future at all for Bethesda because Bethesda is dying. Things are looking very bad for Bethesda. As many of us are already aware, Fallout76 continues to lose market share. Red ink flows like a river of blood.
---
Fallout76 is the most endangered of them all, having lost 93% of its core developers. The sudden and unpleasant departures of long time bethesda developers Brendan "Big B." Hubbard and Lucas Santino only serve to underscore the point more clearly. There can no longer be any doubt: Bethesda is dying.
---
Amen!
---
So many Ranger skins in game that suggest *majority* of players just purchased the content.
---
It proves the sub is full of complainers and toxicity.
---
Like you said, if you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy it, but just play the game already and continue having fun, regardless if you take the paid pathway or not!
---
ummm, what about the launch? 16X the what? detail? LOL
---
"Oh and by the way, everything after release, all the dlc and updates, are free, completely free"- Pete Hines. Getcho facts right dumb dumb
---
There are plenty of folks who enjoy 76 and don‚Äôt experience the bugs for whatever reason (myself included. I guess I‚Äôm lucky) who just want a community where we can meet up without a million trolls coming in to tell us how trash the game is.
---
I'm glad you understand it would be a waste of time since you don't have any actual arguments! It's so funny how someone who hasn't played the game apparently knows more about it than you who has played the game.
---
I ain‚Äôt mad bruh. It‚Äôs just a game, something to play to pass time.
---
I love how Bethesda creates the problem and then sells you a solution. GG.
---
Fallout 76 came out on my birthday on launch day, I was so excited It never crossed my mind to wait for reviews I loved the game despite all its bugs, then I ran out of questlines.
---
Now it just feels like an MMO (not a genre I enjoy) where the only thing you can do is grind for better stuff for the hell of it, I stopped playing after I hit level 250 and was so bored I found myself being a dick to players cause I had nothing else to do. 
---
I wish I qualified for a refund.
---
I feel like is an even trade for me. I've spent 2300 hours into the game, I've not been plagued by many of the issues others have had, and I have no issue giving back to a game I enjoy and love. I love being an exclusive member, I love my badge of "Shame", i love my private servers and guaranteed atoms each month. This game has given me a lot and I plan to keep supporting it.
---
Watching a Youtube of gameplay != actual experiencing gameplay
---
I mean i play other games with micro transaction and i never paid a dime. But, these games do work. Basically what you guys are telling me is i grind a buggy game because i liked its previous games. If you guys really loved the franchise you would've ditch this fallout wanna be. The fallout fans deserve much much better.
---
Well dedicated sub pretty sure did happen naturally on its own independent of hate on main sub, I think FO3/FNV/FO4 also have each their own as far I recall.  
---
But split did happen with Fo76 in terms of userbases, those who disliked stayed on main one, fans of 76 came here.  
---
But since people here were not actually blindly uncritical and did actually get angry due to certain issues that happened, that other sub happened because they were pissed at fact that people here, "supposedly fans" of Fo76 were getting pissed off by issues that did happen.
---
What can ya do, such is life.
---
And? I admitted it in multiple threads. What does that mean? You think I have no physical ability to know anything about the game because I didn't play it? You apparently don't know how knowledge and information work.
---
I don't agree much lately but yeah, in virtual goods and services, as well as buying IP produces in general, the consumer rights are really dragging behind.
---
It doesn't help how the software/internet industry has pretty non-existing standards.
---
That's not for you to decide I'm afraid.
---
Jesus just the title alone sounds like someone with beaten wife syndrome
---
At this time we recommend trying the following:
---
Uninstalling the game. 
---
Demanding a Refund.
---
Suing the company for multiple cases of fraud and exploitation.
---
Never buying another Bethesda game until they sort their shit out, business practices and bugs combined. 
---
Thank you for your unwarranted faith in us as a company despite us being horrible.
---
Zenimax wants more money over time instead of the initial burst of money when the game comes out. Zenimax is the parent company of BGS and is most likely forcing these calls onto them.
---
Imagine Joe Vargas coming up with an hour long review of a game without even playing for himself. That's exactly what you are doing here
---
Link the rest of the datamines? I'd appreciate it my guy, helps me make a decision about purchases and stuff. I skipped the original fridge because I saw the Arktos one in datamines
---
Well I‚Äôm on Xbox, and so far so good. I have no complaints.
---
You only know what others have told you.  If that's good enough for you, that's fine.  But - it greatly diminishes your arguments.
---
Yup. Sitting on the private server, taking a break to browse reddit. Fun so far!
---
Whats the eta now?
---
Thanks for the info. I found two 3\*s. One was at RobCo Research Center and one at Spruce Nob
---
I know the one you are talking about.  IIRC, you pass it headed south towards watogo.
---
Everyone‚Äôs saying bethesda only cares about the numbers, but from what we can tell the game has performed poorly no?
---
I had 3 attack my camp last night, 2 of which were legendary, 1 of which was a 2 star. 
---
In generally I personally don't have a problem with the rarity of 3 star legendary enemies. I really don't even consider them all that rare nor would I consider myself a legendary farmer. I certainly run into more than one every night.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you think that at all. Anyone who‚Äôs expecting such a massive dlc shouldn‚Äôt be so dumb to expect a ‚Äúperfect‚Äù update at all
---
I cant wait for it to come out but I know that there will be game breaking bugs in there, just waiting patiently and enjoying the game as I  know how things go
---
ETA?
---
Hahahaha thanks mate, I needed a good laught
---
Haha, no, when did I say it's experiencing gameplay? Never did. But you apparently are claiming you can't understand how something is based on seeing it with your own eyes. So you could be shown every single thing about a game, the whole run-through of a game, but you never touched the controller, so according to your logic it would mean you know nothing about it. Pretty funny "logic" you have there.
---
such private
---
When had wastlanders been push back till
---
It wasn't really a secret? Anybody who cared enough knew these guys were the Austin team, the ones who built the online multiplayer mode for Doom4 (and nobody liked it, as opposed to everybody loving the singleplayer as we know) and then had their only title scrapped from underneath them.
---
I mean if you played until level 250 how many hours did you spend?
---
You are missing out on quite a bit, my friend.  Slow down a bit.
---
Ture mods are better on the pc versions of fallout and skyrim though. Console they are not that great.
---
The problem is there's no real way to legally draw a line. All games have bugs. What criteria can you physically put on paper that makes sense 100% of the time that defines when a game is too broken
---
Why would we leave when this sub gives us so many laughs?
---
It will be buried under the other hundred outrage posts about the exsact same thing.
---
Oh good source! Well if some guy on YouTube said it..
---
Reminds me of the battered women that the husband beats the shit out of until they are black and blue and they lay in the hospital bed saying "I still love him!"
---
I have been waiting for months now! We actually should have got it a month ago now we have to wait a good SIX MORE MONTHS!
---
This guy clearly has low IQ and thinks hes smart. Those are the worst kinda people, haha.
---
No, I haven't purchased it but there is plenty of information available on the features it offers so one can make an assessment on whether it would enhance your enjoyment of the game. Since I've purchased Atom bundles in the past I was most interested in the Atoms and I was interested in the scrap box since I'm a terrible hoarder. Well, I have more Atoms than I can use right now thanks to doing Challenges and being picky, and the change to Bobblehead and magazine weight just fixed my hoarding problem. So at the moment I have no compelling reason to sign up.
---
Why would I leave? Added legendary scorch beasts, fixed bugs, nothing happened to negatively affect my gameplay.
---
Good building is the most important overall, and the ability to interact with other players at said building haha
---
I envy you. in my experience the game does everything in its power to make me miserable.
---
anyway, enjoy your server. and make the best out of it, make sure to rack up that semi-infinite ammo.
---
There's also one at Grafton dam, on the side where you spawn before you run over to the greenies. Down by the base on one of the sides where the bridge starts. (Pretty sure it's that bridge, it was a bridge at least).
---
Stay and continue playing adventure mode like I always have.
---
95% of the mats I scrounge/loot get sold to bot vendors, and I really dont care if someone else can collect more - it is irrelevant to my playstyle.
---
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs one west of gilman lumber mill, south west of where the meat week event was, it‚Äôs one of those unmarked locations
---
It's hearing what they want to hear. A lot of the time it was along the lines of 'I would love this in the game, I'd even pay atoms for it.' Meaning, of course, they want it for free as a first choice, but Bethesda ignored that and said 'You'd pay atoms for it? Cool.'
---
Nah you are the problem.  Primarily because you are arrogant enough to think your condescending post is appropriate on any level but also because of the inherent element of entitlement you display.
---
Yeah half the posts here were always "*Why don't they add this?*"
---
Then 3 months later people saying "*Why did they add this?! Nobody asked for this!!*" eeeerm yes they did. Scroll down a bit.
---
I think people just think outrage is the default way to express concerns or unhappiness. Problem is they spent that anger on a fucking pointless camp fridge that didn't matter in the slightest. That was so stupid. Weeks of posts and nasty comments. That and the week when you could get a bonus for wearing an unstoppables outfit. Remember that?
---
This fallout 1st stuff is a genuine reason to be furious but it matterd so much less than it should because people have been crying wolf over a reskinned knife you can buy in the shop.
---
I guarantee somebody at Bethesda has recently used the phrase "Fuck it, they'll complain either way. Just do it."
---
Fallout 1st is the first thing ever that's made me agree with that pile of Bethesda-hating fedora-wearing "*meh this gun doesn't fit the lore because that came out in '72 and the timeline split in blah blah*" circklejerking pricks on r/fallout.
---
Many of these posts are by people who have either:
---
Never bought 76 (that's their right)
---
Did buy it, but didn't like it (that's their right)
---
Have played, and don't want to spend more money on it (that's their right)
---
Or "Karma farmers" who are jumping on the hate bethesda for doing ANYTHING AT ALL bandwagon because it's the fun thing to do now.
---
Totally agree. I'm like, "Dialogue options that matter and depend on stats? And make me actually laugh? Holy fuck I've missed you!"
---
It doesn't have the scale of a Fallout game because it's lower budget but it's pure joy. Here's hoping Microsoft gives them the keys to the kingdom so the sequel can knock it out of the park.
---
I love my premium subscription!
---
Lol you know better than people that actually play because you watched videos! Sorry we didn‚Äôt realize!
---
It's wacky-ness is what made fallout 2 a nice sequel. I liked it I don't know why you even have a problem with that part, same gameplay and expands on the lore in good way. 
---
Also OtW is a spiritual successor to fallout, but it's how you look at it, It doesn't have a lot in common with mass effect other that it is in space and the futuristic armor other than that nothing remotely like mass effect.
---
Q1 2020
---
That is explicitly something people do not want.
---
Ok i feel you. I agree that this game for all its good points is kinda shit. I guess you can say that those who support this perpetuate the cycle and give Bethesda an excuse to continue producing it. But my point with the 'don't spend it' comment was simply if what they r giving  you is crap don't spend money and further perpetuate the problem. I personally still enjoy the game have done a so since the beta. That said the screwups are annoying and they have fixed most of them. But I won't be considering buying the new stuff until it works maybe not at all. What annoys me is that everyone constantly bitches and complains and I suppose they have a right to, but sometime it goes to extremes. If we actively ignore or not facilitate their release of shitty stuff you would think maybe they might change their ways
---
Ooooh look at this guy. He has friends. Mr. Big Shot over here.
---
This fallout 76 game is hot garbage and these IDIOTS have the nerve to offer a $100 subscription to BS, SCAM and LIES.
---
FIX. YOUR. BROKEN. ASS. GAME.
---
Bye?
---
March 31st
---
Breh farming these nukes zones are so easy now with a private server.
---
u/countchappy was the one who owns the domain, also all of his posts regarding the site have been removed
---
I havent subbed yet, but plan to after I finish the outer worlds. Just picked it up after about 6 months. Absolutely loved the game on release. These private servers might be just what I need to return for a bit. I have played on a buddy's private server the past 2 nights and had a blast. Game was great while full of bugs on releass, it's even better now!!
---
So you're either blatantly lying or you still don't know how information works, or can't read what I wrote. I don't watch a video of someone talking and nothing else. They SHOW the game, you know, you can actually see and hear what's going on, you learn about the characters (if there are any in a game), you learn about the plot, the fighting or action, you see how it all works. 
---
____________
---
How do you think movies work? How do you learn anything about them? You're not allowed to play or control them, so where's your logic with that? Or do you understand that you can learn about something without having any control over it yourself? 
---
_____________
---
Since you're "so wise" with your "gameplay experience" tell me what I could be missing that I don't already know because I can't possibly know it without playing it? Tell me that, you know, if you can even come up with anything. Also, obviously you can't counter any actual points I made so you just use the logical fallacy, "U din't pLaY iT so U caN't Hav an OpInIon or KnOw aNyThing AbOut It! EveryThInG u LeaRn is A lIe if U dnt' PLay iT!" 
---
Have any better logic than that? Because it seems someone who hasn't played the game is better at arguing for / against it than you who has played it. I'm not trolling, I'll change my view if you can give actual reasons and logic to defend your position, but you still have yet to do so.
---
Nope, I cant stand it when something I love lies to me.
---
I understand that &amp; it‚Äôs definitely frustrating but matter of the fact is it clearly wasn‚Äôt ready. Many game delay things and yes while they get flak for it they usually turn out pretty good and was worth the wait
---
Spit my coffee out.. thanks for that.
---
I‚Äôm sorry, but Bethesda has been paying attention to this sub through everything. And the prevalent, ‚Äúeat this garbage‚Äù mentality is *why* they‚Äôre pulling this Fallout 1st bs. Until you realize Bethesda is now shitty, and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre doing shitty things. They‚Äôll just make up another excuse, publish a new ‚Äúroadmap‚Äù, and more likely than not a decent chunk of this sub will continue to play and pay. They treat you like this, because you allow it.
---
Day old glowstick of positivity.
---
&gt; I wouldn't go quite as far to say they are lying about inability to integrate it without technical issues though
---
Bethesda has presented us with two wildly different stories about stash boxes before. Both claiming that they wanted to increase the size but that it was a technical limitation,  AND  claiming that the 800 pound stash box size was a pure design consideration.
---
Though it clearly still goes too far to say they lied. Maybe someone just "cracked the code back at base", making it possible to bypass these technical and design restrictions?
---
i do think that the game can be optimised a lot more, i believe too much is being rendered when i am outside because inside buildings everything is fine
---
 Why? How does it effect you?
---
Well, there's also people attacking the game when they should be playing outer worlds
---
This defeatist cynicism saved me 60 bucks, buckaroo. And also a whole heap from microtransactions and subscriptions.
---
So you don't take game ratings seriously? Or you don't know that games in the US that are rated E and M and so forth are rated by people who never even play the games? So yeah, apparently people who don't touch a game CAN judge them, huh, what do you know, even in official settings. Guess you should learn to keep more informed.
---
We all love 76. That's why we are so pissed. We love playing it and Bethesda just wants to take advantage of that fact by putting out new AS items and now the subscription, but give very little actual game content in return. Events aren't content and the biggest content we've gotten was NW and that's even more dead than the base game.
---
I just think at this point that they aren't even trying to keep the game alive and that they are just pushing new ways to charge people until everyone stops playing.
---
You know they will close the game down and then blame us for it right?
---
Is that for real?? Holy shit thats ridiculous. Im really running out of things to do in this game. Been playing for almost a year, might be time for something new
---
$100 is not just for a private server. Ugh why do I even bother. Clearly you know more about the game than people who play the game. You don‚Äôt even understand what‚Äôs included in the subscription lol.
---
See that's a loyal fan and I don't blame you, I love fallout but 76 turned into such a shit show, it was a cash grab, you shouldn't be so blind to just follow through with their shitty ass ploys and schemes. So tell me what did you like about all the fallout games and why did you just except the shit that 76 is, It fucks up the lore, it has no npc's just audio, it has a fucking dragon and they're just trying to suck this game dry before they cancel it and move on to Starfield
---
actually, ive had the opposite experience.  pretty much everywhere i go (ps4) i see fridges, scrap boxes etc.
---
in my experience, if ur ol on console, ur prob already paying for that service (cant access any other ol game (overwtach, eso, pubg,bf), netflix, etc)
---
  console users are more of a "captive audience" b/c less capacity to mods.  it seems to me the uproar is coming more from pc users (esp considering how reddit skews pc)
---
Thank you for this mate, will be trying it out
---
There's quite a stark difference between FO76s private sessions and Minecraft Realms though. Minecraft Realms are accessible by approved players even when the host ISNT online, making it a private server. 
---
If the sessions were 'always on' servers and full pop I don't think there'd be any where near as much backlash.
---
Game was great broken on release. Game is in a great place now and a blast. 
---
Either you are just running your mouth about a game you dont play, or you cant stop playing it, yet keep bashing it... which tool are you?
---
I got three Legendaries with my son the other day at Uranium Fever. It was refreshing to be able to actually get some and not have bloodied or TSE kill everything first.
---
I think it's the price that's triggering most people. The scrap box is the same as ESO's crafting bag but nobody there minds because the sub is actually worth the price.
---
ps4 slim

maybe upgrading to ps4 pro will help, but i have tons of other games and everything goes smooth (rdr2, bfv, skyrim, just to name a few)
---
You tell me about it. My current Camp is on a river, I had to put the foundations higher than I wanted or else I couldn't even build the walls. Also I used one of these staircase plattforms and couldn't place floor decor under it until I used the mat trick. 
---
I spend most of my time working around this nonsense limitations instead of actually building.
---
We even have Nuka soda machines, an on-site masseuse, as well as a great 401k program.
---
The filthy casuals subreddit is the beacon of positivity lately. I used to adore the place, as someone who enjoyed the game despite it‚Äôs unforgivable flaws. But now it just reads like a bootlicker brigade. It is like straight up /r/HailCorporate-worthy shit right now.
---
You can't read. I didn't say it is $100 for a private server, I said someone said it would be fine IF it was $100 for only a private server. You apparently don't even understand English or how to read properly.
---
I guess this part relates to what [otakushinjikun](https://www.reddit.com/user/otakushinjikun/) said earlier in this post, that Adventure mode and Private worlds shouldn't be connected, due to possibility of getting advantages in private world and then carrying them over to Adventure.

r/yourjokebutworse
---
Is he working with Dying Light 2, too (too-do-doo)?
---
I noticed this too. A LOT of ranger outfits....so people are buying it.   
---
  And i get it, ive been waiting for that ranger skin forever, and the atoms that come with it are worth the 1 month subscription alone.
---
  I wouldnt get more than that tho
---
future 
---
Whether I like it or not? I think you misunderstand the situation.
---
I'm a fan of the series and bought 76. I always liked the idea of it existing. But the reality is the execution is abysmal and it's earned its place on the trash heap. I have no desire to see it "go away"; on the contrary, its failure was disappointing.
---
People being harsh with a game you're personally attached to is "medical insanity"? Yikes. I think we can leave it there.
---
Change the sub to $10 and I'd be fine if they charged 700 atoms for the junk box that way everyone could have it and actually start giving the game new content instead of focusing mostly on the AS and I think people would be a lot more fine than we are now.
---
Lol tons have, including myself and most of my friends...  I see them everywhere as well.
---
 Just because you see a bunch of whiny children on reddit on a hate train doesn't mean it's not a popular feature. 
---
 Reddit is a very tiny portion of the playerbase but apparently the whiniest.
---
The emote wheel is unusable at times.
---
What straw man exactly?
---
Have any of ID games had them?
---
"Karma farmers" and "drama seekers"? Have you even seen the posts with the most likes and the replies? A lot are made from F76 players that are legitimately disappointed in the ridiculous 13 dollars/month Fallout Last that gives access to something that was asked for by the community from the start. They turned a single player Fallout 4 into a multiplayer, and then ask money monthly for their mistake? Its incredibly stupid and impossible to defend.
---
i dont know the exact location anymore but try your luck at   
---
the area between  "Belching Betty" and "Relay Tower HG-B7-09"   
---
on the left is a rock wall and there is a huge one.  
---
\*sry for possible misstakes, engl. is not my nativ lamguage ;)
---
NV cultist? Sure I like 1,2 and NV. Also I like Witcher 3, Metro 2033, Metro 2035 and Exodus, I liked Dragon Age origins and awakening, Mass effect 1 and 2 with 3 being slightly disappointed in the ending, Also Cyberpunk 2077 is a game I'm waiting to buy so with outerworlds. Your taste might be shit if you like 76 or even played it my dude
---
Moving on means Bethesda continues to push this BS, though. They probing still will, but we should at least be vocal about it.
---
Exactly, this is the same reason why FO76 fans keep getting their faces shoved in shit too - whether the realize it or not. Bethesda looks at this and says ‚ÄúWell hell, if people accept this behavior of ours, what else will they accept?‚Äù. Other studios see this too and wonder what they can get away with. With Fallout 1st, Bethesda just told EA and Activision to hold their beer.
---
Yet you still have zero evidence.
---
Its become nothing but login, check if my hunting rifle still has that scoping glitch. See its still there turn it off.
---
That goes out sometimes so you have to smack it and shake it super hard.
---
It does affect those who do not buy it. Bethesda decides to sell lazy, crappy content, to see if people will bite. If they don't, they'd have to make GOOD content people WANT. But people do bite on the crap, so why would they EVER try to do better or work harder when they're making bank sitting on their asses laughing at you counting your $100 for emotes and a "private" server? It affects me because I want GOOD Bethesda games like in the past, and every time people buy their lazy sh*t it enables them to keep selling lazy sh*t.
---
Right??? I enjoy the fuck out of being able to do my favorite events again by myself.
---
To say that the majority of the players purchased the content just because you saw many ranger skins is just laughable. You don‚Äôt have the numbers and the way this game is built forces people to gather until they fill up a server. Then a new server is created if needed. So, even if there are only 20-30 people left in the game, you will play in a server full of people with Ranger skins. A perfect environment for whales, but the game is still dead.
---
I'm not going to boycott anything but I'm definitely never pre-ordering from Bethesda anymore
---
Regardless of how I feel about certain "Content Creators" these tools don't even know how to play the game. If you ever watch them try to play, they have shit armor and weapons. They don't understand what perks to pick, and most of all they don't even understand the Lore or story. 
---
Then they sit there and go oh the game is really unbalanced and hard and its a mess. Like WTF seriously!?!??
---
GET DOWN ! THE THOUGHT NAZI IS HERE!!! Im so sorry Mr, he will never say/think or feel like saying that again, please dont report us to the Heich, im sure you can oversee this offense, please we are so sorry, im so sorry, h-have a nice day...OR NIGHT!!! IM NOT RACIST PLS HAVE A NICE NIGHT, oh my god...my family...
---
It's possible for people to enjoy the game and just not buy the subscription. Because yes the subscription is trash, most agree on that but if people like the game then they're gonna play, that doesn't make them pushovers.
---
I have no idea what you are talking about. Fallout 76 is rated M and I don't see no problem with that.
---
While I readily admit the Scrap Box and Tent are Major "Quality of Life" additions, they provide no Tactical or Competitive advantage, so where exactly are you seeing the pay to "Win" in all of this?
---
I have played and still own every Fallout Game since 1998, including all DLCs, and 76 is the first that I didn't pay full price for due to real life events (House Fire) that delayed my purchase, and saved me $20, but I would have purchased it either way, and would not have a different opinion based on $20.
---
I also own &amp; play many other games that cost significantly more than FO76, some of which have $20-$30 DLCs, and cost more than $70 to start with many years ago.
---
I gauge the value of a Video Game on 2 basic things;
---
* How much do I enjoy Playing it? (A)= FO76, is Fallout with friends, and a social aspect that makes everyday a new adventure, I love it!
---
* How many hours of entertainment do I get from the game? (A)= My combined hours of gameplay across all characters is around 2400, with my current investment of $160 (Yes I bought a 1 year subscription), that comes out to about $.06/Hour of entertainment, which seems a bit cheap to me.
---
Well... "Working" at this point is a little generous. Perhaps simply "messing with" is more accurate?
---
 All I can say is the management of this game is amateurish and quite frankly awful
---
No, I don't know better than people who play the game, I just know better than idiots like you who can't use any actual arguments, only the logical fallacy of "u DiDnT plAy iT!"
---
NCR and Caesar‚Äôs Legion years before they existed and retconning the Chinese to have power armor....yay.
---
My man üëäüòé
---
Most of all the whole "Oh Bethesda lied about stash space" is driving me fucking nuts. They didn't lie, they simply did a shit job explaining how this shit works.
---
Bathesda
---
Cool. I‚Äôm going to go play the game I enjoy now. Go back to your hole, troll.
---
That's an empty claim if you can't back it up with logic, evidence, or reason. So tell me, friend. What "quite a bit" of content am I missing out on or not able to know a thing about if I don't pick up a controller? Enlighten me.
---
Where are you getting the player count if you don't mind me asking?
---
I play it. I love it. I bought the premium subscription.
---
Don't really care about your shitty opinion.
---
How many refunded when they realized it was ze bad game though?
---
Enough for Bethesda to stop giving refunds at least.
---
Nice job keeping it civil..
---
It reminds me more of a mod version made for Fallout 4 (with the squished face) than the original NV armor.
---
exciting
---
"We're not planning on doing anything about it."
---
This sub is one of the most negative entitled gaming subs I've ever seen. It's obvious this person is new here.
---
Done
---
Awesome, use another logical fallacy to admit you can't argue your losing position. I'm going to go play an actually GOOD game. Enjoy going back to your hole troll (well, a hole would be more fun to live in than playing Fallout 76, that's for sure).
---
You should visit the Dragon Age sub. Nothing but love and positivity (and a bit of healthy anxiety, when talking about the upcoming installment).
---
Yup. I got banned recently for DARING to criticize the game. Fuck that sub!
---
I don't agree. The greedy company should see that this is not okay. If even their biggest fans are outraged, Bethesda should see that, or it will make things even worse, for you included, one of the few that still enjoy the game.
---
Answer: we‚Äôre sorry to hear above your loss please insert another payment of $13 and we‚Äôll try our Best to resolve the issue
---
Which is why my expectations are sky high
---
What are you talking about? I didn't say a single thing about what Fallout 76 is rated. I was telling you how games in general in the US get their rating. And it's not from anyone playing the game, it's from people viewing a set presentation made by the game developer or publisher, and they rate the game based on that, or did you not know that?
---
Where have you been for the last couple of months?
---
Should have went for volume with cosmetics anyway. It costs them hardly anything to provide (no variable costs) so if they made them cheaper people probably would have bought more. I only used free atoms because I thought they would rebalance the prices down, instead they gouged prices worst and I went into wait until I knew what items I wanted to get. Unfortunately while I was waiting the game kept getting worse! Ended up never buying anything.
---
I have spent hundreds on cosmetics for some of my favorite games, particularly for games that go for more of a volume price. When one item I may use for a week costs ten bucks it shakes me out of it... at a lower price I buy twenty of them. I guess I am not a big enoughh whale for them.
---
Eh, i made a reddit account just to let my Frustration out After i had so much fun the past couple of weeks, excited for the new update, i googled what it was about and i was mad.
---
The only thing that made me uninstall the game is that unlimited scrap box. Its clearly pay-2-win. 
---
Survival, my favourite mode with tons of unique and fun memories will never happen again, is gone now too. They keep making the game worse and now i gave up. 
---
They wont stop Messing up, i learned that yesterday.
---
Some games scammed me before, this will be the Last one. Gaming went to shit. 
---
For everyone defending this; youre part of the problem. Do what u wish with that Information.
---
I did my part. Uninstalled it even though i was eager to get to level 100 since im 94 now. Now i know people will get every loot they want and basically have infinite ammo if you farm a few days.
---
I'd rather pay 20 dollars for a DLC than monthly for a wannabe MMO.
---
Its clearly pay2win now. 
---
Even if i bought it, it would be less fun. Private worlds where u can find everything u want is cheating. Having waaay less item management is cheating. Cheating isnt fun to me, so its less fun no Matter what. 
---
Its just frustrating.
---
I and almost all my friends bought it and almost everyone I see in game now has a ranger outfit on.
---
 I think you would be quite surprised how many people actually bought it.
---
 I'm sorry it doesn't fit your hateful narrative.
---
if only it was true
---
I think Bethesda have a bit of a problem. Look at their recent big published games--Fallout 76, Rage 2 and Wolfenstein: Youngblood. They've all largely tanked. Their next big one is Doom: Eternal which isn't out until next year sometime. I can't help but wonder if stuff like Fallout First is showing that Bethesda have a cash flow problem and are desperate to get some funds in?
---
it's a conspiracy to defraud consumers any way you cut it, this game is like salmonella on lettuce
---
I don‚Äôt think that word means what you think it does, considering I am done arguing. Again you don‚Äôt play the game. We all do and we all enjoy it. You‚Äôve based your opinions on click bait YouTube reviews and telling people who play it that they are wrong. You aren‚Äôt interested in an actual discussion. You are just trying to spread your own anger. No thanks. Respond with whatever snark you want now so that you can have the last word. I know that‚Äôs all you really want. Have a good day.
---
I feel like it's more like 10,000 angry complains come in 1 percent are threats and the receiving end makes it out that 99 percent were threats and ignore everything else.  
---
So people get ignored and that gets more people angry and they cycle gets worse
---
never got issues with the wheels, except that it is a bit annoying to use sometimes 
---
the quick swap weapon bothers me a lot though, sometimes when im fighting a group of feral ghouls i run out of ammo and wanna switch weapons quickly, but then the game freezes for a second and after that im surrounded by the ghouls cuz i couldnt do shit
---
&gt; Y‚Äôall realise your wasting your life collecting things that aren‚Äôt even real.
---
Yeah.  We could be playing some other game, doing exactly the same thing.  Or increasing the sum of human knowledge by posting boring things on Reddit.
---
What kind of mental illness do you have to have to go around telling people not to do what they want to do?
---
FO4 was my first FO game, and I love it. If you're telling me that's a shit version i really need to tap into prior games.
---
Fallout 76 is a skinner box designed to take advantage of people's addictive nature. It only requires logging out for a day or two to break the habit.
---
I want an actual discussion, you're the one who doesn't. I'm not going to call you an idiot for defending a game you like, I called you one for not having any actual defenses for it and saying I'm wrong. You also haven't countered a single claim of mine, you just use the logical fallacy of, "U don't play, bye bye." So yeah. Nice job keeping it civil.
---
tool
---
&gt; People are actually making the argument that they are entitled to the private servers for free. I'm not implying, I'm quoting. 
---
Sick burn lol
---
That's not even remotely funny.
---
If you took your time to check their post history, you'll notice most of them don't even play the game. They play Minecraft of Battlefield 5 or something like that. One guy in particular was playing Anthem and that was a good laugh
---
This is exactly how I feel...I really enjoy the game and the world. I love seeing other players and their camps and playing with my friends and making new ones too...
---
I really don't want this game to die. I've defended it since beta because I saw what it could be. And they just don't seem to get it...
---
And I was excited about private servers. Especially since I'm levelling a new character and it makes it impossible to go to some place (whitesprings anyone?) Because 100+ level characters up the enemy spawn levels to 60+. I can't even play the Halloween event. But what I also wanted on a private server was the ability to control who was on it with me...and Beth completely took that away ? I mean it makes no sense...
---
I knew it was pushed back...just didnt bother to check till when. But i noticed people keep posting about how far it was pushed back lately.
---
Oof
---
"I keep stabbing this rat but im doing 0 damage"
---
Gambling addiction.
---
Well do they cone to this subreddit and pretend they know all about the game and make shitposts like you are doing now?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty positive this was a toxic subreddit, there was so much toxicity the community divided and filthy casuals subreddit was setup for people to just talk about the fun they were having. This subreddit has NOT been a bacon of Norwal midnight positivity, don‚Äôt forget, beta and launch we‚Äôre a mega disaster, but here‚Äôs something i still like the game and will play again
---
There‚Äôs 3 versions. Probably skins. The other 2 have armor on the outside of the coat. There‚Äôs 1 stripe and 2 stripe armored. Peep the data mine.
---
You can't change anybody's view in an angry Reddit thread.  Folks just needed to know that you've never played the game, so they can have that in context when reading your stuff.
---
a candle in fog of positivity
---
Ever visited the Ark subs?
---
Damn. I know it‚Äôs Bethesda, but I‚Äôm kind of surprised the scrap box is a service rather than an perpetual utility item (like the refrigerator).
---
Bad Bot.
---
I know about this, but how is this related to "the coat is bad"?
---
I play with two friends. It's fun to catch up with them, run around fighting, do some quests once in a while. When they aren't on, I wander around the world exploring, taking pictures, admiring the scenery. I work on my camp a lot. 
---
Similar to ESO, I look at this game as something I use to unwind, so I don't really expect much from it. I get home from work and I have a couple of hours to kill...why not spend them running around a pretty world, beating on stuff, listening to music? If it's a weekend and I can spend more time on a game, FO76 definitely isn't my first choice. I can play something like Ark/7 Days/etc. all day long, but this wouldn't hold my attention in the same way. This game is just a way to chill out between cooking dinner and going to bed - fun enough to help me relax, simple enough to keep me from getting totally sucked in and staying up too late.
---
If you‚Äôre going to be so negative then quit the game it isn‚Äôt hard. There‚Äôs zero reason for you to be an ass on my post. As I said I know the points that need to be made are being made and by far more mature people than you. 
---
Also if you‚Äôre going to be so incredibly one sided then at least get your facts right. All future content being free? They never said that. I‚Äôll tell you right now it‚Äôs better to have some sense of understanding for why things are than to be someone who just shits on the game but still spends all their time playing it.
---
5 and 12, and yea sadly it is.
---
I bought Fallout 76, I like some parts of it, I don't want to spend anything more on it, since it was full priced Fallout 4 reskin anyway, and who the hell cares about karma, and its not fun to hate on Bethesda, its annoying that it got this far with the greed and lies.
---
same
---
Never once did I say it was bad to enjoy the game, in fact I've defended people who even paid for the crap subscription service because they just really liked the playstyle it allowed for. What I won't defend are ignorant people that can't defend why they like a game and can't counter any of my points while only using the logical fallacy "u didn't play it so u can't hav an opinion." 
---
I'm willing to have an actual discussion and listen to your points. You just aren't willing to accept someone who hasn't played the game actually does know about it. I don't want "the last word" I want reasons, logic, evidence, something on why you're defending it. And I'm still waiting, but obviously you have nothing good to say about the game or any actual way of defending it.
---
Well they can change anything in game, it's in the agreement.
---
I still play and I bought the subscription. Why?  Because I love the game, simple as that.
---
Though I won't really get to enjoy until I'm done with Outer Worlds.
---
Lol the lawsuits, I swear some people don't live in the real world.
---
I haven't played since early spring ( don't really game in the summer). I just came back to check it out. I see that there is a subscription service for private servers. " oh that's all right I guess, if people are into that sort of thing" 
---
Wait a second,  sub service also gives Infinite stach  and turns out the private server is not actually private just a reused empty world. 
---
Wtf, little disappointed, guess I'll just move on and make room for somthing else on my console.
---
jim gaffigan the comedian????? what does he have to do with fallout, and why did pete tag him??
---
The coat has more detail (pockets, canteen,etc) in those versions. As well as on whats under it and over it?
---
atoms
---
Good for you, enjoy your bugged scrap box and non-private servers! I am not paying a subscription to play a single player game with a massive amount of bugs. And again, what I think, or you and few of your friends think is irrelevant. What matters is what the community thinks. And they are outraged.
---
It's not a bug, it's a feature!
---
Jet
---
Then why did you leave a comment?
---
I like what you're doing, I hope your GoFundMe page gets more attention
---
Going by Bethesda current record, it would be beyond naive to expect a perfect (let's be real, even bug free) update. 
---
I'm not quite convinced anything is worthwhile making a return to the game now. Garbage business practices cannot be supported in any way and fallout 76 has been a perfect example of some really text book shoddy business practices. Perhaps Wastelanders will be just what the game needs, but I don't think I'm the only one thinking it's a little too late, a little too much faith down the drain, you know?
---
Still, at its core it was a good game, despite everything. However for me personally, the enchantment is very much lifted
---
I said I like *this* game though. I'm not playing it because of some misplaced FNV loyalty. It's a pleasant experience being in the massive game world they've created and very diverse in different regions. I've just run out of things to do after a lot of time in-game.
---
I liked the others too (haven't played BoS or tactics) but I can play this for hours virtually with no bugs at all. Then I'll play tomorrow and have minor issues maybe.
---
It's a grind to get the very, very best late-game items but what game isn't when you want those items?
---
Don‚Äôt think you can buy them anymore
---
More like thr fleshlight of negativity.
---
A cheap hooker and some blow
---
I was agreeing with you, not asking a question.
---
The riot gear actually has region appropriate letters on it, and Roman armor existed loooooong before Caesar was even born. The chinese could of captured the power armor and tinkered with it, it's not uncommon to see different sides use captured material from the other, hell during ww2 divisions like the 83rd Infantry Division which had the nickname Rag Tag Circus due to the amount of captured German vehicles and equipment they used.
---
Estimated time of arrival
---
Plot twist... instead of a dedicated form... people pay to be redirected to this subreddit :D
---
Yeah, it's like people have never heard of false advertisement before, or companies being sued for liable after lying constantly.... that never happens....
---
If they don't post in this subreddit, doesn't mean they don't play the game. I owned the game for months and had little reason to post on this subreddit so far. But I want the game to get better, not worse, and this is massive move in the wrong direction, and so here I am for a while. I can't believe I even defended the game when I said I bought it on discord in the past couple of weeks.
---
Well, they've been lying for years now. There's a reason why sweet little lies became Todd's theme song
---
i've spent it on the Outer Worlds... and still have some left.
---
I say suspect because I‚Äôm not a freaking mind reader. The reason a lot of them gave for not wanting multiplayer was that it would take away from other things, like the story, which absolutely happened here. Did they see other things? Did they see the ridiculous monetization coming? I don‚Äôt know. I will never know. So I can only suspect.
---
You need to chill out.
---
Yes but that's the same as in NV, there is this NCR version with less details and the Riot Gear from Lonesome Road.
---
Outer World
---
Here's the problem with this sub. 
---
It doesn't know what it's talking about. You think a $13/month private server + additional premium currency and some extras was designed to satisfy whales?  You think someone shelling out 100 bucks a year is classified as a whale? 
---
This subscription is not whale bait in any way shape or form. The mere fact that's it's heavily incentivized with premium currency, utility items and extras is a dead give away. 
---
This subscription is far more likely directed at the occasional spender. Someone who maybe drops 10-15 bucks occasionally on the AS. 
---
Now you're hooking them for a moderate amount on a consistent basis, instead of sporadically and unpredictably. 
---
If this service was targeted at whales it would have been barebones, and cost significantly more, because as whales, they'd buy it regardless. 
---
They wouldn't have incentiveized it with highly requested extras.
---
Spent a portion of that already on a Sennheiser HD 58X.
---
I think we're long, long past the point of Bethesda being "afraid" of this game's future. Everything they're doing is just to desperately cling to whatever player base they have to recoup losses. There is no real future for this game, and they know it... They've known it since launch...
---
That is the plus, no matter what until the servers die and the fires go out, I'll still be in the wasteland!
---
Why is every post taking about this sub being a vocal minority, mentioning a fraction less than half that bought the pass?
---
Don't get me wrong, any sub will only be a small portion of the player base, but if you are going to use your in game experience to state something, that in game experience shouldn't be contradictory to what you're saying. Saying a third of the people bought it, is saying that a minority of the people bought it. That's not even including the people that aren't playing anymore because of it.
---
Some phsyco and ultra jet.
---
I find it hilarious you are judging the community on a small handful of whiny little karma whores on reddit.
---
 I guarantee you they cleaned house with this premium subscription. The majority of players I see including all of my server hops have the subscription.
---
 So have fun with your imaginary outrage.
---
thank you for your answer.
---
Skyrim was when they lost me
---
indeed. I dusted off my Xbone and paid for a 3 month pass for ¬£15. Gonna live inside Outer Worlds then Gears 5 etc :D
---
Absolutely true. However, having only two mods that only seem to come online/post every couple of weeks at most is lacking quite a bit of oversight.
---
Sorry dude I have to disagree
---
With you, this sub is at times very toxic , theres a lot of insults thrown at members that have opinions that go against the vocal majority. I scrolled down a bit on here and it wasn't long before I saw the first insults thrown at folks who really don't deserve it, just for having a more forgiving attitude to Bethestas handling of the game.
---
I'm not suggesting for one second that all here are quick with scorn, I know there are many fantastic people on here that are as you described. But unfortunately it seems there is more hate that love for bethesta here, i like to think it's just the negative people shouting longest and loudest so that's what get seen most.
---
Same, and with a CAMP at max budget the atoms don‚Äôt really do much now.
---
Pc version of Red dead redemption 2 and the rest on beer.
---
Strange, I have not DC'd of crashed once since the update, neither have any of my friends, but then we have been spending all of our time on Private worlds, which seem to run a lot smoother.
---
What do you define as a socialistic economic system? Do you define certain European nations as being socialistic?
---
Moving away from that, do you know the art created under the USSR? Or what about the completely free modding and works of art created in games like Minecraft and Skyrim?
---
Letting them know why their sales fall off a cliff in hopes they do not do this to the next game they release. They will make some increment of money off of this, I want them to see the public ire they also got. If I did not want to play Bethesda games I would ghost on out of here, I really do want to play, but they are breaking the game in my opinion. It may takes years for them to see it in the bean counters room but hopefully they have a public relations person that is letting them know this is a dumb way to operate.
---
I am out of Fallout 76, they do this again I am out of their company for life. Too many options for my money and time. There are a lot of game companies I will not bother buying from. At best I willnpick them up off the discount rack after a year of solid reviews and youtube videos showing me it may be worth a spin. 
---
Fawning over Bethesda pissing all over you will not give them useful data (other than to piss on you more). There may come a moment where they go too far even for you, then tou may wish you encouraged them to hit the brakes now, or even earlier up the slippery slope.
---
Nah I checked your post history and I can tell that you play. There are these fuckers out there that's never bothered about the game till yesterday
---
That photo was from info released a week or two ago about wastelanders if I remember correctly. I'm assuming it's a new creature being added to the game.
---
The Outer Worlds
---
They always do BS like this, remember all the revived bugs?
---
It has but haven't you gotten or dlc and updates free so far? Wastelanders where it really counts
---
Basically, you love them, but they don't love you. I'm not saying this to judge you, but apparently Bethesda has a very different idea about basically everything compared to their customers. Yes, they make or rather used to make some one of a kind games, but recently they have started to focus on min-maxing their effort/money ratio.
---
The biggest problem with the subscription service is that it changes the balance of the game due to the unlimited scrap storage. Of course, nowadays almost everyone has the good stuff as there was never any proper balance in the game and Bethesda always fucks it up, but if this would have come earlier then it would be a lot more visible. The private server implementation is also horrendous.
---
That's false. People have changed opinions in "angry reddit threads" so unless you can provide evidence to the contrary that's an empty claim. Also, the anger I have isn't directed towards anyone playing the game, it's towards the company itself for their greed and the people defending the game with no logic or reason. If you love the game, good, that's awesome, enjoy it, I never once said someone shouldn't enjoy it. But even enjoying it you should be able to accept it's a poorly done game. 
---
I mention I haven't played the game because of ignorant people like you who think that means anything. I am not hiding a single thing, because regardless of not playing it I have actual arguments that use logic, reason, and FACTS about the game, yeah, did you know that you can learn about a game you've never played? Surprising, isn't it? It's funny how I haven't played the game but can more coherently argue for / against it than people like you who have played it and only use logical fallacies like "u DiDnT pLay tHe GaMe sO u dNt mAttEr!"
---
&gt; Granted, it could have spawned before, though. 
---
AFIAK legendary scorchbeasts didn't exist before this patch.
---
All I was saying is that there is more detail on those? 
---
That the coat and armor looks better than this version. 
---
Not sure what you‚Äôre going on about.
---
Warframe, or just eat it all.
---
Gamepass is pc too, plus Xbox has millions of players?
---
&gt; "Look, there‚Äôs a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we‚Äôre going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you‚Äôre getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I‚Äôm getting that stuff for free. That feels right."  
---
&gt;"Will it be possible to buy non-cosmetic items, say, a legendary minigun, with microtransactions?"  
---
&gt;#"[No. Only Cosmetic.](https://twitter.com/dcdeacon/status/1032589221398282241)"
---
You are going to be incredibly disappointed.
---
I guess no more than the people slaughtered by capitalist sponsored death squads because they voted for anti-capitalist leaders around the world.
---
Two words, Vault raid
---
Wait so your telling me people that loved the game and were here from day one and now are angry are not fans???? Well your not a fan if you think that your not even an intellegent human being if you stand behind that statement. Your whole post is contradictory your hate is justified but dont do it here wtf please go kick rocks. I love this game and most of us do thats why we are so mad.
---
Oh look, it's one of *these* posts.
---
Everyone needs to quit acting like they were given a choice "play or quit" because nothing in the game has changed from how it was last week save for people doing a fun new dance
---
Have any proof or reasons it's a "shitpost" or is that just another empty claim of yours based on more logical fallacies? Shitposts don't use logic, reasons, or facts like I've used. You still haven't actually responded to my arguments. Why is that? Maybe because you can't.
---
My apologies for misconstruing.
---
Dude! You totally trolled them! Lol! They are finished!
---
I'm going to get run out of town by an angry mob, but there's some pretty cool stuff in there. Am I seeing a paint job for scout armor?
---
40% of my 25 characters are Rangers now.
---
Of course they care, they want players to pay for this every month.  If the junk is gone forever, nobody will pay and they will likely be forced to close the game completely.
---
&gt;I just... Alot of this is Zenimax also. The publisher.
---
Actually Bethesda aren't beholden to Zenimax‚Ä¶ It was created by Bethsda themselves.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax\_Media#History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media#History)
---
ZeniMax was founded in 1999 by [Bethesda Softworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethesda_Softworks) founder [Christopher Weaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Weaver) and [Robert A. Altman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_A._Altman).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media#cite_note-5) It was established as a successor to Media Technology Limited, Bethesda's parent company at the time. 
---
Weaver brought Altman on board as CEO, contributing his stock in Bethesda Softworks so that the new shell company, named ZeniMax Media, would be able to obtain funding. Weaver served initially as Chief Technology Officer of the company from 1999‚Äì2002, then moved to a non-operational role in 2002. Weaver filed a lawsuit against ZeniMax in 2002 for breach of contract, claiming he was owed US$1.2 million in severance pay.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media#cite_note-escapist-6) In the end the case was resolved out of court. Although still the largest shareholder, Weaver no longer had any day-to-day responsibilities with Zenimax. 
---
In 2004, ZeniMax  acquired the [*Fallout*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_(series)) franchise from [Interplay Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Entertainment).[\[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media#cite_note-7) Bethesda's [Todd Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Howard_(video_game_designer)) said in January 2007 that "We started work on [*Fallout 3*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_3) in late 2004 with a few people. We only had about 10 people on it until [*Oblivion*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion) wrapped (...)".[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeniMax_Media#cite_note-8) *Fallout 3* was released in October 2008.
---
Yeah, and we should be able to sue people who write bad books, and start a class action suit against Netflix because some of their shows are bad.
---
That 1% tends to be much louder than that 99%
---
And that 99% gets mixed in with the rest because at some point while your life is being threatened another complaint just gets tossed on the pile.
---
I agree completely. After playing on a friend‚Äôs private server yesterday I can see the value in that. The game performs a lot better with fewer people in the world. If they had a subscription that was just private servers I‚Äôd buy it, add in the Atoms and I‚Äôd easily pay what they‚Äôre asking now. 
---
The utility stuff has put me off though. That stuff should be available to everybody for free. At least to existing players who have stuck with the game and been told for a year that more inventory space just wasn‚Äôt possible. 
---
I feel like if I give them my money for this, I‚Äôm telling them I want more paid utilities‚Äîso I‚Äôm not doing it. At least not for now. After some more real content comes out and if they find a way to make this right, then maybe.
---
There was *absolutely* a large part of the player base that didn‚Äôt want multiplayer. One common reason I heard was that it would take away from the single player aspect of things (and holy shit, it did). I wonder how many of them knew the monetization schemes would come with it, though? These discussions went back to the days of Oblivion, possibly before it, where this ‚Äúgames as a service‚Äù bullshit didn‚Äôt exist yet.
---
Do you play the game still?
---
Half an ounce and some hash
---
Got any proof that I'm wrong?
---
mmkkayy
---
Go find some other games to shit all over, have never played, that you've only watched Youtube videos on - but somehow are an expert.
---
You keep doing you.  Go be angry.  You're great at that.
---
The ones that look 15 to me are those that keep weeping to get some stuff for free.
---
So I guess you don‚Äôt play any more?
---
Not necessarily. If everyone who hates it just puts it down and walks away, one of two things will happen:
---
A) enough people will walk away, denying Bethesda the income they need to support this type of practice
---
B) enough people who are just playing the game and spending money on it because they enjoy it will remain, keeping the game alive so they can play it, while the people who walked away can find something that they do enjoy. Everyone does what they like doing and go on about their merry way. It‚Äôs like that guy in the Matrix who decided he liked being in the matrix and being a slave to the system better than being in the real world
---
People started crying out before the usual bugs where known
---
They don't care. Honestly, all of reddit could boycott this game and it would be a drop in the bucket. All they care about is the people who will continue to pay them money. If you're not paying, they don't give a single crap about you
---
Guess you've never checked out LoL sub, or WoW sub then. LMAO
---
Have you ever played Fallout New Vegas (FNV)?
---
These things are from FNV and resemble those items I named.
---
The version we have now is the NCR version while those you say that have better details were from a DLC.
---
My point is the level of detail of the one we have now basically do not differ much from what you'd find in NV but some of the detail is a little bit off.
---
Wouldnt even matter when they release it. It will be broken and unfinished just like the game still is, and like private servers are.
---
There is plenty of content.  I still have not done everything in the game and I've been playing since release.  Most people who say they have run out of things to do, have play time in the hundreds of hours.  That doesn't sound like "no content"
---
And there are NPCs, not a lot, but we have NPCs.  I don't know where people got the idea that an NPC has to be human, but between characters like Biv, the grafton mayor, the scout leaders etc yes - we have NPCs.
---
And the private servers or sessions are private enough - no one else is on there.  The only other people who can join are my friends, and I'm the kind of person that only has ACTUAL FRIENDS in my friend list and not every jo-shmo I encounted once in a game. 
---
And nothing has been removed from my junk stash and the server stability has been better for me in some time, but that could also just be the actual work they've been doing on server stability. 
---
The game is fine if you just pay for the base game.  For the price it's being offered at now, there is a ton of content to do.  You don't need the fridge.  You don't need the scrap box, we did just fine for a whole year without it expecially after they increased the stash limit.  I actually agreed with people about the line being crossed with some of the items, but with the amount of attacks and people overblowing it as P2W (for christ sake I've seen games where the best weapons are behind paywalls and those give you actual measurable advantages over other players) - the amount of attacking people are doing, is actually driving me to WANT to defend and support bethesda.  Especially when I see people who never even posted on this board before come on here and start attacking it.
---
4k people on this sub rn... who are you kidding? This is less than 1% of the games total player base. People here need to realize that this subreddit is in no way a representation of the player base as a whole... Stop thinking you're the majority
---
Place has been kiss ass people that forgive too easy and then keep getting fked. I rented it and didn‚Äôt buy. Bump tht
---
So you don‚Äôt have the game installed right?  Why are you posting here since the game sucks and you don‚Äôt have it installed?
---
Influx of new players? This is plain delusional.
---
Yup, you are great at being an angry troll with no logic in their words, who can't even win an argument about a game you've played against someone who hasn't played it. Enjoy the crap game!
---
Fallout 2nd, welcome to the club...
---
The game has gotten near universal negative reactions. It‚Äôs not like reddit is some outlier about a game people love.
---
So to you video game antics are on par with racist comments? Gotcha. smh
---
Wow I just checked it out it's got post if you say anything negative you're banned for 30 days wtf.
---
Yeah see, that‚Äôs cool and all. And I appreciate your reply, but could you try to make it would like... idunno maybe 20% less like propaganda? They‚Äôre starting to catch on. 
---
I‚Äôm joking. Everyone chill.
---
I've tried to stick with this game but my patience reached it's breaking point and I won't be playing anymore
---
But but but but you didn't /s it! What are we suppose to figure it out on our own or something?!
---
Ever heard the saying "No such thing as bad publicity?" Fo76 is trending and it isn't due to advertising.
---
I actully preordered the game, hevaly enjoyed it and i still do to this day, hell i even bought fallot 1st
---
Lol no I haven't
---
Pretty much. Rush dailies/weeklies then go play another game.
---
In hindsight, yeah. It was kinda just hope eventually it might get better. Shame
---
Yea you can argue how much it gives you, but point is it gives access to a server I cant go and ability to do more than I can. Don't exactly "win' over me, but the game is a better version than I can't get without paying.
---
I can understand that, I think newer fans are going to have an easier time handling this a little better. 
---
The best way to understand the issues would be to play Fallout 4, Fallout: New Vegas or Fallout 3, where you would be able to tell that charging for features that have been delivered in past games for a lot less is a slap in the face a bit. The ideology for those games is to go slow and enjoy the world, uncover mysteries and weapons and slowly push yourself to travel further after leveling and acquiring the means to deal with higher ranked enemies. Where FO76 is a shove out of a vault and you‚Äôre encouraged to push the bounds of travel before being able.
---
We‚Äôre in the rare statistics in this sub for not being part of the younger crowd here, I think it‚Äôs awesome that you‚Äôve taken up gaming after this time and I hope this doesn‚Äôt encourage you to stop, for me it‚Äôs a great hobby and stress reliever. A lot has changed in the industry since N64, some for better and some for worse. I don‚Äôt think things are going to change that much for people who continue playing who decide not to spend extra money on this membership. It can‚Äôt be promised though, there‚Äôs already ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù type purchases in the Atomic Shop. So depending on how that goes, it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to see players rebelling and attacking others in lobbies to a further extent than I have seen in lobbies currently. PVP is mildly inconvenient in this game compared to other MMOs.
---
Fallout 76 is a bit loose for me. I thought the bag thing was dodgy corporate practice and I don't buy into companies that lie to their consumers. I won't be buying another Bethesda product until massive changes are made.
---
If you really need a working definition of an economy under socialistic rule, look no further to the inevitable result in the USSR. And every European nation uses capitalism as a baseline for prosperity as far I know, so we can move on from there. Even China recognized that free enterprise (albeit with government assistance) achieves their aims far better than the system they employed before.
---
I am well aware of the several works produced under USSR but everyone who lived under those rulesets much preferred the capitalism of the West, including East-European nations, where prosperity AND artistic form was expressed. Look no further than the Gulag Archipelago, a stunning work of critique and art produced under the communistic/socialistic rule. 
---
This goes back to the self-interest factor, people want to express themselves and will always try to do so, it just happens it is better under a nation that recognizes that self-interest and rewards it. Regarding free modding, people do it because they want to, either to practice their skill set, build their portfolio or just contribute in general. That is still self-interest, it is driven from the person itself.. Not an expectation from the state that mandated it was "for common good the society'. A mantra, they always have to resort to with increasing authoritarian measures to enforce. See actual history for multitude of proof.
---
If you want sources, I suggest you trace the ones used in this [wikipedia page.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_socialism) There's some interesting studies and facts to uncover regarding how socialism, whilst ideal and wishful thinking at its best, never leads to the desired results.
---
However, we've strayed from this subreddit's topic and intent far enough. I wish you good day, fellow internet citizen.
---
Could you point out for me where in my post I said anything about whether or not anyone is a fan?
---
i‚Äôm not gonna buy fallout 1st, and i‚Äôm still gonna play, most people here can‚Äôt afford to delete their characters with the game.
---
Yeah, I have. It's the same thing we used to say at launch to defend the game, and it turned out to be a disaster - both financially and technically.
---
Thats a whole lot of words just to say you can't refute any of it. Honestly people you are pathetic, you stink of desperation.
---
stable servers were implied as a functioning game. private servers being paid is fine. STABLE servers should be available for everyone that bought the game.
---
Nope, it's a great game because it's a great game. Good troll though.
---
Show me where I said that.  I can dislike both
---
Slippery slope is problematic i.e. a logical error if there is no evidence just used as a "jump" in reasoning, but when that kind of behavior is expected (based on evidence), because that's the way a system behaves then there is no error in the reasoning.
---
I also had more faith in this game at the beginning, oh, well.
---
I'm buying it Day One even though I still have no idea what the fuck it's about lol
---
Might be a bit harsh to say that. People have wanted a multiplayer or even remember posts asking for an MMO fallout ever since  fallout 3 released. Obsidian was even half way done apparently with an isometric 3d MMO before Bethesda finished aquiring all the rights. I won't lie, I myself wanted this game, but I just wanted it better too.
---
&gt;Then he got an idea! An awful idea! The Todd got a wonderful, awful idea!"  
---
&gt;"I know just what to do!" Pete Hines laughed in the throat.  
---
&gt;And he a made a play to lose scrapbox.   
---
&gt;And they chuckled, and clucked, "What a great Zenimax trick!"  
---
&gt;"With this pay to lose scrapbox, the profits will roll in quick!"
---
Excerpted from *How the Zenimax stole Bethesda*
---
this.
---
It may be trending online, but I highly doubt more people are buying, watching or playing a game when all they hear is bad publicity.
---
The game is broken.
---
A lot of content is locked behind microtransactions.
---
Microtransactions aren't just cosmetic.
---
Wastelanders got delayed.
---
QoL improvements take ages to be implemented.
---
Talking personally, I LOVE the game (or its idea, I don't really know anymore) and that's why I'm okay with the hate. Because people don't hate the game, they hate Bethesda. The company took what could be the best Fallout, and made something with just money in mind, and continued milking it in the most shitty way.
---
Things they could have done: first, launch it a year later, less buggy and with NPCs (probably didn't fit in their corporate schedule); second, dedicate more resources to fix the mess (probably didn't find it worthy); third, stayed fucking away from microtransactions, and sell dlcs, which is a much more honest model and could have very well supported the game I think.
---
Like am not happy about a subscription service in a game that doesn't offer anything new either but what there is actually false ?
---
I'd like my legendary bloodied minigun please
---
It's probably the server then I don't personally play on PS4 but I have one. It could be your internet.
---
They buried fallout 4 in a pet cemetery.....then fallout 4 returns as fallout 76. You know the rest
---
This was my exact experience last week. It had been quite a while since my last time playing the game. I went around, sold my stuff to vendors, visited player vendors, walked around some more. I went 45 minutes without shooting anything. This is a shooting game. There's nothing new, no new content. I have picked up destiny 2 again recently, and while it's grindy, at least there's always an event going on, or consistent spawns, or new quests for exotics. There's always something to do. Boredom hasn't been anything I've worried about. I'm bored every time I play 76. I've got good weapons, I've got good armor, but there's nothing to use them on.
---
I am not angry at all.  :)  
---
Didn't you know that nobody ever actually "wins" when arguing over the Internet with a rando?  
---
I'm sure there is a Youtube video you can watch that would explain that to you.  Happy hunting!
---
And plenty of bootlicking!
---
Sorry who are you?
---
lol stop kidding yourselves, they killed the game. r/outerworlds
---
I like it, catchy name ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•
---
As if no game without microtransactions continues to be updated after launch.
---
Believe what you want, this is very much an actively used form of viral marketing. They already have your money. Viewership is everything
---
Compared to the general view of this game, this sub IS positive. That is kind of the point, this game is such a laughing stock even with the criticism in this sub it is one of the few positive areas about this game.
---
We already saw Zenimax/Bethesda's other monetization in ESO. $50 to access a bank anywhere. Pretty ridiculous. I just compare F76 to ESO and say "it could be worse, at least we can farm atoms in this game and nothing is as expensive as that" Besides, this game is close to how Fallout 4 plays. ESO has nothing in common with other Elders scrolls games
---
Thank you for your input, Todd.
---
Coming up next: Fallout Premium Patching - only for subscribers.
---
And you can‚Äôt rejoin if the server is full, even if you made it originally!
---
‚ÄòA lot of money‚Äô
---
That's what I was thinking. A stack of 10,000 steel is the same as a stack of 10 right? Multiple unique items would be the issue.
---
When an enemy spawns that's to be a legendary it first starts as a crowned and then upgrades to a legendary. If the server is lagging or other issues the upgrading takes a few seconds to maybe a minute.
---
same can be said to you "Sorry Who are you?" If you dont have anything constructive to say then dont comment everyone has the right to express themselves with having to deal with neckbeards in their parents basements saying "bye" its childish and ignorant.
---
Buhbye, have fun with your cute 20 hour game.
---
what platform lmao
---
I swear if they were to do this I‚Äôd buy 3 months of subscription on the spot cause it is a good deal if you really think about it on the atoms alone I just don‚Äôt support P2W elements behind a paywall so I won‚Äôt buy it.
---
I've played the game and everything they said is right and defending Fallout 76 is the most bootlicking nonsense I've ever seen. It's a flop, a failure, and as an experiment I hope it shows them to stay out of the multiplayer field until they bring something worth sharing.
---
My GF and I each have an Xbox and copy of the game. Makes it easy to transfer things.
---
ID is not really ID anymore though? Aren‚Äôt all the principles gone and it‚Äôs just a name now?
---
Yeah I know that. But these never mutated into legendaries and I let them live for a good five minutes.
---
what they're doing with fallout 1st is introduce it to the players and then stick the player's money in their pocket and laugh
---
Yea but thats convenience. ESO gives all DLC for free for the same price/mo. I really enjoy ESO. I think FO76 is garbage in comparison but thats just me.
---
Just fucking quit if you don't like it. Crying that you are taking your ball and going home just makes you sound like a whiny bitch.
---
I just learned that Outer Worlds is included in the Microsoft Game Pass for PC so I'm installing it right now for $1!
---
Ha ha
---
If anything, the only thing it does is destroy the good path Bethesda were taking after Wild Appalachia. People started playing *there* because it was good content for free, as they promised.
---
Ya that the one. Sometimes there is a legendary Deathclaw waiting for you in it.
---
The subscription service is kinda what everyone wanted minus paying for it ..
---
You have your own world and you can have a couple of friends not some random ass griever but your friends to play with ...  
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why we have to pay for the online service then we have to pay for the subscription though?? 
---
I don‚Äôt see the meaning behind this
---
The good thing is at least 80% of the player base don‚Äôt come to this toxic forum full of narcissistic pre-pubescent entitled brats.
---
You pay 20 bucks for a game on sale and think Beth needs to bow down to your every request and expectation.
---
I bought the one year sub and having a blast.
---
It looks like at least 65% of each public world I played in did too.  They all had the 1st avatar exclusive.
---
Keep pitching fits and hating life....I‚Äôll continue to have fun in FO76.
---
I literally just bought the game yesterday despite the uproar and have been having a blast.  Seems like maybe I came in at the worst time haha.
---
Well played but risky. What about if thay player who will swap fo76 for outer worlds like the new game too much and totally forgot about fo76. I bet they are not gona came back if the outer worlds is nice. That means only the hardcore player will play the game. That could be the death of fo76, cu hardcore players are not too much of a number
---
I think most of the backlash is:
---
* Some people expected the servers to be something they can have offline, when Bethesda had said since the beginning they would be hosting the servers
---
* Bigger issue, the scrapbox and the tent - community suggestions - are behind the subscription paywall. I think this is the crux of all the major backlash.
---
 Can't say I disagree on the 2nd one, but with the attacks people have made towards people who have picked up first is kinda changing my mind, but that's the effect of making attacks like that.  It doesn't change people's minds - it just makes them angry and more opposed to you.
---
&gt;&gt; What kind of mental illness do you have to have to go around telling people not to do what they want to do?
---
Take your own advice.
---
That was literally this sub until Bethesda decided to repeatedly lie and become greedier and greedier with MTX. You know that right?
---
So I'm not the only one who thought that every single shotgun feels like a pipe pistol that's half broken.
---
No, it's not ONLY those who buy something are the sole ones affected by it. Those who BUY or do NOT buy a product BOTH directly affect not only that product itself, but possible future ones as well. So when Bethesda releases pure CR\*P that is the laziest sh\*t of pure nothingness content and/or a buggy broken mess, and you pay for it, you're ENABLING them to KEEP making CR\*P lazy content. You know, if people stop buying Rice Milk, Rice Milk will stop being sold. That's how business works, man. I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just irritated so I apologize for any rudeness but aren't you also tired of it? 
---
Wouldn't you enjoy all the stuff in that subscription if it was free also? And they DEFINITELY can afford to give it all for free.  
---
The point is, if you STOP buying their CR\*P content, they'll HAVE to make GOOD content that is WORTH buying. Are you understanding now how it affects everyone or are you still going to double down on your position? No problem with either, just make sure to use actual logic, reasons, and counter my points if you're not going to agree. I'm fine with actually discussing it. No anger, just talk.
---
I like the game, despite the criticisms it's had and if it was two or three bucks a month then I'd consider signing up to Fallout First, but ¬£11.99 in the UK? That's almost what I pay each month for Netflix and Amazon Prime per month put together! And you expect me to pay this for one game? Nah.
---
Of course. But if they remove the stash box they‚Äôll the people who bought the subscription either a partial refund or something else exclusive to them.
---
Tell me lies, tell me sweet little lies.
---
Apparently, The Outer Worlds is being a huge success, according to critics and players both.
---
Scum is harsh, I'd say they are sheep or at least foolsih, sorry y'all
---
I've legit said similar things IRL when my girlfriend leaves the door to the back porch open in the middle of February.  Oil aint cheap.  Not a dad, just old I guess.
---
In game it bugs me when people go through my small camp and leave all the doors open.  I've taken to locking the main part w/ a lvl 0 lock so if they want to run around leaving doors open at least I can take some pot shots at them like the angry old man that I am.
---
Yes, yes they could
---
What answers do you expect here?
---
Because you're an idiot.
---
Bethesda sucks now and doesn‚Äôt care about us. Plain and simple. Stop buying or caring about there shit until they actually fix stuff
---
I usually judge my games on ‚Äòdo I have fun and is it costing me less than a buck an hour‚Äô.  I‚Äôve been playing FO76 since the Beta and have been fortunate to have very few bugs, none of them game breaking. I‚Äôve also played enough hours that I‚Äôm essentially playing for free.  I like the game and often wish the endless complaining would stop, even for just a little while.  There is a small, but extremely vocal group of gamers that have been angry since beta that 76 wasn‚Äôt Fallout 5. Even a year later people are still annoyed about it.  I‚Äôve started just skimming the first few comments in FO76 posts so I can skip the complaining if it occurs.
---
Personally I don‚Äôt think they have enough content for FO76 to offer a subscription service yet. ESO has the craft bag as part of their subscription but unless you are an in-game crafter you don‚Äôt really need it. They also have massive amounts of content so it seems more like a high tier add-on than added content.  
---
I may get the subscription for the private server and rent out Scorch Queen runs to other players. They could pay me in rare Teddy Bears and teapots while I play music at my tent, set up far, far away. üòé
---
Or he‚Äôs a liar üòÇüòÇüòÇüññüèæüññüèæüññüèæ
---
seriously do you not know what you typed read your second paragraph and then read your first paragraph. why should i point out anything didnt you write it shouldnt you know where you contradict yourself?
---
A second private server, I'd spend all day just server hopping in my very own private server empire.
---
Firefly of happy thoughts
---
This sub has been nothing but guys crying about issues in game and then crying about the next update to fix those issues.
---
Appeal to worse problems?
---
Nice logical fallacy.
---
Hey, why have a mind if you can't change it. Welcome to Bethesda's wake....
---
I dont get the outrage. Have none of you ever played any other online game?  Do you see loot boxes? Do you see exclusive weapon, gear, or abilities? Do you see pvp leaderboards that ftp players best hope is maybe a top ten? 
---
If anything Fallout 76 is a shining example of how to handle mtx, and I hope sets an example to the rest.
---
An unpopular opinion, I know.  But judging by the number of players online with 1st, I dont think I'm alone.
---
When I saw the news.. I'm not even mad. Just disappointed...
---
I preordered the tricentennial edition day 1 and kept supporting them through buying some atoms. It wasn't much, but I just wanted to because I love this game and the community so much.
---
It just doesn't feels right being treated like second class citizen.
---
That can also happen where they bug out and never upgrade, it happened before the latest patch. Maybe the patch made it more likely to bug out?
---
Also to reply to one of your points, others are noticing the opposite of what you said. They have the private servers and STILL go to locations on the map and find them completely looted. It's because anyone in your friends list is allowed to join your game regardless of you inviting them. As well it's been reported even if you and all Fallout 1st Members leave, people who don't have Fallout 1st can stay in your "private" world. So I'm glad you're enjoying the subscription, but many others who wanted to enjoy it are finding out it was also not marketed correctly.
---
Lol you‚Äôre high
---
Thats only shows that he has standards and a working brain
---
You want the lies? The shop will only be cosmetics, preorder now for a canvas bag, there will be NO paywalls IE: subscription, or pass, we will provide free assistance with game issues....shall I continue?
---
Don't insult Andromeda, it has less bugs, fun gameplay, missions, different looking planets, its much better than F76 in every way. Sure, its a fail compared to previous Mass Effect games, the same as F76 is a fail compared to previous Fallout games, but that's where the similarities end.
---
And who are you? Lol. Just block me, dude. You‚Äôre wasting your breath.
---
Bethesda isn't going to be scared of anything as long as the small % of whales keeps pouring money into this game. The lack of playerbase doesn't even matter anymore if they're paying for the access of private servers.
---
Good, then it will be easier to reverse engineer the server software and play it as a single player game, just like every other dead "live service". Just look at Star Wars Galaxies and all the private shards people play now.
---
PC?
---
Ignore the idiots and fanboys with Stockholm Syndrome. Why concern yourself with what they think or say?
---
That's, the whole point of the sub.
---
Agree 100%. Excellent hypothesis backed up with a known example and facts.
---
I would love nothing more than to see the scrap box go to the entire player base. Even if they make an announcement blanketing it under the guise of fallout 1st being meant for subscribers to get stuff like this 1st and eventually it all makes its way into the game for everybody...whatever just make it happen.
---
I do this.  Its just out of common courtesy.
---
&gt; If you really need a working definition of an economy under socialistic rule, look no further to the inevitable result in the USSR
---
Why just the USSR? When there have been other examples of socialist rule through history?
---
&gt;And every European nation uses capitalism as a baseline for prosperity as far I know
---
Then why do they have a lot of economic and other regulations that are labelled as socialist and communist over and over again?
---
&gt;a stunning work of critique and art produced under the communistic/socialistic rule.
---
Good to know. A system where art can criticise the ruling political ideology. Reminds me a bit of that video game "Six Days in Fallujah" which was censored by the ruling political ideology in the US.
---
&gt;This goes back to the self-interest factor, people want to express themselves and will always try to do so, it just happens it is better under a nation that recognizes that self-interest and rewards it.
---
Yep, communist/socialist rule rewarded it by not having to worry about being homeless, not having enough food, being exploited by giant faceless corporations that would steal your art.
---
&gt;That is still self-interest, it is driven from the person itself.. Not an expectation from the state that mandated it was "for common good the society'.
---
I think you are working under the assumption that under communist or socialist the only thing that can happen is what the state mandates. That is not true. Artists can create the art they want. And they did, such as some of the first videogames.
---
The atoms are what sealed the deal for me. The servers work exactly as I predicted they would and were offered at the lowest point of my predicted price range. Atoms were the icing on the cake.
---
It's supposed to not include complaints, thats the whole point.
---
After multiple places reported it, and people uploaded videos they admitted it. Lol that's not much of an admission. 
---
I do like this line "We are also exploring ways to restore the missing items" Hopefully they are able to do it, although I think they will somehow screw that up as well and give everyone a massive amount of junk.
---
Yeah, to bad its locked behind the Fallout #### You First Subscription
---
Seems I got stupid lucky. Too bad im specced into explosives. To the marketplace I go!
---
Thanks everyone
---
Seems like this is implying more of a Discussion post....  but what if?
---
That would be bad.  I think that‚Äôs the most correct answer you can get.
---
&gt; And you‚Äôll call me stupid for enjoying the game. That‚Äôs fine. Whatever. 
---
You're not stupid for enjoying the game, in all honesty 98% of the people "hating" on the game also love the game and they just don't want to see it go down this path and they want change and we're tired of being taken advantage of, y'know?  
---
&gt; I‚Äôm just a bit disappointed that people can‚Äôt seem to just move on and find something that they do enjoy, and instead sit here and trash the game. 
---
I'm "trashing" the game because I want them to actually do better, I want to continue playing this game everyday and enjoying my time as I wait for more content, not be sold community ideas and things that should have been in the game at launch. People will argue that servers "need" money for us to play and no game gives free servers, correct, but these servers also continue to run even when we're offline and doing whatever. Private worlds on the other hand, these servers shut down after awhile. They removed survival so they could sell us servers, that's not cool. And they're selling us more non-cosmetic items even though they promised not to, I personally think infinite junk is p2w, others may not think so. But this is only enabling them to put more and ore utility items into the game until it gets to the point we have to buy perkcard loadouts or something, it's just not cool.
---
Nobody actually "agrees* to anything like that, we buy products that are sold to us. We used to own those products, I completely reject that we've somehow switched to fancy corporate-dictated rentals disguised as purchases just because every single purchase includes a digital book equivalent to, "if you shop in this store, your purchase is a contract for any condition we choose".
---
I thought only your invited friends could join your world
---
Outer worlds is a single player game. It has a limited shelf life for a long-term player base. And you might say that, but FO1st members are all over the game right now.
---
And by reacting so strongly, you tell players that there's something worth caring for here. When that shiny new DLC comes, they aren't going to care about some months old internet rage.
---
Well, first it isn't a fallout game, so that's important to note, although there is clearly inspiration there, of course.
---
And it definitely doesn't feel like a watered down anything IMO, it's great fun! I wouldn't say it's more or less complex than something like NV, but it's a little different, and I think in some very good ways. :)
---
Drop 1 raw fertilizer
---
Parts of Wastelanders will surely be behind a paywall. I'm expecting companions to be a paid-only feature.
---
Pretty good for the half hour I played before I had to go to bed cuz I have work today
---
You guys will not be disappointed.
---
Played last night by using the New Zealand trick and got 2 hours in.  So refreshing to have traditional RPG mechanics like NPC conversations with speech checks!
---
perhaps they could let everyone have a 1 month or 2 of Fallout 1st, as a gesture of goodwill.  scrap stash boxes and second camp feels like pay to win...
---
It affect whole industry ffs kid wake the fk up
---
Boy you just walked in the wrong place at the wrong time. Time for you karma to be smashed into the ground! But actually forum more positive just seems like a lot of people came here to whore out for karma. Haven't seen a drop in player count on xbox, you can see number of posts currently active on club and was currently same usually weekday amount.
---
That's not true at all. You "win" when you change your mind, change someone's mind, or show how the opposing side has no logical arguments. I've shown you have no logical arguments, so thank you, friend. I'm angry, but at Bethesda, not you, and that's because I have self-respect and don't think they should make money off of whatever lazy bullsh*t they try selling us just because they're "Bethesda." I've said it many times. There's no problem in enjoying the game. I'm just looking for the logical reasonable arguments for why you think it's wrong to call it a bad game or judge Bethesda for their obviously greedy decisions.
---
"Wastelanders costs $19.99 but if you have a Fallout 1st Subscription, it's free! (Only while subscription lasts)"
---
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO BET!?
---
That's standard practice across pretty much any subscription service tbh. And most things.  If you buy 100 beers you'll get it cheaper than buying them singly.
---
They say everywhere it's for private and adventure mode. Both. You could read their infos about it or just make a speculative post.
---
That is for the lawyers to sort. It's not only about the game being so terribly full of bugs. It is a lot more than that. Contact your State Attorney General.
---
The trailer says ‚ÄúFree for Fallout 76 players‚Äù
---
I played a little bit last night, hope you enjoy it.
---
It won‚Äôt be. So this is a pointless question. How many times do they need to say it‚Äôs their largest free expansion yet?
---
We've all heard of false advertising before, it's just a ridiculous argument in this case. The argument that "Bethesda lied", is based on a loose interpretation of a single quote.
---
The game has been out for a year, most veteran players have hundreds of hours, and there is so much media out there regarding this game, that being unaware of any part of the game at this point is your own fault.
---
Except it is back firing, all the press is just showing off the outer worlds while laughing about fo76:
---
https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2019/10/23/fallout-just-gave-people-reason-play-outer-worlds-instead/
---
Yea I‚Äôve played them all starting with 1.  
---
I‚Äôm not saying the NV version has better detail. Obviously the newer game has better detail. I was just saying that the skins coming for it have better detail than the base version released with F1st
---
The version we have now is close to the NCR but it‚Äôs not the same. Even says CPD on the chest and not LVPD. The helmet is shaped slightly different as well. 
---
It‚Äôs all just riot gear though.
---
totally agree and attest to this subbreddits powrr. this sub has kept me playing Fo76 &amp; d
---
not demanding refund.
---
Is it hard typing while sucking bethesda's dick at the same time?
---
You‚Äôre probably one of the rare few my post wasn‚Äôt actually aimed at. I respect you and your thoughts on this in full.
---
https://youtu.be/h6_JZec_MIU
---
Suck less Bethesda dick
---
Look up Providence Equity Partners and Bethesda/Zenimax.
---
Forgive the brevity, as I‚Äôm on mobile, but the tl;dr is that Providence is invested heavily in Bethesda, and it‚Äôs believed their influence is driving the increased monetization efforts of the company, so that they can drive up share prices for an inevitable public offering.
---
Added an edit to the original suggesting people contact their State Attorney General.
---
my first ever legendary SB last night as I did Census south of watoga.  was a 2\* and dropped a 2\* bloodied lead-pipe.
---
You made the claim so the burden of proof is on you. Or if I claim you to be a pink peacock that dances in the rain on Tuesdays, is it your responsibility to prove me wrong?
---
You know, just like how I made a claim originally and provided EVIDENCE and LOGIC. I'll even restate it for you if you didn't read it the first time. 
---
"I've done far more research than a biased presentation made by Bethesda. I know at launch there were no NPC's, there was no story (audio tapes don't count as a story, it's lore), bad graphics quality, PVP that didn't work well, and low storage space on a game where storing is one of the most important features. "
---
So I'm just looking for YOUR logic and reasoning. I'm willing to change my mind, but why can't you argue a single point? Is it because my points were true? Probably so.
---
So, no, you can‚Äôt? You‚Äôre just trying to put words in my mouth. Gotcha.
---
Nope people still play and pay for 1st.
---
You seem very rude, friend
---
Bad ass!! How much time this take to build? I‚Äôd love to try n build my own version!
---
Or he doesn't want to deal with total idiots like yourself.
---
I guess...
---
Lol he got exposed but think what you want üòÇüòÇüòÇüññüèæüññüèæüññüèæ
---
Bethesda also stated that the Atom shop would be cosmetic only but now look at us
---
OK again this arguement like you guys are stuck on the junk part and thats not the issue.  Just think for 2 sec and concentrate and forget about junk. Following your logic  
---
NO JUNK IN STASH MEANS MORE ROOM FOR  armor, weapons, food, ammo, unscrapped junk  which does strain the engine. so it is a lie when 60% or more is junk and now is replaces with stuff than does slow down engine.
---
I cant believe no one understands this
---
P2w would be if you didn‚Äôt need to farm items and just buy them. This is not pay 2 win..
---
Definitely. I read the post about First and I'm pretty sure I could feel my heart collapsing in on itself.
---
No, I don‚Äôt. I remember when this sub was made because /r/fallout was nothing but memes about how bad 76 is. The same people have been here since day 1, doing the same stuff.
---
I added an edit to the original suggesting people contact their State Attorney General. Fallout 76 from the B.E.T.A. to now has been a total package of lies. If no one does anything nothing will ever change.
---
Sure vent your anger, it doesn't bother me. I stopped buying into hype long before this and realized the gaming industry as a whole has been a shit show for awhile now. Doesn't stop me from enjoying some of them for what they offered.
---
And if you are in that private world you are not only dependent on the game server stability, but at the whims of your host, if they have a PC crash, internet d/c, anything.. you are disconnected.
---
They say everywhere it's for private and adventure mode. Both.
---
So you can buy the monthly addendum. Or not.
---
Mobile games can be very addictive.
---
Disgusting.
---
Honestly id be fine with subscription owners getting it first (maybe a week or 2) then us "leeches" get it for free after the exclusivity period
---
Lol if what you want to do is collect pixelated trash in a game maybe go outside and collect literal trash and do something productive? All I know is if that‚Äôs what I wanted to do, I would probably reevaluate myself. Just sayin cuz
---
Not a pointless question, tis a concern of mine so I thought I'd ask on here to see if others shared my thoughts or not.
---
what's the name of the subreddit with the nice people who are having fun?
---
I would have bought it, if it were only atoms.
---
The thing is I honestly dig the whole fallout 1st subscription. As an OG fallout fan and long time player of the franchise it gives us the ability to have not just whatever but however much of what we want. Just like in previous games. And as somebody who never cared about/participated in PvP this helps 76 feel more like its predecessors. All I ever wanted was a fallout game that I could play with my friends that also enjoy the franchise and this does exactly that. Now all the PvPers and story driven can play with their own kind. One of the reasons I also don‚Äôt consider it ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù at least in my specific circumstance.
---
I'm currently running a 50 slot rust server that costs ¬£7.50 a month.. for one. If I asked my provider for thousands of them I'm sure it would be much cheaper.
---
I dont even remotely care
---
Everyone in your friends list can join without invitation.
---
how about no
---
You made a new Reddit account to tell people to uninstall Fo76?
---
Bethesda is going to be making less &amp; less, I for one won't be buying their games unless they clean up their act and actually invest in their engine that is decades behind the competition.
---
If you enjoyed the game last week, then you should still enjoy the game today.
---
No features or functionality was removed from your gameplay experience by Fallout 1st.
---
Uhhh, can't tell if youre serious or? 
---
Im new here, so i can't tell if someone is being ironic or not
---
My karma can take it. But then, I don‚Äôt actually care what my karma looks like. 
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôve been condensing servers to keep them populated. Whenever you‚Äôre in game and you randomly disconnect, it‚Äôs likely because the server you were on was low population and they wanted you to move to a more populated one.
---
Yup. The problem with reddit is that once something snowballs it turns into a circlejerk for karma. Anyone that goes against the herd is downvoted to oblivion and most dissenters avoid posting their opinion because they just end up losing karma.
---
Thanks, I'm a troll now because an Internet stranger said so.
---
Again, the payoff is for the Wastelanders DLC. The people reading those articles either hate fo76 already or have already paid. 
---
When that DLC comes, those articles will be old news. The internet has the attention span of a goldfish after all.
---
Would you please stop throwing money at companies like Bethesda? Thanks.
---
Tell people all your future content will be free and mtx will be cosmetic only, then adding paywalls and convenience mtx not even a year into a game's lifespan.. yeah.. shining example!   
---
and yes you see exclusive gear, exclusive game features, quality of life improvements added behind a paywall.. no one said loot box. the outrage is from being lied to.. like it's waaaay beyond subjective.. the ACTUAL statements pete hines answers are completely contradicted at this point.. I don't even know how you can defend this game at this point.
---
I never knew this, does it work on the SBQ?
---
That wasn't my point. It's just that the world has got so wacky I can't tell whenever anyone's being serious or not these days
---
They hated him because he told the truth
---
Except for modding, something this game doesn't offer, which is why fallout 4 still has a larger player base than this game does on steam years after it came out.
---
It's not cursed. It's a classic tale of good intentions gone awry by corporate meddling. I like Fallout 76, I've easily spent a couple hundred on it. But I can't play it anymore with this subscription stuff.
---
Nah, I had two back to back legendaries during scorched Earth last night. Loving this
---
Good riddance Fo76, hello Outer Worlds!
---
That last line is so on point.
---
As much as BGS looks like a raider gang right now, the community at large is also showing off a pretty bad look. For a community existing in a virtual post apocalyptic future, we don‚Äôt seem to handle adversity very well. 
---
I‚Äôm not particularly thrilled at the way premium membership was implemented and priced, but the community‚Äôs pedestal is looking pretty shaky. 100% venom and not a high road in sight. Offering to engage in intelligent conversation was never even considered. The pitchforks were sharpened and ready.
---
Have we really been supportive? We complain about literally everything at every turn. One week we need more raider themed cosmetics.  Now there‚Äôs too many. Quest X is too hard. Weapon Y is too rare. A,B and C rewards are not good enough. Ad nauseam.
---
With all the demands, threats and reactionary vitriol, the community is behaving just as bad as Bethesda‚Äôs greedy corporate villain archetype. Put into adventure context, any hero passing by would wonder which side needed to be saved from the other. If it were me, I‚Äôd decide we deserve each other and move on.
---
Welcome to reddit. 
---
Troll mode aside, it depends on which post I‚Äôm looking at. Reddit‚Äôs a pretty safe place to go unfiltered.
---
Same here.
---
I would‚Äôve bought it just for the atoms and emotes, it‚Äôs the fact that it creates a paywal is why I won‚Äôt pay for it.
---
I'm not saying I won't, it just sucks to now have to pay to access stuff we've been asking for since launch. Plus I'm more concerned about what this means for the future.
---
if this is the stuff they are producing then they need to be put out of their misery.
---
I am serious. It‚Äôs not pay 2 win. You still need to grind like everyone else. I do think the unlimited storage is problematic, but wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs p2w by any means. It‚Äôs definitely an uneven playing field. Still not p2w
---
Lifeboats are in the subscription service
---
Pathetic... it‚Äôs a game, get over it. You‚Äôre a victim of nothing other than getting your feelings hurt because others think differently than you.
---
You shouldn‚Äôt be worried. If they charge for wastelanders I will give you all my gear that I‚Äôve collected over the past 600 hours. It‚Äôs not happening.
---
Yes. Enforcer perk is another great way to get them to land. Every pellet from a shotgun has a chance to cripple.
---
Agree with others...itll be both...free expansion, with exclusive content for 1st users. 
---
   They have to keep people paying for fallout 1st somehow, and wastelanders is the next big thing. So some of it will be pay to play for sure. Especially with how many people are buying fallout 1st.
---
  Thats probably the real reason it got pushed back...so they could implement fallout 1st crap
---
Wastelanders at the earliest is Q1 2020, this game will be lucky to make it to the end of this year at the rate they are going. The player base is now smaller than fallout 4's and every single news article about it just blasts fallout 76 while gushing over the outer worlds and points out that you can get it for less than the cost of a single month of fallout 1st.
---
For viral marketing to work you have to make sure it is about you, NOT your main competitor and how much better they are than you are at a fraction of the price.
---
That survey doesn't really address the main problem: Bethesda introducing pay2win elements when they promised they wouldn't.
---
Bruh fuck this dumb game. If you still play it you‚Äôre even more sick than Bethesda. The game was a money grab you knew this. Just get rid of the game and buy a better fallout.
---
Different playstyles means different experiences. Im glad this update didnt ruin your fun, but it sure ruined mine.
---
Adi√≥s!
---
Good to know thanks
---
I'm confused, is Jim Gaffigan's TID "manofredearth"?
---
Am I supposed to inflate the worth of their opinion because they are/aren't a "celebrity"?
---
r/fo76filthycasuals
---
And parts in the atomic shop, I wouldn't put it past them dividing it 3 ways at this point.
---
You questioned my terminology and I require your explanation. Burden of proof is on you as well. Don't act like you are entitled to anything and think you can get away without explaining your action
---
it should be free for all, not pay for this server and get this for free. Gives other an advantage, like scrap boxes.
---
Yes you did see a paint job for scout Lol
---
Yes please. I've had it happen to opponents and happen to me. The other night I had a whole group of 4 show up to fight my group of 2 and they started giving the thumbs down. It took 5 minutes before one of them finally told me over voice that I was bugged. I just flat out didn't notice I wasn't taking any damage :(
---
Ruined something that could have continued longer into the night. I offered to restart my game and continue but the other group was rightfully salty.
---
I only know kid, and I know you're an idiot.
---
Is your have exclusive rights to an I. P then it is by definition a monopoly, I don't know how you cant understand this, it's the exact same issue that people are using with streaming and exclusive rights, we just end up with multiple shop fronts that don't compete with each other in any way because every one has their own walled garden of services the other can't legally provide. Literally the only reason people are buying exclusive rights and not just shared rights is so they can literally monopolise that I.p. Its anti consumer at the best, and I.p mismanagement at the worst
---
Christ you people will defend anything
---
These ultimatum posts are cringey as fuck.
---
How do u get ur own animal
---
No, but Reddit always thinks that it's WAY more important than it actually is. That's my point.
---
Because I'm a masochist. Everytime I crash or freeze or encounter a bug I just say thank you Todd may I have another. üòú
---
Did the paywall hurt you? Move on, and stop whining...
---
Whenever me, my teammates, or my opponents get glitched i have em relog or i pull from battle
---
You could already have a stash entirely full of armor and weapons with no junk in it prior to the whole scrapbox concept. It's entirely possible that they felt confident in servers supporting that much and an additional 33 items with simple integer counts not being an excessive additional strain
---
I'm not sucking anyone's dick. I'm not sure how long I'm going to keep playing because I've become bored with the game. If i do stop playing I won't be making a post crying like a three year old that can't have cereal for dinner.
---
Agreed!!! I want feeling too "adventurous last night so I sat and babysat my plants and water purifiers. In an hour I got enough to sell out half a venders cap limit. It was a full time job! Nice change of pace though
---
I've had nearly unlimited ammo and repairs for a very long time. I'd fill my stash with steel, go do lucky hole, and do the slow walk to fort defiance. Craft a weeks worth of ammo, and on I went.  Only difference now is that minute long slow walk. 
---
As for gear repairs, with white night lvl3 at the station, repairs cost almost nothing. I also have too many repair kits, just from the queen.  They were becoming a weight problem.
---
Go play any other online game, then come back and tell bethesda just how wrong you were.
---
I have never known anyone before this game to have voiced that they wanted multiplayer. The idea is anathema to Fallout to me. 
---
I honestly don't care if it sounds harsh. Anyone whining about how Bethesda "lied" to them shouldn't have been so naive to have been swindled like this. They have nobody to blame but themselves, especially if they kept playing and defending and spending in the game after launch.
---
don't like it don't buy it that simple
---
Let the salt flow through you üòÇüòÇüòÇüññüèæüññüèæüññüèæ
---
I don't agree with the people who give Bethesda money for this shit, but I'm not angry with them. I rather blame the robber than the guy who did let himself be robbed. 
---
Though if whales cut hold themselves back for a bit, that would be nice. Games have become this because we allowed it with our money.
---
They aren‚Äôt listening.
---
Soon they‚Äôll have planned development pulling the plug in common too
---
\*yawn\*
---
Wait you didn't give me your shit first.
---
Angry Joe speaks super highly on outer worlds. I'm thinking of getting it now.
---
InigoMontoya.gif
---
If you want another true Fallout game on a modern engine, give the Outer Worlds a try.
---
i think you should leave
---

This sub has been nothing but complaint about everything they change how can you say beacon of positivity with a straight face
---
You know what, even though you're being an idiot online, I hope you have a good day boss.
---
I've wondered the same thing since the day I bought it.  Guitar Hero live was a wake-up, so to speak, for that question.
---
Given the amount of storage it already uses on our systems, It would be really nice if somewhere in their coding archives, they have a couple of routines that will allow for offline/local play.
---
Can you leave the sub and forum about Fallout 76 as well and stop bitching?
---
Yeah, no one cares. You and every other self righteous shithead are bitching about the game. Too bad people still enjoy it and your opinions mean nothing.

Oh okay, so do you have to block friends that you do not want to play with in the private world??

You first.

After Fallout 3 launched I was on the Fallout forums at Bethesda quite a bit. There was plenty of daily posts asking for an MMO fallout or at the very least a co-op. 
---
As far as harsh I only mean in regard to no one asking for it.
---
Not whining, just asking a question which in part was prompted by my daughter.  Whining would be if I was screaming curses and throwing my toys out the pram like I've seen in so many posts across various SM platforms. me I'm happily running around serving The Cult of the Mothman.
---
Yea what the hell Bethesda? You mess up over and over and over again. This subscription is BS and a bitch slap to your most loyal players.
---
No, YOU made a first claim, that puts the burden of proof on you. Just like with the Fallout argument I made the first claim, which is why I included proof. And I have actually changed my mind based on "angry reddit posts" so again, you're just wrong but then that's why you didn't include any evidence, reason, or logic of course. If you really think the ONLY reason you can't argue me is because I haven't played the game I can download it right now. I don't have to buy it, I share games with someone who has it. I can play it whenever I want, I've just never wanted to. If you want me to play it and then discuss it with you, I'll be fine with that, but you just don't seem to want to discuss a thing you just want to suck off Bethesda.
---
Talk about conspiracies.
---
Adios amigo
---
Bethesda isn't worried about anything. The fact that this game isn't already completely dead gives off a resounding answer to Bethesda that this kind of behavior is okay. I keep saying, and I'll continue - Many of you will cave and purchase this shit subscription. Many of you will cave and continue to purchase items from atom shop. All of you will cave and preorder Edler Scrolls 6 "super-mega roadmap" edition, without even waiting for reviews. Companies will continue to get away with this because video game consumers have no standards, and we'll let trash go down our throats so long as it has even the tiniest bit of sugar sprinkles on it.
---
You‚Äôd think people would learn not to trust this company, but that day will never come.  Soon as the new, shiny game comes out, everyone forgets.
---
xD deuces bitch. I am glad you enjoy the game, I like it too.
---
Idk why my reply didnt send, reddit is weird. But yeah, im glad youre having fun. Playstyles differ, so does the experience. Glad it didnt ruin your fun, but it ruined mine.
---
Spread and effective range got hit hard; now you have to basically be in melee range. Time was my pump shotgun could take down shit 50 feet away. No longer.
---
And, a melee build would do more damage anyway.

Predatory business tactics, to prey on the mentally vulnerable!
---
 So you spent a little real money, and you've tied some real worth to this pile of absolutely nothing. Now you want to make sure you don't miss out on all the shiny new nothings you get! Better get the subscription so you don't lose out on the value of the first bit of money you spent. Now you've got upkeep on an implanted, fake, sense of value. Awesome.

A NEW HAND TOUCHES THE BEACON
---
It‚Äôs wacky how they expect you to pay for the stuff they put out instead of getting it for free. Like what are they, a functioning company? Crazy af.
---
Delete the characters and uninstall.
---
kinda, i am just really upset about Fo76, preordered it and i allready have around 300 hours on it, and i just dislike bethesda fo f ing up another game. Best thing would be to allow us to host our own servers. i just had an idea. and wanted to ventilate it
---
There is no Time saving here, if they implemented a feature that allowed you to not have to grind or somehow speed that process up I would agree. But that‚Äôs not the case here. You still have to kill bad guys And loot containers and craft whatever you need
---
It's the right thing to do but honestly I've had it happen to me twice and I have legitimately not noticed until it was pointed out to me. I really can't even make up an excuse for how I don't notice other than being caught up in the moment. Sounds pretty stupid when I start to want to type out that I don't notice the fact that I'm not getting killed.
---
Can't tell if you're fifty or ten, but you're growing on me kid.
---
Yet here you are, posting about a dead game a full year after its release. Keep doing their dirty work for them. LOL
---
It's very old school and in some ways that's not always a good thing.
---
You have a shit ton of reading.  I'm all for reading, when I pick up a book.  When I play a game, I don't want to read for hours on end.
---
Also, you can kill NPCs you need in quests.  You can fuck up your own game by doing things out of sequence which the game does encourage (exploration, etc.)
---
Despite those issues and many others, Morrowind is one of my all time favorite open world RPGs.  Skyrim is basically Morrowind but streamlined for the masses.

Have fun spending your money on a corrupt corporation that will keep lying and charging you as much as they can.
---
I'm going to spend my time on something that actually worths my time.
---
I tried it... three times. I found it incredibly dumb. Magically, eternal spawning enemies?? Do i get magically, eternally respawning ammo &amp; stimpaks?  It felt lazy, brainless and pointless - micro rewards for endless minutes of nonstop, super annoying enemies in a visually irritating space. It was perhaps the most useless Fallout add-on I've ever seen since fallout 1. And for what? Some elusive magical armor to make me even MORE impervious to damage than 0X-1 P.A. already is? I rarely use PA at this point anyways. And... there's pretty much zero penalty for dying anyways, so who cares? Fallout 4 DLC's were breathtakingly awesome &amp; immersive... these feel hollow, stupid and aimed gratifying players who run around at 10% health and wacked out, ridiculous perk card setups to where their guns do 7,000 damage with one shot. It's all just kind of ridiculous.
---
They did say a PTS is coming as well...
---
I logged on yesterday for about two hours.  FO76 is my "turn off my brain and chill" game.
---
Every, and I mean every, vendor camp I visited had a scrapbox.  I did two nuke events - NCR armor everywhere.
---
I have the sneaking suspicion BS is making bank on this subscription.
---
They have already been going down this path. People that still play this game just have a higher tolerance for Bethesda‚Äôs bullshit. I‚Äôm surprised it took this colossal screw up to finally get them to see Bethesda for they really are. I mean it‚Äôs been nothing but scandal after scandal.
---
Another solo player here. Like you I love exploring Appalachia, taking pictures and generally hoarding junk around for various crafts. sales and mod learning.  
---
When I am tired with once character around level 100+, I usually make another build and continue to do the same.  
---
So far I purchased every single deal they offered for a costume + atoms, which was 10 EUR for me.  
---
Naturally Fallout 1st should've been a no brainer purchase for me, however it itsn't so.  
---
Because it feels wrong and forced for a mere 5 more EUR a month I already spent since july.  
---
And it's time to state why it's forced and wrong.  
---
Many players (active or not) say it is optional and does not give any advantage over the non-paying player.  
---
And it is wrong.  
---
On a fresh server a paying player has no competition over:  
---
 Junk  
---
 Workshops  
---
 World drops (plans, magazines, outfits and bobble heads)  
---
 Farmable flora and fauna (specifically nukes)  
---
 Specific events (farmable horde events and one violent night etc.)  
---
Forced:  
---
 More stable servers (due to low players, duh)  
---
 Less latency on specific places (due to low players once again)  
---
 Scrapbox (remember junk had weight due to server stability, yup)  
---
I know private servers cost money, but as we learned this service is neither private nor server.  
---
Also it has bugs on launch and requires hotfix.  
---
Don't get me wrong, I still love the game. I have no problem to pay for a month or a year subscription, but I don't want to add fuel to the flame.  
---
Flame which hinders the already broken economy and diversifies the dwindling player base.  
---
I didn't want Fallout 76 to follow the other MMORPGs that I played.  
---
Sadly it did.  
---
Now I have to step away of the game. I only hope it's for a week or a month, but it really depends on Bethesda's response or next patch.
---
The main issue is that Bethesda is trying to do MMORPG Tactics with a non MMORPG. They aren't delivering constant content, patches, fixes, etc. We're lucky to get a Power Armor fix in time, let alone new content - hell the only new guaranteed content that hasn't been cosmetics just got delayed. I mean honestly look at some of the perk cards that STILL don't work properly.
---
Bethesda was pretty much the first big company to push for micro-transactions, and they continue to try and push the button every chance they get, to see where people will finally stop giving them money. It's disgusting, but my fear is that other companies will try to adopt their policies.
---
Good for you....
---
Yawn...
---
I've grown accustomed to your emojis, what can I say. Add me on psn, dat DreamyBulbasaur
---
Exclusive skins only.
---
There is zero player vs player advantage, just as good old Pete promised. This is the shining example. This is the heart of the promise, and has been kept. 
---
There is a huge difference between all content will be free, and we will never offer more QOL for $
---
Look at the popular shooters. If you dont buy the maps, you cant even play. Bethesda is not charging anything for content. That was always the promise.
---
So raising the scrip limit and letting people cash in stashed items would help stability I suppose.
---
As do I.
---
Don't let the wave of drama fool you.  The ONLY shift here with the arrival of F1 is the tent and the scrapbox.  That's it.  That's all that goes against their original attempt at making all extra content free.  They told us FOUR MONTHS AGO that their original vision was not going to work, and they told us a week or two ago that they're going to have to put more "useful" stuff available for purchase if the game is to survive financially.  
---
All of this freakout that you're seeing is over a stashbox and a tent.  Seriously.
---
Keep playing if you love the game, and don't let others' negativity affect you.  This is bandwagon outrage shit and will die down once the mob disperses.  It's still the same game for you that it was last week.  If you don't want to spend a penny on it, you don't have to.
---
Lol you twelve year old or something? You said it first! you prove first!! BAAAAHH!! 
---
I still don't take you seriously btw
---
Just a metaphor. An analogy of how we are abiding by such market when we all played games when they were developed with the intention of creating something unique or entertaining as hell, not giving sweat and blood to make the most cash cow possible.
---
The "death of oldschool gamers" don't mean a physical death, but actually the death of our pride and respect for ourselves. Kinda lame to have to explain this, don't know if you guys didn't get it or just pretend you didn't just to oppose me.
---
Right away.
---
I fully expect the scrap box and second camp to be paid features if they make them available to everybody. But First members try them first....
---
We all are angry but it won‚Äôt really change anything if you really wanna show your dissatisfaction #VoteWithYourWallet
---
It's not visual that's for sure. The junk is just gone.
---
Sounds like those guys read one of my posts.
---
I think for the price, it is worth it. Ignoring all the other things surrounding the game, if you've been a fan of the fallout series you can get your money's worth in enjoyment just exploring the world and seeing the story.  
---
and it's probably better to explore the world now over later, when wastelanders comes out, I don't know how the world will change and you might miss out on some of the older lore that was in the game at start.
---
Im sorry Mister Elite, but there are casuals playing, too.
---
I'm honestly pretty upset. My gf and I just bought FO76 about 3 weeks ago to have something we could do together when we aren't with each other, and the game seemed like it was on the upswing.
---
Then Bethesda had to go and deep dick the fanbase. I always figured that Bethesda games have always been, at the very least, worth their price. The latest news is really disheartening, and making me second guess my loyalty to the company.
---
I'm amazed that you would be buying 1000 atoms every month for the next year anyways. I can get with why you would subscribe then, I guess but still don't think I shouldn't get unlimited scrap or a tent because I choose not to pay 10 a month when you do. I already paid 60, I couldn't imagine paying.160 for it! It is simply not that quality and I'm afraid 6 months from now you might regret it
---
Worth of time and money are subjective: while I don't really care to buy Fallout 1st, there are people who DO care, and they aren't, in fact, wasting money because they enjoy what they bought. So stop being a salty dickhead and acting like you speak for everyone. Fallout 76 is a decent game. Get over it and play FO4 like you said.
---
I‚Äôm going to go out in a limb and say you don‚Äôt play the game
---
The settlement sub just has their heads in the sand and just keep on playing this garbage game.
---
Mocking it for their stupid actions? Yeah how did that work out for "ride to hell: retribution"? Lots of people talked about it as well making memes about how bad it was, just like they are doing with this game. That game was an absolute flop. LOL
---
Last I knew, lots of people were still playing, discussing and producing videos on the last *Fallout* game those Obsidian guys did. Can‚Äôt see outer worlds losing appeal or interest anytime soon, even some of the Bethesdrone YouTube shills have started to cover it more than FO76.
---
&gt; I also am mad about the price. $100 a year (or more) is absolutely ridiculous.
---
I have a simple suggestion about the price.
---
If it's too high, then just don't pay it.
---
End of story.
---
Whats your gt
---
Having lived through several MMO EoL events all I can say is expect an announcement one day that the jig is up and effective X date the servers will cease to be online. When that day comes all your highly coveted digital items will be gone for good. 
---
It is tough to swallow. The last time it happened I vowed to never allow myself to get hooked on another game of that type. Here I am though.....
---
There is one in Hopewell Cave, right before the Deathclaw spawn.
---
And I find it hilarious you are judging how many people bought this crap, based on few of your friends and the 20 servers that keep running. You obviously don't understand how things work when it comes to calculating votes and opinions. Check Twitch, there are no streams of Fallout 76 that gather more than few people. If that doesn't mean anything to you (because you are blind to the obvious facts), then maybe check official statistics from game retailers. Fallout 76 is the biggest flop in the whole gaming industry. It is a SCAM!
---
Agreed. I haven't spent a penny on F076 yet, but was considering getting the $10 bundle of atoms now that I've farmed most of the player/world challenges, I still enjoy the daily/weekly but I've passed on a few things I'd rather not have. I was thinking it'd be nice to get a $10 bundle every once in a while, when it comes with a nice outfit+ 500 extra atoms because I play for so few hours a week with jobs/kids/wife/etc... F01st is perfect for what I was wanting, and I'd love to have that NCR Ranger outfit...but the stash and tent should be free, give me the atoms, outfit and emotes...maybe some other goodies for a monthly price. I can decide from month to month if I want it or not and everyone's happy
---
They had mods day 1 for the Witcher, etc. You would be very surprised.
---
Yeah get it offers more than 20$ worth of gameplay and replay-ability.
---
Damn, they are actually going to make people pay for mods. They are really digging deep for cash. Although, given how many people still play this game I would bet this is their most profitable Fallout yet and probably sets the stage for all future releases.
---
Last week I had asked people if the game was worth getting back into and a lot of people said it was way better. I had every intention to reinstall and play. I didn‚Äôt get a chance to do it last week, but now this happened. I‚Äôm no longer even slightly interested in this game. It‚Äôs made me more hyped to get on The Outer Worlds tonight. Screw Bethesda, give your business to Obsidian.
---
They promised no p2w and now they introduced p2w, we're mad that they broke their promise and made the product worse by the introduction of p2w elements after we already paid for it. If you don't see that, then you're ignorant.
---
is there any game breaking glitches?? and can i play it solo?? thanks
---
It's a little early to be speculating about FO76 shutting down. 
---
Besides, from what I can see the subscription service seems quite popular. Despite what the collective on here and youtube thinks it seems to be doing well. I'll never buy it but I'm cheap and won't pay that much. However there's a lot of people who have.
---
I indeed am
---
Wait decontamination arches get rid of mutations as well? Does that apply Even with perks?
---
Why would you be mad about the subscription?  if it's more money than you want to pay then just don't pay it.  Why would you get angry?
---
They *should* transfers me all their money. You all should. But this won't happen. That's capitalism.
---
What about repair kids and scrap kids? Scrap kits with the new addition is surely a bomb combination.
---
Its much less item management These days.

Lets say you and your buddy are in a competition on Who gets to level 100 first.

This would be funny, but Titanic 2 is already an actual film.

Exactly. Reddit and YT might be the loudest, but they're not all of the people playing the game.

You can build one as a CAMP item. You'll find it under Resources. I think you need some razorgrain and fertiliser to build one. You get a Brahmin and a wheelbarrow thingy. if you interact with the cow you can sometimes milk it; otherwise it will just try to kick you.

yeah, anyone's being critical is a 3 year old that can't have a kid cereal for dinner. Except the cereal cost 100$ dollars and the parent is now trying to make the kid pay for a spoon, milk and a bowl.

I could say the same about you taking the time to comment on this.. it takes all of 2 minutes to post or answer dude. it's not like i'm gonna whine about it for days, i'll just go play some outer worlds. what else am I gonna post on a FO76 reddit besides my opinion of FO76.. if you're looking for pro subscription posts your gonna be scrolling for a while dawg..
---
Fallout 76 is like a candle in the wind.
---
Unreliable.
---
Guess we'll find out in Feb/March when wastelanders drops.
---
Of course they'll play it. They will also come back to play new Bethedsa crap-content. Sheep are sheep and attention spans are short.
---
At this point yes, it‚Äôs whining. The ESO model is identical. If you took 3 seconds you‚Äôd discover this and that Bethesda runs that successful game. 
---
Bethesda is also a business... businesses make money by providing items or services and they‚Äôre doing just that. 
---
Microsoft and Xbox live is literally a paywall... without them you‚Äôll never play any online game you buy.
---
I'm glad you brought it up, can we talk about the flyer nerf one more time?
---
It‚Äôs not about how many you turn in it‚Äôs about completing the quest each time you complete the quest you are rewarded and the rewards differ but in two days I‚Äôve gotten the Sergeant and the captain paint the next day I got the officer and the paladin paint just by turning them in one at a time you‚Äôre just gonna have to make multiple trips back-and-forth to get them all out of one area ams build and White springs bunker are the best and there is some in the vault tech university I‚Äôve done the multiple turn ins and if you do it that way the process will be longer. Because you‚Äôre only getting rewarded that one time for completing that quest
---
Better than r/Fallout though.

Norwhal bacon sounds delicious.

I'm not sure if I got hit with a ban, but a reply got removed despite me either stating facts or cracking jokes at my own expense like how my biggest butthurt is the cost difference for access console vs pc.

At the end of the day, I'm not deleting my character and uninstalling, I've sunk too much into it, but I am seriouslly disappointed with Bethesdas tune switch. Between a stellar d&amp;d session irl then the emotional pitfall of the 1st sub being announced, I'm just sad. I'm not angry anymore. I'm just sad they chose this path
---
Super Mario has a casual mode. You cant die, and it helps you finish every level. Maybe that is more your speed.
---
As I've said in all these posts, and I'll continue to say - Bethesda doesn't care. They know you all caved by keeping this game alive as long as it has. They know many of you will cave and buy this subscription. Many of you will continue to cave and purchase from the atom shop.
---
But most importantly, you will all cave and preorder Elder Scrolls 6 BS $120.00 "mega roadmap edition" without even waiting for reviews.
---
Wallet votes and player numbers is all that matters. The fact that people are still playing this game gives Bethesda the resounding answer that this behavior is okay. It will continue in the future. FO76 was and is a huge market test. Bethesda has learned how low the standards of the gaming community truly are, and how quick we are to forget.
---
Not sticking to a roadmap by delaying promised content releases, player base complaining about poor quality/quantity loot drops, bugs not fixed, server issues, radio silence and now al lol this... FO76 is even starting to smell like Anthem.
---
Yes it is.
---
I actually had a better experience in adventure mode yesterday now that eveyone is crying about fallout 1st but still buying in and trying it out or just not playing. In regular adventure mode there were good players, we did 3 good queen runs and i ran around to some usual spawn points. All the lead weights were there and all the magazine spawns were around.
---
The company is the one that hires them, so they are the ones who have to pay them, not the playerbase who already payed to play.
---
BSG has to make money making great games, not great cashgrabs like this one and monetising as much features as they can.
---
Does it happen in adventure as well? I recently had a dude attacking my workshop and although I ripped through the first 75% of his health. He appeared to be unkillable. Now I know it could be a very strong bloodied/Unyielding build but he really didn't take any at all unless it was from the scorched who attacked the workshop as well. Which I could observe from higher up. It was at the red rocket truck stop.
---
*reads post* fair assumption
---
Nothing is devoid of criticism. It's so obvious even they know the game has problems and instead just stubbornly ignore them.
---
Pay $110 to be all alone in the same world they haven't added anything to? WHY would i do that? It's basically fallout without vendors....i don't see any appeal at all
---
Agreed and also a subscriber. The atoms were more than enough.
---
Yeah, man lol. From the canvas bag on this is about 2/3 negativity 1/3 positivity.
---
Repair kits only repair to 100%. I can do 200% at my workbench. No thank you. My stash is overflowing with scrap. 
---
Scrap kit is useless and does nothing because my stash is full. 
---
How am I a second class citizen? Lol
---
I just tested, my junk is gone.  It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúdisplay bug‚Äù for me.
---
Thanks! I honestly had no idea how many people can be in a server at a time up until now lol
---
That‚Äôs good. At level 3 class freak is there no negative at all?
---
The people who make SKSE since their copyrighted code was stolen? The lead dev of Skyrim Together was known for this shit, and he specifically was blacklisted from using SKSE code since he had done this. There is also the bulk of the Skyrim modding community since they don't support piracy.
---
I'm glad to see a vocal minority actually defending them. Bethesda is one of my favorite dev teams.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll test it when I play. Glad I disconnected my vending machines days ago (full caps)!
---
Ultimately the bottom line is what guides them.  Slowing sales in the Atom Shop is the only thing they will listen to.  Not people whining in a forum.
---
Bethesda does not give a shit. They only care about your money.
---
Between camp items and a few other cosmetics I find things I enjoy. But its not every month, and I don't plan on subscribing every month.  Only the months I plan on playing heavily.  I can skip a month and if I want to play, just play NW -or still play the game normally, the stashbox doesn't go away - you can take stuff out of it, just not put new stuff in it.  
---
And I don't disagree that the tent and scrapbox should be behind the paywall, I don't see why the tent couldn't have been added as an extended quest line of the boy scouts - and then sell on the atoms skins for the tent like they did with the backpack.  
---
The scrapbox might be a bit tougher - I know some people are saying they lied that the limit on stash was for server stability.  Maybe it was at one point.  Maybe it still is but the investment from the 1st subscribers allows them to pay for additional resources to cover it - I don't know.  That said I still think they could do some more to give out something to players.
---
I know I did. so did most other people warning you about the "slippery slope"
---
If you are a big fan of their work why not support them and buy the full game. 
---
If on a budget and don‚Äôt care you can do the game pass for $1 first month
---
Godmode is when they take NO damage at all, he could of been spamming nuka colas or stims if he actually took dmg, and after that 75% of health serendipity was probably activating left and right
---
Haha, so hostile! I dont expect you to be social anyway with what you described your game with.
---
Hope you meet some friends someday! :)
---
That‚Äôs good. at level 3 Class freak, do you still get a negative effect
---
Did you delete the characters too?
---
Also agree with this. 
---
If it is to continue existing, I would like a way to pack it up without having to redeploy it elsewhere.
---
Silence Todd
---
This is because they mmorpg the story to all hell that NPCs are collection bins. No one wanted any of this but people are happy with open morrowind multiplayer fork. Which doesn't even touch the single player part of the game.
---
It's time to wake up and smell the Rose's, this is what happens when you praise a company unable to fix bugs since oblivion to recent day. The same bugs people fix day 1 with mods.
---
Cod MW singleplayer is 10/10 too if any of you are into that
---
The beacons are lit! PRESTON GARVEY CALLS FOR AID!

Its not even burning dmg, its any enerdy weapons
---
I went to two locations for fusion cores to test this over 2 days, once they were both there and another they were gone, I didn‚Äôt take them but it was a new instance of the game. 
---
I think it‚Äôs RNG however like everything else. Today one is there the other isn‚Äôt. 
---
I think it‚Äôs more to prevent timed spawning and people farming locations.
---
I burned out back in May. Thanks for letting me know it's not worth returning.
---
Nah, if anything I noticed higher than average legendary spawns everywhere. For all the salt thrown, this patch seems to have been one of the better ones
---
How are they going to enjoy what they bought if it doesn't even work.
---
How and why are people still bothered by this game
---
I feel bad for the people that spend money on this game.  Obviously not right to tell someone how to spend their money but I find it really difficult to understand their thought process where you can do anything else with that money
---
Eat shit dumbass
---
I agree with mate üòú üëç
---
\------------------------------------------------------------------ 
---
Regarding recycled servers:
---
* Bethesda denied that players are getting used or recycled worlds: ***‚ÄúWhen a Fallout 1st member starts a Private World, a dedicated world is launched on an \[Amazon Web Services\] server. Players who have seen looted containers upon login may be experiencing the expected behavior upon log out and log in. Loot is instanced for each player in containers. As Fallout 76 players know, if you loot a container on one server, and then log out and log back in to another server, the container remains in a ‚Äòlooted‚Äô state for a period of time.‚Äù***
---
\-----------------------------------------------------------------
---
And the lie detector determined that THAT was a lie.  Two nights in a row, random power armor spawns have been empty on my so-called "fresh" servers.  I don't loot power armor.  so why would the frames be missing?  Also other world spawn loot that I never touch bc I don't need it I've noticed missing from locations.
---
Oh yes and if that's not bag enough, your scrap box will randomly delete stuff because it is bugged. So u spend $13 and loose all your junk.
---
I agree.  At what, $20 currently, I think that the game has quite a bit of enjoyment to it.  I'm not saying that some of the decisions that they are making are good, but I still think that it's clear that there are at least some people at Bethesda who worked on this game (especially the world and lore behind it) that really put some good effort into it.
---
At worst case, if you buy the game used and never buy any atoms then you get to play the game and you still get to give the finger to bethesda if that's your inclination.
---
See you in 25-40 hours, when there is nothing more to do in OW ;)
---
Did you delete the chacters too?
---
Well said.
---
Jesus this sub needs to get over itself. 
---
You're rantings and raving aren't as important as you think. Far less people care about Reddit than you think. You are a vocal minority. Bunch of people with too much time  in front if computers
---
hahahaha how delusional are you mate? "all content will be free" 100% means "we will never offer more QOL for $" it means that and then some, they are charging for content.. they refused the most requested feature (storage) under the premise that it would affect server stability and now are selling that exact same feature.. they said cosmetic only.. call me crazy.. i'm not talking pvp, again, not what's being argued.. although i'm glad to see you're so used to this argument you bring up other related problems.. it's not about pay to win, it's about it being non cosmetic mtx after stating definitively that it wouldn't happen. The heart of the promise.. my friend.. they have quite litterally back tracked on they're word, by a god damn landslide.
---
How about just paying for it and or move on from beating this horse?
---
Yea but they shouldve given these features to all. Im not paying 180$ a year on top of my xbox live on top of my 200$ copy of the game
---
God, I hope not. That woman's a loud one...
---
If your game needed a content update to attract players and thus churn more income from your virtual shop you would abso-fucking-lutely not delay that at the time of year when bigger releases beckon, especially when you consider that Bethesda have *nothing* coming over the seasonal period after the delay of Doom Eternal. Fallout 1st was a dice roll to see if it would bring home the bacon because a ‚Äòfree‚Äô update wouldn‚Äôt cut it and they fucked up another thing with FO76. All the media exposure is doing is pouring gas on a perpetual dumpster fire that‚Äôs only getting attention because to many the shitstorm is more entertaining than than the game.
---
Your response to my first post was nothing more than you saying you dont know how to play efficiently, and you called anyone using the subscription a cheater. I was not being hostile, but maybe did make an assumption upon you maturity level.
---
If the scrap can't be recovered, I would agree that anyone impacted by the bug should be compensated in some way.
---
If you watch the video, the theory is that Zenimax is pushing them to be pumping out numbers. With wastelanders delayed, this was probably suppose to launch with it and they promised Zenimax it would be out by a certain date so they had to launch it either way. And with the not listening to fans part, it could be the higher ups who aren't connecting to us and they are the ones pulling the strings. So it could not be Bethesda anyway and Zenimax is pushing for these money makers to make it look better to investors. Also, besides the backlash, I think the private servers are selling well since a ton of people on Xbox seem to have them.
---
Except they didn't lie, and nothing integral.to.the game is locked behind anything. Maybe your character's level, but that's an everybody thing. 
---
They promised that all DLCs would be free; they have been, and will continue to be. All they did was introduce a subscription to help with cash flow; let's be real, none of us ever bought Atoms on any kind if regular basis.
---
Yep. Saw it caused by a Tesla. The guy openly admitted he knew he was in god mode but continued to fight his opponents who couldn't hear him due to being in team or party chat.
---
Exactly. Anyone complaining now should have done the right thing in the first place and not bought the game.
---
Well said. I can a least respect your decision
---
^this
---
Plus this wasn't Bethesda's A-team it's actually a relatively inexperienced division based in Austin B-team Austin perhaps another word for the City of Austin Texas with the letter A any idea's,?
---
He refers to two modes being in beta , that being survival and NW, survival mode was removed like a month ago tho lmao
---
Why don't you ask around? Seems to me like there's plenty of people around here who love the game.
---
$8 a month is highway robbery? You need to stop playing video games and get a better job if $8 freaks you out
---
You got a point there. But i mean.. its called fallout 1st... class! So yeah, youre a second class player.
---
You cant go to your own world and farm as much Lead as you want. Lead was always a problem for me, not for those Who pay. The first class ones!
---
r/agedlikemilk
---
No sorry you‚Äôre a second class citizen as you are not as economically viable, welcome to modern AAA gaming.
---
"I really do want to love this game."
---
I hear you there. I love the world, the gameplay is fun, all that shit. It is a shame to see what they've done to it.
---
I have been VERY harsh on Bethesda from the beginning (I defended the game when people called it "garbage" though). I could see through their mask. After sinking a ton of hours into games like Path of Exile I can feel when a game is developed with love, this one was not. As fun as FO76 is, it is 100% a "Minimum Viable Product."
---
I want to love this game so much but I keep it at arm's length because I know what they're up to.
---
At times it can be a logical fallacy, but with things like politicians and corporations it rarely is. In this case Bethesda‚Äôs greed has been so blatantly obvious that it‚Äôs not a fallacy, it‚Äôs pattern recognition.
---
Remember, Bethesda has two major games on the way. Starfield and TES6. If you think this is purely a FO76 issue you are fucking kidding yourself. This is them testing the waters on how they can monetize those games. ‚ÄúOh, but they can‚Äôt offer a subscription for a single player game!‚Äù They are fucking selling a subscription right now to turn their MMO into a single player game.
---
I cant stop playing either man. IDC about the hate too much. I see everyone mad about private servers, but yet tons of my friendslist is people with private world's inviting people. I'm not getting it what so ever. And I've grown attached to the game. I cant give up this muscle memory I've been grinding for
---
I can far lead just fine in the public world though...
---
I hope not...
---
I think you maybe do not know the meaning of that word?
---
Content
---
That would be the missions, maps, and play modes of the game.  Tell me what mission I can do that you can't?
---
&gt;Your most positive, happy fans have turned on you almost immediately. 
---
From what I can see, the Filthy Casuals are still mostly filthy and still very casual. 
---
This sub is where people have called Bethesda employees 'fuckers' and 'assholes' for months and months, and acted as if that abuse was justified because something something video-games.  
---
There's a lot of great folk here, but let's not pretend it's been anything close to a beacon of positivity.
---
Dont forget the black market on ebay for god tier weapons and shit that was all obtained through Bethesdas own lack of security. They practically made the market themselves by leaving that room in the game.
---
No, they should not. That would take away from the perceived value of the subscription, and this game SORELY needs more cash flow.
---
I specifically said that sales numbers DO matter in my comment, just not as much as they used to. A game without MTX that still 10 million copies would probably make a lot less money than a game that sells 7 million copies but has MTX. Yes, those are made up numbers just to make a point.
---
Yes, I'm aware that legendary SBs were added as part of the patch.  
---
What I meant was that the Legendary SB during my QSB fight could have spawned before the Nuke and the start of the Scortched Earth quest as I dont know if all SBs near fissure Prime are reset after a nuke drop.
---
However, other responses confirmed that they do spawn during the event.
---
Okay, go submit a support ticket. No one here can compensate you.
---
IF Wastelanders doesn‚Äôt drop behind the Fallout 1st paywall - great way to get players to subscribe right there before the fiscal year ends if you‚Äôre short of your financial targets. Don‚Äôt be surprised.
---
Someone actually gave gold to this post LMFAO.
---
Just imagine the cringe of even writing up this post. It‚Äôs like trying to walk down a catwalk gracefully while getting pelted at with rotten eggs.
---
No response to my ticket and it‚Äôs been nearly 24 hours.
---
Exactly...not sure what the other guy is on about lol.
---
I know how to do all of those things, all the spawns are static effectively, I'm sure i could solo the queen... but why? These aren't sandbox aspects really... sandbox aspects involve imagination &amp; what-if scenarios etc. creating networks, growing &amp; maintaining something with an unknown future...
---
What you're looking at are "completionist" concepts, which aren't very fun or interesting if that's all we have. Fallout 4 had a true sandbox element to it after nukaworld &amp; some truly brilliant mods.
---
They should make it into an atom subscription, no problem with that
---
Yeah and if your on PS4 look me up before you go and give me your legendary‚Äôs and godrolls plus your legacies!!! Somence your uninstalling and all!
---
I think that sums it up nicely. Someone shelling out $15-$20 a month is definitely not a whale, far from it. The sub as it stands, just taking the atoms by themselves, looks like a good buy for the users that like a monthly purchase from the shop. That, as you say, is the primary target market for it. Those that want an influx of monthly currency - the rest of the stuff on offer is there to help sweeten the deal to those users, so to speak.
---
Another title I play is Star Trek Online and that's a game where taking a quote from Star Trek 4 "Captain, there be whales here!" is both a pun and a statement of fact. They're the players keeping the game afloat and if you called someone there spending that amount each month a whale, you'd be laughed at.
---
A whale is someone that's there for every single promotion and will think nothing of dropping hundreds - if not thousands in some cases - of pounds/dollars/whatever seemingly on a whim to get whats on offer.
---
Yeah I bet they love getting their scrap removed and entering private worlds that are already looted and repeating the same grinding routine.
---
You talk to me like I haven't played the game.
---
One of the issues is they've had a year already and all they have done is make things worse, not better. It's a 'single player' kind of game with multiplayer stapled on IMO. As in, that's how it feels to me. It's different to any of their other games in genera, like Fallout or TES, other than Fallout 4 which was a progression toward more of a shooter than RPG and 76 keeps that going. I personally much rather the RPG in the older games to this shooting looting. This being said, I rarely play MMORPG's and MMO shooters are just boring AF to me, but that's besides the point.  
---
I was more interested in where the line was, as in; when do you say "enough is enough, wtf is this Bethesda? why are you trying to break your own legs with the most greedy version of each implementation you stick in? What happened to the 'free updates, the MTX will pay for it, the shop will always be cosmetic only, free offline mod / private servers', now we have to pay for everything, you break all of your promises?"   
---
In the end, what is their word worth anymore? Can we, should we even try to trust them? At what point are we sick of them pushing things, just to see how far they can go?
---
Sayonara
---
I can't believe that people think removing junk will add more than 20 or so "complex" items in the recently vacated space.
---
&gt;A lot of content is locked behind microtransactions.
---
That's clearly not true, no quests or locations or anything other than a fridge are locked behind a pay wall ffs
---
Cute how you even tell Bethesda to pay close attention, as if they would really read it or especially give a fuck about what you think of Bethesda. hahaha real good joke man.
---
As long as you morons buy their products, they will continue to rip you off and dissappoint you. Because.... IT WORKS! Just like with EA's DLC and pay to win politics. You idiots buy and support it, so its working, and they are increasing their bullshit tactics.
---
But you guys really think posting on reddit will achieve anything and Bethesda will change their ways... yeah sure buddy, you are a real dreamer, arent you? 
---
So shut your fucking mouth if you still buy and play it, no matter how shitty the games are. You are part of the problem.
---
Well, i'm sure you spent hundreds of hours playing this game, most of us dont have the time to get to where youre at. I work 7 to 4, i only play 3-4 hours a week. I'll never get to where youre at. Ever.
---
Now any level can do what you earned. Doesnt that frustrate you?
---
Jesus Christ, the two worst things in the world side by side. The fucking Star Wars Prequels and Fallout 76. It can't get any better than this. XD
---
Why are you people still playing this game? Honestly I just dont understand. Please help me understand.
---
The only people who can join your private session are people in your friends list.  Are you sure you selected "private" when you went on to play? 
---
As for the worlds being picked clean, some loot is tied to you as a character.  If you had say, gone through white springs picking up all the golf outfits, then when you log onto a private server those won't be back until the respawn timer for your character has returned. 
---
But going back to the first question, were you sure you were on a private session?
---
Bye bye now. Just quit we don‚Äôt want your negativity.
---
With their inability to read their fans, there's no way in hell I would buy their stock.
---
Might short it though.
---
They run out of an AWS cloud -- so it's all virtual on-demand servers.  You can see this by just sniffing the IP of your server while you play, and doing a DNS reverse lookup.  It goes into the ec2 cloud.
---
There is a LOT of conspiracy-mongering going on, with little real facts.  No, Bethesda did not shutdown survival just so they could re-use the servers for this. When servers are spun up and down on-demand, you just make new ones as needed.
---
Yeah been playing it, average at best IMO, a good effort but longevity wise it‚Äôs already wearing on me.
---
It is just speculation on my part, I don't think it would shut down soon, it just got me thinking. Regardless of if it's next year or 10 years away, it is inevitable, unless FO76 morphs into a much larger world over time with much more content, it won't have long term users or enough new users to keep it going. Many people have already "finished" the game. What would they get from a subscription? So as users finish the game and get bored, the user base will die out, unlike an MMO which is somewhat eternal just because of the more fleshed out grind, loot, guild and quest content.  
---
So they'll need constant content updates like Wastelanders to keep people subscribed, to keep enough money coming in and to keep people playing. I absolutely want it to keep going and be successful, it would be a dream scenario for the world to grow over time to include more Fallout lore and locations in some kind of Fallout "Forever Game". But I also want to know if I can keep playing the game anyway, should that not eventuate.
---
I suspect it eventually will be availible to everyone. All current Fallout 1st subscribers are basically paying Bethesda to beta test the scrap box and other items.
---
Saying "some" here is another way to say "between 1 and all."
---
I've definitely seen it mean "most" before, when it's used at my work. We'll never know the impact for sure.
---
I strongly disagree with you. This game have a good storyline, perhaps more lore than another Fallout (strikes, robots who "steal the jobs", a senator who discover te Enclave conspiracy, post apocalyptic organisations and their relations, until their collapse because of a threat.)   
---
It's a good game, but released too soon, and "controlled" by people who only think about money.
---
^^this
---
Right who cares? Lame.
---
I keep seeing these posts, but what I haven't seen is any proof. No screenshots, no videos. Nothing.
---
Also, your loot table is 200 items long, and carries over from regular servers. So if you looted a magazine in one spot on Adventure, then started a private server, that magazine is still gone until the global reset. This is a good thing. This keeps people with private servers from having any kind of an unfair advantage.
---
Pete deserves every bit as much of a reputation for being a pathological liar as Todd. He's just not the public face.
---
Probably because the majority of people left on the servers are people that would pay for such a thing. Most of us who don't like the money grab left the game. I know I did.
---
Unique stuff is available by completing events. Some events are better than others for this. Seasonal events usually give the most unique items.
---
Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmkay...
---
I think people underestimate just how much the Scrapbox changes your playing habits too.  If you like to hoard stuff, now you have a reason to pull everything off every table, like you did in Fallout 4.
---
Join r/Fallout76FilthyCasuals
---
I guess you have to, yeah.
---
This argument is such bullshit because literally anyone can go on Twitch and see for themselves the quality of a game.
---
"But you don't know how it FEELS man!"
---
Stop referring to the servers as private servers, they are objectively NOT private servers. Stop giving them the gratification of perpetuating their blatant lie.
---
Some of us actually posted here suggesting a subscription lol
---
My first few hours exploring was like a wave of nostalgia from the New Vegas days, in yet Outer Worlds still has an 'original' feel to it. Im impressed so far
---
Lol I‚Äôm not the one crying about a game update I can‚Äôt afford like it‚Äôs Bethesda‚Äôs fault lmao that‚Äôs straight up pathetic.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs someone just venting and now is a perfect time lmao
---
I actually wouldn't have a problem with Fallout First if it didn't offer improved gameplay like the Scrap Box.
---
You should be angry if you bought this game.
---
But people are not free to talk about other topics outside F76? After all, Outer Worlds was made from people who MADE Fallout. Not destroyed it.
---
I agree, maybe I should edit the first part?
---
for most people i think the issue is with the additional benefits to Fallout 1st other than private servers.
---
Nah we good. Servers are full of fun people right now I hope the rest of you actually quit.
---
I really ain't mad either. Just disappointed.
---
Honestly with how much Bethesda has messed up, they should be giving us the subscriptions for free. They should also fix their game so other people might want to play it but they keep adding items that cost real money.
---
1) You were in a public server, asking people if they bought the subscription which gives them access to a private server and you think your data has any meaning? 
---
\-I have apx. 400 people on my friends list, about 10% of them are on at any one point. More during peak hours. In the last two days I've seen about 30-50% of the online people in a Private server (NOT counting people visiting private). So if you figure 15 people per 400 is about 4%. That's not a bad start. Obviously the numbers will go down next month.
---
2) You think $12 is a lot of money and people who decide to spend that are whales?
---
\-Looking at the 4% number from above, that represents more than whales. Next month will be interesting, to see how the numbers change. But $12/month is nothing for most gamers. 
---
3) You think a company should care about anyone who openly admits that their wallets are closed? You do get Bethesda is a for profit company right??
---
\-Please start up a business, buy land, buildings, and equipment. Then hire people, have advertising costs, R&amp;D costs, health care costs. And then tell me how much you plan to focus on people who aren't paying you money. 
---
Get real!!
---
I wouldn't call them someone who let themself be robbed. It's more like someone who let himself be robbed *and then tracked down the robber to give him some more money*
---
What about keeping gameplay mechanics out of mtx?
---
üëç You're welcome
---
Looking forward to OW and CoD, Death Stranding up next.  I don't hate Fallout 76 but after 900 hours I'm bored.  I'll just watch from afar and see how the game improves.
---
That‚Äôs all fine and good. I‚Äôm not here to shame anyone. I‚Äôd just rather see people do something about it than sit around and whine. It accomplished nothing and really pigeonholes the sub.
---
Look up Stockholm syndrome and you‚Äôll understand why most people DEFEND this game.
---
It‚Äôs one thing to enjoy it, it‚Äôs another thing to defend it. You can enjoy a game and admit it‚Äôs bad at the same time. Like I loved the game Battleborn but it ultimately failed and basically nobody plays it anymore. I personally enjoyed it and thought it was great but can admit why it failed overall. The problem is you won‚Äôt find that in this sub. Nobody can admit the flaws since launch while saying they enjoy the game. 
---
All in all, if you‚Äôre asking why people still play- it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre having fun and find enjoyment out of it, which no matter how big of a failure the game is overall people can still find it fun especially since it‚Äôs carrying lore from a very successful line of the Fallout franchise.
---
Even if we boycott it, they will do something to make it better.....but then do it again.
---
Wait, what? They're charging you $100 a year or more for private servers that aren't private!?
---
I know I shouldn't be surprised by this but god DAMN.
---
So you either agree, or are mad that my comparison is on point and you can't argue it. Otherwise I'm willing to listen to actual arguments against my point!
---
1. No new content.
---
2. No perk management system.
---
3. Raids were onerous and unrewarding.
---
4. Survival mode started. Then it had no role in the game. There was no vision for it. No plan. So they just deleted it.
---
5. Stats and damage change randomly. 
---
6. Legacy weapons in PvP...
---
7. Countless little quality of life bugs that will never get fixed. (e.g. when I first log in I can't fast travel to my camp. The clicking doesn't work...)
---
I started playing Borderlands 3. There is no comparison. Its a polished game that's a ton of fun. Go play another game for a while and come back to 76. That feeling is what I mean by broke.
---
^This
---
The problem arises when the precedent set here affects future games that you might actually want to play. What happens when another company follows the trend of 76 and turns one of your favourite franchises into mud? Or when Bethesda themselves dilute Starfield and ES6 and push microtransactions into a single player game and wonderful free modding out?
---
I do like the suggestion, boycott or shut up. It gets to the point. No time for tea
---
I don‚Äôt hope anyone quits. I just don‚Äôt want to see whining down the entire sub. Better organize the complaints and keep the main sub clean.
---
Sounds good champ
---
Nah
---
I'm vastly enjoying playing on a quiet rando-free server with my crew.  :)
---
Bethesda did create and code the Scrap Box which does not work properly and you have to pay real life money for it.  Imagine paying for a box that eats all the Scrap you saved.
---
Bethesda also restricted the not so Private Servers to accommodate only 8 players.  
---
And something tells me that Zenimax is not in charge of how Bethesda makes money.  They just tell them to make more money.  Bethesda deciding to take community suggestions and monetizing them is probably their idea.  I am unsure about Fallout 1st though because it is eerily similar to ESO+.
---
Or they just don't post about it....Not everyone who plays a game will post about it on reddit 24/7.
---
why wouldnt they,they let modders upload mods for there other games
---
Delete your characters in a video... go ahead show us... we‚Äôll wait...
---
A beacon of positivity? This post and its upvotes really prove the outrage here has nothing to do with the players and everything to do with a rabid internet mob desperately trying to squeeze one last controversy out of this game
---
it won't be $120 it will be $60, but yeah I will be buying it on release, you can judge me all you want but generally speaking, bethesda release good games, this was a miss, but on the whole I couldn't give a fuck. I will still buy elder scrolls 6 and fallout 5, this is a given. I doubt they will try something like this again for a single player game anyway.
---
Bye Felicia!
---
Obviously that's what fallout 1st is for.
---
The game sucks they shouldn‚Äôt be asking for anymore money at this point they should actually be kissing the consumers ass and not the other way around
---
Riding in a car is not the same experience as driving it.
---
"Preaching" is a very apt word to use when discussing Bethesda and fans of 76.
---
Lol well that's true. It's the "harder daddy" kind of guy. But I still blame on Bethesda higher ups more than anyone.
---
I‚Äôm so against the whole idea, but you just sold me a subscription
---
Really? I even googled the best locations to farm, but its 90% of the time, empty. A 1st class citizen wouldnt have that experience anymore.
---
arent the whales here in this context investors (providence) and big fish like zenimax? not customers but those who expect the money?
---
we need r/FO76_2ndClass
---
Crazy.  It's almost as if the way other people play the game has no effect whatsoever on your gameplay experience.  Imagine that.
---
I would say yes definitely worth is. Yes there are bugs and issues but you will get 100's of hours of gameplay for a small price.
---
The one who allows themselves to be robbed entices further robbing though. The gullible nature of 76 players is going to cast a very wide and bad ripple effect for Bethesda for years to come. And it will be the consumer's fault.
---
Huh, didn't know that; so far I've only seen it triggered by that burning dmg.
---
Then that concern - I think - could be better voiced and supported through a concerted effort combining a pinned post and an organized boycott. Keeps the sub clean and takes action based on the issues.
---
What are you even talking about? Don‚Äôt you know it just works?
---
The thing people keep forgetting about Fortnite is that the basic gameplay is solid, the game actually works when you go to play, and the cosmetics are creative and high quality. The Battlepass is similar, there‚Äôs a lot of stuff in it and while there is a lot of worthless crap, provided you play it regularly you‚Äôre getting several skins, emotes, and wraps each season for $10. Fortnite deserves a lot of shit, but they get a lot of stuff right.
---
In contrast, Bethesda seemed to figure reselling people cosmetics from FO4 would be a gold mine and they could put out a monthly subscription that was really just ransoming requested features behind a paywall. They were expecting Fortnite money but were only willing to put out maybe 1% of the effort.
---
Bethesda wrote fo76 off a long time ago when it bombed at release. It's been a desperate money grab ever since to milk out whatever cash they can until they can get something they're more serious about out.
---
&gt;"It's wacky-ness is what made fallout 2 a nice sequel. I liked it I don't know why you even have a problem with that part,"
---
Nah, it's just that this crap constantly comes up.  "It's not a real Fallout because it was made by Bethesda."  Even though it's total rubbish, I'm stating the fact that Fallout 1 &amp; Fallout 3 had the most similarity in design, whereas Fallout 2 &amp; Fallout: NV were the most similar.
---
&gt;"Also OtW is a spiritual successor to fallout, but it's how you look at it,"
---
No it's not.  Literally that requires the mental gymnastics of: "Oh, it's made by Obsidian and Obsidian was formed by the original creators of Fallout, even though the the number of original creators is nearly nonexistent anymore it's the name that matters."

It's a very writing centered level compact RPG based in space with numerous companions you can choose to pick up along the way with numerous alterations to the ending merely based on the heaps and heaps of decisions you can make.  I'd say it has a fair bit in common with Mass Effect, especially the level designs.

Luck only affects weapon condition

Please don't buy this, the private servers apparently aren't even private.
---
I know you want it, and I don't fault you for wanting it, but we cannot let them know that we will fall for this horseshit.
---
Oh the game is absolutely brutal until you raise your weapon skills and realize you have to carry armorer's tools all the time in your travels to fix your equipment.
---
I have a sneaking suspicion that the Filthy Casuals are upset, too. But you get suspensions for whining about the game, so...
---
Yep. Gaming is doomed because of the gamers.
---
You don‚Äôt seem to understand how *long* ago these discussions were. I‚Äôd say it was a solid 12 years ago. Chances are good you weren‚Äôt old enough to even know what the hell the ‚Äúslippery slope‚Äù is. 
---
As soon as ‚ÄúGames as a service‚Äù became a thing, I became way more cautious of anything multiplayer, as did literally everybody else. As soon as Fallout 76 was announced, I had a strong feeling this is what it would turn into.
---
They've bubble-gummed the whole thing. They foolishly listen to people asking for easier and better everything, eventually erasing all challenge &amp; making "managing stash size" the prime annoying challenge. All the additional content has been "gimmick" variety stuff. They eliminated survival mode, which had the best chance of becoming something realistic &amp; fear inducing. Now i just traipse around basically invulnerable, with more junk than i can sell, carry or stash. FO4 survival mode was far better, especially after mods like "settlers". This game is going the wrong direction.... the "jar-jar binxification", if you will.
---
A small minority does that while the majority is probably losing interest.
---
I‚Äôll admit to being mildly intrigued by the Wastelanders expansion and was wondering if 76 might actually pull a bit of a No Man‚Äôs Sky. They will not.
---
It was mine, too. Until they introduced paid mods and released the Fallout 1st.
---
Lucky hole is empty?
---
I think there's still a lot of years left in the game. The hate will die down as it always does.
---
There's still 2 vaults to be opened, Wastelanders and much more coming. The game is evolving but everyone is getting roughed up a bit in the process. 
---
There's a ton of potential in this game hopefully they figure out how to make it reach said potential. If they do the game will be here for a long time.
---
honestly, I doubt they will try this for a single player game, there's no point generally, I still support them and hope they turn themselves around. I don't agree with what they are doing however and it will cost them dearly in future endeavors.
---
U mad brah?
---
To be honest, this is my second character. I started over because I wanted to do the main missions after level 50.  It took 1 weekend to get there. It took me about 4 hours to get to the point to do ammo runs. 
---
No not frustrated at all. 
---
In fact I often help players, showing them easier ways to do stuff.  Or find myself talking with other players after battles, learning from them.  Having better players around you is a good thing.
---
I want everyone around me to be as strong as possible. The only competition in this game is with online jerks.
---
haha yeah.. in this context it means what the game 'contains', I didn't say map, I didn't say play modes, I didn't say missions. I said "content" which includes but is not limited to.. storage space available, additional fast travels, private (but not really) servers,  
---
You think quality of life improvements aren't part of a game's content? awesome, i'm debating with someone who doesn't even understand basic english..
---
Oh no, I absolutely disagree with that xD The Prequels I find FAR better than the Original Trilogy, but only if including the Clone Wars animated movie and show. If you don't include that, I'll say they're on par with each other because people don't judge the Originals because of nostalgia but they had PLENTY of boring parts, cringy parts, and just straight up plot holes and ignorance, like the storm troopers who were looking for the intruders on the Death Star, the commanding officer said, "Blast them," gets blasted, and ALL the troopers run away without ever blasting anyone, even though they also had MORE numbers than the intruders. That's because of "plot armor" which is much less seen in the Prequels, but again, I'll admit the Prequels and Original Trilogy BOTH have a ton of problems on par with each other, unless you include the Animated Clone Wars. That movie PLUS the show is probably some of the best Star Wars content I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Of course there will be some boring episodes but then there are Episodes with fight scenes that Rival the Duel of The Fates in Episode One or the Episode 3 fights as well. As well the show does what the prequels couldn't do, they made politics INTERESTING, and if you watch the show you'll realize what I mean. If you haven't, please do watch the show x) I hated how the animation looked at first so I didn't give it a chance, until I decided I might as well try it out and it is ACTUAL Star Wars content. I also feel the Anakin voice actor is FAR superior to the live action actor who always sounded depressed and angry, and Anakin wasn't meant to always be like that. He has much more of a personality, and you see his dark and light side in the show and you see how he changes throughout the course of the war. There's SO much detail in the show and characters made for the show like Ahsoka and Rex are some of THE best Star Wars characters I've ever had the pleasure of getting to know. 
---
_______________
---
I will admit Episode 2 is the WORST Star Wars movie though (not including Disney's crap of course) xD
---
If you want full kind of solo play that's gonna be 12.99/month or 99.99/year
---
Bioware quite literally has no claim to any of the world or fallout IP. 
---
Originally fallout was Tim Cains little quiet project that slowly gained traction from his coworkers at Interplay. None of those people are still at bioware or obsidian.
---
Time to make friends with subs in every time zone! :D
---
Thank you! I literally did not know this was an option, and after reading your post I subscribed to the PC beta game pass, and realized how many games I want to play are there. (Including TOW.)
---
Brace yourself I said something similar earlier lol.
---
This is great idea. 
---
Unfortunately everybody who bought fo1st will do that.
---
agreed, but people will still post outside of it. Best just to ignore them.
---
You know you're basically an addict at this point. So sad, I feel pity for you and your bank account.
---
Free to play you say. Evil laugh üòà
---
"Bethesda's"hold my beer üç∫
---
Well done
---
why would he lose his time downloading/installing the last patch + login in when you can just uninstall in 10 seconds ?
---
"... downwote &amp; cry", "Admins can you do something?". Good for you that you're different.
---
"Just buy our new 'bugfix 1st' subscription in addition to our 'money 1st' subscription in order to receive priority bugfixes for the bugs you might be experiencing right now!"
---
And of course now we know why lootbags where designed so hard to find...
---
Let me add, there are multiple instances of people copying and pasting posts back and forth between here and the main Fallout subreddit.  People are double posting not even to rant but to just try and stir up trouble at this point.
---
I'll admit it I never really got in to 76.  But this, this isn't even reasonable anymore, it's just a crappy hate fest.
---
you serious??? lol
---
Gotcha. I popped in after drinking with some buddies and bought a silver trailer thing....the fuck was I thinking...other than a waste of atoms what is is it good for
---
Not really just over people whinging
---
No, all games are definitely NOT like where this one's going.
---
Let me rephrase. There's not a legal way to draw a line.
---
THIS...so true
---
I feel Mass Effect meets Fallout
---
Sure you are lol
---
I think in China they don't have this problem.
---
So you thought everything available would be completely free for everyone forever? You seem to be short some basics too...
---
They have a good reason for it...
---
*snickers* Smartassery! Upvotes for the laugh!
---
Not the first time, won't be the last. I love the people saying "I'm out ******'s" with zero post history in this sub or any other fallout sub. But a suspicious about of post history in FortniteBR....
---
Could you not be an ass...thanks!
---
bug fixes are 11.99, sorry /s
---
It‚Äôs not a hate group, people are upset at how they‚Äôve been wronged by a company who they used to trust because of their past work. And now they go the route of EA despite what longtime fans want, if your not concerned about Bethesda‚Äôs future go play fortnight or something because this company is ruining itself while some people stand and applaud,
---
Ya they are going to lose a ton of players if they keep quality of life changes locked behind paywalls.
---
500 Atoms sounds good to me.
---
What they said\^
---
Good
---
There are plenty of good games out there that aren't as heavily monetized by their publisher/studio. Stop blaming the players for publisher greed.
---
I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôve played all the fallout games except 76. I‚Äôm not jumping in on a game that takes micro transactions and a subscription in addition to a triple A game price to deliver an underfinished game. I appreciate this entire cautionary tale of a subreddit.
---
Please get back on track Bethesda, you started getting off tract when you told people to pay for content in the shape of a seasons pass and then did the creation club bait and switch. Now nobody trusts your season pass, you claim no more charges after purchase price yet again, and somehow go one worse with a subscription fee that doesn‚Äôt really do anything. 
---
This is how classics burn out before fading away.
---
Has anyone from Bethesda replied in any of the threads since the private servers were announced?
---
Other people are hosting them for their other games.
---
Echochambers are great arent they
---
I know most of the folks inherently drawn to this sub will disagree, but I'll risk the downvotes.
---
76 would have hadn't a much longer , healthier life, and larger population if it were 100% survival, with PVP as its main draw - a la 2007 runescape where you drop most of your stuff on death.
---
It's entirely possible that you, yourself, wouldn't like to play a game like that. But I'm betting two or three other folks, who don't want to play a game like *this*, would be interested.
---
Then the private servers would have been the "escape" from pvp where you get to explore without fear of dying, or complete quests with friends. 
---
Years from now, once devs have moved on to different studios and projects, I would put money on the fact that someone will say "yeah, it was always meant to be pvp, but we pivoted at the last minute due to public outcry". 
---
Most of the pre-release outcry was from folks who didn't want multiplayer at all, and were giving reasons to make it single player by default. These folks never bought a copy, anyway.
---
Your respect isn't needed nor required since it clearly has no value whatsoever, respect is based on a persons values and personality, their purchase and playing of a game doesn't mean they shouldn't be respected. Your sentiment about bethesda may be correct about this game, but you forget they also put out other games which have been good recently, wolfenstein and the like.  I am not going to boycott a company over 1 failure, you have lost my respect because of your attitude to other people you do not know.
---
I do like the game don‚Äôt get me wrong at all I just don‚Äôt like the road Bethesda has gone down. Also Todd said all cosmetic items would be unlock able through gameplay which was a lie.
---
Maybe it needs to be accompanied by a rule: Posts about Fallout 1st in the pinned thread only. That strategy worked wonders over at r/woodworking when 1,000 people a week were showing up just to ask the community to ID some scrap wood they found. Now it‚Äôs all confined to a pinned thread that - I think - gets purged weekly.
---
This is exactly what I was telling a buddy. It's like we're pioneers starting a new colony and up pops a walmart.
---
You are welcome for my service.
---
I'm not sure what there is to agree with. I'm personally against Fallout 1st, but this is just nonsensical rambling.
---
How dafuq is this anything like a fictional movie character slaughtering kids? Lol
---
Beyond that, you said he did it as a morally twisted sense of Mercy. Bethesda hasn't fooled themselves into thinking they're helping anyone out here. They just want more money. Lol
---
Well, you still haven't encountered the reasons that fuel the hate, so it's not the worst time. But not the best time either. However if you are on PC I could provide some items or assistance to make your time bearable. Although the first levels and immersion are irreplacable, so it's your decision.
---
When it comes to 76 agreed. It was so bad when 76 came out I just unsubed and never looked back.
---
look through my reddit history
---
Honestly, as soon as I heard that Bethesda was handling the servers I knew things would be fucked. That basically meant no mods, no unofficial patches, etc.
---
And then, as you said, they MMORPGd the single player aspect to hell. They took the thing that gave their worlds life and yeeted it right out the fucking window.
---
üëç Cheers
---
Same as me, they go down easy.
---
I don't understand what you guys aren't getting üòÜ your rust server is a virtualized server, there are many of those rust servers running on one dedicated server, I was just trying to point out they never offered dedicated servers and people keep coming in with virtualized and shared examples, that was precicley my point
---
Thank you for your 100 dollars, here is a lazy fortnight.
---
I honestly hope your right, but with micro transactions making there way into so many single player games these days, I think I will definitely wait until after the release to make a decision on what to purchase.
---
Hot damn there‚Äôs my olive branch. I could kiss you.
---
It's really always been the lack of test servers that kills me.  I feel like if they were there from the start, we'd have more content.  BGS spends too much time chasing their tales that I'm sure it's tough to develop something new.
---
They mentioned in another thread that they are allowing a controlled burn right now to allow folks to (constructively) vent their frustrations.  When it's time to button it up, they're going to make a sticky.
---
It can affect future titles from Bethesda. It can encourage them to further distance the free and wonderful modding scene around these games, with true creativity and genius at play, in exchange for microtransactions, subscriptions and the stripping out of content for Starfield, Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5. So it can in fact have a very damaging effect on future titles, and actual games unlike this trash.
---
When it stops being fun for me. Idgf about the sub...i may buy a month or not havent decided. Id rather them delay WL and make it better.
---
Peace, brother ‚úåüòé
---
Almost sounds like an in game advantage that you paid for... nah, it'll be fine.
---
Pretty obvious that you don't get it, so I'm not gonna sit here and spell it out for you.
---
That's cool if it wasn't for you. I personally did not get into Witcher III, but I believe everyone else who said it's great. I think it helped for me that I played Morrowind when it first came out and the kind of creature comforts emblematic in today's games like click-to-travel and accurate quest markers were not yet a thing. I also really got into the lore and felt personally connected to the main quest struggle between the Temple and the dissident priests. The local map in Morrowind is god awful. If by "big city" you mean Vivec, the NYC of Elder Scrolls cities, it is very difficult to navigate even for someone experienced with the game. I appreciate you tried it and your criticism is valid. If you don't like wandering around aimlessly for hours, it's good you didn't get to the part in the main quest where you have to go to the Cave of the Incarnate. Oblivion is great, I certainly like it more than Skyrim.
---
I did lol don‚Äôt see proof
---
How great an idea is it though? In my experience at least 1 out of every 3 player vendors is selling most of the games items for dirt cheap anyway. Ammo at 1cap, Stimpacks at 1cap, 3 stars for under 1k. It's so frequent that I'm shocked when ever I see that guy selling all his stuff for 1k-10k. But there's always 1 in each server.
---
The publishers deserve it.
---
I havent lost anything. I'm stating that there should be compensation for the time it takes them to fix this bug thats impacting people are paying for.
---
I think Bethesda realizes 2 things:
---
1.) Their brand is shit until they release the next Skyrim. 
---
And
---
2.) There's a small group of players who play this game that'll buy whatever Bethesda slaps a Fallout label on.
---
So honestly, what does Bethesda have to lose by taking a crap in a can, labeling it "Fallout First" and making millions off it... because enough players will buy it. Their brand can't get any worse, most of the gaming community thinks they're scum. They'll just bank on Starfield or Elder Scrolls 6 to get everyone back while milking the few whales who play this game.
---
Ahh I see it now
---
I'm dead.
---
Basically the other sub. They have to be some of the most dim, ignorant people I have ever seen.
---
TLDR: I'm not part of the "we" referenced herein, but I wholeheartedly propose your best and most visible action is to actually **stop playing** because nobody making decisions is reading this sub or these posts. 
---
I'm all for stopping the bitching and consolidating this conversation. It would be nice to get back to helping people with actual problems in the game or discussing griefing and pvp.
---
"Bethesda" is not actively reading this sub. Their community reps may be glancing at it but the only active reading going on is raw analytic data that we frankly don't have access to. They have numbers showing how many people are playing, and how many of those people have paid for the service. That is going to tell them everything they need to know and they just aren't going to share it with us. Of course, even if they did share it, their numbers would be disputed if they did not fall in line with what people wanted to see. 
---
With that being the reality, your best course of action is to do exactly what people have been threatening to do or claiming they are doing: **stop playing**. Nothing else will get their attention as quickly nor as effectively. 
---
I conclude my attempt at another civil discussion on the manner which will surely be downvoted to hell simply because I do not agree and the subscription service does not upset me.
---
Dont play anygame that has any form of crafting and resource gathering if you wana be morally consistant.
---
Well again, it‚Äôs a distribution issue. When people mod a Skyrim game, they typically mod it however they want and then start playing. If you‚Äôve got 100 different private servers with 100 different mod configurations, you‚Äôre going to have to download all those mods for each server you join. It becomes a huge bandwidth issue. That‚Äôs not something Bethesda‚Äôs had to deal with before.
---
You just said the game sucks? I am personally fine with utility items being in the shop.  Currently I don‚Äôt feel at any disadvantage.As long as they stick by their guiding principles that they outlined last week inside the vault I am OK. The only thing that worries me right now is the scrap box.
---
That‚Äôs pretty typical Bethesda, they are shockingly lazy for a AAA developer. The entire Fallout First program was just minimal effort for maximum gain. However we‚Äôre now seeing Bethesda‚Äôs other defining trait, gross incompetence. Even what little effort they put forth‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt work. They somehow managed to make just removing the stash junk limit delete your junk. The deployable campsite in a game that already has deployable, user made structures crashes the game. The ‚Äúprivate‚Äù worlds are both not private but they‚Äôre not even new, they literally couldn‚Äôt even be assed to just reset the instance when giving it to a PAYING customer. Their ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù cosmetic is ANOTHER asset flip from a previous, better game. They couldn‚Äôt even take people‚Äôs money properly because they wouldn‚Äôt let people subscribe which I can‚Äôt really decide if it‚Äôs a bug or a feature. I mean it‚Äôs Bethesda so bug but still...
---
Eso went this way and its super popular.
---
The ones that survive get jobs. This is how Bethesda grows.
---
This has been a weird quirk about the normal CAMP too since launch.  You're always relocating it, never storing it.
---
Apparently you are the 12 year old since you don't know how actual debate / discussions work. And that's fine, why would someone who is a joke take me seriously? I don't take you seriously either haha. You've already proven that by continuing to make empty claims you can't prove, or counter a single one of my arguments. Yeah, if you claim something, you have the burden of proof, or did you not learn a thing in school? Maybe you need to repeat. Or maybe you literally are 12 hahaha
---
Sure thing did thr flier nerf need to happen yah they were brokenly op did the quetzal get nerfed too hard yah it did
---
Dude, SC is a scam if I've ever seen one. I'll eat my shoe if the game ever gets a proper official released.
---
&gt;The game is stunning
---
Not stunning enough to warrant THOUSANDS of dollars price tag on some of their ships.
---
&gt;and if it was a scam it is a poorly executed one.
---
Actually it's the opposite. A good scam is the one that looks legitimate until it's too late.
---
I love this üòÇ I love when I see people come into my camp and close the door on the way out.
---
Oh no, heaven forbid Bethesda hires mod authors to create micro dlc for Fallout 4 while they work on new games. You're a fucking dunce man. Just say you're poor so we can all confirm what we already know.
---
You log off and anyone else not paying is booted so they can use the resources for hosting other players. Plus unconfirmed reports of places being looted and enemies already being found dead, and some reports of people being dropped into private games uninvited.
---
Best purchase ever made..... ever
---
Hope ya dont play any other fallout game or rpg for that matter.
---
Right on lol
---
Level 27 and haven't set up camp once. Didn't like it much in F4 either. I'm seeing if I can reach end game without setting up camp once.
---
‚ÄúADMINS! PEOPLE ARE VOICING THEIR DISPLEASURE! BAN THEM AT ONCE SO I DON‚ÄôT HAVE TO DO ANY THINKING!‚Äù
---
I think it needs some more patches, but almost every game is constantly getting patched. As for boring, it's my favorite and I play it almost daily still. I don't find it boring at all.
---
you forget they also have bills to pay and need to pay developers to produce new content and fix things, they put all of their resources into wastelanders and have delayed it to ensure that is is good enough for release. fallout 1st may be a money gaining tactic but you fail to understand that most MMOs (it's essentially what it is), have a content paywall, Destiny, GW2, FFXIV,m WoW etc. this is an optional paywall which I won't be paying for, but people will and if it allows them to work on the product for the foreseeable future then it's fine by me (granted as long as it works as advertised)
---
No post history in fallout subs or here. Plays gacha games.
---
How much is china paying you guys?
---
are you referring to Outer Worlds? or NV? 
---
i agree that 76 had what's got to be in the top ten worst releases of all time, but i still enjoy playing it currently. improvements have been made but some people aren't satisfied with that, and that's cool. different strokes and all that. if the game still cost full price i wouldn't have touched it but as it stands i got a shitload of entertainment out of twenty bucks, and i got to play around the the Fallout universe some more. it's shitty that Bethesda is making these terrible decisions now, but i'm still gonna enjoy the game while i can.
---
protip: if you *really* want to get angry right now, go check out Uncanny Caverns. it is just too perfect for this whole situation.
---
Or they just jump on the drama to farm karma, which is more likely. I saw this godly dude with 230k karma shitting on the game all out of sudden
---
Good. Greedy companies who price gouge and engage in morally, sometimes legally decrepit behavior deserve to get railed over every single media platform.
---
Its a much different comparison.  Minecraft on release had even less "content" than fallout 76, but what made it popular was the freedom players had to do or build whatever they wanted.  There was in total like 4 different types of monsters, one weapon type, etc.
---
Private, dedicated servers are worth the price alone compared to the same service on other games. The atoms are also worth it alone plus the outfit and emotes.
---
G'day! I was just going to lurk and move on, but I saw you said people play it because it's online. Not always true. My husband bought the game because they promised private servers. I still play and love the game because I enjoy the camps, the lack of annoying NPCs (you all say Preston, I raise you Marcie Long)... I've got a level 62 who has finished none of the big quests. I just like the game for the sake of the game.
---
Well, I‚Äôm upvoting because I don‚Äôt think anything you said is unreasonable.
---
I approve. Being a dad I totally get it. My one is, "Close the door! You are letting the bugs in!"
---
Not a bad idea. I wouldn't mind so much if they were at least constructive or a conversation starter. not just whining about deleting the game.
---
I'm not saying they're nerfed - I'm saying that my shotgun is permanently damage bugged. Every time I hit even a low level enemy, they go to 1 health and then regenerate to 80% or so. That's with all possible damage perks too. The shotgun does plenty of damage for my purposes and I would have a ton of fun with it if not for the bug.
---
Bacon of positivity
---
&gt; You think a company should care about anyone who openly admits that their wallets are closed? You do get Bethesda is a for profit company right??
---
&gt;-Please start up a business, buy land, buildings, and equipment. Then hire people, have advertising costs, R&amp;D costs, health care costs. And then tell me how much you plan to focus on people who aren't paying you money.
---
that example doesn't stand when you look at the real world and he's right. 
---
the thing is: we're not talking about people who aren't paying you money, we're talking about past customers who became unhappy with the quality of the products/services and aren't interested in spending more money. 
---
and truth is, keeping your customer base happy is cheaper and more profitable in a long term view than aquiring new customers. which is why this whole thing is indeed bad. they may get a slightly bigger revenue out of dead code, but they get it at the cost of a huge part of their fanbase.
---
Make sure to delete your account and post a picture about it where its at the do you want to continue page. And not actually do it and quietly slink back.
---
I have lost so many legendary items because of this
---
They‚Äôd probably get more cash flow if they reduced the absolutely fuck-you prices in the atom shop.  I‚Äôd be happy to contribute some money in micro transactions, but the item shop isn‚Äôt micro in the least.  Consider that a single power armor skin costs as much as DLC packs generally cost, and I‚Äôm not giving them a dime.  Would I drop $5 on a pack of skins?  Sure.  Would I spend $10 or so on something like a ‚ÄúVault Furniture pack‚Äù that had a lot of furniture based on a theme?  Sure.  
---
But I won‚Äôt support price gouging and whale hunting.  I could buy Fallout 4 on steam with every DLC pack for the price of a single T-51 paint job and a lamp.  If they dropped prices to -actual- micro transaction levels, they‚Äôd probably get a lot more people willing to throw a few bucks in and a lot less giving them the finger.
---
Sorry yep. Completely understood. This person is right stop downvoting the poor bastard.
---
I unsubbed as well, around that time.  It's really just a New Vegas circle jerk.
---
Ah, damn...PS4
---
According to the data you want more of the same. Gotcha.
---
&gt;needs some more patches&lt;
---
As someone who played the game for well over 8 hours, It needs a whole fucking rework
---
yeah, i mean call me crazy for thinking "all future content will be free" means that everything available.. would be free. lol
---
I think it's a decent game.  My line was lack of end game.  I am not a builder and I work too many RL hours to spend seeking enough plans to make a camp NOT look like chip and Joanne gaines had a very very very off day.  My luck is also shit so grinding legendaries or hoping that up right son of a mole rat gives me something good is too much to ask for..
---
It's still fun...if they add more content I might come back and I might do private server but I got into this particular game because it was an MMO...well sort of...I mean it was not just me running around alone
---
It shouldn't befuddle you.  Whenever controversy strikes Bethesda goes silent for awhile until their next sunshine and rainbow inside the vault post comes out.  I would guess we don't see much for publicity on their part until next Thursday.
---
This. I want to know if I'm not playing correctly. Everyone is saying pay to win, but I've never spent a dime. Everyone says they've got to grind to get decent gear, but I do fine with what I have.
---
I mean, I don't really PVP. Is that what everyone wants? I do events and quests, never have any problem.
---
Would I like to do private server? Maybe sometimes, but I don't need it. Nobody does.
---
I usually grow tatos, mutfruit, and corn. I make the adhesive and sell each for 5 caps each at my store. Makes for 10 caps vs 4 caps of food
---
Yeah the game sucks none of my friends wanna play with me because it‚Äôs buggy and all that launch issues  but I enjoy it I just haven‚Äôt played in two months and now there‚Äôs a membership I‚Äôve always enjoyed Bethesda‚Äôs work, but I feel that the community should get this membership for free
---
There is hate and then there is criticism.
---
~~Admins, please delete opinions that I don't like.~~

Then y dont u post something positive instead of complaining, everyone has right to express their feelings. Instead of being better person and do something positive u r here trashing on other people's feelings, and if u can't stomach negative feedback/reviews then u r nt living in reality. If u really wanna help this subreddit STOP crying and post something positive nobody is stopping you.
---
Damn do I hate that! Totally agree, close the damn door behind you. It may be the apocalypse but we can still be at least a bit civil.
---
It's a working debate only if it works in your favor. I get it. Enough whining
---
&gt; -The tent is at best a convenient fast travel point for free. You can put stuff in your stash but you cant scrap anything. You dont have access to your scrapbox. 
---
There is a scrap box in the tent - along with a regular stash box.
---
Post is at 76% upvoted as i write this.
---
Irony aside, that‚Äôs far too low. The ultimate blame lies with Bethesda and Zenimax.
---
But fanbois... you LET them do it.
---
3 atoms.....take it or leave it.
---
Games Bethesda publishes but other studios develop are good, for example Doom, Wolfenstien, EvilWithin, ESO. Bethesda‚Äôs development has gone down hill each title they produce. I guarantee whatever Bethesda game you are thinking of, wasn‚Äôt developed by them.
---
If people ACTUALLY stopped buying anything published by Bethesda, it tells them that their brand needs fixing.
---
NV was fantastic and Outer Worlds I‚Äôve queued up.  I respect your POV there, it‚Äôs a shame the company decided to dump on their goodwill for the sake of greed.
---
Stupid bastards. Bethesda has been looking at modding since at least Skyrim and been annoyed that people are having fun in their game and not paying them. Back when they went through the first iteration of paid modding they did some interviews in more business focused publications about it and talked about how their games have these long lives but they aren‚Äôt getting revenue for it and they wanted to change that. Since then we‚Äôve gotten another iteration of paid modding which I suspect didn‚Äôt go as gangbusters as they hoped so now they‚Äôll try locking modding behind a paywall.
---
Again, Bethesda does not see the modding community as an asset or a partner. Bethesda sees the modding scene as scabs who let people have fun with their products without paying them for the privilege.
---
i just described what the game is, and what a lot of folks buy. it's the latest installment in a popular franchise that i know and like, and want to see more of. and i got to do that for a 20. i could spend the same money (or more) to play an unfinished pre-alpha that is never going to make it to full release.
---
Probably.
---
I'm still having fun, and the things I'm having fun with are not behind a paywall.  Once the actual fun is behind a paywall, then the line is crossed. 
---
I enjoy the private servers for my own reasons, but they aren't a requirement.  
---
Most of the things people call out as P2W are complete garbage.  The fridge? It's only a 50% reduction so the food still eventually spoil, and it's not really any better than the fridge backpack which allows me to have the food on me where I need it. The scrapbot?  Marginally useful - it's not any better than just having a junk node at a camp.  I think it's more interesting for the things it says and it's actual presence than what it does.
---
I find more value of the free things we've actually gotten - the backpack, Bev E Ridge and his quest line, than any of the atom shop items. 
---
I think the tent should be a questline added to the scouts, obviously a little different than whats with the 1st since it doesn't need the scrapbox in it.  
---
I think the scrapbox could be something given to all players.
---
But for me, the line is when the actual "FUN" or real advantage (as much as you can get in what I play as entirely a PvE game) is behind a paywall.
---
LOL! Is this real? Do we still have people defending this game/company? So many questions! Are you Todd himself?
---
This game is already a hit, a hit in the back of our head where they proceed to drop our pants and fuck us in a brutal way. This game isn't just a scam, its a sexual crime.
---
I didn't say what they did is the same as slaughtering kids, so you either again, can't read, or just don't understand what I was saying. It's fine if you don't understand, but thinking that your lack of understanding makes it rambling is toddler logic, friend. Just ask me to explain it further if you don't get it.
---
 It was about "The Dark side" which greed is a part of, how Anakin's greed was for his lover, and he was willing to do bad things like killing kids, and justifies it to himself because of the darkness within him. Bethesda's greed is for money and they're willing to sell you literal cr*p nothing for ludicrous amounts of money, basically stealing from you, like you agreed with, and they justify it to themselves. Do you understand now?
---
Just so you know- the private servers aren't super private. Anyone on your friends list can just join whenever they want and you don't even have the ability to kick them. I subbed because for me the atoms were a good deal as well as features I wanted. However, I probably wouldn't have if I had known I have zero control over who is joining my private world.
---
You won't see a penny in small claims. In small claims, it's basically up to you to get the money from the person you took to court.
---
so you agree that a cheap game is worth a try?
---
It‚Äôs on mine. Go in there with your excavator armor and have a good time
---
Fallout 4 is a watered down fallout. Outer worlds feels more in line with fallout 1 than anything Bethesda has made
---
A couple of more issues (PC, Public, Adventure, no 1st membership)
---
* I'm not sure, were the (0, 0) event indicators supposed to be fixed? [https://youtu.be/8HdNHBklESE](https://youtu.be/8HdNHBklESE) Also the inconvenience that the event was complete before I even could do anything because the turrets killed the horde.
---
* At Dyer Chemical, a Protectron was in the floor in one of the otherwise slightly elevated buildings (sorry, no pic, the moment I realized this it despawned/trashed up below the floor due to my splash damage.)
---
* The free steel via craft-scrap loop is still there. Now it is much safer to do in Private it because the better server stability and less lag. Slap on a keyboard macro and have 300 free steel per minute. No video, obviously.
---
No, it's a working debate if both sides use logic. But you've yet to use any. I'm still waiting haha, but I guess you don't have any logic to give sadly.
---
If they charged for wastlanders I would probably feel the way you do now.  That is always how I took those original statements. Downloadable CONTENT will always be free. As in DLC. Like wastlanders.
---
They also said ony cosmetic items would be behind a paywall.
---
Its a well deserved punishment for the people that sticked with playing this garbage. You brought it to yourselves.
---
just like real life. bethesda once again hitting us right in the feels.
---
may not even happen to you just saying seeing more and more people have it happen to them along with some other weird things such as some areas being cleared out already or items that have a 100% chance of spawning not being there despite there being only one person on the private world
---
I think in this case, it could be false advertising as it directly goes against the trailer ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è but I could be wrong
---
Just didn't know if you had any experience with this whatsoever or if this was just another blind emotionally driven post with no real substance.
---
The purchase is a contract, yes, but by playing this game you agreed that they can change anything. So when you purchase you also agreed the thing you bought could be changed, as it is the part of the game.
---
Bethesda said its to do with a ui problem that doesn't display the junk, apparently its still there but not visible and they're working on it
---
I was planning on buying fallout 1st so I could play  and farm on my own server, However since all this  outrage came out I don't need to because I keep getting put into empty severs anyway so I'm happily farming anyway. Also I been playing solo the whole time the game has been out so I really don't care if others are on. I have done the raid solo on normal difficulty a few times and I have not done the queen for a lil while already own everything she drops. I'm in true endgame now, it's all about camp building.
---
Keep your head deep in the sand, son.
---
Did you think maybe they‚Äôre trying to prevent bottomless farming?
---
you know what i meant.
---
If he never played the game he is already smarter than all of us in here.
---
\&gt; it's just a crappy hate fest.
---
Indeed it is, a justifiable one.
---
The wastelanders downloadable CONTENT or DLC, will be free. Just as advertised. If you read more into it, that's on you.
---
I think this much vocal outcry across all forms of media and all platforms should let them know it‚Äôs a horrible idea.   Blizzard took a long time to respond and their reply was not good.  What will Bethesda do?
---
*Firefly* was good though.
---
nice job refuting what I said member of aforementioned group
---
Everyone's still behind the angry curtain so doubt you get any honest answers but your absolutely right.
---
...do you want a prize or something?
---
All I‚Äôm seeing is hate rants... many don‚Äôt even play the game and admit they‚Äôve uninstalled it... yet they‚Äôre here trashing the game and players many times if they think differently...
---
i can see it being a possibility would make sense to limit things
---
Well, i dont have that armor. And I deleted the game. Pretty sure this is just the beginning of their greed. Wont be around for that.
---
This really is an issue with software. Look at Activision and the way they delay turning on the monetization of their games until after the review window has passed and most people have bought the game. This isn‚Äôt an issue with a physical product. A car dealer can‚Äôt come to your house in the middle of the night, take the wheels off the car you bought a month ago and replace them with donuts and then offer to rent you back the wheels for an extra $59.99 a month. Yet, that‚Äôs exactly what a software company can.
---
^^This. Even in regular servers, if someone else picked a location clean and you arrive AFTER they left, the location will reset based on your loot table. It could still be picked clean, but only if you recently picked it clean.
---

---
A better comparison is reading about rape is not the same thing as experiencing it first hand! Thats what happened to the people that bought this game.
---
But....but....
---
You can play it completely solo on public servers.  It's not going to cost you $12.99 per moth or $99.99 per year do to that.  You'll run into other players at times, but you aren't required to interact with them.
---
Just.. turn pacifist on, and don't hang out in workshops.
---
Here's the big problem: in past games, the modding community would step up and fix all the shit that Bethesda was too lazy and/or incompetent to fix. That's not possible with F76.
---
Yeah Bethesda says stuff alot doesn't mean it's true. I cant craft or repair anything so I think my stuff is rlly gone.
---
Placate the wife.
---
Now I'm sad.
---
Exactly. I work hard to keep my little shop stocked with cool and useful cheap stuff for people. I am now going to get well and truly steamrollered by all the private server vendors who now have exclusive access to every junk spawn and enemy. This is not a positive change. It's divisive. Pay up or miss out. I liked it when we were all in it together on a level playing field.
---
&gt;WTF is the point of even having them on the store?
---
Money. Money is the point. For every player that will fight to earn it legit there's another who will buy it to save the hassle
---
Sunk cost fallacy is a bitch, huh.
---
Exactly this! Many purposely joined with no history whatsoever and post hate about the game.
---
I'm all for this. Sound the horn!!
---
&gt; I keep getting put into empty severs anyway
---
They recently mentioned that the only containers you already find looted are those that you have already looted in a Public World. Meaning, it behaves exactly like it did before, you cannot server jump (Public or not) and loot the same container twice.
---

I still go back and replay Fallout 3 (my favorite game of all time) and Fallout 4 occasionally so I'll probably be playing Fallout 76 off and on for as long as it's around.  I won't be playing it every day, but I'll revisit it from time to time.
---
I'm not sure what'll make me put it down for a while.  I would've said that playing through Wastelanders would be the last thing before I move on to another game, but with that being delayed, I'm not sure I'll make it that long.  I need new quests.  New places to explore too.  I would LOVE it if they kept the map to WV, but 'stretched' it so they fit in more of the places that are missing, and eventually encompassing practically the whole state.
---
But that's a pipe dream.  In reality I'll probably stop playing sometime next year and move on to something else.
---
You should take your own advice
---
Well if you're such a big boi why don't you provide me with the proof first then?
---
I pretty much said the same thing in a comment t two hours ago in another post... people are still commenting and trashing me. Literally just said I was tired of all the whining.  Now I'm a moron, whale, idiot, I'm too stupid to understand,  etc, etc., etc....
---
&gt;the future of FO76
---
what future are you talking about ?
---
Yep..just happened to me..an instigating..nope fuck it it's gone. 
---
Usually 4 out of 10 crickets drop through the floor
---
We can't stop whales paying to win. We can refuse to but products fr9m companies that exploit this shit.
---
I won't buy TES7 until I see it on steam for ¬£2
---
Then refer back to what I said about it being a small convenience
---
Bought it last night along with Vampyre. Not sure which one to play!
---
Maybe I'll see the light. I used to be really into for honor. A buggy mess and barely playable. But I wanted to believe it could be good because I got it free with my graphics card. But after I could never play even one moment of it because the devs couldn't care to even keep the servers up... I saw the light. And I finally left, dropping the player base back to 5 people. There's hope for me yet.
---
‚ÄúScrewed over‚Äù dude, this is a video game we‚Äôre talking about. My rights and freedoms are not being infringed. Bethesda is a private company.  They can do as they please. Charge whatever prices they want. I believe that everything they‚Äôre doing is fair and reasonable. I don‚Äôt agree with your negative perspective and what you‚Äôre demanding of a company you don‚Äôt own or operate. If Bethesda moves their prices to a point that I am not comfortable with paying, then I won‚Äôt pay it anymore. 
---
I paid $60 for breathe of the wild and I played it for around 100 hours. I feel that this was well worth the price. 
---
I paid $60 for FO76 and I have played it for ....fuck, I don‚Äôt even want to know. Probably over 1000 hours. The infinite gaming experience that FO76 provides is more similar to Netflix than to a finite game. A month subscription just makes sense in our market. When I get tired of FO76, I can cancel my subscription. Or, do you hate on Netflix for charging a monthly fee too??
---
I think a slightly better (and an idea that I think might get less backlash from potential P2W)
---
* Add a quest line to the vault-tec agricultural center that allows the player to take over one of the robots (a mr. Handy)
---
* Add skins for the different factions (and just some silly stuff) on the atom shop.
---
Everyone gets access to the farm bot, money can be made from people who buy skins for it.
---
I was heavily involved with the trading community in FO76, so I ended up accumulating around 200 "friends" on my social list.  In the last few days, I've seen more people playing than I have in months.
---
Well you're not there posting about that game, are you?
---
I am saying, even in NV the NCR one had less details than the other ones, were they trying to do a replica, it is of course the one we have, which mostly resembles the NCR one, will have less details.
---
As for CPD / LVPD, of course it is different, you are not in LV are you?
---
The helmet and stuff is a little off but it's obvious there are going for the NCR version.
---
Or just buy the games without the micropayments and not the ones that do. Same message without missing out on good games.
---
thats disingenuous garbage, you dont even know why all the monetization is occuring, look up Providence Equity and Zenimax's relationship, its a money grab and you arent "supporting" anything, you are subsidizing Providence Equity's greed and the massive losses Bethesda/Zenimax took due to the poor launch, ignorance appears to be your main driving force in life, sad
---
Oh so I have to have it installed in order to criticize it? Where's the logic behind that?
---
I can't criticize China's persecution of the Uighur minorities because I don't live there?
---
I can't condemn a rapists actions because I don't know him?
---
/r/gatekeeping
---
Admins should do something... the feed is literally full of hate... it‚Äôs a joke.
---
Dude, I'm seeing your post as removed. Was it you? I hope it was you, or I will be sad. As for an argument, you just name the time and place!
---
They have proven they can say one thing and do another so anything is possible now. If enough people pay for this sub then it will prob happen.
---
It's in the name! *Scrap* box! It *scraps* all your progress so you get to enjoy the game even more!
---
My favorite movie is the Revenge of the Sith. Also liked parts of the other prequel movies and the same aply to the original trilogy, they had good parts and awful parts. I guess the only one that was good during the whole time is The Empire Strikes Back.
---
Hey people r angry I get it. Just be angry somewhere else
---
I payed 60$ for the game and I have a lvl 60 character. You clearly have no fucking idea of what you're talking about.
---
Ya most people don't understand how the corporate world works. This is no different then the gaming overlords EA, Activision, Ubisoft , Etc. ZeniMax is just as bad, but most people know Bethesda for Bethesda so they put all the blame on them. At the end of the day Zenimax still has control and only cares about the numbers and the investor which is why games have been absolute shit in the past years. RIP Bethesda and all the other once great Developers due to corporate greed.
---
 And can we stop blaming Todd he's literally at the bottem of the corporate food chain and has no choice but to say yes or be removed.
---
But damn to they suck at monetization, your supposed to slowly rip off the customer not try to force your way in like a raider and loot the dead body. Sad day, i wonder how they going to try to monetize Starfield.
---
like the idea, but only benefits those with one shot kill weapons.
---
I think I understand why there is a portion of the userbase that actually welcomes this crap.
---
Mold in the power helmet causing delusions. It's the only explanation.
---
I genuinely felt like the Nuclear Winter/Free week update where the turning points for this game. Saw so much positivity and new players evening hooked and the NPCs returning gave me hope for a more traditional Fallout RPG but then they get even more greedy with the stupid fridge and now here we are. This could have been a great game in a bother year or so now everyone hates its reputation even more so this game is as good as dead. Not much longer before the server funding runs out.
---
lol this won't happen, to a lot of people this would be diminishing good will further
---
People are allowed to complain, I'm sorry your echo chamber is falling apart.
---
I‚Äôd agree to this however many are new accounts with no other comments other than hating on Bethesda.
---
I didn't disagree with you.  I just wanted to help clarify one of your points.  I have the subscription as well.
---
That what I liked about this game when I played it. The game wasnt that good because of Bethesda but the community was amazing. Whereas with a game like the division 2 having good developers who listen, have a some pretty toxic people in the community. I never got kicked out of a group or anything like that in Fallout 76, but the happens very often in the division. 
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is that this game could be great if the developers worked with the great community that they have.
---
Here‚Äôs a question, if I buy a first class ticket on an airplane, and you buy an economy ticket, is it unfair? 
---
We‚Äôre both getting to the same destination, both using the same plane, the only thing that changes is level of service, is that wrong?
---
Mhh.. they sure do get more money out of you with monthly subscriptions rather than a single buy DLC, though...
---
Oh god, I hope they hold out longer than that... Fingers crossed!!
---
I have an issue with the additional benefits and I am a subscriber. The server was all I wanted, the atoms were icing on the cake. 
---
The junk stash, the ranger outfit and the second camp should not be included with no other option to obtain them. 
---
Either a second tier of subscription should be created which includes those items only, or they should just be relegated to the atomic shop. 
---
Or if we want to get really crazy and probably unrealistic, just fucking give them to everybody.
---
We looked at the Data...
---
Exactly. People just overreact sometimes. And there's a lot of new people on this subreddit since the announcement. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of them don't even play the game and just want the free karma.
---
YES!!!!!!!
---
Rd2 is looking much better though üôÇ
---
$60 on what?
---
That's not too surprising since sarcasm is primarily conveyed by tone of voice, which text doesn't have.
---
Wrong... you may have the right to but the admins don‚Äôt have to give you or any other person the right... that‚Äôs a fact!
---
I agree. And just because I'm exhausted hearing all the complaints doesn't make me a moron and deservi of personal attacks lol. And they wonder why people would spend money to play on a private server. Lol
---
You're so upset, that you made a second reddit account to make it seem like 2 different people felt the same way?
---
The game is buggy, sure. Every Bethesda game ever has been buggy. That's the nature of the Creation Engine. It's literally NEVER been a flawless engine. Then again, nothing else gives the same open world experience that it does either.
---
They didn't ruin anything. They are trying to save the game before it's too late, and to do that they need money. They're a private company. They aren't controlled by shareholders. This gives them  freedom few other game companies have. If all of the "loyal fans" had actual BOUGHT Atoms instead of just farming them in game, we probably wouldn't have seen a subscription. Did no one see the lack of weekly patches and service updates and think "Wow. This game doesn't have the funding it needs to be successful. I should support this game I love so much by buying atoms once a month." No. No one did. You all just bitched anytime something you wanted MIGHT cost you money. It's absolutely ridiculous, and the game is in the state it's in because of the selfish, entitled mindset that plagues a good chunk of the player base.
---
Dude, seriously? What's wrong with you?
---
If you are saying they should release the Riot gear ones for Fallout 1st, then I think you are very wrong, people are mostly asking for the classic one that resembles the NCR one.
---
Respectfully disagree, Fallout 1st is indeed bad,  it might be more acceptable if it was in fact a dedicated server that people are paying for.  But this is constant spam for no purpose other than to drum up hate,  it's no longer justifiable by trying to see a change for the better because no one ever offers one.  It's constantly "Sell the IP to Obsidian." or something else just as unhelpful.
---
Yep.. they are everywhere.  Censorship is a slippery slope, though.  As much as I detest the deliberate 4chan brigading of the sub, I understand why the moderators are letting it be for now.
---
No the point is, if you hate the game then I assume it‚Äôs uninstalled. If it‚Äôs uninstalled, why are you even posting here?  Aren‚Äôt you enjoying another game?  
---
I just don‚Äôt understand why people who hate this game are posting here and trying to convince those of us that are playing the game game that we are stupid and wrong. 
---
We get it.  People are angry. We get that many dislike the game.  
---
Some of us still enjoy it.
---
Fuck this game
---
Ever hear the statistical representation and random sampling? Any case, how big is the actual player base? I've been reading is best guesses and potentially "1 million copies" sold, but that could just be marketing.
---
Don‚Äôt kid yourself, this has been going on for a long time. Remember horse armor? It‚Äôs a meme now but they were one of the first companies to start pushing that kind of DLC. They tried to push paid modding not once but twice. They intentionally delayed releasing Fallout 4‚Äôs GECK for six months to push out workshop DLC that would have been made in mods with the right tools. FO76 and all it‚Äôs bullshit is just following the same trajectory Bethesda‚Äôs been on for over a decade. Anyone still excited for Starfield and TES6 is just kidding themselves at this point.
---
The OP has a very different definition of positivity then the rest of the world does...
---
&gt;This has exceeded my wildest expectation on how far they would go.
---
Why? They tried to put mods behind a paywall about 5 years ago and everyone pretends like this never happened. Bethesda and Valve teamed up to charge money for mods and then backed off almost immediately when players and modders protested. But it's obvious that the idea was never abandoned. The existence of the "Creators Club" is proof of that. 
---
Bethesda realizes that the number one selling point of their games is the fact that thy're popular with modders. Heck, this is the reason they're one of the only publishers that have integrated modding into the console version of their games. But they also realized that they can probably parlay this fact into some extra revenue. Revenue that they can generate with zero effort. It's a win-win situation. So of course they're going to put mods for Fallout 76 behind a paywall. And they have a built in defense as to why they're doing it: game play balance.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if their next single player release will lock modding itself behind some sort of paywall. Like if you want access to the games modding tools you have to sign up and become a member of The Creators Club and distribute your mods exclusively through that service. 
---
At this point nothing Bethesda does surprises or shocks me. And I'm certain that eventually they're going to lock down mods in a way that players won't be able to use them without kicking some pennies to Bethesda for each one they use. And I wouldn't be surprised if other publishers and developers do the same thing. It's money on the table.
---
But everyone gets to play. Everything. Even if they cant pay more. That right there is better than almost any other game.
---
That's the one! Thank you good sir or madam!
---
*as a questline reward
---
&gt;Not stunning enough to warrant THOUSANDS of dollars price tag on some of their ships.
---
Wait... what? and " People literally buy insurance for ships that both dont exist and most likely never will, not even digitally... " WHAT!? lol can you explain this to me?
---
You said you did.
---
&gt;I believe I should be compensated for this either some atoms or an extension on the service
---
The reason there is not another sub limited to complaints about Bethesda/Fallout 76, (and the reason people will not use such a thread  en masse), inherently resides in a need for attention.  When people repeatedly complain about the same thing for different reasons or in new ways, it is because they feel they ‚Äúknow‚Äù something you don‚Äôt.  Misery loves company, but what‚Äôs on display is not just misery, it‚Äôs an insecurity (certainly not in all cases, I don‚Äôt want to paint any group completely with one stroke), but in most cases.  If you truly dislike something you just want it out of your life.  It is easy enough to delete the game and not come on this sub if that is the case.  So requesting that people leave, while admirable, is likely an exercise in futility.
---
Yep same here. It's actually kinda interesting there's a huge pushback online but the people playing are actually playing. Public events have been AMAZINGLY quick
---
youre deflecting because you cannot refute the real issue which is the ratio of content to monetization is unbalanced, in favor of monetization, stop speaking on things you know nothing about, look up providence equity and zenimax and then get back to me and tell me this is anything other than a money grab before providence bails and zenimax gets out of the video game industry
---
Yea, you got me there, lol. 
---
I didn‚Äôt actually realize that. TIL.
---
Lvl 60 takes like no time to get to. That's like if you played maybe 20 hours total. Don't try and flex lol, that's literally a level I got to during beta.
---
Oh look. You watched a Juicehead video. 
---
Solid regurgitating there.
---
It doesn't matter WHY it's happening. It doesn't limit my ability to play the core 76 experience, if I opt in to any of their monetization or not.
---
I had been telling my husband how excited I was to go back to this game. But after the BS with blizzard and china, he stopped supporting WoW to stand up for what he believes in.  So In solidarity i'm doing the same with Fallout 76 until Bethesda unfucks itself.
---
No they know. They want it to be whatever you shmucks are willing to pay for with minimal effort on their part. How has that not been obvious this whole time?
---
I didn‚Äôt say you did.
---
totally agree. It gives an advantage to those who are willing/able to pay a monthly fee.
---
Rights and freedom of speech arguments are weak... sorry but you can‚Äôt just say anything you want in a group, it‚Äôs up to the admins and they can delete and block that so called ‚Äúright‚Äù of yours in a click... 
---
Create a subreddit of hate... mist enjoy the game and sick and tired of people that have uninstalled the game or not playing it commenting with zero history in there profiles.
---
They should send free lube for the wallet fucking the buyers are gonna get
---
I know but fun though
---
I've heard it's no better or worse than the previous games.
---
 basically if you're already a fan you'll like it.
---
Haven't played it myself though.
---
I'd play the shit out of this!!! Good idea!
---
Yeah, that's why games have a price tag. There's already games that allow local private servers for free. Why is FO76 an exception? They want you online all the time so they can monetize you out the ass.
---
In reference it takes to fix the issue. I refuse to go pn public servers cause that seems to be causing the issue. So I am technically impacted without losing my stuff in fear of losing my stuff.
---
&gt; I'd really love to be outraged (don't you just love to be outraged?),
---
Oh, I'm outraged all right.  I'm outraged by all the people who are outraged.  I'm also pretty sure that very few of them are FO76 players.
---
I agree.  Arktos Pharma actually drew a crowd TWICE last night.  I haven't seen a soul at that event in a very long time.
---
Oh yeah? I didn't know. Although if they're re-using the server world (as seems to be the case), I wonder if it's just super lucky to land in the same server?
---
I do believe the proper term for this subreddit is a ‚Äòtoxic shithole‚Äô - almost as bad as r/fallout.
---
This isn't a fucking serious debate. "Intellectually honest" you sound like some moron that spends all their time arguing about politics and screaming about Donald Trump.
---
Actual moron
---
That attitude is what caused MTXs to be so prevalent in the first place.
---
He has a lot of bits in his act about loving bacon.... what's not to get?
---
They are not micro dlcs, they are microtransactions and there is no fucking need to release those on a single-player game other than wanting to making profit with it. Heaven forbid Bethesda for being a bunch of greedy bastards.
---
I'm not poor, just not wanting to unfairly pay to ease the mildly funcioning gameplay. In the other hand you're obviously an spoiled Bethesda fanboy who will eat their shit no matter how much money it costs. I know which of both options is worse.
---
i bought 76 for $20 after i heard a few different perspectives on it. mainly about how yes, it sucked on launch, but it was also the first fallout game to receive regular patches and that said patches had improved the game quite a bit. i'm also a fan of the franchise. so, for me, the game is currently working fine, very enjoyable and now comes with pay-to-win.
---
why are *you* here?
---
Good luck with that. I would‚Äôve done the same but I am located in EU.
---
This happened exactly because people like you suported the circus that FO76 was. The speech you spew right now, is what other real fans of the game said at the beggining. People that have been playing FO and other Bethesda games despite all glitches. I own Skyrim and Oblivion on every system. Let's not talk about other Bethesda games. Bethesda is one of the companies that I used to look up for. I even wanted to work for them.
---
What pisses me off about your post is that it feels in your first paragraph as if those who jumped ship at the beggining are not "POSITIVE ENOUGH". Don't you come crying now man. They turned on you as well. Ever since I started realizing that Bethesda was making stupid decisions business wise I cancelled my pre-order of FO76.
---
They turned on their fandom a long time ago. Those that jumped ship are not the negative ones. Those are the smart people that decided to give their money and time on better companies like CDPR or Larian.
---
People can have an opinion right? Mine is too many butthurt people whining clogging up the feed spreading hate... it‚Äôs ruining the subreddit in a big way.
---
Ah yes and storing thousands/tens of thousands of entries for each player is surely comparable to storing data for one player on a local file.
---
I noticed the same. People I haven‚Äôt seen on in months are all the sudden back on it.
---
Probably at home under the bedsheets praying for Blizzard to ban someone again :)
---
So it's in the game itself and people are surprised. ü§î
---
one of the theories for stuff such as items and enemies not being there is that the private world we get isnt fully ours but is actually one shared with a few people so once someone logs out of it someone else will get that world when they login just a theory but its seeming like it more and more
---
The fuck are you defending this shit game?
---
That‚Äôs fine as well.
---
I'd say it feels like a heavily modded New Vegas with better combat.
---
You have it backwards. There's a vocal minority that is angry over the subscription. The rest of us, the majority who understand that things cost money to make, are buying the subscription so that the game we enjoy succeeds. The game has seen activity since the announcement that hasn't been there in months. People LOVE this idea. Eventually you assholes that are bitching will lose interest and move on.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôve built a lot at this point so I can throw them up pretty fast. I started by building at workshops and trying smaller versions of things there :)
---
hmm to be fair i guess i'm paying... $13.60 in freedom units.
---
Proving my point about people who don't know anything brigading the sub
---
Yes exactly my thoughts. I don‚Äôt understand wtf wrong with people. Bethesda is keeping its promises and never lied to us. I‚Äôd pay $100 per day if they asked me. The subscription is the best thing since sliced bread.
---
Except this doesn't really do anything to the company, it just damages the community.  People are literally just spamming crappy posts on the topic solely to stir up hate without any goal of a resolution.
---
The company is deceitful, of questionable morality, but this isn't targeting the company it's targeting the community.  It's a desperate bid by outliers to try and fracture what little community remains here.  There are still people here who are trying to enjoy what they can of the product and we should try to respect that rather than constantly spamming posts in both communities.
---
Seriously, how many people here now are here because they actually play 76?  How many are here from the main subreddit just because of this news?
---
With hard bargain 3 you can get 2 caps for mutfruit and a few other veggies.
---
There is always gonna be those who abuse the system thats wat humans do, but there are also those who love this franchise even if they don't play the game or they have it uninstalled they like to voice their opinions.
---
If there r one individual or many individuals or group of ppl who always do this (refering to those who just spread hate for no reason) then its admins fault for nt monitoring this behavior from the beginning but u can't just flat-out close the door to everyone cause there r few bad apples among them. And there is always few bad apple among every culture, every race, religion family ...... should just close the door to humanity it self?
---
Tell me you understand then. Is it hateful to say that the Scrap Box is one of the biggest QoL improvements the game has seen and should not be behind a paywall?
---
Its indeed a mistery how someone can still defend this "game". And as there are a few they call themselves an order. Simple. Its not truly related to the order of misteries in the game.
---
You're not wrong that it's v suspicious that there's such a pushback from non-players
---
Bethesda is still the property of Zenimax, and still makes corporate decisions that affect Bethesda. This has been the trend of game developers for the past years. Just remember Zenimax is no better than Activision or EA just because thay haven't been in the spotlight. At the end of the day we don't matter, the stockholders do.
---
Yes, it has. I used to believe the game was a shitload of disconnects, lag and latence because the game has problems. I don't do silo runs because of that. Now I know the game works fine if you pay extra. 
---
So yes, it has. Because I am playing Fallout 4, now.
---
Yeah, all noobs say that. *shrug*
---
The fact that you can't see how it 100% affects everybody is pretty sad.
---
COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME COUNSUME CONSUME CONSUME
---
DON'T THINK JUST CONSUME. NVM THAT YOU ALREADY PAID FULL PRICE AND THAT FO76 WAS ADVERTISED TO HAVE NO SEASON PASS AND TAHT ALL UPDATES ARE FREE. ALSO HAIL EA, ACTIVIASION, BETEHSDA AND BLIZZARD.
---
Yes. But really how many people read the fine print.
---
For one you might want to check what the word moral means because it literally has nothing to do with what you are trying to express. Intellectually consistent is what you are looking for. Second, if the game consists of crafting mechanics that serves a greater purpose (ie telling a story) then it‚Äôs completely different. What is ridiculous is logging on to a game just to collect trash to craft random shit in a game that sucks balls
---
And you're trying to stretch the definition of content because you either want to be outraged, and need justification for it, or want it free.
---
Then leave. Just like all the people who used to play are doing. Leaving. And for good reason.
---
So, explain this slippery slope to me.
---
You can buy a subscription if you want to.  If you do you get unlimited space to store scrap, a place to go and hang with your friends and some cool gear.
---
If you don't pay for the subscription you have exactly the same game you had at the start of the week.
---
I'm just not seeing any slope, slippery or otherwise.
---
According to this sub, no you can't. I've been slammed for stating my opinion, so clearly you can only have an opinion if it's in favor of this game. Echo chamber much?
---
Seeing as that game is now nearly a decade old, of course not. I just mock it when talking about shit games. So the fact it was bad enough to still be the laughing stock it is says a lot.
---
I was here since BETA and I can guarantee you it was a very positive subreddit most of the time. It turns negative when beth messes something up for a week or so. Any criticism (or toxicity) of this game was more or less shut down on this sub. Most top posts were "I love this community" or "Look at my cool base". Even now, many critical posts start with "I love this game but". In recent months, as the # of new players greatly diminished and people got over the honeymoon phase of the game, the sub became more vocal and negative towards mess-ups (which is good).
---
I‚Äôm not mad, Bethesda.
---
Just disappointed.
---
this is a perfect take on the whole situation, a good read and thank you for posting it!
---
If society doesn‚Äôt have certain controls it will fail on epic levels from the ground up. 
---
In a subreddit we agree to certain terms and conditions, laws in other words that we have to stick to. 
---
These hateful rants, not just one or two but a continuous feed destroys the community and they leave. 
---
The haters will eventually leave and then what?
---
You're a whiny little baby aren't you, you should leave you toxic waste of a vault dweller, you radroach, absolute molerat
---
‚ÄúIs this really the group of patrons you want to ostracize?‚Äù  Hahahaha üòÇüòÇ
---
And PS Plus. Paywalls for EVERYONE! /S
---
Definitely disappointed with you. That unlimited stash needs to be free. Stacking another hundred bucks on top of the $100 annual PS plus membership just to play is greedy and unfair to all players.
---
People don't pay insurances, they get those from their ship... with no cost added.
---
Sorry you can't support a company unless they spoon feed you free content like the little baby you are. Luckily, dlc, especially creation club dlc, are completely optional, so you don't have to buy it. But you should definitely stop acting like a bitch when people do pay for it. Like I said, value is subjective
---
Maybe they are at home pre-installing Outer Worlds like everyone else :D
---
I can't really understand.
---
I can't understand how a game company want to suicide they're game in that way?
---
How it's possibile? Maybe they don't know that this move will kill they're game? 
---
Remember me of Star Wars Galaxies...
---
Hoping Eve Online is not going to face that death too...
---
So long FO76 . I never played you...but in that state i will never play it.
---
Please developers don't  watch straight in u're wallet waiting for money to come but first considerer the hearts of the players that wanna have fun of u're game and i'm sure they're more important than make moneys from them .
---
It is as good as the Second World War. Thats how good it is.
---
And everyone screams back, "I KNOW. IT WAS ME!"
---
This. Haha
---
Awesome.  Another non-player chiming in.  Any advise on the proper landing a space shuttle on the moon?  Equally valuable information coming from someone who can't answer the question.
---
Would make more sense if even half of these haters actually play the game
---
But 90% of the time my first hit with a melee attack doesn't actually do damage, despite it making all the sound and visuals that it should have.
---
No wats wrong is that u nt trying to do ntg bout. U could have u tried to post something positive or post something like reviews guide or tutorial to show different point of view but instead u choose easy way which is crying so the change can happen.
---
&gt;Is just playing the game being a supporter? 
---
I would argue yes, to an extent - player count is a metric they use to judge content reception. That you're still playing and using it tells them that it's all good.
---
more ignorance on display, a company like Zenimax doesnt get sell off a controlling share of their company to a venture capital firm unless they are financially struggling or trying to get out of the business. its now about 3 years later and Providence came knocking, and Bethesda/Zeni werent bringing in enough, you still under the illusion that your bending over for these corporations is to fund future content, LOL, the monetization is strictly for Zenimax to pay back Providence, YOU ARE SUBSIDIZING THE LOSSES BETHESDA TOOK DUE TO A POOR LAUNCH RESULTING FROM STUPID DECISIONS. Keep lying to yourself though bro, it suits you. As they say a fool and his money are soon parted. Man if you arent the embodiment of that proverb LMAO. Sure I could drop the $100 and not go bankrupt, and maybe you could do, the difference here is, I am not an idiot lol gtfo outta here, youre just desperate to justify letting yourself get bent over and taken advantage of.
---
You sound a bit delusional. Please take a look at the amount of individual complaints because some post have 10k+ people that lost their trust in FO76 and Bethesda on Reddit alone. Add all other social media platforms and the overal consensus wil be the same.
---
I don't know how big the current active playerbase is because Bethesda refuses to release stats but It wil surely take a huge beating compared to Bethesda's desired outcome.
---
PC sorry. That‚Äôs the third time now that I‚Äôve forgotten to include my platform. :(
---
Real talk, nobody in corporate gives a fuck about 99% of your comments on here, on reddit, youtube, ect.   Bottom line they do because people will pay for this shit.  The people who buy the shit  aint the ones complaining.  It is the folks dropping these log attention seeking soliloquies about how much they paid for some shit a year ago.   So who you going to listen to, a few thousand people who aint going to buy shit, or the few thousand suckers that will?
---
You're kidding me right? This Subreddit has never been a beacon of positivity.
---
Can you expand on the throwing out the stash part?  I wasn‚Äôt aware of that issue.  I otherwise largely agree.  I have enjoyed the game for the first time with no griefers or randos just my girlfriend and I.  The first update I want is to lock the server to only the people I invite.
---
This is a valid criticism. Seems like there's too much variance in the way people perceive the scale.
---
Hilarious.  And original.  You're an asset to the community.
---
Nobody cares!! Go to helll!! you private server hosting , fallout 1st Bastard!!
---
Just kidding....good luck with the queen
---
Everyone wants an opinion and demands to be heard... unless you have a different opinion... then the same exact people ridicule and suppress them... go figure...
---
Then, because people complained that the robot was P2W they nerfed the robot, making it collect less scrap.
---
And people complained about that, too.
---
And 90% of the decisions beth made for the future of this game was total garbage. So it‚Äôs fair, I guess...
---
It's alright you got me loading in now. I'd appreciate my IGN not being shared I am playing on an alt account.
---
When Skyrim was at it's peak, a CO worker and I were talking about how you couldn't "break the game" with crazy enchantments like you used to, and I shared some stories of crazy things I came up with in Oblivion and he said Morrowind was even worse, and that he created boots that let him jump halfway across the world map (probably some exaggeration here, I don't know). Although, one time while power jumping he forgot to put this feather fall gear on. Oops. üòÇ
---
I really wanted to see what other crazy things I could make in that system, but never really got day enough to be able to try it out.
---
Also, fuck Vivec. A house of mirrors would be less confusing.
---
You can say that, but then go look at the sub population of RDR2, Division 2, all the games that did have an amazing release.
---
Fallout has a healthier following than all of them, put together.
---
Forbes.
---
Why is it hilarious? I‚Äôm serious, man! I‚Äôm the sheep and Bethesda is my shepherd
---
Good stuff but you gotta pay Todd $99 a year
---
No worries. I‚Äôll launch when a couple more people join. Clear west tek or whitespring if you want, you‚Äôll see how much smoother it is compared to public.
---
When did you delete the game? You are acting like this is a really big deal when it‚Äôs not. If you didn‚Äôt have excavator you clearly didn‚Äôt play very long when you had the game. It‚Äôs a shame to see you go but really people who pay aren‚Äôt at some sort of advantage. You can still have a great experience in adventure mode.
---
There are legendary SBs ???? I have not ran into any.. :(
---
u/gilpo1 and I had worked on this, and the information can be found here for Mischief: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm6iyp/full_list_of_mischief_night_rewards_odds_of/
---
For meat week and Fasnacht, I'd have to get back to you as I am at work right now.
---
Ha.  That made me laugh.  I appreciate your absolute honesty.  Here‚Äôs the paradox:  if you get more enjoyment out of hating on the game than playing it, then it means such a failure, (as you would see the game/company or be), is actually fulfilling.  So in this weird way if you get a lot of enjoyment out of complaining about it then really you have to be a big fan of it‚Äôs existence.
---
Nah I paid 35$ cause I don‚Äôt buy games new like a dub. I make choices on what I want to buy not bitch about them online. Fuck outta here with that bum ass argument.
---
This one sure is.
---
Bethesda actually regularly commented and had positive karma for a lot of it. Everyone who wasn‚Äôt in this little bubble was probably 10x more likely to just shit on the company and the game no matter what.
---
This sub being basically one big middle finger after the subscription announcement means the number of people content with it is so small it‚Äôs not even worth it.
---
After playing in the private world with 7 of my friends and seeing how smooth overall it is when no one is constantly switching worlds, glitching and a list of other things... yeah it was awesome! 
---
I‚Äôm 100% positive Bethesda sees this and will come down and make changes.
---
Being one of these fans, as well as a long time player since f3 I can confirm. This was my absolute last straw. What do I tell all my friends that bought the game under my word? The friends who took months of convincing, me defending this garbage game to give your company the benefit of the doubt.  If i'm being honest it feels like constant slaps in the face almost every time an update for this game comes out,  I have ignored this games atrocities for far FAR to long but everyone has a breaking point. Whats even worse is i've lost the motivation to report bugs or tell you why you shouldn't treat your fan base this way. You have lost an over-loyal lone wanderer Bethesda. Farewell.
---
Although I can see how that could suck for some, it's not much of an issue for me. I play with a tight group of friends and dont have randoms ever join.
---
Totally agree it would be nice to be able to control who joins. Let's hope that's in an upcoming patch!
---
Ah, the classy "supporting a company" thing. Yes, you already do support a company by just buying the damn game. If you want to support them go donate them. What they are doing is forcing the buying as much as they can. Is not about getting everything for free (which is what they promised btw), it's about having to pay for the game and then having to pay for 100+ other things on it, while the game itself isn't even finished.
---
Dumb isn't it
---
I'm also a subscriber, I'll leave it for somebody else to experience because it is amazing. 
---
PS: I've done the vault on private as a 2 person group. Smooth like butter.
---
I‚Äôm almost certain survival tent skins &amp; possible customisation will come down the line.
---
Me too! I was like "Hehe outer worldy... good one."
---
Thank you so much!
---
I stopped playing when people started sharing their stories of doing silo runs and other things with ni lag, no latence, no problems. Jumped into a friend's private session to check it myself and everything worked fine. Even my shotguns started doing real damage, no rubberband, no health regeneration. Melee hit detection was better too.
---
I didnt pay enough money at release, apparently, to own the 'working' version of the game. 
---
So now, I play Fallout 4. Bethesda deserves to be sued because this shit Is borderline criminal and certainly illegal.
---
The negative feedback in a fan sub \*IS\* important - If the producers have the minimum of brain that check the fan subs from time to time.
---
It only affects people who pay, if you don‚Äôt want to pay, (listen to me carefully here) YOU DON‚ÄôT HAVE TO PAY! 
---
These kinds of threads are just sour grapes, and for karma farmers to get easy  likes jumping on the hate Bethesda bandwagon.
---
Except that you get more value for your money on other games ;/
---
I know right? What is this guy smoking lol?
---
You've lost nothing then?
---
You've suffered no actual loss and haven't been impacted. 
---
However there is a way to see if you should be worried.
---
It's just junk I suggest emptying your scrap box onto your character. Leave some useless junk in it. Head to a public server and see if you lose your junk. 
---
The junk on your character will be safe. It's an easy test to see if you're affected by this bug as it seems many players have no issue. You can do this test without losing anything of importance.
---
Aye it‚Äôs so much better. On public most of the time spent in the vault or in the silos is waiting for things to pick up or register.
---
I've always said to my friends MMO's are in a fragile state, they require a monthly sub because they require constant work for constant content.
---
When I saw the sub to FO76, the first thought i had was, wheres the content ? 
---
Like OP says, I log on, run afew times through westek and log off, nothing new nothing excited.
---
you are wrong
---
mtx is prevalent because the market wanted it
---
People following a sub doesn't equal people playing a game. I stopped playing FO76 weeks ago, and before that I used to take very long breaks due to lack of content. But I'm still subbed. 
---
If you want to really see how many people play, check the player counts. They are not looking good.
---
Serious question without any bad intentions: what convinced you to buy that subscription? I mean it is a lot of money.
---
Tent skin I guess would be okay, but I would definitely love to be able to put in work benches of some type.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. The only issue I see is the unlimited scrap. I couldn't care less about the rest.
---
One less turd in the punch bowl
---
&gt; Well they had one for the canvas bags 
---
Except they didn't.  They had some shysters making press releases hoping to get some money.
---
It‚Äôs also a business and they‚Äôll not only support the community that pays them but give them what they want plus more so they can continue to get paid... create new content, and more. It‚Äôs a business. 
---
If a business gave things away for free, how do we expect new content? 
---
Much like real life NOTHING is free... people need to get over that.
---
A beacon of positivity? For fuck sake this place is a total shit show of doom and gloom and slippery slopes every fucking time something like this happens. Repair kits were p2w and would ruin the game, the fridge was p2w and would ruin the game. If you think that people losing their shit like this is new then you've been living in a fantasy world.
---
Username checks out.
---
The dumpster fire you refer to is getting more viewership than any of the other open world or looter/shooter games that released in around that time. 
---
The only thing Bethesda wants/needs is to keep people talking about their game. For every person who hasn't bought it yet, the out cry just keeps it relevant.
---
Besides, they already have all the angry players money. They don't care what we think.
---
it litteraly does. the fuck are you talking about lmao.
---
Happy cake day!!
---
I think right now the real issue with FO76 is the lack of content.   Bethesda pushed out all kinds of new stuff that was half baked. Survival, NW battle royale, vault raids and even the main game. Now the paid service where you can't even get a persistent server that saves your builds. This however doesn't seem to effect the atom shop.
---
People are screaming for content and we get a bunch of half assed additions and bugs.
---
Players wouldn't mind the money grab so much if we were getting a great product in return. Sadly we are not.  This is where the hate is generated.   
---
If Bethesda would buckle down and fix bugs, add more endgame content, and add some small QOL stuff it would mend the fanbase.
---
At the end of the day they continue to be tone deaf and keep cash grabbing.  It's sad because I really enjoy the game in many ways.
---
That‚Äôs cus you idiots gullibly bought their game. It took them making you pay $80, then them also making you pay monthly for you to realize it‚Äôs garbage. Worse is no one would play that game for free
---
No you didn't provide anything. Claiming that you did doesn't mean you actually did.
---
You don‚Äôt need to pay a year. It has monthly service too.
---
All aboard the downvote train choooo choooooo
---
I‚Äôm just kidding but seriously, not worth the post
---
Now go to the 18 million comments and say the same thing... I‚Äôll wait...lol
---
There‚Äôs a lot of space in that tent to easily fit 1 workbench!
---
Well maybe all those people complaining just did the same as i did because the ghouls i killed where still laying there too when i was rejoining the same world to get the ghouls to spawn again
---
Except you don't have to pay that much. But keep lying to yourself. 13 a month, IF you find value in it. Or, 100 a year. I spend 100+ a month just on new games coming out, 100 a year for a subscription service is literally nothing.
---
Wtf, if someone here doesn't know how a company manages its game is clearly you. When a project is being made, resources from every team are put on said project. This project was obviously this subscription and who knows what other cashgrab projects they are working on.
---
no i put up wit all their shit and now iv just given up tbh, i love Bethesda games but at this point you cant defend what there doing it pay to win with a season pass, i paid 8 pound for it and still not worth that its a free to play modle
---
Where have you been bud it‚Äôs been this way since launch
---
Seeing other players camps is part of what little 'new content' this game has for me, so private servers aren't exactly a draw there. I mean it could be neat further down the road if they actually add the workshop persistence, but coulda shoulda woulda isn't a selling point.
---
it depends what way its set up the servers arent public (i dont own 76 so i dont know if randoms can join i make mods so thats why im on this forum and want to know what way this will work),i think how it will work is if you want to join a server you will need to download all mods for that server the person paying for it choses the mods
---
yeah thats probably correct.  I just think overall one of the main issues with the game in general is sort of a lack of identity.
---
This is technically the only thing to do...its a move similar to boycott, its either bethesda do something about it because of the rant or shit will stay the same and thus is bad for everyone, including those whom don't care about money because the game will have a very low player base and therefore die.
---
It‚Äôs the same thing here. FO76 1st is just like a first class ticket compared to base game coach.
---
that's cool and all but I was talking about Fo76 specifically. and if you really grew cautious about predatory business practices so long ago, then you wouldn't have deemed "the resistance to multiplayer TES/Fallout games by the Bethesda community to be fanatical" in the first place.
---
also 12 years ago I was 20.
---
Sadly a lot of these people were enjoying the game and this subreddit wasn't filled with such endless vitriol a week ago. Wait about 1-2 weeks, in our ADD culture no attention span will last that long. We just need time to vent with other people similarly affected and there is no better place to go. Love it or hate it (good or bad) this is where people come to express their opinions and queries about the game. (feelings can't be argued or reasoned with they just need to run their course)
---
Stopped playing 4 months ago or so. After seeing how average and easy the quests were in wild appalachia and then seeing how uninteresting the scout quests were for me, I stopped. I was already sick of the game at the time anyway. No innovation, care or creativity. Every single thing they released, it takes me 5 seconds to come up with a better way to design it (talking about the dungeon sewer place and quests etc). Nevermind the mutation bugs that made the game almost unplayable for me. It was plainly obvious they were incompetent and didn't care. I remember playing Anthem beta and being surprised by how much better the storytelling felt. This is when I realized I had dropped my standards way too low.
---
show commitment to whom ? you wouldn't see it. be honest, you're just trolling. yesterday, i've cancelled the patch install and  deleted the game. for me that means a lot, i was playing pretty much only this game. 
---
when you quit your wife, do you burn the house down as well to "show your commitment" ?
---
The publisher's greed is allowed and encouraged by the players. Without them buying and playing and defending and spending in 76 none of this would be happening. It's completely justifiable to blame the player base when they enable the publisher.
---
Basically you just confirmed it.
---
Its shitty matchmaking and they charge you for a private game and friend invite only.
---
Well most ppl did pay $60 for this game including me and the game had issues and still has issue so am I really getting anything for free or does $60 sound like pocket change to u ?
---
Why
---
tl;dr - Blame the consumer for the perpetrator's actions.
---
i HAVE noticed not nearly as many players on lat night, it was a huge difference
---
so yeah, id say FO1st DOES affect us all, as so many people are sick of the bullshit they have left the game.
---
It can still send the message that you're willing to buy an unfinished, grindy game. And if you're willing to buy an unfinished or grindy game they have no incentive to finish it and have plenty of reason to introduce microtransactions for those who dislike the grind. You'd still be part of the problem (and not saying this in a demeaning way, I'm just saying your actions will still contribute to microtransactions despite you not buying them).
---
lol... who‚Äôs crying? Sounds like you are! Sorry my opinion hurt you but admins do not have to allow you to express your opinion. They can delete it in a click... and there is literally nothing you can do about it if they also delete you....
---
Seriously somone needs to fire Todd Howard.
---
Great idea we could do this on a private server.   Send out invites with the criteria.
---
Yea? Well I‚Äôm outraged that you‚Äôre outraged that they‚Äôre outraged!
---
But I know if the driver is fucking shit at what they do when they crash the car.
---
pass
---
&gt; There are more of us
---
apparently not enough because at gamestops you got the game for free for buying a controller just a while after launch lmao.
---
Fuck this game and those that continue to support these terrible practices.
---
Where is it in the build menu?
---
There will be no community if bethesda don't change.
---
The difference here is that ESO is actually a tolerable game and not a buggy, broke cash grab
---
Wat?
---
/r/fo76FilthyCasuals is pretty much the only place left for them.
---
I loathe the prequels. They don't even feel like Star Wars to me. Much like 76 doesn't feel like a Fallout game.
---
even if I bring donuts?
---
Yeah because Im going to hoard junk at you until you die
---
I obviously find value on it, everyone does, that's why it is a cashgrab. It's made to force people to buy it because as I said it includes the most requested things that the playerbase has begged for.
---
They are charging people for features that should be free, because they aren't optional.
---
I do what I want little butthurt princess
---
It's because Zenimax is expanding and buying up more studios. Maybe they do over expand, but in 2017 they acquired three other studios alongside their IPs. They wanna be a juggernaut and they know online games are where the milk money is at
---
Place your survival tent near existing workbench locations and you're good to go!
---
so you already paid and pay again for updates that fix issues that the game had the whole time after launch? lmao
---
I have to admit i am wondering whether wastelanders will be free or mostly hidden behind a paywall.
---
P2w means paying money gives an actual non cosmetic advantage. Doesnt have to mean you're any more deadly lol
---
Not going to get into an argument, You made multiple posts expressing your point.  I get what you are saying and in some scenarios you are correct.  However there is a bigger picture here, and it definitely affects more than just some people.
---
The bugs are COMPLETELY reasonable to be pissed off about. The scrap box I also understand but they have the same thing in ESO with the crafting bag and that does not cause any problems. 
---
I just have seen so many people complaining that all the content was supposed to be free and they are betrayed etc etc but I don't see any actual content in this. I just see that you can pay for a private server that you can have your friends join at a reasonable price for the private server along with a few other minor perks. I also see their usually quality control which is to say none at all.
---
I browsed through a few of the haters post/comment history and not once did I see anything 76 related. One person had a bunch of gta5 comments. Not saying you have to participate in 76 subreddit to play but just seems a little suspicious.
---
I am more upset that my "private server" cannot be changed to private without me deleting all of my friends... It would be nice if they allowed us to invite, or let us decline somebody trying to join.
---
Is love to see data on that, because I've seen the exact opposite thing happening over the last few days.  My social menu went from having 5 or 6 active players per session to 30 to 35 over the past few nights.
---
I don't know if you're speaking hyperbolically or haven't actually been playing the game.
---
Say sike rn
---
That's great, you don't reply to critical questions. No wonder you made this post. Enjoy the sub, my criticism has nothing to do with you or your enjoyment.
---
You got what you paid for... did your $60 include a subscription? Nope... 
---
I‚Äôve played since the stress tests/beta day 1 with 700+ total hours now with a few characters... love the game. 
---
You want an improved game? Well that costs money. 
---
ESO has a working successful model of Fallout 1st and ESO has improved greatly.
---
Their EULA says a lot more.
---
I do, but sometimes where I'm at doesnt allow for the tent to be close and I have to walk a good distance to drop it. I know I'm being lazy, but it would be a great addition to the tent.
---
That is all I really see in this. A reasonable price for a private server and some attached perks along with truly horribly quality control.
---
Alot of people are having a bug that when you load into a private world your stash loads in fine. But if you load into a regular world after that it'll delete your entire stash. When you load back into the private world it's still gone. I personally only lost all my junk because I was worried losing my good guns. So I had them on me.
---
Definitely not positivity, but definitely a beacon of defense. It's nice to finally see this place turn against this shit game.
---
Thanks for the reply! I was really curious.
---
I am fine if you dislike anything of course as that's subjective but I would argue the Prequels definitely feel like Star Wars, even Jar Jar Binks, hated as he may be, fits into the Star Wars Universe. It's Disney's "fanfiction" trilogy that doesn't fit what-so-ever and I can argue for that;p
---
Here it is
---
I am nt crying it bothers me to see ppl like u who rather complain then do anything. Plus I am making point that you could've posted something positive instead u decide to cry and take other ppls freedom.  Y don't u ask the admins to give u charge u for permium subscription so u can be on ur own world without any negative feedback.
---
Fully agree.  I'd prefer not to block other people's carefully built camps with my throwdown tent.
---
Probably it should just repack itself when you log out, requiring manual placement again when you return.  Loses a little functionality, in that you can't a permanent added free fast-travel waystation, but it seems much fairer.  The portable stash access is plenty of added benefit as it is.
---
Outer Worlds release is still tbd for Switch :(
---
You are pathetic, what are you thinking?
---
I don't know. I'm not paying I just play the game as it is
---
Yeah, it's more proof than you provided making my stance hold up more than yours. How abut you prove I didn't do that? How about you prove your point regardless of what I say? Oh that's right, you can't.
---
My favorite part was where he said ha
---
I bought and support fallout first! But It‚Äôs naive to think there‚Äôs no chance the PTS won‚Äôt be a 1st exclusive..
---
That‚Äôs a very easy for for them to not have an over populated Test server..
---
I think you're in the wrong sub
---
But you can be with your friends at the pub, unlike in f67 where will be matched with randoms in your server.
---
I'm guilty of this if I'm being honest, but I mostly come here for the freak outs after shit hits the fan...
---
Look at your feed... it‚Äôs literally full of the same exact content... 
---
Most are not being critical, they want free stuff and nothing is ‚Äúfree‚Äù. They think others paying for things they didn‚Äôt is pay to win... cry me a river... 
---
Criticism is one thing whining is another... it‚Äôs a business not a social service.
---
Man, so many go and throw them around without knowing the distinction, I honestly don't know anymore. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I can also afford it but I don't like throw my money to the wind :)
---
well that changes things! I'm in! wait.... you do have raspberry-filled yes?!
---
I'm not being hostile or rude. I'm f76 player too. 
---
I was thinking just like you until two days ago.
---
What does their EULA state about alterations to the game?
---
 Elder Scrolls VI  will be affected by that outrageous way to develop a game i'm sure.
---
People will not buy anything from liars. M
---
Yea ESO is totally dying with their subscription service too üôÑüôÑüôÑ
---
Some people just want to play in their own space as if it was a single player rpg and thiswould work fine for them.
---
It could have been an option for those people with little downsides.    
---
Of course once you start playing with your international friends on the other side of the earth from you it could become a problem but even then, in a game like 76 about rpg exploration, building, hunting and grinding it wouldn't be nearly as much of a problem as for example in a competitive online shooter.
---
Thanks. Thought I‚Äôd get more people wanting to give it a go but oh well, SBQ is easy
---
I hate pvp and I still think this is a great idea lol gameplay would be so frantic
---
They don't care, the entire reason these systems work out for them is because they only need to hook a smaller portion that will happily shell out cash to them, or the people who have poor money management skills and cant help themselves.
---
If you roleplay, why not just mentally transfer your character from FO76 to Outer Worlds? Get super drunk in game. Who knows where you‚Äôll wake up üòâ
---
But when I'm done with the pub and my friends have gone home, what better than being at home with a rando?
---
Are you in a workshop?
---
Off topic a little, but The OuterWorlds is pretty good. Ayed about an hour last night.
---
LMAO ok chief
---
Actually, if you look at the demographics for age, a majority of the players are above 40. Look at Bethesda's forum page; a vast majority of the people on that page are old AF and still enjoy the game.
---
Hmmm okay but all I'm saying is im laughing at people who lost their stuff after subscribing. You get what you pay for. And youre paying for Bethesda to keep dragging the franchise through the mud. The problem isnt that the game is multiplayer. The problem is Bethesda and their terrible practices. And spending any money on post launch content is kinda supporting that nonsense.
---
And I managed to save them the same way without being a moronic ass towards people angry at false advertising.
---
Look it up "chief"
---
I think you miss the point, Todd. It's about keeping your word, not lying, and giving the community some dignity and respect.
---
Keep sucking now.
---
I appreciated the free flux and scrip. Also my first queen on private so it was 100% worth it. Thanks for the opportunity.
---
&gt;Bethesda could not give a shit about people whos wallets are closed to them.
---
While I agree it's cheaper to keep your current customers than obtain new ones. It's far more costly to win back someone who's already decided they aren't supporting you anymore. And that's what the comment implies. It doesn't say they will stop spending money, it says the wallet is already closed.
---
We where lied too? Before and after launch. They've treated us like actual cash cows. Is it too much to ask for a game to be functional before you start charging subscriptions 
---
Tell me if every time you clicked a movie on Netflix it began playing something else, I seriously doubt you'd be happy. They would justifiably get hate. 
---
Fallout comes out broken, a year later, it still is, they then charge extra? And you're defending it? 
---
Sure if you don't mind go play the game, ignore the sub. But we have every right to call Bethesda out. They will never change unless they feel the consequences of their practices. 
---
Like you're not going to want to hear this. But Bethesda are absolutely scummy for the way they have handled this. 
---
I'm sorry that you enjoy tossing Bethesda off but when they don't even give a reach around afterwards, how is that fair?
---
To start The Outer Worlds is ok. It is a game that will give a decent break for a week or two away from Fallout but won‚Äôt replace it. As for your reaction to the subscription, I don‚Äôt think you look at the game as a business or realize there‚Äôs more too it. If the DLC content is ‚Äúfree‚Äù how would the income stream continue from this game? How would they be able to pay for the ability to creat the new content with said non income? They can‚Äôt and there wouldn‚Äôt be any. Part of being a mature adult is looking at both perspectives and realizing the game has to creat income(which it already had super low sales as it is) for the the company and be profitable while entertaining the players. Your response is a little one sided and I think it‚Äôs good you are quitting. I think all the people that are upset should leave the game and go to ones that don‚Äôt require real world logic and thinking about more then just the ‚ÄúI want my way‚Äù factor. On that note, I hope you have a wonderful time playing The Outer worlds for two weeks. We will see you then
---
..and only for a strict amount of time, so it doesn't get monotonous..
---
Good thing there aren't any of those 'round here.
---
Wat does broken game has to do with subscription? So u saying I should continue paying for the game to better ?
---
Plus nobody said u can't enjoy the game ofcourse they r ppl who r enjoying the game but u still nt getting it u r nt in reality unfortunately, but u will wake up one of these days;)
---
"I would have let you get away with it if you didn't tell us earlier"
---
I know I only bought 1 month. Do see the actual difference for myself. Personally won't be renewing unless something added or made constant servers then I'll continue my subscription but personally rn not worth.
---
Yea unfortunately I worked last night until 3am...
---
I‚Äôll get right on that, tiger
---
Nope, I was outside of whitespring
---
Do you have pacifist turned on?
---
Do you have any mutations?
---
Did you take a workshop?
---
Are you doing a powering up event?
---
I think Bethesda will concede on one thing like give everyone a free scrapper...but what about the next thing...and next thing...and the thing after that?....honestly if you don't like the way things are going in this game it might be time to find a new game because I just see more of the same down the road...
---
damn, leaving those at home...seeds get stuck in my teeth
---
When your feed is full of. Unserious different posts and comments saying the same exact thing complaining about a game they threaten to uninstall or not play anymore is not criticism... 
---
Attacking or trashing others opinions shows how childish it is... you see at that point it‚Äôs not criticism at all... it‚Äôs their way or nothing. 
---
Have a different opinion, they then trash your opinion... sorry but it doesn‚Äôt work that way... 
---
Nothing is free especially a for profit business.
---
i have a list of about 50 people who are on almost every night, i am a dedicated merchant on 3 of my characters so i have a  alot of return customers and alot of people i buy from regularly.
---
last night it was 7 people on...7.
---
Ohh wow.   Thank you for the PSA!  I might have done exactly that too.   I really hope there is some kind of server log where Bethesda can restore what you lost.
---
You kill each other, I'll mind the donuts. Literally the best I can do... lol
---
I had seen these videos in the last post. Seem to be valid reasons behind the latest decisions by Bethesda. Sounds like Providence Equity Partners may be the actual villains, and BGS just the patsy.
---
Too bad none of rage posters on here will actually listen, as this doesn't support their latest Bethesda hate circle jerk.
---
Rabid criticism you say?
---
The private servers are badly implemented and clearly they don't control access very well right now. Bethesda has their normal quality control which is almost none so this is a buggy mess right now. 
---
However, $100/year for a private server is a reasonable price when you look at the prices for most other games. If you look at what it costs to run a private server for space engineers it is usually more than that also, same with most other games.
---
Overall most stuff in FO76 works fine (at least on PC) and people do enjoy playing it. They need to seriously fix some bugs but it is really not that many. I don't see anything early access about this game. The unlimited storage they are adding is the same thing they have in ESO that is part of the premium subscription in that game which includes the crafter bag.
---
And Outer Worlds is amazing so far!
---
No, I was high when I gave my money to Bethesda. This, my guy, is clarity.
---
In my calculations, digital bits do not have any monetary value and "services" are just inconveniences created by Bethesda and you paying to remove those inconveniences.
---
It‚Äôs pretty much a steal in the bonus atoms part.  Lower cost on sub for value of bonus atoms.
---
This is honestly the best way to look at video games. Even if you're buying a game new off the shelf at $60, you need to play... What, 10 hours before you've hit the median entertainment to cost floor? Anything above that is pretty much free entertainment. 
---
You can either buy a $60 game, or pay to watch *five* movies in theater without any concessions, or maybe three if you're buying a dvd/bluray movie.
---
And we all know what happens when you have too much of something...
---
Stop supporting this garbage all you're saying is that you love these monetization schemes
---
That's why they introduced the pay subscription now.
---
Release free Wild Appalachia DLC :
---
 *-everyone loves that-*
---
Release pay subscription:
---
 *-everyone hates that-*
---
Release free Wastelanders DLC:
---
*-everyone loves that-*
---
Release player-mod behind paywall:
---
*everyone hates that-*
---
Karma effect: Neutral.
---
I'm not talking about loot  the servers I been put in are void of people.
---
Plus Modern Warfare released yesterday so that might of affected player count.
---
I think Wastelanders will be free but I can see them placing certain perks for private servers,  like li minted quests,  items, or even companions..
---
Well, for one, it doesn't matter whether it's an id game or not: id don't make decisions on that level. For two... RAGE 2 and Quake Champions.
---
what about boysenberry? Any fruit? I just want fruit...
---
You should get used to it, it wont change, no big deal......
---
Damnit I just was doing a system reinstall and didn't think about that.
---
Unlike the company, I wasn't putting Bethesda First in my mind.
---
You will have to give it time for the server to close. If you join to fast you rejoin the previous one.
---
I hope not, Outer Worlds is amazing and I'd like to beat it before anything else comes out for 76
---
This subreddit is for this game is a place for Bethesda to look at for pure positivity and that‚Äôs it. They don‚Äôt even take criticism to account. Don‚Äôt want to offend but that‚Äôs how I feel.
---
I have quite a few mutations. Bird bones, chameleon, eagle eyes, grounded, healing factor, marsupial, plague walker, speed demon, and unstable isotope
---
Halo 3 was a great game though.
---
It is?! But there was only 1 titanic? How can they make two movies about one ship? We already know how the first one ends, there‚Äôs no coming back from that?
---
yup, i had the same thought lol
---
But passive mode?
---
F
---
I remember them saying that Increasing storage was too much coding work. Money bloody talks doesn‚Äôt it.
---
fine, sigh... I'll stop at the grocery and pick up a fruit platter..
---
Cool, you aren't bothered by Bethesda's constant bad decision making. 
---
You aren't/weren't bothered that they broke the promise to keep the atom shop cosmetic, or that some bugs that have existed since the game came out are still there, or that when they fix old bugs they often introduce new ones, or that everytime they add new content (which is rare) it is buggy as hell, or that when raids were released they were a broken joke, or the ridiculous duplication glitches.
---
But this mostly just makes you seem complacent, and because of people like you, 76 will never be a good game. You can bury your head in the sand and tell us 76 is chocolate, but it doesn't change the fact that you're eating shit
---
Omg I just paid to win this game hardcore with my subscription now I can store ALL the junk. OMG I'm going to make a house out of this extra cloth!
---
In all seriousness I hate it too and scrap storage really makes the game fun as you don't need to play inventory management simulator as much especially during end game where you farm nonstop junk.
---
\*deposits 5 Atoms in his account and watches the Fallout First Slave get on his knees, crying in appreciation\*
---
Thanks! &lt;3
---
And I wasn't doing a event or workshop, and my pacifist was off but I didn't hit him at all
---
&gt; Logic and critical thinking textbooks typically discuss slippery slope arguments as a form of fallacy but usually acknowledge that "slippery slope arguments can be good ones if the slope is real‚Äîthat is, if there is good evidence that the consequences of the initial action are highly likely to occur.
---
Not having to worry about stash space
---
You paid for a game and getting what you paid for. A subscription adds features and items that if you want them you pay just like any other game or actual real life services. 
---
Nothing is free, nothing... want the game to improve? I do!
---
Someone want to fill me in on what happened?
---
So you basicly demonize an entire fanbase for some stupid cunts who feed into microtransaction. Sound logical!
---
FO76 isn't ESO dude
---
Just an FYI- you don‚Äôt need to maintain subscription to keep that outfit.
---
Thats what iam saying just rejoin the world and the green ones will spawn again
---
If you never liked the game, and don't play, then why are you fouling up our sub?
---
"FIX FOR MACHINE GUN SOUND"
---
"ANOTHER FIX FOR SOUND"
---
Of course, I don't have any say to where you use your money. But I really do care since whales like you will guarantee that you won't ever see anything good again from Bethesda.
---
You could always dispute to your card if needed as services not delivered as promised.
---
That game is dope
---
No, I didn't think I would need it if I didn't attack back
---
Exactly
---
I do believe that would be the culprit.
---
Crazy assholes like yourself are why no one listens when we make a complaint.
---
Wastelanders has to be free, since it'll be a new map for everyone. That being said, after this .... this disaster, they will do whatever they can to punish those of us not getting the sub. I can only imagine the passive aggressive way we'll be punished.
---
Some mutations might activate as a slap if you don‚Äôt have the mode on.
---
Good to hear people enjoy it so much.
---
Is pacifist off or on?
---
Possible interaction between Plague Walker/Unstable Isotope and the other player.
---
Which features? The 1650 Atoms? The official servers? The armor set? The only one I'm even slightly agitated by is the scrapbox.
---
i giggled! those dang mr gutsies have all my legendaries!
---
Are you planning to supply it?
---
Damn really?? That's such a stupid mechanic
---
Rage 2 was Avalanche studios not ID and I thought Quake champions was free to play?
---
Regardless the relationship between the game, developers and publishers is not as straight forward as publishers being able to demand whatever they want. Different companies, people, contracts, games etc.
---
It‚Äôs not the stash the people are reporting, it‚Äôs the scrap box, and it‚Äôs a small minority of people, if we care at all about being accurate
---
I think OP is referring the the subscription fiasco that preceded the launch of Outer Worlds, and perhaps the original launch of FO76 and the negative reception followed by announcement of Outer Worlds. It‚Äôs almost like Obsidian paid Bethesda for the controversies that drove a lot of eyes and attention to Outer Worlds. But I cannot day for sure.
---
Uninstall it but first make a video of you deleting your characters. Show us all you are truly uninstalling and deleting the game... 
---
Yeah literally NO ONE is doing that... 
---
You got what you paid for... simple as that.
---
Sike
---
I just do what people tell me to do... because thinking is hard
---
I thought it meant
---
Fallout 1st
---
Meaning you are first to get feature or considered first before people without
---
Or
---
First to pay
---
Yeah it isn't a big deal so long as we detach ourselves from it and stop feeding whatever is causing this. If we keep feeding it, then we encourage it to keep doing this to the other games we are looking forward to (TES 6 and Starfield).
---
I honestly find it a little depressing to have Todd Howard (Someone who, up till about a year ago was one of the most respected and loved developers out there) crash and burn so hard. I really hope that either Fallout 76 miraculously gets better, or that Starfield and Tes 6 are really, really awesome partially just so that Todd Howard and the rest of Bethesda can earn back their reputation
---
Lol you can, it just has it's perks. I personally enjoy decorating, but if you don't want to do it you can just drop your Camp device near a convenient spot like the Whitesprings to have a free fast travel in case you need to repair or sell something (there's even a fountain that cures diseases). 
---
It's useful but not actually neccesary.
---
I had lots of fun with FO76 but keep this shit up and I‚Äôm uninstalling
---
Yawn
---
Even then, this is a huge deviation from what was promised to us. If I wanted to play a subscription based MMO, then I would have gone and bought a subscription based MMO. 
---
This game was marketed as a multiplayer game that could be played solo for a one time purchase and would never have items or content that affected game play locked away behind additional pay walls or microtransactions. 
---
Repair kits, scrap boxes, tents, and modding ALL affect game play. When repair kits came into the picture everyone got pissed but let it go. Bethesda saw this and decided to see how far they could push their luck. A mobile fast travel point is a big deal, but more so the scrap box. Stash space has been the number one complaint since launch, and now they introduce a stash for junk with unlimited space that is locked behind a pay wall? That's pretty fucking insulting imo.
---
I didn't say any of those things.
---
Is this the prevailing Reddit tactic?  Write three paragraphs yourself, pretend that the other guy wrote them, argue against your own musings, then pretend you've won an argument?
---
I, apparently, need to get with the times.
---
A beacon of toxicity perhaps, lmao.
---
Ok I get what you're saying, but it's still a little exaggerated, don't you think? Lol
---
This.   So much this.
---
&gt; If we weren't right all the time, how'd we get all this money?
---
That gave me a chuckle. It would be bad business if that's not exactly how they look at it, so you are probably right too.
---
Yeah pretty much. I think maybe they over-expanded, and that they have had some projects (Starfield and TES 6) that are consuming resources like mad, and that maybe hit some development issues.
---
Probably patch in single player and forget about it.
---
If they don't then modders will and it will be glorious
---
This is all just one big waiting game
---
In other words we have no way to restore items because we worked on this instead of a proper restore system.
---
I saw some disent among the casuals, but I think the sub rules don't allow any criticism. But I think they will appear to support FO1st just to virtue signal that they're "not like the other sub". We are so off the trail though with games in 2019. We don't own them, can't host our own servers when the game eventually shuts down because the map data is off limits. Cash shop in a USD60 game. Bugs that persist that modders have fixed in other games. They really need a change up over there with their team. There are people capable of making the game great, and it already has many good things going for it.
---
did you ever get one of the rare Fasnacht mask?
---
Or, it could be the fact that a private equity firm owns 30%+ of Zenimax, and either want to pay dividends, or is looking to inflate Zenimax's net worth prior to selling.
---
That's it. Pacifist is off, so he attacked you and one of your mutations that can damage other players triggered and damaged him, which counted as an attack.
---
Same happen with electrically charged, which I have. It's why I make sure Pacifist is on unless I am hunting a bounty, and even at that I am careful.
---
It would explain why it‚Äôs called ‚Äúfallout 1st‚Äù. You get first access. I‚Äôm fine with that.
---
If people buy into these practices I doubt they really care what is being stated
---
I think I‚Äôm done with fallout 76. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs fun in there but the problems with the game make it impossible to find. Adding this paid bullshit is the last straw for me.
---
Everyone talking about Outer Worlds...I see that game as having 40 to 50 hours of playtime before you finish...hope it has some replay value
---
My point exactly, after reading many of them they state they are uninstalling the game or have deleted the game... ironically not one of them will post a video of them deleting their characters... they‚Äôll never show that...lol
---
Wish I had.
---
&gt;Bethesda is financially crippled
---
You have absolutely 0 proof
---
Nah, it's because those who are left in this absolute mess of a game are absolute cultists for Bethesda, and will buy anything Todd throws at them and then thank him for it.
---
&gt;So until I know with 100% certainty
---
Lol, it's Bethesda there is no 100% certainty that anything will work correctly ever.
---
It's just junk. Keep the good junk in your stash box (Stable Flux, Screws etc.) everything else can easily be replaced. Junk is very easy to find.
---
You clearly didn‚Äôt play it on launch! I can remember when the best item in the game where effectively locked behind a paywall. 
---
Back way before One Tamriel, the material for the best armour (veteran level 16), came from dlc only content so unless you wanted to spend a massive amount of gold you had to get the DLCs together the resources to craft the gear. Oh and the sets required you to have effectively played for a year to even craft.  None of that kind of shit would have sticked before launch. By the way half the things you get with eso+ went there to begin with. For an opening gambit, fallout first is a good offering but it needs more improvement, like double scrip capacity. 
---
Hopefully they‚Äôll make it so you can buy a month of fallout first with 1650 atoms (like you can buy eso+ for 1500 crowns).
---
Pacifist was off, and I had no diseases so it must have been unstable isotope
---
So you‚Äôve got 70hrs of enjoyment out of a game you paid $60 over a year ago for?
---
So .85 cents per enjoyment hour? Sounds like a deal to me
---
I didn‚Äôt buy it because I server hop for vendors nowadays. Gameplay experience is still the same, boring. 
---
I think a lot of the outrage and outcry comes from the unlimited junk stash being stored behind a paywall. Especially since Bethesda said that they can‚Äôt increase the stash size due to server stability. As well the addition of atoms, which is this subreddits favorite currency. Probably made some people mental even though they‚Äôre following the same business model as ESO. (Even though the ESO model has a lot more to offer) 
---
Personally I would have probably owned my own server if it was through Nitrado like how ARK is, where I can change the settings and values as I please. (Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong on this part because I don‚Äôt own one and only hear through the trees about what a player can and can‚Äôt due with their server).
---
I chuckled when I heard people saying repair kits are p2w. This scrap box though. P2w still doesn't seem accurate for it but I'm not laughing now.
---
How is it 'more' than something when you have provided absolutely zero?
---
Lol this community is funny! Even talk about this stuff and you get downvoted üòÇ I live for your hate boys gimme it üòòüòò
---
I think it's unstable isotope that does this. Only reason not to have pacifist mode on is to open yourself up to pvp.
---
im sorry that happened to you!
---
No change for me, though I have noticed server lag decrease in public servers, probably due to some
---
Behind the scenes improvements. There isn‚Äôt as much lag when scrolling through vendor inventory for me.
---
I can‚Äôt believe that people on this sub are now just finally realizing how shitty Bethesda is with fallout 76, that‚Äôs the most amazing part
---
It just works!
---
Only if you want to experience the wrath of my wife lol, you are very welcome though! Happy to help you find some happiness along the way.
---
So this is not a visual issue, if it were then I'd still be able to craft with the scrap even though I can not see it. But when I goto craft it will not allow me to craft anything all all. So Bethesda is lying about it being a visual issue. If you can please direct me to when I might be able to speak to them plz and thank you.
---
Fuck em. I love my Subscription, I love my private server and my bouns. I've put over 2k hours into this game so I feel like I deserve this type of thing. I guess I'm entitled tho lol
---
FYI they said they are adding this feature.
---
One thing I would worry about is if FO76 turns out to be their relatively most successful release in recent years, because the others are doing worse. That is, 76 might not be as profitable as Skyrim or Fallout 4, but more so than Rage 2, Wolfenstein, maybe even Doom Eternal (pre-order sales did not seem great on Steam the last time I checked) and Starfield (not easy to sell a new IP when you have a terrible reputation). Would that be seen by ZeniMax Media as a reason to move further away from traditional single player, offline games towards GaaS, microtransactions, and mobile?
---
Yeah I hopped after the 3rd death, thanks for the info
---
Not one single video of people deleting their characters before uninstalling the game as they have stated they did... 
---
I question if many even had the game to begin with. They claim they uninstalled it but still belong to the Fallout 76 community??? 
---
Right...
---
I don‚Äôt think the atom shop is really p2w I got my fridge, scrapbot, scrap kits and a bunch of goofy stuff I get atoms constantly for just completing challenges I wasn‚Äôt even aware of
---
Ah yes, the same type of reddit post being made a year ago for some other nonsensical reason.  Everyone is really excited to get to feel like they are changing the world by outraging over an admittedly lackluster initial offering for a subscription service.    
---
This outrage stuff is getting so tiring.  Bethesda doesn't care about your post.  They know you either don't play, or don't speak on behalf of a population that does.
---
Is it that vague? I'm sorry, if it is, but i thought everyone will get right away what i'm talking about. Still, just to be clear, /u/pb8185 is absolutely correct.
---
No one said FO76 is devoid of criticism. They were pointing out that the rules of r/FO76filthycasuals explicitly states that complaints are not allowed. You will literally get banned for talking negatively about the game in *any* way.
---
I believe you, and thats terrible
---
I played last night and it was noticably worse than usual.
---
I hope their plan isnt "just buy the membership if you want the game to run correctly"
---
LOL good one Todd. We know its you.
---
Yesterday. I was planning on playing this game for a long time. I know i cant compete against people Who play efficiently and a lot, but im totally against greedy practices when it simply wont stop.
---
I looked past every controversy, which i now realize is a mistake. They will continue to get greedier if we let them.
---
I will play it again if scrapbox is for everyone, even though it means less fun since item management was always fun to me. Now its just looting. 
---
Being good at managing your survival equiptment is a skill too imo, which along with my favourite mode "survival" is now gone, too.
---
Im just scared to waste even more time on a game that could destroy itself anyday with even more controversial actions. They need to be shown that people arent willing to get scammed. 
---
Consumers need to stand up right now, imo.
---
The game already got worse twice this month alone for me, i have yet to see improvements. Im level 94 and just did my own thing all this time.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüññüèæüññüèæ
---
Oh I thought that definition was going to go in a completely different direction.
---
Totally agree
---
&gt;one of the few that still enjoy the game
---
Huh...one of the few? The servers have been packed with people the last couple of days. Also, like a lot of people, I'm perfectly good with their choice on FO1st and from the looks of it online so are a huge amount of players.
---
yes, to be honest, it has.
---
there's flat out nothing to do, and it's absolutely laughable they want a subscription service for this game providing absolutely nothing new. the new content they've added over the last year is hilariously small for any mmo on the market.
---
"oh look, another non player" you'll probably reply to me like it's some big deflector shield of facts and logic
---
I threw in over 400 hours for some dumb fucking reason. Two characters, and then I started multiboxing and PLAYING two accounts at once a few months before I basically gave up.
---
I''m done until wastelanders, because after the event changes there's usually not even an event worth doing up now. So it's been a month or so I guess since I've really hopped on? And even before that I basically only kept logging on to play with some streamers and their communities, like the game was a social platform. 
---
So I'd rather people make a product that's good because they want to make something people will enjoy, not just something they can get more profit from. It's the typical capitalist perversion invading another series I enjoyed. Here, we've added basically nothing new, and of the minimal content we have added, half of it depends on a good and stable server. Please pay us monthly to be better in this.
---
I'd be happy to buy DLC and spend money if there was an actual product to buy. I'm not poor. It's not an issue of being entitled and wanting free shit.  There just isn't 60+$13/mo worth there.
---
And just think, now the game code recognises the switch to a private server. So wait a while and the modding community will have a mod out to run on personal server hardware not online servers. Then the real fun begins.
---
I would do this but pur playgroup with id about 12 people or 3 raid groups who consistently are active and do all 3 difficulties of the raid daily decided with this to pool resources into the junk machine this way we have a constant influx of supplies sort of like a guild bank. So losing all that junk would actually have an impact. Obviously the valuable stuff people keep but every once in awhile you need those odd resources.
---
I cant wait to get off work so I can play more. Lol
---
I see, you're confused xD
---
Did you ever work  ... anywhere?
---
My same thinking...have I lost anything no...am I afraid to...yes...so not being able to use something that is subscription based should have an extension
---
It's different from the single player games though where in the single player games, you choose a set of mods and those are your mods. I have probably 20gb worth of mods running on my current Fallout 4 playthrough, but that's fine, because I only had to download it once. In Fallout 76 though, I'd need to download all of the mods for each server I want to join, which could end up becoming a ton of bandwidth.
---
The other thing to keep in mind is Bethesda's charging outlandish prices for vanity items from the Atom Shop. If they're able to get $10 for an outfit, they're going to be reluctant to let people upload mods with new costumes / skins, because inevitably someone will come along and make a better version of that $10 outfit that you could mod in for free.
---
You're dismissing/minimizing possibly the worst/most telling thing Bethesda has done with 76 so far and assigning it as a result of outrage culture. 
---
The reality is most people see the shit that this game is, how bad this update is, and that if you have no problem with it then you are complacent. Your post just looks like an attempt to show that the overwhelming backlash on basically every outlet/platform that gives a crap about this is just outrage
---
Some can trigger PvP it‚Äôs your mutations doing it.
---
For sure. I bet it will cost $20 or be part of the subscription. They seem to be taking ideas from ESO that make the most money, but didn‚Äôt take the ideas that make the game better.
---
Nah just human.  Dumb would be me acting as if I didn‚Äôt behave the same ways in other situations, or me believing I am somehow ‚Äúabove such behavior.‚Äù Lol
---
Just leave already man. I can't believe you seriously made a reddit account JUST to whine on a public forum. There's nothing unfair about Fallout 1st. There has been no slight, either real or perceived. There's just you and people like you who think that everything should be handed to you for free. Thankfully you guys are just a loud minority, and will eventually fade away.
---
I'm not trying to say that you aren't allowed to enjoy the game. OP is talking about a giving them more money while also saying:
---
&gt; Yes before you hate on me for paying, i am against it also.
---
Why is throwing more money at a company that have proven to not give a single fuck about any of their customers and will promise things like "only cosmetic micro transactions" or "canvas bags" and then not honoring them?
---
I used to a huge Bethesda fan. I loved Skyrim. I enjoyed Fallout 4. Hell, even though I know Fallout 76 is objectively a trash game, running around collecting stuff was cathartic to some extent.
---
But if Bethesda knows you're going to throw money at them **even if they delete all your scrap**, isn't that going to be detrimental to **YOUR OWN** experience? Or maybe the unpredictability is the fun part? Like gambling?
---
Anyway, I want people to stop giving them money personally so they have an incentive to make games I enjoy. Fallout 76 is a flop even if it has some regulars.
---
If their hadn't fucked the game into a money grab they'd be having more game sales. Also that's what the atom store was for, generating revenue
---
Your not entitled for buying something anyone can buy and enjoying it dudeü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
The OP is here for karma only.  Make no mistake, most of the people posting, complaining, re-linking, and creating articles around this are not fallout 76 players, nor did they ever have an intention of being one(again).
---
Are you saying a large corporation simply refuses to pay costs against it as decided by the courts? Governments generally take a *very* dim view of that kind of corporate behavior. When it went back to court, that corporation is quite likely to find themselves paying huge fines plus even more money to the individual.
---
Whats he talking about then?
---
Up on every list? Okay, show me those lists. Because right now, it has 450 players on Xbox. 
---
How many does RDR2 have? 20k. ESO? 20K. For Honor? 19k. Skyrim, 19k. ***Fallout 4, 119k***... and so on and so on.
---
I know the truth can hurt, son. But it's living in denial isn't healthy for you.
---
McSalt, I don't even know why you ditched your head out of your rear to tell that. Since you like being scammed and lied to and robbed while remaining silent,  could you just keep doind that at your best and get the fuck out off reddit please! If you can't at least listen to ppl complaining, you re right, you just deserve to live alone in a dark small with only your computer as a friend. You ll never get out off comfort zone Dat way
---
If theyre following you between games theyre probably on your friends list.
---
Yeah, I guess that‚Äôs right. If they continue doing online games like fo76, I‚Äôd atleast hope they would wait a while before doing another tho
---
Craft at armor workbench
---
&gt; People get mad if a product at Walmart is overpriced 
---
But they don't get any madder than people at reddit going full tantrum over 10 dollars a month. Reddit users(especially gamers) are some of the most sensitive easily triggered demographics I've ever seen
---
I don't disagree, just going by complaints that I've seen and trying to find a way to circumvent it.
---
Yes, after 70 hrs of gameplay I've got tired of doing the same events and listening to tapes from dead NPCs. The game just can't be compared to any other Fallout.
---
It‚Äôs literally the same company involved and the ESO plus model mirrors the Fallout 1st one... compare and contrast them...
---
How are you scammed? You don‚Äôt need to buy the subscription... how did the game get worse? I still don‚Äôt understand. Did they take some features away from you? And how are you level 94 without excavator armor? Seems very suspicious...
---
It‚Äôs at the armor crafting station. It has a 1st symbol next to it.
---
How would that make any difference to this situation?
---
So you gonna stay here just to complain about something you don't even care about? What a champ.
---
The reason companies lying about their products is ok is because of complacent people like you who'll roll over no matter what the company says rather than demanding a quality product
---
Thank you...? Not sure why I have a cake next my name but hey, who doesn't love cake?
---
I haven't followed Fallout 76 closely, but I have been following gaming news with regards to monetization practices from the large developers in general. To be fair, from what little I know, I think BGS are getting way more stick than they deserve. 
---
Specifically about the private servers and the ability to mod, I get the impression of a lack of unison within the studio with regards to what direction they want to take this game. Fallout became a household name because of the single player titles and BGS's idea to cater to that audience who also want to experience Fallout 76 is Private servers. Not a single player game! A multiplayer map, that only you (and a limited amount of friends) have access to. I'd love to know how much that would cost for PUBG talk of the COD's and Battlefield's of this world? There's no way in heaven or hell such a thing would be free.
---
Perspective is important. The truth is just like ESO, Fallout 76's life cycle could very well end up being indefinite. Content release might improve down the years and end up shaping a game that looks nothing like how it did in it's first 12 months.
---
Words can't express how upset I am that now this game is going to be left to die withing 2 years. This is the thing that will drive people away from the whole online experience with Fallout. 
---
Great job Vault Tec, your rep Todd told us there was plenty of room in the Vaults for all of us, but really he meant the ones that could pay. The rest of us who watched this amazing vault be built and cared for by the community were just left out on the day the bombs dropped.  I feel like the Vault tec rep from Fallout 4, arguing why I should be allowed in, but really who cares.
---
Since they only seem to care about cash, make note Bethesda since you guys monitor stuff like this. I am a owner of a NZXT 500i Vault Boy case (Vault  #437), Super Sledge, Liberty Prime, Fusion Core (which I was setting up to activate the case) Dog Meat, multiple LPs including Doom and had the Fallout 4 and Fallout 3 vinyl set to order next week so I would have them for Xmas. Yea that's all over. 
---
It's not about the money B, because lord knows I was about to spend a few hundred on just records. It's about a grown man who was in the middle of the worst moments of his life, finding hope in a game series that honestly helped to keep him alive, only to be gut punched once he was out of the vault and be told I have to pay to get into the better vault. 
---
All of my heroes are showing me this month, there are no heroes, only people who will eventually give up on you too.
---
I really wonder where everyone gets this ‚ÄúBethesda didn‚Äôt promise us this game!!!‚Äù When they came out and said this was going to be an MMO game.  Then it came out and was an MMO and people were shocked
---
Really?  How long have you been here?  As far back as I can remember, this sub has been a beacon of *criticism* and internet rage.  If you want a beacon of positivity , check out the fo76 filthy casual sub.
---
If people like me wouldnt exist, the atomic shop would look a lot different, utility items would be the norm. Pay2win would be the norm. You should thank us for having the game youre playing right now, because without us, they'd have no Limits to their greed.
---
You call it whining, i call it Feedback.
---
But, it doesn't affect normal players. How did the game change for a normal player before/after the update?
---
If I think a product at Walmart is overpriced, I either shop around, or don't buy it. I've never had a door greeter try to strong-arm me into buying anything.
---
What a waste of good coffee...
---
I bet that sounded funny before you typed it.
---
Yes, this is true.
---
The point is that there is more economic pressure on them now to produce these kinds of things than there used to be.
---
You haven't been looking at the right places, A, and B you can still only loot it once or global reset.
---
Btw the best place to farm lead is Lucky Hole Mine. Ore nodes are instanced per player. Now stop whining and go play.
---
yeah ikr, I went back to FO4 playing the Depravity mod with around 60 other mods running and I doubt I will be back on 76. The subscription was honestly the final straw for me. I had some fun out of the game but its become a cynical money grubbing machine like most AAA titles are.
---
When are they planning on adding that? I feel it was misrepresented when they showcased this as an already in the game feature by the way they advertised "you can play alone or invite up to 7 friends". I would have appreciated it more if they said it was a server instance that up to 7 friends can join you on/in a further update these will be able to be set to private.
---
Interesting bit about the possibility of the company going public. The conspiracy theorist would wonder if that might have anything to do with the recent delays of both Doom Eternal and Wastelanders to Q1 2020? What I mean is that they might want to time those releases to happen shortly after entering the public stock market, so they can increase the value of the company. Of course, this is only a wild theory and the releases are most likely simply not ready yet.
---
Are we talking about my avatar or something else? I'm a bit concerned, because that is actually my face there...
---
Yoooooooooooooooong out
---
&gt;That was literally this sub until Bethesda decided to repeatedly lie and become greedier and greedier with MTX
---
No, it was not. I joined the sub on the day of it's creation. It was done because from the get go this sub was toxic and had a ton of people that did not even play the game. A simple look at the profiles of the most virulent, hateful posters will show you that a large chunk of them do not play, or at least play regularly. Not saying that's you, just a general observation
---
&gt; Providence Equity Partners
---
They've invested about half a billion into Zenimax.
---
As you say, they don't give a shit about the ins and outs of games and are just concerned with the bottom line for their shareholders.
---
There was most likely an edict from on high that Bethesda/Zenimax need to up the revenue after a string of underperforming titles.
---
Big "pledge" can cost 20k and more but to play the game you can spand 35$ and be good to have all ship...
---
The 20 k $ are more of a donation a this point... a taxed donation
---
Wow seriously i think the only sensitive one here is you mate smh.
---
Yeah me too, come on Bethesda why
---
To me there is a lot of quality in the models of the tent, to be honest. Have you seen it? Best purchase I have ever made.
---
You could have just got the Ranger outfit mod if that's all you wanted from the sub. It was available first day.
---
I hate those. I usually get like 30 atoms or less because I refuse to waste my time for a ridiculous amount of Atoms. 
---
Go to gulper lagoon and kill a gulper? Sure. Kill a legendary near a fissure? Hell no, I have better stuff to do than praying it spawns. And I used to do the alcohol crafting but never again, they are so fucking boring and time consuming. They even turned the Camera into a boring challenge instead of an enjoyable feature.
---
Still didnt answer my question just like anyone else when presented with it. How is this any different than what eso offers. And why is eso as popular as it is?
---
Yeah...but they're not the same. Yeah, they're both online, yes they're both under Zenimax, yes they both originate from BGS. But, one is an actual MMO and was marketed as an MMO, and the other is a Rust like 24 player max server game.
---
Also, the benefits you get are totally different. It's like comparing Warframe with World of Warcraft.
---
Oh ffs...you want to get government involved because you dont like a video game? Really? Is this real life?
---
My god, thought I'd seen everything with the shitshow going on in here the last few days, but this..lordy me. People have lost their minds. I wish people would put their energies to more important things, but here we are.
---
Ditch PA and invest in Agility and Covert Operative
---
I think its more a start if more to come then just what it is now. Once they go subscription they'll want to keep 1st's the happiest. So have no illusions, more 1st exclusives are on the way. Those who are not will be forgotten. That is the dark cloud, the storm to come will only become worse.
---
when i start reading your comment i was not sure where you were going with this. i ended up laughing. thanks for the laugh man.
---
I think it's reasonable to pay for a private server, hosted remotely. I'm more concerned about the direction they're going with paid advantages like unlimited junk storage and whatever the tent is supposed to do.
---
Really? Source?
---
&gt; if you pay for one thing they should have added free
---
What "should" they have added free and why?
---
And the obvious solution (the one I'm using) is not to pay for things you don't want to pay for.
---
+ 5% of outraged kids who can't stand that other ppl criticize their beloved scammy game on reddit!! Can't wait for them to see their own bank account robbed next time they get scammed and not their parent's one ^^
---
Then you maybe wouldn't image such unworldly BS. Like a lot of persons here. 
---
Or are you an EA bot?
---
Sensitive AND entitled! It‚Äôs like if you buy a game they should give you every other thing revolving around the game for free!
---
Private servers and scrap box. Idc at all about the other ones as they do not give any advantage in gameplay. Private servers were promised to be a thing for everyone and the unlimited scrap storage was said to be impossible to be in the game due to server instability. They don't mind lying if they can get money for it.
---
lol you gotta comment for maximum karma go ahead
---
Seriously! I'm skipping leg day for it. Just hit level 2 and trying to decide what perk to pick, but they're all so fucking good! 25% run speed or 20% sprint speed, 50lbs carry limit increase or fast travel while encumbered...and so many others.
---
They add a payed membership if you pay 12 USD a month you can get stuff you should be able to have for free like you got to pay for private sever and other stuff which sucks
---
One day after it is announced is a bit early, friend.
---
You need to wait a long time to see how something like this impacts a game.
---
Yeah, urm... no.
---
I've been playing the game since the second beta. Couldn't play the first because my game decided to redownload itself, as it did with pretty much everyone. (That should have been a sign of things to come...)
---
When the fridge and scrap bot were added to the ATOM store, I was annoyed. I held off buying them because I thought "Surely the backlash from this will make them relent and give them to us for free?" However, the sour taste that left was still there.
---
Then I was hoping that the last patch would make things better. Improve on the game and show Bethesda turning things around. The promise of private worlds helped. They were listening to us!
---
And then this bullshit happened.
---
I've been playing and defending the game since day 1. No more though. Bethesda have lost my trust, and lost me as a player.
---
Really? Where have you been for the last two days?
---
this is 100% accurate.
---
they should have made the "private servers" and atoms be the only thing that came with the subscription, and added the tent, outfit and emotes/icons to the atomic shop, then given everyone the scrap box either for free, or as a quest reward (the tent also really could have been play related).  they could even give everything but the scrap box for free as a bonus with getting the subscription.   they would have ultimately had the more or less the same number of people get the subscription, but they would have also had all those atoms spent on the 2 "utility" items. (and way less outrage)
---
*BLOCKING* the tent and scrap box behind the pay wall was incredibly stupid.   thats exactly why people are mad.
---
Being passive aggressive is weak af... gets old really quick. Learn to express yourself without making rude comments and maybe you can be more successful. 
---
I pay for what I like and enjoy, simple as that. Nothing is free so get over it. 
---
Think your words here complaining will change anything? Sorry it‚Äôs a business designed to make money and provide services to those who pay like any other business.
---
See the variable? Other people.
---
I must disagree, the negativity here since the beta drove all the positive people to other subs like the filthy casual one and others. This sub has become the Donald of fallout subs.
---
Off topic. Do the raids perform better on private servers. I assume they do which is a real kick in the teeth to all the non-subscribers.
---
Also given you play with 12 other players couldn't you just use an alt to check player vending? Then a friend could help you mule your wares. 
---
I assume this is your main reason for wanting to go on the public servers.
---
Holy shit, but hey the people that are willing to pay Bethesda for it are just asking for stupid shit Bethesda won't fix
---
So go buy any one of a million different games and see if that keeps you infinitely happy idk man shit $60 and played for 70 hours sounds like a great game to me. I wish I could get 70 hours out of every game I‚Äôve ever paid full price for.    What would it take for you to be happy? How bout Bethesda has to come to your house and give you an old fashioned once you played for 75hrs?
---
There are only 2 games I currently play with over 800 hours this, and civilization 6. I have spent WAY more on civ dlc.  I guess it is subjective.
---
The increasingly aggressive microtransactions, the constant delays, pathetic Q&amp;A, and now this subscription service has pretty much done for me. I am back to Fallout 4 with the Depravity Mod and about 50 others and having a ball. Bethesda has become just as bad as EA and Ubisoft etc... for the hideos nickel and dimming. They started on this path back with the Oblivion Horse Armour and its been a steady march towards becoming another AAA cynical money hungry corporation. Had my fun with the game but doubt I will be back unless Wastelanders is really outstanding.
---
Here is Providence Equity's own video too:
---
\*standing ovation\*
---
Watching this entire fiasco actually seeing people kill each other here has been a truly eye opening experience there is sensitivity on both sides.
---
He knows, his tin foil hat told him.
---
Ah thanks
---
No, friend. I'm not saying they're equally as bad, just that darkness and specifically greed leads to not being able to look at yourself as bad or wrong no matter what you're doing. That was my main point xD
---
There are plenty of things to be outraged about.
---
A video game company selling an optional service that has no effect on me in any way isn't one of them.  You don't think that outrage culture has something to do with hundreds of people making memes out of themselves on a FO subreddit for days over something as fucking trivial as an optional subscription service that had no effect on them?
---
You guys take these games way too seriously and, apparently, don't take the real world seriously enough.
---
Seriously.  The fact that the phrase "overwhelming backlash" can even be used with a straight face when discussing video games is laughable.
---
Are you trying to sell Fallout 1st to people? Because making the game full PvP would be incentive to get private worlds.
---
Does everybody who plays fallout 76 read reddit?  Highly unlikely.
---
If they did, nobody would play the game because of all the childish hate directed at Bethesda.
---
I'm sure Bethesda reads reddit and laughs.
---
Both offer unlimited scrap storage
---
Both offer in game gold/atoms in subscription 
---
Both offer members only free items
---
The list goes on... the subscription model is identical. Yes worlds are different since it‚Äôs a different game but subscription is spot on identical.
---
hahaha will do
---
As much as they need to make this game great.
---
Surely, you jest.
---
See you in a couple of days then?
---
Agreed.  I think the second camp and the scrap thing shouldn't be part of it, and should be included for what we already paid.  The private games, special outfits, and the free atoms are more than acceptable for a subscription service.
---
I'm really not that bugged about the second camp, it's been requested a lot, but as much as I'd like to see it in the base game, I get that you could call that a premium feature.  But the scrap thing, after being told that it wasn't possible before, suddenly being possible for extra money really rubs me the wrong way.
---
This. The game is more active than it has been in months. The loud 5% is here on reddit screaming about "WHERE MUH FREE STUFFS" while the other 95% are too busy relishing the fact that junk doesn't take up stash space anymore.
---
Hi Todd
---
Maybe 76 is the sacrificial lamb, that will let them keep ES6 and FO5 from being heavily MTX'd.
---

---
That's fair.
---
hi, i cant access the link at work, can you please cut paste the reply here? if you have time of course, sorry to ask this but im behind a firewall at work
---
True true, never thought I'd give Anthem props for anything x)
---
Woah there tiger
---
There's a big fucking distinction between different ideas of things and being told different things
---
We where told no pay2win/game altering atom shop items
---
Theres twitter evidence of that. They lied about that.
---
They also lied about charging a base fee for the game forever.
---
So the company has flat out lied. They've misled us about what they wanted this game to be and what their plans are. 
---
It's nothing to do with simply not liking it, that's why there is such a backlash.
---
But if you want to swallow then I suppose you better ask Todd to be gentle
---
&gt; I would‚Äôve bought it just for the atoms
---
legit.  theres a ton of people (myself included) who would have bought it atleast once, just for the atoms.   all Beth would need to do, is make the membership enticing/valuable enough that it would hook players into continuing it.
---
now i have a sinking suspicion that theres going to be some legal backlash from people who paid the yearly fee when the game doesnt even survive that long
---
I mean sure, i'm not claiming that seriously, i'm not trying to create some stupid conspiracy theory (there's already too much of those), but it's seems just so amazing how Bethesda can screw up so much accidentally.
---
And no XD
---
You were never lied to. You guys have modified the promise in your own minds to suit your narrative. They promised all DLCs would be free. Not all future content.
---
Like they care. Be very very afraid lmao.
---
Yes, because I have a single criticism about 1st and that's the scrap box. I don't care what people pay for. I care about what is being sold.
---
OK thanks :)
---
Lol, if you can assume, then so can I. But the difference between you and me, is that I know the value of money and not just sit in a reeking man cave studio apartment, feeling justified spending $100 a year on something digital, unlike your stinking ass BO.
---
Shit, does this mean no new elder scrolls games?
---
I'd assume they'd just shut their doors if they are financially crippled.
---
You bought the game correct? 
---
Did the game you paid for include a subscription? No... 
---
Does the subscription effect your individual play? No...
---
Can you still play exactly the same way as you‚Äôve played? Yes...
---
That was the launch day but ok
---
Noone killed anyone. Relax bro it's just a game. This is what I mean by sensitive people smh
---
If the EULA says the game costs $60, but they advertise and sell it elsewhere at $30, they can't claim you owe them another $30 because of the EULA.
---
THIS GUY IS A HERO!
---
A closed beta which was... CLOSED? Dude you must be shitting me!
---
That's two separate conversations. Opposite of consumer: retailer. Opposite of perpetrator: victim. Develoepers are retailers and no crime has been committed against any person. Let's not encourage meaningless vitriol.
---
Not one person is forced to entertain in-game transactions and engage so much to the point where it becomes a pay-to-win and I'm talking about multiplayer games in general, not just BGS. Service based products are a reflection of demand... which is why they still thrive, despite what seems many times to look like apocalyptic backlash.
---
A single candle seems a blazing beacon in the cold void of space
---
Wha
---
That would be best. If that really is the case, I wouldn‚Äôt even be that disappointed with how Fo76 turned out if it means we get better games in the future
---
&gt;"This is technically the only thing to do...its a move similar to boycott"
---
More like a protest that blocks of streets because they don't like a recently elected official.  It's designed to be an annoyance not to the official or company but to the bystanders who just want to drive to work or in this case just enjoy what they can of the game.
---
&gt;"because the game will have a very low player base and therefore die."
---
Yep, then it will therefore fail because of enough people no longer showing interest in the product, not because people decided to aggressively try to damage the playerbase.
---
You still didn't address my ending point.  You're only posting in this sub because of Fallout 1st, otherwise you wouldn't be here.  You and I both know it's true, I came here to do the same thing, but seeing the constant spam it's clear that since we lost interest long before it we shouldn't be here to try and fuel the hate with irrelevant baseless spam.
---
Your PS4 is probably your most expensive possession
---
I've been active here since launch
---
I 100 percent support the people complaining. They have every right too.
---
I don't support this post though since it's just immature fucking garbage akin to brexit in my country. "no one cares hurhur, you lost we won get over it"
---
Thank you, we will!
---
The tinfoil hat keeps OUT the voices. Haha, you dumb dumb
---
I paid $80 for this god damn game, why the hell do I have to pay ANOTHER $100
---
Well I only preorder to have beta access, wanted to see how bad the game really is. Never plant to not refund it
---
This is, more or less, my current full-health/junkie rifle build 
---

---
&gt;Reddit is a very tiny portion of the playerbase
---
I was wondering about this and this is only English speaking users too.
---
i dont think many people will be joining lots of servers unless there is a way to join random servers with mods you like,i can think of a few ways to do it without people joining needing to download all the mods it depends what way they want to add them,as for people choosing free mods over the 10 dollar outfit the mods arent free they need a subscribtion
---
Yes, but I have proof that the title was a perfect clickbait title
---
Or the people ‚Äúleft‚Äù just like the game, or enjoy the general aspect of the gameplay. I was going to buy atoms to get the Halloween stuff from the atomic shop until I read the specifics of the subscription and found out all the stuff you get, including a ton of atoms, so I felt like I was coming out on top tbh. I‚Äôm planning on canceling my subscription unless I would get some great shit in return for a another 12 bucks (which isn‚Äôt a big deal really) because I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll really even play on the private servers because I like playing with everybody else and visiting camps which is really the main thing I do.
---
Maybe we should accept it will never be great. Not with the rotten foundation
---
Once your subscribed to 1st there will be a 1st tab in the atom shop with the items for free. Then you can craft them.
---
Sure, keep downplaying it buddy. I bet you thought the backlash from Star Wars: TLJ was unwarranted, too.
---
Here's and idea! Since you are too busy with real world stuff, how about you get of Reddit and fold some more fucking laundry, because you aren't being of any use here :D!
---
You just can't convince these people. They've twisted their perception of it to fit their argument. It almost makes me nauseous, to be honest.
---
Well, it keeps those in your head inside tho.
---
what mod?
---
Does not negate being lied to. And for that I am upset. The game is there, with minimal content a year after release and still running poorly and riddled with bugs. Not acceptable for a AAA title. No amount of love for this company changes that..... to me at least.
---
"Admittedly shaky release"
---
like bro, the game didn't work
---
newsflash - It never has worked
---
The only people that play this game have some sort of mental disability like masochism, or schizophrenia where-in the voice in their head convinced them that fallout 76 is real life or something like that. I don't know why people give this game so many chances.
---
Anyone who bought FO76 clearly had a lapse in judgment. It was clear from day 1 that FO76 was going to turn into an even worse travesty than it already started as. It actually blows my mind that a lot of people keep throwing money at shit products. What part of the incredibly rushed, buggy, crap graphics, no npc, no storyline, no actual purpose of the game inspired people to buy FO76?
---
The multiplayer? Fuck the multiplayer. If anything, people should have told Bethesda to suck it for making FO's first multiplayer experience into a clear, CLEAR cash grab pile of shit.
---
Is it FOMO? Dumb ass friends got it so now you have to get it? Get rid of those dumb ass friends, or better, explain to them that they vote with their wallet.
---
The only way the gaming industry goes back to providing a completed game at release, with clear content goals and transparent pricing options for DLC not attached to fucking games of chance is if we stop giving them our money. STOP GIVING THESE ASSHOLES YOUR MONEY.
---
Does it have loot boxes? Don't buy it. Is progression attached to $$$? Don't fucking buy it. Is it the same exact game with only a roster change for $60 base price? DON'T FUCKING BUY IT.
---
You're nothing more than a ressource to them. All they do is building tools to strip mine you of your currency. They have no respect towards their customers/fan base whatsoever. The fact that you're surprised is kind of funny, albeit in a sad way.
---
What does a person win exactly? 
---
When we all bought the game did it include a subscription or offer one to buy? Nope... 
---
Can you play the game exactly the same as when you bought it? Yes... 
---
Did you read the EULA that you accepted and agreed to? Probably not... and there‚Äôs your problem...
---
Oh so it pulls you to the main screen then drops you right back into the same server?
---
This. I had to leave the atom shop and go back in after subscribing to get the tab to show up
---
They said it is likely a visual glitch they are working to fix. Very few people actually lost anything.
---
Funny, when was the last time we saw anything about TES that wasn't just a title screen? And when did Skyrim release? Man, that's a loooong time ago.
---
You should file a complaint with the FTC for deceptive practices. It‚Äôs super easy. I did one yesterday and then spent half the day getting flamed by Bethesda enablers.
---
I mean, many questions you asked are in my paragraph, but i can explain again shorter.
---
1. Remember their promises? Ever knew about what they said? Everything is gonna be free. Thats clearly a lie now. Which is false advertising which is a scam. People preordered the game and paid full price, never expecting a monthly subscription. Something like that should be announced, not thrown into the cold water.
---
2. The game got worse by removing survival mode. I had tons of unique and fun memories only possible with this mode, now its gone. 
---
Then i have to learn about the monthly subscription which would make me a second class player, literally. Ppl can just farm exp like crazy while i gotta hope to find ghouls in whitespring.
---
3. Like i said, i played the game my own way, i didnt care much about quests, i only got to the watoga Mission with the satalites. Couldnt find the Last one, it was bugged or something, relogged, had to do the whole Mission over. Nah, too much Stress, i just enjoyed it my way.
---
Do you think they should just swallow their pride and confront the elephant in the room surrounding development funding for this game with their players or should they continue to surprise people with membership dues and $7 refrigerators?
---
Not trying to fight, I‚Äôm genuinely asking.
---
"No one cares about Fallout 76, bye to your now pay 2 win game"?
---
It‚Äôs in the FAQ. And they said yesterday they are adding. So I imagine within the next month or so.
---
this game was a straight cash grab why are you giving them your money for this game.
---
just one "Purge" event ..a short time when everyone can get their evil out, in honor of Halloween :)
---
I‚Äôll stick around this game will only get better with time I‚Äôm chilling let them do what they have to do to make the game succeed.
---
If you‚Äôre not gonna play a game anymore just don‚Äôt play.
---
\+1 for use of fine print.
---
The 2 rare masks (Sun and Winter Man) had a .03% chance dropping, a few did drop, I believe three. The uncommon masks (Skull, Jester and Goblin) the drop chance was bugged to the point that it was all but impossible.
---
Exactly! I'm mostly upset about the unlimited junk storage, and mostly because they've been telling us it's impossible this whole time. I mean I understand that extra server space costs money, but it goes against principle. I'd rather no one have it than only giving it to people willing to spend the money.
---
Why I play: Started a few months ago, still finding new (to me) content, people I play with started late too, and we all got the game plus a collectors box for $14.
---
Then we will still buy it, because you know, we can afford it.
---
Umm. . . Everything they've stated would be free and then went back on their word? At launch they were adamant that Microtransactions would solely be cosmetic. But look where we are now.
---
Denial about? That you hate-baiters are the only thing keeping this game alive? 
---
To use your own arguement against you, xbox does not represent the entire playerbase. And while you were at it, thanks for proving a previous point of mine.
---
Bethesda has a massive following with franchise. Keep talking about it so all those players keep hearing about this game until the wastelanders DLC drops.
---
How much does Bethesda pay you for your loyal service?
---
Then realise your savefile is on Bethesda's computer and you have destroyed exactly nothing.
---
I don't even know what Star Wars TLJ is.  My life doesn't revolve around this shit.
---
Now I think we're getting somewhere here.
---
This stuff really is your whole life.
---
So are we to assume you've seen thier books? 
---
It's a real shame they don't have any other games I didn't realize all they do is FO76.
---
Actually, there's plenty of posts in support. You guys are just persistent enough to spam posts, and a few of you have even made new accounts JUST to make it seem like there's a bigger outrage than there is. That's how small the percentage of people that disapprove is. You guys have to fake numbers just to validate your frustration.
---
Raids run the best they ever have. For reference buttons and doors respond instantly.
---
As for the muling thing already have done so. Just sucks cause I love my mains base so much. Draws the custpmers in lol
---
That fact is what this sub been subject to blind ignorance and fanboyism. Seriously, you brought that up and got shit on by tons of angry people that argued aigainst you no matter how right you were.
---
Idk I‚Äôm a glutton for punishment. Tie me up and do what you will Bethesda!
---
But I don‚Äôt see myself purchasing their Fallout 1st.
---
Plenty of enterprise SaaS is exactly as you have described so your point falls quite flat.
---
N◊ù and yes
---
They come from a nuke waste storage just east of whitesprings.
---
Did you ever get any resolution to this? I bought a new Pro about 2 months ago hoping it would help, but it blue screens 10 times more than the original PS4. The only game on the Pro is Fallout 76. On the evening of October 21st, I crashed 8 times within 2 hours. I don‚Äôt know if I should send the Pro to Sony for warranty repair, or just take my lumps and move to a new game. Over 1800 hours on 76 and lots of friends, it would be really sad if that‚Äôs what it takes.
---
Or just take the easier way and go full mobile since AAA titles don't make no shiet money for them and will make them look bad if they don't deliver 5star experience
---
Hopefully it does.
---
I would love to see the crying and online threats that would come from it.
---
‚Äú***There‚Äôs always going to be new content, changes in game balance,  whatever it takes**z, and by the way, ***it‚Äôs all free after launch*** ‚Äì all our content, there‚Äôs no season pass and no paid DLCs."
---
"And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand--look there's a line. There are people who have crossed it, but ***we're going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works***."
---
  -Pete Hines
---
IMO Camp and the stash should be given to everyone.   They're quality of life improvements and should have been in the base game.  I'm fine with a Subscription for private instance.    Games like Conan Exiles already do this.   As for the exclusive costume: there should be a new one every month like the QuakeCon pack.    I'm not sure how I feel about mods.    I don't think they should be allowed in Adventure mode.   So they're going to end up stuck behind the paywall.   Kinda sucks.   Maybe for the best.   I tend to buy Atoms anyway.    So the price isn't terrible.    Shame the people in Europe have to pay more.
---
This is like Stockholm syndrome, I've never met people who are so eager to be robbed before lmao
---
Except my entire argument revolves around the fact that the hate fest adds far more media attention, social media attention, and damage to their figures and reputation vs. what you‚Äôre suggesting. This sub is a discussion group for the game. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúspeak positively about the game or get banned.‚Äù If you want that, there‚Äôs a fallout76 sub SPECIFICALLY created to knock any criticism that isn‚Äôt just watered down, backhanded nonsense.
---
You bought and paid for and received a game. You also clicked and accepted the TOS which most people do not read and assume. 
---
It‚Äôs a company, no love for it at all, it‚Äôs a business designed to make money plain and simple. Fact is you can play the exact same way if not better today than from day 1... you know what you paid for.
---
I don't know, the fact you make it sound like it is a crime?
---
Thing is, you should pay for a feature that should be in the game you already paid for.
---
Because the prototypical gamer lives in his mom‚Äôs basement, showers once a month and doesn‚Äôt pay for anything. $60 might as well be $6000 or 6 cents. If it‚Äôs not free, that means they have to get up and throw a tantrum until Mom hands over her credit card. If that tactic works upstairs, surely it must work online.
---
*Future of Bethesda
---
I'm 3 hours in and so far The Outer Worlds is a better Fallout game than 76 ever was. It's basically New Vegas in space with a dash of Borderlands thrown in.
---
I highly doubt the decision-makers at Bethesda pay that much mind to the opinions on this sub, lol.
---
i'm still playing
---
not impressed by the changes but that will not deter me from playing, i enjoy it either way. i just deal with what i have
---
You must be the most oblivious person on the internet to not realize how ironic it is to create a post on a video game subreddit and then act like you are too haughty-taughty to know what Star Wars TLJ is XD .
---
Oh man that is gold, thanks for the chuckle
---
Angry Joe: "WHAT IS THIS? BLUE??? F\*CKING BLUE???!!!"
---
You are simply wrong
---
It doesn't seem visual literally deleted  everything and couldn't craft or repair.
---
I don't see them lowering the price given people have already paid the month and yearly price. The backlash of those who paid more would not be good.
---
As far as joining a private server, your friends list will show who is visiting a private server and who is in a private server. Friends can join yours without confirmation, but it is indeed a private world session.
---
This is hilarious if real
---
I am still on the fence about buying the sub in general. If I do, I'll be buying monthly. Unfortunately, I am not confident this game has a year left, at this point. If Wastelanders turns things around, I'd consider the year sub. IMHO
---
Was my main reason for subing to the 1st was for raid clarity. I'm hoping with wastelanders delay we will see vault 96 as a raid to the us over. And if thats the case I'll be prepared for a lagless fun new time.
---
&gt; But, first play session post repair kit fuckery I went to repair an item saw you needed kits
---
You may need to get your eyes tested.  I hope you have good medical insurance.
---
I'm not one to judge how people spend their money. I will say yes you are supporting this behavior, and if you think they've learned a lesson from this think again. Your own words are proof they haven't learned their lesson. They know people will forget and while it may not be ES6, there will be another live service game from Bethesda someday. And it'll likely be shite then too.
---
I replaced the HDD with a SSD as it ended up corrupted from all the crashes. That was my resolution. It has resulted in much less crashes, but fo76 is still the only game on the console that crashes. (except fo4, which I installed and surprisingly crashes LESS even though its modified to all hell)
---
I have plenty of other games on the console as well.
---
Then no one would buy the subscription, just like no one was buying the atoms. That's a terrible idea, and doesn't solve the issue plaguing this game: income.
---
It‚Äôs not visual. It occurs when you force quit whilst loading in to a world and properly deletes everything, I‚Äôve tested. Lost an insane amount a couple hours ago. Pretty crappy of Bethesda. I‚Äôm going to have to force a refund through my bank if they don‚Äôt replace it.
---
I made it sound like what it is. A cashgrab.
---
The intellectual superiority of op is phenomenal, its like some fusion of an atheist neckbeard and blade mastering weeb.
---
They are actually private by intent and should work that way for the most part, but there have been some confirmed reports of random players getting on your private server.  However, those instances are certainly in a minority of cases.   Just passing that along.
---
You're just as greedy if you ain't giving me your stuff. I'm on PC
---
They did, they just stopped it when Bethesda announced to give out the promised bags.
---
Actions are a product of intent. Demand cannot produce action, only provide rationale.
---
You could use your agility points in sneak perks and do some good ranged damage alongside the other perks you've already got.
---
Well if you're on xbox I'll give you're items a good home
---
Except it was NEVER stated private servers would be a free thing, and it's entirely ridiculous to assume that they would be.
---
Watch NPC‚Äôs end up need being paid for too
---
I wasn't robbed, I bought something I thought would be cool
---
Yeah instead of lying about ‚ÄúWood make server die‚Äù. If they just come out and be straight up like we need more funding to pump out content and improve the game in the future people would legit buy that subscription like its candy is obvious the game hasn‚Äôt been making money I mean just look at the Atomic Shop this past few weeks it‚Äôs been depressing and the player base is growing with people finding copies for 15-20$ it‚Äôll keep seeing new players. I genuinely don‚Äôt think Bethesda would do this on purpose to piss people off on purpose desperate times call for desperate measures I guess.
---
&gt; Well the private server let's you claim workshops without pvp like you said. 
---
Only if you unfriend all your friends.
---
I just will never understand people complaining about a game they never played or even watched
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/370339/missing-scrap-in-scrapbox/1
---
Yes but not indefinitely. People argued that it offered buyers an advantage over other players. I said it was still a cosmetic item with a fun, but hardly advantageous, functionality. Now with unlimited junk storage for those willing to pay the price, I see that they are definitely venturing down the pay to win route.
---
Haughty taughty?  What does that even mean?
---
I genuinely don't know what Star Wars TLJ is.  If that makes me "haughty taughty" and gives the Captain a little case of the chuckles, then so be it.
---
Put in a ticket for it then. They said they are looking into replacing the lost items.
---
Clicks and views, adsense is all people are worried about. They will just reinstall the game and carry on as before.
---
Delete your character in case you forget.
---
This is awful I have 57 pteros and 86 quetz ev trained for speed and studio wildcard bungie activision just gonna take that away from me im never playing this game again i want my money back change it back now
---
Very cool! I can‚Äôt believe I missed this yesterday.
---
SO BRAVE. go join the protestors in Hong Kong bruh
---
Have not had it destroyed, but it does get attacked and is a magnet for area mobs.
---
Why is it ridiculous? It's something so basic
---
You have no love for Bethesda? Truly?
---
Take a break and come back once wastelanders is out.
---
I was really hoping he'd be interested in discussing something else, but maybe he ended up subscribing ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Wait...there's scrap in ESO? Wow...ugh...that's....pretty lame.
---
Safe travels
---
Fair enough. Sorry for calling it nonsensical then.
---
Bethesda just straight up spit in the face of the community and are trying to make you pay 100$-150$ a year for content that doesn't even work right. 
---
How they have fallen
---
Any other mmo game makes you pay for a private server.
---
Yeah, he and talked about the timing of the post and how it would get lost in the sea of posts from the patch notes. Probably should have waited some more, but glad it helps you.
---
Inability makes it sound like they want to but can't. This is a calculated disregard. The loyal fans are simply not important anymore. The money comes from new monetisation systems now, not making a good game. The relationship has shifted from symbiotic to parasitic across the entire AAA industry.
---
Once an industry get's big enough there comes a point where the accountants start making all the decisions. That goes double for anything publicly traded.
---
Y should anyone delete their character,  that's like throwing away all the time they spend on this game. U honestly dont appreciate the value of time and money.
---
I think that‚Äôs a solid idea. But again if I have to pay a subscription to get special quality of life and utility items, I probably won‚Äôt come back.
---
I mean look at that guy who's book you just bought. There's no way that he, his publisher, his distributor and the bookshop can make money on the book as it stands. There's absolutely no way that the $20 you paid for that book can be shared amongst that many people.
---
Whilst it had a good start, I see no problem that the plotlines are going nowhere and the premise is lacking. That will come over time as more people read the book and get engaged with it. There's absolutely no problem with publishing something that isn't finished and seeing if people will be willing top buy more if it proves popular.
---
Frankly, as an author, I'm offended that people would expect me to published something that was finished because otherwise I would have wasted a lot of effort in case it was a dud. I don't see what the big issue is. They paid their $20 for a book, but I can't understand how they could have expected a finished book.
---
Ah yeah that makes sense(as far as any of this makes sense)possibly even pay for higher buffs on companions so stock ones weedy as all hell but you can pay the enclave to mess with them.
---
Haha here's at least one upvote for you and I'm sorry I doubted you.
---
I cooked their books myself my man. But no, I think this is 'indicative' of other problems.
---
Fingers crossed that Wastelanders is not like The Burrows.....
---
Maybe that is why they pushed it back.........lol........
---
Maybe it just needs a wall
---
I'm not a native English speaker and learning what "snake oil salesmen" means from this, made me sad. I used to love Bethesda and Fallouts.

Kek.
---
Silly me. I forgot how all knowing and powerful the reddit subs are /s
---
Bethesda said they weren't gonna do this shit when they released the game. It's a bait and switch scam, not first class vs coach.
---
It‚Äôs for fallout 4

For PC and Xbox: https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/9034 (with the new update coming soon)
---
For PC (Xbox one in the works): https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/40136
---
The first one has a few more creative liberties and is customisable
---
The second one is more accurate to New Vegas
---
It would be another ticket on top of who know how many. Junk is easy to find, I'm more in shock how they sell a service and part of it deletes the junk you store.  It really is unbelievable that they didn't test it.
---
It‚Äôs a game, they provide entertainment... I paid them not only for the game but the subscription as well and getting exactly what I paid for. 
---
I don‚Äôt expect anything else and if I get something it‚Äôs a bonus.
---
They don't give a fuck lol I mean really, does it feel like they've respected their player base at all since launch?
---
I understand where you're coming from and in normal circumstances I would agree that my statement doesn't really hold water. In this instance though the data they're pointing at is very clearly a result of them loading gameplay effecting items unto the store front and then acting surprised and attributing the sales numbers to player preference while knowing that gameplay effecting items and services in a multiplayer game with even a hint of a competitive nature(not to mention the outright PVP in this instance) are *going* to sell and that doesn't have dick diddly to do with what players want. Players want a fair and balanced game and they're willing to pay for that(Some will even pay full price for a broken/buggy 80% asset flip), but unfortunately you can also get *more* money by placing game breaking items up for sale to tempt the tired, bored, and lazy gamers as well as the trolls and the whales.
---
Not really. The difference is, despite being Enterprise SaaS, it‚Äôs actually quality software that is most times worth the cost. So no, my point does not fall flat.
---
I like the fact that it feels it lets you do almost anything. First time I saw Ernest I had my pistol drawn. I‚Äôm sure you know where it went from there. Didn‚Äôt even talk to the guy
---
&gt; Would you buy a more expensive and subscription based version of Photoshop that crashes consistently
---
This is the absolute worst example you could have possibly given. Most people with legitimate copies of Photoshop use CC, and it's very well known for having a lot of stability issues.
---
I agree. People are talking like it's a good thing they have to sub for the game to work properly.
---
How hard is it to add more quests and enemies?
---
For me it's not the private servers but the unlimited junk storage and 2nd base.
---
Me too man. We made a gamble as we do with any purchase, and we thought it would be a good gamble due to our previous gambles with their games. This one turned out not to be so good.
---
What friends
---
So go play the game and stop complaining you have to see people who disagree with you. As my old man used to say, the world doesn‚Äôt revolve around you.
---
This is so stupid but It made me laugh, thanks.
---
Yeah I find when its a single player game its a bit more positive. Mass Effect one is pretty positive as well except for the constant Andromeda is garbage/Andromeda is the best arguments which never end
---
Exactly! When I see them deleting their characters I‚Äôll believe them... that‚Äôs not happening... 
---
If they do delete them... I‚Äôll thank them for making the game better!
---
Exactly.
---
He just said he can get it for 17.  And you dont need to pay for firs
---
Makes complete sense mate I respect it.
---
The Sun Kissed perk in Endurance removes rads during daylight.
---
Its not a good game. Its a terrible game that has some decent chunks of story. The gameplay is abyssmal.
---
SCRAPBOX
---
Right! I chose the xp again from companion kills lol. Figured early on any extra xp I can gain will be good lol
---
No, at this point they haven‚Äôt added anything new I care about since the spring dlc. All the summer dlc aimed at multiplayer and the raid stuff I‚Äôm not interested in. I‚Äôve been playing mostly to get my daily atoms which I‚Äôve noticed I can get much less now unless I want to play the raids (and because what they did to events ones that rely on events rely on me playing long enough to be lucky for one to spawn). This move was the excuse I needed to put down what felt like a chore. Maybe I‚Äôll come back if they actually put out wastelanders. But 2020 brings cyberpunk and I‚Äôm also waiting for outer worlds on switch so maybe that too. So I may just be too invested in other games by then.
---
To your question; you really sound like an idiot.
---
Because they are financially crippled, obvi.
---
Most of them play the game, you can assume whatever you‚Äôd like about the people who are upset, but that doesn‚Äôt change or justify the truth of Bethesda‚Äôs actions
---
There is no 76 mods, The mod the comment was about the fallout 4 mods
---
The only way this should be in game is if you cant place your camp and you want to stay with friends. Not as an extra placement.
---
Exactly. Just some code war. From the players perspective. We wouldn‚Äôt give a damn
---
How the fuck is referendum ignoring the result? You are literally arguing that asking the people isn't democracy. 
---
What are you even smoking. 
---
The first vote was tainted with political misinformation and I don't think it's wrong to ask a question again. 
---
Especially a question that is held in such high importance.
---
Nice the way you completed ignored everything I said and focused on the brexit point. Really speaks volumes about youre type
---
Why do you care, just go do something you enjoy?
---
Some said they uninstalled it... they‚Äôll be back... they always come back... 
---
I totally appreciate time and money! I have plenty of time and plenty of money thanks to a great budget my parents taught me long ago. 
---
It‚Äôs entertainment... simple as that.
---
let the butthurt flow through you
---
This is true, longtime Fallout fan that drops in on the sub during times like these here to usually stir up some hate on these subjects.
---
This needs to be dialed down, the top posts are all hate filled, just go to those and show solidarity or something.  I know a fair few people on here don't have a continuous comment history here that starts earlier than the Fallout 1st fiasco, me included on that.
---
I‚Äôm super stoked about this event! I wonder if it‚Äôs going to be an hourly thing or what. And I wonder what the rewards for NW are going to be as well. It‚Äôs actually a pretty big list of things to acquire in only a week. It‚Äôs going to take some serious grinding to get all that stuff. I can‚Äôt believe they are giving away the ws jumpsuit!!! It‚Äôs going to kill that value just like the vtu jacket, maybe not quite that bad but still pretty bad.
---
Okay, Todd. Keep your head deep in the sand.
---
Exactly my very same opinion. Originally I thought that the tent and scrap box combo was too game changing but its really just the box.
---
The outfit, and even the second camp, go a bit above what I'd consider 'base game'.  I'm on the fence about the tent, but exclusive outfits aren't really an issue (as much as people may want to be completionists and collectors, things like that are often tied to subscriptions).  Neither of them have that much of an effect on people's gameplay.
---
The private games (not servers, that's another distinction), and the bonus atoms are perfectly OK as special features (IMO).
---
The unlimited scrap is a big issue, in that they are locking an important (or at least a significant gameplay) change behind the paywall, after they said that it couldn't be done due to server limitations.  You can put the tent in that category too, if you feel strongly about it, but to me it's a minor thing.  If one, or both, of these things wasn't part of the subscription, I would have no issues with the whole situation.
---
One month and I get the costume and store all my junk one time. Worth it for sure. Plus 1600 atoms so I could get more shit. Worth it for me no need to be an asshole to people that enjoy it.
---
Same post every five minutes
---
I really enjoyed Vampyr.  Combat was a little stiff but I liked the story.  Really great atmosphere to the game as well.
---
I agree that investors are most likely the main reason for doing this. But at some point, pissing off your entire fan base to the point at which they don‚Äôt even want to play your games anymore will hurt your profits more than help.
---
Yes i did it until the nuke went away got many 3*
---
You can't ask the pebbles why they're in the avalanche.  They don't know.
---
Well, theres the workaround for not having new people come through to cause a respawn.  Thx!
---
I‚Äôm fine with the game. It‚Äôs the sub I‚Äôm fed up with. I‚Äôm astonished that some members have survived to adulthood.
---
Wait, you have a fallout tattoo yet you‚Äôre not interested in future content? Elaborate
---
Has it been confirmed that the travel tent blocks the standard CAMP area? That is definitely an issue then and one BGS should rectify. I can foresee a future real soon where Whitespring is even more "camped" out then it is today. Particular if these tents are like foundations and don't take damage.
---
They get paid everything time they go through work, it's called a wage or salary.
---
Bethesda isn't some indie game barely scraping by they make thousands every hour.
---
Did the same today.. then went out and brought the outer worlds. And I‚Äôm loving it.
---
Of course the goal is to be disruptive to the core community. The core community buys the shit product, the disruption lessens those sales. Absolutely NOBODY should be buying this; people cannot complain about the horrid state of micro transactions, egregious behavior, and price gouging of gaming companies (EA, Blizzard, etc) then hopping right on board with Bethesda‚Äôs version.
---
Might just be my personality, but I LOVE seeing the hate get plastered everywhere, because extreme anti-consumer cash grabs need to be met with equivalently extreme consumer backlash, or else nothing gets done. Peacefully dissenting with a few posts does nothing. The media would not pick the story up nearly as much unless people were downright outraged. Since this is so egregious, it needs just as egregious as a reaction.
---
Again, there is a FO76 sub for all those loyal dudes who only want to hear nice things about the company selling them what should be free content for $12.99 a month. If anyone wants to go there, have at it. That‚Äôs what the sun‚Äôs made for.
---
I'm not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, because this sub it so full of uneducated nonsense right now... I'll just assume the worst and then say: That's a real stretch of a comparison which fails immediately when you consider Beth has 14 patches, most with .5 patches, released several new events, and items, etc. And while I agree, it's been a buggy road, it's far from what you are implying. Not to mention if you buy digital books, they do often get updates, though those are usually grammar and punctuation.
---
That doesn‚Äôt change that what Bethesda has done is morally wrong and unloyal to its player base
---
You managed to get into the beta game? Lucky I tried and I remember it was down twice
---
But just a list of text when accessing a bag like everything else, shame we can't drop the actual item model on the ground.
---
Oh I did have to claim it first. For me after I bought it I had to go to the 1st menu in the atom shop to find it and the emotes and stuff. Then it popped up in the crafting station.
---
The slippery slope argument really only applies to money. All other situations are morality ethics based but money and business.... Don't have ethics.
---
Yeah, but why? They lied to us about the storage limit so it means that they basically made this limiting (and un-fun) game mechanic so as to get us to pay them more money?
---
If that's the case then yeah, I guess you are right, the two are the same. They're both subpar versions of their single-player versions and they make you pay for basic features that you shouldn't.
---
Nothing personal man, and if you like it you like it, but come on...adding a subscription is insane.
---
Thanks for the suggestion. That doesn't mean I'm not entitled to complain about a series that I used to hold in high regard and a game I spent full price on.
---
I don‚Äôt care if anyone disagrees with me, I don‚Äôt even downvote others that have different opinions. 
---
My point is that the subreddits thread is full of the exact same content and complaints many form new accounts or fake ones and many that have uninstalled the game per their own comments. 
---
So my original post stands...
---
The arches act like Rad Away and will remove your mutations. The Starched Geenes perk, when maxed, essentially locks your mutation list as is...none will be removed or added, regardless of what you are exposed to. So, none will be removed by arches or meds...and none will be added by being exposed to radiation. Serums will still work, though...if you want to add others.
---
Hope that makes sense now. I just got up and am still caffeinating.
---
I just don't tend to like games where some people can pay to have advantages over others, and I think that's where this game is heading.
---
See, the thing is I used to enjoy Fallout 76 until I realized that all our suggestions were being turned into shameless cashgrabs.
---
Have fun in your not private worlds that you paid for and the stash that'll just eat your stash. It was a bait and switch.
---
I feel like you're stuck in 2018 :(
---
No you said x is more than y and I said that's wrong and it is
---
Almost people form opinions through other people instead of wasting money on a product they wont use after an hour
---
How tf is it a great ideaüòë
---
Shit! I forgot about that one. Hmmmm, I might have to try that. Would it make leveling faster, but how much faster do you think?
---
Sweet thanks I‚Äôm going to go farm some
---
What?!
---
Both are great games, can't go wrong with either!
---
I appreciate your honesty and upvoted you, I don‚Äôt agree with the model but I am liking the real conversations and insight I‚Äôm getting rather than a lot of people‚Äôs low effort and antagonistic posts as to why they do or do not support this.
---
If they were having issues with justifying further development costs, they should come out and address it and I think a lot more people would be less hostile over this. People would still be hostile but not as hostile as a pack of 6 super mutants preparing to have you for lunch. The lack of communication on their overall situation besides dropping bombs like this, is rather frustrating and seeing how they have a whole PR team, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to avoid saying something about the struggles all together. I feel as though the ‚Äúif you build it, they will come‚Äù mentality they have will only work for so long UNTIL they come out of hiding and talk to people. We don‚Äôt know what else they have in their hat, so it‚Äôs kind of wondering what else could go wrong but also wondering what they could do better.
---
Morally wrong??? How‚Äôs is that?
---
= ADDITIONAL INFO THAT HAS TO BE STORED ON AND LOADED FROM THEIR SERVERS.
---
Did you lose your junk? I subbed to just get all the rewards for this month so I went ahead and moved all my junk to the scrap box but after hearing about everyone losing their junk after going to a private server so I‚Äôm scared to jump into one.
---
And my point is whether you want those posts there or not is irrelevant and thus so is your post.
---
can people server hop or is invite/friends only,even if its only 1 person out of 8 i would say that is more than they make selling that one armor they would also still be selling it
---
This saddens me to say, but at this point is seriously doubt I'll be getting the next Elder Scrolls. Jeeez.
---
Then don't put a ticket in...
---
And while I am not defending the subscription thing, this "Why didn't they test it?" for every little issue is really fucking stupid. They did test it, and it is entirely possible they never once had an issue. They only have a QA team of a few people, and many times, some issues don't get found till the thousands of players actually get their hands on it.
---
I mean honestly, how long do you expect someone to sit there testing this one single feature? If they do it a dozen times each, and it works fine each time, then why would they not think it works fine?
---
And yes, the game does have some glaring issues that indeed probably should have been seen early on, but it seems like every single little issue that pops up, SOMEONE is saying "Why didn't they test it?"...
---
Yes, it will be an hourly event. 
---
Here are the Nuclear Winter rewards brought to you courtesy of u/SageAZ:

I had the same thoughts about the jumpsuit.

Np it was the first thing i tested
---
No and that's the issue I have to pay 100 dollars for what should be the next new update.
---
This is pure "Tin Foil Hat" speculation Zenimax is worth is 2.5 Billion. That's a fuck ton of Zeros. They can afford to bomb a game or two. 
---
And before you say but that's Zenimax not Bethesda you should know
---
&gt;In 1999,¬†Bethesda¬†Softworks was acquired by ZeniMax Media Inc., a company founded by¬†Bethesda¬†Softworks founder, Christopher Weaver and current ZeniMax Media Inc. CEO, Robert A. Altman
---
It's basically all the same Zenimax's largest titles are produced by Bethesda. Though I honestly can't figure out what other studios they own. If someone else knows I'd love to find out.
---
Awesome. Yeah I played a few hrs last night. Is it a longer story would you say?
---
Yep, Providence Equity Partners. They want their returns or else.
---
Oh ok. Like a GoFundMe or something? Wild, cant imagine having that kind of disposable income.
---
No crashes or disconnects? Are you saying the private world runs better?
---
Not sure lol but going to find out tonight.  Lol already warned my fo76 buddies I would be MIA until I finished my first playthrough of Worlds lol
---
sounds like power-levelling is BACK on the menu boys.
---
No i didnt lose it yet you might want to keep it in the stash for a while
---
The ability to repair all your guns without materials so you can fight longer
---
The ability to fix your weight limit with scrap kits so you're never overemcumbered
---
So if we where in PVP you'd have the advantage of indestructible weapons and teleportation for your junk items.
---
"Can you play the game exactly how I bought it?"
---
Yes but when I bought it I was promised more stash space and less restrictions over time. They've just locked off the stash space behind a pay wall despite telling me to hang in there.
---
How long will you be in denial?
---
Or they are in their private server
---
Slight bioluminescent moss in a cave.
---
Not as crazy as fools like you that still play this game.
---
Nothing personal here either. I‚Äôm an adult and can handle others opinions, that‚Äôs how we grow.

ESO is the same model and I said it here 200+ days ago here: they called me crazy

---
So the real question is now do they plan to actually do anything about it or is this one of those scenarios where they say oops sorry nothing we can do good luck
---
Dont know why you're getting down voted da faq.
---
Oh so you think 10k+ people that were online on this subreddit are real players? Yeah I really wish fo76 playerbase was actually twice the size of dota2's
---
So they were being a twat with the stupid "If you want X, go play Y instead" argument... Got it.
---
And yes there are mods for 76. Primarily visual mods.
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76
---
You can brigade the new p2w scheme all day but a single word of dissent and its a 30day ban. Bethesda is that you?
---
I mean it's not exactly what I thought but it's close enough for me to not regret it
---
It was buggy for me as well - 2 steps forward and one step back, so I had to redo steps I had already done....I think I finished it around L125.
---
unfixed bug issue aside, if you already have black diamond, at your level, other than the XP for completing the quest, the final reward is not worth the time.
---
Then you didn't play this game... Makes ET for Atari looks like a masterpiece.
---
Then replace Photoshop with any other SaaS subscription plan. I do know that Photoshop CC does not have the disastrous quality and bug issues as FO76, especially when you think of Joseph Anderson‚Äôs video on the 1,001 bugs of FO76.
---
Played with a buddy last night, loved his private server, I farmed fusion cores while he did his thing, it was nice .. I am tempted ..
---
But looking at the server I can't imagine the developers did much to create them, there is no indication you are actually on a private server what so ever .. nothing on the map, nothing next to my name, zip, zero, nada. So I admit I don't know what they did, but as far as I can tell, all they did was assign a standard public server to a player. Idk about development, but I highly doubt much development time was put into making private servers at all. Maybe put some basic controls. I was unable to join a friend on the same server, you have to join the host and be friends with the host .. outside of the it feels like a public server with no players, that's all. Is it worth $12 of peace, I am not sure, but it was nice not worrying about my workshop .. I didn't get any other benefits like the tent and stash, so maybe all of that is worth it.
---
Someone educate me .. 
---
I agree, no one should be mad about people wanting private servers or having to pay. If you don't like it, don't pay it's that simple. If you don't want to support them, speak with your wallet and let those that want to speak with their's .. it's a democracy not a dictatorship folks ..
---
&gt; Yes, but I have proof that the title was a perfect clickbait title 
---
You do know that Reddit hasn't monetized post clicks?
---
Sounds good, Community Manager Tetrinox!
---
exactly!
---
And companion pets... pay for Dogmeat!
---
There is no reason that the survival tent should remain a 1st subscription only offering. It could be an Atom Shop item whenever BGS decides to do so. The only unique thing about the 1st subscription is the "private" server capability. That is a new game mode and tied to an account. Everything else is an Atom Shop goodie.
---
I had to make a new charachter and delete that one beat the game again and realised it was not worth it and uninstalled.
---
You can‚Äôt quit a game and not have a break up letter. Cmon man.
---
The funny thing is , they picked the worst possible time to do it. Outer worlds is officially released and they just postponed wastlelanders. It‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre trying to kill the game on purpose
---
I used to. My PA set up was X-01 for the top end, with T-60 legs at the bottom. Then I made X-01 Calibrated Shocks legs.
---
First you have to claim it from the atomic store, is it not still being heavily promoted and shoved in everyones face on the front of the store?
---
Then go to an armor bench and craft it under ‚Äòoutfits‚Äô.
---
I rallied so hard for this game.  I took the cheap shots, the insults, the teasing....all of it, and stood there and defended it.  Hoped and prayed with each update that the game would keep getting a little better and a little more FO universe.  I realized and accepted this was more or less an "offshoot" of a traditional FO title, and honestly, in the beginning, I really did genuinely enjoy myself with this game.  
---
Then came the end (or lack thereof?) game.  So, I focused on building camp, crafting, selling, etc.  That was ok for a while and right when I was beginning to get bored with no more quests and nothing to do except what I mentioned above, they announce Wastelanders.  Finally!  FO traditional is going to merge with FO76!  This is going to be incredible!
---
Then, it was delayed.  Slightly disappointed but understood, nonetheless.  Now, this shit.  And I have to tell you, after all the "updates" and all the "NEW EVENTS!" and promises of this or that---I'm no longer looking forward to WL'ers.  If any of you think, after all that Beth has done, and what it's currently doing, that WL is going to just magically flip this game upside down and it'll become awesome, you are exactly who this company is pandering to.  You're exactly who they want playing.  Yeah, you keep hanging in there, kiddo, things will turn around any day now....
---
I said before in a comment a few months ago, that WL was going to be what makes or breaks this game.  If they screw that up, it's done.  Looks like they beat me to it without even having to add in WL.  WL will be a major fail and will be the bare, BARE minimum they can get away with and call it content.  I swear this to you, mark my post so in Q1 2020, you can see that I called this.  There is no way, no possible way, with the trend Beth is on (and has been, frankly) that they're going to knock it out of the park with WL.  It will be, just like all the others, a huge let-down, disappointment of an added content, and it's sad.  It's a shame.  I, like most of all of you, know what this game could be.  What it could've been.  All it would've taken was some effort on Beth's part.  And it wasn't done, or, if it was, it was with the most minimal effort.  I hate that I have to write that.  I hate that I feel the way I do about this.  I LOVE FO.  I'm replaying 3 as of now and it's a damn masterpiece.  FO4, and FNV, while different in their own rights, were also amazingly immersive and fun.  This?  Not so much.  Actually, looking back, not at all really.  
---
I guess we should thank them.  For letting us see that at no point was there any intent to add love to the lore and wonder of FO.  It was, and is, and always will be, a shameless money-grab.  They never intended to come with a new, unique take of FO with this game.  They gave us the bare minimum and ran to the bank.  WL is not going to be what you all (and me) hope it will be.  Their track record up to now proves it.  It will be a bug-riddled, probably premium pay content, and it will disappoint.
---
And it's a shame.
---
Who cares
---
Travel camps should simply be auto-bumped by an incoming Main camp of another player.  Can't do that to another players Main camp because of the effort sometimes put into building it.  But the Travel camp?  It just plops down, that's it.  So bump those tiny sumbitches out of the way.  Problem solved.
---
Interesting. Maybe you should share your logic with Tim:-

---
Maybe it Will be like Vault Raids and silo runs: free but doesn't work well unless you choose to play it with the resources of private servers.
---
Mothafuckas removed Survival to cash for those servers.
---
Wow. You defend a stash that delayed stash with an essay. I give up.
---
The obvious should be obvious. I‚Äôve played the game since launch and I‚Äôm still playing it now. Bethesda are trying to scrape your money for something that just isn‚Äôt worth it. 13$ a month is a ludicrous ransom for things that players have been asking for/about before the game even launched. In the case of the scrapbox specifically, they‚Äôre withholding something that was promised before launch, unlimited storage space, and after having told us it wasn‚Äôt possible, it turns out that it‚Äôs totally possible but now we have to pay extra for what should be and was promised as a base feature of the game. Everything else given in that bundle isn‚Äôt worth what you‚Äôre paying for in anyway. On top of all that, Bethesda can‚Äôt even be asked to put into the game correctly! It‚Äôs an attempt to further monetize their dedicated player base whore gonna stick with it to make up for the fact that not as many people bought it or continue to play it as they would like. I‚Äôve loved Bethesda for a long time but this is inexcusable when the game still has a myriad of problems and known bugs and glitches.
---
I moved all my flux back to my stash as soon as I read it! It‚Äôs such a potential to stack absurd amounts of valuable junk! I hope they fix it soon because I‚Äôm going to go to workshops and collect all the resources with no worries of having to fuck with PVP or anything like that.
---
How about playing games that dont treat their users like cattle aka stop playing AAA releases :)
---
Where do you think the money for that wage or salary comes from. 
---
Companies dont produce money, they make it by charging for services and goods.  That money then gets used to pay for company infrastructure, and the salary of the employees.
---
&gt;I've never seen a company shoot themselves in the foot as badly as this.
---
That suggests you didn't buy Anthem.
---
I thought you had to pay for wastelanders etc?
---
Yeah they are whale , but we need them :) 
---
I personally started at 45 and upgraded (10$ per 10$) to 150 $ ^^ it's a slippery road
---
yes let us not just blame the company for treating people like hot garbage its the consumers fault.
---
Why you say option #4 is impossible. A single game doesn't decides how a company will work for years to come. Instead I think that option #4 is the most possible option, and because this is the internet. All of this is my opinion.
---
I've played for 300+ hours and rarely run into bugs...
---
What the fuck are you talking about. This sub is full of fanatical people that defend everything bethesda does and up to two days ago would rabidly downvote anything negative about the game. It seems to me like you are new here. Mixing it up with the main fallout sub?
---
Imagine seeing a coffee maker vastly over priced, in your opinion, at Walmart and feeling compelled to go home and write multiple pages of vitriolic, rage fueled madness directed at the manufacturer of the coffee maker and every person who has purchased that specific coffee maker.

"You're the reason coffee making futures are blah blah blah! Reeeeeeeeee!"
---
It's amazing.
---
Yeah i dont really care about it mu camp budget is full and Flux is not really a problem for me
---
When a child throws a tantrum, the worst thing to do is reward that behavior with attention.
---
Bethesda is behaving like a parent stuck with a spoiled little brat. The most responsible thing to do is go away, let the little piece of shit calm down and hope to start a reasonable discussion after they come to their senses.
---
Literally the first moment I got out of the vault all of the little spider bot things were invisible and I couldnt kill them unless I used VATS
---
I know what Pete said, and it was pretty obvious that they meant the content packs, not this shit
---
A Car can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to tens of thousands of dollars. A car that doesn‚Äôt work properly when bought and has number of undisclosed issues can kill the driver or someone else on the road. 
---
A video game costs between 60-120 depending on the version bought and poses no threat to people‚Äôs health and safety if they don‚Äôt function properly or have undisclosed issues.
---
Lemon laws exist for products that would be legitimately unsafe for those using them and those around them. They don‚Äôt exist for people who bought a video game which ended up becoming a barely functioning cash grab. The law you would want for games would fall under the FTC‚Äôs/FCC‚Äôs jurisdiction, particularly regarding fraud and false advertising. And these laws already exist, someone or multiple people would just has to file a complaint with those organizations first to get the ball rolling.
---
‚ÄúEntitled to complain‚Äù
---
Is the most millennial thing I‚Äôve ever heard. 
---
Sure ok complain... for a response see my post title.
---
Yea if I lose some steel or bone or even lead it won‚Äôt be the end of the world but 200 lbs of flux would piss me off quite a bit!
---
I completely understand that. But it‚Äôs not just the usual posts about fun and silly stuff. It‚Äôs just an echo chamber of fools singing Bethesda‚Äôs praises. It is fucking insane.
---
The DLC is free. 
---
The Membership for premium benefits is not.
---
So you're telling me Bethesda making ppl pay 100$ a year for a subscription to unlock stuff that was said to be free and not even having half the shit working doesnt warrant people shit talking a shitty game made by a shitty company doing everything in their to make their game relevant. Rage 2 was hyped. Crashed and burned. Same with new Wolfenstein. Doom eternal is their next big game which may make or break the company's rep. Next elder scrolls is at least 2 years away from release. Imagine how people will feel about that since all there games beforehand have been shitty games that are broken beyond belief.
---
Dude if you want stuff in this world you gotta pay, stop whining.
---
What's this with the fridge did they just put the plans in the atom shop
---
Or else...

This sub has kept you playing?Are you from the Upside Down?
---
I just find it confusing that this is the line that had to be crossed for you people to see how terrible of a company they are.
---
What world are you living in? Those so called "fans" were the reason that bethesda got so bold to implement something like this in this sad excuse of a game.
---
Again i think at least to large majority of the sane playerbase it has been clear from the get go what this was. 
---
Bethesda doesnt care about your opinion. They never did. Wake me mate.
---
Cant believe this  still has to be made clear to people
---
There is nothing wrong with profiting off of a product. There is a problem with making a product that doesnt resemble the product that was promised, and doesnt work they way it was intended to then going back on a promise (nothing except cosmetic in game monetizing) that was a selling point of the product which then gets arbitrarily dismissed and the pricetag tacked on is orders of magnitude higher than ftp games with similar models. I get that youre some jaded libertarian or whatever, but there are rules and regulations set up to protect consumers, but are not updated to cover digital monetizing and these companies are taking advantage of their consumers in response. Enjoy defending the ppl. Who view you as a walking wallet.
---
Bought it and half the items say to find the plans for so like wth
---
You‚Äôre hallucinating if you think this is DLC.
---
This is totally what I would do but on principle I don't want to pay more than the original $60, especially when they said all future content would be free or cost Atoms. I'm not knocking others for getting the subscription.
---
One of the things none of us know is how much people are spending in the atom shop and what they are buying.  Minorities and majorities can seem equally vocal online.  A psychological study was done a long time ago which determined that if you like something you may tel an average of 1-3 people but if you dislike something you will tel an average of 7-9.  So opposition can certainly punch above its weight.  Anyway, if a ton of people are spending a certain amount in the atom shop per month, they would have used those figures to create a $100 annual game pass.   That‚Äôs about $8.33/month.  1100 atoms are about $9.  So for $8.33 you get more atoms per month and all these other services.  Everyone paying more than $8.33 to get atoms each month will find this to be a deal, and everyone else not.  I am just willing to bet that the majority of gamers who have played this game this long still have spent $8.33/month on average in the atom shop.  Maybe just a simple majority, but the math makes perfect sense depending on the data we just don‚Äôt have available to us.
---
be careful not cutting yourself on that edge buddy! ;)
---
Holy fuck...well shit man. Yeah, you called it.
---
No, not at all. There's just an optional subscription now that gives you unlimited crafting storage, a mini camp, and a free outfit. Oh, and 1650 atoms. Some nice stuff to have to be sure, but nothing game breaking or p2w like everyone complains about.
---
Yes telling your consumers you can't do something over a server limitation and then selling that something isn't fucking shady at all.
---
So because they put private worlds behind a hundred dollar subscription instead of a flat paywall that makes it different?
---
Yeah idk why ya'll are arguing this. This sub is considered to be fanatical about the game. People used to defend bethesda and fo76 to the death here and downvote anything negative, no matter if true or not. I would call it brainwashed rather than beacon of positivity but I can see how someone would not voluntarily call himself that so he tried to give that behavior a positive spin.
---
Why, thank you!
---
According to some people that may not be even the case. Some are saying you can stay in private worlds even if the host has left and they don‚Äôt have  the service.
---
I asked bc you don't even play the game.
---
What is it?
---
All DLC has been and will continue to be free to everyone though
---
I don‚Äôt use it have used scrap or repair kits. 
---
PvP is broke and duping overall of god-rolled armor and weapons ruined survival thanks to players doing it.
---
Stash originally was 400... then 600 and now 800... they literally doubled the space. 
---
Subscription isn‚Äôt needed and if you think it‚Äôs being used for an advantage in PvP that‚Äôs just an excuse... like I said PvP is broken and the majority are just griefing other players... sorry but the sniper stealth build is a joke and not PvP... killing a player way lower is just trolling and weak.
---
Yea tell me about it, why would i want to give my money to bethesda...On a happier note outer worlds is fantastic if you havent tried it yet.
---
The problem is, for every one person loudly crying foul, there's at least one other who doesn't say anything, doesn't care at all, and just pays for whatever's being offered to them. If that wasn't the case, we wouldn't be where we are now, because it wouldn't be worth it for the devs to prepare and push out these "features". It doesn't work that way. It also doesn't work if people are grumbling here or anywhere else - but then ingame they silently bought the repair kits, the scrap kits, the fridge and the junk collector, just because they could (whether with purchased or earned atoms is irrelevant). Saying a bunch of words doesn't mean jack if on the other side they keep seeing enough profit that justify ventures like this subscription model.
---
And I'm curious how many will actually buy into it. The official forum already has a number of threads about it, and they're not all full of outrage either.
---
Don't pretend to be an idiot, it's literally impossible for someone with access to the internet and other people not to of at least heard some mention of the star wars sequels. You want me to believe you are the only person on the internet who hasn't heard of STAR WARS the last jedi, next you'll tell me you don't know who Mario is, or what SpongeBob is.
---
What is it? I feel like we're splitting hairs here.
---
What a fucking legend. I can‚Äôt believe Bethesda shat this game out and it survived this long. I‚Äôm so glad I never bought 76. I hope the loyal fans now see Bethesda‚Äôs true colors. They don‚Äôt deserve your money.
---
Non-player? I have been playing since release. Tens of characters, exactly 1060 hours playing. I stopped playing after testing a friend's private server, where silo runs and cores are not a problem, there's no lag, shotguns work well and the game does not malfunction. I like the game, played every day. Played more than most people. In fact, it's the only game I had been playing since last year: disc never left the console. 
---
So, please, enlighten me. Tell me how it is Ok to need to pay extra for the game to work.
---
Yeah, I'm curious if there is anything like mob grinding in TOW. I don't think it's a crucial part of the leveling process, but I am playing on Harde Mode so I kinda want to level as much as I can and as quickly as I can.
---
Bethesda love people like you. The type who say, "Ah, who cares, its only $12 a month!" You're paying a fortune extra (more than the game itself if you're subscribed for a few months) for utter garbage.
---
Exactly! Now you guys are getting my click bait title.
---
What this guy said .
---
Where on Earth did this game cost $80? We‚Äôre talking about USD, right?
---
agree with the last sentence 
---
it reminds me of runescape's membership, because of all the 'advantages', except with fallout 76 you have to pay to play as well
---
Since you're leaving, can I call you dad?
---
&gt;How the fuck is second referendum ignoring the result?
---
What? You really don't get it do you.
---
Bethesda claimed they had to limit storage space because of "Server Instability" then proceeds to say they will give you unlimited junk storage for a monthly fee...and before you try to claim it's ok because you are on your own server you need to remember, you can access it in regular servers too
---
Right behind you guys
---
Is the fridge not DLC?  Or the scrap bot?  Or the unlimited scrap chest????  Or the tent?.....
---
Prevents food from spoiling which is only obtained through the atom shop. Sucks because there is no other way to prevent food spoilage simply just ways to slow it down. Just another greedy quality of life mechanic locked behind a paywall.
---
&gt;"Of course the goal is to be disruptive to the core community. The core community buys the shit product,"
---
Sure, but 76 has been a loss all around for BS &amp; Zenimax.  Just because they lied through their teeth doesn't mean we need to one up their egregious behavior by jumping in like band of sun-dried dog turds and purposefully try to make this a "fun free zone" for the few players who are actually still trying to get their money's worth of the product.
---
Definitely your personality,  I used to love to do that too, but the thing is we aren't the consumers of 76, and it's being met with backlash.  Seriously if you want them to do something then go to the "Hot" posts and upvote any that are voicing displeasure towards the product, then drop a comment on them saying you agree.  There's no reason to try and blot out the community feed with this rubbish.
---
Seriously, it's literally a swarming dump fest and most of the posters and commenters **aren't from this community.  You came here to disrupt this community with hostile intentions and so did I.**  To be completely honest, this is the truth.  I want to see BS and Zenimax taken down a notch too, but targeting the few players who enjoy this isn't right.
---
I'm not defending it. I am just tired if the same stupid hate argument.
---
This was what caused me to leave the main sub. At least here the criticism is justified, the main sub at 76‚Äôs launch was a fucking nightmare.
---
Well that makes sense why everyone is angry. Thanks
---
People really defend this game on here and say things like "we'll still be here."
---
Doing what exactly? Getting extorted and kicking rocks?
---
Who cares?
---
For, not from... my mistake üòÜ
---
I've heard of Star Wars.  Of course.  But do you honestly believe that the entire world takes notice every time a bunch of nerds get their panties ruffled about their favorite hobby?
---
I'm a musician.  I don't assume the Gibson Guitars controversies over the last few years are being discussed in  Star Wars circles.
---
Except this game is leaps and bounds above Runescape.
---
www.falloutfirst.com
---
&gt; can people server hop or is invite/friends only
---
Yes to both. Servers aren't persistent, so if your friend has a premium account and you're playing on his server, when he logs off, it's going to kick you out, and you'll have to go somewhere else to play.
---
&gt; even if its only 1 person out of 8 that pays i would say that is more than they make selling that one armor they would also still be selling it
---
What about Bethesda's behavior over the last year suggests they're going to let the player base compete with their own monetization of this game? Greed has informed every decision they've made, to a hilarious degree.
---
Was 80 cad for us
---
8 hours straight without a discount or crash. Yeah I would say they run better. It's almost like single player. And the AI is much more aggressive, not sure why. And a lot more Legendary.
---
Bethesda was and is involved in both games. ESO is successful and a really great community with literally tens of thousands paying a subscription... it‚Äôs a successful model. 
---
I saw the same thing for Fallout and actually wanted the same seeing the positive growth of the game and expanding it like ESO! 
---
I wrote it and expressed this a few times getting downvoted and trashed... thing is it turned out exactly that way... why? It‚Äôs a business using a successful model...
---
Can someone fill me in? They add a subscription for private servers and features everyone been asking for but can you not still play the game for free as it is right now?
---
It‚Äôs better to have it this way instead of the way it goes in ESO. You pay for a membership that has the DLC included or you buy the DLC separately. Here we will be getting the Wastlanders and all future DLC for free. The membership is worth a month buy for the atoms and to dump all your junk one time for some people and others will keep it for longer. I digress, the membership is not DLC.
---
I think you need a new job if $12 is a lot of money.
---
It is free; 
---
I've not put in more money than my first investment in the game (1 year ago, good ROI for the game)
---
I don't intend to put in new money.  
---
Anyway, there are many people that I can see here that pay unusual amount of money for Atoms to pay for the rest of us.
---
I feel like we're getting in the grey area between "microtransactions" and "DLC" which is a nonsense distinction as it is but we've basically all accepted it.
---
Even with its faults I still love this game and will continue to play but focusing on your last paragraph; no one should need to pay extra for the game to function without crashes and disconnects. I've been playing since April and my stability on PS4 hasn't noticeably improved. I've just come to accept that the game will probably crash or disconnect at the worst possible moment. I don't think a stable base game is too much to ask for before they start monetizing other things.
---
Understand some players are just as tired too. Tired of game breaking bugs and even broken 'premimum' services.
---
It didn't work before?  And you played 1060 hours?
---
Check out their website! www.falloutfirst.com
---
The outfit and emotes shouldn't of been paid for. But the junk stash and survival tent are trivial and make very little difference in gameplay. I'm not a Fo1st member and I don't feel locked out of anything. I still have full access to the entire game.
---
They don't care, already got your money. Now stop buying extra shit for the game, that'll make them re-think things. A few thousand letters to Ubisoft wouldn't hurt, either. Honestly, I kinda think FO76 needs to go the RDRO route.
---
W-wait what?
---
...
---
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!
---
How is private worlds dlc? It‚Äôs not now content so your point is invalid.
---
I'm not asking about what's better though. I'm asking if they said something and if the thing they said has held true.
---
&gt; The law you would want for games would fall under the FTC‚Äôs/FCC‚Äôs jurisdiction, particularly regarding fraud and false advertising. And these laws already exist, someone or multiple people would just have to file a complaint with those organizations first to get the ball rolling.
---
**+1**
---
So we had private worlds before Fallout 1st?
---
Are you talking about scraping your stuff because I‚Äôm pretty sure the stash box in the tent let‚Äôs you scrap junk and store junk unlike the others in the game
---
Found the meek, malleable boot licker. I bet you‚Äôd thank a man for raping you. Because of the privilege
---
It's not splitting hairs. Wild Appalachia was a DLC. It was free. Wastelanders is a DLC. It will be free. Nuclear Winter was a DLC. It was free. Fallout 1st is a subscription service that gives certain QoL features for a minimal fee. It is not DLC. Stop trying to reclassify something to validate your anger.
---
I‚Äôve come to the conclusion of only preordering from a few studios that I know Haven‚Äôt screwed me yet.  If they fuck up, they‚Äôre off that list.  Most studios I‚Äôd wait like a week to get reviews and bug reports before buying.  But others like EA and now Bethesda, they‚Äôre going to wait a least a month.  I want the swarm of vermin to crawl out of the trash pile before I‚Äôll consider buying their products.
---
I want to preorder, as an incentive for a studio that keeps faith with me so I can play the games I love the soonest.  I‚Äôll penalize any studio that betrays my trust, although give them some chance of redemption, but since that redemption needs a trend, that‚Äôs going to be multiple games, years of time.
---
oops i meant that to be a reply to a post further down sorry
---
They pushed back the wastelanders DLC to next year. This fallout1st thing isn't connected to DLC.
---
Gotcha thanks for responding, that's bullshit I played for the first couple months after I preordered and stopped playing so never saw this happen. Literally downloaded the game again last week and  I uninstalled it last night due to this fallout 1st. Absolutely ridiculous of them
---
thanks!  i will look for it when i play tonight or tomorrow night.
---
It doesnt allow you to scrap weapons or armor. And also it would be hella convenient to work on gear and do other things in your surivial camp.
---
The scrap box fundamentally changes how the gameplay loop is experienced. Besides that, say your right and most will be in their own world. Does that not effect me? Less players to trade with. Say you're wrong and they are only using their worlds to farm. 1st players will corner the market on bulk scrap and vending space. Either way this effects every non 1st player and the scrap box is the main reason. And when you say "improve the game" you must mean for you and your fellow subs because that is exactly what you're seeing.
---
Bethesda is pretty much printing money in every other area so yeah I don't imagine they're financially crippled. Even Fallout 76 is likely profitable. You interpret these paid services as a sign they aren't doing well but the reality is there is no amount of money that makes a company want to earn *less* money. Companies are always trying to earn more in any way they can.
---
you keep saying that and the playerbase keeps dwindling. but sure, let's just ignore the obvious problems until everyone's gone.
---
Private worlds are not additional content. 
---
This is no different than the VIP tables at a casino, or the box seats at a stadium. 
---
You want the premium services, you have to pay for those. 
---
The actual game content is not restricted by a paywall,  you can still do all the same quests, get all the same weapons and armor. 
---
What  you dont get is a second fast travel camp (that does not affect your ability to complete the same quests or farm the same gear), an unlimited junk box (junk does not increase your ability to defeat enemies), and some skins and a few dances.
---
These premium features do not impact the actual content of the game other than making QoL a little bit easier for those of us who chose to support the game with our wallets, which allows the developers to have more capital to design and implent new content in the future.
---
Most online games have a premium service.  However unlike fallout, those games actually do give an advantage to subscribers, for Example Neverwinter VIP status actually gets you an EXP and bonus currency and HP.    That is a PtW advantage.   An armor skin and bigger bag is not.
---
Content doesn't mean quest necessarily. It's shit you can use, do, etc. Yours is a misconception.
---
No no. Foolish, perhaps, but significantly less mentally disturbed.
---
We 100% need more of these posts to wake Bugthesda up.
---
What am i talking they never will.
---
Meh, you guys deserve it for supporting this garbage game. Even Beth know its garbage since they dont believe in their game and are just trying to milk the few blind fans.
---
I played it for 2 months after it came out. Happily actually, and I even hoisted my optimistic outlook into the Fallout sub where it was dangerous to have that opinion.
---
We chased holotapes, launched nukes and fought the scorched dragons imported from Skyrim. 
---
But it got real stale real quick. Servers would crash, bullet sponge enemies would drop 0 loot and players would manipulate aggro in nuke zones to steal your things.
---
There just wasn‚Äôt enough to do, and in the brief time I logged in recently - there still isn‚Äôt really anything left worth doing.
---
Okay, they refunded me the 500 atoms.
---
I mean...not really. I love fallout. As an idea, as a franchise. I hate fo76 even without the controversy and negativity. It's a bad game. You want more content, I want the game to be good first. That's obviously not going to happen anymore, but initially I thought that it could be salvaged. Not by more content, but by making the core gameplay loop feel good and be fun.
---
The game is still running very poorly on this old garbage engine. It's still full of bugs but that goes without saying. The last time I touched it was a few weeks ago to test my new GPU and in the 20 mins I played I had like 3 glitches and then the game crashed. 
---
The gunplay is still atrocious - in a game in which all you do is explore and shoot things. The story is still presented by lifeless holo-tapes. The rpg-elements are still bland. The card system is just bad. The one thing they got somewhat right is the exploring, but it's just not backed up by acceptable gameplay so it ends up not mattering.
---
Let's not create a narrative in which bethesda thinks this game is acceptable and it's just the greed of the higher ups destroying it. The game got terrible ratings because it's not good. At that point pay-to-win and all of the other problems weren't even a thing yet.
---
&gt;Bethesda has been going downhill since 2009 when they were riding off the massive success of Fallout 3, still praised endlessly for Oblivion, about to release Obsidian's New Vegas (one of the most popular western RPG's of all time) and a year out from launching Skyrim, also one of the most lauded RPG's of the generation
---
What are you smoking?
---
you can play the game for free. however, the private servers are only available if you buy the fallout 1st subscription which is 13.99 a month (or 99.99 a year). 
---
the private servers are **DEDICATED.** the host of the server is allowed to invite and allow players into **THEIR** servers. however, when the host leaves (and this fallout 1st has had a lot of people crashing), the world shuts down and everything you have done in that server is gone.
---
I fear for the future of Fallout.  I fear leaving Fallout 5 in these people's hands.  Nothing they've done with F76 makes sense unless you view it as a cynical data mining and MLM exercise that will end next year with a final embarrassing spasm of free to play panhandling.  I'm old enough to never expect a big faceless company to care about me personally, but I am offended at how little they care about Fallout.
---
I don't play this game, but it is crazy how Bethesda is proving that they really don't care at all about anything other than money.
---
When they released FO76, they have shown that they don't give a fk about putting out a good product as long as they can trick people into buying it.
---
When they had the bag debacle, they showed that they were perfectly fine with not even providing the product that their customers bought. It is not important to them because being a pre order bonus, they already got their money.
---
They promised there be only cosmetic microtransactions to get your money the first time. They easily broke that promise to squeeze out more money from the people still playing the game.
---
They have now put out a subscription model for the game, selling additional features that are outright broken. What earns more money than selling something for minimal effort right?
---
It is very very clear that putting out a good product was never on their cards at all. They simply don't care. Their reputation has sky dived since the release of this game, yet they have barely done enough to regain consumer trust. At every decision, they have chosen to only find more ways in reducing their expenditure and increasing their sales.
---
If they were truly serious about mending their reputation, they could have done so much more. Don't tell me bs like, they need to keep the lights on etc so they need to release shit like this to keep the sales up. You mean to tell me all those Skyrim ports didn't gain them any profit? Surely they have some money in their coffers to burn for rainly days. If they had wanted to regain that lost trust, they could have easily took a hit in their profits to pour resources into the game to make the experience as good as it can be for the remaining people still playing the game.
---
It's incredibly sad that Bethesda can't even do it right for the last remaining players who still love the game, despite the state the game is in. As someone who loves video games, it is so sad that Bethesda are only using this medium as a means to scam people into spending their money.
---
Ahhh here we go... It‚Äôs not about the 12$ obviously you donkey, it‚Äôs about what this money gets you and what players who don‚Äôt have the subscription don‚Äôt get. The ‚Äûcosmetic only‚Äú or ‚Äûthere will be no extra fees for ingame bonuses‚Äú promises etc... ahhh what do I even try, some stupid fanboys would pay another hundreds of dollars for additions and still would hAvE a bLaSt.
---
Interesting. My camp is right near the Whitespring Station. Looping machine gun noises were 24/7 up until Wed. The place is totally quiet now.
---
My buddy‚Äôs 50cal also quiets down when it‚Äôs supposed to.
---
Stop trying to pretend this sub is some altruistic haven for ‚Äúgamers‚Äù and not a place for collective dumbasses to blindly support unethical gaming practices. Whether you ‚Äúlike‚Äù the game or not, simply by playing you enable to them to treat consumers like dogs.
---
I'm...not angry at all actually. I'm more curious. What distinguishes Fallout 1st from DLC? It seems like the only real difference is that it's a subscription instead of a flat rate. Is the difference the quantity of the content being offered? 
---
Let me put it this way: if Fallout 1st was offered as a free update in the same way as Wild Appalachia, would that make it a DLC? 
---
Either way we're getting off subject. I'm really just trying to find a specific image here as I explained in the original post.
---
I deemed it fanatical because people were going nuts about the concept **12 YEARS AGO**.
---
Lmao so you admit you're intellectually dishonest?
---
Actually, what they did was change junk to be stored as a.... currency essentially. So now instead if it having to be tracked 10,000 times for 10,000 pieces of steel, they just give it a quantity and save that quantity. It's LESS strain on the servers.
---
I didn't regret it much either. Just now I know that Wastelanders might not be good because of this type of monetization and scummy 'backtracking' on promises.
---
I was really excited about Wastelanders.
---
I think all the articles from IGN, Forbes and just about every other gaming news site will get more of their attention than 200 posts on the fo76 subreddit that all have the exact same title
---
"It's all free after launch". It doesn't seem pretty obvious what he meant.
---
&gt; We all love 76. 
---
That's a flat out lie.  You've obviously been very selective in  the posts you've been reading on r/FO76 over the last two/three days.
---
Okey the crashing part must be horrible. I hope they sort that out for those who play on private servers
---
Bye Felicia, 
---
Take your own advice and leave. 
---
You made a rant post about rant posts.
---
Everything helps.
---
 Theyre stuggling to find people who will play this game and the ones that do are being treated like shit.
---
Maybe option 4# comes with the launch of wastelanders or the launch of starfield. But that's far away.
---
Any way, I still think positive about this, I'll still thinking that all will be alright.
---
Visa gift card maybe?
---
Afraid? Future? Bethesda is a company, like they care about what you think of the game after you bought it. TeS6 will suck too, but the money through preorders alone is gonna make Todd forget any bad press. Stop preordering games if you really want to scare a game studio
---
How do you define what is "actual" content and what isn't? It seems pretty arbitrary to me. They easily could have created a free update with all these features (or even one with a flat rate), and I think people would've been fine calling it "DLC". Would you still be saying it's not DLC?
---
I think he meant this sub was more positive about FO76 than anywhere else. Which is true, just a low bar to clear.
---
u/Yabvone can you help?
---
DLC stands for downloadable content. What exclusive content were you able to download after you paid for 1st? Nothing because it was all in the free update 14.
---
Has anyone seen any Legendary Scorchbeasts beyond 1-Star? I've seen 3 1-stars so far, but nothing higher. I hope they aren't always 1-star.
---
This forum a beacon of positivity?!?!!  Look man this forum has been a place to maybe find builds and discuss some issues but it‚Äôs toxic as hell.
---
I‚Äôve never seen anything like it I mean...wait yeah is basically every other game forum with entitled gamers.
---
It‚Äôs simple support the game if you like it.
---
Leave it if you don‚Äôt.  
---
You guys are way too caught up in this thing and this is coming from a gaming addict since the days of Atari 2600.
---
Take a break....play something else and come back.
---
I thought the scrap bot and fridge thing was out of hand but damn guys.........thank god 80% of the FO76 player base doesn‚Äôt come here.
---
Thank you for your sane critic. Really. You write (sadly unusually for this sub) rational about the topic.
---
But I don't feel ripped. I was always sure, since I've read the EULA and heard an interview with Howard before launch, that there will definitely be any big changes. Also with the payment model. The atomic shop was a joke in the beginning, I always wondered if the shop itself could really create any profits. Since the stuff has to be created by employees and we even get free atoms.
---
Other games are even worse imo, they charge you to just be able to play the game, after you've already payed for the software itself.
---
And 1st didn't take anything away from me, it's just a convenience addition (that also takes their server capacities with saving and loading) and doesn't affect the storyline. I'm also sure they won't dare to charge for DLCs.
---
Have fun wanderer, hope you'll come back one day. The wasteland needs sane people ‚úåÔ∏è
---
INB4 Wastelanders only for 1st members.
---
Yes it stacks,
---
No its not worth it.  You are better off running Bullet shield instead.  Its a better use of 3 perk points.
---
I think I'm mostly just confused about what "DLC" actually means lol.
---
AFAI understand it, private world is there for people who want to play privately between a closed group of friends.
---
* scrapbox: meh ... really, you need tons of useless junk ?
---
* survival tent: fast travel ?!? lol, it's cheap already.
---
* Atoms: I don't really care about more cosmetic stuff, even if 1600 is a good chunk of atom. (it think someone computed the cost of buying 1600 atoms each month versus subscribing to 1st.
---
* Ranger Armor: nothing to write home about. (personally, I've not changed armor in months)
---
* emotes and icons : HAhahahahah worthless.
---
I get that. That doesn't mean to start bringing out the dumb arguments though.
---
Bethesda deserves a lot of the flack they are getting and have gotten, no doubt about that, but it helps when we actually understand what is going on and what things involve.
---
Is it acceptable that the junk stash has an issue l ike this? No, not at all. It better get fixed, ESPECIALLY since it is behind a recurring pay wall. But is it possible they simply never encountered the issue in their testing? Yes, very possible.
---
All top management in Bethesda, including CEO, needs to be fired and replaced. Nothing short of replacing CEO can ever change the current self destructive course
---
&gt; Farmable flora and fauna (specifically nukes)
---
There is no competition over farmable flora in nuke zones, everyone gets their own flora.
---
Oh! I didn't know all this stuff was available to everyone. So whats the subscription for?
---
Who are "these people"?
---
yep, it's totally a "rant" when you suggest that people actually solve their problem instead of reeee-ing in an internet forum.
---
As a price of $15, is it worth a try?
---
All I want from private servers is for them to be persistent so I don't have to go reclaim workshops
---
I don't know about you but the horse armor meme exists for a reason. and it's not just to make a mockery out of Bethesda.
---
Lmao, people like you are the reason why people come visit this subreddit. Watch your mind be blown: this sub used to have more people that all quit. Those people are not trolls, they come back to see how the sub reacts to the changes of the game they USED TO play.
---
If you think that the drama and "big fuss" surrounding fallout 1st isn't justified you are out of your mind.
---
I just want the Ranger Armor, but damned if I'm going to subscribe to have it.
---
A tent and stash box isnt content.
---
As a daily Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign user‚Ä¶ there are bugs. Bugs that cause you to lose work. Work that is critical to me being paid when I‚Äôm freelancing.
---
Way bigger stakes there than some edge case bug in an entertainment video game.
---
It‚Äôs not ... not in the three months that I‚Äôve been lurking here.
---
Their sales could be much much higher though. Theyre dumb
---
I love how they disappear instead of apologizing or saying ANYTHING
---
So if I have speed demon I shouldn‚Äôt use lock and load. Is bullet shield really that good?
---
**Meat Week:**
---
1x stimpack or super stim, 1x bottle of some type of beer, 1x of some cooked food, 1x Tato Salad, 3 Meat Cleavers, a 2.25% chance of a Red Firework Mine, a chance of a one star legendary armor, and then if you got to 100% you get something off the following list:
---
* Plan: Meat Cleaver
---
* Bloody Chef Hat
---
* Grillmaster's Hat
---
* Plan: Meat Week Flag
---
* Plan: Shishkebab
---
* Plan: Flamer
---
* Tenderizer
---
* Recipe: Tato Salad
---
* Plan: Spicy Tenderizer Mod
---
* Plan: Peppered Tenderizer Mod
---
* Plan: Salty Tenderizer Mod
---
* Bloody Chef Outfit
---
If your progress was between 75 and 100, then you only got a 67% chance of getting something off the list above. If you were between 50 and 75, then you had a 34% chance of getting something off the above list. Below 50, you get nothing. You lose! Good day sir!
---
Fasnacht will take a bit longer to write up but I'll get that soon as well.
---
You heard about the private servers not being private and the stash box eating your scrap right?
---
Later dude see you Monday.
---
Donkey..... I love it. Right away, no slowly devolving debate skills. Straight to being a chump. I can respect that. The instant downvote was a nice little flourish to cap it off.
---
If they put something to break down the junk in the survival tent who will buy scrap kits?
---
The more the merrier. And I mean money.
---
Nice little narrative you are spinning there to justify being an absolute tool for a company. I am sure they really need your help. Poor little guys running out of money.
---
This sounds more like your subjective evaluation of these items rather than if it is or isn't content or DLC. 
---
But either way, if all of this stuff is available to everyone, then I guess I don't understand what the subscription is for.
---
I agree, I cant stand the P2W argument, because its diverting people from the real problems
---
They never once promised unlimited storage. You and others have completely fabricated that to justify your anger. Stop. Either play or don't play, pay or don't pay; but stop lieing to people to try and sway them to your point of view. It's petty and childish.
---
apparently the new scrap box DOES treat your stuff like garbage ;-)
---
Are you looking at the right items
---
So what's the subscription for?
---
They have something that breaks down the junk tho lol
---
By your logic then all Atom Shop content should also be free
---
Down Loadable Content.
---
It used to mean anything that you downloaded which added stuff to the game. These days it's usually any DLC... damn I suck at explaining stuff. Um I guess you could just say any expansions that add more content to the game and things like
---
I had wanted them to add at least a bedroll to the backpack and a respwn point for the bedroll, maybe a small camp fire, so when I am off in the wilds I can worry less about dying far away.
---
modders wouldnt be competing with bethesda,bethesda would be charging a sub to access mods that isnt a competion between bethesda and modders lots of people would pay a sub for mod support,as for greed lots of modders might support this depending on how they do it lots of modders arent happy similar to bethesda how money is distributed in modding some youtubers make over 50k a month covering mods (that they dont even ask can they use there assets in there videos they then say there not making enough money with youtube ads aswell lol) when people asked to remove paid mods last time they said they wanted it replaced with a donation system they didnt donate (atleast to modders)
---
The new content was said to rely heavily on the instancing tech also used in Vault 94, so regardless of whether it is intentional or not, it could indeed play better on a private world.
---
I haven't gotten my hands on a junkies explosive handmade but my non-explosive semi auto gets a hair under 140 base damage with all 3 rifleman cards maxed. Start factoring in additional modifiers and it can hit really hard.
---
I mean, Fallout 76 is basically a mobile game at this point.
---
I played junkies on one of my alts, I used a JE handmade in semi auto for PVE. Hardened receiver has higher damage than Powerful Auto receiver, so you end up using less ammo. For PVP i would imagine Power Auto is the way to go.
---
To rent a private server, not for exclusive content that no one else can play. You didnt download any exclusive game modes or missions after subbing to 1st, you got acess to the same game as everyone else just by yourself.
---
Free? More like 500 atoms my friend. What a steal!
---
Ummm. Zenimax is a private company. So "appeasing shareholders" is irrelevant. Good try, though.
---
For people who want to play in a closed/private world
---
So then how is this not DLC? You're adding private worlds, a new outfit, and some QoL stuff that should be in the base game. Based on your description, it feels like the only set definition is what the company decides to consider DLC for their own convenience.
---
All your arguments against it are "it takes away space for players actual camps" then why not make it so that the forward camp is cancelled when the player logs out? Like with workshops etc. and that if your second camp is in conflict for space with the main camp of a player who wants to join the server then the forward camp should be destroyed.
---
How is it not? It's 100% optional, and it's only $13. The value is incredible for what it costs. Plus, it will go to support a game I was worried would get ahit down, because everyone screaming right now could have stopped this by buying atoms once a month instead of exclusively using the free ones.
---
I‚Äôve got some decent drops at Fort Defiance.
---
Why uninstall the game but continue to read fo76 reddit?  No one is going to beg you come back. Learn to move on.
---
No im currently in tenerife on my holidays i came across this whole situation  last night haven't really been keeping up with the latest updates. Really? How is the scrapbox not working if you could enlighten me?
---
That third perk made it unique mate. I payed 15 k caps more than average junkie explosive just for it to be weightless .
---
With iD behind the reigns, I'm remaining positive about Doom Eternal.
---
So you're paying for a solo feature. How is that not content?
---
Buttery smooth, more legendaries, picking up items that were a pain in public servers (mainframe cores in the silos for example) are instant, items like the basketballs at the Grafton school respawn much faster. Amazing performance. Unfortunately though I lost months worth of junk build up to the scrap box glitch, so that sours it.
---
It's called having a different perspective, not that I'm out of mind. Why are you so extreme lol
---
I don't own a subscription, but it's not even private servers, they're private sessions.
---
They want compensation for the time and effort the Devs put into this game. 
---
They asked the subscriber base to contribute. 
---
We did. 
---
If you dont want to pay, dont.  You still have access to all of the same content we do.  Just without a second camp and some free skins.
---
People that pay always get better results than those that dont. 
---
You can buy better groceries with money than you can food stamps.  You can get better healthcare if you pay for it instead of using Medicare.  You get better housing if you buy it instead of having it provided. 
---
So why should non paying players get the same stuff and resources that paying members do.    This is not how society works.  Unless you are in a socialist society like Venezuela.   Look how that turned out.
---
I‚Äôm sorry but where is actual content hidden behind a paywall? The only things I can really think of are the tent (pretty useless but cool) and the scrap box (I liked the inventory management aspect of the game but some people apparently have a hard time, so this is for them. )
---
Do we have to pay for quests? Do we need to spend money for weapons or special abilities? When they talk about paid DLC, this is what they are talking about. Things that expand the game.
---
I feel like it was more of a cheap clear lighter with about 3 uses left, than end up flicking it watching the spark come out and expecting a little flame, and ends up being sparks...again.
---
So you're paying a monthly fee for a solo mode?
---
\^ this game is about base building. The post is a criticism ALL games have. But I'd point out that these people just don't like the game. Almost every game people say the same thing "no content" and it's one of the dumbest critiques of any game. 
---
Do you like playing the game and the core game loop? If the answer is yes that is the motivations for playing the game. The extras are always just icing on the cake. If your complaining the cake isn't good and there needs to be more icing... then you don't like the cake and no amount of icing will change that.
---
Love how I'm downvoted but the history of this game proves I'm right...
---
The comment made over 350 days ago that said Bethesda was going to do this exact thing got downvoted to hell.
---
Look who was right..
---
Oh
---
for PvP goes faster fire rate instead of explosive. The extra 8 damage per shot isn't worth it on a rifle. I do however find its worth it on my heavy junkies gunner with demo expert rank 5 because its something like 75 per hit with my gatling gun, and that is just tasty. Personally I find that heavy gunners out DPS rifleman. I have both. Just an opinion
---
&gt;They told us FOUR MONTHS AGO that their original vision was not going to work, and they told us a week or two ago that they're going to have to put more "useful" stuff available for purchase if the game is to survive financially.
---
That's not what they said though. They said the community asked for you. There were a bunch of lies in those statements but this community doesn't seem to care about being lied to and then asked for money.
---
Idk how you could forget but fo76 cost 60 bucks on release. That's the price of a triple A title. And then they sold a bunch of overpriced merch on top of it. You are not honestly believing that they are doing this to survive. That is ridiculous.
---
Right now we need EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING.VOICE.
---
They need to wake up and get their fucking shit together.
---
They need to feel the anger and hatred. Even if it doesnt change anything about 76, they should know they are pieces of shit.
---
I feel that being asked to pay extra for a game with fewer crashes and disconnects is wrong.
---
That's a whole another argument about non-cosmestic, community requested items that should've been implemented within the lackluster DLCs.
---
Do you think they care?
---
Less lag but still have a lot of spikes. Might be because I keep all my weapons on me and it's over 50 pieces. It was nice not having to compete over Horde events though. As an aside, public events feel so fucking good now that they lowered the cooldown on them. Was nice knowing everything was available like legendaries
---
Not sure why you are downvoted lol. This is pretty much an abusive relationship.
---
I did not see this one coming.
---
From the video I watched if you put stuff in the new ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù scrap box it has a chance of just deleting everything inside it. I‚Äôm not sure how to avoid it or how it happens but people are not very happy about it.
---
You should try The Outer Worlds, man.
---
If you use heavies, its extra DR, which means less damage. 
---
I dont use Lock and Load because Speed Demon is sufficient.
---
I use Bullet Sheild because more DR is way better than an extra half second on my reload speed.
---
A small number of people hve an issue... just take your stuff out of the scrap box if you are that concerned
---
I went private and nuked WS on Wednesday night.  Having the place to myself was nice but only one run through was a bummer.  This is big!
---
I roleplay and have fun doing something else than grinding and farming legendaries and nuking. But the fact of having a 'full working' version of the game for premium black label subscribers is wrong. It affects everyone, and I cant be happy about it. It Is just wrong and unfair. Why can you store unlimited junk while I can't? Why can you cause real damage with your shotgun and I can't ?
---
Solve your problem by leaving and not reading this sub if your bugged by it..
---
I bought the damn game on release day. Haven‚Äôt played it in months. I have a better time playing highlands
---
I'd honestly love to get back into the game if it weren't so buggy, laggy, and restrictive for things like inventory management and base building. However, this recent news about a subscription has taken that desire completely away even if they were able to fix the game and these issues. Obviously the subscription appears to fix the inventory issues, but forcing players to pay subscription fees in order to get that completely reverses it. 
---
I tried to get back into it a few months ago after backpacks were added, but the frame rate was so poor I could barely play the game in certain areas or in certain encounters. I lasted a few play sessions and gave up again. 
---
From the trailers and whatnot before the game came out, I was looking forward to building bases with my friends. We did that during the Beta and had a blast. While we can still build in workshops, nothing is saved and makes progress non-existent. [I made a post about re-working workshops a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a3f1tm/i_think_im_done_with_workshops_until_they_get_a/) to make them more worthwhile. Granted I haven't played for quite some time so maybe something has changed, but these were my thoughts on the system. 
---
If Bethesda sticks to a subscription system, I won't be coming back to this game even if they manage to fix it. Such a shame the path Bethesda has been going down these past few years. As much as I'd like to say I'm looking forward to their future games like Elder Scrolls 6, I'm terrified about how it may be treated.
---
did you apply a skin to it?
---
I meant @L120, the final reward for Roses questline was not worth it.  
---
The game itself, I still overall find satisfying to play.
---
Charleston Capitol Building
---
Oh im sorry to hear that what happened?
---
Yeah but it's only friends who can join. If you don't want someone showing up, appear as offline. Also why would you have people on your friends list you don't want popping up?
---
I loled when I saw that.
---
Essentially yes solo or with a group of 7 friends. Its not like your subbing to an equivalent of the pit from F3 or nukaworld from F4, those are DLC and if something similar was paywalled in 76 then I would understand the outrage.
---
This would be something that would make them feel worth spending money on. And the ability for your friends you invite to join even if you are not on. You could make a workshop into a group base and do some pretty cool builds
---
But thats what they said cosmetics were for: to make money for the developers so updates would be free. That was their whole rationale for microtransactions. So that other stuff would be free.
---
&gt;  the ONLY reason I would even consider getting a sub would be true PRIVATE servers.
---
The reason why this game went even worse than before is right there in that sentence .
---
You WOULD give money for it !! And with players like you , that's why they make this games, cause ppl like you WILL buy if the offer is good enough.
---
So instead of not milking the playersbase they should offer better rewards for the p2w right ? :D
---
Yes. It most definitely is. Trust me its addicting.
---
If you think thats funny, you should see how funny it is to watch a person give thanks for being robbed. These arent tears of sadness, they are tears of laughter because we're all laughing at you.
---
I dont think people realize you're taking a shot at those assholes who ask for people's shit when they quit.
---
Or it's those assholes that are downvoting
---
Bethesda is charging more for one power armor skin than they're charging for a month's subscription. If eight people can play on a modded server and access to mods costs Bethesda *one* cash shop sale, they've lost potential revenue. They're not going to do that. You can argue that it would make sense for them to do that, but the way they've been running this game hasn't made sense when interpreted through any lens except draining whales as much as possible.
---
I don't understand why so many people seem to think Bethesda is going bankrupt? They pretty much print money with their main releases on top of producing several other extremely successful games like DOOM, Wolfenstein, Rage, Prey, Dishonored, Evil Within, ESO, Fallout Shelter (the list goes on). Fallout 76 isn't even in their main dev house and has been worked on mainly by smaller Bethesda studios in Texas. I would be extremely surprised to see Fallout 76 isn't profitable they just likely want it to be *more* profitable.
---
If you read the comments you would know for me that process is a little in undoable.
---
I do photography and web work daily, I haven‚Äôt had enough bugs with it to even be upset about. Some of the bugs appearance may be tied to OS and hardware related circumstances however. But I mean, if we take OPs stance into account, it‚Äôs justified to spend/pour more money into something that isn‚Äôt functioning properly. Why not just batch apply this motto to work since it already has been applied to fun hobbies like video gaming.
---
So unless it has more content, it's not DLC. So if it has LESS content then it's okay to charge for it because it doesn't count as DLC? That feels backwards...
---
Yep it is hope they dont change it was the only reason i got them
---
Wow that's a major bug jesus christ so all the junk you put into it just vanishes?
---
When the publisher owns the studio wholesale - which is the case with id - they *are* that straightforward.
---
Got the itch to play just the other day. It had been months since I last booted it up. Signed in to be bombarded with fallout 1st bullshit. Said fuck it and uninstalled the game and reinstalled FO4. I'm done.
---
&gt;I dont even want to know how vauable it was with all those 3 stars before.
---
so you doooo know how valuable it was then. 
---
Also the rifle will still weigh about 10 or more lbs with the 3rd perk, not weightless, so I'm smelling bullshit on this post in one way or another.
---
It‚Äôs all RNG so there‚Äôs no definitive ‚Äòbetter‚Äô locations. Last night I went to cranberrybog and killed a legendary scorchbeast and a legendary sentry bot, both dropped just one star crap. Back to WS, in the same run, I got two three star keepers. At other times it could be all garbage, but WS needs less ammo since ghouls are farmer-friendly, so it‚Äôs my go-to placeüëå
---
Yo, I did it last night for cod and Outer worlds
---
They didnt make this as an offline game.  I think they have stated that on numerous occasions. 
---
If you want to play an offline Fallout, they have several.  Fallout1,2,3,4,NV,BoS
---
What areas do the spikes occur in the most?
---
Some people can't handle it. It's rough out here. lol
---
I don‚Äôt know man. You are complaining but haven‚Äôt actually lost anything. Just put everything on your person.
---
A lot of people like to play merchant, and its easier if you add people to your friends list, I guess, I‚Äôm not talking from experience this is just what I‚Äôve heard online.
---
Pretty much any person commenting on news articles
---
Your post history is a cesspool of cringeworthy shilling. Blink twice if Todd has your family hostage and making you to post this stuff.
---
My PA is t51b helmet, x-01 torso, t-60 arms n legs
---
Lol. People have been doing their ragequit posts since before the game even released,  why would they stop now?
---
Just took a quick peak, Im at work and cant check it out too much. It's an open alpha, so youve been playing it?
---
Honestly that would be well worth the 100/year. While I'm not against a subscription service for fo76, as there are a ton of other online games that offer one, I do feel like this one was very poorly timed
---
Can't happen because their way to code recipe won't allow, they will need to do a new recipe for each meat. Bad coding issue.
---
I don't get it with you whiners, I really don't. Nothing has really changed, you play on public servers, you don't have to subscribe, what am I missing. Private servers right not are just isolated instances .. yeah I get what it can become, but by that time the game will be dead ..
---
The subreddit is a reflection of how players feel. If they are doing bullshit and pissing off the players, the sub will reflect that. I don't want a fake, censored sub that makes it seem like everything is fine when the devs are making questionable decisions.
---
question - if you go back to adventure, what comes back with you ? ie. if you get something only available on a p/server does it stay with you ?
---
Thanks for the feedback. I definitely don‚Äôt want to express ‚Äúoutrage‚Äù, just my personal disappointment. 
---
I honestly don‚Äôt have a problem with charging for private servers - this is a necessary expense, and games like Minecraft do it (albeit much cheaper). I don‚Äôt have a problem with the atom allowance either. But we‚Äôve all asked for utility and quality of life fixed in the game, and to not only pay wall access to those requests but that paywall never ends if you want to keep them just leaves a gross feeling that I don‚Äôt get with other monetization schemes for other games.
---
I did mate. If i remove that skin does it revert the loss of third star?
---
&gt;Do you honestly expect a company to release a game, maintain servers, provide new content, pay their employees, develop new games from just the initial purchase price of a game? Come on man!!
---
Hang on a second let me just go and check...yep, Warcraft 3 still online.
---
I started playing it but will always keep tabs on 76
---
I stand corrected.
---
Edit: I've never seen a company shoot themselves in the foot as badly as this since I bought Anthem.
---
Yep, it gets eaten, at first Bethesda thought it was a bug that caused it to simply not appear in the box, like it was invisible, despite it really being there, but Bethesda came out and fully admitted that it is actually just disappearing
---
You should check out the Outer Worlds!
---
west tek
---
Any place with a lot of mobs. One Violent Night, Project Paradise, and the prime fissure site. I really do think it's my wwr armor. Also with One Violent Night it's SO GOOD not to have to worry about people playing music
---
No, call me leaving.
---
The Outer Worlds is amazing so far. Can't see myself going back to FO76.
---
Playing the game is playing the what they were saying is a hate crime that know should deal with
---
Yep,I was actually considering it too cause my biggest problem with the game was storage space but whew did I dodge a bullet. hopefully they fix it pronto.
---
So if someone justs clicks on my profile and clicks join game they can enter my server?
---
On a baseline: I don't much care. I've played numerous subscription games over the years and fundamentally this is no different. Star Wars, Star Trek, hell I stopped playing WoW for this last year (mostly 'cause early BfA got really boring after a while, but that's a different topic.)  
---
Fees pay wages and "keep the lights on" as it were.  
---
I have no use for the Private Servers, but the Ranger gear is certainly a neat base and I'm genuinely amused by the dancing emotes. To me, those are a fine use of the fee, for the time being at least.  
---
The scrap thing? I don't care about. Basically saves me a half hour a month of going through and chucking out whatever I've mindlessly accrued as a result of scrapping guns and other things. It's handy, but it hardly matters.  
---
All and all, if this means the game sticks around when I'm inclined to take a little "vacation" into blasted VW, then that's fine by me.
---
I was with my friends no problem, not lag like there was in public servers. There was seven of us the first night, five the second
---
Oh I'm still excited for Fallout 5 , Starfield, and TES VI. I'm just hesitant (to put it likely) to jump back into Fallout 76. Why reward them with maintaining my place in a player base?
---
Cool, so if it's less strain on the servers, then why wasn't it a solution when everyone had problems with storage and implemented part of a DLC.
---
"COMMUNIST DETECTED ON AMERICAN SOIL!"
---
boy, bye
---
Yep. So if you want to be alone, appear as offline
---
I really don't remember where I saw this or how accurate it is, but I think it does put things into a good perspective.
---
Out of every individual player, only like 10% of them will find a community discussing the game. Only 10% of those will interact with the community at some point. And then 10% of them will be regulars constantly interacting with them.
---
Now I have a feeling those numbers are extremely off, but the relative sizes of each group is true. The vastly overwhelming majority of the audience  aren't here.
---
i don't own one but i spent most of yesterdays on a few of my friends while i sit here on the fence. here are some points from my experiences.
---
- raids and silos or anything needing a server response runs super smooth, we had no door delay yesterday, probably the best raid experience I've ever had.
---
- uncontested workshops makes them feel useable now. not gonna waste more mats than you would earn.
---
- public events (event dependant) can suck on a server if its not one thats easy to solo
---
Loot it once? While other ppl get infinite? No thanks.
---
And I just explained why it still affects me.
---
because the subject is still news. will eventually stop following. i'll move on when i feel like it. in the meantime you can follow your own advice when reading my comments.
---
It's not a different perspective unless you consider things like the alex jones sandy hook conspiracy a "different perspective" and not complete lunacy.
---
I did the same!
---
this subreddit is such a circle-jerk.  
---
like... hundreds of posts in the sub about "I AM SO DONE WITH THIS GAME!" but then when someone like you or myself ACTUALLY is done with the game and uninstalls it those other people are like "GOOD RIDDANCE!"
---
it's more fun to freakout on internet forums than solve your problem i guess
---
Sounds better than fallout worst
---
Damn I didn't see this coming.
---
First world problems

Wow

For the future of all Bethesda games. These assholes tried implementing paid mods in Skyrim. Would still be there if it weren't for the backlash. These guys are up there with EA. They have turned into a shit company
---
Huh? Private companies still have investors, their shares just aren't open to public trading. In Zenimax's case, Providence Equity has invested over $400 million in them since 2007. Much of Bethesda's change in philosophy may have been motivated by a desire to keep Providence invested in them.  
---
Also possible, as outlined in the video, is that Zenimax is preparing to go public.
---
You get $16 dollars worth of atoms, a outfit, stash box, a tent which can be placed anywhere, privacy. I would say it is worth trying for sure. Every month you get $16 dollars of atoms I believe, so  if you a regular atom buyer, it is well worth it.
---
Thanks for answering the question. Content is content.
---
i have a  few ideas how too get over the technical problems so im sure they do aswell,as for what will sell more one armor or a sub to access mods i think the sub will make more money and bethesda can do both
---
That's fine, friend. I appreciate it, glad we could reach an agreement!
---
I have everything on that list already except for Utomik. You can have more than one thing man. Imma get Disney+ soon too. (We dont mess with cable anymore) And i have amazon prime for the shipping and Dr. Who.
---
Oh, they're adding test servers? So they can test things in a game that was supposed to be finished a year ago? Do you even read back what you're saying to yourself? The game was broken at launch, it was feature incomplete *at launch*. You were sold a bill of goods a year ago and they're now expecting you to pay them 100$ for the privilege of having access to the features that people right here in this subr have been asking for, for a *year* now.
---
Things that should have come with the game for 60 dollars a year ago.
---
Wake up, open your eyes and read the writing on the wall. Fallout 76 is not a good game and Bethesda are not your friends. :P
---
Private instances are intended to take a break from other people and or play with friends only not to play fo76 like a single player title
---
I look at the scrapbox, and see the craft bag from ESO plus
---
The map is massive. There would still be plenty of space to place your camp.
---
I think (like with everything from Bethesda) it‚Äôll be fixed in few months but for now I‚Äôd steer clear.
---
Just give it time, those months go by fast. Its a 15 Dollar DLC every month, basically.
---
Most of the people are not acting like mature adults. Paying $100/year for a private server looks very reasonable and it includes a few additional minor perks. It was done with the typical bethesda quality control (none at all) but I am sure they will fix this pretty quickly. It will help put money into the game and fund content for everyone. It is not like there is any content as part of this.
---
Yeah, I'll have to delete all like 3 of them. RIP the bugged achievements that just never unlocked for me.
---
The infinitely firing machine gun is one that I could name off the top of my head that's still not fixed.
---
This. Same with "swim at your own risk" type signs. They are only there so gullable folks will say "shucks, guess I can't sue them, then."
---
100% the fanbases fault for still encouraging it.
---
And guess what? People STILL got the subscription and now shocked the private servers is riddled with bugs LOL. It is hard to feel bad for people this stupid.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen with shotguns and the responder skin in the past, they can do nothing to fix the weapon
---

---
the amount of players still defending the sub service in the comments of various threads of this sub reddit makes me lose hope in humanity making common sense decisions. Dunno why ppl keep giving bethesda money so that they can  talk down to the fans of this game and be condescending. All those ppl paying money just allowing themselves to be used. Its so sad to watch.
---
&gt;That's not what they said though. 
---
That is exactly what they said.
---
&gt;They said the community asked for you. 
---
I can assure you, nobody asked for me.
---
&gt;There were a bunch of lies in those statements but this community doesn't seem to care about being lied to and then asked for money.
---
LOL...this is a delusional sentence.  Have you seen the front page of this subreddit?  The community has been screaming "LIARS!" for a good while, whether true or not.  They will vigorously downvote your comment if you explain to them that what they consider to be "promises" were never made.  They don't want to hear it.  They want to run with the least favorable interpretation of the statements that were made at release time and let the rage flow.  
---
&gt;Idk how you could forget but fo76 cost 60 bucks on release. 
---
Who said I forgot?  I didn't forget.
---
&gt;That's the price of a triple A title. And then they sold a bunch of overpriced merch on top of it. You are not honestly believing that they are doing this to survive. That is ridiculous.
---
They're doing this because we live in a capitalist country, and businesses exist for the sole purpose of making money.  I haven't seen their profit sheets on this game and neither has anyone in this community, as far as I know.  But what they have told us is that the game could not survive without upping the amount of money it brings in.  You can choose to believe that, or choose to believe it's just greed, but either way neither of us really knows.  I know they had to know that this new move would get backlash and they did it anyway, so they must value the money more than the goodwill.  That means either they really need the money or they're just greedy past the point of caring.  Without being closer to the situation, you can either take a charitable interpretation (they're telling the truth and the game isn't strong enough to survive financially without this) or you can take a non-charitable one (they're already rolling in dough from this game and just want more, more, more).  I don't know for a fact which one it is.  But I do know that the outrage over it is so overblown and pathetic that I can't take people seriously.
---
Appreciate it mate thanks for letting us know
---
Yeah I'm a big trader, I have over 200 friends on my list. I'm actually gonna try to host Flea Market Fridays now. We'll see how it goes
---
They did? Do you have a link to them saying that? I admit I must've missed that! I wonder how other games with multiplayer features work without a monthly fee then.
---
But otherwise it seems the general rule of thumb is that if it's too small to be considered DLC, then it's okay to charge for it.
---
&gt;Seriously... Bethesda what are you doing anymore?
---
There is two reasons why what they are doing is the smart thing to do from a business perspective. 
---
1.)  They have a game that has been losing players, but they also know that a lot of original players are still around, and are willing to spend money on the game. So while a lot of people may be mad about what's happening, they do not care about those people, they only care about those that will make them money. 
---
2.)  The second reason has a little to do with this. 
---
&gt;If Fallout 76 is going to have this kind of reputation... I am afraid of what they're going to do with Elder Scrolls 6...
---
The reputation of Fallout 76 means nothing to Bethesda or players. They know that once they start talking about it people will also start talking about it and forget about 76. 
---
The best example I can think of is COD. That game constantly has a mediocre launch, they always put in loot boxes and microtransactions, and they continue to do things that make players mad. However once they announce the next game, the players move on to the new one saying this will be good. Then the cycle continues. 
---
The same thing will happen here with Fallout 76 and Elder Scrolls 6. What they do to this game literally does not matter to them because they know that people will always spend money on it, and then once the next big game from tmBethesda comes out, the players will move onto that one.
---
I admit I was dropped ammo.
---
The game is run out of thier Austin Studio which was freshly aquired. Re-used old assets etc. It' an experiment thier not losing anything. Also a lot of companies would love to be worth 2.5B. Anyway you look at it that's a lot of money and they're one of the largest video game companies out there. 
---
But yeah this will do them in. Sure.
---
Already on it and loving it. Only have an hour in, but I'll sink some time in this weekend. See you in r/outerworlds!
---
It's really saddening AAA titles are not what it's used to be anymore. If they don't deliver a masterpiece, people immediately shit on them. You gotta bring at least GTA5 quality to qualify as a good game nowadays. There's no honor, there's no money, it's a wonder how some of these developers are still sticking with AAA titles while it does them no good
---
That is good to hear
---
Hey guys just a friendly reminder that China has some nice natural landscapes, ignore the (what you consider) bad stuff :)
---
Same - did they add it as a reward for this event?
---
thank you so much! it is appreciated!!!!!
---
Well, thanks SickDreyke for sparing me time i would waste on talking with support. Cherrs.
---
No. By my logic the fridge should be free and the repair and scrap boxes should be earned through weekly challenges or similar, or do not be a thing at all.
---
The Atomic Shop should be what it was at the begginning. Cosmetic-only.
---
I think everyone knows when they were taking about all DLC would be free they were talking about expansions.
---
should we create an r/fo76breakups ?
---
People are charging caps to people to use their private servers.
---
I imagine alot more ideas like this will surface in time.
---
These private servers are pretty borderline P2W and or P2P
---
But honestly, the real problem overall is this game just needs alot of love..  and passion..
---
I'd gladly pay for a subscription of they would have shown in the last year that they care
---
I suppose we have to wait for next month to roll in, but let's say them not stacking won't be doing Bethesda any favours right now.
---
That's actually very handy
---
I also payed full price. heck, I pre-ordered. Something I NEVER have done before and probably never will again.
---
I think op means that mostly constructive criticism/feedback until the 23rd
---
Was that suppose to be an insult? Loool
---
Thought you were quitting?
---
Ok brilliant thanks for the info
---
Oh shit, I'm way behind my next scheduled post.
---
I've been here since beta. It's overwhelmingly negative. Yeah there's some people who defend everything but it's no doudt 95 percent negative. And has been since launch.
---
Apparently nothing is free because business. Also, what a person advertises and promises when marketing a product means nothing because of "risks"
---
‚ÄúLethal force engaged!‚Äù
---
I understand, but functionality is different than a glitch. Not one session I had was uninterrupted by a server disconnect with FO76. To me those are fatal game flaws that should have been ironed out upon release, with SaaS activations at least there‚Äôs not as much pull on server uptime because DRM checks require minimum effort.
---
Do you have a link to them saying the original business model is no longer viable? I havent been following this game for a while so I must've missed it!
---
Also, you seem to be making a lot of passive aggressive assumptions about me based on a very basic question I had. Money isn't much of an issue for me if you must know, and I'll leave it at that.
---
&gt; Please tell me what you think DLC stands for? Because for most people, locking "Downloadable Content" behind a paywall counts as Paid DLC. That is literally the definition.
---
New missions/quests, new maps, new game modes (no, private server doesn't count as a game mode - its adventure mode).  
---
But, wait, I thought the claim was that FO76 is just FO3/NV/FO4 that they're reselling to us piece by piece with online play?  So wouldn't that mean that all the content is in the game already, and technically not DLC?  
---
&gt; How much does Bethesda pay you people to spout this garbage?
---
Wait, Bethesda is paying people to share their experiences and views of the game?  Where can I get in on that?
---
&gt; And yes, I thoroughly believe that in game mechanics and items like the "Scrapper Tent" and "Unlimited Storage" count as "game content".
---
Single iitems/objects with no in game storyline, quest, etc to go with it.  Sounds like a microtransaction to me, not something people would define as DLC...
---
Bummer
---
Yes. But if anyone on my friends list did that to me, I'd remove and block them.
---
They did lie about cosmetics only, too. Those are lies. You call it "expanding service" for some reason, lol... no, those are lies. Scam. People trusted their words and they lied. Its called scamming. Not that hard, lol...
---
Scout hat squirrel??
---
How often do bend over and grab your ankles? 
---
Why support them when they are making a shit product
---
That stripped-down interpretation is clearly not what Hines said.
---
Yeah, but that's because modding right now currently amounts to modifying the compressed archives. Actual modding would let us load new content without it being glued to the side of pre-existing content.
---
Don't understand why people have to be dicks about it. Just sharing my experience. Fingers crossed Outer Worlds isn't a let down
---
For the record, Fallout 76 does not have 450 players on Xbox. That is the number of user reviews from which the star rating (3/5) was calculated. You can easily see it varies wildly between games, and one higher on the list often has a lower number than another below it, so it is obviously not the active player count.
---
I'll find it for ya and yea this game is one of em theres no monthly fee its optional. Let me ask you this since it seems outlandish for Beth to charge for private servers. What's the difference between fallout 1st and minecraft realms?
---
Yeah that's really where my train of thought went when I think of how modding would come to 76 if it does at all. They've created a condition where they control the game - with the always online "live service" guff - now they just need to figure out a way to make people pay for the privilege of having fun in it after they've already bought it.
---
Putting mods exclusively to private servers and making people pay to be able to access private servers seems like a logical series of steps to making that happen. Though as you said, it's not working out for them.
---
Honestly I'd just love to be a fly on the wall during these board meetings where they're brainstorming this stuff. Like... really, who thought charging people 100 dollars for a subscription for a game that was already build on a foundation of lies and mortared with more bugs than any Bethesda game to date was a good idea?
---
You are the kind of person who when amazon decided they were no longer going to only sell books would try and bring a lawsuit aren‚Äôt you?
---
I'm just saying, there is an advantage to lag free, A single player Appalachia would be fun, even more so when it's modded.  I think people would have made some very neat dynamics that Bethesda is absolutely unwilling to implement.  The online 24 makes everything they do like stepping on eggshells and walking on thin ice.  On top of that the monitization is often egregious for things that are slightly interesting.
---
My time with FO76 has not been terribly plagued with bugs. Server disconnects haven‚Äôt been super common (a couple nuke-based ones early on). A few visual bugs. No missing items, no missions or quests I couldn‚Äôt complete. I‚Äôve played on both PC and PS4, and possibly I‚Äôm just very lucky.
---
&gt;Especially since Bethesda said that they can‚Äôt increase the stash size due to server stability
---
The problem is not, nor has it ever been, scrap. A simple search of FO76 will validate this. The server doesn't care if you have 1 screw or 10K screws, it takes exactly the same amount of memory to address and store. 
---
As an answer to to your question on server setting, no, the player cannot, at least for now, make any changes whatsoever to the private world. It's just...private.
---
Ask for a $100 prepaid visa
---
In my case it removed the explosive effect and I was left with a Bloddied RW Pump and a Twoshot Rw Pump which should be an impossible combination ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,at the very least be glad you have the explosive still
---
Since most game publishers don't announce their units sold, unless they are trying to brag, sales estimates are usually based on what is published by the sellers. Barring figures released for opening weekends and what not this generally means it accounts for returns.
---
I too am putting FO76 On Hold and have stored it in the Uninstall Game Bin.  I highly doubt anything will change to bring it back out of the depths of shitty game hell.
---
People like you really are the death of gaming. I genuinely don't understand how someone can be such a complete moron and be proud of it.  
---
You literally made a post about how you're proud of the fact that you're being taken advantage of. It's mind boggling. My mind is having an extremely hard time processing how much of a complete moron you are. 
---
It's like when you meet those people being taken advantage of by ponzi schemes who think they're geniuses. Or meet someone who overpaid for a product that was garbage and is too stubborn to just admit they made a mistake, so they go around defending that product forever. 
---
My mind just can't process the fact that there are people like you out there. People who are proud of being taken advantage of, and defend those that are taking advantage of them.
---
A Fleshlight of positivity.
---
Well, I don't have to pay extra to play Minecraft by myself.
---
Is this just a theory or were you actually able to prove this?
---
It's common for game companies to be developing multiple games at the same time, but not every game or update gets delayed. You could say that the delay was probably for The Elder Scrolls Blades or The Elder Scrolls 6, but there's nothing to backs those claims up
---
You think 4k people are 1% of the playerbase? How many people do you think play this game exactly?
---
Not sure but his wife can cook a dinner! Pretty sweet getting double back every month what the price of admission is. I'm not sure who is fucking whoü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
It's kind of funny how everyone seems to think that businesses should just hemorrhage content without making anything from it to pay the bills for that content. I'm considering the subscription simply because of the folks talking about the reduced lag from the smaller amount of users on the private servers. That's actually pretty perfect for what I prefer to play FO76 as - co-op Fallout with my SO - as lag issues are the main reason she doesn't like to play right now. I'd even be perfectly fine with private server characters being locked to private servers and not allowed to jump back to public or NW servers because of that - which we'll probably end up seeing when modding the private servers becomes allowed.
---
None of that says I don't have problems with the game. I do. None of that says I don't have issues with utility items in the Atom Shop. I *definitely* do. But I've been expecting a subscription service since they said "always free DLC" because they've got to pay for the new content *some*how and a subscription service is a pretty obvious way to do it.
---
The number of people in this thread doing mental gymnastics to basically defending this subscription is wild. This is why they keep pushing these things out. I blame the player base. Also, the people that got the subscription are..SHOCKED that the private servers are riddled with bugs.  
---
people also forgetting they originally said they could not increase inventory space by much cause of a technical restriction? Guess what? You can. But with money. 
---
This is considered a DLC. DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT.
---
I was looking at greed fall as well! But chose outer worlds, and i grabbed vampyre cuz it was 20 bucks and I liked the look of the atmosphere and such. Thanks, man. Ill probably switch back and forth a bit until one of them sucks me in.
---
I wish there was a way to display the hours played on here fed directly from the launcher or something.
---
Oh good! Idk that it will really be a problem for me right now. I only have a small friends list. But there are some people I've met in game that maybe I don't want them to just join me whenever I want. 
---
I hope you enjoy outer Worlds as well! I'm thinking about picking it up this weekend
---
nope, im done with this conversation,  if you havent played in a while, why do you care. 
---
sounds like someone pulling a dupe exploit. Are you on PC?
---
I think with 76 theyre steering towards a new player base in the multiplayer realms. Sorry for all u fo3 N/V f04 players but this is a new style game not necessarily aimed at you. What little 76 i played due to lack of good connection i can say they did a great job. I'm sure theyll come out with another solo game in the coming years. Signed a fellow fallout loving neckneard.
---
I never played by but my co worker said don‚Äôt believe the negativity and try it for yourself. No thanks lol
---
I like the sound of that, a one night special. I don‚Äôt pvp and my build isn‚Äôt built to take anyone on. But it would be fun just for a night and there was no fear of losing treasured crap. Hey I even got killed by a swarm of Stingeings and I‚Äôm level 280, so I‚Äôd have no chance.
---
You are the kind of person that people describe in here a lot. Beaten wife Syndrome.
---
Dude, this is literally affecting the game and what comes out. 
---
\- You have to pay for the camp site (which we, on this subreddit, posted about wanting)
---
\- You have to buy the NCR Ranger outfit (which we, on this subreddit, posted about wanting)
---
\- You have to pay for unlimited stash (which we, on this subreddit, posted about wanting)
---
These things probably would have been free content updates, BUT because of the problem that OP posted, they instead put it behind a paywall.
---
Anyone defending this, and or not seeing it affecting the trajectory of the game (as this game is supposed to evolve) is being delusional.
---
When everywhere you turn reviews are universally bad, finding a place with mixed reviews and optimism in spite of the admitted glaring flaws looks like a fucking beacon of positivity.
---
Ok well you dont have to in 76 either? Dont interact with other players or be the first one to spawn in a world
---
But...but...it's not "content" because I don't think its important enough! So if something isn'tg ood enough to be content then its okay to charge for!
---
...I mean...what?
---
No I‚Äôm on PS4. Even for duping the items are in paperbags right?
---
I also hate 76 but is it better for us to just not buy the shit by listening to reviews or to have the government who understands the industry about as well as the CEOs of the companies we would be targeting regulate it. 
---
Im not trying to stop the regulation im just saying trading one master for another isn't my preferred solution. Its really just a shame that no one does research or people less in tune with the hobby will just buy whatever.
---
You can only use "clearly" to describe what was stated - no balancing issues or new content locked behind a for-pay structure. Can't argue with the clarity of a direct quote. You're just guessing intent and giving cover.
---
Oh yeah definitely an inconvenience I didn't know you still showed up
---
Maybe they actually used them and then disarmed them
---
You get what is effectively a solo shard, where you can invite up to 7 friends to play (or any friends can join on you, whether you want them to or not, according to what I've read).  It's not a standalone server or even a static world.  Once you log out, the world closes (with a bit of notice if there are friends in there with you).
---
So it's not a persistent world like you could have if you rented a server to host it, it's still the same as any other 76 world, just restricted on who can access it.  It's still quieter, fewer people eating up the server resources, so lag and such will be reduced.  But once you leave, the world is gone (so you can't, for instance, farm resource piles or workshops when you're offline).
---
We just want our voice to be heard. 
---
We didnt get any of the content we were promised so we have to make out own i guess
---
Dude relax. None of this is a big deal. How is your experience any leas fun today than it was a week ago? Not only that you have a lot of incorrect facts, like being able to carry unlimited ammo.
---
No idea.
---
It could have been a glitch, just don't know.
---
In Minecraft I can have an entire world to myself for free.
---
Edit: and it wont reset when I leave. I can also edit every aspect of the world to my liking. for free.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt be a bad idea actually...
---
I was... hesitant at the online only capacity of the game. After all Fallout 4 was still fun for me before the modding scene took off like it did.
---
It was when they re-introduced gear durability that they lost my sale. The most annoying aspect of Fallout 3 and New Vegas was how my stuff was always falling apart. High end late game gear needing to be repaired so frequently it was just easier to carry around a more common shitty gun because I would find repair fodder for it everywhere.
---
And they said you could only repair your gear back at your base? You'd already lost my sale at the point where you said I had to repair my stuff period but I have to stop what I'm doing to do it? Yeah, hard deal breaker for me
---
Everyone wants Private servers , and they asked for it many times , as most ppl also asked for more inventory space in the start.
---
It's very diferent stating that than : "I would pay for X"
---
I'm just stating a fact here , you had a comunity doing this all the time, everytime I tried to come back and came to this reddit I read things like this : " I would pay if X and Y " , every plea for a feature would contain someone going " I would pay for this ! "
---
And now you complain they are selling you stuff ? For me honestly the Fallout76 comunity with all it's excuses since launch and with their constant " I would pay for X" just got what it asked for, now they have another cashgrab that they can create some excuse , the community isn't doing that just because they really went overboard :D
---
And even now I see ppl "If it worked I would pay" ... and your surprised they are asking money for basic stuff that should be implemented since start ?
---
This subreddit was never a beacon of positivity, it's bipolar and just as toxic. I suggest Bethesda look for other sources of feedback than this fucking mess of a subreddit.
---
That would be cool
---
Private worlds (at this current time) are identical to public worlds but only up to 8 friends can join. The day they bring paid mods to private only worlds I would call it DLC.
---
The outfit is coming to the atomic shop (or a very close variant of it) and aquarding to Bethesda that dosent count because you can earn atoms in game for free.
---
QoL stuff like the unlimited junk storage and the Tent. Yea I would consider them to be small DLC items that should have been either in the base game or the atomic shop at least.
---
&gt;ok ty but still not one example how this can screw up someone else game experience. i mean 1st dont do 10% more damage or something like that what would fit in your category.
---
Are you trolling? I just gave you a bunch of very specific examples and you just answer "*still not one example*"???
---
&gt;having games made less enjoyable? so this is pure emotion? the game is less enjoyable for you because there are 2-3 things you could have, if you buy it, but you dont want, because its for money? i still dont get it.
---
It has nothing to do with emotions. Features that should be in the game are missing from the game, because they decided to sell them instead. The game is *objectively* worse because of it.
---
&gt;i mean whatever you did before in this game you still can?
---
You mean play an incomplete game that's lacking basic features? Yeah I did that before because I thought they would fix those things eventually.
---
You don't seem to grasp the simple concept that games need to be improved over time, because they have problems and those problems start to reduce the quality of experience over time. When companies start to sell the improvements instead of just adding them to the game, it means they make the game worse. How is that so hard to understand?
---
Aybe it's Zenimax, but elder scrolls online doesn't have these problems. You get more playing that game for free than you get from a fo76 subscription. They regularly come out with updates and add loads of content. It has a strong player base that aren't leaving in droves. And it's run by Zenimax.
---
As long as people are playing they'll continue to support it imo
---
Lmao hell no just keep playing like you have don‚Äôt have other people tell you what to enjoy.
---
Question do people you invite have to be a premium member or only the host?
---
Yeah, they started adding Squirrel stuff in patch 14 :)
---
It kinda is. Tekken used to be my fighting game since i was 3. The franchise got destroyed by corporal greed. I played fallout 2 as a kid as well and its always sad seeing your childhood games ruined because of greed.
---
I wouldnt even be here if they made that scrapbox for everyone.
---
No it isn't, and as mentioned a lot of factors are involved.
---
But whenever I plant a mine it‚Äôs the same position with the glow dot on top, this looked literally like someone emptied a bag of those so the positions were all over the place, some actually stood on the edge as if they rolled then stopped.
---
You're dodging my original question. As a subscription based service what's the difference between them? Is Mojang greedy for charging what they do with realms? Because with your logic they are since you can play solo anyway

Not just a little suspension either. Any negative thought rewards you with a 30 day ban.

That place is not just drinking the Kool Aid, they are drowning in it.

---
All passion, no citations. I give this essay a C+.
---
That's a pretty self-defeating mentality you have there. Someone is interested in the game who hasn't played in a while: "go away".
---
Are we paying for balancing now also, must have missed that. You are guessing intent as well. When most people refer to ‚ÄúDLC‚Äù they are referring to expansions. This is how the phrase DLC is used. When someone says all DLC is free, that is what they mean. Colloquially DLC=expansions.
---
There are no season passes or paid DLC (expansions).
---
The fact that he explicitly says season passes in the same sentence as DLC further explains how he was talking about expansions. Season passes are when you buy all future DLC/expansions. 
---
Edited: for clarity.
---
It's a company, not a nonprofit organisation. That's capitalism...
---
The fact that you‚Äôre getting downvoted just proves your point more.
---
Honestly the game isn't even worth defending when you'll just get downvoted to hell by the bipolar opinions of this subreddit. I just do it because at least people will know not everybody hates this game.
---
Sorry that you don't understand the "only cosmetic" concept. It's fine, man, not everyone can be at the same level.
---
Pirate costume is badass and gives me a reason to use a black powder pistol... If only they gave us a saber that went with it from that time period
---
At this point, I'm not looking forward to more Bethesda games. I've played every single fallout and elder scrolls game totalling probably 5000 hours over the last decade and a half. I don't NEED more. There are good games coming out all the time and better companies to support.
---
exactly WHAT is your argument here so we are both on the same page?
---
Srsly nothing's changed except all these maniacs going apeshit in this subreddit telling everyone that fallout is doomed. Tbh server stability's better than ever and we got Halloween event coming soon. Chill the fuk out
---
Based on what? The demand of a minor part of the playerbase?
---
Thanks for posting this btw OP! See ya at the next datamine ama
---
The amount of cringe I felt from this comment is off the charts.
---
EDIT: Holy shit your entire post history is comments like this.
---
Thanks for the clarification! üòÅ
---
Massive disappointment, no new masks? Halloween weapons? Crazy costumes? Not even worth getting on to do unfortunately
---
There are fallout 76 subs that have restrictions on negative posts. This however is 1 of the only places that people can truly voice their anger and Bethesda sees it.
---
Its not sure that it will make a difference, but it's honestly the best chance. Power in numbers, this is closest thing to a protest that people can do. If you'd prefer the oppression of people voicing their opinion then there are other subs for you.
---
It's discussion of fallout 76, for good or... very... very bad.
---
So it's not on the Top 40 list?
---
Come on, prove my point.
---
Well, a libertarian, economically,  is a person who thinks the market would be best if it  determines the value of labor, products, and ethics in business without an outside regulatory body or rules that govern its freedom of choice. Your comment seemed to be mocking any negative response by insinuating that they are free to do what they like and shouldnt have to hear the response because, hey, they need to make money right? I disagreed, and mocked what seemed to be your position as a response. Now its clear you just said something because you wanted to, not because it made any sense.
---
Im not sure the higher ups will let them.
---
Keep clinging to that despite knowing he was listing things and that was only one of them. That's the beauty of a clear quote.
---
I backed the game through all the poor decisions, up until this last patch. I also uninstalled last night. It's sad but there are other games being managed better... So I'll focus on those for now and maybe some day come back.
---
They did mention CAMP budget increases, actually.  
---
&gt;Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop persistence.

---
I feel your pain. But this latest disaster is just so... bizarre.  I  mean it's not just greed.  It does seem to me that the people running Bethesda have just completely lost their minds.  Fallout 1st isn't just scummy  monetization practices.  It just doesn't make any damn sense. There's something about it  that's just so... downright insane.
---
Not getting the scrap bug nor the no privacy Private world. Either the bugs are made up to cause fire and destruction or they are very specific in nature. But the character I used to check the private server etc still has her junk in the scrap box. Same with my main character, which makes me wonder if people are making up stuff up just to wind people up.
---
As far as my impression, its worth it if you play alot and have friends. Makes it easier to get stucff done, find plans etc than have to constantly deal with RNG of looters having passed through.
---
Makes it easier and less laggy for doing Scorche queen stuff etc. But overall its just an option that doesn't really make a giant difference, Bethesda still can track what you do etc and exploiting on them is the same as doing it in the public, you'll eventually be noticed etc.
---
The only main thing is the Atoms make it worth it, since basicly your basicly buying atoms and getting your own private place etc.
---
But I haven't experienced any of the issues the loud complainers are screaming about.. *shrugs*
---
But it's something that isn't needed or required.
---
Edit: With Bethesda admiting the bug, still haven't experienced it so maybe theres a weight limit glitch or an item specific to the cause.
---
A tesla glitched me yesterday without even killing me first. I then proceeded to defend my camp and chase after the other team's glitched member with my bleedout syringer. Haha
---
Meaning this sincerely, it does sound like you are more fortunate. Playing on PS4, I have experienced all of that and not just once. As just a misc task, when I did try to give it a second chance a couple months ago, I couldn‚Äôt pick up one of the two items to solve a murder mystery (near Grafton). It told me where it was, it was just not visible for me to pick up, I signed off and on and it was the same. I‚Äôve killed a few legendary enemies to have their bodies disappear and the loot with it after burning through hundreds of rounds I crafted from scrap that took hours to build. Even playing in the lower end of July, August and beginning of September I was disconnected more than I was at launch. 
---
I did checks on PS4 MTU, and WiFi jitter/loss and that isn‚Äôt the problem. Other MMO games run fine so then this FO 1st news comes and it‚Äôs rather hard to look at this and call it a deal or even worth the cost when there‚Äôs so many other problems happening.
---
Wait what?! Are there additional quests??
---
It was never marketed as s sub mmo...they shouldve started as sub if they wanted to pull this shiz.
---
Imo they should've just made a Fallout 4 online game. It could've been included with the season pass or just a separate digital only purchase. Then the story/setting/characters/etc. of 76 could've just been used for the next single player Fallout game.
---
Mad because I blocked you off on my server aren't you
---
I am totally a consumer of 76, I bought the game lol. And I even purchased something cosmetic from the atom store that I thought was reasonably priced
---
What I absolutely refuse to do is pay for a subscription based service that is so horribly overpriced and for content that was mostly promised to be in the base game. For people who enjoy the game, they can either go to the rainbow sub or simply continue about their day playing the game. Anyone who enjoys/supports/defends the subscription quite honestly has all the downvoted and dissent coming.
---
Just my thoughts. If something is terrible and bound to not stop, ravage the community and the creators to get it to stop.
---
With well over a million copies sold I'd say a whole lot more than 4000....
---
Fair enough I'm just saying these people payed 100 dollars to play without griefers in workshops it would be a shame if they weren't even safe there ... &gt;:)
---
Since you edited your comment, ill add to it.
---
I never said you could carry unlimited ammo, i said you can make unlimited ammo. You dont have to go out once in a while and farm items to get ammo, you just spend a few hours grinding them endlessly and youre good to go. 
---
Its part of the item management i was talking about. So even if i did buy 1st class, item management will be less fun.
---
How is your experience any less fun than it was a week ago..
---
Yes, I pay, so it wouldnt impact my game at all. 
---
Is this selfish, yes it is. 
---
So is human nature.
---
you might have ben hit by the guy thats trying to get back at bathesda by killing peoples spawns on their freinds only worlds
---
I uninstalled when they did the fridge as I foresaw the direction they were going.  But I always held out hope because despite the hate I love fallout and always wanted to really really jump into this game.  No more
---
Yea it‚Äôs very strange to see them just laying there.
---
Read what he was responding to. Context matters.
---
Appreciate the feedback cheers mate appreciate it.
---
At this point they're worse than EA in my opinion. Not even EA falsely advertises.
---
Why would they be scared? They already made a bunch of money with people buying into their microtransactions.  They couldnt care less about this game, but people keep paying more money for it.
---
Yeah some of these replies, to be honest, should not be too surprising. I also am not gonna get into it with any of them either. They added the monthly benefits to call it a membership so they can get away with releasing private servers and not consider it a 'DLC'.
---
Downloaded it but didn't get to start it yet but that sounds great. I actually mod vats out of fallout 4 and replace it with the bullet time mod every time now.
---
at this point i agree
---
They could do that but people higher on the ladder then Bethesda themselves are pushing for constant revenue what‚Äôs not possible with single player model
---
They do block camps, i placed one to troll my friend and his base was blocked. It also cost nothing to move. So players will be moving it whenever its convenient.
---
to be fair private servers are usually not free.  but be nice if you know it actually WORKED right.  
---
lol.  "you and 7 friends" yeah the problem is they didnt specify WHICH of those 7 friends....
---
I'm not dodging your question. You asked the difference between this and Minecraft. I told you. The difference is that I don't have to pay to play completely by myself. I also get to edit the world how I want, and it won't reset when I leave.
---
And also, I don't have to pay Mojang for a multiplayer server. To my knowledge realms is meant to be an option for people who don't know how to manage their own server. People have been making minecraft servers long before realms was a thing
---
I see what you did there. Fairly on-the-nose
---
Boot status: Licked.
---
My argument stated clearly on the start of this is that this sentence you said : 
---
"the ONLY reason I would even consider getting a sub would be true PRIVATE servers."
---
Is the reason why the game is being monetized right now ! 
---
Because you would consider getting a sub , they are selling you one !
---
There is a big diference between " I want this game to be good" and "I would consider giving more money IF X " , especially when it's a thing that will only affect you ( thus p2w/QoL being sold in cash shop ).
---
If you would consider paying it , you are the reason it exists.
---
Right, and that was kind of the first sign of this mentality. However, there was no real hard signs that toxic monetization policy was crossing over into multiplayer games specifically at the time. Games like Halo, Gears of War, etc. still had all their unlockables completely free like any other game. 
---
Other than MMOs, there wasn‚Äôt much indication of this ‚ÄúGames as a service‚Äù toxic BS that we‚Äôre seeing in modern gaming. I don‚Äôt even think it was popular in mobile games at that point.
---
Well clearly you are the one confused lol. I knew from the beginning all future DLC/expansions were free. That is still my expectation. Any stupid stuff in the shop or a voluntary atom/private server subscription don‚Äôt impact me at all or take anything away from my experience. I‚Äôm not missing out on anything.
---
Kinda reminds me of fallout 4 meets borderlands
---
I'm mad about the stash lie.
---
The tech problems aren't insurmountable, but sending out gigabytes worth of assets at a time to everyone who connects to a modded server is going to cost them a lot of bandwidth, which costs money, and they're looking for short term profits to raise the value of their company, not to spend more money. They're not going to significantly raise their overhead to undermine their own cash shop. That's not remotely their MO with this game.
---
Or keep playing, don't buy anything and use the free atoms to get stuff. You already bought the game, they are laughing at you if you think uninstalling does anything. Continuing to play and just using the free atoms annoys them alot more.
---
But those game companies have thousands of developers, while Bethesda only have like 400. Thats barely enough to even make an open world game these days, and Bethesda have to make and update 3 of them at the same time!
---
As long as people that play are ok with the bugs and spend money in game it will be fine... But if people are done with being slapped in the face and stop spending there money then it will end. That's my opinion. It's probably wrong tho. I know some one will have something to say.
---
I need that David S Pumpkins suit
---
Literally everyone I know that plays regularly approved of both the fridge/scrapbot and fallout 1st
---
I was holding out to buy it until private servers and mod support came out. Now private servers are locked behind a subscription, and still nothing on mods.
---
Quoting Hines, not you. Nice try.
---
So, nice responses and I would like to respond to a few...Crashes,  these are probably not true dedicated worlds or servers but when i get on my world (as I call it)....i do not have several or many things such as 20 or more other CAMPS that include all of their items, dupers, exploits such as building CAMPS under the map, etc. etc......all of these exist and all of these cause server or map instability....So, yes my world is more stable because of this........  Again, you can gripe all you want about the money saying "I am not getting what I pay for", how in the fuck do you determine what I value in this game or life in general?  Just because YOU do not think it is worth it does not sway my thought about it.... $100 per year?  I spent that last night playing poker and drinking beer let alone get a year's worth of fun out of it...  As far the stash box and stating that they could not do it in the past because of server instability?  I am not sure, maybe the way the new stashes are set up (you cannot store bulk scrap in them) they do not eat up as much space or what space they eat up does not affect the servers because they are stored in different manner??  I am no tech wizard but I think they figured it out somehow and maybe that somehow cost them more money so they are charging for it?  I do not know for sure but i really do not care...$12 does not affect my life,,,And most people on here will go spend 6 dollars on a coffee or 4 dollars on a RedBull and piss that out an hour later but bitch about the $12 to add some quality to your entertainment.
---
I'm not so quick to shove ALL the blame on Bethesda, I feel like zenimax could be mostly at fault for the atom shop and subscription, that seems like something that was pushed out into the game rather than something they actually wanted
---
Id take gameplay over dialogues any days.
---
Simple man. Who cares lately?
---
Knowing that if my favourite mode survival ever comes back, OP guys will be even more OP and can go on an endless rampage. 
---
In survival, a level 140 was fighting me and my friend but we lasted long enough until he ran outta ammo and we blasted him, that was hilarious, but now their inventory will be nothing but ammo and stimpaks, no need to manage scrap anymore.
---
&gt;i have still full acces to the entire game, except i don't

Thanks for letting everybody know.im sure you‚Äôll be missed.
---
I'm interested to see how someone recreates the Pumpkin House as their camp.
---
So various rotting pumpkins like the ones outside pumpkin house, a firebreather uniform, whitespring overalls and one new thing introduced ( pirate costume) that isn't just ripped from the assets of the game.
---
The event seems worthwhile doing /s, also y would've thought the event would have been at the pumpkin house and not whitesprings
---
I love the people who are downvoting all the "agree" comments. 
---
"Fuck this hypothetical gameplay event! I hate all these people talking about it! I'd hate to hypothetically pvp in this made-up scenario!"
---
Yong Yea has a successful gaming channel with over a million subscribers. Recently moved to LA to work in a job field he actually loves doing. Is only rising in popularity and one day will most likely be one of the most influential voices of gaming media (barring extreme circumstances). 
---
The two of you are defending a game and a company whose sole purpose right now is to separate your money from your wallet. A company who is laughing AT YOU, not with YOU. 
---
Your denial of how you're being taken advantage and your defense of those taking advantage of you is just flat out depressing now.
---
I really like that WS Jumpsuit
---
lol thats funny
---
Exactly.  I hear everyday from this sub that "76 is a buggy mess. Full of disconnects". I think I've had 3 disconnects in 3 months and I'm positive 1 was my internet. 
---
Imo I think they've done a great job at fixing things.  Sure they added more bugs when fixing others. But for the most part I think they've done decent. 
---
The only real problem im having now is im kinda bored.  Most of my teammates moved on to other things, life, etc. I'm just hoping wastelanders is the shit.
---
Scrap box: meh? You must be kidding.
---
So because the content isn't good enough to be considered DLC, then it's okay to charge for it?
---
Judging by the backlash on this sub I doubt you knew the majority of the playerbase.
---
Most likely that premium came because they were already struggeling.
---
I dont see things getting better with things like outer words and rdr2  Getting released just when they messed it up again. And when wastelanders is coming there will be Cyberpunk 77.
---
I  dont think there is even much interest from their side to turn it around if the money is not right and i dont see this improving.
---
For the first time i actually agree with all the people shitting on the game.
---
Online almost every day since beta and not logged in since the update. Downloading outer worlds atm..
---
You still hve to farm everything you need to make ammo. Same as you did before... I am failing to see your point. It‚Äôs not like you can carry any extra materials.
---
So don‚Äôt buy 1st if you are worried about item management lol. You are complaining about something you don‚Äôt even want.
---
Starfield isnt that the game where one of its microtransaction deals the legatus pack is $27,000?
---
I sent a ticket in to the customer support saying that I want the features that were promised to be free (private server, scrap-box, and tent thing) and if I don't receive them free of charge I will be filing a complaint with the Nebraska Attorney General. It's been nearly 2 days now with no response.
---
lol losers
---
Are you blind? The ‚Äúbandwagon outrage shit‚Äù has been around since launch and will never disperse.
---
The stash box and tent are merely ANOTHER reason to trash the game and developers.
---
YOU are part of the problem.
---
The amount of bootlicking in this thread...just wow. Yeah, OP you're right. The proof is in the replies.
---
*Watches the whales splashing out in their own doo-doo-water as they mock everyone else for not wanting to pay $100 to play in their doo-doo-water*
---
Yes please you handful of salty brats turn it off and find another game and forum.
---
The next expansion should be named ‚ÄúFO76 - Forum wasteland‚Äù and take place here...:I mean it did go nuclear on Oct 23rd.
---
Goooood grief.
---
Please downvote this reply if you‚Äôre still literally shaking.
---
Nah bro that should be free or a 1 time fee of like 5 bucks but most likely free
---
If you a a vendor owner with lots of stock this is problematic due to high traffic areas now having twice as likely chance to have a base/small camp now. Also users can place thier camp in high traffic areas to prevent others from having bases.
---
Not yet :(  - They started adding the infrastructure though like rewards and a few other mentions too
---
They aren't the playerbase lol. People are literally joining just to shit on the game
---
Ah, you mean the one where people are getting banned for voicing their opinions on Fallout 1st?  Yeah, I think you meant r/circlejerk
---
&gt;There‚Äôs always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it‚Äôs all free after launch ‚Äì all our content, there‚Äôs no season pass and no paid DLCs.-Pete Hines
---
&gt;no season pass
---
Done, but Bethesda metrics engineers will just say however it's been temporarily stored in the Uninstall Bin, all good Boss!
---
Really? But BioWare used an automatic rifle and is still holding down the trigger.
---
I dont think its doomed.  Will there be more changes and decisions made that will send this sub into full screeching baby mode?  Absolutely.  
---
Servers are still full, and its not even the weekend yet here in the US.  I'll bet not much will change.
---
Unless you are using a gattling plasma or a gattling laser it's not worth it. Most heavy guns reload plenty fast. You're better off running bullet shield with them
---
But with the 2 I mentioned I find it worth it, since their reload time is quite long
---
wow that‚Äôs good to know! Didn‚Äôt realize I bumped into a crime scene!
---
Why are you mad at me lol? I didn't make it.
---
I've been playing since beta and this update really hasn't changed my game at all. I don't spend atoms and I don't hoard junk so having my own world to farm junk just isn't what I want to do. I keep very minimal junk and aid items in my stash. If someone wants to farm a million acid or fusion cores well then go ahead. It doesn't affect me one bit.
---
No, you are only reading part of the quote and ignoring the context.
---
A fortune??? If you think $12 is  a fortune then you have no life or live at home with mommy or maybe you are saying a fortune as in gaming terms, which is still dumb because you paid whatever you did for the game and it is a disc that cost about 2 dollars to make...
---
I remember playing in the EU the time was at 3 a.m. and 1 a.m.
---
was not really worth it but screw us EU Players I guess.
---
Do your own research, I am not here to do it for you. 
---
Its not my responsibility to educate you.  I am not a teacher.
---
Omg thank god someone else can see the comparison of DLC from popular games! When I was younger I would buy all those damn map packs and shit! Every damn time! A lot of this community feels like they should get everything for free. And maybe I just don‚Äôt understand that because all the games I‚Äôve played don‚Äôt give the players ‚Äúmajor‚Äù content for free. Every game I‚Äôve bought, just about, Ive bought knowing that in 6 months I was going to have to fork out another 20-30 bucks to get all the cool stuff. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a no brainer by no means I just think people need to think about the concept a little more realistically.
---
So wait, the 'Free States Revolutionary' counts as a costume for the Halloween event?
---
I wasn‚Äôt saying I was possibly lucky to be flippant, I know those bugs have happened for other people, just not for me. Which, to be pragmatic about the whole thing, probably means they aren‚Äôt happening for ‚Äúmost‚Äù players.
---
Doesn‚Äôt take away from how frustrating they are for the players they do happen to. I remember setting New Vegas aside many, many times because of absolutely infuriating bugs (which is why it‚Äôs extra ironic to me now that people consider the extra-extra patched and updated FNV such a better game than others in the franchise, it was not that way for a long, long time).
---
If they start bullying them they just move to their private servers and problem volved, no assholes there!
---
Yea I understand.  But if 95% leave and the game shuts down then they kinda did tell me what to enjoy haha.
---
But in all seriousness,  I hope WLs turns it around.
---
Then you are a fool, and it makes me wonder how often you are parted from your money.
---
There was never a slope. This was the plan from day one. The moment the game was announced as online only with no solo or private mode it was pretty obvious this was the route it would take. Their biggest mistake was not being upfront about it. People would have been over it by now and the game would probably be in a better state.
---
They didn't falsely advertise the books or shows though.
---
If you haven't noticed suddenly in the past few hours there's been a surge of users defending Bethesda with what little logic they can scrape together. Looks like their social media team is astroturfing because it doesn't look organic at all.
---
How will they be more OP in survival? Do you carry scrap on your person? I‚Äôve never done that... this is a bit of stretch here.
---
I had to drop many fatmans, rockets etc because of weight limit. 800 is not a lot. It will be once scrap is outta the way. 
---
Its not hard to see the major advantages 1st class players have over second. And that for 15 dollars a month? Please... just Think about all the benefits and it should be clear as day on how second class players are screwed.
---
Trash rewards
---
Of course, it's not your responsibility, but it is part of the purpose of this sub. So I guess it's just odd that you chimed in the first place, then got offended as though you weren't expecting this.
---
MODUS became self-aware and is destroying Bethesda from within.
---
There's very few properly flat spots in Appalachia. The game needs to either flatten the land moreso when trying to place predefined things like the sex tent, or they need to add more.
---
There's a reason why most camps are vying for the same space, there's very little usable flat ground.
---
I don't take issue with the tent in general, travelling around the map is way easier now than it was at launch thanks to Vending Machines. Workshops you own can also be travelled to for free, FYI.
---
Something is wrong in your head bro. I knew this game will be a scam(pay to win garbage), long before launch. Also I got out more enjoyment from this game than Witcher 3 by youtubers like Jim Sterling, and I didn't even buy the game nor played it. It was hilarious to see Bethesda destroying it's reputation.
---
Why is it called the "Practice Jack-O-Lantern"?  Just a test carving?  Or is it a reference to something?  Never knew what it was supposed to be.
---
Keep meat riding opinions that aren‚Äôt your own üï∫
---
And they still said they wouldn't do a paid subscription service.
---
I would believe so if there was a single post defending Bethesda that made it to the top. 
---
I doubt anyone would lose their time joining to a sub of a game they don't have.
---
People shouldn‚Äôt be putting tents in high traffic areas though. I imagine it would make sense to have in the wilderness where there aren‚Äôt fast travel locations nearby
---
You make good points. I don't think full on regulation is the answer. Just guards for obvious tone deaf predatory business practices. If people really look at all the things Bethesda has done starting even with the initial promotion of the game (ex: 16 times the detail) **in the aggregate** it is all way out there.
---
The perks aren't minor. Unlimited junk storage is an enormous change to the game state. 
---
If a mature adult says there won't be any seasons passes and we won't sell power, they would be bound by that statement. Excepting people to honor their word isn't unreasonable.
---
I'm really interested in this "hope you learned your lesson/hope you won't make this mistake again" stance towards people who have played this game.
---
What's the lesson you hope we learned? The game is kind of fun. I've had a decent time. Might subscribe to see what it's like, might not. Who does this hurt?
---
"No, you are only reading part of the quote and ignoring *my interpretation*."
---
I've tried to join my friends in a private server but couldn't join. They had to invite me.
---
I went to a private server for a fight. Was not a good time. Haha
---
Good to know, I haven't been through whitesprings yet.
---
Wow, kinda shitty thought right there. Good thing myself and many others have cleared our list to keep that from happening
---
Yeah they kept their word. This isn‚Äôt DLC.
---
I mean, the filthy casuals guys and other diehard Bethesda fans have been enabling them to treat us like trash since the game launched.
---
I'm assuming they must get off on it.
---
&gt;There‚Äôs always going to be new content, changes in game balance, whatever it takes, and by the way, it‚Äôs all free after launch ‚Äì all our content, there‚Äôs no season pass and no paid DLCs -Pete Hines
---
That's why people are upset because they explicitly said they wouldn't be doing this shit
---
I will be adding you later today need a few guns modded!
---
Ok so they can have a few more weapons in their stash? That doesn‚Äôt help them on the battlefield lol
---
When a company screws up that bad even the inactive post/commenters are gonna rightfully complain
---
 üòÇ
---
No. I tried that. I couldn't join my friends game. They had to invite me
---
The game is repetitive at this point. You're pretty doing the same shit over and over. They need to add new obtainable items into the core game to bring back players. The new events are only a temporary satisfaction then back to the old shit again.
---
Huh, that‚Äôs odd, I‚Äôm not sure how they could get like that either
---
&gt; some even fell into the crevices between rocks that I couldn‚Äôt reach 
---
don't keep them
---
The service just released and they said that mods and administrative control over the world is coming. The only thing that resets are the workshops. You dont have to pay 76 to play solo or multiplayer. I know plenty it people that ran servers for minecraft on PC, it's not an option for console players. You're right though lets get back to your subject. How is a subscription to private servers  DLC?
---
Please
---
Sorry you couldn't convince me to believe your defeatist interpretation over the actual words from Pete Hines. No worries.
---
He is trolling Spuds, just leave him be. 
---
He is just looking to argue.
---
"yes Bethesda fuck me harder, my analogy is so perfect, please continue screwing me over"
---
That's my only real complaint.  Most of my friends moved on to other things.  Not because fallout 76. Just different interests have come out. 
---
So I'm here with maybe 4 people now.  And even tho I still log in everyday,  it is getting kinda dull.  That's why I'm hoping WLs is good.
---
Just like increased stash...oh, wait.
---
FWIW these are separate helmets sold by GameStop to the one in the collector's edition.
---
Still not great, but at least they didn't completely shit the bed on the bag *and* helmet in the collector's edition.
---
Ugh most of this is pumpkins.
---
Boy, that was sad. Still marinating in ignorance or has the stench gotten old?
---
Scrap kits scrap junk, the scrap box already does that for you. It auto scraps your junk and  stores it in the box. OP means the ability to scrap weapons and armor.
---
Ok you first.
---
You won't be.  IT is good, if you like real RPG
---
Look at Greed Fall too!  All fillers until CyberPunk in April.
---
You're right sorry for feeding him üòÇüëç
---
This could have merit.
---
What you mean nothing? Is NCR ranger outfit a joke to you? You obviously ain't a Fallout fan unlike your name suggests huehue
---
I agree, I‚Äôll admit after a few weeks i only stayed on this subreddit to see what people would say about the game, but i was amazed how some people seemed to still really love the game through all the stuff that lost so many other players. They were always politely asking for small changes and trying to start genuine discussions on mechanics and future fixes. If those people are starting to jump ship... yikes, thats really really bad.
---
I still demand to know where I can go to sign up to be paid to post on Reddit about my actual experiences in game.  
---
So, where is it?  What site?
---
No, I said x and y are equivalent. 
---
If you want to be picky, the Big Macs actually cost more than the monthly payment for an annual subscription, which further strengthens my argument.
---
nothing about the past week gives me confidence that qol features will be given free.
---
i‚Äôm honestly expecting fallout 1st ‚Äúplus‚Äù at some point
---
I recently tried making a shotgun-oriented build. Wondered if my shotgun was simply garbage. Now I'm reading this and realizing shotguns simply ARE garbage. 
---
Seriously, no matter what range I'm at, the damage isn't worth the reload time nor the firing speed. I'd rather use a hunting rifle, score a headshot, and rush them with an upgraded machete than even dick with a shotgun at this point. So disappointing.
---
Well, you always find useful things out there. Im not the most efficient person, i just have fun. I know where to get stuff, tho.
---
The more i think about it, the more i realize how lame 76 got without survival.
---
I know youre probably an Elite player, but most of us arent, alright?
---
They have been selling additional things to games forever man. Skins and different shit like that. Just don‚Äôt buy it if it‚Äôs not for you. No reason to attack people online for wanting something.
---
Someone asked you for a source and you said "Nope. Bye" basically LOLOL.
---
lol the vending machines of that camp didn‚Äôt have anything special, so I never connected the twoüòÇ
---
Reading this and seeing people say it's DLC just shows how ignorant people are ....  Seriously I don't agree with how Bethesda did this either but it is 100% not dlc.
---
I'm terrible at NW too. I only played it for the VTU rewards and stopped. I'll be doing it again to get the new stuff. Just try to get towards the center and find a bush to hide in. Can usually get top 10 if you don't engage with anyone. Have gotten top 5 many times with that strategy.
---
what about physix ? like a near explosion got them in that position
---
dont know
---
for the issue with bandwith that is paid for by the user bethesda has the costs of running the servers,they already have 2 mod stores so they already have infastructure to do it
---
They're giving the community what they asked for. Unrelenting, unshackled, unmitigated monetization that takes advantage of their goodwill and love for a brand they enjoy.
---
Yup, uninstalled this turdkey from the launcher, never going to get another title from anything associated with Zenimax and I don't care if they don't care about my decision, fuck them.
---
It would be nice if when companies lie to us like when COD promises cosmetics only every year before launch or Bethesda they were held accountable.
---
Or if they make a game that if flat out busted the stores we buy from digitally specially were required to give us our money back.
---
Stupid question. Where did you get this quote from?
---
Ok so this will sound dumb but I see a season pass and a subscription as two diferent things. A season pass is what you need to have in order to play content that season (however long that season is) where as a subscription is just giving bonuses to a player who purchases it (private servers and that junk box)
---
So by that logic private worlds should be a free option on PC if you can host it. I understand it not being a thing on consoles. That makes sense. 
---
But wait, you don't have to be Fallout 76 for a solo mode? When did they add this feature? If you mean just ignoring other players then you can say that for literally every multiplayer game without forced PvP. World Of Warcraft has a "solo mode" by this logic. 
---
You can't compare players ignoring other players to Minecraft having a literal solo mode that's free and allows for more control and freedom. As for admin privileges "coming"...they're selling the subscription now, correct? Not once the admin controls get added. 
---
As for whether this is DLC, I guess it depends on your definition of the term. Stuff that wasn't there is being added to the game. If this "stuff" was added as a free update or a paid update, what would you call that?
---
Lol I'm a wuss, playing storymode
---
That was a joke, unlike the real statements, which you are choosing to ignore.
---
Bethesda Drones in this Thread, "Hey man, how do you know the ***TASTE*** of this pile of smelly ***SHIT*** without ***eating*** it for ***yourself?*** Ha, checkmate."
---
Well since it‚Äôs a separate instance, not a DLC, they didn‚Äôt lie.
---
I don't even own the game, just here for the popcorn
---
1. Called blackboard, it's in the atomic shop for like 800 fucking atoms.
---
Yeah they did a big pass on things counting as costumes for Patch 14 \ and Mischief Night
---
Atomic shop
---
The part that says 'Don't believe Pete Hines'?
---
&gt;While I readily admit the Scrap Box and Tent are Major "Quality of Life" additions, they provide no Tactical or Competitive advantage, so where exactly are you seeing the pay to "Win" in all of this?
---
The problem isn't that these things are "pay to win."  The problem is that they are not cosmetic.   Pete Hines is on record having said the Atomic Shop would be cosmetic items only.     But the bigger problem here is how it   fits into a larger pattern.
---
For example, we were told that unlimited stash space was not possible in an online game.  Now they are telling us that it is possible.... for a fee.
---
The scrap box is something that many people think should have been part of the base game since launch but now they are charging money for it.
---
Wait until someone takes you out with a syringer &amp; mine as you're scrolling through a vendor. 
---
Well, you contra be low health for it to work, but it happens a lot on my servers. Haha
---
Well they could of promoted this if they wouldn‚Äôt have taken down survival!!!
---
They have issued many official public statements about this... and you are hanging onto the first 10 words of an old 20 word quote lol.
---
I wouldve loved to nuke some jerks but always had to consider my weight limit. That and their superior ammo supplies will definitely be in a huge advantage. 
---
Remember, im talking about casual play here, you might be one of those level 300 guys, but most of us arent.
---
But I love schadenfreude, especially the comments that poke fun of the OP's clownery lmao
---
In fact EA did a great things with bf5. And only cosmetic is only comestic.
---
yes dlc is free , we havnt had any yet that wasnt free
---
If you people had been paying attention, you'd notice that their bar for quality has been falling ever since Oblivion was released.
---
Skyrim was a fucking mess on release, we had dragons flying backwards while halfway stuck in the ground and npcs riding horses would just start flying off into the void.
---
Fallout 4 was held together with duct tape and glue, and is still stupid easy to exploit.
---
They have the reputation of Gearbox without any of the talent.
---
Sweet I don‚Äôt have any of these ... can‚Äôt wait
---
K go ahead bud!
---
A year ago people left this sub to go to r/fo76filthycasuals myself included.
---
Imagine how stupid the average person is. Half the world is dumber than that.
---
What is DLC? I've always considered it stuff that gets added to the game. They added a solo feature, private worlds, QoL fixes that in my opinion should've been in the base game, an outfit, and some other stuff. 
---
Let's say they bundled this all together for a flat price. Would that not be considered DLC?
---
Excellent, good to know I'm halfway there with what I wear all the time anyways. Although I guess Bethesda did just admit I'm some clown in a costume 24/7 already :P
---
private worlds are not DLC lol
---
Yea but there has to be a bunch of them there already. Some were also stacked, an explosion should send them flying.
---
It's definately gonna be behind a pay wall. They're cunts.
---
I love when a chuckle head comes along, with his trash grammar, awful punctuation, caps lock, and LMAOs and LOL's and calls me an idiot. 
---
I'm not arguing why Providence is pushing Zeni to further monetize. I'm saying that the poor results of 76 aren't the sole reason they're pushing BGS to monetize. Sure they want their investment recouped ... But BGS changing monetization tactics and mobile push started long before 76 launched.
---
I'm not buy 1st. Not because I'm opposed to it. I just don't have a need for what it offers.
---
Yup, after looking over his other comments on the same thread I used my powers of analytical deduction to determine he is just trolling for a rise and hits on his threads. 
---
So yes, bye Felicia is an appropriate response.
---
What is it then?
---
You don't even get enough atoms per month to not even buy a blue skin that's painted on armor.
---
Exactly. Who cares? Put up a pinned thread and clean up the sub. Tired of hearing about it. All bark and no bite.
---
You must be new to this whole internet thing then
---
Or they could not raise their overhead, keep charging subscriptions anyway, and make more money. You seem to underestimate how greedy they've been with this game.
---
&gt; they already have 2 mod stores so they already have infastructure to do it
---
Yes, but as we already discussed, their existing mod stores are built on the assumption that you'll download one set of mods, not a different set of mods for every server you connect to. This model would also make private servers impractical for players who don't have very fast internet, since it could easily take hours to download all the asset mods a given private server is using.
---
I can‚Äôt find that in the shop anywhere, are you sure it wasn‚Äôt taken out?
---
The thought of paying members not having to do what i do stops me from doing that.
---
I can only craft 300 bullets until my scrap runs out. 
---
1st class people wont have that problem.
---
I thought you were done being wrong about this. Carry on.
---
The main thing I did in Oblivion if I wanted to break the game was put on 4 pieces of clothing with 25% chameleon each. With full chameleon I could do anything (unlike with invisibility) and yet was untargetable.
---
For Morrowind, you indeed can make custom scrolls but they scale pretty harsh the more extreme you make them. For speedruns, the game can be beaten - albeit with exploits - in less than 5 minutes. So I doubt you care about spoilers but I'll include them anyway.
---
&gt;!To beat the game, you must kill Dagoth Ur, then go into a large room and destroy the Heart of Lorkhan. To destroy it, you must hit it with both the short sword Keening and the hammer Sunder a specific number of times. There are many ways to go about this. If you follow the main quest exactly, you will receive a bracer called Wraithguard from Vivec (the god) himself which allows you to wield either Keening or Sunder without injury. If you fuck up the main quest, there is a backdoor where you can kill Vivec, loot Wraithguard from his corpse (you cannot use it yet), and go visit the last dwarf, who will ask for a couple books in order to give you the jury-rigged version. This will permanently reduce your HP by a drastic amount, something like 200. The third way is to just ignore Wraithguard and use Keening and Sunder without protection. They will deal a LOT of damage every second, like enough to kill you in most circumstances. However, if you have the right spells/potions, and are fast, it shouldn't be a problem.!&lt;
---
In a Morrowind speedrun, the person gets out of Seyda Neen asap and there's a wizard right out of town who falls and dies and if you loot him you can get 3 scrolls of icarian flight, which fortify your acrobatics by like 1,000 or something. Even if you don't have feather, having high acrobatics at the moment of landing will brace your fall. So they will jump to Ald'Ruhn, I think they grab some stuff, I'm honestly not sure because they use exploits which I don't care for in this situation. Then they jump over the Ghostgate into the two lairs that hold the weapons needed to win, then off to the lair of the main boss. The exploit they use is grabbing one of the weapons needed to beat the game then very, very rapidly equipping and unequipping it in order to fortify their attributes in a way unintended by the game. 
---
I guess I'm boring because what I was obsessed with in Morrowind was being the fastest traveler ever, which is great especially when you do the Telvanni quest line or are dealing with Ashlander tribes. I had spells or items that had Mark, Recall, Divine Intervention, and Almsivi Intervention and I would try to be as efficient as possible because it's true that ground travel kind of sucks in Morrowind. I thought it was bad how GTA: Vice City (an amazing game) had 1 load screen separation, when Morrowind has hundreds. Going fast means you will spend more time loading than actually running.
---
Sorry for the rant, I just enjoy talking about Morrowind. There are a million mods for it which can eliminate some of the annoying parts if you are interested.
---
That's ok.
---
People all have diferent views and opinions on everything.
---
The reason I personally don't see the private servers as DLC is because they don't differ from the official servers that we have been using all this time.
---
If they allowed mods or the ability to change settings I would 100% agree it needs to be rented or paid for but as it is now I'm on the fence because I know they need some money to keep them running but forcing the subscription on people wanting a private world isn't right.
---
Blackbird I meant. Nah can't have been, it was only added about 3 weeks ago!
---
You said you could get the subscription for the price of 2 at mcdonalds. In America, to get that amount you have to get 2 of the largest combos at mcdonalds + a dollar more (which I guess could be ice cream) so my point is if you're spending $13 at mcdonalds for 2 people you eat a lot of McDonald's
---
So you didn‚Äôt read it... thought so...
---
You mean those who want everything for free? ü§î
---
"I've never even played a fallout game" then why are you here? just love being a toxic person eh?
---
Well, there is an in-game economy that is affected, and therefore your game is affected.  That's kind of an aside.
---
I think it's more that it creates a second tier of user, elite users that get improvements that should be in the base game.  Like I said, a private world isn't the problem, it's the implications of a elite tier that get everything long time users have been suggesting since day one.
---
You don‚Äôt love a child as is, you want him/her to be the best it can be, live up to its potential. That‚Äôs why you encourage their growth.
---
76 is a game brimming with potential, and no matter what side of the fence your on, anyone can see the game is not living up to that potential
---
Not sure that is the case here. We split up checked for that no other players.
---
The firehouse had dead bloated less than 20 seconds after the nuke landed.  Last time we played if you saw the nuke land you crashed the server so we waited inside the Bunker. Positioned the nuke not to hit the golf course we're the camp was. And headed right to the clubhouse.  We then did the route for close to an hour maybe 5 spawned it was very erratic. No meatpiles no more corpses. No ghouls stuck in odd spots.
---
&gt; They just want i
---
umm yes? quality of live improvements are the standard to be free updates. also most importantly bethesda voiced that there are going to be no monthly subcscribtions and all updates are going to be free so why shouldn't people be mad about the fact that bethesda lied again?
---
That suit tho, gotta spend some time in NW to get the glowing skellys to match. [I want.](https://media3.giphy.com/media/3oriO0qFHegUceU41i/source.gif)
---
I assumed it was a play on the political ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù doctrine.
---
A private session service!
---
hopefully
---
It's hard to say they're neglecting fixing the game. They're bug fix patches have scores of addressed issues.....
---
There's just so many, that for every one you fix, there's three more waiting.
---
it's paying for a private server like any other game charges you lol
---
No way refunds would be given by any company at this point. From the range of purchase prices being $30-$60+ folks have gotten that dollar amount of value by now. It‚Äôs like expecting to return an empty wrapper from a burger because it tasted bad.
---
More lore...than new vegas..or even four...is this satire? It REALLY doesnt. And I was an avid defender of this game saying that they'd tie it into lore eventually. This game has done more retcon of actual lore than provide it's own.. I know I'll be flamed for this but 4 had even more lore than new vegas. New vegas however having the best storyline to date.
---
Dude, read my TLDR hahahaha
---
Yes, there are a couple.
---
There is a camo skin that is always available, and there are several limited time options that may or may not be available anymore (Blackbird, and I believe they had a Free States skin too)
---
They're also doing pretty good with Battlefront 2. I'm hoping they realized that they can't rip us off and still make money, and if that is the case, hopefully Bethesda will realize it too.
---
Its the dupe glitch, they don't go into a paper bag. I watched a video of it being done and it seriously looks like a centipede made of mines coming out of the ground.
---
XB1, lvl92:  I played with a couple friends last night who paid for the subscription service on one of their private servers.  From my/their perspective the server was virgin.  I did not notice any evidence or previous play.
---
BUT
---
I told them about the scrap box reports which they had not heard mention of.  We played a couple of hours and one of them went back to their "box of holding" and everything was indeed gone - stable flux, steel, etc. all gone.  He checked both boxes on the private server - CAMP and TENT.  We then went to an adventure server and he checked his box only to find that two pieces of steel and two pieces of wood were inside.  He then placed his TENT, checked again and even that was gone.
---
The private server experience was good, and will be awesome once/if true NPCs become part of the game.  We experienced no lag.  The graphics were crisper and brighter, including the menus.
---
I won't rule out paying in some day, but for now I'll hang onto my hard earned mats and wait this sh!t storm out.
---
On PlayStation, the number of copies appears to be a little over 400k so across all platforms a million doesn‚Äôt seem to far off
---
Okay yeah I agree. This is definitely my one complaint of the private servers. I'd give me the ability to build towns and stuff. Every time I log and everything's the same.
---
And to even stop people from saying that all they would use it for us to farm Goods. They could even make the workshop still get taken over by the monsters even though you're not there so if you don't play for a couple days you're not constantly cranking up 556 at the Munitions Factory
---
Yea very odd
---
They originally were going to add the concept to Fallout 4 but it was too late to ship it. The bigwigs and Todd, then decided to give the base game to Bethesda Austin with the idea of putting it elsewhere when WV was chosen. Then Zenimax ordered it to be heavily weighed down with microtransactions so the game got cut up and what was sliced off became those things we have to buy. It is common now in the industry, sadly.
---
I think they should have called them private lobbies or sessions. These are nothing like the private severs of other games. Its like if gta v sold their invite only sessions. wtf?
---
Weird. I can get that for free in other games on my PC. Hosting servers isn't a new feature.
---
It‚Äôs a glitch where if you force quit or crash whilst loading into the world, everything in the scrap box gets wiped. I really hope Bethesda can replace it but I‚Äôm doubtful.
---
It literally is the exact same people... even the wording is spot on, multiple posts from the same group of people... they think it‚Äôs the new social justice way... 
---
Meanwhile I‚Äôll enjoy the game as I have now with my new scrap box and my own world with my friends! Oh yeah... with my collectron and fridge...lol
---
Uninstalled last night, and played Outer Worlds for a few hours this morning, feels more fallout than fallout 76, lol
---
If I remember well they failed with the lootbox on battlefront 2 and it was such a failed that they learnt and did better with bf5. Bf5 is a very nice game, they just failed the launch thanks to a douche at marketing
---
Thank you for understanding business economics.
---
I figured ya'll would just pretend you weren't lapping it up and defending it a month ago. You're bigger than most.
---
lol just sad
---
Somebody wrote that you have to server hop, but do it fairly quickly or you won't go back to a nuked zone (like within 90 seconds or something).
---
It was posted this morning or last night I think. They also said that if you do this after you kill them all, they'll respawn again. I don't have 1st so I haven't tried it myself.
---
Just looked it back up and the mod has been pulled. It was a mod that replaced the fire breathers outfit with the Ranger outfit offered in fallout 1st. It hit the mod page hours after the patch.
---
Nope... just like ESO it will grow...
---
Revolutionary sword kinda fits the bill no?
---
this would be fun.. but dosent matter how long i wait no one is coming to try kill me:( i hope they release "mods" soon so we can enable survival ruleset to our private worlds
---
I've had it. I subscribed to Xbox live on my PC. $1 for the first month, and $5 each month after that. And I started playing T.O.W. Infinitely better than 76. Later Bethesda.
---
&gt;EDIT: There‚Äôs been a bunch of comments about how this subreddit was never really a positive one. I think I‚Äôll walk back my original statement; compared to the General fallout subreddit, this one has been largely positive.
---
I don't think it's a question of whether the sub has been positive or negative.  The real issue is that, with most new additions to the game, there are those who would criticize is and those who would defend Bethesda.
---
This is the first time I can remember where Bethesda's actions have received  universal condemnation.   Virtually no one is speaking in their defense.  That is unique, which means that the title of your thread is absolutely correct.   Bethesda  should be very afraid for the future of this game.
---
I do agree it's shady to take community ideas and paywall them, and is not a business practice they should be following.
---
But, and this is the part I imagine is the biggest divide in this community, the regular player that logged in on Tuesday played the same game (except bug fixes, updates, etc.) that they played on Monday. They didn't lose anything, nothing was removed from their game, and it still *didn't cost them anything beyond the original purchase price*.
---
Fair enough :)
---
Well I think for private servers to work in a way that's satisfying, you'd need to bind character data to the server itself, the way it works in most similar games. If you have to be able to transfer your character between servers, it's going to severely restrict what you can do with mods.
---
So by your logic because company A offers something for free all company's are obligated to offer the same for free. Lol definitely a troll.
---
Revolutionary sword is close-ish
---
Ha they probably had full caps so didn‚Äôt bother picking up the last centipede
---
They also do it with meat clevers, it looked like a meat clever waterfall. They were coming out of a tree. Lol
---
I had exactly the same,also private server.iv been contacted by bgs and they are investigating it.
---
Yes, even if your alone it gives you the same PvP warning.
---
Thank you we will give that a shot tonight
---
Before I go into my rant, diatribe, monologue whatever you want to call it, I do love the Fallout series. It's Bethesda I have the issue with. It seems they have lost their way. Also, that my faith that things are getting fixed is waning. I still have an open ticket for Retrieve DiMA's Memories in the Fallout 4: Far Harbour expansion pack. I have a recent one for "Order of the Tadpole Quest, Photograph" which I have a feeling will receive the same attention.
---
Like a few of us here, I did a preOrder of Fallout 76. I purchased the Tricentennial Edition to show my support for the game. I was warned by many people in the online/gaming community that this game was going to be a disaster. In retrospect, I should have listened. 
---
The initial price of this was 90 USD. I was ok with that, another Fallout game to play, modernized (16 times the resolution) and larger (four times the size of Fallout 4)  as were told an that Epic event which has been quoted to death. 
---
Access to the BETA. Cool, I can have a small say in what needs fixing. Little did I know, this was an early release. A limited time early release. In which they had no inclination of fixing. It also resembled an Add-On for Fallout 4 than a brand new game. It's the same engine! But this is all ancient history right now. Right?
---
After official release I played it for a month, left in disgust hoping that eventually with updates, patches and downright community uproar the game will be playable again someday.
---
Fast forward to September of this year. I decided to give the game a shot again. See what has changed. I saw 2 new modes, not my cup of tea, but I am sure others are enjoying it.
---
First few sessions, just a 1 or 2 hours after playing my go game. Cool, no "Disconnected from Server". AWESOME! BOOM! It happened. Ok, not as bad as it was before, but still a nuisance. I can live with this. Soon my level 11 (this is where I stopped in December 2018) became level 20. From just 1 or 2 hours, it was now something I was enjoying again.
---
Yeah, some issues are still there, graphical glitches, a few things there and here, but not as game breaking as it used to be. I invited a group of 3 other friends in. They themselves started to enjoy the game. We all agree that game is flawed and is no way complete or close to the original description.
---
I started doing the quests, found that Order of the Tadpole is broken for me. I can not for the life of me, get photos to register. As I mentioned earlier, stuck in Tech Support limbo. I  am taking their silence on the matter as hopes I give up on the matter, no way, I am going to pull an Andy Dufrense. 
---
Another friend, has found that his Firebreathers Quest is broken. I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this...
---
Now, you release this. A complete slap in the face to many of us that have stuck it out or gave it another chance. Are you purposely planning to sabotage this game or just don't care? If end profit is all your concerned with, I believe you will be sorely disappointed.
---
There will be those that cash in on this service, there are those that cash in on Atomic Shop, but I bet it's not what you hoped for. Eventually those numbers will fall as well, along with each stupid move, the player base.
---
I'm going to stick it out, in the regular public server to see where things lead. I have no hopes that my issue with this quest (or any future quest I may endeavour and find broken) will get fixed. Funny enough, Tech Support said this patch would fix it. Guess what the first thing I tried Tech Support?
---
I will not pay anymore real life money for this game. $90 USD is a good commitment which I will not repeat. 
---
Nor do I care if Bethesda read this or not, I'm simply getting this off my chest. A smarter move was to make this a freebie for all. Considering the colossal disaster this game has been from the get go. 
---
You've lost a golden opportunity to bring players back, get new ones, yet instead chose to drive more away
---
For anyone trying - the Cat house is a great place to start
---
Definition of dlc below.... Private servers in no way extend the game. 
---
No game in history has called private servers DLC, you're grasping for straws my friend. 
---
DLC¬†refers to additional content that can be downloaded within a video game. It has become a common feature in PC, console, and mobile games. The most common type of¬†downloadable content¬†is extra maps or levels that extend the gameplay of the original game
---
No. I'm just saying it seems a bit silly to me. Anyway, they're adding something to the game. That sounds like the general concept of DLC to me, but what do I know?
---
Probably, that would be my guess as to why they left them. Or maybe they got scared they would get in trouble.
---
Yep, uninstalled both the game and the launcher. I've been a Bethesda fanboy for over 15 years, and I've defended them tooth and nail over the last couple years.  I'm done.  They'd better hope Starfield and TES6 are PERFECT games, because it's going to take a long time for them to recover from this if that's not the case.
---
Everyone's complaining about pumpkins and I'm just here excited to finally get the Fireman Outfit lmao
---
Those costumes are pretty nice.
---
And also ignore the negatives.
---
omg is that new? ;)
---
I was able live without 1st and I'm still. They didn't take anything from me. 
---
This is FALLOUT, nobody said it's easy.
---
"They're giving the community what they asked for"
---
Yeah but the community didn't ask for the features to be locked behind a 100$ paywall
---
In fact Pete Hines stated that all of this stuff was supposed to be for FREE
---
Low levels often carry a lot of junk tho. There is no reason to discriminate. If you are standing up, on my way, whether you are level 4 or 563. Doesn't matter. 
---
I do like toying with the low levels first tho and will often offer to teach them how to make a PvP build starting out so they can defend themselves better if they aren't too salty.
---
No, you are pretty sure of yourself that I'm a paid Bethesda shill.
---
Seriously, I want to make some of those big Bethesda bucks shilling the game on Reddit.  If I'm going to post on Reddit, may as well get paid for it!
---
For like the third time, the issue people have is with the mini camp, unlimited scrap storage and all the other noncosmetics that will go to the elite tier.  No one really cares about private servers costing money.
---
Oof... i dont know how im supposed to tell you what i mean without confusing you.. 
---
2nd class - goes out every 300 bullets to farm for more scrap to get ammo, ok?
---
1st class grinds them once and never needs to farm again, saving that trouble of looking for more scrap while youre in the mood to just shoot stuff, yknow???
---
Wow after all those patches!
---
I couldn't nuke it because every time I tried, it crashed Bethesda's servers.
---
I get why they did it, But feel like they didn't have to.  They could still make an offline version on the cheap.
---
they promised all free updates no DLC, season pass etc. [go at 2:40 you can see for yourself shill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9WN1mTOegA)
---
Look y'all, we're all good god (formerly known as Todd) worshiping gamers here. It's not as bad as it seems, and y'all ignorant lol
---
I see. I'm not a hardcore gamer but I can see why those feel annoyed that they suddenly are "forced" to pay to enjoy all benefits from the game
---
Upvote.  I discovered Reddit because of this game and I found that positivity and cooperation always carried the day.  The negative BS was easy to avoid.  This is way more explosive than the repair kit blowback.
---
Edit: XB1, lvl 92: Played since day 1 of the BETA and will continue to play because I enjoy the community.
---
ROFL you think the view of this game is neutral? Are you really that delusional??
---
I think most the children are gone now so the adults can speak without all the crying lol
---
they still do vigorously defend FO76, no matter what lmao
---
Just before I played 76, I had gotten done playing through all of the Fallout games in order, some of them for the first time. I even sloughed my way through Tactics. I knew 76 wouldn't be great, but I probably would've actually bought it for 60$ if it was on Steam just to finish the saga.
---
I saw the news. I saw how badly Bethesda messed up. I waited until the free trial week and played it then. It was just kinda generic. Bethesda clearly made some bad choices while making this game, but I would give them a second chance. Bethesda would be able to limp battered, beaten, bloodied, and bruised to ES6. Then this happened. Bethesda has lost my goodwill and my business.
---
Fallout 76 at launch was a mistake. Buggy visuals, no NPC's, bad combat... that was poor judgment. This was intentional. This was calculated. They purposefully decided to sell convenience instead of improving the game. This was on purpose. Goodbye, Bethesda.
---
people need a reason to buy a subscribtion getting mod support is a reason,most people change there lo reguarly if they dont have fast internet it happens with skyrim/fallout mods they just have to wait untill it downloads they could do it in sections give people 5 or so mod lists that are stored when they want to join a server they just load that list
---
100% Upvote mainly for being civil and presenting a well thought out critique of new options and growth! That‚Äôs the way a community grows! 
---
Totally appreciate that! Thank you!
---
Can you mod my Ultracite Gatling laser
---
that's how i feel haha
---
everything is just killing time until Cyberpunk
---
I'd say adding a new feature to a game counts as DLC. So addng a solo mode would count, but that's just me.
---
So your argument is that because the content doesn't "extend the game" in any way, it's okay to charge for it? That sounds backward to me. Feels like you're getting LESS and charing MORE.
---
I don't understand the sarcasm in the comments. This subreddit has been the most positive one bethesda could hope for, and quite frankly, other companies would kill for. After every misstep, every screw up, every issue bethesda pulled, I found almost nothing but positivity in this sub. Meanwhile, similar subreddits like anthem's were burning the entire time, yet all the while anyone who said something bad about 76 were shouted down for being too negative. Posters defended the atom shop adding repair kits and fridges as "not pay 2 win" despite Pete Hines cosmetic only statement. 
---
TL/DR compared to most subreddits, you guys took it far longer and far harder up the butt than you should have.
---
You will, lol.
---
The worst is that people keep bringing outer world like if this bad rip off gonna be better.
---
I understand your point, I really do. However, this is a forward evolving experience game. And what they are doing also flies in the face of what they said earlier. Pete Hines promised all purchases would all be cosmetic. Now they broke that, and thereby have changed the course of evolution for this game. And this eventually, and currently, is changing that experience.
---
Yes, that player has the same game. But, when he's struggling with his inventory weight management, and then sees someone who isn't...that's going to affect how he feels about the game.
---
It‚Äôs funny because I just finally started getting into the game properly the past couple of weeks and really enjoyed my time with it and thought damn, Bethesda have started to turn this game around, then all of a sudden they just went full circle...
---
See for me, I only play to have fun. Getting killed in the first 5 minutes is fun. Hiding in a bush for 15 minutes isn't.
---
My first NW map I came in 2nd, that'll never happen again.
---
I know, right? I guess people just really like that game.
---
lol @ whoever stood under that tree üòÇüòÇ
---
Well that seems pretty trivial. Most don't even horde scrap junk. I personally don't need it. What other non cosmetics are you talking about? What the repair kits? I have hundreds and never paid for a single one. So
---
So we'd be paying more money solely to be bug testers...that seems a little backwards.
---
Blah blah blah the whole game is still in beta blah blah.
---
There's not enough reason to pay for the subscription at the current price point to not get exclusive content. Yes, there's still the private worlds. Still the atoms. But it's the whole package that draws most people in. I wouldn't pay for the sub if it was only early access content.
---
One pixel on OLED monitor that slightly emits bright thoughts.
---
Have never played this game but I've been a huge Fallout guy since NV.  When this came out, I was deep into RDR2, so I saved my money and then witnessed all the negativity surrounding the released product.
---
Hoping people here could tell me what the games like now and if it's worth buying? I hear it's improved a bit?  If people would be so kind, I'd appreciate some honest reviews...
---
They spent minimum effort on this game, if this was something You made, would You be "afraid" for its future?
---
Me too! Lol
---
People don't necessarily have 12 bucks a month to dedicate to one videogame.
---
Stop being an ass
---
They said they're going to add mods and settings to the private worlds, but you're right that that's not in the game yet. 
---
They said the cosmetics were put in the game to keep things running, so they could make sure everything else is free.
---
I'd say the servers differ in that they allow you to play solo or to curate who you want in said worlds.
---
&gt; they dont have fast internet it happens with skyrim/fallout mods
---
In Skyrim and Fallout, you only have to download those mods once per playthrough, not once for every different server you join. And in practice, you're going to end up with terabytes of mod data on your hard drive after a while. It's not going to happen, dude. Everything about the way they set up their server structure and the way they've been monetizing this games points to a small, carefully curated list of mods that you'll be able to choose from when you open a private server -- assuming mods ever happen at all.
---
Like the marketing material said to the community, "You deserve it."
---
i agree, but well need to wait to see how ‚Äúgive-us-money-for-the-same-thing-youve-done-for-9months-strategy‚Äù pays off
---
I obviously dont lol. I'm here talking to your grumpy ass
---
I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt have the subscription and have never had to go out farming materials every 300 bullets.
---
Oh I got a good laugh out of this one, bud lmao
---
It doesn't matter how "good" they make it, *they're liars &amp; cheats*. Development doesn't fix dishonesty.
---
Dance emotes are the best
---
I got a railway gun need fully modded think 4 or 5 mods done, a fixer 3 mods, and 2 mods for Sheepsquatch
---
All EA and Obsidian bots ;p
---
My Collectron finally learned German with the new update,  I love it!
---
It‚Äôs just a premium membership. Doesn‚Äôt mean you matter less. Just subscriptions keep the lights on. If Fallout First makes enough money, the F2P players such as yourself will continue to have a game to play for a long time.
---
BRO IM DOWN!!!
---
It is junk. Take over every worskshop and add all resource extractors on your server. Appear offline if you want to be alone. You will have it all back plus more within an hour. I haven't lost anything yet. Did you interact with a friend's scrapbox? I ask cause someone else lost the stuff in theirs after interacting with a friends scrapbox.
---
I see, maybe they heard my footsteps and fast travelled before they could pick them all up.
---
Trolls downvote for anything, appreciate the service
---
You're right but you know what I'm really thinking? Curved. Swords
---
I fucking love the moth man one. It's so dope
---
Did you see that legendary enemies now spawn when taking workshops and 3* actually drop 3* items?
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty awesome! I have a ton of stable flux! 
---
Smoothest server experience ever and well worth it 100%! 
---
Glad you‚Äôre enjoying it as much as me and my friends are!
---
also heard if someone else joins it can force a respawn - will be trying later to confirm!
---
You are wrong. I preorderd ESO, played in all the betas, and quit shortly after launch, before my free month ran out. Why? because the main quest was bugged so you could not progress, the side quests were bugged so you could not progress, every delve was camped by 50 people who killed the boss the second it spawned, and pvp was ruled by invincible vampire bat spam - but only if you could actually get through the eternal loadscreen into cyrodiil. Also, if you tried to join pvp server while in a group then your client would crash to desktop.
---
ESO was a total disaster - and that is just the bugs. I am not counting the horrid game design and endgame progression systems they had to totally revamp with the "One Tamriel" relaunch.
---
I went back every expansion - to see if it had gotten better... eventually it did, but not until they totally redesigned almost everything a few years later. And now, it is one of the best MMOs. And, ESO is heavily instanced with a limited player count per instance, so it is the same as FO76, the only difference is the player count per server.
---
Yeah no. This sub is nothing but complaints. I don't understand how people expect something like private rental servers would be free? They found a way to make it mostly worth it by giving you a ton of free atoms with the sub and other things.  Eventually we'll be able to mid the servers. Everyone is so entitled and no one can give me a good, legitamite reason why they should be free.
---
Pete Hines said everything will be free. No season pass fees no dlc fees that was a lie. That's my problem.
---
Yeaaah it fits but I'm wanting sabers that are so sabery you spell them sabre
---
Well doesn‚Äôt the issue really come from the quality of servers then? I mean it‚Äôs pretty easy to understand why the private servers load everything better, there‚Äôs not 25 other people with 50,000 items the game has to load and account for. I do get that. And I havent gone to a private server yet BUT, they need to do something about server stability in public servers in a major way! Sbq (the main thing I still like to do) is getting ridiculously slow! All the sound effects all choppy and crunchy, the frame rate dropping to 1 fps and she just stutters across the damn screen, or even getting frozen screens and getting dash boarded! I keep seeing the patch notes that say fixed issue for server stability but I honestly haven‚Äôt noticed anything. I paid for a month so I could get all the rewards but I wasn‚Äôt really even going to use the private server option, until now lol.
---
Exactly, the whole buggy mess thing confuses me. I have relatively few issues and in the case that something does occur it's a minor inconvenience, my friends and I laugh it off, and we continue
---
My true rage at bethesda lies in their refusal to police nuclear winter and get certain asshats out of their so people can actually play fair and square
---
As much as I can fit in the stash yeah. If that amount is unlimited, I'd have a huge supply of scrap to convert to ammo/upgrades or caps as needed vs. having just enough for some ammo and upgrades and then needing to farm more.
---
I am convinced these people are either paid off from Bethesda or just complete fucking morons
---
Minecraft charges for private servers... Go look at nodecraft lol it's $20/month for a private Minecraft server
---
No offense here, but I am going to be offensive if you have a thin skin.
---
Most of what you suggest here sounds like you are looking for ways to make premium services available to everyone.  This is a very slippery slope. 
---
Subscribers pay for exclusive services.  Most of what you suggested here is, "ok, you can have your premium stuff, but then we all get access to it a few weeks later" is just a slap in the face to those people that do pay. 
---
You do not continue to make profits when you ostrisize your paying player base.   Shareholders dont cave to the demands of people that do not pay.  They make decisions based on who pays them. 
---
You do not nickel and dime away premium services to non paying members, that defeats the point of premium services. 
---
If you want access to premium stuff, pay the premium price.  Simple as that.  It costs less per month than most peoples daily intake of fast food.
---
They may not all be players now, but I guarantee many were at one point, meaning they purchased they game, hence their opinions matter just as much as yours if not more.
---
Who are you IGN? I don‚Äôt recall you telling me anything üòÇ
---
I would if I didn't have to level up to respec.
---
I decide to do this the day before the fallout 1st was revealed because my psplus ran out
---
That's an option. Mojang doesn't force you to pay for servers. You can host them yourself.
---
if he isn't worried about his credibility then he has nothing to worry about. no doubt there will still be legions of idiots happy to buy overpriced trash like 76 and all its microtransactions. i'm sure he makes more than enough to not care about integrity.
---
ALWAYS looking for crafted goods tbh. I don't make it myself but the things I sell are usually stuff I got from other crafters. I never find the time
---
You're not hosting the server. Bethesda is. You just have access to it.
---
I love the Fallout series. So glad I saw through this release. It was obvious from the beginning where they were going with this.
---
People complain about spending money in game... same people pay for domains to trash the game... haha! 
---
Capitalism and big business win yet again, thank you for playing...lol
---
It WAS getting better is the thing. I picked the game up in May during the first surge of new content and well after most of the bugs had been squashed.
---
The problem is they stopped. Theres not enough content and the world just feels empty and boring.
---
Outer Worlds...
---
There are many still around.  Dont think we are safe just yet.
---
I paid for the game they sold me, which included, in their words, this content that's been locked behind *additional* charges they explicitly stated wouldn't happen. This wasn't in the road map, this wasn't announced at launch, this pushed back additional content they promoted... Sorry, can't twist anything to make this ok.
---
?
---
Hmmm. If I say I'm getting more then it's content and therefore dlc. If I say it's less then why am I paying... damn!
---
üíÄ
---
Which is kind of getting at the issue. I don't think you're even allowed to host your own server for Fallout 76, are you?
---
Here for the karma?
---
This thread? All of it? This highlight the problem perfectly: Despite all the lies, all the bugs, despite all the milking of players this thread is full of people saying "I'm sTiLl HaViNg fUn" and you are the issue: until every voice online says "This is not okay" it will continue. Wise up, stop speaking positively about this mess.
---
Yeah if only the lower classed citizens got a stable experience too!
---
Not having to scrutinize storage is nice. When I go hoarding junk through out the game, I go in adventure mode and invite all my friends over to my world. I empty my Scrap box into a bag and invite them all to go through it and pick out what they want. I also leave all my other stuff unlocked so they can help themselves. Sharing is caring
---
It's not mere quality of life or convenience. Most ranged (non-energy) builds run bandoleer level 2 to carry many thousands of rounds of .45 and/or 5.56. Having unlimited junk means you can drop those two cards, carry much less ammo, and merely craft 1,000 rounds as needed. There are plenty of tinker benches and you just freed up two perk slots. Freeing up perk cards is selling power. 
---
As for it being a minor thing, that's not what the subscribers have said. Many have raved about how much they love their expanded stash and how important it was to them. 
---
I wouldn't have a problem with a fee for private servers, if they have the same lag as public servers and merely gate who can use them, nor do I have a problem with discounted atoms. 
---
It's Orwellian when a seasons pass isn't a season's pass. I appreciate you trying to discuss, but if we cannot agree on basic terms, it's hard to have a dialog.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs solely early access, it‚Äôs more how it was delivered and perceived is as some pay to win feature. Instead if everyone got the features after say 3 months then new features were brought to first, it would be a benefit and a way of encouraging signups.
---
On the bug testers, as is this happens for any content rolled out. And in the main, new features/content are optional anyway. Would be the same for 1st if it was Early Access.
---
That's funny, I am convinced the neg posters that don't even play the game are just part of an Astroturf campaign
---
Nope, just mine, only one person i was playing with last night and we both knew not to cross that line lol. I dont do workshops l, i can collect faster then those things produce being a junk dealer on ps4 lol...it was literally only 2 hours worth of shit, but 1000s of things gone, even more in caps.
---
It did.  
---
Have you played in the last 2 days.
---
How about munitions factory undisturbed all day. Set up workshop, defences and portable camp play in world fast travel back for free collect rinse repeat.
---
Neither m8. Just folks loving the game
---
Your account is literally mcsaltmaker, if your just gonna troll try and find some compassion in your life, you may like it.
---
I'll bite. My views haven't changed.
---
*Why* are you lurking month old posts?
---
I mean you're getting less than you're getting in the free DLC.
---
Also, you may not be able to find people calling private servers DLC but I'm sure people call "features" or "modes" dlc.
---
Same here, it‚Äôs crazy
---
Well you can buy any other ‚Äúgood‚Äù skin you wanted. I guess it‚Äôs not enough to buy the worst skin available(imo) but I got the outfit I wanted so in the end it worked out pretty good for me. As far as I‚Äôm concerned I got a good deal for 12 bucks if I was going to spend 10 in the first place. This would of been the second time I spent 10 bucks on atoms since I started playing almost a year ago so I‚Äôm ok with it.
---
This sub?? Maybe /r/FO76FilthyCasuals is what you meant to reference as a beacon of positivity, but this sub was a cesspool of negativity during every patch cycle, content release, or bug spot. Yikes.
---
No need to insult the players
---
Its a wonderful game. I have been playing it since the beta. It was always good and has gotten better.
---
Some guy you randomly met on a terrorist breeding ground (4chan) is not your friend.
---
But your experience playing must have been fun at the very least.
---
I feel bad for the devs because yeah the games buggy and all that, but I feel like Zenimax made deadlines for certain things and if they push some things, they are going to have to release other stuff. I still love this game and I'm still playing, kinda. I'm stuck in outer world's now because it's almost like a clone of fallout but better in some ways.
---
Tbh it was one dollar. You get more out of it than the game it self lmao.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with facts‚Äù
---
My point is that all the content would be made available in time. Let‚Äôs say 3 months after coming first to 1st members. 
---
Right now it‚Äôs not communicated as such or branded as such. I flagged my post as Suggestion to reflect this.
---
I‚Äôm down Psn is same, I‚Äôll set my travel tent üèï
---
Its fun.
---
I play games because they are fun.
---
It is by design a circlejerk sub.
---
I'm not grumpy lmao, already said I'm not touching this game again because I clearly don't matter to BGS as long as I don't pay for their microtransactions.
---
PC public server is very LAGGY! My  CAMP spends 3 mins to load! Never happens before until update 14!
---
Hardly anyone ‚Äúcame into‚Äù the sub, Bethesda has just screwed up enough to get the silent majority pissed.
---
Fuck. Dont tell the FBI!
---
I guess I‚Äôve always just found a way to use up all my scrap. I do wel excess rubber and stuff I don‚Äôt need but things like steel, lead, plastic, I‚Äôve never been in a situation where I don‚Äôt have room for what I need and am limited by stash space etc.
---
Agreed.  Check my last post in my post history.   I love the game, and really want it to be better than the path it's going down.  We know Beth watches this sub, so complaining is about the only way I can hopefully influence those decisions.  That and logging off, which is what I'm also doing.  I'm invested in the game, what's one to do?
---
&gt; More like a protest that blocks of streets 
---
How so ? You can literally don't look at the topics you don't want to and nobody will be blocked to post any other kind of topic, this is extremly unmatchable.
---
&gt; You're only posting in this sub because of Fallout 1st
---
Yes...because it did happen...what is wrong with it ? You are complaing that I am complaing ? At least my complaining is about something bad that happen, your complaining is...not sure, I mean you might like this greedy move, I don't know how you get the money but the vastly majority of people don't like a bit.
---
If you have any better solution feel free to share, but never heard of any kind of change by doing nothing, and if you agree with the greedy move just buy the subscription and be happy...
---
EDIT: bad formating
---
Ironically FF14, the best MMO right now, is cheaper than both of these subs.
---
Makes you think.
---
I waited a few days hoping the game would become more stable, and when it didn't I tried to get a refund. Literally the first time in my life a customer service rep told me to go f**k myself.
---
Not anymore, was then...now im irritated and will not be renewing the 1st membership lol
---
OP jerks off to 3D goblin midgets hahahahahahahahaha
---
It's that I'm not familiar with pvp in fallout. The VATS system makes it a bit dumb anyway in my honest opinion. But now I think I'll look further into it. Just to counter an attacker.
---
I'm sorry, but where I come from, "keep crying kid," is generally considered condescending, dismissive, and insulting. 
---
And yet again, you've missed the point. The situation is, *yet once again* Bethesda has lied to the community. There situation is that they are and have been putting features that the community has been requesting (and indeed, expecting) behind paywalls.
---
I don't have an issue with the concept of paying for a server. I also don't have issue with spending money on microtransactions, by and large. What I have issue with is, and what this (now deleted) post (and by extension, the members of the community that share similar views) have issues with, Bethesda made certain promises about this game, cosmic only microtransactions, future features and DLC being free, that this WASN'T just a shameless cash grab, that it's a legit and serious entry into the franchise (if not a tentpole title), etc., and they've not only walked back in those, they've done so and basically told the community to suck it. 
---
OP could have went about it in a less confrontational manner. But just because he failed Intro to Communication 101 doesn't negate legit criticism.
---
I fucking love Fallout. I fucking love Bethesda. I've been with Bethesda since Daggerfall, and with Fallout since the very first game. But just because I love something doesn't mean it's above reproach, that I can't call out deceptive and/or predatory business practices, and that just because I like it, other people can't criticize it and if they do I get to be a jerk to them about it because they have a different option than I do.
---
There. I've explained it as much as I feel like from a cellphone. I can explain it to you, but I can't understand it for you.
---
TL;DR OP deleting post does not negate my point, nor honest criticism of there game, and just because someone is criticising something doesn't give cart blanche to be a dillweed, nor does it mean they dislike what they are criticising, in pointed fact, they may love it deeply and are criticising it not to troll or be whining, but because they want to see the game and the community *flourish.*
---
And now you've reached the core of the issue.
---
I never had the wish to visit the USA. But I think WV makes me change my mind xD Thanks for sharing!
---
I had hope it really would be better but, after all the updates its still really boring and this fallout 1st garbage has really turned me off. 
---
Now I'm terrified for the elder scrolls and starfield.
---
Betheada has caught the EA virus
---
At least we now know where all the damn pumpkins we've given Jack went to. I alone must have given him 3000 in the last year, being generous on the days missed.
---
It is, but it's a circlejerk sub by design. Imagine having to moderate it lol
---
Thank you! I like it enough to pay for a pip boy...I‚Äôm going to pay for a few new features.
---
We already payed for the game, a stable server experience for all makes sense.
---
Explain to me why you think its good please. I'm not trying to be the gaming police I'm just a disgruntled Fallout 1n2 player trying to understand your thoughts.
---
Pro Tip:  You posted on the internet, the FBI already knows.
---
I don‚Äôt know it was a alright grind for the first 70 levels. I wanted to get a grasp of the lore and I wanted to make my own opinion on the game. I can‚Äôt remember a point when I was in love with the game I‚Äôll play going through the game loops but I always remain skeptical and critical of it. When people asked me if they should get it I never knew how to answer and usually suggested waiting till NPCs are added. 76 right now at its core is a looter shooter with a larger emphasis player interactions. I usually recommend games like destiny and borderlands 2 or 3 or even the previous fallout games.As for why I kept playing I never really bought the game I got it for Christmas my mom knew I loved the fallout franchise so she got my the steelbook edition so I didn‚Äôt have a reason not to try the game out.
---
Thanks for getting this together!
---
I‚Äôm picturing a 300 moment when he says ‚ÄòThis is Sparta‚Äô!
---
If you put it that way it does sound bad.
---
This is what makes zero sense. You say you don‚Äôt want the scrap box... well don‚Äôt buy it then lol. It‚Äôs pretty simple.
---
Dude its epic. I had the acid workshop to myself and all the lead workshops and no troubles what so ever
---
Thanks! I made a trip last week and will be posting a lot more pics soon of IRL places of FO76!
---
I got mirror balls and strobe lights on lock
---
I mean, you're just crying. If you don't care, why announce it? You just want attention.
---
Their never catch me alive!
---
One should not worry about imaginary points that do not affect you out in the world.
---
same , 8 plus hours and no lag or weird crashes . I've jumped back and fourth a few times to help a friend or do a queen fight and havent had any issue with scrap .
---
ESO plus is popping now though, and you get free expansions. Fallout 1st, all expansions are already free unless they are going back on their word, again. But I'm only pointing fingers at Zenimax because this is what the higher ups do. The video explains it alot better than I can, but I feel like either Bethesda promised Zenimax certain things and some had to go thru, it Zenimax told them to come up with ideas to make them more money to look great to more investors. But like, Juicehead talks about how Zenimax was given a couple million or something like that a few years back from this investment firm, and that since then it's been going down hill. But like, each person at the corporate company doesn't need a million each. I just don't understand. I want to know the real details but we will never know
---
Could you give me a link to the original source of this? Thanks!!
---
Edit: Nevermind. Found it!

---
Well I'm sure you learned your lesson
---
If I still worked for them, I would have explained that the better way to have created this would have been to have solo play with Co-op through friends list on Steam/Bethesda.net. These types of games are a bit easier to create and maintain rather than a server were you need to keep money flowing. The creation club and other things that you build atoms for would not cause any additional issues in the community since you are only playing with friends not strangers. I play 7 days to die with my own server as well as other games and it is easy enough to set them up. Small companies could create games easily like this so it shouldn't be a problem for a big company like Bethesda.
---
That pirate costume looks surprisingly good, definitely will be trying to get it myself and if not I can always buy it from someone.
---
Lol... Well you're wrong. That's all I'm not going to keep going with this.
---
I understand, but it's unreasonable given their own announcements. I bought the game under a particular set of conditions outlined explicitly by Bethesda, and that's been systemically dismantled from the beginning.
---
/u/ratchetsup, you posted Oct 31st in your update in OP. Unless you're time travelling, in which case please let us all know how all this mess goes, I'm guessing you probably actually meant the 24th ;)
---
I will consider coming back if, and only if, Wastelanders launches and doesn't revert the game back to the broken state in which it was at launch, and if it's free.  
---
Everyone should feel betrayed at this point.
---
More good work. Thank you!
---
The 1st features are pretty bad ass.  The dances are awesome, and the tent makes fast travel trivial to favorite areas that may have been too hostile to drop a real camp in (like D-9, where I put mine at)
---
You‚Äôre only renting sessions, not worlds so any building you do on workshops will not save :(
---
I don't agree with the conclusions drawn because I haven't been given a reasonable argument for them. Please do not refer to me as a liar.
---
Then why are you so supportive or overmonetization. Happy to hear you‚Äôre not part of the problem at least. But no the monetization was nowhere near this level. FO4 had some questionable dlc situations, blades and shelter online exist yes. But 76 went from cosmetics only, to paid mobile time savers, to a subscription all in under 1 year, and time savers to subscription in like 1 month. You don‚Äôt see a change in pace for monetization going on here? Providence is ready to be done with this deal and want their money fast. Fallout 1st money isn‚Äôt going to Bethesda for dlc (maybe 0.001% of it is, which is why no substantial content updates besides NW which only appeals to half the players and wasn‚Äôt adding any new models or anything just tweaking settings really). Fallout 1st money going straight to providence equity, Zenimax wants the players to subsidize their losses resulting from dumb decisions during development. Time to wake up!
---
Na dude. This isn't players in anyway. Some are bots most are people who sub to some youtube cuck.
---
[OP wised up](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dml5dh/i_want_to_publicly_apologize_for_defending_the/f547b8w?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x).
---
They don't have to allow you to. You're getting off point, it's still not a dlc
---
So then this subscription does indeed have value. You're getting content. A feature: hosted servers.
---
Tell me about it.  Got any others? They fixed the despawning bug on ash and goo piles is one off the top of my head.
---
Fallout 1st is optional!
---
If you don‚Äôt believe me go check!
---
Your game didn't change, they just offer new things.
---
I have no server issues atm, and I don't have 1st.
---
yea the game is fun and all but it's only about 40 hours ...what then
---
If I wanted to do this I would have already done it I was just curious.
---
Yo, imagine if you had not let the rage brainwash your opinions. You would be still playing a game you love, having a great time hunting legendary schorchbeasts.
---
Instead you let the groupthink convince you the game was somehow different then it was last week.
---
Why would you pay any attention to the halfwits who post here?
---
No that's not what I said, there is no added content. Why are you trying to twist my words around?
---
I like to sweat my self while fapping to random fallout porn like a real pro
---
No it doesn't. Say you are a father of a family and you abandoned your children and wife. You return home about a decade later and have a say about your daughter's performance in college. You think they are gonna give a fuk about you? They gonna call the cops bro
---
They won‚Äôt care. Enough morons will continue putting money into the game.
---
"Those private server's are not private and the Scrap Box is our take on the Ultra Beast Guzlord."
---
Then I am mistaken. That was my impression, however. Take it or leave it; it is inconseqeuntial to my suggestions.
---
How is the player going to see someone who isn't struggling with inventory management? There isn't a big flashing sign that says "I don't have to worry about how much junk I pick up!" 
---
If I'm hitting a point where I'm holding on to too much stuff, I build something, sell something, use it, whatever.  It hasn't been game-breaking for me. And I never really find myself in a position where I'm comparing my experience with someone else's. My friend bought the refrigerator. I didn't think about how it was impacting his QOL in game compared to mine - I eat some of my food, sell some of it, use the cannibal perk, whatever. Maybe it will be very different with something like the camp and the stash box, but I genuinely don't think I'll know whether or not a person has access to these items or not. I know this could open the door to bigger QOL changes being put behind a paywall, but right now, I don't see either of these items drastically changing the way I interact with the game.
---
Yeah, I should have just used italics. That was my jank work around the lack of an underlined text tag.
---
Can you shill any harder?
---
My only complaint is the addition of the scrapbox as a paid item. Other than that, I think private servers were a nice addition.
---
Just look at Joker. Highly controversial, poorly reviewed, now looking at becoming the highest grossing R-rated movie.
---
People want to be part of the discussion. Everyone wants to form their own opinion and be part of the controversy.
---
falloutfirst.com did it better tbh
---
Value and content are two separate things
---
Apologies, we will work on adding the punch at a later date.
---
I'm going to have to boot up FO1 again, cause my memory tells me you are fucking nuts.
---
I‚Äôm loving fallout 1st. Actually a pretty solid deal IMO
---
I think that's more of a testament to the fact that 1/3rd of the people playing the game are whales that will buy anything Bethesda releases for the game. I decided to try playing again a few weeks ago since Wastelanders was supposed to come out soon at the time, and almost every character I saw was level 80+, and many of those are level 200+... All that's left in the game at this point are the diehards.
---
They need to fire whoever said yes to this
---
This isn‚Äôt DLC chump.
---
Locally-hosted private servers are absolutely free.
---
It‚Äôs the first online game I‚Äôve dove neck deep into and I fell in love with it.
---
Fleshlight of positivity, may the circle jerk never end.
---
Hope and masochism.
---
Even just using it normally provides an okay flow of cash for a minor in the form of amazon gift cards.
---
Mmmmm...white chocolate macadamia nut please
---
People are so scared of PvP someone downvoted you for saying you wish someone would try to fight you. That's really a special kind of cowardice.
---
Yeah. Private servers are not content. So he hasn't lied.
---
You've just pretty much stated that the game is pay to win. You can sell real cash purchase s for gold and gold rules in ESO. From upgrade materials to item sets, OP potions, crafting mats etc. That's not good mate.
---
If you didnt notice they were pushing outer limits in the media based off from fallouts mess ups. Looked on purpose to me. Bethesda wants us all to go buy outer worlds, its easy to see
---
The meaning of content is completely subjective though.
---
Well hasn't lied about this.
---
&gt; As whilst a game might be okay, knowing that the company you're giving money to is "morally bankrupt", to quote one reviewer, leaves a bad taste in ones mouth.
---
And that's the part where you lost me. First, I disagree that any company has "morals" -- people have morals. Companies have obligations to their shareholders. That aside, the idea that Bethesda is "morally bankrupt" is hyperbolic absurdity. Do you know any of the developers? Anyone on the team? Are you familiar with their morals? Are you familiar with their decision making process behind all of this?   Of course not. It's casting a value judgment on people based off of nothing other than "I don't like this."
---
Ok. Take an upvote
---
Wipe Todd‚Äôs jizz off your chin.
---
You are a true prophet! Now public server is VERY laggy.
---
Ik. This is just a spoof of that site
---
Well you have to be careful what you post here or Bethesda will eat it up and release a paid version of it. :&gt;
---
And also its not like Bethesda is doing anything productive lately...
---
There were 3 but they have been vaulted as of now.
---
Vault-Tec Paint
---
Camo Paint
---
Blackbird Paint
---
I Noticed that too lmao
---
Sounds good, I have some wares I can discount
---
Trouble is - if nobody is interested in buying the products you sell. And the public image of your company is falling apart I don't think you're going to be very successful selling an IPO or even the company. 
---
I've never understood the short sight mentality of these companies.
---
True, but then you can play with a different character abilities and make different choices. Much more replayability. It's not like Bethesda's Choice is adding the new new things all the time or had a great long story.
---
As long as people are PAYING they'll continue to support it imo
---
After monetization slows down by a certain amount the support will obviously be scaled back accordingly. It's just business underneath all the fun and games.
---
Ok. I understand you want to make a statement. But I‚Äôm wondering how much this update affected your gameplay that, as a major fan of the series, made you uninstall it.
---
For me personally if I weren‚Äôt reading this sub I probably wouldn‚Äôt have noticed the Fallout First icon button in the bottom right corner and continued my mary way.
---
It's a glorified invite only lobby minus the invite only part. No server features.
---
The premium skins and atoms are the main selling point of the subscription.  Most people dont want the private servers, they want the cosmetics and atoms. 
---
To give this away to non paying members is to slap the money in the face. 
---
If you want a game to die, the first thing you do is piss off the paying players.   This would piss off the paying players.
---
Businesses are not socialism.  They are the exact opposite.  What you suggest is a slippery slope towards digital socialism.
---
Comming RIGHT UP ! Careful, its hot !
---
Ignoring the microtransactions and fallout first what has been improved? 
---
Unfortunately most of the things we‚Äôve seen added where short largely forgettable quests  that where supposed to be taking the game to the next level and unless your a new player the additions aren‚Äôt noticeable. The game has been made generally grindier with legendaries and what not. By level 50 the only content you‚Äôll likely be using from the previous two ‚Äúexpansions‚Äù are vendors,backpacks (and that‚Äôs if make it through the horrible quest to abtain them), and a legendary vendor that when it dosen‚Äôt have a 25%-50% discount is nearly worthless.
---
who said that? do you have trouble reading? DLC wasn't the only thing that was mentioned. the cope lol.
---
I hear ya, I'm more dumbfounded by them removing Survival just to charge everyone to be able to PVP or NOT PVP if they want. But whatever, I'm still gonna play for free, enjoy your 5x more legendaries and extra fast travel spot
---
It‚Äôs like they all have gaming YouTube channels.
---
Wow i hope you haven't lost anything mate
---
How dare you be the voice of reason in these trying times &gt;:(
---
A few of us are, but overall we don‚Äôt care
---
Not being toxic, just as a gamer too i'm interested in this, if this doesn't stop most of our favorite video-game companies will start to do it too, it doesn't come at once, it's a long term planned thing, they aren't dumb, they know exactly what they did and what comes later, all for the money money money !
---
*Well one of those are abundant here*
---
Yeah youre completely right. I agree with you. I dont have to buy it and play it as i used to. 
---
But. And theres a big but. 
---
Once survival mode comes back, i'll know i'll be in disadvantage to everyone Who bought the subscription. They dont need to worry about weight as much as i do.
---
I wont be able to compete, ammo and stimpak wise.
---
They'll grow faster and better than me.
---
Thats the kinda Player i and many others are.
---
We like fairness. Everyone should go through the same trouble. Not pay to make it way easier.
---
You feel me, too?
---
the mods could be saved on to the console and put a cap on the servers as an example 5gb of mods on a server when they choose that server those mods get loaded from there hdd if people want too access lots of servers and want 1 terabyte of mods on there hdds they can,for 1tb they could access 200 servers how many server lists they want to access should be up to them
---
Might help if that unlimited space they sold you actually worked XD
---
You call it what you want, it's a ruthless cashgrab and I didn't announce anything. This is a forum and it's made to post what you think.
---
Why would I want attention from this lol. I can do 100 other things to get attention.
---
This was the rant i needed! Deleted my Bethesda Launcher to show my support :D
---
Seriously about to go to the store now
---
The core player base is still there and having a great time.
---
Like you I love the game....I hate the annoying glitches and crap but overall I keep logging in.
---
The robot voice tracks are amazing lol.....I LOL each time Modus talks and Sanjay oh man....good stuff.  The grind is great, crafting, and messing around with CAMP.
---
You can‚Äôt let forum negativity get you down just play your game man.  The posters in this forum are a very small % of game.  Believe me.
---
No it's objective, content is additions to the game itself not services alongside the game, if they added a map that would be considered contenrlt a private server again is not content
---
Yes! I‚Äôll start with PvP and PvE... 
---
I know a lot of great people in both communities as well as many who do both. None of the PvP‚Äôer for example troll lower levels and actually have a code of conduct so to speak in many games. 
---
Many that do PvP in Fallout never took any junk or stims in survival unless the other player was a jerk... 
---
Survival would have been a great mode but Bethesda messed up bad allowing the transfer of existing characters during the height of duping which they claimed was causing server issues. 
---
I think survival should come back as a game mode but will require you to create a new character and actually survive! 
---
No legendary items at all and resources that are far more rare or spawn less forcing players to trade or sell and to ultimately survive without having the option to go to a safe place as in another mode. 
---
Pve players and PvP players could coexist IF pacifist was actually a mode where you couldn‚Äôt take any damage by other players. 
---
Currently griefers throw nuke mines at you trying to instigate PvP. That in itself is just one reason why people have requested private servers! 
---
With that said, pacifist mode can‚Äôt be just turned off or on while in a game world. You‚Äôd have to set it before entering a world. 
---
It‚Äôs a win/win. No sense in griefing if they can‚Äôt be griefed... pve‚Äôers would be happy. 
---
World hopping... a huge difference I noticed with 7 friends is that there was no lag, in the private server... it was the smoothest I‚Äôve ever seen and experienced. I think Bethesda will look at this hard and limit players to switching worlds like a cool down period maybe. 
---
Stability overall seems to be one of the top complaints. Well limitations have to be made before growth unfortunately to make sure new things are going to work. 
---
(I‚Äôll write more)
---
Indeed very interesting
---
You might be mildly happy to hear they‚Äôre fixing the issue and looking into ways to give people their scrap back.
---
It‚Äôs worked just fine for me so far.
---
It's almost like the two games aren't really comparable...
---
Why should I listen to you?
---
I‚Äôm loving fallout 1st and if it funds the game to keep it from going offline then I‚Äôm happy.
---
Same. I just couldn't go on. Tricentennial Edition pre ordered. Beta player. Day after day grinding, waiting for the issues to get addressed. 1000 play hours. Cringing when survival mode wasn't Traditional FO Survival, vomiting in my mouth when PUB G...er Nuclear Winter launched, then private (not really private) servers launched with game features that most other publishers include for free, etc. 
---
Why a caps max, scrip max and stash max? To make us pay for something that isn't a bonus to the game. Charging us for features that were BLOCKED, not added. Wanna succeed at FO76? Pay for success, even though it was promised not to ever be that way. This relationship has a cheater in it, and an unfaithful liar that has to go. So its gone.
---
Well I mean you're still here, trying to what? Convince me you're right?
---
What is content?
---
"something [contained](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/contained) ‚Äîusually used in plural"
---
Private worlds are a feature contained within Fallout 1st.
---
" [SUBSTANCE](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/substance), [GIST](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gist)" Whether something is substantial is subjective. That varies from person to person. But anything added to the game is of *some* substance because it exists at all.
---
I would say this subreddit is more like the spouse of a substance abuser that has finally had it with being knocked around when their SO has had one too many microtransactions. And Bethesda should hopefully take this as a sign to get clean.
---
let me guess... you purchased subscrition, instantly refunded it and now some subs benefits are missing?
---
" [SUBSTANCE](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/substance), [GIST](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gist)" Whether something is *substantial* is subjective. That varies from person to person. But anything added to the game is of *some* substance because it exists at all.
---
So in a way you're right. It is objective. Private worlds exist. They are of (virtual) substance, and physical substance (a server somewhere) and they are contained within the Fallout 1st experience.
---
More fake news, I watched that E3 and he never said that.  Todd Howard has the biggest bestest words and may be in line to be President someday.
---
If you wish to continue to make jokes instead of actually defending your points then this is where the discussion ends. You can't just go around making false statements and expect not to be criticized. I told you the condition in which I would retract my statements.
---
The only conclusion I see is that you are either being paid to spout nonsense or you are just mentally ill.
---
I am always open to being proved wrong.
---
Well, you see, the community bought the game.
---
So, bethesda added the atom shop. 
---
Then the community bought cosmetics from the atomic shop. 
---
So, they added repair kits. 
---
Then the community bought the repair kits.
---
So, they added refrigerators and scrap bots. 
---
Then the community bought the refrigerators and scrap bots. 
---
The community has shown it is willing to pay for all of this and more with very little complaint. 
---
So, now there's a subscription, and the community, like it or not, is buying that too. 
---
Now I wonder what bethesda will add next.
---
Sounds good to me, excellent idea!
---
*Bethesda. My bad, making responses on two different threads. This and GR:B.
---
Statement still remains, BETHESDA needs to fix this or else they are gonna lose a lot of money. There's just too many MMO games, and although this is the only FO one, I don't think that the majority of players will fork out $160 ($60 game, $100/yr server) to play an MMO. Yes, the hardcore FO folks will, but eventually it'll die.
---
There kinda heavy once you have a few of them in your inventory also.
---
Appreciate the link. Many thanks.
---
\&gt; i know people will get every loot they want and basically have infinite ammo if you farm a few days.
---
Such a stupid thing to argue about. You can buy all that shit on ebay.
---
# Fallout 76 xbox one 5000 5.56 ammo 5$.
---
This is a real listing, right now. You are bitching about pay to win ruining your gameplay, when there has been pay to win since the very first day the game launched. You want thousands of stimpacks? A full set of cav armor, and a legacy two shot explosive weapon?
---
YOU CAN BUY IT ON EBAY!
---
How is that not pay to win?
---
Right? It's a business and we can't fault them for monetizing their game. Devs and employees need to get paid. I wonder if any of these haters work for free?
---
did you see yourself in it buddy ?
---
At this point I'm still responding to just not quit the discussion. I obviously won't get anything, but I repeat that I made the post to say what I think. And what are you trying to do? Convince me to pay for the 1st so I can support your wonderful corporation?

Uh... that page isn't the most played games. This one is: https://www.trueachievements.com/n39336/gameplay-chart
---
My only issue with this is dividing the player base. I enjoy interacting with all level players. Not to mention low level trader and mule characters that are traders.
---
I don't disagree at all and like how you share. I have an issue that it is a subscription. Unlocking this should be a one time fee if it is to cost anything
---
As a total fallout IP fanboy (shirts, posters bobble heads, ornaments you name it) I finally pulled the plug and uninstalled last night. Calgon take me away (from all this MMO p2w nonsense).
---
Released later, with real testers before the beta, the gameplay would have been at last decent.
---
Thanks man I appreciate it, will definitely be buying chems and such. If you make any Nuka Darks or Nukashine I'm most interested in those. Floopwood has an empty soda saloon. Yeah it's all the neg posters doing it
---
That sounds awesome! Mcpoyle82, I'll bring pie
---
its my go to site for when stuff like this happens
---
Most likely the hotfix, i would like more then 5 minutes notice as i lost vault raid because of that but I prefer critical bugs to be fixed asap over playing with them
---
Highly doubt it. Private servers were *always* going to be paid. And honestly, I‚Äôd rather pay $13 a month for that plus added benefits than just pay like $10 for adventure mode but alone or with 7 people of my choosing. 
---
WL will be free. Load outs will be free.
---
Could 1st members get access to content, well, first? Maybe. But the only thing left to do is sit and wait or speculate.
---
But it isn't "your own server".
---
It's "a rented service" and they can turn it off as soon as it ceases to be profitable. Now that might be fifteen years from now, or it might be fifteen months from now.
---
The argument then should be ways to help improve the experience and demanding stability. 
---
Constant world hopping, duping, glitches and more... have you commented on all this which all have been known to crash servers or severely hinder them?
---
&gt; Regarding recycled servers, Bethesda denied that players are getting used or recycled worlds. ‚ÄúWhen a Fallout 1st member starts a Private World, a dedicated world is launched on an \[Amazon Web Services\] server. Players who have seen looted containers upon login may be experiencing the expected behavior upon log out and log in. Loot is instanced for each player in containers. As *Fallout 76* players know, if you loot a container on one server, and then log out and log back in to another server, the container remains in a ‚Äòlooted‚Äô state for a period of time.‚Äù
---
I thought people were complaining about seeing looted CORPSES in their worlds. Pretty sure majority of the players understand how looting containers work.
---
This is so Obsidian can buy their property back. Fools. They'll make/will have made millions anyway you slice it.
---
And my corn!
---
Im down
---
YOU MEAN FOR A PASS THAT COSTS LESS THAN FALLOUT 1ST AND GETS YOU NEW VEGAS TO BOOT?
---
I‚Äôm not making back 6k acid, 20k steel, 5k lead and 10k plastic in an hour.
---
I've been lurking and even commenting for a while. I've been calling out people on that sunk cost fallacy for a long time. Bethesda tips their hand at you and NOW you all explode? Like this was some sort of mystery that was only just now unveiled to you guys?
---
Everyone that bought that stupid fallout first is getting exactly what they deserve. Bethesda proved this game was a defunct cash grab a long time ago. Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is?
---

Well buddy, I hope you're right, but I don't see it happening.
---
it still kinda is, but they are more trolls or bethesda‚Äôs sheep than anything.
---
You may not be able to see it as the poster buddy, but there‚Äôs a set of brackets under your post with removed written in it. So either you or a mod has removed the comment which read ‚Äòtold you so‚Äô.

Shill spotted

That‚Äôs pretty cool! I‚Äôm seeing trolls downvote our positive experiences... I didn‚Äôt realize kids had the day off from school...lol
---
Eh I‚Äôll give outerworlds a month till people see its flaws. They‚Äôll underplay and talk it up (because Obsidian). Majority will say it‚Äôs ok or it sucks and it‚Äôll be forgotten about. Die hard fans will praise its writing but ignore its flaws and we‚Äôll have a lesser fnv. 
---
Just my prediction could be wrong
---
Too bad that even if i go for a melee build, which i planned to, i wont be able to farm ammo.
---
I told you this many times and idk why you wont understand it. 
---
You play this game, right? 
---
Then you should know that you need to go out many times inbetween exp farming to get ammo.
---
Once you have the scrapbox, item management is easier. 
---
What dont you understand now? Its so obvious on how big the advantage actually is.
---
I bet i had over 300 lbs scrap. Imagine having 1100 lbs as a paying member while second class doesnt. Huge advantage. Especially if youre a vendor Seller
---
Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberry!
---
Who are you to determine what others should find valuable? If you don't value what they have to offer just don't buy it. Stop pushing your values on other people.
---
I can help if you can wait until about 10:00pm EST (~9 hours from now).
---
Instead of caps, we can just trade revives since I still have a character that needs it too.
---
IGN = Z0MG_H4X
---
If what they are saying about the servers are true then ill likely try it out.
---
At least they are actually fixing it.

You forgot to curse Bethesda because they stole your lunch money and kicked your dog. /s

I don't have too much mods for those guns, I'll see what I can do
---
Probably a mod. Oh well. Damage control away, mod team!
---
 Well as its a Bethesda game, and a new format for them I expected bugs. There were not many that I cared about and they fixed most of em'. I am generally not a quester in Fallout games. I don't follow the breadcrumb trail around much so many of the quest bugs don't matter to me.
---
 I like to build characters in Fallout games and this one is the best for that so far. My main is amazing and my other characters are great fun too.
---
 I don't care about expansions much, don't care about weight etc etc, I have the game under control and play it for fun. Last night I played with the Muties in Harpers ferry. Usually I sweep through them like a mostly invisible tornado, with knives. ;) I can kill the entire town and take little damage. This time I decided I would murder them with a different weapon each time so I had to run around a bit. Who am I kidding, I needed the steel. ;)
---
Imagine buying a cartridge and owning the whole complete game with almost no bugs!!
---
Maneuvering the dialog is gameplay. You're confusing taking an FPS over an RPG.
---
So abysmal that you cant forget about it and move on; instead posting here over and over again.
---
Unfortunately not, but I can repair it for free, just for not be able to mod it
---
Can only hope it's for good.
---
So far it is just a separate scrap box that you can access in both worlds.....the tent camp I believe is available in both worlds but i have not used mine yet...other than that you have a new icon, a new uniform and some emotes....I guess all of those things make me P2W because they make my character so much better
---
I‚Äôm not a massive fan of fast food, but if my wife and I went to McDonalds once a month and had a large combo meal each, I wouldn‚Äôt say we ate a lot of McDonald‚Äôs. 
---
And my point still remains valid... Fallout 1st is not expensive, even more so if you work out the annual price.
---
Hahaha. Thanks for the post. Some of this logic is a treat to read.
---
Wait people are charging for this?
---
I‚Äôll be out later but feel free to add me and we can try and hook up
---
If they don't fix stuff, you complain.
---
If they fix stuff, you complain.
---
Complain, complain, complain.
---
We'll see if they fix it üòÖüòÜüòÖüòÜ
---
People who actually buy this deserve everything they have coming to them and more.
---
It honestly makes my head hurt...
---
Another one of these posts üôÑüôÑüôÑ
---
Because Wasteland is home.
---
If you have a rifle build, making and scrapping Handmade, Lever Action rifles, etc is a good way to get rid of excess scrap while learning useful mods.  For XP I would stick with killing things.  Just my opinion.
---
&gt; Do not buy Fallout 1st 
---
Too late.
---
That's still less deceptive than "private servers", but yeah.
---
I ain't callin' you a truther!
---
What I linked is Microsoft's own official chart. Is that unreliable for some reason? TrueAchievements is a third party site using its own sampling method.
---
‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt buy it‚Äù
---
I didn‚Äôt buy repair kits, scrap kits, fridges, or collectrons either.
---
This is a mute point that has zero thought to it.
---
Okay...? Uhh.. well.. idk how to tell you this, but what are the odds of meeting a Player Who bought his stuff on eBay and meeting a player with 1st class status?
---
You get me? ;P
---
The thing is this is a free forum and they can't verify who actually pays and plays vs and average Joe.
---
Noone says you can't voice your opinion but it needs to be voiced where it actually matters.
---
since when do they ever fully tell us stuff? ive been relying more and more on data miners to find stuff out more than the devs themselves
---
I spent $12 to try private servers. Why not? It‚Äôs only $12. I pay that much for lunch every day. 
---
I also know that companies require revenue to stay in business. Dev‚Äôs need salaries to do their job. 
---
Why do people think that Bethesda can continue to make content or fix bugs without having ongoing revenue to support the cost of employee salaries?
---
Sure. Todd said such and such at that one time and another. Plans can and do change in business. Companies have to adapt or they go out of business. 
---
If you don‚Äôt like what they are doing stop buying their product. But don‚Äôt tell me how I should spend my money. 
---
Let the down votes begin.
---
Broke bitches always looking for free stuff
---
Because if he can't have it, nobody else can have it.
---
? I fail to see the comparison between the original post that refrigerators aren't "P2W", and the OP's dislike of the subscription service? The OP made valid points about how everyone interpreted/misinterpreted quotes about the Atom shop that I agreed with. 
---
I don't even know that I agree with **1st** being part of the "slippery slope" argument? IMO, it's an entirely different, and seperate monetization issue.
---
So, because they‚Äôre taking action to fix an issue, you‚Äôre mad?
---
Nope. I just don't think you should be shitting on people who do buy it.
---
FTW
---
This subreddit is and always has been infested with people that have hated the online nature of Fallout76; some dont even own the game. It is NOT a good place to make a decision on whether or not to buy it. It is by far one of the most garbage filled Subs that Ive been to.
---
Hahahaha
---
You're last sentence sums it up.
---
I considere Destiny a Money grab aswell, but for example WoW Delivered atleast a Game that you COULD Grind for 15 Years.
---
Fallout 76 Isnt worth 60 Bucks at its current state...
---
It shouldnt had a Atom Shop to begin with AND Is nowhere nearly good enough to ask for a subscribtion Model.
---
So what you're saying is that the game isn't making any money... so what we should do is get SUPER FUCKING PISSED OFF every time they try some new way of making money?
---
Yup here he is ^^^
---
What about your camp workshop?
---
It's actually very, very simple. Money, because they know people will pay. Nothin sinister here, they're making money. They don't care about you, they care about your money.
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you think‚Äù
---
Okay. Bye. Thanks for responding and getting defensive despite your lack of care. Very mature grown man.
---
I'm having a great time with it. Many of my friends that haven't played in months are coming back now that we can play in our own server. It's running smoother for me than it ever has. I've been playing since launch/ reclamation day. Last night we just killed each other , a lot. Built death mazes at workshops, didn't waste budget on extracting crap. So many flamethrower traps , and other trickery. Tonight we are gonna run some raids , and probably kill each other again.
---
Well you had so much obviously you didn't need it. You just want it. Why not enjoy the game? Instead of playing hoardjunk2019
---
All I see is a bunch of youtubers who claim they love gaming and games and then crap all over the industry they say they love. I don't get the complaining the value of everything in atoms with a private server. They literally just made videos to bitch cause of the really terrible launch, nearly all of them stated things like no updates ECT. 
---
Personally waiting till mod support is in, going to play rdr2 on pc. 100 a year or 8.33 a month that. We all k re private servers would not be free
---
It is your world just not really private
---
good to know thank you!
---
"You're not the boss of me!"
---
I bought all of that, twice. For me and for my husband. Sorry, not sorry.
---
Bye bye
---
Do they thou? Honestly? After reading some posts on this sub the last few days, I‚Äôm not so sure they do.
---
The Steam Workshop agreement allows Valve to monetize any workshop creation, even if you pull it.
---
Valve has been charging $1-$3 for keys to open crates in CSGO/TF2 forever and nearly everything in the crates is an optimized workshop creation.
---
Fissure prime, get some new legendary Sierra Bravos to spawn now. Although RNG is RNG
---
Hahahaha pitter patter
---
And where is that? Storefronts? Sending official tickets only they see and ignore? Twitter? Facebook? Bethesda's official forum?
---
We know they check the reddit threads and forums. 
---
It needs to be public, the more public it is the more it hurts, more it hurts the more urgent it is. If you don't say anything the problem won't go away, it'll just get worse.
---
i bought it for a month to try this morning just because of this post.  
---
who the hell are you to assume you know whats best for everyone and call people names?  how about you delete the game if you are that pissed off and stop posting here?
---
 #5- The Status Quo: Bethesda continues to aggressively monetize current and future titles in the same arguably tone-deaf way they have with Fallout 76. A vocal minority complains, a principled few boycott, and the general public at large buys in and carries on almost entirely unaware of the controversy.
---
It gets worse though because the invite only part doesn't work. Friends can just join if you want them to or not. Not much control to be had in these private worlds yet.
---
This can't get upvoted enough.  Lots of peeps are overreacting to clickbait youtuber fraudulent representations of the game or are misunderstanding the game mechanics ie. (thinking people are looting their bodies when the loot tables are rate limited).
---
we tried that last night and it didn't help.
---
Gfy...
---
I bought it, but I buy a lot of stuff. It‚Äôs only $100. That‚Äôs less than my hourly pay.
---
Better now ?
---
Probably have to buy mods with Atoms too
---
First born is their preferred payment, but they will settle for an arm and a leg.
---
Two options with the Excavator PA:
---
1) Full suit gives you +100 carry capacity
---
2) Both arms gives you double the ore you extract from any nodes.
---
So if you don't need the additional weight capacity, but maybe harvest a lot of lead and need the bonus - you can still mix and match the rest of your PA as long as both arms are Excavator.
---
I don‚Äôt care about broken psuedo private servers, poorly rehashed cosmetics from a vastly better game, a dinky tent, or a pay to win scrap box that can delete what you put in it.
---
I just think for a $60 AAA title that came out fundamentally broken and remains empty and boring to this day its laughable to ask for a $99 subscription service that gives you virtually nothing.
---
If they wanted to implement these features, they probably should have been for everyone and not locked behind a paywall.
---
If they wanted to offer a subscription service, I think they should have put something of actual value in it and waited until after Wastelanders.
---
I've seen corpses of enemies in game as they went from live to dead. No idea why they died, but they were devoid of loot since I didnt tag them. Same thing happening here. Its a bug, not a recycled server.  
---
there were mass amounts of posts claiming that loot boxes reset when you server hopped. They either dont know how the game works, havent played since release, or dont even fucking own the game.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between voicing your opinion and pushing a false narrative and making a post every hour that just says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving Bethesda bad‚Äù
---
Went hunting in the Toxic valley, set up mini camp next to an acid node, setup a resource collector, put up a industrial water purifier in a red puddle.
---
I just killed a Mirelurk queen while standing in a radioactive pool, then killed two Snallygasters and went hunting RadDeer and Yao Guai, stealth build with handmade rifle, slow and surgical.
---
Collected tatos and corn at some farms killing Super Mutants and hard sell mirelurks, ran the'Thrill of the grill' event and went back to camp to collect acid and make psycho with my harvested toxic soot flower and digested goo I collected yesterday at cranberry bogs around the Overgrown sundew groves.
---
This and much more, solo PVE, I love it!
---
it's pretty exhausting to have some vague form of activism pushed in to everything now. I enjoy f76 when everyone said I wouldn't. I enjoy the world and the gameplay when everyone was screaming it was shit. I'm just enjoying a video game.
---
Will I sub to 1st? I don't know. Maybe. It's not the end of the world. I'm 33, I don't have time to boycott every single game/dev/publisher Reddit et all says I should.
---
Get back to your server maintenance and off reddit.
---
Well this is how I wished the game launched, soon as I finish the revive friendly tadpole I‚Äôm in, sound freaking awesome being able to workshop and use the camp to come back to where ever you were
---
Oh my god all I see from this sub is CONSTANT bitching and moaning. Literally the story of the boy who cried wolf. You‚Äôve wasted all your outrage on cosmetic items and now it means jack shit while you become hysterical over an $8/month server rental. 
---
Congratulations, you played yourselves.
---
Never heard about this bug :O, how does it happened? Can't it be fixed by any means? Do you have a link to a video showing what this bug does exactly?
---
Don't worry, Bethesda will soon release their Fix 1st Membership, only for 15$ a month!
---
Lemme guess... you're a big fortnight fan, huh?
---
Everyone who actually paid Bethesda money for Fallout 1st is getting exactly what they deserve. Bethesda proved a long time ago this game is a defunct cash grab.
---
"Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact... same fucking thing... over and over again expecting... shit to change... That. Is. Crazy."
---
I'll leave that to the whales that bought the 1st subscription to buy the next one and praise them on all the content.
---
Its a fun game.
---
I don‚Äôt know why you are going out so many times to farm ammo lol.  I don‚Äôt understand the scenario you are trying to throw at me. I switch to melee and am able to accumulate all the ammo I need. If you don‚Äôt want to farm it you can always buy it from vendors directly. Yes I play the game. Close to 600 hours.
---
Well yeah, you're replying to them.
---
Yep, it's sad. I could maybe wrap my head around why someone might buy this, but to get it the day it comes out is blind stupidity. How can they trust they will deliver on what they say and it won't be bugged to hell (it already is) or that it won't go on sale a week later.
---
Last night we made a quest that ends with a player (we dont know) having to sing "country roads" on stage. Ran it a few times with random people.
---
One dude nailed it... Another was hilariously uncomfortable. 
---
I spend 100% of my time interracting with strangers.
---
\^\^ This
---
class action lawsuit anyone?
---
and how will you know if you're able to win again?
---
Same! That's the one from way back, it looks
---
Thanks rahter than just a rambling mess i prefer to open discussions where people can actually argue in a civilised manner rather than throwing insults at each other.
---
All DLC has been free up until this point. (Servers aren‚Äôt DLC - they‚Äôre a premium feature just like they would be with, say, Day Z on Xbox.) I understand and empathize with your doubts but don‚Äôt share them. I‚Äôm hopeful for your sake as well
---
Don't worry the media outlets are doing it for you. 
---
The only real course is what is the actual ratio between upset posters and paying customers. It sucks but till that changes. 
---
The strongest voice is a silent one no customers no players no revenue. Not all this free hype.
---
You can have 100000 angry posters but they weren't gonna pay anyway. Might as well make it for the 5000 that did
---
Holy crap man. Youre troll game is strong. I don't want to discuss this with you. I dont want to discuss anything with you. Personal attacks are not cool my friend. You and all you're little troll friends are exhausting. If i don't engage in your pointless rant about a game you don't even play that is somehow indicative of low intelligence? Ok fine. Im a dummy and youre an all knowing fountain of wisdom and knowledge because you watched some youtube videos that lined up with your predetermined opinions of this game. Sure. I think youre just a troll. However on the off chance youre not and youre actually this angry about this game... Idk man. Maybe focus that energy into something that matters. Regardless, this is my last reply, im not gonna feed you any longer. You're toxic. No thanks.
---
Bethesda probably made more money in the last 72 hours then they had in the past 6 months tbh
---
Different strokes for different folks...i am enjoying it lol. Thats my money which equals gear which equals enjoyment, it not hoarding if you sell it. I made 30k last night off of junk
---
I need to hit level 100 (I'm at 98) for my last achievement and then sadly I think I'll be uninstalling too.
---
Power Armor edition owner. I enjoyed the game for what it was, but I don't see the direction it's going as being a positive one. Was hoping for a Battlefront 2 style 180 in attitude and development.
---
The socialists of the world will never understand this.
---
This is just the opposite end of the spectrum. You‚Äôre giving your opinion, they‚Äôre giving theirs. Get off your high horse dude ppl are allowed to complain and be mad about something they paid for that disappointed them
---
the whole game has been brought down for maintenance over like 1 or 2 bugs just because those people were dumb enough to fork out an extortionate amount of money for a premium which shouldnt exist to begin with and it will probably be down for a while since usually these patches take hours to implement even if its so simple to fix
---
Wait, so you actually payed for the subscription?
---
I‚Äôm genuinely curious, why?
---
No but they aren't gaining anything either.
---
You are just as closed-minded as I am, you just think you have some sort of high ground in the matter.
---
If what Bethesda is doing is "exploitation", you could then make a case that any type of consumerism or capitalism is exploitation. I'm not gonna get into some philosophical debate with you about it.
---
You probably think that if people boycott the sub it will "send a message".
---
What you don't realize is that this game has business model, and the subscription is just a modification of that business model. Either their model succeeds and the game continues to make money, or it doesn't succeed and the game dies.
---
But this subscription model is literally cut and paste from ESO, and it is an extremely successful model in that game. This way of developing games is becoming the new norm, like it or not. If you don't want to support that, great, good on you. But it's pointless for you to try to shove your belief down everyone else's throats.
---
Dude, so get this. You can nuke a zone in server, farm it, leave server, go right back in, farm it AGAIN, repeat till bored.
---
Started playing The Outer Worlds last night. There's not much innovation there, but the storytelling and RPG elements are *so good* compared to anything I've played in years. Can't recommend it enough, especially if you're a fan of the OG Fallouts.
---
 Oh it runs better, as a non VATS user it has gotten better as a straight up shooter. The network works better and its generally better all over. Not surprising as they have had time to work on it.
---
 I have thousands of hours in the 3D Fallout games and I play em' my way. Leave vault, turn ... tosses coin ... left.
---
Sounds fun !
---
Well at least they're fixing something for the monkeys that payed for that crap.
---
No I mean Warcraft 3.
---
That's just how pissed off people are with seeing the news at different times.
---
Who are you to say they're not justified concerns? Who are you to say people are hopping on the train for the upvotes an generally not because they don't like it?
---
I've not been playing for months because i need NEW content, did everything i wanted to do. So should i  not voice how i feel about this subscription then? Even though it's stopped me from having a future desire to play the game?
---
I want to be treated as an individual, not as a dollar sign.
---
So accusing me to not have enough money after I wrote an honest and simple question to ANOTHER person is a better way of ‚Äûdebating‚Äú? Get outta here son
---
Fixing bugs that have been there since release? Not gonna happen.
---
Fixing bugs in our Failout 1st subscription? Two days.
---
Yep, featured in all the trailers, but missing from the base game, coming to an event near you! haha
---
Yes his Go daddy domain is pretty cheap, still a waste. Glad he paid extra $$$ for his domain info to be hidden... that cost more than a dollar...lol
---
EXACTLY!! some hidden new stories, quests, enemies... game design approach.... maybe something to actually try for or maintain. Some depth. They haven't touched the original content at all since launch really
---
im not your truther.. guy!
---
When you leave, how are you going to know if everyone else did?
---
You'd have to cross your own picket line to see.
---
Your doing the same. Clickbait will always be a thing. Just unsub and enjoy your game.
---
From what I found on that TrueAchievements site, there does not seem to be a clear explanation exactly how they calculate the ranking of the games, or what the numbers are based on. I do not know why I would take an unofficial source over one provided by the owner of the platform, unless I get a reliable (and verifiable) explanation why the former is better.
---
Well why don't you be the Janitor, the coder, the design artist, and marketing department all at the same time and see how well you perform! In all seriousness though it feels like the team in charge is about 1-5 people.
---
It's not the white one. Looks yellow to me. Unique to this event!
---
Funny your post was deleted... lol
---
Wait, you think the bug I mentioned is the only bug in Fallout 76? Oh god bless your soul.
---
If you want to be a dick, how about the endless loading screens people get multiple times per day?
---
$500 per month to praise others
---
I dont have a melee build yet, so im pretty weak with that. My AK does the most damage thanks to my rifle Perks. 
---
Caps are better used on rare scrap or legendaries.
---
600 hours? No wonder you lost sense of how casuals play the game. But yes, its very problematic for us noobs.
---
Do you think the price point is justified? $12/mo $100/yr just seems incredibly steep to me.
---
Unlike previous titles, FO76 requires servers to run round the clock. This costs money and requires upkeep. These costs are reduced by renting rackspace from AWS, but the cost is still there. If cosmetics aren't cutting it, and paid DLCs aren't an option, they have to look at other ways to pay that bill while also paying devs to develop new content.
---
Yes I paid for the subscription.
---
If im paying a premium my stuff shouldnt vansih. Im ok with paying just want it to work right lol
---
So do you get the costume rewards along with the base rewards?  Or is it an "either or" sort of deal?
---
What kept me playing for a really long time was that i could PvP along with being able to do all the other cool things fallout 76 offers like the normal quests and events. I really enjoyed building my camp around the idea that people were going to try and grief me when i got into PvP and went to my camp in survival. But all of that is gone now. PvP in fallout 76 has become pretty ridiculous and its really just disappointing. The game has got progressivly worse in my opinion and im going to buy modern warfare here in about an hour, not outer worlds like the media tells me too
---
Man, I kept talking about how much I wanted NCR ranger armor. I didn't even care if they added it to the ATOMS shop, as I had stockpiled a decent amount of currency from passively playing.
---
This hurts, man.
---
Bold of you to assume this game will have a future
---
Criticism is not by default toxicity. It's actually a healthy part of any system. The casuals sub comes off as a cult or an authoritarian regime where you're not allowed to be critical of the dear leader or you get punished.
---
To be fair, this game didn't deserve positivity. It was a trash mess of a game since launch and it still is. Rebid criticism yes, that's helpful, but positivity for a mess of a game, no.
---
And yes, Bethesda should be afraid. Because if their diehard fans don't get Fallout 1st, no one will. And honestly, no one should.
---
I understand a number of people are seeking it but my character is set up to heal automatically when I get low so bloodied wouldn't benefit me. So far I haven't seen it much but have in the past where I got several weapons. I will keep an eye out and start selling them if I get them next time.
---
I just subbed to counteract your -sub
---
Zenimax, TH and mngmt crew are the reason for this. Pure and simple. 
---
And President Dipshits brother being on Zenimax board shows the amount of greed pushing this catastrophe.
---
Those people better get a decent PC / console then, I have barely had one.
---
This exactly. I get why folks are salty that they were lied to. I guess I would be too if I had payed attention to any of those empty promises. But the game is still incredibly fun for me and has a little of everything I like. If I get bored farming, I can pvp or take out mobs, or launch a nuke, and when that's over I can build a new camp or start trading. Like I said, I get why people are pissed but I'm having too much fun to give a shit.
---
and the entire time i felt like Gizmo yelling "bright light! bright light!"
---
Do you play ESO? They have a dueling system which works really well!
---
I've gone into a private world and took the munitions factory and there was already x5 10mm ammo in it.. I'm assuming it was left over from another player. No generators or anything were left though.
---
It sure does a better job advertising the game than the ~~scrap shredder~~  scrapbox lol
---
 I'm a raving commie and I bought Fallout1 ;)
---
They‚Äôre working on a fix for it as we speak and working on a way to give everyone that lost junk in the scrapbox their stuff back.
---
It took 2 days for them to investigate, reinvestigate and implement a fix. 
---
This is what paid service can do for a game. 
---
Tell me again now how the subscription was a bad idea.
---
Without our wallets, this would have taken a month.
---
So I take it you haven't heard about the 100$ Broken as Sin Subscription yet?
---
I *know*.  They should've hired the community modders.   Maybe they did with Wastelanders, ha!
---
You're now playing Reddit76 which is fair enough, hope Wastlanders will rekindle your enthusiasm.
---
Bullshit lol
---
I bought 2 copies at launch for me an my friend to play, we quit around 2/3 months ago. Guilty of buying Atoms in the past too because i wanted to support the game, but in that time away, still an annoying amount of bugs, still getting stuck in my PA.
---
Now they want to charge monthly on a game you have to buy whilst being a broken mess?
---
No, i can't support that.
---
&gt;I heard a rumor you have to pay a subscription to play now although they promised before preorder that when bought there would be no season pass, paid dlcs etc. but this must be illegal, right? 
---
1. You don't need to pay to play.  It's more of a premium service but you can still play the game as you were (or in your case, not doing) before. 
---
2. If you were following the news around the same time, you might have seen that they planned on charging for private servers from the get go. Since PC gamer changed their article since Tuesday, I had to clip a bit from the original October 2018 article: [https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk](https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk)
---
I don't know why so many people glossed over this piece, maybe the hype of everything else and knowing that servers weren't coming till this year pushed that news aside, but it was at least announced that the server piece was going to be a paid service.  
---
And yes, cereal is a soup.
---
If the host of the private server disconnects then everyone does. You are not only dependent on the games horrible record of connection quality, but also at whims of some guys PC on top of that. My PC freezes sometimes, my internet goes out sometimes, not a lot but it's a factor. It's not like a private server in say Minecraft because those are persistent
---
I clicked on the video, now i wanna go watch stepbrothers
---
Well, you did assume it was going to fuck up...
---
Muahaha another one bites the dust in the meantime I'm over here winning since I have all this junk stored that gives me a clear advantage on pvp and pve fights, and what's best is that I have a robot that picks up scrap for me  so I don't even have to do it myself and weapon repair kit so I don't even have to use my valuable junk to fix my weapons, I'm and unstoppable Force of nature now going around the wasteland slapping people with my 30 bulks of steel on the face all the time...
---
they never do either of those things ever.
---
True.
---
I read it in that voice...lol
---
Outer worlds just came out Bethesda, and it has *great* reviews
---
This exactly. Everyone says the game is bad, yet if you actually sit down and talk to them they either haven‚Äôt played or played an hour and decided they had seen the entire game
---
I work 40+ hours a week and only spend money on games I think I‚Äôll enjoy. Reddit in particular is horrible about gatekeeping what people enjoy and pushing opinions as facts. 
---
Is Fallout 1st terrible? I mean you‚Äôre just renting a server for the exact same cost as any other game you can rent a server for. The only difference is you‚Äôre trading it always being available for some ok at best in game stuff. Everyone keeps blowing it way out of proportion. I saw several YouTube videos from Inside Gaming and Angry Joe etc that try to claim it‚Äôs a mandatory subscription to rent a server, even though it‚Äôs not
---
Will I buy it? No, because I have no reason to. Unless Wastelanders is spectacular, I don‚Äôt play the game enough to need a private server, especially since playing on a public server works just fine
---
Honestly, I doubt that's the case. Maybe give non-subs a scrapbox with another 800 limit or whatever - it'd be a very nice gesture, wouldn't it? 
---
Edit: Considering that, say, Aluminium scrap is an item and if they programmed it properly, then the amount should just be a number - they make a string together, hardly an impact.
---
/notouterworlds
---
Would you consider this an RPG or Looter shooter? Im of the mind that this should have been marketed as a looter shooter not an RPG
---
Coop fallout is nothing like 76. If they did a game like f3,fnv or f4 with coop people would have been much more happy
---
Some good suggestions there
---
No. Stop blaming people that aren‚Äôt upset like you. The exact reason is because people spend money.
---
Fair enough. I can see how somebody who frequents the atom shop would get their money‚Äôs worth.
---
And how exactly do they not piss off their users?  They tried selling nothing but cosmetics and no one bought anything, they tried selling novelty items and minor conveniences and people lost their shit... that only really leaves selling people actual p2w features or brand new content.
---
And do you actually believe you're hosting a private world on your xbox?  That's not how this works... you're still being hosted on the official servers, access to your world is just limited to you and your friends.
---
I mean Jesus Fucking Christ... I've seen a lot of bullshit arguments against the private servers but this one takes the cake.
---
Smartphones, timezones... (It's 7:30pm here :p)
---
I can understand that they needed money to work on future things, but they could've done that better, instead of this crap they could have created a "Fallout pass" like Fortnite/Rocket League , which can include unique cosmetics and those private seevers, some bonus for more time you play the game, like every 10 levels you make, you unlock something or earn atoms from that pass, ecc.
---
But no they decided to be greedy pigs and do this crap subscription.
---
I don‚Äôt hoarse in real life, just games. I get rid of anything I don‚Äôt actually use in real life, I don‚Äôt like a cluttered house.
---
Everything free after release!
---
Nah I was just talking about the analogy.
---
I know how you feel, this one guy beat me in a public event because he was able to carry 10K steel scrap in his stash while I could only carry 1K. This is total bull shit p2w mechanics.
---
I appreciate your brevity and concise approach, but consider trying for higher marks in creativity. Donkey and Son are possibly the most played out online insults.
---
A year ago Starfield and ES6 were two of my most anticipated games. At this point, I'd only buy them if they release with a 90 or above meta score, and even then I'd be skeptical as shit.
---
Don't see them fixing anything else.
---
The same way many other games do it. Create a quality product which results in good sales. Take part of that money and reinvest it into the game to generate customer retention and future income from DLCs sold. Instead, they released a shit product, fucked over their customers and then they try to monetize it. If they created a quality game and then charged for solid DLCs, no one would have a problem.
---
Why do you think the game had such low sales to begin with? Because the name Fallout is unknown in the gaming world or be because there wasn't enough hype? No, it is because what they released was total dog shit.
---
If you bought a car and they delivered it without the AC, the seats, the airbags, the doors, then continued to string you along for a year and after that told you you need to pay a monthly fee if you ever want to see any improvement I guess you would just thank then and take it in the butt like the good customer you are.
---
It's people like you, the apologists, who are part of the problem and why companies still think they can get away with these practices. I think you need to reexamine YOUR logic before you call out anyone on theirs.
---
Thank you for understanding that hard criticism is not an attack.  I appreciate it when people can have a discourse with different stances and not regress into attacks on each other.  Though thats a hard thing to do in todays digital world.  I am guilty of it myself, I dont count myself a saint, and know I step over the line sometimes too.
---
Begone shill.
---
All I know is every online game pretty much has a subscription service...this is how they raise money to keep games going and expanding for years like WoW.(what these guys are not patching this game I play everyday for years working for free!)
---
I help too, no worries lol, i just like my money and gear. And lol, im far from a hoarder in real life, just games...like probably most people whos played a previous fallout/skyrim game, or any other game that doesnt have stash limits.
---
How are you playing when the servers are down? Just sudo apt get The Outer Worlds
---
Lol no. Remember how long Todd was quiet after launch?
---
Only it's not. It's a 8 slot server 1 host 7 friends, and it won't appear unless the host is online and joins his world.
---
You're NOT getting a server. You're essentially paying to host your own lobby, similar to a client side hosted network game.
---
Isn't the point of a private server the fact that you go back to it and all your shit is in the same place?
---
Lol right on
---
Has it been anything other than hate?
---
4 times the size of Fallout 4! ^And ^4 ^times ^the ^monetization
---
You can‚Äôt see how that attitude and apathy are exactly why almost every AAA game is over monetized, under delivers on content, and why we have lootboxes, pay to win and so on? Not knowing but caring is one thing, willful ignorance is harmful, and puts one into the ranks of the ignorant masses/NPCs of real life. People who consume without question, and prop up systematic corruption. If you‚Äôre ok being among those ranks, that‚Äôs a real shame, too many people are complacent and screw things up for the rest of us who put in effort to be informed. That attitude lends itself to personal responsibility for the issues the industry has these days.
---
Well it is going to good use then. I have seen horror stories of people with 5 characters and all but one is overcumbered with 1.8k weight just steel and other junk. If that isn't the case then I backtrack on my comment. Just makes me worry about strangers when I see unhealthy habits bleed into games.
---
That's very true !
---
Oh yes. Also I love farming events, and hated when they brought in the public system, so this helps, and I love just exploring the world totally alone again. Idk man, it just feels, refreshing in the game for me again.
---
When you say Ak, I assume you mean handmade?
---
I‚Äôve played several characters. I remember what it‚Äôs like to start out.
---
You underestimate corporate greed, my dude. Companies don't care about people, just thier money.
---
What was the content that released around that time? All I remember was reading about that first dungeon they did and nothing else.
---
It's not my fault the developer promised free content. Hey if they sold 10 million copies for 60 each they could give content and run servers for years ,but they didn't so they couldn't do their promise. It's also the cost ratio. 100 is more than the friggin game which is $23 on their website right now. If I look at what content I get for $100 it doesn't add up. Please look at these factors before you say people just want it their way. They could have charged a one time fee, but they didnt
---
A*greed*.
---
What a game could have been is not a valid defense of what it is.
---
As long as BGS is owned by Zenimax, we can expect more of this. What we need is new ownership of the talen, and when I say talent, I mean the orgional BGS not these fake takeovers with the name slapped on.
---
You can't stand a bright positive post by someone who is enjoying the game, really sticks in your craw doesn't it.
---
You are a sad person, I feel sorry for you :(
---
https://www.polygon.com/fallout/2019/10/24/20930729/fallout-1st-private-servers-glitches-bugs-problems-scrap-box-pc-ps4-xbox-one
---
why are everyone at bethesda idiots? Why would they announce this broken shit AND THEN RELEASE it broken the same week? Fucking Crack heads over there i swear.
---
Lol, i assumed it was going to work....so yes i was an ass in that dept üòÅ
---
That implies Take 2 had consumer trust in the first place.
---
&gt;doesnt read the part of the qoute that says no season pass and ignoring the evidence that says the "private maps" aren't that or even new instances
---
They're in maintenance rn to fix the scrap box. I think that will settle down the outcries from those who bought the subscription. As for the outrage from all the neg posters who don't even play the game? Don't think they'll respond to them much
---
I anticipate it coming.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they're letting the subscribers test things out before implementing something similar for everyone - like the bugs with the excessively filled scrap box we're seeing right now.
---
Those who are willing to pay are also likely the most willing to be patient with Bethesda and so the most useful testing group.  They were talking before about wanting to implement test servers for new features... seems the private servers would be the best place to do it.
---
Well that is good to know. Not imperative to me but good you are healthy there. My mom was a hoarder. She broke it finally recently but it was a struggle.
---
I've been trying to duplicate this bug and can't get any scrap to disappear.
---
Can anyone who's had it happen post a video or even an explanation of how I could duplicate the bug?
---
I've loaded my scrap box with a few hundred steel and wood and joined back and forth from public and private and even joined public from the social tab... can't seem to duplicate the bug.
---
I want to know how the bug works so I can avoid it.
---
I wholeheartedly agree that the sub model is the appropiate model, considering dedicated servers and all. I think it should've been implemented from the get-go, really. Just not entirely happy how they've gone about it.
---
Yeah and you could try to either stay out of a question or add something useful, not a stupid ‚Äûargument‚Äú like ‚Äûlolz u don‚Äôt have money‚Äú. With that being said, have a nice day, SON.
---
Then quit... or are you an addict?
---
I have left t60 arm. A raider helmet and chest piece and than t51b legs and right arm lol
---
U mad lol
---
No. They will keep their mouths shut and sell the whales some other thing in two months.
---
That's right, but there stills being possibilities after all.
---
 Well they are all looter shooters, well to me anyway as I will not use VATS. I do my looting and shooting as a specific character I create so that's my RP I guess.
---
 This way I can play the silly game as a variety of characters and in different ways as they have different skills
---
If someone joins and you don't want them there, simply block for session. It immediately kicks them from the server.
---
Did it as a joke to a friend when he told me he was running a bloodied melee build while wearing Vanguard armor.
---
Dam bro you totally won!
---
Cya
---
You can collect Super Mutant heads as well. All the different part weight 1.0 if i remember correctly.
---
Yeah, handmade. Sorry, my game is in german so idk english names. 
---
Starting out and knowing the ins and out of a game are 2 different things, really.
---
NEWS: Bethesda Payed of by Blizzard to release this shit hole just to take pressure of their own PR disaster. Bethesda took the money happily, stopped development on their new service halfway through and dropped it on us.
---
Why are you trying to defend this?
---
Bathesda originally said all game play features would be free then they go and charge money for private worlds...that are just reused servers that are looted. And the pay to win junk storage box (that they said we could not have infinite storage because of server issues but they can sell you them) isn't a little bugged it's completely broken
---
people bought NBA 2k20 and was one of the top-selling games on Steam.
---
lol can't wait until all these neg posting astroturfers leave like you, my guy
---
ESO has been out for years. It was a disappointment at its launch but through years of hard work and dedication to improvement its actually a game worth playing. It has more content in one region of its massive map than Fallout 76 has put out in a year.
---
ESO plus nets you free access to every DLC, more in-game currency, a 10% buff to a lot of things, and essentially doubles your inventory.
---
Its completely laughable to compare these two games and probably insulting to ESO.
---
This is such a wonderfully positive post such a relief from all the depressing grinding negativity. I haven't pulled the trigger on Fallout 1st yet but your experience is making me tempted to give it a try.
---
It‚Äôs a subscription for a private server that doesn‚Äôt affect you in anyway. The outrage at the level it‚Äôs at isn‚Äôt justified.
---
Saying it‚Äôs a dumb idea is fine. Bashing the game and spreading false information like it being mandatory is the problem, as is the unnecessary reposts that just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done Bethesda bad give me upvotes‚Äù
---
Nothing wrong with having an opinion on it, but we don‚Äôt need the exact same post several times every hour crowding the feed. If it weren‚Äôt popular to bash 76 right now the amount of them would be greatly reduced
---
Enjoy it when bugfixes become a premium subscription. Because hey it's not a charity right?
---
Like this?
---

---
But yeah I‚Äôd have enjoyed an ITV where they talk about this butttt I like that they went into hotfix mode instead
---
I feel like the outfit is okay as an exclusive but I agree that the scrapbox should've been available to all players.
---
How does bethesda's dick taste?
---
The survival tent makes exploring the game wayyy to easy in my opinion. If theres a boss enemy up ahead, just drop the camp, deposit your junk then go die and respawn without paying caps. Its boring.
---
Just...pay to win, bruo.
---
It really is a great idea, one of the most unique we seen. It's just Bethesda DID NOT CARE enough to make it come to light. They made all these false promises because what they want more than ANYTHING (even this community) is your wallet, Plain and simple. I don't know why a company like that deserves any support. This is not the last time you'll hear something outrageous coming from Bethesda, just keep that in mind.
---
Things my friend and I have discovered about Private Servers
---
1. They're "Semi-persistant" meaning you have about 20-30 min of disconnect time before you're put into another world. 
---
2. Day 1 was insane. Legendaries out the wazoo (with decent rolls) yesterday, not so much. With 3*s dropping 1* weapons and armor.
---
3. This is something I personally take issue with. The "Survival Tent" is effectively invincible. My friend and I tested it you can hide in the tent and the red triangle that hovers over an enemies head disappears (red dot stays on conpass). The person inside the tent can see outside, but not the other way around. Nobody can shoot through the tent. But it does give someone the ability to quickly place an invincible structure in a pvp "match"
---
So far that's it.
---
FYI: Atom not Adom.
---
My issue is the Survival (PVP) servers were free, then they took them away to later charge for private worlds, seems like we're losing free content and gaining player feedback ideas that cost money. I wont be suprised if Wastelanders is Fallout1st members only or costs $10-20 now that they have a grip on everybody.
---
Ultimately, it's not going to matter because I am sure in the ToS / EULA / whatever it says that you agree to everything they're doing. Im gonna go play Outer Worlds, from the people who know how to make a great Fallout RPG.
---
How many players do you think think like you? This would go a long way in explaining things to the 1n2 fans like me.
---
This posts leads me to believe people will find any reason to be upset about something.  It might be time to lay the title down and move on to something you enjoy more, whatever that may be.
---
First I've seen of someone pointing that out, I'm on PC and switched from consoles for that very reason. Why would I want to pay $110CAD and then $130CAD(TriCentEd.) a year for the privilege of a shitty private server. To also have to pay just to get online with a game as well is insane.
---
As long as they keep my snazzy outfit out of the Atom store, I'm fine with it. ;)
---
As to your edit.  I agree, it should be that easy.
---
But this is Bethesda, when is anything ever that easy?  If it was that easy we wouldn't be dealing with bugged scrap boxes
---
Thanks Dad!
---
They fix the issues the paying customers have first.  They are the ones that paid for the support, so they get their issues fixed first. 
---
If you have an issue and want it to be handled ASAP, pay money.
---
I don't feel that the impacts are great enough to call it pay to win.  No one goes after any other game where you can pay for expanded inventory as one of the pay to win mechanics (Like Path of Exile, though it's been a long time since I played). 
---
And with all the red rockets and other storage options around the world, I don't feel like the tent is THAT dramatic
---
Not to say I don't think everyone should get them, I think they should, I just don't think they are that impactful. At least not to the level of games with "true" P2W mechanics where you can outright buy weapons that are stronger than anything you can buy in the game.  
---
I mean, what makes you win more in FO76 - unlimited storage or a high quality bloodied weapon?
---
This game is a dead man walking... abandon while you can and save your money for better  games
---
&gt; Fees pay wages and "keep the lights on" as it were.
---
If this were true every single-player dev house would have folded.
---
I figured it would be too OP if it had a scrap bench. You can already scrap your junk just not your weapons in the scrap kit.
---
&gt;except you actually lost because you gave bethesda your money like a fucking idiot sap/sheep.
---
Hm? No I mean everything with the costume tag you can wear to the event to get the bonus. For example I'd like to know if the sheepsquatch mascot outfit works.
---
I think Bethesda did a great job at showing what kind of support you can get with a paid subscription. 
---
Once you start contributing to the Dev's paychecks then maybe they will start fixing your issues.
---
Do you buy Bethesda games?
---
I hear the Fallout 4 servers are a lot cheaper to run though.
---
But the games free, the sub is pointless for most people as junk is near worthless and only provides ammo crafting late game. Most players use free repair kits to repair all their gear.  You‚Äôd actually save more money by playing FO76 for free...
---
I‚Äôd say price it higher than that to be more in line with other utility items at least - maybe 500 atoms - but I agree it should be open to the public. It‚Äôs also in line with where I think they‚Äôre going with this - ‚ÄúFirst on 1st,‚Äù a bunch of new items released to 1st members, well, first. I‚Äôd hope utility items aren‚Äôt a part of that but I‚Äôd be ok with it this one time. 
---
NCR outfit, don‚Äôt care where it goes honestly. Just glad I have it because it looks cool.
---
I still play once in a while, but yes it does not make an exact fit for me. üòâ  
---
There is actually not much out these days I do like.  Gaming industry seems stagnant.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me what to do‚Äù
---
Same.
---
" I don't have Fallout 76 "
---
super exciting post then
---
I do well enough for my family that $100 a **year** is not that big a deal.
---
I mean... Even a minimum wage job should afford you to easily soend under $9/mo for a digital service.
---
Xbox Gamepass Beta on PC is 5 bucks and has Outer Worlds. Why the hell would I pay more for a PART of a game that still doesn't deliver what was promised at launch a year ago...
---
People were begging for private servers literally days before they released, and then as soon as they released people complained.
---
I have been with this community since before the BETA and will never understand it.
---
I did monthly to try it out. I cant afford yearly but if I could, I would in a heart beat.
---
Similar for me but it was over game stability &amp; lack of solid end game.
---
I'd be happy to settle your dislike of how I choose to spend my money in game via some good old fashioned pvp.
---
*raises hand*
---
Clearly I‚Äôm not going to understand this as I don‚Äôt feel affected at all but other people buying the subscription.
---
Bitter whiskey man.
---
lulz.
---
Can you craft me 20 Handmades and 20 Combat rifles? Lowest Level is ok
---
EVERYONE who bought the game is a paying customer, why not fix the blatantly outstanding issues in the game  as well and release them with this patch because bear in mind, bethesdas only getting that $12 1 day a month which is less than it costs to buy the game and since most people didnt buy into it, theyre not going to be getting very much from it in comparison to people just buying the game.
---
Try more exclamation points next time
---
It is not just about the game. It is about the fact that people got ripped off. They bought a product that was broken and they were not allowed to return it. They had been misled and deliberately lied to. Is this enough, or should I continue?
---
A lot of game mechanics would have made more sense if they'd built it for offline first and allowed people to host servers that other players could connect to. Player data would be stored on the server, which would allow for a lot more modding options, since you wouldn't need to worry about people gearing up on a 100x drop rate server and then switching to a vanilla server. You'd also have real persistence this way, since the world files would be saved across sessions. You could support multiple or collaborative CAMPs, etc. Since most people probably wouldn't be able to host 24/7 servers for their friends, Bethesda could have further monetized the game by hosting servers at a slightly inflated price a la Realms. 
---
I feel like they built around this concept of funneling people into ephemeral instances without fully considering the consequences, and that's how we ended up with so many janky mechanics like losing all your workshops if you get disconnected or losing your CAMP placement if something's in the way when you join. So much data that should be attached to the world is attached to your player -- or not saved at all -- because you're on a different server every time.
---
If you don't have, and have never played Fallout 76, then why are you even in this subreddit
---
The paying customers already got a response from Bethesda in response to this controversy.
---
They fixed our issues in a day.   Because we paid them to.
---
For some reason I kept thinking they would pull a No Man's Sky and turn the game around. With Wild Appalachia they started to get on the right path - but then they discovered that their playerbase can be milked like cows.
---
And why do you believe they should be praised for this
---
Yeah, and about 4 posts above yours is an alphabetized list of those.
---
I could if I had enough screws, I could do as much as I can. If you give me materials it will be for free.
---
Show me on the doll where I hurt you.
---
Lol you mean like people paid hundreds of dollars for power armor editions? I do the same when my house is on fire i feed it wood and gasoline solid strat lets keep the shitshow going
---
They can't win on this sub. They make a mistake and this sub goes nuts.  Then when the hotfix comes they scream scout servers being down.
---
At least some of the activism popping up lately has an actual cause worth supporting.  Imagine two groups of angry protestors meeting in the middle of the street...
---
Group 1: Blizzard is stifling speech in service to an oppressive totalitarian government and we're not going to take it any more!
---
Group 2: Bethesda introduced a subscription service and we're not going to take it any more!
---
Group 1: Wait... they did what?
---
Group 2: A subscription service!  Can you believe it!
---
Group 1: So like they're locking all the new content behind a subscription fee?
---
Group 2: Well... no, we're still getting all the actual new content for free, the service just provides some conveniences and access to a private world to play on... what were you guys here for again?
---
Group 1: Oh... any day now China's about to launch a brutal crackdown and murder a bunch of people in Hong Kong and we're kind of pissed off that Blizzard is indirectly supporting that so they can make more money.
---
Group 2:  Yea, we're pissed about our stuff too.
---
Medalion's humming. Must be a Foglet.
---
My what a conspiracy theory that is.... unfortunately anyone who is actually interested can easily check OPs posting history and see they were in fact active in multiple Fallout subs so there's that. Basically this is what a moron thinks to be a big brain way of dismissing people's frustration without having to actually deal with the merits of an argument. It's just a piss poor plagiarization of the no-true-Scotsman "everyone talking shit on FO76 isn't a real player!" Laughable!
---
I'm not really into the action RPGs myself, but I do really consider a bigger inventory to be an advantage - so I'd definitley say it's a pay 2 win feature in PoE - I'm guessing there are legitimate reasons in that game to hoard stuff. 
---
I think the collecting and crafting/building is a huge part of the modern fallout experience, one which I really enjoy and it does give an advantage in that department equal to the advantange my bloodied handmade has over my mutant killer assault rifle.
---
The ability to just pick up everything with the search icon and throw it into the scrapbox - so much less stress, I love it and I wholeheartedly belive that everybody deserve that. Atleast to an extent, I don't think it has to be unlimited for everybody - but everybody should have a scrapbox, in my humble opinion.
---
Can I ask, have you even played Skyrim, Fallout 4 or Dark Souls more than a few hours?
---
Sounds a little light on the price to me for all that wonderful garbage. I mean wheres the pricing that asks for your first born or for you to mail them part of your privates every month, I heard there was even a pricing listed for sending them boudoir photos of yourself in compromising positions so they can blackmail you at a later date into buying more of their crap!
---
Yeah, more power to them. Lets just hope bethesda wont mess up AGAIN. But im sure they know how to treat their fans..... right?
---
Getting significantly more legendaries on the private server, even at workshop defend events is P2W. But that doesn't even bother me; However, I do think it's ludicrous to put in an NCR Ranger outfit, across the country, 85 years before the NCR was even formed.
---
I spoke of nothing regarding enjoying the game. It's not about enjoyment. It's about the ethics of their development and treatment of you, the player.
---
It's toxic because it's justified.
---
Toxic? Omg, that's adorable.
---
You should try out League of Legends sometime lol.
---
Makes me wonder how many people are paying for the subscription just to simulate playing offline.
---
I agree on both points mentioned
---
The only real reason that people are mad is because this is considered DLC. Bethesda promised that there would be no DLC that you have to purchase.
---
My auto rifle guy is not stealth, but stealth does work well.
---
I would find a decent melee weapon and use that for easy clears...use rifle for stronger enemies.  That way you do not waste precious ammo in early game.
---
Late game the ammo is coming out of my ears but I also have to spend a few hours side farm iij ng to make it.
---
I Uninstaller it also. I like the game, there's nothing wrong with it. And that we now got private servers is great. Of course they cost some, which is fair.
---
But I'm more to the regular fallout, so I haven't spend much time in this lately. So I uninstalled it because I needed space. Not because they made a subscription that I isn't forced to pay for to play the game.
---
Who is still actually "farming" karma on reddit in 2019. What are they gonna get a special prize for farming crocodile tears?
---
&gt;Bethesda has quite literally done the worst thing they could do for Fallout 76 by charging for a half assed subscription model with definitive P2W elements
---
It would be beyond dense to think all of this isn't related. It's no wonder they went balls deep with a P2W subscription service on a $60 AAA title when they got to essentially have their way with shills like you lol
---
The idea of a subscription service itself isn't even that bad.  It gives you a decent amount of atoms, and a few cosmetic items, fine.  But then they kept you from accessing game features unless you pay a fee, and that is the thousand pound straw that broke the camel's back.
---
*Gilded by a Bethesda employee*
---
And they're not even private servers.
---
I'm 73 and I will defend this game, as I really enjoy it. Reddit has been fun too over the last couple of days. Massive stupidity is what we do best. I suspect we are actually comic relief for an austere  universe.
---
That's a really smooth brain you got there, friend.
---
I bought the year.  Little hesitation.  I do still plan on playing this for a year.  After that?  We'll see.
---
Literally no one is being forced
---
Right here, please direct all harassment to my DMs
---
What controversy? 
---
Played for a few hours last night and it was pretty much a flood of Fallout 1st Emotes and Clothing.  They got their answer loud and clear and it didn‚Äôt come from this sub.
---
&gt;and now this...
---
Fallout first has done nothing to change the game play, everyone needs quit acting as if somehow they are unable to play a game they ejoyed
---
No shit.
---
This is probably the stupidest and most pathetic try for a troll post I‚Äôve ever seen.
---
Ahhh....I see now....one of those games from the early 2000 that run off windows 4 and take limited server capabilities...sure I can see that being possible since it would take like 2 people to maintain the title...You are comparing an almost 20 year old title with 20 year old technology to today's technology and games.....that is rich!!
---
It's still more-or-less the same thing it was when you left.  There's nothing mandatory about the 1st Pass. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I hope Todd sees this, bud

You‚Äôre talking to a brick wall. They‚Äôre charging you to keep the game online because it‚Äôs a dead investment in their eyes.
---
I agree üëçand vault raids in private servers are soooo smooth. Expert feels like standard now
---
Because I don't care that my spending money on something may entice a company to continue charging in the future?
---
Life ain't free...keep praying you get someone in the white house to forgive your loans or pay you $1000/mo for nothing...
---
Or, work harder... Earn more... And stop crying like the world owes you everything, because pal of mine, the work don't owe you a goddamn thing...
---
I would give my suggestions, but they are probably going to put them behind a paywall.
---
Okay, Todd. Now get back to (not really) fixing the game.
---
Found it. Here's the text of that post from another sub. The title stated that this was on a private server:
---
&gt;I‚Äôve nuked Whitespring and Morgantown. WS twice. Both times there the ghouls were all dead when I entered and it glitched so nothing would respawn.  
---
&gt;First time this happened I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do so after 30 minutes I left the server.  
---
&gt;Second time I left the server but reconnected after 30 seconds and bam! All the enemies spawned correctly. I went through and killed them all. Disconnected for 60 seconds and there they were again. Same server with nobody else there, just my nuke zone, so I went through again as payback for my initial attempt.  
---
&gt;Waited 5 minutes before reconnecting a third time and the server was gone and I was on a fresh one.  
---
&gt;Tells us that likely the servers countdown is probably 90 seconds. It also tells us that we can get a few runs in on our own nuke.
---
Noone is debating it cheaper to play for free.
---
Those of us that paid understand the value of money.
---
We understand that people dont work for free, and could care less about feedback from someone that isnt putting food on their tables.  
---
They responded by taking no more than 2 days to fix issues identified by the paying playerbase.
---
This thread literally points out how Bethesda lied about content being gated behind a paywall.  That's why people are mad (well aside from just having content gated behind a paywall at all).
---
Yep, if you read it directly from Bethesda's post you'll see most of it, here i'll copy and paste;
---
"A Private World holds a total of eight players and must be started or joined using existing characters. Only the owner of the world is required to be a Fallout 1st member, and they can invite Friends from the Social menu to lead them into a game. Alternatively, Friends can join a member‚Äôs world from the Social menu if the owner is currently playing on it. When the owner leaves their Private World, it will remain active if at least one guest is a Fallout 1st member, otherwise, the game begins a shutdown timer,"

Uh... what? It's literally the [first thing listed](https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1187036397263347713/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc^tfw|twcamp^tweetembed|twterm^1187036397263347713&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vgr.com%2Ffallout-76-subscription-fallout-1st-outrage%2F).

The word police
---
When did you request a refund?
---
Edit: I've never tried this, but you may be able to file a complaint with your state attorney general. Assuming you're in the US. I'm waiting for them to respond to my request before I do this.
---
It‚Äôs a decent way to raise revenue to keep the fame going. Private servers were never ever ever going to be free. Without the added benefits it would‚Äôve just been ‚Äúadventure mode with friends and no one else‚Äù and definitely not worth $10 a month. $16 worth of atoms, exclusive Atomic Shop content, and added features (one of which should be released to the public as a utility item) make it worth it to me. If it‚Äôs not worth it to others, that‚Äôs fine. All that matters to me is if *I* like it.
---
poor boors
---
FO1st is in no way required, the game is still very enjoyable.  If you or the way enjoy atom shop purchases, then the sub might be worthwhile as it‚Äôs cheaper to have the sub then to buy straight atoms.
---
If you send me 12$ every month I can guarantee:
---
- I‚Äôll deliever a crappy experience no matter what, 
---
- tell you I‚Äôll correct this in near future, 
---
- send you a useless piece of crap to distract you - for fun let‚Äôs call it Meat week - 
---
- if you‚Äôre unhappy, I‚Äôll send it to you again... 
---
- by accident unload all you inventory in a deathzone you can‚Äôt enter when you roam the world
---
I could go on and on, but by now it would be completely pointless
---
You'd have to ask them.  Doesn't make sense to me either
---
Well it is their own game engine, it might be some redundant system not really fit for a MORPG such as 76.
---
I have often thought about if FO76 is just a prototype for their true masterpiece, because this game truly is a diamond in the rough.
---
What they delivered isn't what anyone thought they meant by "private servers".
---
lol that's quite a reach. Keep blindly defending a company that has broken promise after promise and locks features behind pay-walls.
---
The ethics or a for profit company seeking a profit?
---
There's a reason pretty much every successful online game out there is either pay-to-play or pay-to-win.  The costs for the company don't stop at release, it's expensive as crap to maintain and every time you log in you cost them money.
---
There's nothing unethical about what they're doing.  They're charging for an option service.  If you don't want to spend your money on it, fine.  But that doesnt make it unethical
---
That‚Äôs not the actual website btw
---
All the outer worlds posts get to ya?
---
It‚Äôs a mix. There are people who are negative to be sure, but there have also been many positive celebrations of the games strongpoints. There has also been entirely due and apt criticism from time to time. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call it a beacon of positivity on its own, but it certainly is more positive than many places. 
---
I also never felt the need to seek out FC, because just using the meme _filthy casuals_ implies someone who‚Äôs far more of a serious gamer than myself.
---
Again, it's not a server.
---
Lol. I doubt you'll move that much scrap a day. Your npc vendor is limited to 1400 a day, and each player is capped at 30,000.
---
Again, you still have to scavenge the scrap, and your argument only remotely begins to work if you're moving scrap faster than you can collect it. Spoiler alert: you can't. Not even with player vending. And again, you still have to spend the time collecting scrap. 
---
And I'm sorry, but fast travel costs are measly. 30 caps when you're carrying 3k, 10k + is nothing... You make those caps back before you even get inside westek.
---
Its not a good shooter. Fallout 76 is far better there.
---
They're not private. You pay to get private access to a playspace. That's much different than what a private server actually is, which is a persistent world when logged in or logged off.
---
Furthermore, people can still join private servers without invites. That's not private by definition.
---
Just saying "private servers" doesn't mean anything
---
The only people I mock, blame or insult is Bethesda. Its really sad though the amount of comment's i've seen trying to defend and rationalize their bullshit though. IF you are one of the MANY defending these antic's I dont feel sorry for your being mocked or blamed or insulted. Harassment is bullshit though and NOBODY should me messaging you personally about it.
---
To be fair, 95% of the people who bought the game *already left* a couple of months after release.
---
If 95% of the people that still remain leaves, you wouldn't have enough people to fill a server.
---
How about you let me worry about who's taking advantage of me. Literally no one asked punk ass redditors to stand up for the greater good and fight. No one asked for a bunch of slack jawed yokels to run around screaming profanities and attacking othe players to make their point. All your doing is making the entire community look bad with foul behavior and borderline harassment of individuals who have no ties to Bethesda. You have done nothing to your supposed target, Bethesda.
---
Don't hate Fallout. Hate capitalism.
---
And btw, was there ever 1 Fallout without bugs?
---
Wow... you think people actually bought scrap kits?  Spending actual money to save all of that precious precious junk that they could otherwise just... you know... go pick more of off the ground?
---
And repair kits... like the free ones you get just by playing the game?  I've got like 80 of the things sitting in my stash gathering dust and I don't even try collecting them.
---
And you NEVER ONCE stated you host it on your own console or connection?
---
&gt; I have to pay, to run my own world, on my own xbox/PS/PC? No. Absolutely not.
---
I'm mad that they made what should have been items for the general population only available for a RIDICULOUSLY HIGH fee, took the game down for 5 hours to do so, then 2 days later take it down again to fix a bug in said items.   Im mad that they lied about intending to so so.  I'm mad that they release buggy shit every time something is added to the game, including and especially events that simply dont work.  I'm mad that they haven't released any significant content in months, and pushed back the content they promised.  Mostly I'm mad that a game that I really enjoy playing is getting worse, not better, in both reliability and balance of experience.
---
Pretty sure it is, ya wanker. Now let's piss off to the pub so we can get straight pesh'd, mate.
---
These are all event rewards. Nothing here is atom shop. The pirate costume is named for atom shop in the files but they must've changed their mind and made it an event reward.
---
üòÇ that is a perfect response.
---
Uhh what? If you don't Like something dont buy it. And whats whit the npc bullshit again? It's like people are in echo chamber. It's not a singleplayer game... It will never be a singlepayer game. Let it dog. Wtf is wrong with people these days. So fucking entitled.
---
Yeah but you can now farm for one in a private world, where you don‚Äôt have to compete with anyone. You can hold all the workshops, hit all the resource and legendary farming spots, and everything will be there for just you. AND, you‚Äôre going to spend less on fast travel to do it. You could also close out your world, and re-open it to farm for stuff like the Hunter‚Äôs Long Coat (5-7K caps at player vendors, as its only obtained through a specific RNG encounter with robot vendor). With your unlimited junk, you could stockpile resources and sell them to non-first members, allowing you to buy better gear off of players. 
---
**It goes like this: Paid advantage -&gt; Less work done by the player to obtain in game currency -&gt; better gear acquired than the average player. $100 per year.**
---
This gives you a paid advantage. This is why people are mad.
---
Is he havin' a laugh?
---
Sure jan
---
Aren't they privately traded not public, so a stock scheme would be kind of pointless?
---
Doing drugs will mess with your mind and prevent you from seeing things clearly...

" making Callus Decisions "
---
I already dealt with him in Destiny 2 TYVM
---
Exactly. And there's a LOT of people who don't play the game who have been flooding here in the past day or so to reap some easy karma by posting "DAE falout 76 is a bad gaem upvotes plz!" and getting thousands of upvotes from each other. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there ARE people who are "native" to this subreddit who are upset and posting authentically, but I would bet they're outnumbered four to one by the career trolls and karma whores.
---
How about, Noooooo
---
Naw. I dont know what gilded means

See my reply to /u/ChunkyDay

Nice... ellipsis... bro... really makes you sound... dark... and foreboding... and cool...
---
I can't figure out how to place the survival camp in adventure mode... üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Why are you like this though?
---
No thank you
---
Huh, I'm sorry did you say something? I was too busy moving on to bigger and better ragefests to poke fun at. Shall we continue there?
---
Then that's your choice. I'm just saying, dont blast it with out giving it a shot.
---
I'm checking it right now. It's not. Even if it was, it should be in the second spot, just as Microsoft themselves mentioned.
---
This page of yours clearly doesn't represent what you think it does.
---
Good talk, brother! ‚úåüòé
---
Then releasing a private server alternative where everything works better before ensuring stability for everyone is a just dick move. "We will fix it, promise, but in the meantime, you can pay extra and play the fixed premium version".
---
Bethesda said it was a display issue originally but later they changed that statement and said it's more than that for "a very small percentage"
---
Tuba is a wind instrument, so it should work
---
Interesting and to be expected but how big is the blocked zone? Is is the same as regular CAMP?
---
I think the misunderstanding is people thought private servers would be a fix to the lack of world persistence, because in every other multiplayer survival game in existence, a private server is persistent.
---
There we go... there's always at least one.  Honestly I was expecting a "And how does Todd's dick taste?" to pop up first.
---
Bow down to my superior scrap inventory peasant üòú
---
Hey, if it looks like a pinko, marches like a pinko, and wants the same thing for everyone like a pinko...
---
Good to hear, I was hesitating to leave initial area until I finished exploring.
---
Same way as in private, open the favorites wheel, look at the bottom of the screen and push the button that it tells you to deploy the camp.
---
I don‚Äôt disagree, i just was over hearing about all the literally unplayable nonsense i just want to play with people lol.
---
Understandable ‚úå
---
Are you kidding? This sub spends half of its time complaining about the game and the other half demanding they change one thing or another to suit the poster's personal playstyle. Fallout 1st is an horrible bastardization of what people expect from a private server, but most people are using it to bring up old complaints or riding the hate train for karma. It's scummy and insanely overpriced but it's not new content and being able to horde more junk isn't an advantage.
---
I think there is a sub where you can't be negative or something. I think it is r/fo76FilthyCasuals.
---
I love 76 also ya I get lonely running around alone some days I have it on pc and just got it for xbox one ya there are bugs some are funny like seeing a mole rat running around with no feet . I have played on pc from the bata also I am not going to play on the new servers even if they was free I like to see other some times we can gripe all day long but in the end it won't matter to them we still play and some still pay hope to see you all some day been I started all over for the 3rd time dont get mad just laff at it and see what happens  next
---
all good man!
---
I just wish to play it offline an explore the world!
---
That's fine! I do wish you would give it a shot but I can understand why you wouldnt want to.
---
A single photon.
---
My evasive perk procs immediately, all signs of latency are practically gone. Shooting heads feels instantaneous. Like... There are clearly massive server issues with this game, and being alone in one makes it obvious. It's no wonder the developers likely didn't anticipate the hot mess it'd be on release, since the servers they played on in house were likely buttery smooth. A lot of the glitches seem to be directly related to latency issues. Think about it. Microsecond delays in actions such as exiting power armor are usually the things that feel detached or glitchy.
---
TL;DR: there needs to be a massive focus on server optimization in Adventure mode. The difference between private and Adventure makes it apparent.
---
He hasn't been here since launch has he
---
Probably because the 1k guys that are left playing are the die hard Bethesda fans that will pay for anything. 
---
Can I sell you a horse armor?
---
I‚Äôm already trying and liking it. Have almost 1600 hours in game.
---
I love the way the main appeal of private sessions is to limit the amount of contact you have with other people in this multiplayer game.
---
I meant in the billing sense because in some way or another, you paid some form of currency to get the game therefore you are paying customer because you have bought the game, unlike people who pirated it  (though with 76, that isn't possible but the concept is still the same).
---
Seems like this is the best time to uninstall I'll get outer worlds.  I've already wasted too much time on it, better late than never.  I hope all their servers dry up after this stupid business decision.
---
As already stated, I have not interest in arguing with your kind. Welcome to my block list.
---
Appliances
---
Indeed! And the first ones who paid the price without any thanx or bugfixing was the betatesters who paid full price...
---
Karma farm failed. Go on to the next sub.
---
That's fair enough I suppose. I won't say Bethesda has been 100% innocent, because that's just false. They definitely could have explained things more clearly to prevent these misunderstandings from happening in the first place, especially considering how unconventional this game is compared to its contemporaries.
---
I bought a survival game, I want the survival mechanics that include the other players.
---
&gt; deal with randos ruining your personal experience 
---
I have never met 1 random player who has ruined anything for me. Since I started playing on PS4 48 hours ago (which is already being refunded) I haven't seen 1 player.
---
&gt; won't be disappointed 
---
Everything about this game has been a dissapointment from the start for the largest majority of any playerbase that has existed in any gaming community anywhere.
---
Go away Bethesda.
---
Not to mention it would be useless for farming legendaries unless you wait hours for stuff to redrawn and even worse trying to farm rare spawn vendors.
---
Welp... we totally agree then. Those are my only complaints. I would actually pay for the subscription if they made it fair for everyone. 
---
Lets be honest, private worlds are just used to farm rare materials, nothing else. Its an advantage.
---
Playing solo was promised by todd howard himself and should be made available for everyone also.
---
I already got scammed by Metal Gear Solid V 
---
A Franchise i love dearly. I kept up with news about the game everyday 2 years before release.
---
The lies they spread were insane
---
Im just having PTSD now.
---
Im afraid FO76 goes down the same path.
---
I love 76, really. I looked past every controversy, but this ruined my personal fun. Knowing if i pay, i'd be better.
---
This is the first actual well thought out post I've seen. You have my upvote...
---
You a sore loser, huh? Understandable ‚úå
---
No. I suggest you give me 5 dollars this month. If you like it, you can do it again next month.
---
Because they're charging for what other games have as a basic feature in the standard game, and they lied about stability issues with unlimited stash.
---
If you enjoy playing the game that's completely fine but do you defend bathesda for all their scummy cash grabs?
---
No, I really want to know the odds, since you apparently have access to developer metrics and can totally tell me in a factual manner, and are not just pulling shit out your ass.
---
&gt; ...it‚Äôs all free after launch ‚Äì all our content...
---
Oops, now your point is invalid.
---
It's fine you like the game and want to support it. Don't let other people that feel differently get you down but before launch they made it seem like everything out side of cosmetics would be free
---
Honestly I don't know what you were expecting. It's because of people like you that the "don't ask questions, just consume product" meme exists. People are right to be angry, and they're right to voice their anger.
---
I've asked a couple of my law professors regarding Bethesda's more "notorious" business practices which have occurred for the past year or so. (The pre-order bag scandal, their general disregard for "active consumers" in their community, etc.) They showed an extraordinary amount of interest in the matter, since they couldn't believe such crap had been happening right under their noses! (One of my professors is a father to a son that plays lots of Fortnite, and has in recent months... been asking for "advances" on his allowance, presumably to pay for skins and the like.) Makes for good hypothetical questions for the incoming 1Ls at least, haha.
---
It's pretty much all legal under the current statutes and their overarching figureheads; however, EA has garnered much legal attention in the recent past with their (scummy) microtransactions and I guess, Anthem as a whole. (This is making the judiciary at least "make eye contact" with the problem; so they know it exists, but probably aren't willing to do anything yet.)
---
For now, all of this seems to be compliant to general contract, sales, and DTPA principles: but we're getting closer and closer to some sort of system at least being proposed to "regulate" these practices.  Realistically though, I wouldn't get my hopes up-- so long as Bethesda and EA have the ability to provide a "service" that the public wants and it is at least "facially compliant", it wouldn't matter what we think, they could go through with it.
---
EDIT: spelling hur dur
---
Reset your game. Same thing happened to me when I got the bungalow.
---
Tons of them...
---
It would be hard for the shills to say "ItS nOt CoNtEnT so what's the big deal" at that point.
---
But I don't think they'd do that just yet. Their bottom line will really have to be hurting for them to go back on their word that much.
---
Yeah but just watch at youtube for "SJW owned" or some shit, there are some serious stupid people...even tho bethesda fucked up hard the game launch and now this, some people still defend them...some people have no limit in stupidity, its weird...I don't understand how this is possible.
---
Like I said, it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôm not into league so I don‚Äôt have any reason to browse the community, although I have heard it‚Äôs bad
---
Welcome to the new age... Everyone expects what  they don't deserve
---
Ugh why cant bethesda just make more dlcs for fo4 so my season pass is more worth it smh.
---
Thanks for the text.
---
It probably is. They couldn't have been making much on $15 game sales and atom purchases. I'm surprised the game is still going even on a skeleton crew.
---
Not really the main appeal, more like an added bouns there are people who like playing solo and role playing, and this would boost their ability to do so and still be involved in the events and quest of the game without griefers or others breaking this game play
---
Yes, i imagine they do/did. Same way people are buying Fallout 1st..... that quote is cherry picked and you know it is.
---
Must have said about 3/4 times now that you don't host it on your own network you're essentially paying to do it.
---
If you don't understand what that means don't even reply to me, clearly not intelligent enough to hold a debate.
---
Apparently not.  FalloutSearch was saying it was one of the Ultra Rare outfits... which i guess won't be true once this event comes
---
Mods pre fo4 don't exist on console.  As a result the games more focused on dialog get stale after the first pass.
---
Umm..no. I really did not buy a fridge and I really did buy the subscription
---
Yeah, they took a huge amount of coin for Fallout1, and need to get it working right. ;)
---
But they all knew the truth...a spot in the vault was never guaranteed.
---
yeah, people who play understand how the containers work but I am pretty sure that 80% of this server in the past few days has not touched the game ever or just once during the beta and just bitch and complain to get karma and gold.
---
Where did you get the outer worlds on PC? Did you get it on the epic games store?
---
Then, give everyone a free month subsciption to it. There have been 'free play' weekends, etc...why not a free-play weekend private server to see if you even care about it after you try it. 
---
  I can't see how it's remotely beneficial to me to pay for a second subscription cost on top of an Xbox live subscription. Sure, I'd like unlimited junk and a secondary camp spot...but it's just not worth the extra cost at the end of the day especially after completing the main storyline.
---
You were saying?
---
No I‚Äôm a casual player not a politician explaining my stances on issues
---
I'm very sure that the majority of the posters want the game to be fixed and not delve deep into a scam because they actually loved it and enjoyed at some part
---
It runs way better, think about it the server has 20 less players workload to deal with.
---
If you think 3 vehicles and a house qualifies one as rich, you must still be a child. Once youre an adult having these things becomes normal.
---
Yeah, if you reread my statement you'll find I never said that.  I said Bioware has \*more\* claim to the world's creation than Bethesda because it was their (now-defunct) cousins who started it, their predecessor (Black Isle) who continued it, and their little brother studio who likely did the best modern game.  Whereas Bethesda just came late to the party and bought the IP.  If we're being really picky about wording, I should've clarified this is \*classic\* Bioware, but I thought that was rather implied since modern Bioware has absolutely none of the Bioware people and is just a zombie corpse being puppeted by EA at this point.
---
Because many of the people on the warpath right now aren't players.
---
You are getting a front row seat to how "fake news" works and the mechanisms by which it spreads like wildfire.  The misinformation, the YouTube celebrities, the incessant "Who's with me?!?!" calls to action, and the parrots who repeat everything just for the attention and clicks.
---
You have to understand that for those people, spreading outrage *is* the game.
---
If you are not being paid then just explain why you are telling blatant lies? What other reason is there?
---
You have 48 hours vs my 2300 hours. So I mean I'm not really going to take much from this.
---
Here's your dumb fallout 1st subscriber, please commence and crucify me, here I am.
---
Yes, but I was responding to the comment. It is a good game, but not for his gameplay.
---
You and your kind are the exact reason why they developed this idea and then pushed it. You are the target audience and you make it worth it, you spent money on this piece of shit and you should be ridiculed for it. It's unacceptable, both those who develop scams and those who support scams.
---
This is a pathetic attempt to rationalize your waste of money.
---
Holy fuck cry more... My God...
---
And you think it's acceptable to pass that 100 yearly charge to the consumer? Who also has to in theory pay 60 dollars or 40 GBP 55 Euro at launch? For 8 slots?
---
When it's STILL a buggy mess? Yeah, enjoy being milked.
---
Yeah blaming others for your problems, probably deserve divorce
---
The storage box is pay to win because any scrap you dont have in your storage means more weapons and support items you can have at close hand
---
You still need to do all the work...
---
Todd howard shit in my toilet and didnt flush! Thanks todd!
---
I imagine a lot of them are the kinds of people who don't want to admit their previous fanatical support of Bethesda was a mistake so they're digging their heels in and will carry on the defence of Bethesda to save face and try pretend ['this is fine'.](https://i.imgur.com/HeUNm7E.gif?noredirect)
---
What about the Survival Tent? If Public Servers allow up to 32 players, then imagine 64 player camps placed around the map. You will have to server hop quite a lot.
---
Preston Harvey here, there‚Äôs another workshop to be claimed.
---
Bought a year as well &amp; have no regrets.
---
she left me cause she said I cared about The Todd more then her. I mean just because I have 20 posters of Todd Howard in our bedroom and a shrine of him in my closet and the fact that I ask her to role-play as Todd Howard when we had sex doesn't mean it was unhealthy
---
That's your personal experience and personal opinion and that's fine! But some folks like playing alone. Some like role playing. Some just love playing with their friends and no one else. And they have this opportunity to try it out that way and they should be more than allowed to do so.
---
"Endure server maintenance." Really? Is it that painful?
---
I appreciate it sir, thank you!
---
You might be right to some degree, but I personally uninstalled the game and the launcher last night.  I'm sure there are quite a few others who have turned their back on this game.  I was pretty bummed out about doing it because FO is/was my favorite franchise but there are too many other quality games out there to keep getting strung along by this one.
---
Says the 4 years old account with 21 karma.
---
16 times the detail....
---
I disagree with that being the only reason for private worlds. I think it‚Äôs more the promise of future mod support
---
Todd said game can be played solo. It can. Anyone can play without having to team up. He never promised an empty world where you are the only one.
---
This explains why I couldn't get it to happen, if it's not happening to everyone or not consistently. Maybe they should have lead with the public test server before any other stuff.
---
Mostly constructive criticism compared to virtually every other gaming thing I come across.  There's a huge difference.
---
Reddit isn't the only community though?
---
 Instead of telling us that, it would be nice to warn us of maintenance.
---
You got a base product and continue to receive updates including wastelanders. Sounds like they are holding up their part of the deal. They could go old skool and tell you to live with the issues like back in the day. People really need to realize if there was a bug on older games it didn't get fixed at all unless you went out and bought a newer version of the game. With that in mind what do you feel bethesda owes you still?
---
Yeah you‚Äôre right, you don‚Äôt owe me anything and you sure as shit don‚Äôt need to justify your choices to me...But damn dude, a subscription for fallout76. I just can‚Äôt help but be curious that‚Äôs all.
---
Cosmetic only...
---
I blame your lack of a sense of humor..
---
Really only want the railway? Got mods for that?
---
Warning, Angry Joe being the asshole he has always been.
---
I‚Äôm not gonna take sides without proof.  Big B can blame the player base and the player base can slander Big B.  Is there video proof of dead corpses n shit?  Looted containers doesn‚Äôt mean anything as that‚Äôs just a player not understanding how it works.
---
I'll explain it like you're 5.
---
I bought Fallout 76 on release day on PC. The amount of bugs were absolutely insane but I managed to play for 200 hours.
---
Rebought it 2 days ago on PS4 in preparation for the Wastelanders DLC.
---
I understand you enjoy the game, but you've got to know it's a disgusting, buggy ass mess that's only here to profit from the plebs defending it.
---
Canvas bags
---
Hmmm no.....never coming back to this game. Its over for me and i'am done with bethesda. I feel 100% betrayed. They got enough of my money. Bye bye And you keeping supporting this is, is telling them that its ok for Company to f**ked us with shitty,unfinished,unpolisehd,buggy game like this one....the last update is a shyt hole.
---
Paying for one of these memberships in and of itself is a problem. How did people not expect this to happen? Why do people keep giving Bethesda more money even after all of these well-documented fuck ups? Because they're going to keep doing this so long as people keep paying them.
---
Anyone coming across vast amounts of mines/tomahawks laying around the grounds of vendors?
---
They are not activated, nor in bags. Like hundreds of plasma mines stacked on the ground?
---
You've shown it pretty clearly there that these two things are not really on equal footing. There is legitimate harm coming to people in China, there is legitimate governmental divide happening in Hong Kong, there is an actual provable PROBLEM being demonstrated against.
---
And then there's people that are angry that Bethesda rolled out a subscription service for their MMO-ish game, which everyone saw coming eventually, isn't mandatory, and cannot even begin to be compared to the situation in China.
---
One group is protesting, the other is assmad at a video game. That's how I see it, anyway.
---
Todd Howard once came to my house and punched my puppy in the face! Thanks Todd!
---
Uhhhhh... I don't work for Bethesda.
---
Who says they charge for bug fixes? Only you. You're dumb.
---
It's true. You should look into it. Corporations do it all the time. When they release something they tend to create a feeling of exclusiveness or similar to encourage buying. 
---
What BSG did here was not only encourage but also force buying by including 2 of the most requested features into the subscription. They do not only create a feeling of exclusiveness (with all the "premium" and "1st player" stuff it's more than obvious) but also a feeling of need based on what the playerbase has requested.
---
(PC, Public, Adventure mode, not 1st member)
---
Just recently I noticed at Relay Tower LW-B1-22 that Rover can be fixed after enemies constantly attack, but near the completion of his task, will simply hover around the entire relay tower site instead of proceeding to the last stages of the event - entering his pod. It makes it impossible to complete the event and the timer will simply run out. Presumably this is because Rover had the repair sparks effect persist on his model even after being repaired already. May be timing related when he is repaired and immediately knocked out again requiring repairs, and his dialogue shows that.
---
Also, is the months-old bug where the game can potentially lockup/freeze screen while using any aid item while audio continues to play on this list at all? Even can happen with using stimpaks with the H key shortcut. That bug is *so* annoying.
---
This ladies and gents is a man in delusion. This is why we can't have nice things. Honestly, I feel sorry for you.
---
That's would be an interesting idea and it would be cool if Bethesda went with an idea similar to that, it would probably convince more folks to actually get the Subscription.
---
Lol for real? Man grasping at anything. This is the reason you use condoms folks.
---
I logged in. Tried to do dailies. Two-out-of-three dailies were bugged and didn't register completion (Cop a squatter and Heart of the enemy), and I logged out.
---
"Fraud" as a cause of action has got a high threshold of evidentiary necessity required for an individual to pursue it against an entity. I don't think Bethesda's conduct even scratches the surface on a legal basis.
---
Courts are aware of "scummy" tactics used by businesses to do the one thing, they're meant to do: make money. 
---
"Working as intended" as you all around here say. :{
---
finding out the different viewpoints. I am a huge Bethesda fan and a lot of people are angry, really angry and they have never even played fallout 76. So i want to see the different opinions of different people.
---
Don't you guys see this game as a cash grab? I would love to hear what you have to think.
---
I played a lot of different games. even mobile games riddled in micro transactions. I know these kind of games are cash grabs. And i am fine with it.
---
In my opinion Bethesda should really make this game free to play at this point. People can pay if they want. They have the micro transactions to support it. Maybe they can give the people who bought it special rewards or something. So that they at least can reward the loyal fans who bought it at launch.
---
Funny enough it happened and now I regret not taking photos.  Next time,  I will.
---
X-01 with T-60 legs for cheaper repair costs with still good values of repair costs is an issue. 
---
Not sure if Ultracite parts are a benefit in that configuration.
---
I think it should be akin to power amor. You place it down, use it real quick, and then it goes back in your inventory. Or just give it a much smaller area so it doesn‚Äôt interfere with camps. But there‚Äôs tons of Appalachia to place a camp. The problem is that everyone chooses the same spots to place their camp.
---
Thank you u/SPAZZ70 for this post, we may be the minority on this sub but I feel the same way you do. 
---
To those who claim this is P2W: what exactly am I winning by being able to store junk? Especially in a community of players who more often not, help each other. Countless players drop junk and other items for low levels all the time. This is a cooperative game more than PVP. I see it as a opportunity to team up and help each other when another player might not have the materials they need. And what exactly is winning in this game anyway? If I don‚Äôt PVP, what did I win? 
---
On the Pete Hines, ‚Äúall DLC will be free‚Äù comments: what is your definition of DLC? Keeping this in terms of Fallout, I purchased the season pass for 4 and got 2 new worlds, workshop items and side quests. Did we on 1st receive any of that? Besides an outfit and a scrapbox? How do you consider that actual DLC?
---
The key point of this questions is "we didnt pay"
---
Yes, you have to endure server maintenance to fix issues the people pay for support  have.  
---
If you paid for support, your opinions may hold more weight with the controling entity.  Shareholders dont bow to nonpaying customers, they support the people that pay them.
---
Um I've played since beta and havent stopped. It's not a disgusting buggy mess for me and I'm sorry you feel that way. But I'm not going to agree to anything you said because I'm not looking to insult others in this game for how they wish to play.
---
There is probably a spell checker nearby ... oh forget it. ;)
---
Why the legs in particular?
---
Lol, I was just being a butt. Yes, it's one of the rare jumpsuits that drops from Savage divide region events, I like to wear it a lot to flex my individuality and for the big W on the front pocket, but guess I'll switch to one of the other jumpsuits now. Heaven forbid I show up to events dressed the same as someone else! Man I was gonna sell my extra one for quite a bit too. Oh well. If you don't end up getting it from this event, I'll share my extra with you Sage.
---
Shit posting about how unhappy you are with a game, like everyone else, instead of just not playing the game, is what burns my sense of humor. Seeing these post all day long make it not funny in the slightest. If I truly felt like a game fucked me over id just stop playing instead of going online in hopes of rallying others who feel the same way to circle jerk our feelings away
---

I work for many years in a different branch of a similar industry and I would refuse to tell lies and trick others as my job. My company makes good money while having high quality and the customers get treated good cuz they pay good / or what they pay for. Maybe you gotta grow up and stop defending this bs.
---
There are other game devs and companies that handle this kind of stuff way differently and they make good money too...and dont fuck with their fanbase. maybe ur too young to realise this..
---
Rip ps4 players
---
Yup. Better an honest thousand dollars than a dishonest penny. I'll see you in Star Citizen... in a few years.
---
I grew up with the fallout franchise. I am an actual fan that cares about fallout unlike the people sucking corporate d*** that don't understand how much harm they are causing with their blind support.
---
4 times the size of Fallout 4
---
Not sure if still photos will be enough.  Again, anyone on both sides can make claims, proof might be hard to get but it would be helpful in this accusation game.
---
Meh, I'll get it when I get it lol
---
Jesus, you're such a tool this is sad.
---
Sorry your hard drive is so small? I had plenty of room for both.
---
I'm not going to get milked... because I have no interest in private worlds in the first place and even if I did you would have to be an idiot to want to immediately jump into a service which they have readily admitted is bare bones for now and will get more features later.  Right now they're just offering the service for those people who don't care and just want a private world to play on with their friends.
---
Does no one remember when 76 first got announced and the hard core fans were screaming about how the multiplayer Fallout they always wanted wasn't this faux mmo they gave us but a game where they could just run around on a private world with their friends?  Well Bethesda is delivering that and... people hate it now?
---
Don‚Äôt do it. The weight to scrap ratio isn‚Äôt worth it.
---
"So in the midst of me watching countless game news Youtube channels"
---
 ROTFLMFAO
---
I don't know, why would you want to know such a thing?
---
Then I'll make a video
---
You asked for people's opinions but wont take opinions from players with less than 2,300 hours.
---
Enjoy your 1 opinion.
---
In the last few months on pc I have crashed or had a server disconnect only a couple times. It is pretty rate for me. Also I am not saying I prefer to play alone but playing with a few friends that I have been playing with for years is nice.
---
I‚Äôll get it when the price goes down to 30-40 dollars
---
It just works....
---
I am also a player and I think this game is an actual scam.
---
They didn‚Äôt say players are lying... they said players aren‚Äôt understanding loot mechanics..
---
I said "many."  Not "all."
---
Are there 76 players with legitimate grievances about 1st?  Absolutely.
---
But I don't suspect they are part of the same group that insists on burning the entire house down and cheering for failure, which characterizes the vast majority of the shitposts here in the last 48 hours.
---
Hmm I guess I can see where you're coming from there, I guess for me it doesn't really effect me because I already have a few sets of power armor, a handful of 2 shot explosive weapons and quite a lot of backup aid items that I don't feel like I'm lacking space for them as is.
---
I personally only keep a small amount of junk in my storage and just farm a bit here and there as I need it since I know where to get any junk I'm looking for, I could see how it might have a much larger impact on someone who generally keeps a lot of junk around though, I feel like that is simply because they aren't playing in an effective way in the first place though making something that I view as convenience to become p2w.
---
For myself though I personally only find it as a convenience as I don't believe it would give me any real practical benefit.
---
I agree that everyone should have it, I just don't think it's thats major myself.  
---
Perhaps because I've played games that were incredibly Pay to Win (like Neverwinter) - yes its a F2P game, but if you pay for a subscription you don't suffer injuries in the game.  That would be like if in fallout you never had limb damage because you payed for the service.  That to me is a true edge.
---
OK. They're still not private servers. So what exactly are you paying for?
---
I'll get it next payday lol
---
That's a contradiction. It can't be a good GAME if the GAMEplay isn't acceptable.
---
I have a scope for that. Well two and something else I think
---
No god, no monthly subscriptions please
---
I'm still bummed about survival mode. I didn't quit as a grand protest or anything, I just haven't wanted to play since, even though I miss it. I feel pretty neutral about the fallout 1st situation, maybe I would have tried it out.
---
Why would they not charge for bugfixes? It's a company, not a nonprofit organisation.
---
I too spent $99.99
---
Do I get harassment as well?
---
Sounds like both you and your brother dont understand how business works.
---
You dont get shit for free. Someone pays for it. 
---
Those that pay get better support than freeloaders. 
---
If you want a game to be like minecraft, go play minecraft, which is a steaming pile of garbage.
---
Ridiculously high fee??? By my math its .27 cents a day. I spend more than that on coffee.
---
Dude. Maintenance is always a good thing.
---
So how many other online games offer the same type of subscription? Some of them requiring it just to play the game while also requiring you to buy the dlc. No one is pissed at World of Warcraft, or Final Fantasy 14, or ESO about their subscriptions, so why this one?  There are bugs with it, no one is denying that, but they will be fixed. I think the main reasons why Bethesda is getting so much hate is because of the poor timing, and not telling anyone that there will be a subscription
---
Little lies, stunning shows!
---
I can understand a small fee for hosting a server, but the rest is just scummy. We told Bethesda what would make the game better, and they offered to sell it to.
---
Likewise... Get more space, noob
---
nice
---
Yours is a stretch
---
how exactly is making it less likely to collect scrap not a nerf?
---
Good time to check out Outer Worlds...
---
Yup. Appalachia is a rich, beautiful world that's fun to just explore and play in. Do I wish it had more content and less monetization, sure, but it doesn't interfere with my ability to play in a big giant online sandbox with other Fallout players.
---
Of course, this is a subscription people can/will cancel. They don't fix people don't pay in
---
Can't fire him, he's probably the chairman of the board.
---
Duct tape is only available in loot boxes, they don't have enough microtransaction points to buy one yet.
---
Tbf it shouldnt have exosted in the first place. Its a paid subscription so things SHOULD work if money is at an expense. However im glad those who lost all their scrap will be getting it back, nice to see Bethesda doing something right for once
---
The future is gone not only for FO76, but for Bethesda as a whole. The company is gone. I don't know why your still trying to get through to them. They don't care about us man
---
I never heard them state stuff like this would be free, so I personally was never lied to in any way.
---
So I had just got back from vacation yesterday and hadn't gotten a chance to mess around with the subscription. Besides the glitch where some people are losing scrap (which is why they're down for maintenance right now), I think it's a great deal.   
---
I saw a post about how the "private servers" were fake and loot containers were empty and other things. After using the private world, it's easy to tell that the article is highly inaccurate. The only problem with private worlds is the same problem that fallout 76 had to begin with....people expectations were more than the offering. It seems that most people assumed these would be "offline" persistent worlds (akin to ARK) and while that would be wonderful, that is not what is being offered so people are getting upset. I completely understand why they did the private worlds the way they did. It's kinda cool to just go private and be able to take over the workshops in peace and do whatever to build resources before you join back into public (even makes some challenges easier), but it gets very lonely (especially when you run a haunted house). As far as seeing "looted containers", the private world seems to use the exact same real world cool down on items like containers, magazines, and such, which is something already in place to keep people from server hopping to amass the rarer items. And while I believe the world should be able to be made "invite only", some people are stressing that people on your friends list can join....which doesn't really seem like a negative to me. If you're on my friends list I want to play with you.....so feel free to join and team up lol.  
---
That tent is a HUGE bonus as there's been many times I wanted to move to a spot, but didn't want to commit or move my current house (which I had been at for 8 months before moving to construct the haunted house). It doesn't have workbenches but includes practically everything else (stove, sleeping bag, instrument, stash box, junk box) AND functions as another free fast travel point for you (think putting the tent up outside of meatweek, faschnaut, or some other limited time event).  
---
The atoms are a nice boost of currency every month (although I accidentally bought atoms for the halloween bundle and THEN signed up for 1st..smh) and will ensure being able to buy whatever from the Atom shop.  
---
And of course the unlimited component storage is a literal godsend. I dropped over 400 lbs between storage and personal when I unloaded into that thing.
---
TLDR; while this subscription isn't necessary, it is completely worth it (in regards to other similar subscription based online games).
---
If 13 dollars was what broke the camel's back you think they got money for a HDD upgrade
---
I don‚Äôt give a flying f*ck about what someone from Bethesda said before the game launched.  I know realistically that when it comes to budgets, promises and policies are made to be broken.  So when I read executives from Bethesda had said everything outside of cosmetics would be free, I laughed.  Policies change.
---
I was actually surprised this game didn‚Äôt have a subscription or plans for paid DLC from launch, because all of the online games I‚Äôve played did.  I knew something would come, though.
---
So going forward, I will consider each offered feature on its own merit.  
---
Right now, I haven‚Äôt made a decision on the subscription.  I think I‚Äôll wait a couple more weeks while I read more reviews on it.
---
Okay but if you regret it come back here
---
If it's a "steaming pile of garbage", why does it sell so well and have a modding community that's on par with skyrim?
---
Bethesda has a team of marketers and statisticians that show that this move will make them money. They know exactly what they‚Äôre doing. They‚Äôre under a big corporation, they don‚Äôt care about reddit posts. People need to speak with their wallet. Unfortunately the people who buy paid subscriptions and micro-transactions are probably the people who don‚Äôt lurk on this subreddit.
---
Just saying Bethesda doesn‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs all about the numbers
---
I dont feel like Bethesda owes me anything and I do know what it was like to not have glitches and bugs fixed in older games but we were promised that with the base product we bought and received that all non cosmetic content would be accessible to everyone who owns the base content for free. And I know for sure as hell that a scrapbox with infinite scrap capacity and a essentially a forward operating base are non cosmetic items. Sure they added scrap and repair kits but those can be earned in game just by playing and doing challenges which means they're obtainable without having to spend money to get them which means anyone can get them without spending a cent or a penny or whatever currency is prominent in your country.
---
Yeah I almost baited you into realizing how ignorant made up facts are bullshit.
---
Bullet shield is another waste of perks - Blocker is far more worthwhile than either of these 2.
---
50 Cals do take a while to reload too - but in general to me its far better to look for that 15% reload speed 3\* legendary than wasting perks on faster reloads.
---
Yeah what games are you playing?  Best gear in most games that are F2P like FO76 are behind subscription.  I am sure you can play to end game in WoW F2P right?
---
It's not that it swung back.  
---
1.) with the release of the "video game news" on youtube about first, a number of people who don't even play the game (or haven't played the game) came on to stir up trouble (there were quite a few posts form people who said "I don't even play this game")
---
2.)In theory, if people are that upset over it, and spoke their mind yesterday.  There really isn't much more to say.  Logically the upset people left.  So the only people who should be on here are the people for it or neutral to it.
---
Second person to call me Angry joe - I'm not angry joe wtf lol
---
I agree, a tinker bench or chem bench would have been a much more viable option than a cooking pot.
---
Mtx have been around for 15 years.  It's not going to stop here. Petition your government to make policy changes if it's such a bother.
---
What me an idiot no I'm a WINNER cause I have all  content that makes me win like robot that picks junk for me cause it's not like we have any other way of getting junk other than that, I also have a fridge that makes my food spoil slower not like we have perk card for that or anything, also I have all the repair kits so I can not use my hard earned scrap for that, also all this free emotes and outfits that make me look like a WINNER so people know I'm badass so they won't mess with me and if they do oh boy they are going into a world of pain cause I can easily put down my tent and go to my scrapbox and pull out 1000 wendigo teeth's of it and stab the poor sucker in the eye with them...
---
I subbed for a year. The best part? I‚Äôm paying 8.33 a month and people call me a whale! In Vegas, they‚Äôd throw pennies at me and call me a vagrant.
---
Nope.....I know it will be a crap game....worth about 40 hours of game play.
---
Enjoy and see y‚Äôall in a few days.
---
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre getting the point dude. You were saying people were acting entitled but that‚Äôs bullshit. People already paid out the ass for this game. Just ignoring it isn‚Äôt a good answer.
---
I mean maybe you‚Äôre fine paying for all this, that‚Äôs fine, but saying people don‚Äôt have legitimate reasons for being upset is kinda shitty.
---
It‚Äôs important to emphasize that there is a difference between public shaming and harassment. 
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right, these people are asking Bethesda for shitty products and services at the expense of the majority of the player base. It‚Äôs important that they understand that and change their behavior, but since it is ultimately just a video game it isn‚Äôt acceptable harassing folk over.
---
That mentality always confuses me. If you are that upset with a change in the game, then stop playing. I personally don't like the subscription, to me it was a slap in the face, so I uninstalled and will no longer purchase a game from that company unless they get their shit together. That is my view and that doesn't give me the right to mock or attack someone who has a different view than me. If you enjoy the sub and change in direction, then by all means have fun.
---
üò≠üò≠
---
Push your channel harder dude fuck me you posted this 5 times in the past day on multiple subreddits.
---
Except nothing in the atom shop was worth spending money on.  The game isnt going to support itself on cosmetic purchases alone.  They'd need to truly make the atom shop pay to win.
---
Dudette by the way. I know everyone‚Äôs hating on people that are buying the subscription but I‚Äôm not hating on people who don‚Äôt. A lot of people will buy it, even if it‚Äôs only for a month to get the extras. The last few times I‚Äôve played I‚Äôve seen about 50% of the players have it. I probably will only have this month and cancel and maybe buy it again if I want Atoms or when my daughter is off school. I usually spend a lot of money on games as that‚Äôs my chill time but since I‚Äôve bought Fallout I‚Äôve not bought any other game. So I‚Äôve actually save a lot of money this year and the 11.99 was cheaper than buying another game to play with my daughter.
---
because kids like crap games.
---
After you assumed people criticizing the company are full of hate, lmao you just admitted your accounts name is based on pissing people off. I guess my first part of the guess was pretty accurate. Your right I probably shouldn‚Äôt have assumed you lack the milk of human kindness, but giving out some digital items doesn‚Äôt exactly work as evidence for compassion... so I don‚Äôt get that argument.
---
You ignoring their statements doesn't make their statements not exist.
---
Yup. OP doesn't necessarily deserve personal attacks, but I have no sympathy. If you lie with the devil, expect to be treated that way.
---
Ya know, their explanation makes more sense, tbh. Otherwise, wouldn't the servers need to be persistent in order for people to get "old" servers with no one else in them? And if that's the case, then we can get persistent servers, which is epic.
---
P.S. Actually read the statement, not the summary.
---
Your words not mine.
---
I agree. Build the weapons and scrap them again to learn the mods. But for experience, I actually stick to public events and killing things. Especially since they made fast traveling to public events free, even the easy public events give you a few hundred xp as well as whatever rewards.
---
I am not.
---
Why the fuck would they give a shit? They are just milking the community. They already got your money. Take the L and move on.
---
How do you acces your tent. I can‚Äôt seem to find it in the 1st menu or on my character.
---
Look, some of the people making those kinds of posts are just venting their frustration, which is absolutely fine. Others just know that Bethesda keeps an eye on this sub, so they are trying to send them a message. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, either. People have been too lenient on Bethesda for too long, which is why shit like this happens. You should not try to silence criticism just because you have no issues with the game.
---
Yeah, me too! And while I was at it, I uninstalled Fallout Shelter from my phone, just to not be tempted into buying stuff in that game.
---
ah yes the old "anyone who disagrees with me must be from the company" fallacy
---
Wow that was umm... colorful
---
That, I can't figure out why there is nothing to scrap weapons, armor and junk that do not auto scrap at the box... they could put cooking station there but not a single workbench, any one of them will do.
---
"But it's muh money" - said the short-sighted idiot who allows gaming to be ruined for the rest of us
---
See most of you uninstallers back in two weeks, or for Wastelanders.
---
Nobody expected paying for private worlds?  They announced that private worlds would be a purchased feature in last weeks Inside the Vault a week before all of this shit started... and no one batted an eye.
---
This is basically why I subbed for a year. 8 and a half bucks a month gives me 1650. It sets me a budget.
---
Fallout 1st most likely will continue to expand benefits for its members, effectively dividing (and slowly erasing) the playerbase.
---
Does the EU not have laws or representatives for a case where a company advertised a product/service and then charged for additional services after it originally stated it wouldn't?
---
I came here to say the same thing
---
i think he/she is just memeing, at least i think or they got some serious data denial
---
So you're asking for your luxury privilege feature to have more features? On the other hand; you are paying quite a bit for it so it might as well be OP. This situation is not ideal for anyone.
---
Yeah it's called exposure you jackass - not to mention the topic of the video is *relevant* to all the subs I posted smh
---
That's the point of the joke...
---
This post is We-tod-did?!?
---
WARN US OF MAINTENANCE DAMN YOU
---
You're gross. Making a joke abour mental health and linking the website is pretty fucking gross.
---
Look even if you pay for 1 month, you get $16.50 worth of atoms, an outfit and emotes for the price of $13. You can scrounge the wasteland and store massive amounts junk and access it if you don‚Äôt continue your membership (you just can‚Äôt add to it) in addition you can play on private servers for a month. It literally paid for itself in just the atoms you receive. What is everyone‚Äôs issue?
---
While my first impression was the same, I feel like this was intentional.  It's more of a portable rest stop than a second CAMP.  Not having this functionality makes it feel a bit more like you're roughing it in the wilderness.  Besides, you couldn't just add one workbench.  Invariably, one user would want a weapons one.  Another an armor.  Another a tinker.
---
Its called poor management and rushing a product out the door. Many companies do it, doesnt mean people should accept it though.
---
ok chemtrail Jones, but Private World's are just Adventure worlds, with nobody in them
---
Week warning isn't alot of time when you talk about things being promised as far back as 11 months ago.
---
That means it wont come with bugs correct?
---
You're absolutely right. Totally agree.
---
Did they make this statement to their own official forum community before making a statement to Polygon?
---
Let me know when you find it :)
---
I was talking about optional additions, not bug fixes. 
---
You're not able to follow a conversation dumbass.
---
I have yet to experince any world that was recycled.
---
Ha what creature is this and is there some lore?
---
who would want to be related to this burning dumpster fire.
---
&gt; There are these fuckers out there that's never bothered about the game till yesterday
---
And they're really pissed at you for outing them.
---
Even I can see the invisible sarc mark
---
That's not quite how that would work.
---
Company X makes a product: any profit from that product goes towards the next product. Staffing is part of those expenses.
---
But if a product continues to require support, in this case developers, art department, QA and Customer Support, etc. then it continues to require revenue as well.
---
This is pretty basic capitalism: you need money to pay for things that you need to live, until such a time as you figure out a way to be absolutely self-sufficient, or, yuh know, dead.
---
And a lot of developers do fold, because they're games aren't profitable, so the expenses exceed the revenue coming in. It sucks, but it happens.
---
Applies to basically any industry really.
---
This is not to absolve bad business decisions, as they can cause a product to generate more debt than profit, but it is how things work.
---
All things move towards entropy.
---
Disagree with your logic...  
---
1) If a list is hit, and the chance of an item falls inside the "Chance None" range it doesn't go to another list, the engine stops there. 
---
2)The root list is flagged  "Use All" so it can pull from all the lists at the same time.  
---
3) The uncommon and rare items are now more rare, not less, so you don't get more rare items because it's pulling less of the rare items.
---
But your logic was 'they aren't a nonprofit'. So by that logic what is the problem with them charging for bugfixes if they wanted to?
---
I bought it twice. Once on PS3 which I hated because I couldn't get past how ugly it was, and once on PC which I added 100+ mods to and love. :) 
---
For people who get it for 10 different devices though? Yeah... don't get it (unless one is Switch cause then its portable and that's nifty).
---
Lol you paid for that shit? I mean you think its worth it ?
---
That‚Äôs not a reasonable comparison at all. Not even pertinent to the context.
---
A better one would be paying for your daughters college, then being upset when she makes little to no effort to succeed in school. You may not be directly educating her, but you invested in her future at a cost to you. See it‚Äôs a reasonable thing to be upset about.
---
Your the one blaming a video game company for your failed marriage.
---
Agreed. The cooking grill and guitar could go in exchange for a workbench.
---
ya i would have maybe been fine with paid server if it was an actively running server that I could share with my discord group and work together on, like a community game. but no it resets after log out of the owner
---
Well it kinda is to Fallout New Vegas since its a spiritual successor to it. But i agree.
---
Oops, thanks, you'd think after 52 years I would be able to spell.üòä
---
Go ahead
---
Oh I knew it was sarcasm, just want to see something other than shitposts about the game
---
And now the sub gets depressing
---
&gt;The cost of running these servers is negligible at best
---
Nope. AWS is fast but can be pricey. Having a couple of instances running just websites can cost a company 1-2 Thousand a month. Now up the specs to host a full game world and now multiply it by how many servers are active at one time it adds up and is not going to be cheap.
---
&gt; Console players already have to pay for a service subscription just to be able to play the game
---
How is that Bethesda's Fault? You have to pay for power and internet to be able to play as well how is that any different.
---
I think it's fine as it is, and I also think it's a bit intentionally.
---
First (and here's where I put on a tin foil hat) if you can summon your tent anywhere and it has workbenches for armor/weapons - then you can repair your gear practically anywhere.  reduces the need for repair kits (not that I use repair kits and I pretty much know where most benches are anyways) - I don't think this is really the case though,as you can just fast travel back and forth to repair if you wanted to. 
---
But I think it's also intended to be more of a "buff hub" - you get your rest,  you get your music buff, and you craft some food for buffs and to replenish your bars and go exploring, I don't think it's meant to be a full fledged camp.  
---
By the by, does anyone know if non subscribers can use things like the cooking pot?
---
Actually no they said private world are working as intended and they will add privacy settings in a future update
---
Ok ok so heres my 2 cents on all of this...i have been a big fan of fallout ever since i discovered it back in new vegas days. Fucking LOVE this game, diehard fan tbh. However, since release of fo76 i have tried to keep a positive thought on this game, have been able to up until they announced private servers. Do they not realize that people still farm for items and sell them for real cash??? A private server not only helps allow that, but also helps out the duplicators, since now no one will be keen to see them in action to report. Smh, i had such hight hopes bethesda, that yall wouldnt do this sort of death defying stunt, but here we are. In my most sincere voice, i do hope and pray you find your way through all of this garbage thats flying our way, and come up with real and decent updates to this game. I still LOVE fallout and all it has to offer besides the monthly pay for private. So please, for the love of atom, listen to us!
---
You not deserve to be abused.
---
Many like all the in game cosmetic stuff.And will pay for it.
---
Bethesda wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't lucrative.
---
Some on Reddit can not seem to grasp the "Supply and demand " concept
---
Does not mean i support it,because i personally do not.
---
I accept  the future of gaming on all formats will be evolving around in game micro transactions.Reason being  revenue for games developer is much greater than that of content add ons.
---
I will be calling it a day real soon.
---
Wait, you have a private server now, hide there.
---
Yes, I also thought of that. Maybe my 2nd idea would actually be better. A Scrapbox that can scrap weapons/armor too.
---
Kinda the other way around.  A different breed of toxic players: the ones that couldn't rationally discuss problems with the game, left to form that subreddit.  To them, there was no difference between "basement dwelling youtube hatemonger smearing shit against the walls" and "person legitimately upset over the latest Bethesda fuckup/nerfest patch/general state the game shipped in." ANYTHING negative about the game was TOXIC from people CHOOSING to HATE this WONDERFUL GAME.
---
THey are still toxic, it's just a different flavor of poison... but I wouldn't call them positive or this place negative. The main fallout reddit... yeah that got pretty toxic pretty quickly. But when this forum began to realize the shit was stinking, the *filthy ones* said that stench was roses and left to go bathe in it. But even then, this sub never reached the toxic levels of hate from the main sub, and was more "someone hurt and venting" as opposed to "FUCK EVERYONE THAT SUPPORTS THIS GAME YOU STUPID TRAITORS TO GAME-DOM" 
---
Still though, this sub stays pretty positive outside the times Beth is taking it's next steaming dump on the player base.
---
\&gt;29/32 posts on the reddit are complaining
---
\&gt;holy fuck cry more
---
A round of applause for the people defending this shit.
---
I agree. I guess they didn't like the numbers. Probably way too less atom purchases than previously thought. The whole handling of Fo76 just screams to get the numbers right. They want Fortnite money, but just can't even understand how they cannot get that with how everything has been done.
---
Dude, that's a fair point. You don't know what you don't know.
---
Everything that's happening here is nothing. Yeah, there's a lot of negativity. Some of it is just over the top and mean-spirited, sure, agreed. They are the vast minority though.
---
There are legitimate criticisms made by genuine fans who would love nothing more to sing the praises of this game and of the devs (yes, even the quitters!) but unlike a lot of people on one of the other subs, they're not going to do so blindly.
---
Bethesda very much deserves the criticism they're getting. It wasn't due to some impotent incels lashing out at the world for inadequacies in their own lives. Bethesda earned this criticism and general negativity themselves. It's not toxic, it's (mostly) fair.
---
thats Albert Einstein's definition of insanity not the official definition of insanity.
---
I think I laughed at that way harder than I should of done.
---
I pay for enjoyment and have not been let down. Maybe you are looking too deeply at this.
---
Did everyone clap at the end?
---
So? Lol
---
I'm not blaming the devs, they probably wanted to make something better but were told to take Fallout 4 assets, give them some polish, make a backstory then sell it as a multiplayer mode
---
That is actually never going to happen. Anyone who thought somehow they would be given the game and allowed to mod it like a singlepayer game clearly just had fingers in thier ears.
---
Legitimately not one person ever thought they would be hosting a server.
---
Nah I‚Äôm sick of you complaining about nothing.
---
I think the subscription plan is garbage.  BUT, it still doesn't mean people get to decide what others do with their money.  Sending them harassing messages makes them a POS.  The message is a private one so it's not even social shaming to get them to change their ways.  It's just a private targeted bit of hate.  GTFO of here with that BS.
---
&gt; Except nothing in the atom shop was worth spending money on.
---
Who's fault is that?
---
&gt; The game isnt going to support itself on cosmetic purchases alone.
---
Plenty of other games do. Why can't they? ALl they have to do is put the tiniest bit of effort in. But they can't even release a patch without breaking the majority of the game. 
---
See, this is what I'm talking about. Even with everything they've done wrong treating you guys like trash, you still go crawling back. I don't get it.
---
None of my teammates ever want to run them. 
---
Me and my girlfriend tried once and got disconnected and we never did it again. 
---
Add me. Psn tigersmhs07 because I really really wanna do it
---
You know when, you server hop, and boxes you just looted are still empty? its the same thing, not recycled worlds
---
keep in mind to make it a proof you will need to record at least 5 minute on adventure server before jumping on your private server and open friend list as soon as you join to proof none of your friends is doing all the killing and looting ;).
---
And you're one of the ones who clearly cant understand sarcasm.
---
Omg lol interpretation is everything genius.
---
well, they did say persistence is in the future... but on the flip side, if the loot didn't reset at some point what would the server look like, and how would events be applied, etc.  There has to be some amount sort of reset.
---
wow really where do i sign up?
---
&gt; I have over 4k atoms sitting there because there just isn't anything in the shop that I want.
---
Peanuts.  I have 10K.  (That's after having spent about 3K on fun stuff when the collectron came out).  Never bought a single atom.
---
&gt; There are bugs with it, no one is denying that, but they will be fixed.
---
Unbelievable.
---
Than unsubscribe, it use to be til everyone started hating on this update
---
If anyone had cared at the time about private worlds being a purchased feature then this sub would have blown up as always about how Betehsda was once again squeezing players for every cent... but nothing happened... for almost a full week.  Not until the rest of this popped up and people needed more things to complain about and THEN paying for private worlds became an issue.
---
Noted
---
I'm pretty sure the placed TENT just exists in the world for anyone else to use.  I've read about players setting them up at SBQ battles.
---
Has anyone datamined the drop-rate chance? I would be curious to see the chances to receive each reward.
---
Like a scarlet letter.  Or in other words people being shitty and justifying it.
---
Clearly not true as they have fixed serious issues in the past quickly via hot fixes.
---
Normally I've seen that when something is either directly incompatible or missing, if you double checked the 2 lines I mentioned above are not in the copied INI's, not sure.
---
You are mislead if you think there is a such a thing as "fake news". This term was coined by Trump to discredit real news he didn't like. Moreover, there is a difference between reddit posters and youtube "content providers." Some of the latter are not averse to spreading lies and rumors because there is profit to be made on youtube. Here on reddit, there is no profit to be made by posting. I'll bet that over 99% of the people complaining here on this subreddit are true FO76 players. They are not here to spread outrage, but to voice their genuine feelings. They are pissed off and don't want others to subscribe to Fallout 1st. That doesn't give those people who harassed the OP the right to do so, however.
---
How is people charging caps for it a bad thing though? That creates a system where people are able to receive some of the "premium" benefits without paying for a subscription. That's generally considered a good thing. Nowhere near as good as warframe, sure, but it's a small positive. Caps are worthless in the endgame anyway, you get them far faster than you can spend them
---
I'm still on the "try not to accidentally nuke own base"-level.
---
They have been when serious issues pop up. Depends on the issue severity and complexity
---
I got it for free from a friend and I'm still mad, because I know he wasted his money, I put in more hours than him ironically, he didn't even make it to the Free states bunkers.
---
Ok, boomer
---
And will you come to grips with the concept that you are voting with that money, and you are voting in favor of more bullshit subscription and scams? They see your purchase and see it as you saying, "give me more of this."
---
I've saved up all my steel &amp; nuclear material to build my own personal missile silo so I can freely nuke any player that I feel like, destroy their camp &amp; steal even more junk!
---
how about....no maybe you can just ignore me and stop getting sand in your vagina
---
I was trying to replicate recycled server issue when i heard about it and i couldn't, otherwise i will post it on my little YouTube channel :)
---
Why do people need to be compensated lol. They are being made whole
---
Todd Howard shot my cat and stole my brother at 4:39am this morning. Why Todd, why?
---
I feel like Elder Scrolls 6 will make or break the legacy of this company for the next decade or so.
---
bye.jpg
---
well ya good point, but I think items and events reset after a while if no one is in the area.
---
You're 100% right but please understand that the way you spend your money affects the world around you. If enough folks purchase the subscription to make it a viable business, then it will become the de facto standard.
---
Once upon a time we didn't have microtransactions and I think we would all agree it was nice and overall better then. However people keep paying for MTX, and we keep getting more of them.
---
So yes, you can spend your money however you want, but as a person that must coexist with you in the same society, within the same gaming realms, it is within my right to try to change your mind in a friendly constructive manner. People buying this sub are actively making the gaming industry worse in my eyes, you're free to do it, but I'm free to (nicely) raise my concerns with it.
---
Well like i said i haven't played the game for 3 months, i don't look at the vault news. Literally been waiting for wastelanders update. But then i seen the articles an came here an checked their website to see what the fuss was about and now here i am, voicing discontent. As is my consumer right, providing feedback...
---
Nice. Great job at missing the point. I mean, just *look* at how far off you are. It's incredible.
---
I don't care. I got my Ranger Armour to piss off all the people like you. ;) It was really the Reddit howls of rage that made me do it.
---
I‚Äôm rubber and you‚Äôre glue.
---
While I don't deny there are probably some people who say they were mad that end up geting the service, I think you seem to be missing that there were two sides and the only one speaking today is the one that was for it - since the ones against (if they were rational) left and didn't come back.
---
Yeah but way less. You also bring up a great argument against playing the game in the first place. Its WORK after you beat the main quest.
---
Wait, I'm supposed to be getting paid?
---
Is this gonna be like when George Soros paid me to support Hillary, because I'm still waiting on my Soros Bux...
---
The fallout first?
---
HA! That‚Äôs just what Angry Joe would say. üòâ
---
Yes, I understand the details and why. It's a single-player game that uses hacked on multiplayer (and requires it) to try to be a substitute for content that doesn't even run multiplayer well. 
---
But I feel like you're missing the absurd situation where players who never wanted to play online in the first place must now pay for a gaming service that is designed to let people play games online with other players, and another gaming service to allow them to play by themselves without other players.
---
Can you name any other game that requires a subscription to play single-player?
---
Is that you, Todd?
---
That‚Äôs what she said.
---
Beacon of positivity?
---
Are you illiterate or just enjoy speaking in hyperbole?
---
If you just bought it, restart the game it should appear under appliances. The cool part is that you can build the Halloween and mothman fog machines
---
"Who's fault is that?"
---
The player base for being so toxic against the idea of utility items.
---
What online game with an average player age greater than 14 survives on cosmetics alone?
---
Adults aren't going to spend their hard earned money on cosmetic purchases.
---
As for treating us like trash, IMO, they arent.  They gave us a product we wanted in exchange for money.  That's treating us like customers in a capitalist society.  If you dont like it maybe try socialism on for size?
---
That's obviously contextual. If you release a story-driven game that focuses on telling a story and on rich lore then gameplay takes the backseat. FO76 is not one of those games. It's gameplay-driven and has bad gameplay. This is not an opinion but a fact.
---
no unfortunately my family dose not have arms
---
No one should be harassed but saying that only the company is to blame is false. The only reason they continue this shit practice is because people like you support it and pay them money. Players like you and companies are guilty.
---
I don't see no difference there. Your emphasis is on you paying for her education at some point in her life and my emphasis is on you abandoning her for a decade. You are not paying attention on that abandon part. Sure, you still can have a say if your face is thick enough but you must acknowledge that your word would have little to no weight when compared with your wife's and you shouldn't be upset about that
---
An option displayed when favorites dialog is showing
---
Are any of these adequate?
---
Have it come to your mind that MAYBE they all have valid reasons to be so pissed at Bethesda?
---
I just mean they should get their junk back.
---
Nice one, that's a frequent comment as well. Except, it's better when it's actually accurate.
---
Ok.
---
I too was very skeptical. Either way you feel, it was still promised and used as a selling point. That's upsetting to a lot of people who believed them. 
---
I'll say the junk box is crazy useful and the private worlds I have been on were lag free. Like 0 lag. It's bonkers the difference it makes
---
6 hours later and it's on the front page. Hmmmmmm.........................................................................................
---
Done!
---
it's on your favorites wheel for pc or more precisely it's a T for tent placement directly under the favorites wheel .
---
I just want it to be free
---
The scrapbox isn't a small issue. Ammo is made up of junk. Storing infinite junk effectively means storing infinite ammo. A few lucky hole runs and a bit of smelting and you can have enough weighless lead for years of gameplay. You can leave the junk in your stash and magically craft ammo into your inventory any tinker bench. That's very powerful, and greatly reduces the need for rifleman/commandos to run bandoleer 2. 
---
The larger issue is that it split the community. Most of the players I know personally won't keep playing as second-class players. It doesn't mater if their stash is the same size. They were told the stash restriction was for stability, or for a survival feel, but neither of those justifications holds.
---
Imagine having a take this bad. That's beyond ignorance. That's why people call it stupidity-tax now.
---
Not just servers, but already existing worlds that may have been looted already.
---
I bought a year subscription because of all the salty karma whores on Reddit. I have to say, I am NOT disappointed
---
Haven‚Äôt run into the issues other people claim to have. I‚Äôm starting to suspect that many on this sub are just cancerous people who love nothing more than to try and tear things down because they aren‚Äôt happy in their lives.
---
I‚Äôve seen this happen when they‚Äôve changed ANYTHING about the game.
---
I suspect these are the guys that grief people in other online games and are pissed that this gives players the ability to completely eliminate the threat of someone running through your camp with a horde of super mutants in tow. 
---
They‚Äôre angry that the world isn‚Äôt given to them in a platter and want to destroy other people‚Äôs fun because misery loves company.
---
See now, isn't it annoying when someone bitches?
---
Down votes are mainly because people are posting about the same issue every minute flooding this forum for others that want to have discussion about anything else really.
---
Exactly this, by paying for it you basically agree with what they‚Äôre doing. I don‚Äôt understand how some people say ‚ÄúI paid for it because I like the game, but I don‚Äôt agree with what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù
---
Boomerism is a mindset.
---
Here's an explanation for those who don't understand why people keep spending their money on this game... It's actually pretty damn good. I completely understand the vitriol too however, because the game also totally sucks. It's honestly the best, worst game I've ever played. Despite the constant server crashes, game-breaking bugs, lack of human NPCs, minimal story, ridiculous Atomic Shop prices for cosmetic items (most of which should have clearly been put in the game and acquired through quests in the first place), Atomic Shop items that are dangerously close to "pay to win", and the only big thing to look forward to (Wastelanders) being pushed back until Q1 2020, I still can't stop playing. The world is simply gorgeous, the camp building is satisfying (though still quite flawed), the community is great (for the most part), and there is no shortage of the Fallout "charm" seen in single player entries in the series. I am, by no means, defending Bethesda's continuous abuse of their fans (c'mon, at least give away some Atoms for free once in awhile!), but I'm also probably not going to stop playing 76 any time soon. Call me a glutton for punishment I guess.
---
Completely disagree. If players didn‚Äôt want to play online... don‚Äôt buy an online multiplayer spinoff it‚Äôs that simple. Play fallout 4. Imagine complaining about world of Warcraft being online.
---
I play solo all the time without a subscription...
---
Look at his name man. Only way to beat these people is to not engage and let them be unnoticed.
---
It is a cool looking game. Not my cup of tea, but I'm sure many will enjoy it.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for these to stop, holy shit
---
Whenever I see someone with the NCR Ranger costume in game I immediately run up to them and give them a Thumbs Down emote.

EMBRACE SUBSCRIPTIONS OR YOU\*WILL\*BE\*DESTROYED
---
This sub is not representative of the main playerbase. 
---
Most of the vitriol you have seen over the last few days are not from fallout players.  Most of it comes from youtube groupies who are only looking to cause division and strife to bolster their youtube channel views, or gain post karma by trolling, copy/pasting the same posts in other subreddits and forums.   The other side of the coin are players who quit months ago and are still butthurt so they come to try to get others to join the trash bethesda bandwagon. 
---
The vocal minority here is not representative of the main playerbase, it represents the anger of people who cannot vent anywhere else because they would be banned.   Some of them have already been banned from this one. 
---
The vocal uprising of the internet trolls will not sway bethesda at all.  They understand that people are actually happy about this, and the money they made 2 days ago proves it.
---
The scrap container from the fallout membership isn't a stash expansion 
---
And besides they did that because scrap is easier to go unlimited on scrap because it doesn't have to render much when viewing it there are no mods and small models so it doesn't add alot of strain on the server
---
***So I did what I never thought I'd do...I UNINSTALLED***
---
Yep, that's clearly someone who thought they were getting married to Todd.
---
Am I supposed to read into that and understand this is really someone engaging in hyperbole for the sake of drama? That's incredible.
---
That's good. Thanks for the info.
---
Actually, I'm sorry, I think I'm to blame. I also wrote to Howard asking for a sub but I was just hoping to have some kinky fun in Appalachia. I guess I should've been more specific.
---
I just don't see the point in attacking another player over this. I'm immensely disappointed in Bethesda for this move, but if someone feels that the subscription is worth it, whatever. I may think they're making a bad decision and even enabling Bethesda's poor decision, but personal grievances  don't justify harassment and severe ridicule. Maybe if this was over a more important issue, I'd feel compelled to criticize, but it's a game subscription. People supporting Fallout 1st doesn't actively make people's lives worse or hurt me in any meaningful way (worst case scenario is the game gets worse and I drop 76, which at this point isn't much of a sacrifice imo), so I'm fine with people buying in if they genuinely think it's worth it.
---
You do you, OP.
---
YOU'RE* People still can't get this right.
---
I can see the problem with it (unlimited scrap is a bit much) but what i dont get is this sounds exactly like Elder Scrolls Online's Subscription and no one was talking or hating on that when it came out. You still have to buy Expansions with ESO as well (unless I'm missing how exactly that works).
---
A legit concern and a good solution to said concern.  Been a few days since this sub had this.
---
I'm not sure exactly how it works.  
---
I do know that (at least previously) you could exploit the mob spawns by having one person in the world and then someone else leave and reenter.  That's how my friend and I grinded to 80 in one day at whitespring. After the bomb dissipated we'd keep leaving and comping back and the glowing ones would spawn but the radiation was gone.  
---
But only mobs spawn. If I collect the golf outfits from the whitesprings - they won't appear for me until so much time has passed, but my friend will see them. So it's like to a certain extent loot is tied to character in what appears (which also makes some sense in that if I kill a mob, physics may kick it one way for me and another way for my friend). 
---
But again, I'm not exactly sure how it works.
---
You‚Äôre actually an asshole. Get a life...seriously if there‚Äôs any way to prove your point it‚Äôs to use a spongebob meme at the end of it
---
The multiplayer mode is shit.  Base building is not so hot either.
---
Oh and you'll have to pay for new content.
---
I would like to try again, please add me gfg6179
---
It‚Äôs a super power I have.......some call it a curse.
---
Its not your fault these angry fanchildren dont have 8 or 13 bucks, or somehow feel morally obligated to not spend money on something they enjoy.
---
One. 100% of Fallout First money is going to equity? Can you source that? Or is it simply speculation? 
---
Second, BGS has had a history of questionable paid content all the way back to horse armour. 
---
But also Fallout shelter.... Is a beast for microtransactions.... If say the shift started more in earnest back with its creation
---
It is weird that Obsidian didn't include a way to remap the controls from the start. Hopefully they add that for people. But still, day 1 and all that.
---
It‚Äôs definitely worth it for me. I‚Äôm a solo player and having my own private server is like an offline solo fallout game
---
Ok thanks, do they sell at all or should I just give them away
---
I prefer lemon.  ;)
---
Yup Im going to hoard junk at you til I win the PvP i never engage in in the first place
---
If mental gymnastics were an Olympic event, you'd be gold medal material
---
You're right. Everyone on this sub seems to be either brainwashed or brain dead. No signs of intelligent life here. All those defending this shit have to have some kind of Stockholm Syndrome.
---
Stop shilling you dick.
---
I like this post because it calls out all the current top posts in the sub, I mean yes, i bought fallout 1st, but that doesn't mean I'm a bad person or that anyone should try to guilt me for spending *my* money how I'd like to
---
If mental gymnastics were an Olympic even, you'd be gold medal material
---
Is the head the same place as the rest that sounds super cool to get
---
is that what is going on!? i just tried to hop on and i had to log in and then it said i didnt have the right requirements. i thought i got banned or something
---
Serves you all right for supporting trash because you liked the name. Enjoy.
---
I think it would help as well, I agree. And with the way the srapbox works if you lapse for a month it's not a big deal. I'm sure plenty of people would be happy to spend 500 atoms, fill the sucker up, then let it lapse until space was an issue again and they were low on room. 
---
I think the tent could also be added as quest line for the scouts.  As it is, I'd be happy to buy some skins or alternate versions fo the tent.  I'd love nothing more than a true pop up camper as my tent.
---
Filthy Casuals is a shithole.  That sub moderates almost any comments that could be controversial into oblivion. 
---
If you are a snowflake and like puppies and cupcakes, FC may be for you.  But if you have a different view, they ban you.

Almost certain ya gotta buy the whole set

If I did business with my customers like Bethesda has done with Fallout 76 (love it as I do) I would be destroyed in a week

Server tech and hosting an online game like FO76 isn‚Äôt really like that anymore dude. FO76 does their ‚Äúworlds‚Äù similar to the way WoW does things with hosting only a handful of servers and stacking multiple instances on top of each other.
---
If it was really this great expense free-to-play multiplayer games wouldn‚Äôt even be a thing.
---
This is a thin excuse and it just doesn‚Äôt work.
---
You do, and so do console players, and then they have to pay a sub to play the game, which then asks them to pay another sub for basic features that should be in the base game after stating they wouldn‚Äôt do this.
---
All of the survival worlds died in 2019 due to Todd Howard killing them and replacing them with private worlds that don't have any loot. The private worlds work for the bourgeoisie.
---
Beat me to it
---
2007 huh?
---
You do realise that the practice of dodgy monetisation from Bethesda started in 2006 with the release of Oblivion's horse armor DLC?
---
Here's a theory for you (with about as much credibility as the Luke Stephens piece) - Bethesda almost went bankrupt with Morrowind and hated the feeling of being nearly bankrupted that they turned to other revenue sources to avoid this situation starting with their first game after Morrowind, Oblivion.
---
Maybe this whole cash grab thing from Bethesda isn't a Providence investment thing afterall...
---
:) yes!  I rarely post
---
Nah, they're never going to fix the damage bug. They made it harder to trigger way back in January and then stayed completely silent about it, pretending it no longer existed despite countless videos and support tickets proving otherwise. Raids brought it back to launch levels and idk if they ever ended up fixing it. Haven't played since then, but from what I've heard it's still not fixed
---
720 hours per month
---
1 Hour is .0013888888888889% of your subscription time
---
.0013888888888889% x 13$ subscription = .0180555555555556$
---
They owe you 1.8 pennys per hour.
---
It's an online game only so that they hacked on multiplayer (poorly and limited) to an existing single-player game engine to excuse their lack of content and maybe give a crude social aspect to incentive selling overpriced cosmetics.
---
As a multiplayer experience, it's piss poor... which makes it even more insulting to have to pay to get away from that.
---
DPS is not the only type of "power". Some people are traders. Some people are collectors. All of these are endgame goals.
---
I don't know how to fly a helicopter but if I see one in a tree I know someone fucked up
---
I did as well. I tried to defend it, believing it would get better but it won't. It just keeps getting worse and I'm done after this latest fiasco.
---
r/whoosh
---
he was already 15 cores into it and he was at 50% lol tough battle
---
You're a good guy, don't let anyone put you down for buying something you wanted
---
Yes, the sub is good for YOU. But do you realize that there is a movement going on here, where most players are trying to stop publishers from monetizing games? We used to pay for games up front, but now we have to pay up front AND during the games. This has to stop, especially for games like FO76 that are buggy and lacking basic features. You can do what's best for you (buy Fallout 1st), or you can help us send a message to the fat cats on the publisher's board of directors (stop charging us for features that used to be free).
---
The F2P players... Lol
---
Didn't know I was signing up for a F2P model when I bought the game for $60.
---
There is about 1.5k active fo76 players on this forum and 10k people hate fallout first subscription... any bells?
---
and never will, autocorrect.
---
Gotta wear the NCR Armor and do the mothman emote to REALLY send people over the deep end
---
Ps. I have the sub. So we could do it on a clean server with none on it
---
Look man there are a lot of 15 year old kids in the gaming community who act elitist and superior and call other names for buying/playing something.If you like it buy it if you don't,don't buy it 
---
If YOU are getting your moneys worth from whatever they are offering thats the only thing that should matter
---
block and report anyone who attacks you on a personal level and continue to have fun
---
You said your own community "here". I made an observation. Let me know when you find that.
---
I'm down, is your psn same as user?
---
I agree, while nothing I was doing of that level of "this sucks" I had just taken the munitions factory and JUST set up the generators and never even got to loot the ammo
---
Find people to play with. You'd be surprised how being in a team with mic's can increase your survivability. Call outs, focus fire, and ammo/med sharing makes it a much better experience than competing with your own teammates for loot.
---
And by the time they need to use it again, they've probably earned those Atoms via challenges.
---
You are absolutely hopeless.
---
Dammit you beat me to it ü§£
---
Yeah Im in the secret vendor competition
---
[XB1X] I can't log in either Tryin to make a change :-\
---
  Your Faction alignment idea reminds me of FO:NV, where if you are actively helping one faction, the other factions NPCs attack you on sight.  Not really an issue.
---
However the open PVP against other faction players idea - can you remain neutral (pacifist), would you be forced to choose a faction up front, or would faction alignment depend on karma-ish values, or what questline you happened to be working what if you had multiple quests from opposing factions active) ?
---
If forced, then you've basically recreated Survival mode - along with the normal enemies, you'd now have factin NPCs, and up to 23 human players potentially of other faction alignments (how many with TSEs?) attacking at the same time....  
---
No thanks.  
---
If I wanted 24/7 PVP, I'd would have played survival or b spending all my time in NW, not playing Adventure w/ pacifist on.
---
&gt;too obsessed
---
The irony in that statement...
---
&gt;The only toxic people I encounter are on reddit and youtube.
---
because both of those sites are filled to the brim with teenagers who can't comprehend the concept that video games are subjective entertainment
---
True.  That part of me is too late to change )
---
i actually enjoy it when there are lots of other player camps around my merchant CAMPS, a tight concentration of CAMPS seems to bring in more customers to an area!  So i hope people dont use it to block other camps
---
Made up facts? Like what? ;)
---
cool bye
---
Awesome!
---
Audible yawn
---
Understood. Thanks for your elaboration.
---
That would be the hope.  
---
And other people who REALLY want it, can always just buy a $5-er of atoms
---
wasn't reddits favorite idom "vote with your wallet"?
---
X-01 top and arms are cool for that bulky neck ring. Excavator and x-01 helmets look really cool imo. Those can be mixed with just about anything
---
You do realize i seen the FO76 presentation, right? He wasnt being specific at all. Want me to prove it?
---
People who are responsible for that mess should be fired !
---
This is gold üòÇ
---
Anything said by any member of the bethesda team is not a legal contract. Thus they have zero obligation to deliver on what was "promised". If you don't like their choices I can understand but your own personal experience is not altered except for seeing some items at another players camp or person. Does seeing a tent really cause that much trouble?
---
Yeah, they're down for maintenance to hopefully fix the scrap box issues, and a few other emergency fixes from the mess two days ago.
---
 There is about 1.5k active fo76 players on this forum and 10k people hate fallout first subscription... any bells?
---
Does it prevent you from doing ANYTHING in this game...???
---
No... It doesn't...
---
You're obviously spending too much time in r/FO76.  :)
---
i lime key like pie
---
PS. üá≠üá∞
---
yes, they announced maintenance on twitter to fix the scrap issue
---
Good one my man.
---
good point-- definitely has nothing to do with shipping a terrifically buggy product and adding little content to your game thinking people would want to pay yet again and regularly thereafter for an unfinished buggy product; actually it's just because we're all griefers/jobless neets in the basement/entitled to free stuff!
---
Dudette, my apologies. Well I hope you and your daughter enjoy the game.
---
We have a can at work thats labeled "extra screws" and it makes me think about how i need them in game.
---
Apparently you've never gone to Uranium Fever or hung out at White Springs Train Station.
---
No. I‚Äôve watched it as well. It‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs an online game.
---
okay but how do you feel about fallout 1st
---
(this is rad though, thank you for sharing!! It's got me feeling inspired.)
---
Yes, i would love a cookie
---
That's also true! Once they're enabled they won't stop, and merely engage in bottom feeding. Most video game companies have become this as of late though...I dislike grind overall (it's so grindy to get you to pay money) so boycotting these products completely is actually not that hard for me.
---
&gt; I made an observation. Let me know when you find that. 
---
Umm... found it...?
---
Take your silver, because I agree.
---
If the issues were as bad as everyone makes them out to be, they'd have left the game.  The fact they're dedicating so much time to the game a year after release shows obviously they've gotten their money's worth out of it üôÑ
---
If they said Wastelanders will be locked behind Fallout 1st, I'd be with you...
---
Fuck even if they said events (Meat Week / Faschnacht / vault raids / etc) were locked to Fallout 1st only I'd be with you...
---
But if I don't pay the $13, all I miss out on is 1650 Atoms, some emotes/icons, NCR outfit, junk stash, and private worlds....
---
Im not missing out on anything gameplay related...
---
They stop filling at 24, but they can hold up to 30 so that people can invite friends into an otherwise "full" world.
---
Interesting point - thanks
---
Guns are harder to render so it adds alot of server strain because they have many mods, paint jobs, and many different models
---
Same go for PA pieces and paintable armors
---
No, they cant just enjoy the game. 
---
They need to vent, cry and whine until they find others that they can cuddle with who will tell them they are right and everything will be sunshine and rainbows because the big bad bethesda hurt them.
---
Not gonna lie, you had us in the first half
---
would have made it if not for the surprise maintenance
---
I buy atom bundles regularly, not just freeloading, i do pay them.
---
I'm just going to keep blaming both. Two sides to the same shit coin.
---
Imagne being tempted to buy stuff in fallout shelter when you can just time glitch.
---
Ehh, items like the fridge aren't gamebreaking, I literally bought one so my camp's kitchen would be complete
---
Haha! It‚Äôs also awesome replying to haters...haha! Well played...lol
---
You seem to forget about the part where we paid full AAA price for a game the quality of an early access indie game.
---
Then maybe upgrade your internet. 
---
I have no issues on console.
---
Not happy? Don‚Äôt play. Make peace with it, move on with your life. Simple as that. Now y‚Äôall are just talking shit to talk shit. It‚Äôs a you problem, not a me problem. Cause guess what? You DON‚ÄôT HAVE TO PAY FOR IT! Pretty freaky right?
---
‚ÄúAll the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,‚Äù explains Hines; ‚Äúall the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That‚Äôs important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there‚Äôs a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we‚Äôre going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you‚Äôre getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I‚Äôm getting that stuff for free. That feels right.‚Äù -Peter Hines
---
ya your probably right I'm not %100 sure either, in all fairness they have probably changes the spawning mechanics in the game a few times by now to combat people exploiting.
---
Heads up there‚Äôs no less then three distinct ranger outfits in the files. 
---
Pretty sure next week people will get their wish.
---
Was a time frame given?
---
The only thing that Bethesda did wrong was releasing a premium service with such big critical bugs. Even mobile developers don't do that.
---
Even if the feature was released without bugs, The outside community would still have complained about the price. It's really expensive and i agree with that but only with that. But i will not hold Bethesda accountable for the money grab. So many people are angry and they have never played the game. 
---
You guys have the only right to be angry at Bethesda. You guys are still playing and supporting the game. And if you stopped supporting and playing this game and only then Bethesda will change. It's also fine if you don't mind paying to support Bethesda. A online world requires maintenance and money so i understand that, But not this much. The price of the monthly subscription is so high that i see this game as a cash grab. 
---
For a online multiplayer game is see way to few improvements. So yes in my eyes this is a cash grab game. If they supported the game and didn't released a (cheaper) Premium feature with critical bugs i wouldn't have said that.
---
Glad to hear that you're happy with it. People who get the service seem to be happy with it, which is fine, but just not interested in paying another layer of subscription to play a game that I've already paid a subscription fee to play once. 
---
You start down rabbit holes like this, where do they end?
---
Not just the P2W stuff lately, bro. It's the fact that the game is still a money-grubbing buggy mess. I remember back in the day when $100 bought me a house, with enough change to get an egg cream back at the general store.
---
How do you guys love trash so much?
---
I rarely do a queen nuke anymore.  I like nuking different places just to see what happens
---
I'm aware. It's just one of those pet peeves because a lot of people use it as justification for why the game is "bad". 
---
"I tried attacking my opponent with Worker Units and they all died super fast and my opponent whooped me! I hate RTS!"
---
lol, il reinstall the game and give u some stuff if u rlly want xD
---
Agree 100 percent. It's annoying just trying to log in after a hard day and they pull this crap always around same time of day. 
---
And know how you feel at SBQ had same a week ago nuked 3 times didn't finish even 1 with the shit server we had and everybody crashing.
---
Looks great but does the scorchbeast leave you alone?
---
That lime will go great with all the salt folks left here. Now where's the tequila and Cointreau?? üôÇ
---
You will get your atoms cheaper with the sub.  its like a 40% discount, if you just look at the atoms.  Thats not including all the other free stuff you get, that would most likely cost you about 3k atoms from the store if they made the items available (judging by past pricepoints)
---
i was scared thinking i was somehow banned because it was different than with other maintenance. but im glad its some official work going on
---
Thank you for the silver.
---
I expected ... expected to be downvoted to h__l
---
Why thank you. My daughter said she‚Äôs never had so much fun and can‚Äôt wait to play again tomorrow. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôd let her play alone and only stayed near the vault but it was good having no worries that some player might come by and spoil it.  And thank you for not giving me a hard time for buying it, because I‚Äôm sure you want too.
---
Even Beth rents the servers meaning they probably don't think the game will stay alive for long.
---
It's all scrap
---
I haven't watched one single damn YouTube video on this. I was a bit of an apologist for Bethesda early on too. I had hope that things would be fixed.
---
However, I shelved the game months ago. I gave up hope of them making meaningful progress on fixing things anytime soon.  At first I hoped they'd pull a NoMan's Sky, and make some major effort to addressing areas of dissatisfaction down the road, but I don't think that's happening. I saw steps in the wrong direction and steps that felt more like greedy efforts to squeeze more money out of its players than fixing core problems. 
---
But this... When I heard about how much they backpedaled and how much of a blatant money grab this appears to be, not only did I give up hope of every coming back to this game, I gave up hope on Bethesda as entire company. I'm done with them.
---
Not getting riled by YouTubers. I don't give a damn about post karma. I haven't followed any other forums or subreddits. No bandwagon. I'm just a long-term Bethesda customer for roughly 30 years, but I'm done.
---
&gt; Because nobody expected to have to pay for a private world, 
---
Everybody who had a tiny clue did.
---
I got fallout 1st and it's great. A private world for me and my friends and no toxic people exactly what I wanted a co op fallout
---
rough estimate, i didnt check. 7 cores at the very least. Hard to tell when your cores dont get used up completely
---
Wastelanders would have been done if they didn't waste their time on this private server stuff
---
They won't make you pay for Wastelanders. But parts of it will surely be behind a paywall (some companions, for example), or even with the Fallout 1st sub.
---
Just FYI, it runs infinitely better on a private world. Silo runs too. I'll never do 94 on a public server again. Almost all the lag issues were gone.
---
Yeah i myself do not play rpg:s that are nothing but repetitive "kill this x times" quests.
---
Because those games suck
---
Can‚Äôt enjoy when I‚Äôm playing my well spent $99.99 BL3: Super deluxe edition. Can only enjoy one game at a time.
---
Yeah.  But only after they've fully tested it.
---
I don't mind being used as a Guinea pig, which seems a good use of First subscribers.  They'll get shit First, get it?  But after it's been fully tested it should be rolled out to everyone in some form or fashion.
---
I've seen a little about the scrap boxes losing your junk, but since I have it, I keep half my materials in it just in case, if it does get fixed, great I was pretty good on stash room before the subscription anyways
---
Yeah I‚Äôm hoping they are fixing it as we speak.  I don‚Äôt have high hopes, but maybe they‚Äôll surprise me and the rest of the community.
---
A large amount of people would have left for the Outer Worlds anyways and stop playing 76 for a while (new is always better) and maybe come back to check out Wastelanders. Since Bethesda was planning on implementing a monthly service, I think this was a genius move, instead of having two mass exoduses (Outer Worlds &amp; Service), just have one. In the end, people are bound to leave 76 with all the new games that are coming out in this fall/winter season.
---
They are down while they play Outer Worlds....
---
Salty Reddit being salty.
---
Join the Me 1st Membership for 15$ a month, and you can have my stuff.
---
Out of curiosity (I'm trying to understand) 
---
Why did you buy the 100$ pass anyways in the first place? (Or paid 13$ / month for that matter)
---
No kidding. You and I are not so different.
---
I know, and i might do in the future :)
---
 Its a fucking game making company. Why would I care whether they "look out" for me. The game is good.
---
I really wish some of their choices were different. I wish Fallout 76 had private servers that were free. 
---
However I don‚Äôt think the game met market expectations and they needed a way to increase revenue if they were still planning to keep ‚Äúcore dlc‚Äù free. Should the game have free private servers? Yeah. Can I understand why they aren‚Äôt? Yeah.
---
On the other hand I am used to playing Ark: Survival and it‚Äôs many different server options are a clear indication that this sort of thing is possible. 
---
Ark has singleplayer options, free server options, split-screen, local private co-op, paid dedicated servers, and local dedicated servers. Like c‚Äômon.
---
This mentality is the reason the game industry is the way it is now. So fuck no, fuck this game and fuck Bethesda to infinity.
---
If only that happens it's still ridiculous and scummy.
---
You realize that if they were actually testing things before releasing them they wouldn't need the player base to test it for them? You realize that if the game wasn't online required then it wouldn't need test servers to see if something is going to completely break the game when it is launched?
---
You also realize that this game is now a year old and they want people to pay a subscription fee for features that should have been in the game a year ago?
---
Do you also realize how patronizing this "you realize" rhetoric is? :P
---
If there's a way to piss off customers while simultaneously milking them, Bethesda will figure it out and do it twice. How long till Outer Worlds drops? Oh yeah....seeya Bethesda!
---
Because fo76 is a test. They dont care about success they care about data. Finding out how far they can push their fanbase.
---
fair point never really thought of it that way LOL
---
That‚Äôs really interesting that you‚Äôre just cool with it. It doesn‚Äôt make you angry that you‚Äôre having to pay a subscription for the game?
---
It's all in my original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm6iyp/full\_list\_of\_mischief\_night\_rewards\_odds\_of/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm6iyp/full_list_of_mischief_night_rewards_odds_of/)
---
Bye bye Bugthesda
---
I really appreciate it. Got any good stuff? I'm on PC
---
)) isn‚Äôt there a recipe for that
---
wait why dont you just empty them? you reload half way to be full when she lands? must be cool to solo her. i might get it for a month to check it out. get all the asylum outfits while im at it lol
---
Yeah, was planning to do a run on a private one, thinking the same thing :P
---
Yeah, I suspect ‚Äúa very small percentage‚Äù really means ‚Äúeveryone experiencing this lost their junk‚Äù, but I hope I‚Äôm wrong.
---
It is. They are going to do it anyway.
---
I'm not missing it - it's just a little disheartening that so many are willing to put up so much for so little. As polarizing as F076 was on launch, I did buy it and enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. That being said, I truly think based on the lessons Bethesda learned last year - as they've gradually burned their brand to the ground - that we'll never get another great game from them. It may not be 100% rational, but forgive me if I take a couple of extra days before begrudgingly moving on. Bethesda games were a huge part of my life for almost 20 years and it's very sad to see what they've become - sadder still to see gamers I likely have a lot in common with giving a full-throated endorsement of the New Bethesda.
---
Just out of curiosity, why do all supporters of this pull Hines‚Äô comment about DLC but forget the rest of the statement where he talks about all future content and updates being free?
---
People who don‚Äôt play fallout 76 regularly aren‚Äôt abandoning it, maybe they just lost interest for a while, maybe they‚Äôre preoccupied with work. The comparison is still not equal.
---
I guess who's to say the "first" doesn't stand for early subscribers... Who get the tents/stash/outfit 1st...then a few months down the road they sell them via atom shop.
---
I'm thinking almost like Day One edition gamrs/consoles
---
It‚Äôs a component in crafting solar, thorn, and strangler heart armor. The plans for those are rewards for vault raids.
---
I've got it too, so that's the plan!
---
Then how about killing a 3* getting a 1*, not being able to respawn anywhere, godmode, invisible enemies, falling trough the map, junk dissapearing,... do i have to keep going?
---
Ahhh! That's a good theory!
---
 You slightly miss my point. I probably would not have bought Fallout1 if Reddit had not gone nuts. That's really why I bought a month. ;)
---
Have to love how they instantly fix a glitch when it comes to their premium service but they haven't fixed any of the trade glitches and various other ones
---
I‚Äôm terrified to see what they do to elder scrolls.
---
Right. I'm like damn Bethesda is some how reading my negativity and banning my account.
---
Ill b e honest.  The atoms alone made the decision easy.  
---
I ususally spend about 10 bucks a month on atoms.  For basically the same price I get an extra 550 atoms.  
---
No brainer.
---
I mean i have a contract with an agency that says i cannot do business with anyone but them in that said subject so am i now a monopoly.
---
Selling one game from a certain publisher is quite far from a monopoly.
---
It has something to do with the armor from the vault raids.
---
Nobody sat here with expectations to pay for your own lobby, especially when almost all of the people requesting it, requested it for themselves, not for their friends.
---
I didn't, not for one moment. And if you expected to pay for your own personal lobby, there's something wrong with your trust with the studio's game you're playing.
---
If you expected to pay, why do you like Bethesda? Knowing this is their attitude when it comes to monetisation? Why do you stand for it/accept it rather than voice change?
---
Yeah I guess it is kind of lame to have to explain a poorly written point with flimsy reasoning conjured on the spot in order to preserve your fragile self esteem from an inconceivabley small amount of pushback.
---
Dude no one was "opposing you" 
---
Chill out.
---
And that logic is why the game community is fucked because they dont care about you or the game just the money in your wallet
---
Yea its like you hate this game and bethesda so much, move on. Go play outerworlds and never look back. But they continue to troll.
---
You also have the people who either never bought it or played it but somehow still hate it and the people who quit months ago that decided to come back to the subreddit to call everyone idiots
---
Apparently didn't put enough words, that was supposed to be a what they previously said was wrong.
---
Nope. If anyone loots it, you don't get it. Way too many times I wasn't able to make some fluxes because of that.
---
&gt;However the game itself is fine, even good in some aspects, yet the majority of hate I‚Äôve seen is aimed towards the game
---
Oof. Ok dude. Each to their own I guess.
---
Glad you fixed it
---
Sounds like Vaas from Farcry 3.
---
I mean...you're enabling the Devs to do this shit. 
---
"Yep let me go buy this $100 a year subscription to this horrible mess of a game. That'll show the Devs we don't like what they did!"
---
Game is not free.
---
I'm curious why all these people talking shot about FO76 are even on this sub-reddit.... "this game is a dead zombified corpse... But I'm going to keep spending my time on reddit until everyone wise agrees with me because I'm insecure about my position on the matter."  If you hate FO76 that much, please leave the game and the sub-reddit.  Simple as that.  To the people that paid for the subscription, your opinion doesn't matter because it's what they like, and to the people who agree with you, it makes no difference.
---
No after actually reading their comments and seeing that some state they uninstalled the game... keyword ‚Äúgame‚Äù. 
---
It‚Äôs a product of society and people wanting ‚Äúfree‚Äù stuff and thinking business should agree with them... 
---
Oddly employees get this thing called a paycheck... you want a better game you hire more people and make it better. 
---
The game has in fact improved since day 1 drastically... maybe not your speed but you can‚Äôt deny it. 
---
Pissing people off? Really? World of tanks is two teams the literal object is to destroy the enemy tanks... so if you played you‚Äôd not shoot and let them kill you then?...lol
---
Do you say the same toward those that like PvP when they kill? Probably not...  
---
People get salty over getting killed and even more so comments... people can‚Äôt hack someone thinking different than them. 
---
With that said... there is criticism and bitching... there is also a thing called constructive criticism where you want the object to get better and usually doesn‚Äôt include blasting individuals or the company. 
---
Big difference between communication and effective communication also. 
---
So your assumption wasn‚Äôt correct at all, far from.
---
 Its my ninth machine, I build em' every once in a while. My first was a 120 Pentium built to play Doom.
---
 I am on a pension but I love my games and bite the bullet to build machines to play on. This one took me almost 6 months to assemble as I can't afford to just buy the bits. I have to do it over time.
---
if you own the game, you can play it for free. no subscriptions
---
Or with the rate this diabolical is going, 15 weeks from now. If you cant lock the server when your on it and its spawning with used/dead NPCs, why not just play without?
---
Yep me too bud
---
I simply urge anyone considering handing Bethesda $100 for this hot garbage to also consider what good they could be doing for their communities instead. 
---
For example, I sometimes volunteer and donate to a local organization that provides meals to children from poor and rough households and pays off student loan debts and I‚Äôve been told $100 can provide 40-50 meals when combined with the volunteer labor in preparing that number of meals
---
I know that pain, I wanted to pad my stash a bit last night, but my power went out because someone ran into the lightpole in front of my house.
---
Presumably you've been playing the game for a year, in which case there has obviously been enough content to keep you going for a year.
---
How many hours have you put into the game?
---
The way I see it there's more than enough content in the game to keep me happy.  if there's not enough for you, please, just find another game.  No reason to talk shit about other people enjoying a game you don't.  If we all enjoyed the same games there'd be no reason to have more than 1.
---
Imagine being this blind.
---
Because some whales will always pay, and Bethesda realized that a couple of months ago when they started selling utility items.
---
The father lost interest in taking care of his family but he came back eventually. Of course he's planning to abandon them again on a regular basis. Should he be treated equally as other family members? I don't think so. As I said, most family would just call the cops
---
maintenance
---
You‚Äôd think the servers would be able to handle regular gameplay.
---
Same..... unscheduled maintenance?
---
My wallet  is out of commission thanks to a washing machine.
---
Lol yeah I don‚Äôt really get the appeal. But that‚Äôs no reason to harass someone having fun with their kid.
---
He is a consumer who saw something with his money.  He is not a "bad guy".  These comments remind me of the typical *woke* assholes that criticize me for eating Chick Fil A.  Get off your high horse.  This is capitalism, suck it up buttercup.
---
Okay thanks everyone!
---
 Is it snowing where you are?
---
Wth it was down all day Weds now again.
---
Wreck their bases
---
My ALL TIME favorite defense of Bethesda is "BUT LOOK AT ALL THE FREE DLC YOU'VE GOTTEN". Sadly, the DLC they speak of is not even an extra days worth of content.
---
Maintenance for premium services.
---
They are fixing the junk box issues.
---
They publicly posted a few threads on the official forums
---
You supporting Bethesda's decisions here pisses people off. Maybe don't make yourself a target by wearing proof of purchase.
---
It was a fan made deathclaw head decoration.
---
with Survival down, this is the perfect time to have an event like this..
---
lol you cant choose a solo session in GTA online, you have to glitch into one. Nice try tho.
---
&gt;Oh so it pulls you to the main screen then drops you right back into the same server?
---
Yes, and it's tied to your account not the character. I used my level 260 guy to drop a nuke, cleared the ghouls, and then logged in with my level 50 alt to power level her.
---
It also means you can transfer stuff between characters without needing a friend. Just drop stuff in a container, switch characters, and scoop it all up.
---
Todd got upset and banned everybody.
---
This is amazing
---
Oh yeah, like I said, Ubisoft is still far from perfect, they're definitely still scummy. They just usually release good games with comparatively less predatory behaviors than their peers. That isn't saying a whole lot, of course, but it's enough for me personally to not avoid buying their games, whereas with EA, I specifically don't buy anything from them. Plus, if we do buy their less predatory games that shows them that they should continue to make more, so for the same reason I'll be happy to buy Fallen Order from EA if it somehow comes out with minimal or no microtransactions to show them that they should make more games like that.
---
Just dont buy Fallout 1st or their next game until they step up.
---
Also WoW also charged excessively to buy the game, and a monthly sub, and to purchase every expansion.
---
If it's not a good comparison its only because Bethesda has been trying hard to NOT do exactly what they should have done on day 1: pay to play.  None of this freeloading shit.
---
And now it‚Äôs $10. Business models change. They changed theirs.
---
What people shouldn‚Äôt do often overlaps with what people actually do. Getting people to change is difficult, fixing the game so this problem can‚Äôt grief or inconvenience others is much easier.
---
Don't let the door hit you where the dark lord licks you..
---
I can appreciate the desire to fix this as quickly as possible, but yeah, this was very abrupt.  I think there was less than 10 minutes between the announcement and the downtime.  I wasn't doing anything special, but it was quite awkward.
---
You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd be able to stop these exploits after a year. But I think the other poster I replied to is right, the servers can‚Äôt handle regular gameplay.
---
No problem
---
If I had a large enough 3D printer and some skill, i'd print out the entire cast of Faschnact robots ("life" sized) and deliver them to Helvetia.
---
ah, it's all good :)
---
That‚Äôs the one thing I have yet to try! And now...maintenance!
---
Bye Felicia, don‚Äôt let the door hit ya in the ass on the way out!
---
Was this morning but not anymore :)
---
Its a recycled bug that Ive seen in FO4 and Skyrim.
---
I 100% agree. Its popular to be toxic - it get likes, subscribes all that sorta nonsense, so people in that sphere tend to gravitate towards reactionary criticism.
---
I have always found the community in-game to be overwhelmingly positive. I recently started a new character to run a friend (who is a new player) through the early levels and within the first hour we'd had 4 encounters with high level dudes emoting and dropping us some shit to help us through. We even had a bit of pvp at Morgantown Airport. 
---
The games got it issues, I'm not a hard defender. Just sayin, as someone who's played quite a bit - I like the playerbase üëå
---
Oh god you are all pathetic
---
My camp is here too!  I went with less church/more witch, but I like yours too, especially the altar.
---
Hey man I don't want to waste my time nor yours. Imma pass on shiet stuff
---
Ah man, sounds like a pain! I hope you get to enjoy the game tonight :)
---
Lol, I could see that occurring. The wrath of Todd!
---
lol k
---
This guy is a masochist
---
I think some people are being jerks because this sub has caused so much misinformation and hatred. A lot of people are over reacting without actually knowing what they are talking about, just making stuff up, and/or believing it all. I hate to say it, but it's not as bad as others make it out to be. They offset the cost with Atoms, include some nice features, and you get a few Atomic store items too. Sure, I agree the tent and scrap box could have been free, and the popular outfit maybe given for free to thank the users, but Bethesda is a for profit company and nothing says you have to buy it.
---
Surly you are even overreacting a bit, you admit to not having played for months, you didn't even play for a few hours to see how the game is, didn't experience any of the updates over the last few months for yourself. You just believed the over exaggerated vitriol of a tiny portion of the player base and just uninstalled.
---
Thats probably why some people are being jerks.
---
I think people would lose their shit if Wastelanders was locked to private servers.
---
Dont use the hard r. Gamer is our word you can use gamea.
---
Lol your right
---
No, because they publicly annoucned they are changing the original vision for the game.  The no fee thing was not viable to shareholders and their bottom line. 
---
So they made a sub.
---
The original promises are still intact.  You do not have to subscribe to play the content.
---
 What do you need? I can get it from my private server. ;)
---
it's not a good "gameplay driven" game, sure, but it's not all bad. Judging a game only on one thing, even if it's the more important, is not that clever.     
---
(and saying all that isn't saying "oh, Bethesda gave us a very good game, I'll ask more of this")
---
Yes ive read that here too, massive piss off Im sure if found to be true. I'm just done with the game, slowly got less interested, bugs and crashes screwing me in the few hours a week i get to game. Going to start up Outer Worlds today.
---
Normally the Dr.'s grab your junk, but not in the wild.
---
They never promised not to have a paid service....
---
But, you *don't have to buy the subscription*. You can still log in today, and play the exact same game you played last week. 
---
No   one   lost   **anything**.
---
"Why cant game be like completely different game! Why bethesda, why!?"
---
You're conflating "good" and "successful." Bethesda has proven time and again that the former is *not* a prerequisite of the latter.
---
It seems like the circle should just be a lot smaller for this mini camps right?
---
Did you sign a contract that said youll get all that?
---
I don't think you have any right to attack anyone based off what they want
---
Olive trap
---
LMFAO
---
I'm in too! Just don't know tonight already 9pm for me and can't get in the damn game yet cause of maintenance lol
---
Probably wouldn't make much if I was :)
---
He can play it on my machine, which is below minimum spec, and has none of the "debilitating" issues others claim to have
---
Yeah of all the places I visited in my trip I took the most photos there ( getting all the mask photos was a majority of pictures taken )  the restaurant was worth wandering into even if you didnt get a meal simply for all the old photos , antiques and additional masks located in there . I look forward to seeing /hearing where else you visited.  ps I had several people good naturedly roll their eyes at me or chuckle over how I'm a video game tourist but they all loved that a it drew in more visitors .
---
That guy is wrong on the timer. I tested it myself a couple days ago, and you have at least 15 minutes before your server goes away unless the server itself crashes.
---
Like we have already replied to the last 28310 who asked:
---
Couldn't they just take down the private servers only.
---
Same psn
---
Haha awesome
---
&gt; video game subscriptions have been a thing before most redditors were even born 
---
I think we both know that it was clearly different. The sub was up front, the cost didn't change based on the publisher's whimsy, and generally the game both worked and had consistent new content. None of those things are true here. I'm all for subs, but I think it's important for developers/publishers to uphold their ends of the social contracts they enter.
---
There was a way to pivot to a subscription based model, games have done it before. How Bethesda went about it was about the most anti-consumer way you could go about it. There's really no disagreeing over this pivot to subs being poorly handled.
---
&gt; video games also got more expensive to manufacture,people demanded less from video games 10 years ago than they do now
---
I'm so tired of this "but think of the poor, starving video game executives!" line of thinking. Publishers make more money and post more profit than they ever have in history too. If they can't find a way to make games without exploitative measures then they're proving there isn't a viable way to make and sell video games.
---
The thing is... plenty of publishers make successful games without alienating or treating their fans like garbage. Let's be clear, Bethesda are clearly an outlier here. I'm enjoying the shit out of Borderlands right now and plenty of other games from publishers that aren't trying to nickel and dime me in exchange for nothing.
---
As consumers we're _way_ too quick to say "Oh shucks, Bethesda sure is having a hard time. We should take it easy on them and just gift them money." They're a business full of adults, they'll be fine. They're a profitable company before all of this, but their shitty financial structure is collapsing underneath them. That's not my fault, your fault, the developers fault... It's the executives fault, and I'm not shedding tears for millionaires maybe becoming slightly-less millionaires.
---
Hopefully they are fixing the flocks or legandary scorchbeats I keep stumbling on. Ten at once all two and three stars. Died quick.
---
It doesnt go in any way against what they said
---
Perfect timing with the rainstorm and thunder!
---
Happy Halloween üéÉ!
---
I understand your point. I could've given it a chance after this latest update, but I feel cheated and lied to by Bethesda. I've gotten to a point where the game is no longer fun for me anymore and this last subscription they put out really pissed me off.
---
Agreed, don‚Äôt listen to the whales
---
I'd rather be an asshole than a liar. You are the scum of the earth.
---
You can't store bloatfly glands in the scrap box. It breaks down junk to its core component. (Acid)
---
I don't fully agree with the approach taken by Bethesda with FO-1st.  As someone already suggested, Bethesda should make it possible to buy the FO-1st with atoms earned in-game (most likely this will be done sometime in the future).
---
However, many of the threads are just "too much".  Overstressing minor benefits, overhyping importance of others, simply providing false information ... ...  Does anyone truly expect that a company will be able to support a product without some incoming revenue?
---
Criticism is good - and there was good constructive criticism and many good suggestions... that were hard to pick out among everything else.
---
Yes yes they will but what you don't know is it'll be episodic so 50 bucks every 3 hours of game play have fun
---
That was due to being rushed
---
They also didn‚Äôt read the TOS or EULA...
---
Cause gta5 can afford a shit ton of servers where fallout 76 cannot
---
Highly doubt it
---
Feelsbadman I put a fair bit of money in this game back when I thought it would smooth itself over, but now it seems like it's commiting ritual suicide. Back to Dark Souls I guess
---
&gt; Presumably you've been playing the game for a year, in which case there has obviously been enough content to keep you going for a year.
---
HA!
---
&gt; How many hours have you put into the game?
---
about 30 before I was fed up with bugs and the empty world
---
&gt;  No reason to talk shit about other people enjoying a game you don't.
---
yes there is. Because you're enabling Bethescam to continue taking advantage of people like you while you thank them for doing so.
---
&gt; If we all enjoyed the same games there'd be no reason to have more than 1.
---
again, it's not about how fun the game is, it's about how they're treating players. Overproming and underdelivering. Completely broken mechanics. Bait and switch tactics. There's not even NPC's in the game yet. 
---
It's a joke and you're in on it.
---
&gt;attack a fellow gamer
---
only real gamers do this
---
Extended my subscription to a full year after reading this
---
And how many hours of gameplay have you gotten out of that $60? 
---
Also, I asked for games that werent primarily populated by children.  It's easy to get a bunch of kids to fork over their parents' cash on pointless bullshit.
---
Bethesda should have never made that bullshit promise.
---
And talking about comparisons, shitty mobile games arent even close.
---
OK. I'll see what I come up with. I can finally run nuke zones without pissing everyone off. ;) 
---
 'yonggo' in game?
---
I‚Äôve heard that you do.
---
Did you read the TOS or EULA or just click through all that? 
---
Every online and every game has them... most don‚Äôt read them.
---
i'm complaining that they have to fucking take down the production servers to implement fucking dev functions for a diffrent service. i'm a programmer and if you want to fix an issue in you shopping card website you don't need to take down the fucking whole site. if i can do that why the fuck can't bethesda. holy shit incompitent reddit aresholes.
---
Unless it naturally loads up with some ammo already there...
---
Why we can't have randomized loot boxes with 3 star legendary items and other goodies like in so many other games?
---
Thx appreciate the update!
---
Yes. But you bought the game.
---
Am I missing something here? Did Fallout 76 go free to play?
---
I don't hold it against people who like the game. We like what we like. Glad you're having fun.  
---
But with the premium subscription, if you feed the beast, you're part of the problem.
---
We've all been waiting for the game to get better.
---
I don't get how they don't understand this concept. 
---
I am against insulting people obviously, but ya'll need to stop pretending like the things you do have no consequences. You are indeed having impact on other people by purchasing this garbage. By purchasing it you are clicking the checkmark "I am fine with supporting anti-consumer practices, I am okay with hurting the future of fallout as well as gaming as a whole". Whether you want to or not, that's what you are subscribing to when supporting bethesda. 
---
Which results in people being mad at you for literally helping to ruin things they like.
---
Says a lot about your character
---
I give up on you, lmao. Youre a shill. An idiot, even. Maybe you'll realize that once they ruin your fun someday as well.
---
And they're not as heavily modified as the official forum.
---
Yep kinda quit with fo76 well before this update. I've gone back to finish assassin creed origins and odyssey. Fo4 is even better than this, especially with some of the mods that have come out. Not paying more just for a private server, the game isn't worth it.
---
I like you. You understand things.
---
Then you know what you should do my friend? Don't buy anything.. just don't do it you don't lose money and they don't make money, I could care less for what they do, I enjoy it because I have fun no worrying about micro transactions no worrying about delayed content what ever happens happens, I'll play the game because I want to not for the cosmetics and utility complaints
---
I feel like the entire Bethesda team probably has set times throughout the day where they are required to do social media defense. There are some serious head-in-the-sand individuals posting in this thread.
---
Still cool, I only bought a month, but if I like the direction it goes, I'll probably buy a year
---
That's what I thought might be the case. Other than that alone I haven't seen any other evidence myself.
---
That's the beauty of the business model - you don't realize what you've actually lost until Bethesda sells you a solution for its deliberately tedious game design for an extra $100. I'm sure Starfield and Elder Scrolls 6 will be designed like Fallout 76 - OK, but deliberately tedious with several show-stopping features... to which they'll sell you the solution. Or in the cases of private worlds, marketed as a selling point for the base game ("not at launch, but WILL BE ADDED")... but unavailable unless you pay more. That's why I don't think Bethesda will ever make another genuinely good game again... and we've all lost because of that.
---
Private corporations still have stock, they're often given out as benefits in replacement of higher salaries. The company would buy them from internal employees. It would make sense if they tank their stock to buy it all back from their employees. But this is obviously an insane conspiracy theory lol
---
‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt buy it‚Äù
---
You only put in 30 hours and yet here you are a year later still focusing on it.  Bitter much?
---
And yes, it is about how fun the game is.  Because that's why we buy games.  That's literally the entire point.
---
And there are NPCs.  An NPC doesnt stop being an NPC just because it's not human shaped.
---
Stop being so reasonable! Don't you know this sub is only for hating on Bethesda? /s
---
Ubisoft i think has done the worst offense so far (other than battlefront 2 of course) you can buy literally everything in breakpoint and the game is made very grindy to incentivize it. Plus it basically is wildlands with a loot system that is pretty much pointless for anything other than drones that are there as a gear check.
---
Damn, I've been wanting to play Spiderman but I don't have a PS4 :( hahaha but I'm starting outer worlds today, it seems to be getting really good reviews
---
Lol already trying to shut it down. I just downloaded it for 1‚Ç¨ btw.
---
Can you sue for a broken promise? (Legitimate question)
---
The community was one of the only good things about this damn game and Bethesda just couldn't help but to fuck all of you over. It's so disappointing.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt realize an online multiplayer spinoff is online. Thanks for keeping it civil.
---
This sounds normal, how long do you typically expect to play a single game?
---
I blocked messages from who is not my friend since people saw I was playing Fallout 76 when everyone hated it
---
And none of you should have been positive.  You guys keep enabling this company to do fucked up things to its customers.  You've defended a game that since day 1 was a complete mess.  You wanna know why they released that way?  They knew you guys would overlook it because how much you love the series.  I've been done since they announced it would be online only, and will never spend money on anything they profit from again.  You want game industry to change?  Force them, we are their income.
---
People are looking for a reason to protest amid blizzards drama, still trying to ride that high. For some reason people care about karma and it's easy Pickings when drama unfolds.
---
So same as youre doing? Coming to the internet to bitch about something and agree with posts that have similar opinions?
---
You might be able to request another refund due to false advertising. You bought the game with an understanding that all DLC and any non-cosmetic features are free, since that is how it was advertised.
---
Marketing must be having a blast - selling a fully priced online game and then charging even more to play it single.
---
Trap branch
---
My rig is almost 3 years old (and wasn't custom or expensive when I got it).  It runs the game just fine.  I rarely have disconnects or crashes.
---
I feel ya, there are a lot of issues right now, but that's not really one of them.
---
You‚Äôre so dramatic
---
Game is absolutely fantastic! Great to play, great to watch on stream. Everything Bethesda Studios turned their back on for a slice of the scummy ‚ÄòLive Service‚Äô cash grab.
---
So when someone buys animal pelts of endangered species that's fine with you too because it's their money?
---
I fucking loved the game since release, I used to play it avidly, but with all of the shit Bethesda has done in regards to it I just cant stand by it anymore. I'm jist going to trade it in to get a dollar or two for The Outer Worlds
---
I'm there with you, as a way long time gamer I can remember the first time I held an atari 2600 controler in my hand, the first time I spent $20 trying to get the high score in Gauntlet (that quarter dump), from the CD Keys of every PC game released to prevent piracy, to mobile F2P games with IAP, to where we are now. 
---
I wouldn't say it's a full throated endorsement. Like it or not, as we saw the death of arcades, the fall of couch co-op and LAN parties, to the rise of having to pay an extra subscription just to get online with a console and the dominance of F2P games with microtransactions.  For the time being, this is where gaming is going.  I can either adapt and accept or yell at kids to get off my lawn.
---
Beep boop pay bethesda
---
So is this the thread where we can post about Outer Worlds?
---
It isn‚Äôt a threat and they don‚Äôt care lmao.
---
But I really do think that this reddit community has been a big contributor to the positive community on the site. Losing these players will change the future of the game; even if they don‚Äôt listen.
---
&gt; You only put in 30 hours and yet here you are a year later still focusing on it. Bitter much?
---
Absolutely I'm bitter. I paid $60 for a game that I couldn't even log into or was constantly booted to desktop. You bet your ass I'm bitter.
---
&gt; And yes, it is about how fun the game is. Because that's why we buy games. That's literally the entire point.
---
The enjoyment of the game and the treatment of its community can be mutually exclusive
---
&gt;  An NPC doesnt stop being an NPC just because it's not human shaped.
---
Semantics. You know what I mean
---
Thank you. I believe I have had enough of this as well. Tired of scrolling and seeing the hate train EVERY patch.
---
You're right, they aren't publicly traded, but private companies still have a valuation based upon the formal accounting concept of goodwill, which is roughly their reputation (or lack thereof) with former and potential future customers. Just because there's not a public share price doesn't mean that there isn't a trade-off between revenue and valuation.
---
about 90% of my friends on discord and in game remains happy, some of them bought subscription others don't happiness lvl seems mostly unaffected by fallout 1st.
---
Edit: I do agree that giving this for everyone will be a good move and i will still buy fallout first for other benefits.
---
butbutbut someone said something on twitter!
---
These days there might be ONE challenge a day that I even consider doing. I care nothing about the Vault 94 ones or the Nuclear Winter ones, so that eliminates at least 60% of the available challenges. 
---
That made me realize that I'm not playing the game for fun anymore. I'm playing it to get Atoms, which in turn I end up never spending because most of the stuff in the Atomic Shop is trash IMO.
---
Like the odds you seem to know about in a factual manner and totally didn't pull out your ass.
---
Oh god just give it a rest. If you don‚Äôt like it stop playing. Shut up and stop whining! It‚Äôs a video game! If you don‚Äôt like capitalism go hide in a tinfoil box in an alley. You are asking for socialism. It didn‚Äôt work for Russia. I love the game and am quite happy with the privileges 10.00 a month gets me. Not everyone gets to drive a Porsche.
---
imagine being called a sheep because you play a game you enjoy
---
Hey, they spend their money on these things and cry on here afterwards it's their money and they choose where it goes, if they don't spend it on 76 then maybe they won't cry wolf so often that I get a notification saying waaah waah this game is so evil
---
You just gotta try it first, then decide. Right?
---
Their argument is "but pete hines said something on twitter"
---
Yeah whaaa?! 
---
Positively negative is more like it.
---
What do you mean by pure Fallout? Because I've beaten every Fallout (with the exception of Tactics) and this is nothing like any of the other Fallouts as far as I'm aware.
---
It affects both servers. Though I wish we could at least play nuclear winter
---
Wow. Good one
---
Um.. bro thanks for the offer but I really would like the Items I mentioned above. I consider other weapons scrips as I'm pretty well geared. Wouldn't mind some scrip materials tho. IGN?
---
because they're drama queens
---
You can't play missions. Can't play Heists. Can't play DM's. Very limited amount of races you can do. Not sure if Random Events happen in a solo session either. So its hardly a good comparison.
---
Not really. I am very relaxed. And still am. If the voice in your head read it in a dramatic way, maybe its you who‚Äôs dramatic
---
I still entertain the theory but i‚Äôm with you here. The only up to date and relevant sources these days are the data in the game, player experiences with video proof. 
---
We can‚Äôt trust everything Bethesda says but neither can we rely on old and possibly outdated crumbs of evidence, with an interpretation of aforementioned data coming from a guy who only has a WIP bachelor‚Äôs in finance.
---
Where are these official forums? I keep reading about them but have never seen a link.
---
So brave.
---
I came here to see if there were actually people stupid enough to be still playing this game.
---
Dude I would love a flock of legendary scorchbeasts.
---
I'm with you lol, and the only one of those issues I've had is the respawn, and if you just leave it for a few minutes it'll let you respawn
---
I'll never understand the anger about legendary creatures either. The star number is the maximum number of stars the dropped item can have. If they dropped 3* 100% of the time the economy would be flooded with good items and they'd be worthless.
---
It's like people expect an online multiplayer game to have a single player economy.
---
No this isn't Fable, you can't infinitely buy emeralds and sell them back for a profit.
---
The subscription service does not go in direct violation because we were advised publicly in 2018 that the private servers were going to be a paid service:
---
My girlfriend bought one for her to play....MUHAHAHAHA! I played through RDR2 already, kinda lost interest 3/4ths the way through. I'm hyped about Spiderman, also thinking about picking up Horizon Zero Dawn. I've heard great things about that as well. I've heard the same as well about Outer Worlds. Let me know your experience. Probably won't get it till next week
---
Nah dude they are players.  People are fed up of them fucking up the franchise.  But by all means, keep enabling them and make them think they'll turn profit.
---
As someone who said that same thing a week or two ago to a coworker, we'd like to apologize we fucked up.
---
I have been a Bethesda fan since I was a kid and I see how Bethesda has manipulated its community into purchasing their broken game. Heres a small breakdown. 
---
* Purchased Fallout 76. Got a plastic bag instead of a Canvas Bag. $200.00
---
* All my information was leaked: [Bethesda Accidentally Leaked Personal Data of Fallout 76 Customers](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7xy789/bethesda-accidentally-leaked-personal-data-of-fallout-76-customers-looking-for-help) Not to mention Experian and all the other Credit Companies keep seeing weird changes on players Credit Reports, including mine.
---
* Now another $100 for a YEARLY Subscription to this game for promises of Unlimited Stashes and Private Servers when I was asking for that before launch? Not to mention the news today that EVERYONE can't get in the game and all their shit is gone? Can we add in how there are reports of Private Servers just being recycled?  [Players Say Fallout 76's Subscription Service is Busted, Bethesda Responds.](https://www.polygon.com/fallout/2019/10/24/20930729/fallout-1st-private-servers-glitches-bugs-problems-scrap-box-pc-ps4-xbox-one)
---
Bethesda is gross making a joke on how they can manipulate their player base. This Bethesda's update below: 
---
&gt;‚ÄúOur initial investigation indicated that this was a display issue, and that no items had gone missing,‚Äù a Bethesda representative told Polygon. ‚ÄúHowever, we have since found that a small number of players have in fact experienced a loss of scrap items after placing them into the Scrap Box and then loading into a world.  
---
&gt;‚ÄúResolving this issue is currently our top priority,‚Äù the representative said. ‚ÄúWe are also exploring ways to restore the missing items.‚Äù Developers are trying to come up with a hotfix to resolve the issue ASAP.
---
And the cycle continues. Let me know when Fallout 76 is *"fixed"*. But I don't think Bethesda will stop with their **CORRUPT BUSINESS PRACTICES** since they are a privately owned LLC**.** 
---
I would advise you to purchase OuterLands and save $40 this year.
---
Thanks for noticing my citrus loving friend :)
---
What am I trying tho?
---
Just go check it out if you want. No matter how you feel about this game in the current state, this sub isn't the place to try and convince people to play a different game. Seems kinda pointless here.
---
That's because reddit is not actually indicative of the playerbase as a whole, they may think they're the fo76 lorax but thats just their delusion
---
Sure! I have private too. PSN is experimenta_l
---
I think you misread what I said.
---
I said Bethesda needs utility items because ADULTS aren't going to spend money on cosmetic items.  Kids will pay for pointless bullshit that has no impact on gameplay... for the most part adults will not.
---
[It's true.](https://youtu.be/dFiNh1OU3K4)
---
The subscription
---
I actually wouldnt be happy with zero weight scrap. Then there would be zero downside to hoarding ALL junk you find. The tent already eliminates most of the downside to picking up everything by making your nearest drop-off point right outside any location.
---
And you keep the 1650 Atoms as well. Makes me it will not be very exlusive for long.
---
Which is getting fixed in a day after release cause others like me are paying for the service.
---
It‚Äôs not too far off. I posted in here a few months ago asking if the game improved from release and if anyone could help me get back into it and have some fun. Got downvoted to oblivion with no response just for saying the launch pushed me away lol
---
It's a shame. The map is great and it's fun to explore. At this point the saving grace for me would be an offline mode with NPC's, unlimited stash per system constraints, ability to build bigger and in more places like Fallout 4, and the ability to unlock all the skills I can.
---
Goofy wish being this is an online only game but clearly the implementation and operation went as it did. üòü
---
You expect us to give BGS credit for fixing a thing attached to a subscription model? Like giving them credit for fixing atom shop items and making sure the shop is as big free as possible? 
---
Since this shit is fixed to the detriment of the product as whole, nah. I'm not going to give credit to the asshole selling shit burgers because he fixed his busted cash register.
---
Well there is misinformation going around. I see people just spout off "omg beth charging for private servers reeeeeeeeee" and don't mention anything else. There's so many legitimate problems to state and they bitch about that one. The actual common business practice of having to pay for server space.
---
Like if you gonna bitch use actual arguments and they are there
---
I guess I'll assume it's for maintenance as well. 
---
Thing is I got log in fails earlier telling me it was for maintenance. 
---
These are different, these say entitlements just as the op says.
---
we should have a lemon party
---
You do you, I'll just [end on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuFl1lmn7cc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1175).
---
lol, don't worry, no one thinks it has anything to do with FO76
---
I was about to post this too. I'm on Xbox. I'm figuring it might have to do with the premium service that I shamefully bought. But I could really use the free junk storage and extra fast point. I just really hope they can drop the price and those that already paid get like extra atoms or something.
---
Idk but that choice is mine I guess. No game gives you free skins. Literally every single game offers players skins to buy for weapons and stuff.
---
I'm not going that far. I still do enjoy playing the game.
---
Ooh a bitchy and irrelevant Youtuber so fascinating.
---
I can't believe people are so brainwashed that they are still defending Bethesda. The OP is part of the problem of why they think they can get away with this crap
---
But you got the full game for 60$ why you telling bullshit you got an unfinished game?
---
I agree with that! Haven‚Äôt played borderlands 3 yet and I am curious about the next watchdogs but it doesn‚Äôt drop until next year!
---
Lol. I hope you feel the same way for the next hot fix that fixes something that impacts your gameplay. Addressing bugs is always a good thing.
---
I'd love a 2x1 or 2x2 limited space forward option, but truly limited. Not sure the tentbthing is all that. Be fun if you could customize it, but it is way too big from an area blocker.
---
Although if we had this months ago we could have blockaded the golf course from missile camps....
---
L......O......L!!!!!
---
Epic hasnt done anything wrong
---
They already said they aren‚Äôt. How many times does this need to be posted?
---
Its mandatory  if you want all the content, some of us spent all our gaming lives expecting a full product for a full price. Its not a complicated concept to get.
---
Lol they bought the game moron. Predatory micro transactions didn‚Äôt even exist ~6 years ago. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with buying a game and expecting it to work and not require additional spending
---
I bought the game on the promise that it would be "pay for cosmetic only". If you like to be lied, that is your problem. Me as a fallout fan and a customer, I don't like to be lied. Im just saying the community has the right to complain. People don't like to be fucked. Isnt that hard to understand? I like fallout, but bethesdshit constantly shit on their franchise and fans.
---
I actually like that junk/scrap ‚Äòweighs‚Äô something- I like the challenge of balancing the mix of items in my stash as it adds to the whole survival element. 
---
If you could/can just pick up whatever and whenever, you lose an element of challenge.
---
They are trying to go for EA's record...
---
True, but since the wattoga legendary purge i havent had a single 3* drop a 3*... i dont think thats normal
---
The amount of anger is making for a confusing message, but I think you're right. 
---
Paradoxically if they had made more use of the Atom shop, it may have decreased anger from many quarters.
---
In order for it to make any difference people have to not buy into it. The game has had its problems for sure and lots of us were willing to give it a try. But we can‚Äôt be feeding into this hot garbage or it‚Äôll never stop.
---
It's a capitalism thing, not a "big business" thing. The only caveat is that pretty much all big business is run by capitalists.
---
For what?
---
eh...do we know how many people are still playing FO76? a high percentage of a small number of people buying something doesn't say much.
---
You are wrong though. Saying they do not actively make other peoples lives worse is wrong. Game companies are in a business of money, and wish to make it. If they can squeeze the money away from you as Bethesda is doing at the moment, other companies will start to do the same.
---
You do not have to look far to see this. EA published FIFA with its card packs and what not, only for the same mechanics to leak into Battlefront 2 also.
---
I'm not going to ridicule person who bought into this, but they are absolutely contributing in turning this past time into experience full of lootboxes and subscriptions.
---
Yup, these business practices can only exist in an environment in which people buy into it. If it's valid to criticize the practice it's valid to criticize those who help perpetuate it.
---
If it was a convoluted connection between their purchase and the business practice that would be one thing, but they're literally buying the thing.
---
Prime combat rifles now use UC 45 ammo instead of 44 now too. That's a day 1 bug that was fixed.
---
LOL. This post exactly. I‚Äôm wondering what kind of communal utopia some people live in that they think it‚Äôs moral bankruptcy for a company to ask a fee for premium amenities, especially when those amenities are completely optional and offer no competitive advantage.
---
I don't think that's true lmao
---
I literally got 2 yesterday
---
That would be directly-related to Fallout 76, so allowed.
---
this game is never ever ever never ever going to be fixed ever you better just get the fun out of what you can get. en fucking play it at its current state because it's only gonna get worse. and after a while the servers are just gonne be shut down forever and then the game is dead forever that is more likey gonna happen then this game is going to be finished ever. just get that into your thick skulls. bethesda is not bethesda anymore and they don't listen ever. fallout76 is a piece of shit . so move on. i'm just playing the BR because that is the only fun thing in this game left.
---
My one friend I used to play with quit as well too. Kinda factored in
---
Right? Is this some sort of depressing support group for people that can't separate real life from video games?
---
Unfortunately it‚Äôs difficult.
---
:) think of how it would effect politicians and their promises
---
I can see that. It would have been better if this was a full priced DLC to fallout 4.
---
Pay to grind less has always been the fairer model to strike a balance when it comes to items that can influence gameplay for any game with microtransactions.  Its not a bad model for Bethesda to follow.  Not sure why they went down this "exclusive" sub-only route, other than bad decision making and failing to learn from other games.
---
Most of the players who complain to you on the console itself don't play the game and just doing it to be trolls and little kids that have nothing to do. But yea Xbox as a company does typically ban them from messaging for while if they write something inappropriate so report it and also if enough people report them then they get a nice message telling players beware of this player(I haven't seen someone with it for about a year so don't remember the exact words but seen it on more then one profile).
---
THIS IS GRAFTON‚ÄôS MAYOR
---
Yeah. And honestly there's so many fast travel points in this game that they really aren't necesarry. Now that scrap box though...that should be available to everyone... at least once it stops deleting scrap.
---
It should be good. Short for an rpg, but enjoyable while playing it.
---
 I have what I want so for me Lenendaries are just trade items for the Murmrgh game. I am happy to give stuff away. If I find what you want I'll invite you to my private server and give it to you. ;)
---
You can also build behind the pumpkin house.
---
The only thing which shut down around here are your brain cells my dude.
---
Says more about yours that you're so upset
---
&gt;  coming from a guy who has a bachelor‚Äôs in finance. 
---
Coming from a guy who hasn't gotten one yet. He's still in the middle of doing it.
---
I'd even be careful of some of the other sources you've listed as a relevant source. Specifically player experiences. Remember the 900 hrs guy that was supposedly innocently banned whose story did the rounds with games media? His story was found to be implausible and VERY likely that he was duping ammo.
---
The only sources I would trust are reputable people from reputable institutions and hard evidence, like the game data as you alluded to. I wouldn't even believe the interpretations of Bethesda's PR statements because you'd have to assume that they're telling the truth and they've proven time and again to not be a reliable source of truth. They directly lied about the Atom Store being cosmetics only and they've been misleading most recently about how the utility items being sold in the Atom Store was due the community's feedback.
---
It is true tho, and why does the queen never drop a 3*?
---
I lived most of my life in West Virginia and Fallout is my favorite game series. I genuinely wanted this game despite what most of the fanbase was saying. But I've been beaten down at every turn to the point where playing the game just feels wrong. It's like an intentional sabotage and I don't understand why.
---
So you can pay money, and it makes your game easier. You can store more legendaries in your stash, and keep them even if you are past your scrip limit for the day because you have more stash room. You don't have to spend time managing your scrap because you can store infinite amounts of it! You get a second fast travel location, which saves you caps (lots if you plan ahead and strategize) so you can buy more serum plans to make more caps or buy legendaries from other players, which helps you kill things more effectively! It's all advantage! 
---
And maybe next month, you can pay 20 for unlimited ammo! What a deal! just try it, you'll like it! And the month after you can pay $10 per mod for shotgun mods that make your shotgun use 8 gauge shells and do more damage! Try it! you'll love it! 
---
Of course if you try it you'll like it. That's why you have to pay for it.  Just pay for convenience and everything will be better! 
---
Or, take a stand, and don't pay for something that exploits the goodwill of the community. Not because you wouldn't like it, but because it's WRONG. 
---
People aren't protesting because the things that you can pay for aren't useful. If they weren't useful people wouldn't pay for them (I mean, unless by useful you mean looking cool like cosmetics). People are protesting because while they were skeptical of an online fallout, they purchased it because they were promised things would remain free other than cosmetics, and that promise has been trampled on. It's wrong.
---
That‚Äôs good but will it keep you THAT is the challenge in a great game in my experience.
---
I‚Äôve played so many games that are fun out of the gate and lack playability and longevity.
---
Hey I hope you love it ....... I hope you can trot back here and rub it in everyone‚Äôs face, but this isn‚Äôt the forum for it in my opinion.
---
If you want to roll on so be it.....Beth keeps track of users and shop purchases to know if a game is healthy and has interest.  No need in stating on any game forum that you‚Äôre announcing your departure....that you‚Äôre uninstalling a game.....like anyone knows who you are.
---
It‚Äôs text book sociopath and narcissistic behavior and just looks childish.
---
Good day
---
Yea I think maybe they need to beef up the servers they use! Obviously their servers can‚Äôt handle the amount of information being processed.
---
&gt;The majority of this subreddit is going all out against fallout first. However playing the game, everyone i see has the ncr outfit.
---
Yes. Because pretty much only the people who have proven they will tolerate shit like this are still playing the game. If you see someone in-game it's very probably that they aren't the ones shitting on BGS and fallout 76. We have all long since abandoned the game.
---
The posts people have made thus far have not been in the context of Fallout 76 beyond "I'm quitting this game for TOW" and that's not sufficiently related to Fallout 76 to be allowed.
---
You are free to doubt, still I did.
---
Not telling you what to do but for now on record anything you do. When joining a world, record it, and go to a populated area filled with mobs. If there's goo piles, corpses, ashes, meat piles, scrap piles, that means it's not fresh that's your ammunition against Bethesda's claims. Because obviously the instanced loot crates and all.
---
Or followed Extra Credit's advice:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXA559KNopI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXA559KNopI) 
---
* Plan your monetization strategy early
---
* Players are content. 
---
* Don't split your player base. 
---
* Never sell power.
---
Sounds like the best solution.
---
 **Poe's law** is an [adage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adage) of [Internet culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_culture) stating that, without a clear indicator of the author's intent, it is impossible to create a [parody](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody) of [extreme views](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extremism) so obviously exaggerated that it cannot be mistaken by some readers for a sincere expression of the views being parodied
---
Finally there is a god!
---
I don't think you can cite capitalism, which has voting with your wallet built into its foundations, as being a reason to not criticize people who voted for this with their wallet.
---
More posts like this would be great.  If nothing else but to drown out the outrage movements of people who aren't actually invested in the game at all.  
---
Agree with all your points.
---
ESO is a functional MMO with tons of content and frequent updates. It's a far cry from the same thing.
---
I have it
---
I'm not sure what you are trying to say.
---
No no no 1510 Atoms. You get 1500 "free" so they gotta stay onto you.
---
skyrim together wasn't really free, iirc the only release was stuck behind a paywall (not sure if it has been released since then).
---
It was in an interview as well. And you have to admit what he said is not true anymore. 
---
Here is the quote:        ‚ÄúAll the content we ever put out for Fallout 76,‚Äù explains Hines; ‚Äúall the DLC, all the post-launch stuff, is going to be free. That‚Äôs important. And to say, the Atomic Shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand. Look, there‚Äôs a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we‚Äôre going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you‚Äôre getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I‚Äôm getting that stuff for free. That feels right.‚Äù
---
Then don't get fallout 1st if you don't think it's worth it, if you played since BETA and you enjoy it for what it is the good on ya, there's people on here that buys 1st and bitches about it after getting it, frankly as I said before I could really care less as long as I get to enjoy a fallout game I'm all for it I don't have to waste money on this game and still have fun playing it, it's buggy sure it can be cruel sometimes yeah but when people grief outta fun, stealing and destroying other people's hard earned things it can be difficult at times with all the OP legacy weapons the pvp tryhard imposter sheepsquatch outfits and the groups that camp at whitesprings just to get people to pvp, I'm gonna enjoy this game for what it is and all the toxicity within this hateful community can't change my spirits otherwise
---
First of all, this isnt just pointed at you, but bethesda doesn't need to add more things to 1st, it needs to fix the problems its having and get their game straight, they've already lied to us multiple times so I dont think they need to add new things until they fix earlier mistakes
---
Most people I know arent getting the private servers to play "single player" - we're getting them to play multiplayer with our friends only with significantly less lag than public servers.
---
I don't think anyone has ever been under any illusion this game is anything but multiplayer focused.
---
tfw the hotfix comes in too hot
---
Totally agree. The scrap box is a great manifestation of the "pay2win" philosophy. Fortnite goes absolutely well without changing a byte on this.
---
Since this is not /r/fnv, it's relation to FNV does not help the cause of those who wish to post about it.
---
I don‚Äôt know man. Wish they‚Äôd moderate these posts. They‚Äôre everywhere and are exhausting. We don‚Äôt need to hear everyones sob story about a game. Feel free to give Bethesda feedback on their feedback page. When the hell did everyone get so damn entitled and soft?
---
Because it had v little content. Those first days of release were awful. But the game has improved enough that I was happy to buy a subscription to continue seeing it improve. It would have eventually even still, but I feel like I'm "rewarding" Bethesda by shelling out a few bucks lol
---
Most people that hate new fallout 1st subscription doesn't play fo76 at all.
---
True, I fixed several things in my post.
---
I hate that we as consumers have to be put into a situation where we can‚Äôt trust a majority of what the company we bought from is saying. 
---
I get money should do the talking but I feel as consumers get more involved, aiming for a positive customer experience will be what brings in the meaningful income rather than aggressive monetization.
---
Everything else aside, I like your username.
---
The d20 has 1s on all sides.
---
Some people are reporting that its still happening
---
Nothing BGS does to fallout 76 will affect my gameplay. I don't even have the BGS launcher installed anymore.
---
How's it my ammo when  I just joined the world and saw the corpses once and is the first time going to said location on that day?
---
Tell that to the folks who have made Rule 1 violating posts trying to talk about it.
---
Yeah level caps blow for a private world
---
If Bethesda was getting even a majority of the millions that they‚Äôre raking in from atom store and now this subscription, Wastelanders wouldn‚Äôt have been delayed, we would have had more content added between launch and now, it‚Äôs obvious a skeleton crew is working on 76 and not a lot of money is going into its development. So while I don‚Äôt have their financial documents bc they are not publicly traded, it‚Äôs obvious that there is very little investment going into supporting this game, combine that with Zenimax being in extreme debt to providence and there‚Äôs really only 1 logical conclusion. 
---
Horse armor occurred in oblivion, they got spammed and went through fallout 3 and Skyrim without issues, just normal expansion packs which I never minded paying for. The monetization in 76 alone has escalated more than it did in the entire time from Morrowind to Fallout 4. Look you don‚Äôt have to accept it, but you sure as shit can‚Äôt say I haven‚Äôt put any thought into reaching these conclusions. And the reason I‚Äôm outspoken about is because I‚Äôm sick of dealing with this bullshit in games, the idiotic behavior of the uninformed masses is negatively affecting me and Id rather it didn‚Äôt lol that simple.
---
Maybe I have magic rng powers? :P I'd be pretty happy lol
---
Just joking around but yeah she does for me, not every time, or anywhere close, but she does drop them
---
If you're really not getting any I do feel your pain, but I think it must be some crazy rng bs or something
---
What's your luck level? I've often wondered if it effected stuff like that but I've never had enough data to track it, mine is 15
---
Yeah. Is it really that hard to do it the Minecraft way? Release the serverfiles and everyone is happy. And for those who aren't tech savy enough or don't have a way to host themselves, they can offer it for a few bucks a month like Minecraft Realms.
---
Bethesda does not accuse players of lying as suggested by your sensationalist headline. 
---
The playerbase is ignorant. They do not understand how the world loot system works. The game remembers the last x-hundred items you have picked up in the world, puts them on a list, and will not respawn them until you pick up enough new stuff to bump the old stuff off the list. This was done to prevent server hoping to farm a single spot.
---
You are being downvoted because you are the one lying and trying to drum up more hate.
---
I got so angry I uninstalled the launcher.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty easy, just don‚Äôt get the subscription. Not getting it doesn‚Äôt actually change your gameplay experience at all
---
Fun fact, in many states compulsory TOS are non-binding... Like California, where the initial class action lawsuit was held. I'm also not asking for a refund, with over 100 hours in the game i got my valuation out of it. My close friend on the other hand was denied a refund yesterday with less than 2 hours of playtime. Guess where he lives? California.
---
I agree there is multiplayer designed content, I'm aware of it.  But there is more than enough content to do solo (or, if nothing else to farm stuff so I can do the multiplayer content) that I can just do that... then jump back over to the public servers to do the event.
---
Or, you know, I can get people to come to my personal server to do the multiplayer content there without having anyone else there to cause problems. 
---
And the tent isn't useless - sure the fast travel cost isn't needed, but it is a nice convenience to have a place you can drop things off - refresh your XP buff, AP buff, and cook up food. Which is why I wouldn't say it's P2W - it's just a convenience item. 
---
But no loss on my side so I have no anger anyways.
---
armor got updates at one point as well. weapon, junk, or aid weight reduction, disease resistance, lock pick etc
---
Yup, definitely will agree with your over-the-top left field example being compared to a game subscription
---
Second worst
---
Paying $100 a yeae for a shared universal server that can hold even less than a third of the original server size though. 8 people is outrageously small and might speak moreso for server stability rather than fun game mechanics.
---
I'm not being lied to, I knew this would eventually happen I knew it wouldn't be "cosmetics only" before long I just chosen not to spend my money on this game like you might have and hey look who's whining about "Bethesda's word"
---
Oh ok you don‚Äôt even play anymore and have a problem with them fixing bugs lol
---
Thank you!  I created it as a seperate account to help with planning my proposal to my husband (we got engaged at Wizarding World and I didn't want him to stumble across my posts!).  After all was said and done I decided I liked it so I might as well make it my main üòÑ
---
This. All businesses end up at this "bottom line, bottom of the barrel" point. We've just been fortunate for most of our childhood/teenage/young adult years to see an industry that was in its developing stages. Developers had to try to make something really good to sell to an audience, there was an arms race to reach 3d tech, then online multiplayer, and we as consumers benefited from that competition. Now gaming is an established industry- by some metrics bigger than hollywood and certain sports franchises- so now we get to see the "too big to fail" side of it. Keep your expectations low for the forseeable future.
---
Bethesda enablers get the back lash too.
---
May all your 3* bestow upon you good 3* legendaries
---
The truth is...
---
The game was rigged from the start...
---
You do realize that an influx of negativity like this means something is wrong right?  
---
They are not asking for socialism, they are asking for a company to not scam its only source of revenue to the point all of them quit at once. Notice how the servers are fucking dead sense the update, yeah guess why.
---
Like most equipment items I pick up are like 130% durability because of high luck
---
Just post it.  There's no reason to hold off.
---
Oh I didn't reply to this :(. Yeah it is! Add me and I'll see ya soon man
---
Yeah, if 76 was more compressed in terms of map size and didn't have Events, it would be comparable to Nuka World and Far Harbor in terms of content.
---
It was just the wrong way to go about making a Multiplayer Fallout Experience.
---
Elder Scrolls Online is a shining example of how to take a single player franchise and make a fantastic multiplayer experience out of it. The crazy thing is that both F76 and ESO are basically from the same company!
---
I actually like weightless junk, i don't have use for it but I'm addicted to picking up all the junk and now i can do it and watch numbers in scrap box go up :)
---
\*sad look on radroach\*I'm not allowed in?
---
"Fallout 76 isn't and was never designed to be a single player game from the start"
---
 No shit Sherlock!
---
You are correct
---
You can sue for a lot of things, it doesn't mean you will win.
---
Same here, but never a 3*
---
Oh shoot, really? I guess with the blizzard and FO1st stuff going on right now too I didn't look into that as much as I should have, I'll research it more myself later. Thanks for letting me know though!
---
According to the info, you keep the cosmetics and clothing but loose the ability to add to your scrap box... also your private server is removed..
---
Exactly! If you have a problem with such things then don't bother getting it, you won't have a reason to complain in the first place, am I right lads or am I right lads "you are right lad" cheers lad
---
I play on an XBox One and I don't have the issues other people rant and rave about.
---
I also play (way less frequently) on a PC that's six years old.  It runs less smoothly there, admittedly, but still nothing compared to some of the posts I read.
---
Are you still here?
---
That's awesome. Thanks for pointing that out.
---
An issue with them selling convenience/relief items is that they are also the ones that control how convenient things are, so they have a financial incentive to make things incontinent to drive you towards buying the relief items. So even if you don't buy them the game design is still warped to accommodate them.
---
They are creating the problems and selling you the solutions to put it another way.
---
Its mostly just a tech demo at this point. That being said, I have a 35$ ship, have only spent the minimum 45$ for the game, and am already very satisfied with the rapid changes I have seen over the last year or so since I bought in. 
---
Something else to point out, Star citizen has only had around 500 devs concurrently for a year, 350 the year prior, less than 150 every year before that. CIG also recently received yet another $46 milliion in funding, not from fans, but from an outside investment firm. In addition, CIG has one of the lowest dev-month costs in the industry, at $6000/head. This is essentially the cost each month for individual developers. To put that into perspective, GTA V had a dev-month cost of $10,000 for 5 years straight, with over 1000 developers working concurrently for nearly 7 years. Granted, that game sold great, but still. 
---
CIG also has a resale value, even if they never manage to produce a game. The current valuation is close to $500 million. Most people don't realize that they are not just making a game, but dev-tools for procedural generation as well that retain resale value after Squadron 42 and the PU are finished.
---
Mobile Game 76
---
And if it's a 3* its usually lvl 10 out of a max level enemy
---
Yes you can cancel anytime. After you cancel you can't put stuff into the scrap box anymore but you can still pull everything out of it.
---
Okay man see ya soon
---
Which needs to be fixed a day after release because they would rather rush to release their money grab than to test to make sure it's  ready first.  Which is exactly my argument.
---
 You use the word 'karma' so do you believe everyone gets what they deserve?
---
The best is /r/fallout and how they consistently have the same recycled conversation (NV good 76 bad) over and over and over and over, with most of them never playing 76 to begin with. How can some people put so much time and emotional energy into hating something? Some of those nerds put enough hours into hating the game, that they'd probably reach lvl 50 in game with all of that time spent bitching.
---
You keep everything except the ability to store more in the scrap box. So if you go crazy in the first month you may never need scrap again lol you can always access what you stored after.
---
You'd think so but I still see people complaining rhey canxt play by themselves. If it costs a fool $12 to realize they're wrong, at least something of value was learned
---
Yes, I do. Everything included to the Fo1st membership is no different to me than when I see someone with the Slasher costume. It doesn't affect my gameplay at all. I can still play every quest, access every building, get every weapon item, armor. And with everything in the atom shop being free. I'm not mad that this is only the second time anything in-game actually costs money. (again, I do think outfits and emotes should be in the atom shop. But other people having little utility perks don't change my game at all)
---
Anything in the box is still accessible after your subscription expires but you can not deposit into the box. 
---
Hope that helps :)
---
Its F baffeling that people Pay for this shit. Its fuxking insane. 
---
A company that lies left right and centern and people still Pay.
---
I paid an hours pay to to collect as much junk as possible to use after my one month ends. 
---
Pretty nifty move if I must say so. 
---
I paid an hours pay to run a few nukes zones with a few of my fiends. 
---
That‚Äôs multiplayer right? 
---
Also, I‚Äôll have you know, I intend to wear my ranger outfit until they turn off the servers for good ;)
---
If you don't mind, what led you to continue backing the game until this point?
---
Oh you're not the one that's quitting the game? Got you confused with that enclave guy up there. Nah I'm not gonna extort a fellow vault dweller, but much appreciated
---
OH hey everybody my PSN is same as it is here. I'm the only Flooping_pigs. See ya there
---
in general, enemies should scale in multiplayer too, the lvl zones are shit or at least give us players the option
---
It takes about 7 days after an update to return to regular posts.
---
I think that subscribing for a month every once in a while (or even just once) is a very reasonable idea.  Because they've said you can still pull scrap out of your scrap box (but not put more in), you can go nuts saving scrap during sub months, and the rest of the time just enjoy that you've got a lot of the F1st benefits without paying all the time!
---
Those pumpkins look straight out of a PS2 game.
---
I mean, I was honestly expecting the servers to be $15 a month and for that to be it - no extra benefits, no yearly discount.  And I only have like 2 other people I ever play with ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  8 people to me sounds like too many üòÇ
---
We each find different value in things I suppose.
---
I never once said I was going to purchase Fallout 1st, because I do think it's a scam.
---
I also clearly stated I still enjoy it to this day, and plan on getting my money's worth out of it.
---
I'm just fed up with corporate greed and Bethesda as a company clearly attempting to take advantage of it's consumers and loyal fans.
---
This post was meant as a word of warning, and I'm not entirely sure where the disconnect is, unless you failed to thoroughly read my comment.
---
Bad troll.
---
You just said on r/gaming: "I'm pretty sure Bethesda doesn't care about Fallout either and I'm fully convinced this is them saying "wow guess nobody likes Fallout anymore???" 
---
I love Fallout and will miss it dearly"
---
Same here dog, brace for the hate messages but don‚Äôt worry about those assholes lol.
---
You would've been better off burning the money. Really.
---
Yeah that's very strange then
---
How so?  BGS has said outright they're running on AWS.
---
Bethesda: "It's my MONEY AND I NEED IT NOW!"
---
&gt; **Fallout 76 seems as profit-oriented and careless as the corporations it maligns in its in-game text.‚Äù** 
---
Just like most of these "newspapers" and "YouTubers".
---
If you get this mad over a video game it might be a healthier choice for you to find something else you enjoy in life and put this title down for a bit.
---
Charisma and luck are at 15, still no 3*
---
Toxicity is often necessary for cleaning out an infection. BGS is going to continue making shit games as long as people keep defending their shit decisions.
---
If they had given us the game we wanted in the first place instead of this MTX ridden fuckhole of a failure we would have bought it hand over fist. Bethesda made their bed when they decided to make 76 an MMO and fluffed the pillows when they started adding MTX.
---
Its high time they sleep in that bed.
---
You'd be a fool for supporting something so lambastic and cop out which is in a dry spell till the next content drops. The halloween event is only, what, a week long? Is renting a servwr for that event even worth it?
---
Most of the people here defended Bethesda's through thick and think. They are legit low iq.
---
You are being far more rude than anything I said.
---
Eventually I'll put the game down if it gets to the point of no return but until then I still won't spend any money on the game, you might or not who knows
---
I made that point and was abused for it... I didn‚Äôt word it in exactly the same way as you. But you are bang on with the servers point!
---
It's a survival game.. I like to strugle üòé
---
You gotta wonder how much of a difference Fallout Shelter's revenue from monetization is to 76's. Like with Shelter, the lunchboxes were purely optional and you could easily get them, and Fallout Shelter as an app was a fun and solid experience and was downloaded like a lot. 76 on the other hand, it is harder to gain atoms and the monetization currency, it was released with a metric asston of bugs and embarrassment for Bethesda. And now you've got a premium subscription service for A GAME THAT WE PAID 30-300 dollars for. Like the subscription fee is roughly the same price (if not more) Fallout New Vegas is on Steam (actually right now its on sale for 3 DOLLARS). Like I know a lot of people who still play Shelter, while I barely know more than a handful of people who still play 76 (myself included).
---
We might be idiotic nerds, but at least we can afford a monthly sub.
---
You'll realize doing the bigger events with only 2 people will become quite the chore.
---
Go out and get some air.
---
They could just make the game better to make money.
---
Look, I get it, I'm a Fallout Fanboy also, I play 76, but if you list all the 'scandals' that have happened in connection to Fallout 76, from Todd Howard making promises he didn't (and possibly didn't have an intention to) keep to the snafu with the collector's editions, the prices in the Atom Shop, SELLING repair kits, absurd, game breaking bugs that caused people to be so frustrated that they set the game down for months or just quit, data breaches, the $80 bottle of Nuka-Rum that was a plastic shell around a normal bottle, and then, to add insult to injury, their HANDLING of ALL of these issues being absolutely amateur and disingenuous - I can see why people feel the way they feel.
---
Bethesda is one of the most beloved gaming studios out there - or at least they were - until their handling of Fallout 76, which let down fans in so many ways it's hard to count.  They could have done better from the start, but instead they continually send their loyal fanbase the message that they're just going to keep trying to scam them with sub-par add-ons and special products as money grabs - they're telling them that all the fans are to Bethesda is a way to inch out another dime.
---
If you want to make more money, fix your issues, stop treating your loyal players like crap, be honest, and add quality things to the game that are worth paying for.  Coming out and apologizing for something and then turning around and doing essentially the exact same thing causes you to lose goodwill fast, and that's sad, because they took me from someone who would hands-down preorder any fallout product to someone who simply doesn't trust them.
---
Ya'll go ahead and vote this down, but it represents the feelings of a large portion of Fallout fans.  And this is coming from a life-long, die hard fan who wants Bethesda to succeed and wants their games to be great.  And part of the reason that people freak out over things that aren't even that bad is the intentional approach to other things that kill the community's goodwill toward the company - they've made their own bed here, they need to take action if they truly want to fix it.
---
That's one pill I'm not prepared to swallow yet - that being resistant to microtransactions and the current business model of Bethesda dates you and makes you an irrational old man if you don't just accept it. 
---
I'll yell at the kids to get off my damn lawn until my face is blue in that regard, because if you yell loudly enough, they usually do. ;)
---
Though the demand can and is artificially generated by the gaming company in order to then supply you for some extra money.
---
I can not stress this enough, all the bad things like limited inventory space and such are design choice, artificially made and can be adjusted by any given time just by modifying 1 line in a code.
---
Also unlike in real life, gaming company has a monopoly on stuff that has demand.
---
Typical toxic player insulting everyone
---
I would never bully or harass you, but you deserve ridicule.
---
I as well call bullshit to this claim, I played last night and encountered 3 3* enemies and they all dropped 3* items. No where did they promise 3* enemies will always drop a 3* item.
---
I clicked the link and my adblock extension blocked 300 ads. Polygon has become an absolutely disgusting monster
---
Silver lining is maybe this will filter out all the dumbasses in the player base.  Then again I doubt very much the people complaining actually play the game.
---
I think perhaps what you really mean here is that the multi-billion dollar game developer is unwilling to put money into making the game better, including perhaps hiring more and more experienced developers or paying the ones working on it what they're actually worth.  I THINK what you mean is that the company that makes an absurd amount of money every time they release the game is more concerned with that extra small amount of profit going into the right pockets (shareholders?) than it is actually developing their game.  No one has ill-will toward the actual developers, but the company itself is putting profits WAY over quality, which is not the Bethesda we knew in the past.
---
And before we go there, yes, I know how a business works, I've run one for 20 years - you have a choice to maximize profits, maximize quality, or fall somewhere in between.  They're not going to go bankrupt if they spend more money to make a quality product - they just might have a few shareholders who can't take that third vacation to Italy this quarter.
---
oh wait this is fallout not a dating site
---
I paid about 40 for 2/3rds of a game, played about 7-8 hours of it, uninstalled it, went back to 4. Havent reinstalled it yet, waiting on them to give me what they should have given me all the way back at e3.
---
And until then my dollars go....primarily to Horizon Hobby, actually. Rather buy rc airplanes instead of 76 shit.
---
They are trying to farm karma points
---
&gt; A lot of people paid for it 
---
Because this subreddit cannot realize it is just a tiny fraction of the actual player base. Half of the people around here talk as if they are entitled to speak up for all of us, when they can barely speak up for themselves, when it happens that they can actually speak decently.
---
Leave your basement time to time
---
I really enjoy the idea of adding more unique named items, as those were my favorite hoarded treasures from this and other games. Making unique clothing, weapons and gear that is mission based (not atom shopped) to hunt daily gives people continued reason to play.
---
My stance is, if toy don‚Äôt like it, ignore it... If you like it buy it. The game is the same as it was before the patch in the respect of the fallout 1st part... just pretend its not there!!
---
Fuck, I just lost The Game
---
I already have played most of the content solo since launch.  Very little of it can't be done solo.
---
I guess I'm a fool for doing the impossible.
---
Want attention like little bitches
---
I did the year lol. Course my Xbox account got hacked last night, so I‚Äôm down till Microsoft can recover my account. Ugh.
---
I'm talking multiplayer events like the vault (thats already an issue), the scorchqueen without bloodied loadouts, fausnacht event that takes about 20 min with a soldi team, and pther labor intensive events. Normal events are fine, I'm talking events that require quantity due to how the mechanics are designed.
---
üëèüëèüëèüëè
---
If you can‚Äôt afford 8 dollars a month for a video game.  You can not afford my wife or anyone elses.  :)
---
Sure.
---
No they have terrible PR and it contributes greatly towards everyone hating them.
---
Surprised they didn‚Äôt charge you for seeing it
---
Don't have a reasonable response so you resort to ad hominem?  Classy.
---
Lol you think you're important.
---
I see your point. Maybe the mechanic only works if you are actively aligned to the respective faction.
---
Salty bitch lol
---
No, not moonwalk. He fucking jetpacked over the line.
---
If someone else has not I always pop a tent at SQB events.
---
Yup!! Let us earn them in game!!
---
Capitalism isn‚Äôt a democracy where every person is valued equally, I‚Äôm sorry to tell you. 
---
When 20% of the player base sucks off Bethesda and pays for cosmetics in a game that has a lot of fundamental issues, and 80% ‚Äúvote with their wallet,‚Äù it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs unpopular. It matters if it‚Äôs profitable.
---
Makes sense . I'll keep this in mind
---
No they are part of the problem
---
 Stop defending bethesda
---
Pretty sure I can sink the entire company with a single reddit post, yeah
---
Yip and it is taking so long. This maintenance has basically ruined my Friday night gaming night...
---
Internet points.
---
Really? Hmm I didn‚Äôt seem to have that problem. I kind of equate them with Kotaku or more of a middle of the road publication.
---
But why?
---
You should set up an appointment with a brain dealer.
---
They need to make a "Scrapomatic" type device that can sit there and only scrap, like a workbench, without the other workbench features.
---
People want attention.
---
Sorry for the miscommunication!
---
Yeah iam sorry i want to farm a nuke on ws without a whole server fighting to kill the ghouls
---
Thank you!! Any ideas you'd like to add??
---
Answer: totally deserve it. Who hasnxt learned to wait to try nee things ecer since the Vault fiasco? See ya useless cloth.
---
The cost of an actual private server with 0 online? The same, or less than it cost to develop 'private servers' as they are now, minus server upkeep.
---
Yes but I don‚Äôt have a source. Something clarifying what private servers are exactly (shard, dedicated server, whatever), that they‚Äôre looking into the scrap box issue and a few other things.
---
As long as it‚Äôs not online I‚Äôll be buying the next game
---
Right!
---
By purchasing Fallout 76 or any of its content, you are supporting their awful practices.
---
You are, with your wallet, making the gaming landscape TERRIBLE.
---
This is a protest and you're playing for the wrong team.
---
No worries,  nothing to apologise for.
---
The subscription service deserves being upset about. Price would be understandable if those private worlds included options to change things up a bit like make it survival, but to many they are just a money grab and a sign that when Mods come that they too will be behind a paywall.
---
After you uninstall
---
 "Turn off your computer and make sure it powers down
---
Then burn all the clothes you may have worn any time you were on-line!"
---
No, its more so the inorganic influx of people defending Bethesda and the obvious vote manipulation.
---
I‚Äôm asking for socialism but that‚Äôs unrelated lmao
---
It's just maintenance. 
---
https://bethesda.net/status
---
Adding you now!
---
What do they get for them anyway? A full plate set at the end of the year?
---
Jet pack glitch. It‚Äôs been 2 months.
---
Surely OP means the positivity when, during Beta, this sub just a huge cluster of glitches, crashes, hackers, and lack of meeting expectations and the resultant freak-outs when people tried to return the game and Bethesda blocked refunds. /s
---
I think allowing higher level players to nuke new areas could help with increasing difficulty.
---
Why did I buy the year, or why did I get hacked?
---
No worries. I wanna find people to run them with fairly consistently, so whether we'd team up today, tomorrow or in a few days, as long as we get raiding, I'm a happy camper! Adding you now :)
---
They certainly are fearmongering and assumptive, but that's no reason to dismiss them outright on the basis of being a slippery slope argument. I think it's always important to define what the slope/grease is, then go from there.
---
Yeah, me too.  I'd never done the Queen before last night because I didnt want to get in the way of other players.
---
It was a bitch, but my husband and I managed it with some creative base building.  Minimal lag probably helped a ton. Finally actually finished the story content after a year of playing.  I just refused to go anywhere nearby before.
---
Havent tried Fausnacht or the vault though... but I was never ever going to do them on a public server anyway so if I cant do them on private it doesnt sound like too big of a loss.
---
I enjoyed playing the game.  The latest changes don‚Äôt effect the gameplay (in my opinion).   
---
Be well fellow Wastelander
---
How many times have they lied? How can we trust them?
---
The people in this sub buy anything they sell no matter what, this if your fault for your shameless consumerism and lack of taste and or standards.....
---
This.  This right here.  It‚Äôs not the factor that they‚Äôre charging for a premium subscription.  It‚Äôs the fact that they are putting aspects into the game that show what they‚Äôve said before is a lie.
---
The biggest one?  Storage space.  An infinite sized scrap box indicates clearly that storage space being limited for stability is a load.
---
That their claim of everything game changing would be free.
---
That modding would be a thing down the line.
---
This is in the end a big set of broken promises.  And a nail in the coffin.  This is not just anger in this game, this is a complete betrayal to long time BGS fans.  This makes any future release seem suspect
---
They're just karma farmin'.
---
No but it‚Äôll definitely impact initial sales and raise a lot of skepticism when they release the next fallout title.
---
Pretty sure Einstein has been proven to be correct multiple times
---
You can go crazy on your "private server" for a month hauling junk from every workshop there is on the map (They're never contended!), scrap the junk and place it in your box. You'll have resources and ammo (There's that ammo plant up north remember?) for a life time.
---
You can cancel your subscription whenever you like.
---
When time is up 
---
\- You'll keep your junk, the armor and other atom shop stuff
---
\- You'll not have a fast travel tent
---
\- You'll not be able to fill more junk in your trunk :D
---
\- You cannot create a private server - but still able to visit those who are created by your friends.
---
They should have just given us what we wanted all along. Nobody asked for an MMO. We wanted another proper sp fpsrpg, perhaps with the ability to join our friends in place of NPC companions, and we wanted the usual mod support we have enjoyed in Bethbryo games since pretty much day one.
---
If they had given us that we would have bought 76 in droves and it would not have been a flop at all. Honestly I could have looked past the whole 'hurr plague killed human npcs' aspect if it had otherwise been a normal Fallout game...
---
Cv xz xz.
---
They‚Äôre rage quitting, they want to try and bring people with them because they‚Äôre salty karma whores that think if a ton of people on Reddit give them sympathy their lives won‚Äôt be meaningless husks dripping of failure and self loathing. 
---
They live for hating things and 76 gives them reasons to shitpost. 
---
Meanwhile, I‚Äôll be enjoying my subscription and laughing as I have fun on the game I like.
---
So what?
---
Why did you buy the year? All together that's what 140 dollars? I'm not sure the game is worth that
---
That's what I've been thinking. I haven't lost my scrap at all, nor have I had the majority of problems people have talked about over time since the game came out. Only issues I ever have had were issues with the social menu not working right for teaming with friends, and my head disappearing when getting out of power armor. Both were just annoyances more than game breaking. But I'm still wondering why they didn't push to get the PTS out and going before doing the Private Servers. Seems to me that a PTS would have been something far better to invest in, and would have been a much larger boost of consumer good will than this cluster that came out after postponing Wastelanders.
---
No. Not only that but everyone has their own opinion of whats "good for the franchise". Do you remember when people lost their mind over FO4? Pepperidge Farm Remembers
---
The more karma points you have,the cooler you are I guess.
---
As far as I can tell it‚Äôs the other way around. For most people, their junk is gone completely.
---
Not sure why you're angry I'm leaving, it's a decision I made for myself. If you want to keep playing then go for it! I sincerely hope you enjoy the game and that you have a good time.
---
If you love it give it up for a time. Maybe you can have more reason to love it when it is not a big p2w macrotransaction.
---
&gt; Enjoy the game for what it is
---
The problem here is that "what the game is" in many people's minds has been radically altered by the news of this subscription service - and the game constantly reminds you of it.
---
Take, for instance, putting unlimited junk storage behind a paywall. Stash limits are a major annoyance in this game - people have been complaining about them since launch - and Bethesda's responses left the community with the impression these limits were in place primarily for performance reasons. But now we know differently: as a small portion of the community pointed out, it's basically the same thing to store 100,000 steel in a database as 1 steel. That restriction was only ever put in place so they could charge money to get around it later. To be clear: Bethesda introduced a game mechanic (finite scrap storage) that has no purpose except to frustrate the player to the point they will pay money to get around it.
---
When people bought the game, they didn't think they were signing up for that sort of experience (particularly since they charged $60 for the game, rather than making it free-to-play). So even though the game itself (in the sense of code and balance and the like) is essentially unchanged from a week ago, people's *perception* of it is now very different.
---
Basically, a week ago when people thought about picking up some steel and decided not to it was part of some weird technical constraint Bethesda had, and fit the mental model that "what it is" was a fun game that doesn't neatly fit into any single box of game genre and had a bunch of technical issues (which, in a lot of ways, is what *every* Bethesda title is like). Now when someone sees some steel and doesn't pick it up it's because Bethesda put that restriction in to make more money - which changes the mental model of the game to be one where Bethesda are trying to milk as much money from the consumer as possible even if that worsens the experience of people who have already paid $60 for it.
---
It's also worth noting that there have been so many screwups on Bethesda's part since E3 2018 that a lot of people who are pissed off by this have probably been defending the game for a *long* time - meaning there's probably an element of feeling personally betrayed.
---
&gt;  everyone
---
"I am the lorax, I speak for the trees!"
---
That u were told u would get for free . Ur either very naive or very gullible. Neither one being a good thing. I was a loyalist until they broke yet again another promise of saying nothing will be a pay for advantage things.  They strictly cosmetics smh. U had to be one of the dummies who actual paid money for Horse Armor üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I think people didnt like the game because they wanted it to be single player. People for years have been asking for fallout online from a company who almost NEVER does multiplayer games, and expected a game of the year. FO76 is great for who its coming from
---
It‚Äôs not single player as it‚Äôs still online and everything you do carries over to public servers.
---
You‚Äôre not wrong
---
Sorry, it just sounded like the notifications of the complaints and whining I get from this subreddit on a daily basics, the warnings seem true and they may be, I just see it as an enjoyable game and I don't read up on the drama and backlash people cause on the subreddit here to begin with, I'll enjoy this game until the day it enters a point of no return and drop playing this game, for now it's an opportunity to get on and actually be able to get the hard to find collectables such as magazines, bobbleheads and rare blueprints while the player count is low and thanks to fallout first all the shitebucket players level 250+ yeah all  those level 300+ "fallout 76 is life there's nothing to do but this thankfully I have my shitebucket  right here" have their own little private servers it's a opportune time to get what we normally couldn't get
---
That depends doesn't it? Games like Destiny 2 (now over 2 years old) has as high as ever player numbers and roadmap.
---
there ya go!
---
I got FF and there seems to be no lag for me if anything it's the opposite and everything seems more snappy and responsive . I havent run into the disapearing stash issue nor the used world were everything's dead and picked clean prior to me getting there . 
---
(not saying they arent happening just that in my extensive play I havent encountered them ) 
---
I'm does feel like a different playstyle since I'm now grabbing everything not nailed down and scrapping it instead of having to balance my scrap box ( and it obviously made more space for legendarys in my loot box ) 
---
also Monstermash the pvp event is a very enjoyable farming event on a private server as ghouls rush to their death and during the 3 rounds you see at least 1 legendary a round .
---
so far I'm rather happy with my purchase
---
&gt;  I'm enjoying the shit out of Borderlands right now and plenty of other games from publishers that aren't trying to nickel and dime me in exchange for nothing.
---
you lost all credibility when you mentioned borderlands
---
ESO's launch didn't affect people's opinions on FO4 though
---
The base game for 76 nets you free access to DLC, in game currency, and doubled day 1 stash size.
---
It's only laughable because BGS gave us this stuff for free to begin with.
---
*amoeba*
---
cheers for the question and answers, might buy a month subscription as well and see how it is
---
IT is worth it
---
I was just gonna say this, too. YOU DESERVE IT!!!!1!1!1

" We understand this is not what players expected for their Private Worlds and we are looking to provide an option in an upcoming patch that will allow Fallout 1st members to restrict access to their servers more completely, preventing friends from joining without permission."
---
Bro, their manservant‚Äôs kids got ponies. Ponies are for the poors. These kids must have an aquarium full of bonsai-style mini whales.
---
Best tip would be better play The Outer Worlds
---
All the more reason to me majorly disappointed with 76 and bop Pete over the head with it. 
---
Oh well. I'll stick to model aircraft instead. Might do a Vault Tec livery on the aerobat I'm building soon, as if it was something VT flew at airshows to drum up Vault slot sales. I may hate 76 and everything it represents but I love the franchise itself and am not gonna swear it off over *one* failed game. 
---
Now, if they also fuck up Fallout 5 I'm done with the series as a whole. They fuck that one up and, far as I'm concerned, 4 is the final entry in the Fallout story.
---
I still play and enjoy 76. In fact, my circle of dedicated player friends has been growing after losing most of my original friends in the months after launch.
---
Im not too gung ho about the atoms and skins etc. but am very exited about where private servers will take the game.
---
Private servers have been working great for us so far and chipping in $8.25/month (in lieu of micro transactions) I‚Äôm worth it for me.
---
oof
---
I‚Äôm right there with you man I invest because I want this game to succeed people call me a whale and all that but it‚Äôs my hard earned money and I shouldn‚Äôt be condemned for it.
---
It‚Äôs going to take an influx of revenue to pull this title out or we‚Äôll be stuck with what we have until they pull the plug.
---
I work in software with a company that has 50 + products and each product is evaluated and resources granted or removed depending on success and other things. 
---
I know it‚Äôs sucks the days of game companies just creating a game without profit for the shareholders in mind is long gone.  It is what it is....this is the reality.
---
Did you sue mommy and daddy when you found out there was no Santa Claus oops I‚Äôm sorry you might still believe
---
hadn't even thought of vault raids , will need to drag Shia to a private server to try out raids again
---
What exactly can go in the scrap box?
---
Is it anything categorized as junk or more specific?
---
I'm not defending it. Just saying calling a PR person a sellout is a bit ridiculous. Pete probably believed what he was saying was true because that's where the company was at during that quarter. The company makes different decisions down the road and bam, sorry Pete, you look bad but we need more money.
---
 Nah, its not that hard. Did 3 Scorchbeasts at once the other day, I was bored. ;)
---
I'm really not trying to troll. I hope that it will be free, I'm not trying to advocate for it not being free. I am trying to ask serious questions. If you trust Bethesda, that's fine. I just disagree and don't think they are trustworthy.
---
Get rid of the atoms and drop it to 76 cents a month, or 20 bucks (and maybe 76 cents too, $20.76) for lifetime access. Would still make them a bunch of liars, but at least it wouldn't be such a kick in the head.
---
&gt; including me
---
And are you happy with it? Because you're commenting on people's post telling them people unhappy are idiots.
---
You don't seem to be having much fun.
---
Then don't get it? Paid privacy is common for otherwise multiplayer games. I've never had an extra cent to spend on Fo76 and I'm not mad that other people do.
---
Private servers were always going to be behind a paywall: [https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk](https://imgur.com/a/9ajMZQk)
---
I agree that the junk storage should be for everyone, unless there is a legit reason why it's not (for example, additional support from AWS costs money and the subscription helps cover that).
---
beyond that I think the subscription is a good value considering the atoms and the private server, the other stuff is just bonuses
---
Taken alone, the cost isn't too bad and in line with other instance/server rentals for other games. The issue is whether it's worth it for this game. 
---
The subscription currently is mostly being sold on perks and future features - currently there's no control or difference for private instances vs regular adventure mode.
---
So the current question 'what can I do with a private instance?' is just 'play alone', which I don't think holds much value for a lot of players, or not at the price.
---
'Play just with the friends I want' isn't even an answer at the moment because there's no control on who joins on you from your list.
---
IMO, it's risky. What happens when your membership ends and you move camp? Can you still place the scrapbox? I think you can only access it but once you move camp your scrapbox is gone and also all your scrap.
---
First if all it's no "sense" forgot the e in your toxicity response, and second just pointing it out that everyday on the subreddit it's just complaint after complaint with this community, they could add pay to win weapons for all I care I'll play this game for the benefit of enjoying something not coming onto this place daily and complain about how "I get fucked by some company for spending cash on their games" you paid for the in game items pal your fault, not defending Bethesda I care less of what they do and how they do it
---
I have. I'm not trying to compare anything, and it is relevant to this sub because it's about all the drama that's going on with fallout first.
---
I'm personally really disappointed with the announcement, but you know what? I've gotten 600 hours out of Fo76, far more than most games.
---
There are other good games out, that's all. If Fo76 gets better then great, if it doesn't there's no reason to be upset because there's plenty of new stuff to enjoy.
---
I guess but a stupid Frid now with the 19,800 friggin atoms you will now have....
---
I do not think they addressed that, but I would guess it goes away.
---
You're way too late for that, Beth is not on the front lines of the the whole M.T. model that's been going for way longer, look at just about every other MMO out there, WoW, Eve, DC Online, Star Trek.  True, you vote with your wallet (which why I paid 20 bucks for the game) but to blame other players for voting with thier wallet for something you disagree with is childish.   Move on and just let other enjoy the game their way and you can enjoy hating on Beth for following industry standard, a standard that has been set since EA proved it was a viable model to everyone.
---
"Players are not losing their scrap by using the Scrapbox. Also, some players have lost their scrap by using the Scrapbox."
---
This company is chock full of complete imbeciles.
---
I can't figure what has people so mad.  I haven't had time to play much in awhile.  Is it just the private server subscriptions?  I am not getting it.
---
That's the part about this whole ordeal I can't understand.
---
How do you justify charging 150% more on top of the cost of the game and not include any real new content?
---
If this came with a massive DLC campaign I could kinda sorta justify it.
---
Cant understand why y'all even gave that game the time of day
---
If I rented a server from AWS for ~$100 / year and it reset and kicked everyone off every time I disconnected, I'd be pissed about that too.
---
&gt; The 13 bucks is per month, right? 
---
Yes. When you sign up, you will be charge the first 13 right then and there and your account will immediately go into 1st status. It states that you will not be charged again until the same day the following month.
---
&gt; Im not locked into anything? 
---
No. Cancelling is very, very simple. No pain or hassle. A simple click on the cancel button, and then a confirmation screen telling you when your last day of the current paid service will end, and then you click confirm, and thats it.
---
&gt; if i fill up a scrap box, and dont renew my subscription, do i lose it all? 
---
No. If you cancel your subscription, the 1st service will still be active until the day of the next charge date, aka, the day the service ends since you already paid for the first month. The scrap box itself will still permanently be present on your account and in game along with all items that was placed into it after the service has ended. After service has ended, you will be no longer be able to place any more items into the scrap box, but you will be able to take items out as you please.
---
&gt; Cause i might just scrap everything in sight for a month and then cancle it. 
---
This is exactly what I did. This system exist in other MMOs and i've done it there before too. Pay for the expanded stash, fill that shit up to the brim to free up space in main stash, cancel service, profit.
---
I've already cancelled the 1st service. I just wanted to experiment with the private server and take advantage of the scrap box to free up space in my stash. I freed up 500 weight units. got 300/800 in my stash. havent seen my stash not be full in like...............for ever.
---
Yeah just post it would make a welcome change and remind everyone why we came here in the first place
---
The irony of someone complaining about complainers is always hilarious.
---
No. I have a problem with people pretending that BGS working to make sure their latest cash grab works is in any way equivalent to them "fixing" anything. 
---
If BGS wanted to fix their game they would have had a proper beta. They would have focused of fixing the myriad bugs that still exist since launch instead of introducing features nobody asked for that bring additional bugs. They would have fixed the storage issues instead of releasing the "fix" as a new product you can pay for.
---
They aren't "fixing" anything. They are trying to make sure they can get ahead of the news that one of the two "features" that are part of this subscription doesn't even work right.
---
Everything besides bulk junk and harden mass
---
You kind of are since you are arguing when I provide the answer. It is going to be free. There is zero chance they charge. This has been asked at least 5 times today. They have been clear that wastelanders is free.
---
It does seem that they had the option of making money whilst also keeping people happy. Case in point was the fridge. They could have given everybody the basic one for free through a mission and then released 10 or so skins for it in the atom shop. I'm certain they would have had a tonne of sales plus a stupid amount of goodwill
---
I'd suggest  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2a6l6wM2k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B2a6l6wM2k) as their main menu music, tbf.
---
Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel (not to be confused with Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel)
---
Yeah I do, I could keep playing the game after it ended and my choices actually impacted the wasteland after I finished the story lol. The story wasn't as good but the amount of hours a game can give me in enjoyment decides if I buy it
---
1650 x 12 months... is 19,800 for a price of $100. 
---
Compare that against how many atoms you could buy for $100
---
$140? No it was 99.99 for a year. Break it down by month that‚Äôs 8.33 that alone is worth it in the atoms. 
---
I‚Äôm when I was playing in my own private world, it was nice to not be lagging so much.
---
The uninstall perk coupled with outer worlds install easy op build there's a great  Tutorial on YouTube
---
yeah , I'm grabbing the workshops mostly to build more camps and try out different camp designs . but now I dont need to worry about getting in the way of someone that legitimately needs that workshop .
---
Idk why everyone goes with the get a job insults lol. Like you cant have a job and play video games. Also that sub is way over priced for an already broken game. If you want to pay 100 dollars for the sub be my guest but you are the ones setting the standard for the industry
---
Yeah. It should've just been free and with a smaller radius so it doesn't run as big a risk of blocking other's camps.
---
‚ÄúDoes anyone truly expect that a company will be able to support a product without some incoming revenue?‚Äù - No, but the game was advertised as a one-time purchase of $60 with a cash shop. Now it has a premium membership too, which is completely unacceptable, especially considering the terrible state of the game.
---
Wait, TWO of us can play this game by ourselves?  I thought I was special because I was the only one in the world who could figure out how to play this multi-player game alone.
---
If there's more than me, then...OP must be a dumbass.  No, surely that can't be it.  There must be some other explanation!
---
How does Bethesda's boot taste op? Must taste pretty good considering how hard you're licking it.
---
Thank you for this, really wanted to see what they have for this event.  I hope the pumpkin stand only counts as 1 budget item, and not 12 for each individual piece.
---
I don't disagree it would be, just a shame at that price and with next to no new features
---
Nah, 76 is a nosedive in comparison to their former games by any measure. Even if you hated Fallout 4 it was still well received overall by critics and the fanbase at large, while 76 has been utterly trashed by all but the most steadfast defenders.
---
76's relative failure does, to some extent, prove that even the most casual Bethesda fans have standards. If they continue down this path, CD Projekt and Obsidian will eat their lunch and Bethesda will end up buried with Bioware.
---
Huh not bulk junk, that seems odd but not like it would be hard to break it back down if your not trying to vender it
---
I haven't had a chance to play Outer Worlds yet, but it looks like fun. I think I'm more impressed that it seems to more polished than the usual Obsidian release. And both companies have an unfortunate history of buggy games. But I'm amused by the statement about the game looks like a "watered down Fallout". It's not like Obsidian (in a previous life) created the entire series, or anything heh.
---
Don't forget ballistic fiber ;^)
---
I‚Äôm just saying bye. Frankly don‚Äôt see the point in announcing it to the whole world like a 16 year old on Facebook that your leaving forever. 
---
Quit, no one cares, you aren‚Äôt special.
---
Sounds like an awesome idea, my PSN is Mr\_Manfluid
---
Ummmm....what?  This sub has definitely had its positive moments, but by and large it has been so negative that it caused splinter subs to form, like r/FO76filthycasuals, so people could discuss the positive aspects of the game without being called friggin' idiots, paid shills, or worse.
---
As long as you're not paying them, you're not really harming anyone.
---
Well said.  You deleted the post but from the title hope you aren‚Äôt leaving under a misunderstanding.  Good luck out there.
---
Dude. Go troll somewhere else. Why are you so passionate about a game you don‚Äôt even play? Why do you care if people like a game you don‚Äôt? Relax.
---
"Waaah I got mocked for supporting something that ultimately hurts the game and the community." You deserved it.
---
‚ÄòI hate you Bethesda but give me couple bucks and i will forget everything and love you truly‚Äô
---
I paid for atoms.  Everything else was a bonus.
---
Plus the ncr outfit itself would probably be 800 atoms or more by itself.
---
at some point i woke up and i heard that message going off
---
how would that work on a server with a mix of level 5 and 500s?
---
Honestly I enjoyed them equally. Both had their own spin on the franchise. My sons thought I was crazy for liking it so much but I played through FO4 5 times.
---
It's just so unbelievably stupid. Russian hackers or alien influence is more believable to me.
---
:) I am with you re. Fallout 5 (or 6)...  If they mess that up, our grandchildren will not forgive them
---
Yes it is
---
I don't hold malice toward those who bought the subscription, but I still believe any who did are just suckers and are part of the mtx problem.
---
This is actually funny, some people on here must've been in the debate club, one little post about just enjoying a game and just a pile up on toxicity to try and ruin one persons perspective on a game they like playing for fun, watch this reply with get a paragraph on why Bethesda so evil and downright cruel to people who spend money on 76
---
Exactly. My point is the atoms alone make it worth it.
---
servers are down, not much else to do.
---
I was completely worth it for the Atoms alone.
---
 I paid $14, I got 1600 Atoms instantly / some emotes /   got a pretty cool outfit /  I can now store unlimited scrap components /  I also can set up A tent anywhere I want on the map basically having a second free teleport /  I can also log on to a private world anytime I feel like it.
---
 So to answer your question, absolutely I'm happy with it. Best $14 I've spent playing this game so far.
---
&gt;ameba
---
Lol your reply is: let me go spellcheck the post? Ahaha ... um yeah ... good job kiddo, now go spend your parents money on some failout microtransaction.
---
p.s. Hint: there is also a "typo" in this post. Spotted it? &lt;3
---
Maintenance ... they‚Äôll let us know when it‚Äôs done 
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
we give them "limes" ?
---
Thank you, I might even come back at some point in the future
---
Yeah. That's my plan. They need to sort this shit out and give people something to make up for it. Then I'll look at coming back regularly.
---
 Well with id, Bethesda saved them from Carmack etc, and now we have a healthy company. Willets needs to go before he wrecks something else.
---
No. Now, purchase Fallout First and enjoy the bugs.
---
Not been able to complete these either just another broken feature
---
I was really hoping wastelanders would lift this game out of it's current state. I wasn't happy about the delay but if they needed more time for quality assurance then I'd much rather wait.
---
For them now to drop this sub crap, Makes me think this took priority over content
---
Performance is actually quite good. Even a low end computer can run 76. It‚Äôs the crashes and disconnects that are a problem, and they will occur on any system, high end or low end.
---
*shrugs* I'm not sure why, but okay! I'm not really into the nonsense meta-community that's all hurt about Zane being "weak" and similar stuff. I have all 3 games and have never felt compelled to buy anything other than DLC that I very much enjoyed. 
---
If you think Borderlands is in anyway comparable to FO76 from an anti-consumer standpoint, then well... there really wasn't much point in discussing anything with you anyways.
---
I recently found a recipe for that )
---
No to exclusive weapon and armor quests. Yes to everything else.
---
Things can still be p2w even if currency is atoms.  Especially if you are talking about having to buy something that truly impacts gameplay like the ability to store unlimited scrap. Further tying it monthly is a bad idea.
---
There's this thing called [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) where people are making similar requests and is just as populated. There's also these people submitting tickets asking Bethesda to fix the shit game
---
Again, don‚Äôt care.
---
This truly saddens me to read your comment. We shouldn't just be guessing for the sake of it. We shouldn't be trying to fit the facts to our theories or conclusions but actually draw conclusions from the facts as they're presented.
---
Right now, the facts don't say much of anything at all that has ANYTHING to do with either my knowingly made up baseless theory of Bethesda being on the verge of bankruptcy nor the equally flimsy Bethesda is going public.
---
Come on man, have a higher standard for critical thinking. The only reasonable theory you could have is that Providence, a single non-major stakeholder investor in Bethesda may have been looking to exit their investment in Bethesda 3-4 years ago. That's it. That's ALL the facts support.
---
There's nothing that suggests that Zenimax is putting pressure on Bethesda Softworks. There's nothing that Bethesda is trying to maximise their appeal to investors. Nothing to suggest that massive stakeholders (not shareholders; they're very different things) are looking to leave. Just a single stakeholder with a minority stake in the company possibly looking to leave 3-4 years ago. That's it.
---
***BANG***

this sub honestly needs the no dev bashing rule,its just shitposting and circlejerking

I love remote play.  I have a PS TV upstairs I remote play to my PS4 downstairs and it's wonderful.

---
Ya, it doesn't, but thanks.

This is how they should have marketed it IMO
---
Maintenance ongoing

You need to wait until the maintenance is over.
---
Stop trying to make people brought together by a corporate entity a community.
---
Agree
---
Broken? Do you even play the game?
---
Gess all us end gamers will be spending our lives in glass cavern. Atleast there.is a lvl 80 scorchbeast in there that doesent scale down.

But do t you want your cowboy outfit?
---
Hi. You can still get badges, it just no longer shows that you‚Äôve done it. The only way to tell is to go look in the Pip Boy. 
---
Also, the drop rates are bad. It took me like 2 weeks to get 5 badges, doing both the daily bug part collection and waste tidy up quests pretty much every day.
---
I got a badge yesterday, BTW.
---
Take these upvotes then haha
---
Wait. The game is going through maintenance
---
3 hours...tell me when it's on again
---
Good for you man! See you in outer worlds !
---
Especially because Reddit is an echo chamber. Despite how much Reddit thinks they have influence, they really don‚Äôt. They might make a bit of noise once and a while that needs to be addressed by a PR person or two, but that‚Äôs about it.
---
The truth is that the vast majority of the people spending money on this aren‚Äôt here, nor do they care. And they‚Äôre not wrong, either. Who are we to criticize how they spend their money. Bethesda knows this will make them more money and they don‚Äôt care how shameless it looks because they only give a shit about their bottom line.
---
This subreddit is not what kept fallout 76 alive. The people who continue to pay them did. This is who their marketing to now. They don‚Äôt give a shit about me, or you, or anyone else here who isn‚Äôt spending money. It‚Äôs the sad truth. They don‚Äôt give a fuck, and if that bothers you then stop supporting them. The Outer Worlds is out and it‚Äôs great.
---
Make no mistake though, this scummy company knows what they‚Äôre doing because it‚Äôs making them money. When Elder Scrolls 6 comes out, people will forget about this.
---
right.  there definitely still would have been a fair amount of grumbling, because it would be *more* "pay-for-advantage" nonsense.  but it wouldnt be them holistically giving the finger to the player base.
---
as far as i know, most/all other games that have private servers charge extra for that privilege. so while people would bitch, because this is just a worse version of that, the vast bulk of players would completely accept it, and very likely most would approve of it because of included atoms.   
---
it really is the pay wall for the tent and scrap box that are the problem.  putting them in the atom shop for regular players, while still predatory, would atleast have made sense and made them extra money.  i guarantee that less than 10% of people paying for membership are doing it for the scrapbox, and less than 1% are doing it for the tent.
---

---
Well it's more than just about the value of it. Like I said we should really make an effort to make more people want it
---
I've never played Fallout 76 or any Fallout game for that matter. While I sympathize with your statement to an extent, people who find it worth their money aren't sheep. Elder Scrolls: Online launched with a subscription fee. It was also put through the wringer for a lot of poorly made pay to win choices and pointless unlocks like not being able to choose the Imperial Race and Collector's Edition backers getting access to a horse at launch.   
---
Elder Scrolls: Online then went free to play and pretty much mirrors the monetization strategy put forth by Fallout 1st. It's not a surprise why they would decide to make such a move as, of this writing, Elder Scrolls: Online has garnered fairly positive feedback in the intervening years.    
---
People need to understand that work costs money. Some people are drawn to a particular feature and say that that's all they get for their subscription, when most of the time companies are bundling features in order to make the package as a whole more palatable. The other option is to not package the features and price them ala cart. This is just another way of saying microtransactions.   
---
A lot of you folks are willingly paying people just to play video games and post it on YouTube, or to watch them play live on Twitch. A lot of you folks want to "be that guy" who plays video games and posts it on YouTube, or have people pay to watch you play video games live on Twitch. Most of you who don't pay, still enjoy watching those who play, and those who enjoy playing for you are backed by advertising dollars. Would you rather have ads pushed on you in game, or every time you log in?  
---
You don't want microtransactions. You don't want a subscription model.  
---
You want the game to be fixed. You want the game to be better. You want new content.   
---
These are mutually exclusive wants in a post launch economy.
---
Sorry you're wrong.

Even the user scores are worse for Fallout 76. 3.9 to 2.8 for Fallout 76. I repeat Fallout 76 is the worst one ever made.
---
I'm staying away from there in fear of spoilers.
---
The Outer Worlds may not be directly related to Fallout 76, but it is exactly what I wanted from a Fallout game after 4. My only complaint, is the world is more KOTOR sized, and less a never ending wasteland.
---
&gt;it is relevant to this sub because it's about all the drama that's going on with fallout first.
---
You are incorrect.
---
well skillup is - the one on the right has his own youtube and his opinions are always right on the money
---
always up for finding new reviewers though, if you have any recommendations
---
Absolutely agree.
---
As strange as it may sound, the best reaction for the game would have been maximum support for the changes from everyone.  That would've sent the message to top management and shareholders that the title is showing promise and gotten them "on board" to approve higher budgets and support.
---
As a result, we all would have a better product.
---
Did you see the yellow building? Did it have the nig pile of wood on the side that has provided all of my wood for the past several months?
---
That pile of wood is on my pilgrimage agenda.
---
Just started using remote play. Not too good for combat. HOWEVER v good for trades and farming crafting stuff
---
What new content is being added here again?
---
Private worlds are the same as any normal adventure world... just with fewer people.  If you don't have the scrap container you can still collect scrap when you need it... and the survival tent isn't anyone from from just paying the cost in caps if they want to fast travel.  You may as well be complaining that you can't get every single cosmetic from the atom shop for free.
---
Skillup - the one on the right - is the best. Look into his channel
---
Hit him first with your one shot weapons
---
No that's fine man; I agree on Borderlands, just pointing out that you did suggest that it's an example of a 'publisher who doesn't nickel and dime' when we know 2K are absolute buggers for it. I get that this wasn't the crux of your argument and yes, so far, the shittiness doesn't seem to have trickled down the 2K ladder to Gearbox.
---
Incidentally, hope B3 is great for you; haven't played it yet and Outer Worlds may set that back further.
---
I'm passionate about a franchise I've enjoyed since before some people here were born.
---
&gt; between the fuck ton of dlc and DLC not included in the season pass ,borderlands 3 being an EGS exclusive,LOTS of borderlands 3 bugs etc
---
Look, I get that BL3 hasn't been perfect. Regardless, I didn't encounter any significant bugs that prevented me from enjoying it in the 50 hours I've played. My experience might be unique, I dunno, I play it single player and mostly ignore the community. 
---
I've never felt burned by their DLC. Perhaps it's different for you, we all have our own unique experiences. I still can't play FO76 without crashing every few hours, played 50 hours of BL3 without a single crash. Sure, some of the skill tree things don't work right, I never even noticed. I'm a casual player I guess, I'm okay with it. 
---
&gt; lol
---
Touche! Boom, roasted. Oh my poor heart! Again, I think we can both objectively prove that while BL3 has had a rocky launch, Bethesda has been openly shitting on their fans for 2-3 years now. You know it, I know it. If your only defense is "hurr durr BL3 is bad too" then I dunno what to tell you.
---
the "private" servers themselves are about at market average (location depending) so pretty sure that alone is worth it.  the atoms and emotes are a nice bonus, as well as the more controversial stuff.
---
I got the robot for my camp the day it released and within the first 10 mins a guy came to my camp and called me a ‚Äúsodding cheater‚Äù, checked my vendors and left. I also bought one month of the membership, already canceled it tho. I really just wanted the outfit, and a private world to grind out the workshops for a while is a bonus. 
---
It‚Äôs no one‚Äôs business what you spend your own money on. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
So if the statements on Bethesda's official forums are similar to here, than the views here are pretty representative of the player base? Or at least the online, forum-dwelling player base?
---
Don't have aoe mutations. They can't do anything if they literally can't trigger your mutation.
---
Could you link a post or screenshots? I guess the other 2 are the Riot armor and the Desert ranger one?
---
edit: nvm found it, guess I'll wait for the desert ranger one since that one was my favourite.
---
It's not the price that's the problem. It's the fact that the armor should be in the Atom Shop, the scrap box in the base game, and the forward tent behind a quest with skins in the Atom Shop that is the problem. I would buy the subscription if all it was was the server and the atoms, but the way it is now, I can't buy it in good conscience. I don't even really need a private server with the way I play my character, but I'd still get the subscription if it didn't actively fuck over those who don't have the subscription.
---
Makes me wonder if they are paying people to play the game with this shit turned on to "normalize" it.
---
If people hop on and think that everyone else is doing it, then they might not think it's so bad.
---
You can't tell me it's incorrect, I wrote it.
---
It's about the drama because people are mad. So the best thing to do is take a break. It's not even just about this one game, I suggested more than one and other people are suggesting others.
---
Bethesda needs to pay their developers. Bethesda needs to justify it to their shareholders. Shareholders are looking to other companies who have been able to pull off microtransaction and subscription models so as to return a profit on their investment.   
---
It's clear the game shouldn't have been shipped in the condition that it was shipped in, but to be honest, neither should have Skyrim, but they still made a ton of money off of that game and that was just as or just prior to this new paradigm of rampant ala cart pricing.   
---
In order for them to continue working on Fallout 76 and to implement the kinds of things the playerbase wants, they need to incorporate SOME kind of monetization strategy. The other three options are bankruptcy, turn Fallout 76 into an offline game, or stop working on Fallout 76. They are not going to work on a game for years that doesn't make them any additional revenue. This never happens, even back in the good old days of gaming when the product shipped as is, and was run through a gamut of QA testing and what not. Once it's shipped it's shipped. Back in the day if anything was fixed or changed post launch it was done in the sequel or in an expansion pack. If you want the game to be something more than it is today the only other options are to mod it yourself, find someone to mod it for you, or pay Bethesda to do so.   
---
Them coming out with an OPTIONAL subscription model is an attempt to turn things around, as they did with Elder Scrolls: Online. If they weren't implementing a subscription model then you would know that they have no plans of improving the game. When Final Fantasy XIV screwed the pooch, they mandated you pay a subscription after an extended free period while they fixed the game. Even prior to A Realm Reborn's launch they got the game to a state where they felt they could start charging money for it. A lot of folks disagreed and left. Some folks stayed and paid because they agreed that the game was worth the subscription value as of patch 1.23. A lot of people who didn't pay then came back for A Realm Reborn, and have been playing (and paying) ever since.   
---
There's nothing wrong with asking for money. You do a thing, you ask for money. In the current state of Fallout 1st, that's all they're doing. They're saying, we're willing to do a thing, but we are asking for money to do the thing. A lot of the game's detractors are miffed that they paid for a broken game in the first place. If Bethesda games launched with no glitches we wouldn't have Skyrim. People wouldn't have careers because Skyrim wasn't launched. People wouldn't be paying their mortgages and car payments because a video game wasn't launched.   
---
Not only are these games economies in and of themselves, they are becoming a larger part of THE economy and with that comes the realization that game development is now a monetizable skill rather than just a programmers side hobby.    
---
Again, I haven't bought or purchased any Fallout game. Ever. I've played Skyrim, and was quite enthralled with my experience. It was no doubt in my mind worth the price I paid for it back in 2011, and I'm told it's not even the best Elder Scrolls game. Then when I discovered the modding scene I was blown away and was actually surprised a company was willing to let the populace alter their intellectual property to such an extent. Now I could never play vanilla Skyrim, but that doesn't mean it's not worth the price to some people.
---
You might just have to deal with it dude. I'm free to bitch about a shit product if I'd like to. And I do like to.
---
I'm having the same issue, I guess it is just because the servers are down.
---
The servers are down for maintenance
---
It was always going to be a big stink when they added in a subscription, but the game needed this; the in-game shop wasn't going to support them the way it was. And, even though there are parts I have problems with, the subscription really isn't that bad. It's almost exactly like ESO's subscription, but you get even more value here.   
---
For free players we can just keep playing like we always have. Literally nothing has changed for us. I'll sub when I can though because it's a good deal and I enjoy playing. I don't want them to remove the option to subscribe just because some of us have had a knee-jerk reaction to it.
---
Like yeah I didn't say let's go attack Bethesda. There are reason our anguish matters. It's a safe bet other people feel as we do. As people leave population declines. It's always more complicated that is seems. Also apparently Bethesda "listens" to this sub
---
I don't know dude, it seems many idiots around here like to get fucked in their ass raw. But I understand it, in the end, they payed to be Fucked 1st ;D
---
That‚Äôs nice. Let people enjoy the game if they want.
---
I'm a casual player and it hasn't ruined anything for me.
---
Settle.  Servers are down.
---
Yeah. I still have the game installed and everything. I hopped on yesterday to check out the atomic shop.
---
Might go looking for a Legendary Scorch Beast or something later.
---
To me it looks like folks had been getting a lot more than was really necessary or expected from Bethesda. They don't have to let you mod their game. They don't have to let you play on their servers for free. They don't have to fix the game even (granted they would deserve the criticism that follows). They could just develop a new game and hope that people buy that, which was pretty much par for the course for every company prior to the age of DLC and expansion packs.   
---
Look at Square-Enix. They charge $13 for both Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIV each. It's not an optional subscription either. You either pay the money or you don't play. That's on top of an initial $60 purchase. On top of that mandatory subscription you can buy story and level skip books in the cash shop. Housing is damn near impossible to experience without deferring to illegitimate methods of purchase, and no one is really bitching up anywhere near the storm that Fallout 76 is with an OPTIONAL subscription fee. I don't get unlimited crafting space with my XIV subscription fee. I don't get private servers with my XIV subscription fee. Am I a "tool" for willingly paying more per year than the Fallout 76 proposed optional subscription fee? No, I'm a just a paying customer. When I'm done with the game I'll stop paying, like I did with Final Fantasy XI.  
---
If you don't think the game is worth it, then don't buy it. If you don't think the game is worth the subscription, then don't pay the subscription. I don't feel sorry for those who purchased the game and continue to expect Bethesda to fix things after launch. You want all the benefits of a post launch economy with none of the detriments to a post launch economy. I myself, having not purchased the game, am interested in dropping $23, because the game does look to be about worth that much. That's the actual price of the game $23. Not $60, not $13/month and certainly not $100/month like the OP states in his closing lines. $23 is the price. Sorry to those who paid more, but there was sufficient warning and anyone who paid even more for the Collector's Edition bullshit. There never has been a "collector's edition" that didn't include overpriced cheap knock off bullshit. Those things exist literally only as a donation to the company. You're either buying it to sell it later to some other stupid schmuck or you're buying it to show the company that you appreciate their work.   
---
Let's also not pretend like $13/month is some kind of unbearable price point either. That's standard not even considering the price of actual things out in the real world or other forms of entertainment for that matter. I see people regularly drop more in bits on Twitch in one livestream for something the streamer would've done anyways. Hell, some of these dumbasses pay more JUST TO ASK A QUESTION ON A LIVE STREAM. Not to mention, you don't have to pay that price to begin with. I wish Final Fantasy XI or XIV's subscription was optional.   
---
You can just, not pay for the perks. The perks aren't that big of a deal. The reason I wouldn't pay for the subscription is because I don't think the perks themselves are worth the price. This is coming from a man who spent more on breakfast this morning than the actual price of a Fallout 1st membership that the emotionally compromised OP, after his tantrum, falsely claimed was $100/month.  I'm not an entitled snob who thinks I should just get those perks for free, because I shouldn't, and you shouldn't either. 
---
You're just angry because being angry feels good, and you're being manipulated by a bunch of talking heads on YouTube who are getting paid far more than $13/month not only through crowd funding but in advertising revenue on top of it. And they don't actually fucking do anything other than regurgitate reddit's opinion, then see what   
---
 other commentators are saying, and feed you the same bullshit you want to hear. And what you want, is to be angry. It's the only thing you interact with.   
---
It's the sheep who are angry. It's the sheep who can't show some self control and put their wallets on the shelf. It's the sheep who are paying too much for shit they can't derive value from.   
---
To be an adult, you first have to grow up.
---
Yea. you can buy crafting materials (which toy grind for) you can buy skill points (which you grind for) they even took out some microtransactions because "they weren't supposed to be there YET"
---
Wow, you were down voted for that?  Slippery slope fiasco all over again.  Damn gamers have bad short term memories.  
---
Have a upvote.  You don't deserve a down vote for giving a valid opinion, or voicing a valid concern.  That's bullshit.
---
My pip boy has been at 7 since the patch. Ive done about 8 quests. Not only did I not get to 8, there were no regular loot for these quests. They just end.
---
Carmack is Id software. Without him it's just Bethesda intellectual property. You can buy the rights to call your game Doom but it may not be a Doom game. (Replace Id with Black Isle and Doom with Fallout to see what I mean.)
---
More like I'm not a broke jobless loser that can actually afford 12$ a month lol
---
maybe bad luck?
---
I was on a friend's private server so maybe those are broken?
---
Returns of the game are rare and they even stipulated that in detail. Most games aren‚Äôt for the most part or you have to try and jump through a ton of red tape... 
---
I‚Äôve also never returned a game...
---
It‚Äôs because the servers are down for maintenance. Did the same thing during the beta and at launch
---
*slow clap*
---
Pay to skip every quest that is "server hop"
---
https://falloutfirst.com/ works fine at the moment - they just got swamped with traffic when the link got shared around a lot.
---
Id love to aswell would give me something worth useing ammo on.
---
ps4? yeah.
---
12:55pm (pst) and it's still down.
---
Better yet, stop trying to fix it and just do that anyway.
---
Help them die...lol
---
Phew thought it was code for you've been inadvertently banned. Was just about to throw my xbox and my copy of prey - yeah I got conned twice.. out the window
---
Happy to see other people enjoying it!
---
Yeah it just seems like they are rng. I did both on Wednesday and didn't get anything, did both yesterday and got 1 badge.
---
I see you like to spend your money wisely. I have a bridge for sale if you are interested. One time payment and it's all yours. Great location in Brooklyn. Let me know. 
---
To be honest I had fun playing the game for a minute. The community is great overall. I will no longer support Bethesda at this point. This from a guy who has spent a good chunk of money in the derided Creation Club. 
---
It's not about any perceived greed on their part. Get your paper Bethesda. It's their tone deaf refusal to support a dedicated community that emerged even after a broken game launch. If ever a community is "owed" by a company it's the FO76 community.
---
No man's sky was the reason i stuck with this game. I was really hoping that this game would pull through but i feel like I'm just making more and more excuses for the game.
---
I‚Äôm starting to get that vibe from other commenters. I really came into the scene around the time where they had done the free weekend, so I might not get the full picture of the sub.
---
They can‚Äôt destroy my camp right? As long as I don‚Äôt attack back?
---
Yes, I can because moderators decide whether a post is relevant under Rule 1.
---
Agreed.  Lack of stash space has been a shock after FO4.
---
However, everyone adapted.  The wiser players learned to keep just what they needed (understanding that junk can be picked up at any time).  Others (like me), who couldn‚Äôt get over the habits of FO4 and pick up everything, coped by having mules.
---
And we still enjoyed the game despite the inconveniences
---
By this point in the game it's only 23 buck, and if all the reddit posts are to be believed then all of the original buyers have quit the game.  Hell, the game dropped in price a week after launch so who in the hell pays 60 dollars for a game one sale for 20.  shit I just bought a digital copy for my kid for 12 last week, so where's the full price?
---
Ppl said they wanted MMO PvP. It was provided. Now everyone complains about PvP.
---
I don't agree with it, but griefing is a part of any and all PvP online games. It just is. I hate it, which is why I refuse to play them. 
---
I just refuse to put my limited gaming time into something that's going to be ruined by some loser with no life and Momma's credit card.
---
The community manager is simply the messenger, so I will never insult them. However, trying to defend a bad game, that clearly does not care about you, or the community, and it now trying to leech even more money is a poor move. Other games exist, you should give them a try instead of rewarding the poor behavior of Bethesda.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yASjD\_And2w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yASjD_And2w)  I found a few ok shots of it in this old vid that Bethesda made, definitely more yellow.  Around 0:59 is where the gameplay starts, and 1:27 you get a good look.  It's so wild Bethesda decided to leave it out of the game til now! (especially considering they left the plain fireman helmet in-game at the Whitespring toy shop)
---
That's really sad. All you're doing is helping drive people away from the sub and on turn the game.
---
&gt; MMO shooters 
---
Well unless you happened to catch firefall for the couple of years online there hasn't really been any other quality shooter MMOs. They all sorta fall flat on impactful gunplay.
---
For me the point on which "enough is enough" is as it typically is for most people. Once it starts personally negatively effecting me. But I do not mind all the negativity they get for their actions thus far as it seems a hole they've worked hard to dig themselves. However everyone will remember a loss of trust and keep that in mind when it comes to future releases.
---
Totally fair points. BL3 was just the most recent game I played that was bullshit free, that I could just kick back and enjoy. Perhaps not the best example. 
---
Enjoy the Outer Worlds, friend!
---
I don't think $13 a month is all that unreasonable.
---
Why can‚Äôt the sub have more people like you? Fully developed humans with the ability to knit together a complex thought and formulate novel ideas. 
---
I inexplicably find myself browsing the sub during downtime at work, and my mental image of the average poster is a super mutant jabbing at a keyboard, howling with rage and struggling through the cognitive gauntlet of basic reading comprehension.
---
You didn‚Äôt click the link obviously
---
The map is great and the combat/enemies are fun. But the game could be so much better -- fix the bugs, implement quality-of-life changes (like perk card loadouts, text chat, a global trading post, and many others) and deliver more frequent/better content. We were kinda promised these things but we got so little.
---
You actually bought the subscription?
---
No, you deserve to be ridiculed because the game industry is going the wrong direction, and you're helping them. I just don't agree with personal attacks. But you deserve flak for it.
---
No doubt, the RPG elements were dumbed down. I enjoyed the gunplay more so it balanced out the experience for me. I absolutely love the Fallout world design. Sometimes their art department doesn't get the love they deserve because the programmers screw things up. I get a lot of enjoyment just wandering around the maps.
---
I appreciate your perspective. Thanks for doling out some hope!
---
Correct. I‚Äôve been stuck at a certain number of badges for days before getting another badge, and that‚Äôs doing 2 quests each day. Also, there is ZERO indication that you get caps or badges, all you see is the loot.
---
I think they should add back the badge icon you used to see on completion when you got one, but I guess they won‚Äôt.
---
Their first official response on the issues was to call everyone having the issues liars. They don't give a fuck as long as they get their buck.
---
I‚Äôm glad these posts with some sense actually make it to hot
---
A consumer who wants a better product? I‚Äôm sorry you are having a hard time understanding this. 
---
I‚Äôm telling people how to spend their money because it affects me. Maybe if you had any concern for anyone‚Äôs gaming experience other than your own, I wouldn‚Äôt have to explain this to you.
---
The earth casts a round shadow on the moon, but Flat Earth
---
This really has nothing to do with Fallout 1st.
---
It has everything to do with keeping the subreddit on topic.
---
If anything, this announcement puts MORE focus on the criticism of Fallout 1st by removing off-topic posts crowding it out.
---
&gt; I am the lorax
---
look this guy says hes the lorax because i completely ignored the point of what he said and edited his quote down to fit a narrative.
---
0 impact on Bethesda? Can you elaborate why you feel this way?
---
Well, it hurts to hear truth sometimes.
---
Thanks buddy and have a nice weekend.
---
Interesting. Reminds me how players with duped weapons and armor got bored because combat wasn't a challenge anymore.
---
I primarily play a melee/grenade build and it works really well for that. I've had mixed results using ranged weapons outside of VATS.
---
Umm last i knew you can get repair kits from the queen.
---
I speak french so it's normal that I do mistakes. And again, we have the right to complains. You could reply to me as much as you want. I would answer the same answer. Since you doesnt seem to understand, I will try one last time.
---
Imagine I bought a toyota, in their adds, they say the car has no problems. I buy the car. Then the brakes doesnt work well, the engine make a weird sound, the light doesnt work. It would be 100% understable to complains about your purchase right? And then Toyota doesnt want to repair the car, and charge me even more and say they are not responsible for their shitty car.
---
 Now imagine a random dude who never bought a toyota saying to you " bro, stop complaining, you are alway complaining and never happy, you should just go along with your shitty car"
---
F it was removed
---
Fair point.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of good will from previous Fallout titles.  It‚Äôs important for this title to succeed.  
---
However, indiscriminate backlash and negativity will simply cause Bethesda management and shareholders to withhold further support for this game‚Äôs development
---
yeah It's been under maintenance for like 3 hours, I just want to play the game
---
I don't think so. There ain't as much bitching on official forums or non-english fallout 76 related sites. It's just... reddit
---
No one is wanting Bethesda to fail. We want them to fix the game so we can get back to playing and enjoying our games -  we don‚Äôt care if Bethesda is trying to please their investors. Gamers are the casualty here. I bought 3 copies of this game when they were 60$ a pop, but for me the lack of NPCs has ruined the series. Seriously I don‚Äôt give a crap about the 100$ fiasco because my issue is with the base game. It is just bizarre to see that they delayed waste landers dlc which the base game sorely needed, and focused on other priorities.
---
If you buy Fallout 1st, are you still a casual player? 
---
Why did your friend buy the subscription? Did your friend say that it has ruined the game for him or is that your interpretation?
---
Second players are waiting for an issue with first players benefits.
---
Good idea! And make a PC with big screen that's shows the amount of all sorts of scrap to place in your camp
---
Thanks, you too.
---
You think this is about the money?
---
Which Im aware of. Im no longer seeing the list of loot on screen, or any indication of quest being completed. It just ends.
---
To be fair, CD:PR are probably the only AAA games publisher to completely escape it so far. They're the darlings of the gaming world for a reason.
---
Now now, can't be going about being too civil to each other on Reddit, world might collapse as a result! 
---
Enjoy the ride with B3 and may it remain bullshit free.
---
Yeah really buried here lmao
---
The problem for you hand-wavers, is that a lot of us, just don't care about your opinions. You can hold your breath and kick your feet all you want, you'll never get more than a "meh" from me. I'll log in tonight, like any other time, group up with the same friends I usually do, and play the game like nothing's changed. Because it hasn't.
---
Same for PS4.
---
Too bad I can't download any community patches for my 100 dollar annual ""private server"" subscription :( :( :( :(
---
I beat the first chapter last night, it‚Äôs fucking amazing. New Vegas level of choices, gameplay and skills management all throughout. And dialogue and unique weapons.
---
Holy Bethesda what were they thinking
---
I wonder if anyone in here ever tried playing runescape....kinda the similar idea here, I mean for the scrap box anyways. But even runescape members have a limited number of bank slots but it's way higher than non members.
---
Yeah I hate it because it‚Äôs so rampant. I‚Äôve had some Fun respectful pvp battles in fallout 76, but we didn‚Äôt go any further than just have a good shoot out. Of course I signed up for the good and bad when I started playing the game...It‚Äôs just so Hit and miss, especially with those kids with their moms credit cards.
---
i mean that's how subscriptions works
---
That‚Äôs the idea of subscriptions
---
That would be neat, but it would be better if it was free.
---
And I'm not stopping you, bitch and whine as much as you please just making a point and opinion on what I think about the game, the replies are nothing but toxic haters that spent money on this game trying to change one person's opinion and join the hate train for this game you say what you want you enjoy this game good you dont enjoy this game good, I love it because of my love for the series and lore it's self and I'm gonna enjoy it regardless of the hatred from the community, the lesser the player count the more rare drops like magazines bobbles and blueprints to pick up and less imposter sheepsquatch pvp tryhards to ingore
---
log off immediately to save your camp
---
Oh, ok, gotcha. That is new. I did the 2 quests yesterday and saw the loot list at the end.
---
Yeah, make it a second CAMP.
---
/irony off
---
You do you, just don't expect to make friends on the game anymore.
---
I honestly don't care, I'm just glad there is are servers for the violent ppl to go on
---
for me, it's fun. fallout and silent hill have been my bag. silent hill is gone, fallout is still here so it's my ish.
---
Personally I have never had an issue farming materials are high-value legendaries on the public servers but I have been playing since launch
---
Do the right thing and uninstall
---
 Carmack is gone. He very nearly destroyed id with his lack of interest in the games, just the code and how they ran, was all he cared about. As a result several people, mainly Tim  "COD is great, they make money" Willets got control of the game and gave us Rage and very nearly a completely wrong Doom 4. 
---
 After Bethesda took control they scrapped Doom 4 and built the wonderful game we have now as Doom 2016.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre getting the harassment, man. I can‚Äôt say I wasn‚Äôt tempted to get the subscription, so I uninstalled. But people can‚Äôt change anyone but themselves, it‚Äôs no ones fault for the subscription except Bethesda - they‚Äôre the ones who broke a promise, the rest are just getting the benefits of 76
---
Nobody is holding you hostage her ! Its not like Todd Howard is threathing with a glock right now to defend fallout 76 right now, you now ...hah hahaha .....
---
I thought they were pretty clear in the description of it?
---
Plus, it is a *subscription*.
---
Yup. FO5 is their chance at redemption it seems. Even then I wont preorder it like I did NV and 4.
---
[This is the plane I'm thinking of doing a Vault Tec livery on](http://phoenixmodel.com/Product.aspx?ProductId=599). Vault Tec Aerobatic Squadron.

---
This, it might not be directly related but it is from the same Fallout developers I loved, not these cash grabbing P.O.S.'s. 
---
You know, the cash grabbing P.O.S.'s that charge a triple A title price for a amateur game, promise not to put in micro-transactions that are P2W and then repeatedly do so, delay content to develop and release additional cash grab content, and then to introduce a monthly fee for required items that should of been in the game from the get-go. @Bethesda Developers how do you sleep with yourself at night doing all this?
---
The "casual player'is going to have the same experience as before latch 14. The only people who are having a change in gameplay are the 1st members
---
It won't. The actions of this company over the last 4 months show they are not operating honestly. I have zero hope for Wastelanders. Do the right thing and uninstall and forget you ever bought it.
---
Huh? I'm extremely confused by what you mean here and on what basis you are saying it.
---
I've clicked on both yours and mine and they're both working and showing (essentially) the same stuff - except https://falloutfirst.com/ is (at present) working faster, and the person that posted it has recently added a link to the top of the page encouraging people to donate to Extra Life, a charity that raises funds to help children in hospital play games. There was a period where it wasn't working earlier this week, but it's fixed now.
---
I reread the title and checked what sub I was in 3 times. Uhhh
---
I follow this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c7frpq/my_ammolead_farming_guide/
---
Can't comment on camp locations though.
---
The funny thing is though, the problem wasn't intentional. At least not to a large extent. Stash sizes were limited for server stability. Remember the duping days when people had so much shit that that the game was barely playable, when the servers weren't busy crashing?
---
The ironic thing is the fact that unlimited junk stashes have the potential to at least lean us back towards that issue, to a lesser extent.
---
I personally don't get why they didn't make it available to everyone, and increase the size of it slightly for subscriptions, or all together just leave it out and maybe give subscribers 200 or so more stash space. That'd create incentive for some, without being somewhat game breaking. At least it's something that's more convinience than performance focused, but the contrast between quality of life of a subscriber and non-subscriber seems pretty massive.
---
Excavator armor lucky hole mines for lead and killing cave crickets for acid
---
Mining it.
---
Lol. How about anarchy?
---
You should work for any mainstream news organizations. You can really stretch the truth and stuff words right in people‚Äôs mouths.
---
I recommend CNN, FOX, or any big name. They‚Äôll love you!
---
I fully believe we should blame the people that constantly spend money on this game. Sorry, but enabling this decision by buying it is why it happens.
---
That being said, there is absolutely no reason to attack players. They just used their money how they wanted, and even if we don't agree, we shouldn't attack them.
---
 Op I blame you and people like you for the state the game is in with the micro transactions. However, I am sorry that people thought attacking you was the right way to handle it, because it's not.
---
A CIVIL discussion is the way to handle it, and if anyone  resorts to insults and personal attacks, they are a problem.
---
I placed my camp once at a acid deposit and claimed that one workshop in the toxic valley. For lead, I throw on my excavator pa and hit up lucky hole mine.
---
Wow... what you just wrote is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever read. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone is now dumber for having read it. I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul...
---
game offline for maintenance thanks to the hole scrap going missing bug for first users
---
Im pretty sure its just server maintenance.
---
Later days, buddy
---
Hmmm... If you say you bought the subscription...then why aren't you putting the private server to use? 
---
 Posting this on the Xbox subreddit might be helpful too.
---
So...you bought the subscription? Why?
---
i get my lead from lucky hole mine you can get 500+ per run in miner boi power armor but then you need more acid
---
Wasnt me, I've had some weird guy following me around reddit. Was probably reported by him. Although I'm not sure why. I thought we all had fun. Blocked him, but he stalks me lol.
---
Would kindly ask you to leave nuclear winter mode out of this. For a battle royale, it works pretty well and is pretty much fair play (excluding the ability to nuke with 10 players left on the map). It even has cosmetics that can be unlocked by **playing** without the need for purchase. *What a concept!*
---
Irrelevant to the perceived "investment" of folks who spent way too much on console games.  Even spending another penny on a game they already own will put a lot of folks off just on principle.
---
(Full disclosure: I don't own a console newer than pong, and am full on PC...just trying to explain a possible perspective that's really fricken common.)
---
*Thank you sir, may I have another?*  - Bethesda customers
---
Unfortunately if that's your gig, no it doesn't. But there are awesome co-op games out there that you can play!
---
If we put ourselves in the shoes of the person responsible for FO76... and cared for the game...
---
Understanding that the game is losing money, we would need to show some revenue to get approval for further development.  Otherwise, any competent manager would cut the losses and order winding down.
---
If they haven‚Äôt figured it out a year into it, they‚Äôre not gonna figure it out. 
---
At this point they‚Äôre just trying to monotonize whatever they can.
---
I‚Äôm honestly surprised people still play the game. Do you not think that perhaps continuing to support careless game development might cause some difficulties down the road? If instead companies realized that ‚Äúhey if we do a terrible job we will actually make less money‚Äù....you think they might start *trying* again?
---
Stuff like this doesn't make any sense. Like the first time you visit a vendor the title on top of the items box has the name of the last vendor you were at. Or if you go to the legendary script machine and then go to a player's Camp it will say like legendary vendor at the top.
---
Stuff persists that shouldn't.
---
At this point the best thing they can do to preserve that good will is refund the buyers who already bought Fallout 1st, make it free to all, release the server software so people can still play it even after Beth's servers shut down if they so desire, then just cut support for 76 entirely so they can focus on the next proper installment. The longer they keep milking 76 the more good will they erode.
---
It‚Äôs not content, it‚Äôs a feature
---
I subbed and I feel bad for doing it. I think the bins should be universal and tents should be deconstructed for when main bases log in. I also think the atom shop in its current form is a cancer. I‚Äôve bought stuff from there too since atom quests are so god damn awful. The game in general is good enough to play. But it feels like They are actively trying to get us to quit. Everyone I know that played quit because the end game is so boring. No one wants to come back because it‚Äôs not worth the bugs. They don‚Äôt sit and shit post here though.
---
We were talking about that this morning, farming all fusion core producers? Those will likely be a part of it. I set up a scrip shopkeep a while back, scrip is it's sole sale base. The actual legendary role being immaterial.
---
I haven't thought too far into it, but selling scrip will be one way for me. I sell more crafted goods than ammo though, my friend is our ammo guy, we pay him but his main cap influx is definitely ammo.
---
At the end of the day caps will still be as pointless (for higher levels) as it is now. I'll still be happy to pay 1c/round of whatever to save from having to farm materials.
---
My personal overall goal is to farm legendaries for friends and trade value.
---
Who the hell bought this game? I got it for free on Twitch Prime. Totally worth $0 tho
---
EDIT: I know most people here bought it, just saying it is a really awesome $0 game. I play the hell out of it but don't buy any atoms. It's a really fun free game.
---
They‚Äôre taking it out on you and others because y‚Äôall SUPPORT this madness, of no one bough the 7$ fridge they wouldn‚Äôt implement 7$ fridges , if no one paid 18$ for blue power armour paint they WOULDN‚ÄôT SELL 18$ paint jobs. 
---
Star Wars battlefront 2 is an example of how people refuse ridiculous transactions and the game dev had to respond.
---
I can't speak to the non-english sites but the official forums are heavily moderated for criticism. I don't even mean the ranty mean hate comments that we can see here. I mean actually legitimate criticisms.
---
Bethesda wouldn't have an official presence here if we weren't representative of the player base. Why waste the money and effort here otherwise. The facts speak for themselves, even if you don't agree.
---
Still figuring out where I sit but anarcho-communism has been looking pretty appetizing lately!
---
I think you mean moderated.
---
The shills are out in full force right now. Downvoting anyone who doesn't bow down to Godd Howard. 
---
This is so fucking stupid.
---
I don‚Äôt blame them, I put 400 hours into 76 before it ran out of content this summer, then proceeded to play 400 hours of new Vegas on 3 characters since I‚Äôd never played it. They weren‚Äôt wrong
---
I'm a casual player and it has ruined it for me
---
We're pissed off because Bethesda said all the content and fixes would be free.
---
What are you talking about bro? My portable tent already killed 30 scorchbeasts for me today and spits out new b/e/15 Fixers once every ten minutes.  The attached stove also turns water into Coors Light.
---
With the servers not being pristine (it looks like they're recycling/queueing Survival servers, Fallout 1st members are getting the oldest unused instance, etc) no one is going to be able to loot the entire world but they are definitely going to have an easier time of it. Legendary items themselves probably won't be as big a deal - RNG is still RNG. I'm more concerned with the value of all trade goods falling under 1 cap per unit, meaning everything is valued close to the same because it's no longer hard to get. When (IF) the stash boxes get fixed it will get worse because FO1st players will have unlimited hoarding space.
---
that's cute
---
Proud of you OP
---
That's unpleasant, a lady above said she bought it so her daughter could play with out interruption.
---
Do you hope she lost her stuff?
---
Bro the only people complaining are the 600 pound cheese smelling cheeto eaters who are sitting on their couch with a oxygen tank and welfare who cant afford premium
---
Removed because truth can't be handled by people suffering from denial.
---
Want me to send you like 20 bucks so you can buy some punctuation from the atom shop?
---
Oh it was terrible (day 1 beta, and play nearly every day).
---
It‚Äôs likely that they found a new way to store the information on junk, the number they have of each (that‚Äôs why bulk isn‚Äôt allowed) and not each item counted individually.
---
I would have been fine with that. It's the paid unlimited stash I'm pissed off about, so you're idea is a really good one.
---
I know of one spot where lead and acid are in the same spot but theres a fissure site near by. It's down south in the savage divide kinda near that vault.
---
I see where you‚Äôre coming from... but our views differ
---
&gt; ...**all our content**...
---
Wait, what content is locked behind Fallout 1st?  Private servers, monthly atoms, scrap box are QoL and Cosmetic which is typical for a subscription.  
---
Is there content locked behind it too?  What did I miss?
---
&gt; After scrolling through the subreddit, I'm proud that everyone is standing up to this and uninstalling the game, just as I did. 
---
By uninstalling, your giving them the money you paid for the game and they are doing nothing in return for you. At least if you kept playing without sub, your putting some amount of strain on the resources. Now they just have your cash and your left with a salty taste. 
---
Also that isn't going to be an accurate metric at all. People who aren't uninstalling are either unlikely to brag about it or don't want to be shamed by the rest of y'all.
---
Being in a private world by myself on a lvl 290ish, 52 and lvl 15 character, I saw various level ranges across those characters in the same areas. That is, outside of the area where you just loaded in which is typically the lowest possible.
---
Are you sure scaling doesn't work properly? I find it hard to believe as it seems even more reliable when you're literally the only one entering areas and triggering enemy spawns.
---
*...who else would it be?*
---
 I gave my buddy my old GTX 460 and he ran it for 5 years in his moms old machine playing everything up to Fallout 4 just fine. Was given a 4k TV and it died fairly quickly. ;)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meqlpAtU-so Here's some testing of the engine I sourced for it!
---
The biggest change was to public events. Seems like another event every ten minutes. Feels juuuust right
---
Yes, it‚Äôs called pay up MF or we will limit your stash and devaluate your caps... and it‚Äôs totally OP
---
Teh Bethenders are out in full force trying to claim sour grapes on all this backlash. They're the subgroup that Bethesda is making their money from. Let them keep spending cash on a fucking hat. The true fallout fans know this is a disaster. 
---
$160 for the full game. Absolutely disastrous.
---
a) thank you for helping fund Wastelanders for all players to enjoy
---
b) The community IS toxic now, no doubt. Which is why I want to know where all the 'community managers' went. It's their JOB literally to navigate these concerns and to de-escalate them. Instead they're all playing Outer Worlds right now.
---
Lucky hole mine (upper parts, and locked room) can also be filled with cave crickets sometimes, its either crickets, roaches, mole rats, or ants. I just server hop til I find them, and a single run gets me all the lead ore and acid I need.
---
As others have said, for lead do luck hole mine in excavator armour
---
For acid take hemlock holes maintenance, spruce knob, federal disposal field and abandoned bog Town (or any combination of those, hemlock holes is a must because of 3 acid extractors)
---
Build only generators and acid extractor, level 0 lock
---
60 acid every 20/30 minutes, I watch Netflix or clean or whatever and just wait it out
---
Haha oh that‚Äôs funny, I‚Äôm not surprised tho, I guess it‚Äôs not the pvp that pisses me off really more of the camp destroying shit. And then he hides his base at Seneca rocks.
---
There are usually 2000+ people browsing this sub and I think over 200k subscribed. Most national political polls use sample sizes of about 1000. So if nothing else, we certainly provide an adequate sample size.
---
See you for Wastelanders though
---
How do you get 500+ lead ore per run I only manage 280ish dont know if I'm missing veins thought I was pretty thorough
---
Actually i did not walk around asking people if they bought it. No where in my comment did i even imply that. Learn to read before you Reply to people. If you must know i did my usually rounds looking at shops and if i saw someone with the ranger armor on i counted it. Considering the ranger armor is locked to the subscription  service  id say its a pretty reasonable assumption to say they had the service. The guy i chatted with we started discussing about a weapon he had for sale and ended up branching into a conversation about the armor. I could care less if people want to piss away more money on a stupid stuff in the atom store. Its their money. 
---
You wanna keep justifying Bethesda predatory practices be my guest. But i am not the only one pissed off over this. They told us a long time ago the only thing they would sell is cosmetic items. That went right out the window with what little postives this game had. Thats why people are pissed off. Why should we have to shell out more money for a game that still has not been fully fixed or lose out on content because we don't have the subscription. Bethesda was making money on the atom store but they had be greedy. If they where not prepared to handle the amount of work these online games take, they should have stuck to single player then. 
---
People laughed when they where warned about the fridge being a slippery slope but honestly thats the next step for Bethesda. Everything great in the atom store will be locked to the subscription and any new content will get put on private servers first. So Enjoy the game while it lasts because Bethesda really screwed themselves this time. Eventually that subscription wont be enough to keep the game running long term. So you do you sunshine but i am done with this game and I recommend anyone else tired of these companies ripping us off do the same.
---
My man, the 'fanbase' around this game is a feckin cult
---
*JUST STOP PLAYING THIS PIECE OF SHIT GAME!!!!!*
---
I just bought the game before this subscription shit, too. God damnit, Bethesda.
---
Please, by all means. And I'd appreciate if you would show me the same kindness. 
---
Let people shit on the game if they want.
---
&gt; This is exactly what I did. This system exist in other MMOs and i've done it there before too. Pay for the expanded stash, fill that shit up to the brim to free up space in main stash, cancel service, profit.
---
Runescape? I did that several times. Get placeholder items, and as long as you left at least 1 of that item in your bank, it can be endlessly filled up once your membership ended.
---
That... makes sense actually. Otherwise how could we have mods? I might mod the game with certain weapons and creatures. Nobody else can really be on that map unless they have the exact same mods.
---
Huh. Looks like I won't be playing with mods.
---
I think it's a legitimate concern, and players that may already be struggling within the damaged in-game economy, will suffer more. 
---
But I don't see it affecting the economy nearly as much as duping or exploits. Players still have to put the time in, and deal with the horrid drop rates.
---
But nobody is forcing the membership
---
Just gave this hot mess of "1st" a go, and on logging in to a private world and going to Harper's Ferry, I encountered a lot of &lt;20 level mobs (scorched, ghouls, muties...typical HF stuff).  My character is level 250+.
---
After a few minutes I got the more normal for my level muties at 60.
---
Maybe that's not broken, but it doesn't make a lot of sense.
---
Can you gameshare the fallout 1st subscription? More specifically the infinite chest and ability to make private servers
---
And just don't defend them from players, you're not losing anything because generators and extractors will only use workshop scrap, not yours
---
It could very well be. But at least as of right now, there's still a big gap between 100,000 junk and people having millions of specific items I guess, so hard to tell how much of an impact it'll have long term, if any.
---
I guess it might also eventually be more noticeable if a full adventure mode server is filled with people having 200k junk each, compared to if you're by yourself in a server.
---
Quitter here. I absolutely loved playing this game but after a while I got bored. Only played to do dailies and weekly challenges for atoms after doing all the main missions and such. It just got so boring for me, doing that for atoms. But I enjoyed playing it :) The reason I left was because I was having a blast in borderlands 3 and now modern warfare is out so my time will be invested into those games. Till doom comes out üòâ
---
Yeah, that file is player based, still 10kb, and instead stored with others on the cloud. Ya know, the one of many that hold hundreds of thousands of TB Worth of data every day...
---
Orange you just projecting, tho?
---
If you don't want see the posts in a sub, just unsubscribe from it. The I'm leaving post is completely unnecessary and just puts yourself out there to get flamed.
---
Have you even played NV? I love 76 but NV is great.
---
I'm curious if this is a bug, or sneaky people on friends list going into private servers and hitting areas before owners do.
---
No, it‚Äôs a dumb thing... never proper tested the shit before release...
---
Probably not, but doing quests and stuff will probably require you to subscribe to Fallout 1st in order for the servers to be able to deal with all that shit without disconnecting, lagging, etc. I joined a private server two days ago and even shotguns worked well. Silo runs are a breeze, no waiting for those cores.
---
So probably yes.
---
There‚Äôs also the vault raid crafting system and exclusive armors. Vault 94 is open and has 3 different scenarios that switch weekly. They reward vault 94 steel and plans for 3* thorn armor and solar power armor, which get an extra legendary effect for wearing all 5 pieces
---
I think xbox ties subscriptions to accounts, so I dont think those share. Good question, tho. Someone should test it.
---
It's a shame though i felt it had potential
---
Yeah it happened to me but it‚Äôs not so bad thank god I had all my other stuff
---
I'm enjoying both fo76 and outer worlds.
---
You‚Äôre cute
---
...and I wonder what isn't.
---
This is odd. If someone hates Bethesda enough to harass their players in-game, why is that person ALSO playing the game? xD
---
Doesn't make a lot of sense so IMO these people are probably just trolls who don't genuinely care that much and want to mess with you. So asking them nicely probably won't help. Just put them on ignore.
---
I seriously hope the blowback doesn't end soon because Bethesda really deserves it this time, but I imagine this kind of targeted harassing will go away before long.
---
Wait, whaaaa?  Where?!
---
Is the ESO in your name a reference to Elder Scrolls Online? Because that's fucking rich coming from someone who plays that moneypit. I understand if I misunderstand your username, but ESO is so much worse
---
Mine is the 4chan edited one, everyone else is seeing it.  My bad I assumed you just made a random conclusion.
---
Bruh, you‚Äôre crazy and have no idea what your talking about. Can you not see the logical fallacies in your example.
---
I don't know, with all the scrap boxes I have seen it seems is is pretty attractive.
---
Funny, I'm enjoying it... Thanks for saying I deserve it.
---
Actual definition:
---
Insanity:
---
extreme foolishness or irrationality.
---
Sounds like a lot of people reacting so strongly against fo76
---
Camo netting would be pretty sweet actually.
---
This didn't age well
---
I think you hit the nail on the head with resource farming being the endgame for most people.
---
Maybe you need to wear Excavator armor when mining.
---
Called it
---
I do
---
Thanks this is good, didn‚Äôt know abt all these weight locations.
---
I've never farmed acid before but I've accumulated a couple thousand during the meat week event from all the creatures. I just collect the acid off enemies now like the Yoagui, insect glands and other enemies.
---
Unpopular opinion, you get what you pay for. Bethesda has proven themselves to continue lowering their bar of quality (which was never high) for least amount of effort for most profit. Anyone who bought this game helped contribute to this nightmare DLC that potentially catches on in the industry ala horse armor.
---
lucky hole mine + excavator PA for lead.  One a good day, you'll exit with well over 400 lead, a fair amount of steel depending one which enemies, and at least 100 crystal.
---
Acid - I camp on an acid note/have an extractor, but I loot much more from antifreeze, fertilizer, waste acid jars, coolant caps, wendigo teeth,   insect parts, yogis, and a few other items that I cant think of the name right now
---
They're not afraid, they're looking forward to reduced over head from shutting it down.
---
thanks for sharing
---
Fallout 1 is going to devastate the economy in so many ways but are you really surprised and do you think that Bethesda eally cares it took them several months to stop duping and I'm pretty sure they're still several methods to duplicate out there I just don't care.
---
Is the stash box only for materials or does it also include items?
---
NOICE! How long have you two been married?
---
My brother and his husband just got married, but they just went down to the courtroom and he texted me saying "so this happened" with a pic of their certificate. haha - it was still adorable. He was beaming.
---
The Grafton Monsters give acid as well as the cave crickets. Server hop Hemlock Holes and you‚Äôll usually get one, and sometimes Snallygasters, which also give acid. What Spud said for lead.
---
I went there and like only 40 ore then couldn‚Äôt get enough acid to make it viable. Where do u get ur acid
---
\&gt; Uhh, sorry but every game has issues. 
---
Is that really a good excuse, though? You have games like the original Kingdom Hearts, a game that came out in 2002, with no bugs at all. Least of all the crippling kind of bugs.
---
I remember the consensus for FO3 and FONV being "They're goood game's, but their buggy as hell". The thing people are defending about NV is the gameplay and possibly the story.
---
I'm. Still waiting for wastelander update. I rly don't care about fallout 1st. Would never buy it, I never buy stuff in atomic shop for real money.
---
This game is not competitive for me, so other players can have limitless trashcan and fridges what so ever. I play that game to explore the world do Quests and stuff. I mean, for me that Abo is more like renting ur own pvt server. If u wanna have that, share the amount with the friends u wanna play on it, so that everyone like pays 3 dollars a month for it.
---
I mean how much would have it costed to rent a server by a third party company to host ur own pvt world on it? 15 or 25 dollars a month? I get that people are pissed cause the game is still buggy and people feel betrayed. For me who never gave a shit about mtx in any mp game, as long as I don't have to grind endlessly mobs for hrs in the same area to get further its fine for me.
---
I played it at launch for like 50 hrs and stopped playing it cause I explored most of it,had other games that hooked me.
---
If wastelanders is good, and a rich addition to the game I will Try it again. Until then it doesn't rly have my interest. Still have to play 3 kingdoms campaign
---
Lmao I‚Äôve played world of tanks. I understand the concept of how team death match works, and don‚Äôt get upset from dying... I just don‚Äôt get off seeing others get upset over it.
---
Then why did it not say so!
---
I'm sure there will be a version of it available in the Atom shop eventually.
---
you mean if someone takes over your workshop, you can just come back and steal their acid?
---
As a casual player who also can only play a couple hours a week since Beta, I agree. First is no deal breaker. I enjoy playing in a server with complete randoms. This community is fantastic. I have yet to have a bad experience with anybody I come across.
---
NPCs do fight each other, watch it happen all the time on my sneaky sneak toon
---
I see. I do play it, I just don't want them to split the player base even further.
---
Well I wish they would've posted that on the screen!
---
agreed, value of caps will go up ammo and junk related things will go down.  also feel like weapon and armour prices will rise as well.   ive already raised script price from 20 to 30 per. farming legendarys could be more profitable even with shit traits.  just my thoughts.
---
Completely agree. I joined the moment it was known to exist. Which was basically just after the trailer. It's always been bipolar (large groups of people have different opinions!) but my god has it mainly been negative.
---
You guys DO know that the game IS IN OPEN BETA AND NOT EVEN NEAR COMPLETION... Riiiiiight??
---
The servers aren't locally hosted. Thanks gods because my isp sucks.
---
Uh no. There isn't a file for you. Your data is in a relational database.
---
You should be getting atleast 200 lead ore dont forget to use the excavator armor. I do the raids which spawn plenty of crickets but I believe Tanaga town in the mire spawns alot
---
I‚Äôm not the guy who commented above but I‚Äôm in the same boat. No one who actually loves the game hates people who still play the game or even those who bought subscriptions, it‚Äôs not their fault. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs choice what to spend their money on. We hope by leaving that something gets changed - if it doesn‚Äôt, then Bethesda will hopefully cater to those still left. Truly hope it goes well for everyone playing because I want to come back eventually, but I lost faith myself
---
My thing has always been that broken down or bulked scrap (pick one) should weigh nothing in stash.  It would make life better for players and be easier on the (barely functional AWS) servers.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
The same way Borderlands 3 does it, each player fights the enemy at their level. Would make it much more bearable
---
You can get close to 400 ore there in one run
---
The game detects where u have been. If u looted a place already on one server. Its also looted in the other server. Even the pvt ones.
---
I don't know about hate posts but if you make legit criticism posts, they stay. Just visit official forum and you will see some criticism posts there as well. Only difference is that official forum isn't 90% hate posts like it is on reddit. Go see for yourself
---
Ok.... seriously 
---
After level 50-70 most players can get more junk than they reasonably need, selling stuff for 1400 caps is a simple 10-15 farming run (getting some legendaries and scrip along the way).  These ‚Äúpremium‚Äù options don‚Äôt have significant effect on gameplay (to be fair - they don‚Äôt have effect on my gameplay)
---
I support the idea proposed by another Redditor that all of these options should also be available through in-game atoms.  
---
So far all content was free.  However, I am not sure if this model is viable long term
---
You must be missing some of the veins. Some are kinda easy to miss since they don't stand out. You'll come out of there with a metric shitton of lead if you're hitting them all.
---
I'm against the subscription providing Gameplay features that are inaccessible unless you fork over more money, on top of the money your already paid. I bought the game at release as well as at least 40$ worth in atom points/bundles, yet they keep shoveling the shit excuse that scrap kits/bots, fridges, and endless scrap storage need to monentized to keep the game running. If your okay with this type of monetization for your game, and its not a big deal to you, then expect to be treated like a piece of cattle for the rest of your life, because that's all your are to Zenimax/Bethesda.
---
Charging for private severs is fine, that make sense. Charging for Ranger Armor, Cosmetics and Emotes is fine, they said when the game came out that you will pay charging for cosmetics to help support DLC releases.
---
But after all this time, after all this money I (we) already spent on this game, is still bug riddled and feature barren.
---
They're decent, ethical and respectable ways to monetize your online game, and this is not one of them. That's a fact, not an opinion.
---
Same here, had frozen regenerating ghouls everywhere
---
Gee its like people want to enjoy the game and not get fucked over at the same time.
---
Cool
---
Oh, yeah true. Still it seems like an awfully long shot that it would be any sort of insider scheme.
---
If I'm enjoying the game then is isnt blind faith. The difference is that I play for fun and dont take it seriously when other players are allowed to buy more content. I have a life and so I dont let a hobby make me lose my shit. That's you and the people like you.
---
Your thinking on this is backwards, I'm afraid. I paid 60, got about 100 hrs before it turned to shit, and now I'm uninstalling a game which Bethesda claims will be a 10-year service. So no, I'm not doing the wrong thing and letting them win. I'm telling them their service sucks, and that I'm not going to play a game which they said will be managed for 10 years. The mass vacating of players is the best thing that could happen to hurt Bethesda. 
---
Firstly, they're losing revenue by paying for servers that are useless. Second, they've lost so much face you can call them the victims of Ed Gein. Uninstalling is the only option because it deflates their valuation of this piece of shit game.
---
I used to farm Campfire tales, and Path to enlightenment for Acid. Bloodbug proboscis, and firefly abdomens both break down to acid.
---
Charleston fire dept, Penitentiary yard, monorail elevator, and all 3 silos for lead, if you don't feel like farming acid.
---
That‚Äôs why you have pacifist mode in game options
---
Salty!
---
Ammo stocks just plummeted, that I agree with. But I just sold my first 10k+ weapon yesterday. I spend all day vendor hopping trying to spend money, but by the end Im cap tight again.  
---
There seems to have been an influx of spending, which should eventually level out until new weapons and gear come. Probably a good time to fire sale that old stock while its hot, wastelanders should reset everything.
---
Watch the availability of lead.  When you start seeing it in vendors, wrap it up, market is saturated.
---
Funny thing is Outer Worlds has infinitely more appeal to hardcore fallout fans than 76 with such robust features like NPCs and dialogue trees
---
TOW feels like if several games I love had a love-child. It's amazing.
---
You are right, I didn't fall for the Fallout 76 scam.
---
and the 2 month old jet pack bug isn‚Äôt fixed
---
Not sure, haven‚Äôt launched a nuke yet. Didn‚Äôt mean for my comment to disregard just wanted to add it as another possible explanation, I‚Äôm also curious although I‚Äôd be shocked if Bethesda would just straight up lie about this, because the truth of it will come out soon enough
---
We've been married a year this coming December.
---
And that's kinda what we did.  We got engaged back in 2015, planned a wedding... then got stressed out over the ordeal and called it off.  Waited a few years and went down to the courthouse without telling anyone in advance.
---
Screw wedding planning, that's all I have to say üòÇ
---
Congrats to your brother and his husband.  They sound adorable and they definitely saved a fortune $$$
---
:)))
---
Hope you are on PC... will friend you and live in your tent on your private world

Too manny in the past have made faulse clames its hard to beleave anything without proof. And wout have to be a video with no lapses or edits that way we can be shure there is no fukery. As anyone can turn a cam on show scrap in there one moment. Take it out then edit out the part were they pulled there own scrap out.
---
It will certainly change things with the economy, but with the number of players with multiple accounts and apparently unlimited free time I honestly don't expect it to be that bad.
---
That is awesome!  Thanks for sharing.
---
Exactly how I feel. I don't see anything changing in that regard.
---
What‚Äôs the difference with workshop scrap and your own? I did know workshop use another pool?
---
No, you weren't disregarding.  That was a valid observation
---
Frankly, you gotta check out more than just this subreddit. This is being thrashed by the entire gaming industry.
---
Everyone make me feel better and validate my feelings!
---
Someone was salty lol
---
Level 0 you still have to pick, just don't need a perk, but I've never really thought about that lol 
---
If you left unlocked and someone took it you could really mess with them lol, at least until they noticed
---
I just figure some people don't like PvP so I like to point out that if you build within the workshop's scrap capacity (when the numbers are green), you're not really losing anything if someone takes your workshop.
---
Lmao. So childish it to stretch the truth because you can make a real arguement and then personally attack me because you have no real argument. Keep it up kiddo. Doesn't hurt me one bit, or. Bethesda for that matter. Lmao.
---
You can access your scrap, you just can't put more
---
It's been a while since I played New Vegas but wasn't the best version of the riot gear part of the lonesome road dlc? Which we had to pay for? Im legitimately asking i cant quite remember if there was a base model in the game.
---
I would‚Äôve bought a year the minute it was announced if they had just made part that free for everyone. Not doing so made me second guess it and I didn‚Äôt buy. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not alone in that‚Äînot to mention how many people aren‚Äôt buying the game because the public perception is still so negative.
---
Outer Worlds is pretty damn fantastic actually, played it today.
---
I'd be happy, but it's still a long way off. It'll cause me to reinstall the game, that's for sure.
---
Hell Eso makes prequal quest with a neat reward at the end for every content drop xD. 76 just doesn't seem to have a team at all.
---
I love 76 even with all the hate but at this point, i think its impossible for it to become a masterpiece, but i would welcome all the new players
---
I think thousands of upvotes on an articulate post addressing the issues (such as the price compared to other similar services) is non-trivial.
---
If someone makes a valid point, and it gets a lot of upticks, they should absolutely take note.
---
~~Even~~ Especially if it's about making money, they'll make more by paying attention.
---
Technically it's the players fault for buying into it. You should have realised this was going to happen when you bought into something that has almost universal backlash, Bethesda will keep doing this when people keep paying them to do it.
---
When you're building in a workshop and the numbers of scrap required to build something are green, then you'll use the workshop's scrap to build until the numbers turn white.
---
At that point you're using your own scrap
---
Thanks so this place has 3 acid extractors, is this a workshop
---
Your dollar is making them think they can do this, so yes you are the problem. How is it that hard to understand? You buy it and they see that so they will release more paid benefits.
---
Ok thanks man I must be missing some I'll have to check it properly I craft in bulk so when I'm doing the lead run  I'll probably do it bout 20 times so I've kinda got a route I follow on autopilot thanks for the response
---
If that happens I‚Äôll be thrilled. I truly hope that‚Äôs what happens. That‚Äôs the game I‚Äôve wanted all the time I‚Äôve been playing 76. I‚Äôm just not nearly as optimistic as I once was. Priorities seem...off.
---
Why does it actively f*** over others? The stash box is incredibly useful but we‚Äôve managed without it for a year so....
---
"I also appreciate that no corporation will invest money into product  development unless it (and its shareholders) will make a profit. "
---
Factually wrong. Many companies will in fact put money into product development and/or quality assurance when the product is released in a poor state that *the company itself acknowledges for the world to see.*
---
This game has had more than enough reasons for Bethesda to commit to doing right by its customers. Square Enix is an easy example of a gaming company that said "This is below our standards and the money we requested" and focused on dramatically improving the quality of the product before offering it to users again. Even Hello Games spent a while churning out consistent updates without trying to further monetize their game.
---
Bethesda has dragged their feet with recurring bugs, unfixed bugs, delayed content, and an unhealthy focus on monetization. You can defend their practices all you want but you're still serving bullshit like it's common sense at the end of the day.
---
Your personal enjoyment of this game in no way validates your misinformed opinions about how businesses work.
---
Be super happy, I already really enjoy the game so that would just be a huge bonus and kind of a dream come true
---
Now that‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù.  Positively envious of people with skills like that.
---
What do you remote on?
---
I've been using my phone when I'm doing stuff around the house, usually just to keep my vending machines going.  Sadly, no android update to use a Ps4 controller yet for me.
---
Not what I said, I said the customers that you are attacking have nothing wrong them just because they enjoy the game. The people with the problem are those personally attacking strangers literally just for having fun how they choose.
---
Because that's not profitable
---
This doesn't happen when you turn on pacifist. Easy fix.
---
If their employees are taking their stock in lieu of raises... well I can see where the problem is now.
---
But it‚Äôs so much easier to be childish and predictable. Temper tantrums are the best way to solve all the problems. Ranting is well known to be an elegant and concise method for getting your point across. Your talking points become increasingly ironclad the longer they drone on and the more they go off the rails. These are just facts.
---
"Exclusive  content" meaning recycled footage of bugs at launch.  Like that AngryJoe fraudster scumbag.
---
Maybe a separate number or weight cap?  Or a different weight in stash?
---
Yeah there definitely wasn‚Äôt man I remember having to buy the dlc to finally get the ncr ranger gear
---
Yes. No money, no game.
---
 No studio makes a game for the fun of it, it's always been about the money and anybody that says other wise is lying to you, themselves, or both. If a consumer happens to enjoy the product that just means they will buy the next product with little to no effort on the company's end. This little stunt just pointed out that Zenimax sees Fallout as a product and you as a consumer, you're not the only one, and this subreddit isn't even a drop in the bucket of the fallout market. Rage all you want but the standard has been set and nothing short of you making your own game to "keep the purity of games" is gonna change that.
---
Sounds familiar.
---
Right. I don‚Äôt have any information to support or refute schemes. Seems unlikely.
---
Then you must have a pretty boring life to  waste your time roaming reddit threads about a game you hate you hate.
---
It‚Äôs software, the clay never fully hardens so masterworks can always be teased out given time and resources
---
Not for $10
---
the economy is shit already, everyone be selling stuff below the item's in-game value
---
I completely respect your opinion.
---
It's for materials only.
---
I'm not surprised, but for different reasons. MMOs (and yes, I know it's not technically one but looty-shooty still sounds awful to me) typically do not give any fucks about the meta-economy of their games UNLESS they specifically FUBARed something to cause it and that mistake affects gameplay. Even then it's like pulling teeth to get it fixed because they don't think it's a problem until everyone is running the same gear and downing endgame content in seconds. 
---
Every MMO that has experienced some type of currency or item duping problem is still dealing with that problem years later - Everquest, WoW, etc. This only applies when there is player to player trading, so I'm leaving out games like Destiny that have no player economy.
---
Yeah hemlock holes maintenance is in the toxic valley, kind of to the top left, this is an interactive map for fo76
---
https://fo76map.com/
---
Click categories, select hide all, then click where it says workshops, under the locations tab
---
That way you'll be able to see where they all are :)
---
I personally think that the worst offender here in the past 2 days is that BGE fucking sucks at the "bad news sandwich"
---
Whenever you need to tell someone something that they might not like you give them the news in this order
---
Good news ‚Üí Bad news ‚Üí Good news
---
You sandwich the thing that is distasteful or "unwanted" in-between 2 good things to soften the blow-back. This is business management 101 here.
---
If it went,
---
Wastlanders launch (Good) ‚Üí FO 1st (Bad) ‚Üí 1 month free! (Good)
---
or,
---
Some New Event or Content ‚Üí FO 1st ‚Üí Holloween Freebies!
---
People would get mad, but the backlash would have been much less
---
INSTEAD we got,
---
Wastlanders Delayed (Bad) ‚Üí FO 1st (Bad) ‚Üí You're Boon from 1st eats your crap! (Bad)
---
That's a triple layer crap sandwich, and no one wants a triple layer crap sandwich.
---
I picked up FO 1st for a month to see if I liked but I'm not sure if I'll renew, BGE has a huge hole to dig themselve out of over the next 2 or 3 months.
---
Also hire a marketing coordinator for God's sake, you guys need one bad.
---
I agree with this opinion, all you have to do is look at the event update why would they purposely take the events and lock them with a timer where nobody can even find any meaningful events 90% of the time and then on top of that half the event almost never show up even if you wait for hours. It as if some server play these 3 events on a loop and these servers play these event in a loop....What a crock of shit this was all there was for an end game with the exception of activated events like scorched earth or encyptid. When the event system changed I felt I had my answer to what they were doing for sure and that was driving away the player base so they can start their next project. This was a new group of Bethesda employees working on this game and I think when they saw the overwhelming disappointment in the headlines time and time again someone in the teams management/Low level management said that's its we will bleed this games players to death with boredom and P2W features and wash our hands of this mess.
---
Nope
---
If Bethesda fixed the bugs, implemented the QOL changes and delivered great content (things that were promised) then I think more people would buy the game. And if Atom Shop prices were slashed then more people would buy atoms. I played Guild Wars 2 for many years and it did well with a cosmetics-only shop (no subscriptions).
---
Nothing has changed. They are still making money. The people who actually give money to Bethesda are their target audience, not people who want infinite free content without every spending a cent to fund it.
---
&gt;Yes, the sub is good for YOU. But do you realize that there is a movement going on here, where most players are trying to stop publishers from monetizing games?
---
Lmao. More like a bowel movement, because all this is is a self indulgent shit storm by a bunch of entitled millenials. When you do the work that I get my pay from then you get to decide how I spend it, until then, nope. 
---
"Most players"? Reddit is a very tiny subset of the player base. I have no desire to be a part of your I'll conceived "movement". If you don't like what the publisher is doing then don't buy it. Better yet, design, develope and code your own game. Either way stop trying to tell others what they should be doing or what they should be enjoying. Everyone will be happier, including you, once you stop trying to run everyone else's life and take care of your own
---
TLDR Fallout 76 not as bad as everyone makes out. First not as big an issue as everyone makes out.
---
Of course they are in it for the money. Every game developer is in it for the money. What is different is the quality. Bethesda use to have a name that inspired hope in the games they released. You could trust them at their word when they made statements. That is no longer true.
---
I understand your opinion, but maybe they shouldn't have released a game that was such a disaster. Maybe then the player base would have been large enough that made selling cosmetics a viable option for revenue.
---
They didn't do that though so now they are asking players to subsidized their game by giving players what they have wanted for a monthly fee. They want us to bail them out of their mess that they created. Sorry, I am not buying. It's your money so you are free to do with it as you please.  I just feel that is rewarding failure and setting a bad precedent.
---
Those days never existed as mainstream, and yet they do still exist outside of the mainstream. 
---
Right now you're just playing a game by a major company that's owned by a major company, and they're doing their best to charge you top tier pricing for a bottom tier product. And you think that's ok because you like the product. 
---
And in a sense, yea, it's ok. Just don't spread too much misinformation about how this is just the way it is now...
---
Maybe try moving to a new area? Certain areas of the map are catered to corresponding level ranges. There's a map somewhere that has it all dilineated.
---
i agree with what you‚Äôre saying, except the hunger/food, item degradation, and crafting parts. Those parts are kinda essential to a ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù game. you‚Äôre practically asking to play in easy mode, in an already easy game.
---
As an ocean you are
---
Nope. A, thats ES**Q**, B its a reference to MXC.
---
I fucking hate MMOs
---
There is nothing wrong with capitalism.
---
Fact is we don't own fallout and while it's nice when they listen to us, they don't have to. Clearly there are people who like this or they wouldn't be buying it. 
---
Those of us who don't like it are free to buy something else, support developers we do like. 
---
And at the end of the day classic Bethesda games have great replay value and they can't take that away from us.
---
I don't even want to think about it. I try to remain a little optimistic that Bethesda will learn from this and get better by the time they release the next ES, naively maybe, but that's all I have now.
---
Why did they shut all servers down, when issue is on private ones?
---
It's pay-to-win and you get the opportunity to spend $160 for the "finished" game that isn't even working! Bethesda is truly a shit-show right now.
---
I'm sorry you took the bullet man.
---
the worst part is that NOW, even if they do give us a good will release, it will feel like they are just scrambling to smooth things over, instead of actually deserving goodwill.
---
like, if they released an ammo converter *today* and it was *free*, just straight up given to us like the terminal was, it wouldnt even come close to making things right, let alone making everyone happy with them
---
Bethesda promised there was no additional cost after you bought the game except for cosmetics. Then they take community feedback to implement new features and charge for those.
---
They add bonus atoms to the monthly subscription to make it seem like a 'worth it' purchase. These atoms don't cost anything for Bethesda and might be used to buy cosmetics or more utility, which was also added to the atoms shop. So really just some extra items disguised as atoms so people can easily calculate their "worth" and think everything else in the subscription is basically free!
---
All the while wastelanders and game improvements are delayed while Fallout 1st subscribers can at least buy a reportedly less laggy game.
---
So all in all: If you bought the game, yes, you can play it for free. But it is less convenient and seemingly a lesser version as with the additional subscription. People who might have paid 60$ for FO76 maybe expected not to have to pay another 13$ per month but rather a complete game. (BTW, this is my outside feeling, since I never bought FO76 after its release and just got more and more repulsed by Bethesda).
---
I paid 12k for my Bloodied 1\* handmade from a player vendor, the best caps I've ever spent.
---
Uninstalling is the only way they'll get the message.
---
I completely agree. They really need to employ some new PR staff. I can't really defend Bethesdas handling of many of the issues.
---
Heck, somebody flew a plane into their building a decade ago.
---
Get rid of that crappy mutation, at best it can kill a rad roach, at worst it can get your camp destroyed.
---
I am ashamed that the Sack Hood does not count. I mean come on! Sack hood + Bloody Chef Outfit!
---
In the future, wait 48 hrs after a big update
---
First fire of that engine in several years. Still ironing out some carb issues....it refuses to idle below 5k rpm(should be literally half that) and sometimes dies when throttling up. I'll get there, though, I've revived engines that were totally siezed and gotten them airworthy again.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtGYh5ycNDg This is one of those engines
---
I wish there was a way to get more atoms. After doing most of the challenges, I am running out of stuff. I log on for The same reason as you. Only 4000 pieces of wood left too I can get those atoms ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
I'm just copy/pasting a hater's behavior to a father of a household. No logic involved. Those two are doing exactly the same thing. Have no idea why you are so triggered.
---
I would beg to differ. I think people who got the game at $60, $20, or free were expecting this game to be continually updated and at a point where they felt listened to. Bethesda, not the gamers, are the ones who promised no DLC - so you can't really blame anyone here for not wanting to shell out extra money for extra content. Perhaps if the $100 subscription had value, dedicated servers, other features, then this would be different. As is stands, from everyone I've spoken to, this was the final nail in the coffin. Plenty of other games to play.
---
Not much way around it other than to grind your way higher. You get caught in a grey area for a while where you're too strong for the forest but quite not strong enough for the other regions without a little help. I play 99% solo and spent a lot of time taking/defending workshops to grind from 20-30ish.
---
Right, the people who play the game are the problem, not Bethesda
---
You're a pathetic bootlicker lmao
---
Pretty sure they don‚Äôt want to start running different code between the two
---
I uninstalled the other day, downloaded CoD WW2 and apex. Game was fun but it seems I have nothing left to do in this game. Maybe on wastlanders  release I‚Äôll come back and give it another try. Being delayed I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôll be a massive expansion
---
They already have your money and they know in the future uninformed people will still buy their products. Unfortunately, they don't care.
---
It's not about validation, it's about sending a message. Obviously.
---
This is what we call a *strawman*.
---
But if it was in atom shop you‚Äôd get üôÑ
---
I'm snagging the Riot Armor variant. If it is in the Atom Shop my buddies will certainly be happy.
---
Keep doing side quests, it's kinda a grind for awhile in there. You could play some Nuclear Winter too gain some extra levels as well
---
It really doesn't.
---
FFXIV Doesn't have a free option, so you have no choice but to buy the game, buy the expansion, and buy the subscription. There's also microtransactions to move servers (because choosing servers is amazingly still a thing in Square Enix games), for cosmetic items, to change character appearance, etc... with no opportunity to accumulate this currency in game. 
---
There are tons of ways to give Square Enix your money with FFXIV. The difference is that FFXIV is significantly less buggy and the content is solid, so people give it a pass. Server stability is frustrating. You're not booted much, but lag is real.
---
That doesn't make sense to me. 
---
If it does indeed go for 10 years, and you've taken 100 hours off that...there is a large amount of un-played (but paid for) hours left on the table. Albeit small, its still a value. As far as we know about the servers, they claim to bring them up/down as necessary, though I'm not all that familiar with AWS and if there is a rate difference for something barely being utilized versus one that is. 
---
Sure a mass exodus of players will hurt any game, but truth is we don't even know the amount in the player base. Handful of angry people posting "I'm quitting" letters to BGS on the internet is indicative of something...but we can't say its accurate in any way. 
---
As I've mentioned in this sub before, people who are happy with the game are very unlikely to come post about it. Those who aren't are very likely to find an outlet for their anger. It turns one sided real quick, throwing any semblance of accurate representation right out. 
---
Doesn't bother me, do what you feel is necessary. At least you haven't taken to calling the people staying silly names and the like. Do I agree with BGS's actions? Nope, they've bodged quite a bit from day one. Am I going to stop my occasional signing on to enjoy something I paid for? Nope.
---
nevermind entirely missed the point of your comment, oops
---
But it'd be some good PR for once... don't know if Bethesda even remembers what that is.
---
despite all of the terrible press, when i saw that they had lowered the weights/camp budgeting for bobbleheads and magazines, i was VERY HAPPY.   I'm trying to display every magazine (already have all the bobbleheads), but ofcourse i cant, because my house budget is full.  finally being able to put the last like 10 magazines on the rack made my day.
---
then low and behold, the budget amount was not affected......   still cant add them :(
---
Lol right
---
I bought it for my wife and she loves it too, glad your enjoying it! Def has some NV vibes / firefly !! Soundtrack is amazing !
---
https://bethesda.net/en/dashboard
---
Have you ever thought to go to Bethesda's official site, or do a google search?
---
Hey, I don't disagree it'd be an outstanding move.
---
But I would be extremely surprised if it happened.
---
yep. giver
---
This is exactly my experience. My first nuke on a private world was at Whitespring and half the ghouls were already dead. Not certain if it was a bug or what but it was definitely very disappointing
---
You would probably like it, but that‚Äôs not saying much.
---
I just don‚Äôt get it. Life is not fair. I am in a wheelchair. I play 14 hours a day if you count reddit. I would pay 20.00 a month to keep the lights on and have new content.  Let‚Äôs give the game some props and yes I know the probs. I played the beta to. Let‚Äôs talk about the real game fan base. Old white dudes who can afford it. Who buy stuff on eBay and Gameflip. It‚Äôs about how you want to spend your time. It‚Äôs all pay to play. How much to pay is your choice. If you don‚Äôt want to play or pay go get a job.or play something else.  That leaves those who can afford it and those who maybe escape the days grind with a totally immersive video game. Yes the system is broke. Trump is in the White House but oh my god you have pay for a video game?
---
I came here to answer questions. 
---
I cant help it if the swine dont like the answers.
---
I know I‚Äôll redownload for wastelanders, just run out of things to do until then. Going back to FO NV for some lit dlc runthroughs. I don‚Äôt think any FO game will be better than NV in my mind.
---
I definitely think so I've gotten so much enjoyment out of the game I'm also someone that doesnt play it more than 10 hours a week some of the guys that play it ton got tired of it after a couple months
---
Every instrument plays its own piece of the same song. If you get all the instruments playing at once they all jam out like one big band. I think the song is an Fo76 original
---
Would be cool but then you‚Äôd either have to expand stash to all characters combined or reduce total stash size overall
---
Anyone else excited for the short suit? Lol, maybe I'm the only one. That's cool.
---
I just go after supermutants a lot of them drop gunpowder.
---
I know we've been begging for NPCs for ages but this is not what we had in mind.
---
I want to throw food at people though.
---
I hardly ever run into anyone.
---
I'm confused, I checked Steam and it said the game wouldn't be out until 2020, then I checked there website and it only gave the option to preorder. I thought this game was out?
---
People like you are why Fallout 76 and the AAA gaming industry as a whole progressively keeps getting worse. We're on our way towards the second video games crash. And I suspect this one will be worse than the  one in '83. 
---
Come to think of it, Fallout 76 has a lot in common with the 1982 ET game. A rushed game, full of bugs, zero polish and poor quality. They also shipped millions of copies thinking the game would sell based on the name. But instead of burying 2 millions ET cartridges in the desert, stores were giving Fallout 76 copies away with literally every other item, mere weeks after launch.
---
Who knows, in the near future Fallout 76 may well be considered the catalyst that caused the 2020's video game crash.
---
Ouch... fair point
---
I should not have said "no corporation"...
---
Square Enix and Rockstar would indeed prove me wrong.  Also No Man's Sky...
---
I am not a game expert nor a game critic.  I am enjoying FO76 even in the state it was and in the state it is now.  In my opinion, destructive lashing out at the developer and the team will not improve the product.
---
PS.  I may not know much about games... but I do know about how businesses work.
---
Jetpacking, bouncing off a trampoline, fired out of a cannon. They're all good. Personally, I imagine Hines moonwalking with both middle fingers in the air. Like he's just taunting us all with his dickery.
---
Yup.  Still happening.  Not only that, but there's a ton of other bugs that weren't resolved, came back, or are new.  Jetpacks are fucked.  Nuke circle with larger outer circle on map.  Artillery Grenades didn't transfer.  I'm sure there's more, that's just what I noticed last night.
---
The issue isn't limited to private servers. The scrapbox "can be used in both public and private worlds." 
---
 [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5OZH9xTsc8DNuEN539nN6y/fallout-76-update-14-patch-notes-october-23-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5OZH9xTsc8DNuEN539nN6y/fallout-76-update-14-patch-notes-october-23-2019)
---
Yes, it is very much still worth it.
---
The main 2 things I have against it is:
---
1.  They specifically stated that down the line ~1 year or so they would release private servers, and allow modding.  Not one have they not done that, but you need a subscription to get a private server.  This would have been 100% better if they released private servers, where you can pay for subscription to rent one of their hosted private servers, but give players an option to run their own server for free.
---
2.  They have been working stash space and saying it was borderline impossible to deal with storage space.  The fact that paying 12$ a month magically makes server performance issues due to stash non-existent means they have been lying to us the entire time.  One of the main reasons I stopped playing fallout 76 before was that I never felt like I was getting "better or more rich"  Fallout has always been about collecting, and becoming a stronger more power force and presence in the world.  By always trading out items for new items, you never got the option to collect even 1 of every gun.
---
Ya it will save me money next month buying the subscription because for this last yr i been spending 200,00 a month just on atoms..
---
Why stop at food?
---
I am on PC, actually. I‚Äôm going to fly my tent to the moon tonight, paint it pink and draw a Lenin face with No Bark Noonan. 
---
 I‚Äôll show how the robot dance emote converts all of Watoga into a private army and kills the SBQ for you. They all turn legendary afterwards and die for your pleasure.  It‚Äôs the ‚Äúgame recognize game‚Äù extra secret p2w feature that Bethesda doesn‚Äôt want you to know about!
---
Seriously though, send me a DM with your IGN if you like.
---
I got at least one month of it. Found myself going out of my way to help more new players. Handed out level 1 hazmat suits, radaway, stimpacks, purified water, vegetarian ham, canned coffee, and canned dog food to about twenty new players now. Gotta say, I kind of wish I could set up a booth up by the vault entrance and hand out the resources in a more formal manner. Even been making some rather decent weapons for the new players.
---
It's out now on Epic Store and Microsoft Store. Yes, it's included in Xbox Game Pass.
---
Steam is a year later.
---
For me its more of how much resources is Beth spending on Fallout First, just like we questioned NW. The base game needs many quality of life improvements and more content which has been slow to materialize. I just don't want to see them keep dividing their resources into different areas until Adventure mode is up to the communities expectations.

Get to the Whitesprings, use the robots to take out the mobs. Pop them with one or two rounds get them following and lead them right to the robots. You dont need to kill them just shot each one once find a safe place to take the occasional pop shot with VATS and watch the xp roll in as level 60+ ghouls drop
---
Free content for a full year is more than worth 60 bucks. At least 30 people on my friends list have bought it so I'm pretty sure it was a success. Even tons of randoms I've run into are using the armor or icon.
---
Well said... and proven true by our children
---
Well my thoughts on the for every one thing is I feel it should be a carried item (with weight) that you temporarily set up at locations. Wouldn't be sure on a time limit but not only would it be a small space thing, it would also just get tossed back at your inventory if some ones camp spawned in.
---
Oh. Well my interest just dropped to 0
---
There are no private servers.  They create a new world for someone when a subscriber enters a private game, but it's on the same servers as everyone else.  It's only 'private' in that you control, to some extent, who can get on the same world as you.
---
There is some question as to whether or not a new 'world' is actually created, though I haven't heard enough to know for sure whether this is an issue or not.
---
Do you guys just call anyone who doesn't agree with your bitching and whining bootlickers and fanboys?   
---
No wonder that sub exists, people probably don't want to wake up and see a toxic shithole like this subreddit calling people names for continuing to enjoy and play something you don't want to see them enjoy.
---
Oh I'm aware. Google News is not dropping the ball there. 
---
But when half of these outlets are just copy posts from reddit, how is it any different?
---
I will point my finger at all the haters who have been trashing the game for the last week and say, "I told you so".
---
This is Fallout. We can stain the wasteland with each others blood. Lol
---
lol right after I primed my rifle and made 3,000 rounds for it :(
---
I believe this is the one you're mentioning: [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/11/60ca88de-790x812.png](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2018/11/60ca88de-790x812.png) \- Keep in mind that while enemy level is important, certain \*types\* are just tougher in general. High level scorched aren't an especially huge deal, whereas anglers and mirelurk kings of any level can be huge pains in the ass. 
---
OP - Unlike a lot of games, usually the best way to level in the Fallout series isn't by killing a bunch of enemies. Until you get later in the game, they give somewhat minimal amounts. You're better off completing story quests and recurring events. Even lower level ones like Fertile Soil, you get stimpacks and other useful items. This is also a good place to "meet" higher level players. If you have a mic, most of them -are- friendly, and don't mind tagging along to help you out with some of the quests.
---
And if i wanna hurt someone? ;)
---
Good, that subreddits doing just fine without all the toxicity.
---
I say the same since Fallout 1st was dropped and yet I received tons of downvotes.  
---
Caps will be even more worthless and 5.56 can be crafted in abundance to be a viable suplementary currency.
---
You could take these inconveniences away from every player to enhance the game itself. But what would you charge for, then?
---
So far it's pretty great. Not seeing my character ever except arms (only my body and face if I go idle, and also in the inventory menu), is a let down. But it's got the RPG of New Vegas, with tighter gunplay and it looks gorgeous. Also amazingly bug free so far.
---
The exploration is really fun and you'll probably meet some great people, but like everything else in life, you'll come across some assholes every now and then.
---
It makes vault raids bearable
---
The point is they promised only cosmetic items in the atomic shop and they deliberately went back on their word. The fridge and the junk bot should *not* be atomic ship items unless they‚Äôre just paint jobs. There‚Äôs no other way to acquire these plans either, so you‚Äôre SOL
---
I cant discuss that on the internet.
---
You can get fresh server even in Adventure mode. It just takes a lot of jumping.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paragraph
---
Neither are circle jerks imho. It's all just fans of the same game writing their opinions.
---
Hardcore mode. We throw chairs or we riot.
---
of course its not related, for that, The outer worlds would need to scam their players, so...I think we get it ;)
---
Capitalism without regulation is never sustainable. If will always implode on itself over time. Capitalism at a certain point becomes a detriment on its consumers which is where Bethesda is now. If they don't change course to a good for everybody approach they will fail as a business.
---
My example for capitalism is the villages in Chile who have no water to drink. As the business bought all the water rights from the rivers to water their farms for export and money.
---
They don't want r/fo76FilthyCasuals turning into this mosh pit
---
I *think* we're agreeing, with a bit of miscommunication in between us.  
---
However, if you think this subreddit is the only discord currently happening, then you need to step outside the bubble and check out the reactions from around the industry. It's getting thrashed. They won't make money off this subscription, it will fail, and they will not regain face until they do something for the community instead of treating it like a cash cow. Bethesda had good faith for years. They destroyed it in LESS THAN A YEAR.
---
Both very good points and ones that admittedly I had forgotten about. However I do still feel that the positives outweigh the negatives - for me at least.
---
How is the looting? Seeing how nobody can hit those spots first, are you running into more legendaries and finding more magazines bobbleheads and rare outfits easier
---
They‚Äôre connected.
---
I sat on the fence for months and finally bought it last April. Its the only game I've played since. Had I listened to the negativity of certain groups I would've deprived myself of a lot of entertainment.
---
Nicely done! I wasn't aware of that location either i'll have to head back to Hopewell and go find it!
---
I thought the white part was a funny looking cat painted on a stalactite at first.
---
Stretch the truth -- Beth made it perfectly clear pre-release that only cosmetic content would be sold, and all major new features and patches would be free.
---
Real argument -- like the one you made before calling this guy malicious? Oh wait you didn't.
---
Personal attack -- oh like you called this guy personally malicious for asking a question? And pretty much everyone else criticizing Bethesda, who you immediately denounce as toxic people?
---
You clearly have the high ground here. Keep on condescending.
---
never said i didnt believe that, but i also watched gameplay of outer worlds and made my own decision not based on hype. fo76 fans sadly fell to that cliche. if a game is cheap and it looks fun to me ill look into it, and only after my own views will i buy it, i dont pre order anything, it just incentivizes game devs to cheap out after seeing what trailers and hype bring in. they dont see any reason to keep perfecting their craft.
---
Oh, well just happened again.  
---
Time to Nuke Grafton
---
Forbes mentioned that people can join recent players private worlds, I assumed there would be troll squads coming through lol
---
If the offender is wanted.. it's been reported to still work.  :(
---
I'm never parted with my money. I pay when I want to pay for things. Personally I didn't even lay for this game. I traded another game for it. 
---
Dont personally come at me, thanks.
---
No lol
---
Thank you for your advice. I was doing quests for awhile, but at about level 20 they started taking me into some areas with really high level mobs. I'm not a very good player unfortunately.
---
Seneca Rocks can be nuked.
---
Ugh, how sad
---
Im guessing its better with friends
---
Also, I was referring to the amount\* of money the OP specified. Which is ridiculous. 
---
OF course business is about money Frosh.
---
But the community is revolting. And that is worth more than money.
---
this is not a democracy, this is not a government run entity, it is a private sub,
---
The moderators make the rules, not society.
---
If they think you broke the rules, you get removed. 
---
Please see rules 4 and 5.
---
I have had posts removed for these in the past as well. 
---
You know what I did?  I stopped breaking the rules.
---
Tell your friends to be more civil and stop calling people names and being down right vulgar at times.
---
Look man, this ain‚Äôt exactly a topic that can be tackled in 3-4 sentences lol but you did get a laugh from me so upvoted
---
No one deserves to be harassed over their decisions. 
---
In a discussion where people enter to exchange opinions, questioning and challenging opinions with civility is to be expected. Attacking people viciously and relentlessly over every medium you can find though isn't the way to produce any meaningful change.
---
Why the fuck would you buy 4 copies of a shitty game like fo76? lol
---
I'm not paying it. Did that fix the situation? No.
---
Ok. "Give me my acid back!"
---
Then perhaps they shouldn't have promised free content for the life of the game. You have 30 friends bought this extra $13-$100 DLC?
---
Since no one has looted anything yes I am overflowing with items. I am very happy with my purchase so far. 
---
The portable tent is a life saver
---
My viewpoint is a little skewed because I can leave my phone on my desk at work and remote in - on a private server all I really have to worry about are roaming mobs and the defense events. Even with those, without any players to take the factories from me I have plenty of time and now resources to build solid, automated defenses in just a few minutes. Other players will figure out ways to do that as well. :-/
---
Lol, I'm part of the problem because we have different opinions on a video game?
---
I still find it fun to play.
---
Awareness is worth PR value. It doesn't make it any less valuable. It's a bad, bad look for Bethesda
---
Nobodies forcing you to pay the subscription.
---
Money makes people find a way
---
With attitudes like yours I'm reconsidering my position. Maybe it's not so bad that companies get players like you to pay more for playing games.
---
Enjoy this ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù while it lasts.
---
So is microsoft and sony also monopoly?
---
Also they dont ban anyone from selling on other platforms.
---
They just make a deal that we pay you x amount for exclusivity.
---
Also its still a fucking launcher who gives a rats ass
---
it‚Äôs clear bethesda thinks this community is  comprised entirely of suckers. and if you subscribe to this latest  abomination , you‚Äôll be proving them right
---
$12 is not anywhere near overpriced.
---
What do you want? A cookie?
---
It's the digital equivalent of throwing paint on someone wearing a fur coat. 
---
The owner of a fine fur coat thinks it's a status symbol to wear out in public, and either doesn't care about the implications of ownership or supports the industry behind procuring one.  Somewhere, someone is incensed by indifference toward and/or support of an industry that killed the animal being worn... so, paint happens.
---
The owner of iconic Ranger Armor similarly thinks it's a status symbol to wear out in public, and either doesn't care about the implications of ownership or supports the industry behind procuring one.  Somewhere, someone is incensed by indifference toward and/or support of a company that continues to break promises made to its customers to further nickel and dime them, all while repeatedly releasing inexcusably buggy, incomplete software... thus angry text messages and reddit comments.
---
The actions of those incensed are almost certainly disproportional, but wearing Ranger Armor on a public server is a bit out of touch with where the community sentiment is currently... and probably not the status symbol you might otherwise think it to be.  Like the famed monocle of EvE Online's "Monocle Gate" episode, however, it probably makes for excellent trolling attire.
---
You have Responders, BOS, Free States, raiders, scouts, enclave, Fallout Firsters... They are called factions. They can't do things together. 
---
God, I hate those Firsters. I would PvP the fuck out of them if they hadn't run away to their private servers.
---
A man of culture I see. bravo
---
any issues with the scrapbox yet?
---
I lost over 4k flux
---
Tim Willits is gone, he left a month or two ago and is now working for Saber.
---
Good job getting to 200!
---
I think its a good idea. Good to have private servers good to have exclusive outfit each month and good to give atoms as well its all worth the money.     
---
Whats not good is not giving scrapbox to everyone.    And the tent should be in the atom shop right next to fridge and collectron.   That is the only way it should have went.    If scrapbox was free  the bad shit they got would be waaaaayyy less.    The bad press cant be undone at this point.   Still give everyone scrapbox bethesda.
---
If you say something and then a year later find out you cant do it then it was a lie it was a mistake. All dlc is still free like they promised. Technically 1st isn't bought through the arom shop either.
---
Is that all Amazon charges?  (they're definitely using AWS)
---
&gt;Honesty  I attempted to play last night for about 20 minutes.  Just to see how many people actually bought the paid service. I counted 7 on the server i was on. Before i logged off Ended up talking with one guy. Really nice guy so i got nothing against him but he told me the whole reason he paid for the service is the ranger armor and the atoms.
---
The anger you have is obvious, but the combined sentences do imply you asking about it. That technicality aside, my point still stands. But either way, have a nice day!
---
I'm level 125 and I've played it about 99% solo. I teamed up a little bit earlier on in the game to get some help but I still like doing things by myself at my own pace. Aside from fighting the queen you can play the game solo no prob.
---
Thanks so much :P it was a grind but had a blast the whole way
---
No one actually owns a server
---
They give it to you. All you have to do is play their game and start looting. Magic.
---
And you can't jump in private, nor can you vend to other players sooooo.... its really not that big of an advantage. Sad everyone got their panties in a bunch over it, because the game has been more fun then anytime I've since I started playing it. I play with my GF and basically no one wants to try to gank a group of players, so we can have all the workshops in advanture we want anyway... literally nothing changes for me, except now there are less bugs and schorchbeasts drop legendaries.
---
I got both the PA edition of 76 and the Anthem special edition. So much money down the shitter.
---
I‚Äôm at 40, I like the heavy guns like the .50
---
Basically the entire Fallout fandom is a New Vegas circle jerk unfortunately
---
You on xbox? We can do this. I don't count PvP as uncivil.
---
I‚Äôm not sure how solid this argument is
---
I'm no one's mark...I did this on porpoise.
---
Don't be afraid to run and to come back to a quest later! Or, to run into an area, grab the item you need, and then run out. Because of the open-ended nature of FO76, it's pretty easy to wander into tough areas, especially since enemy levels are "set" by the first player in there during a session. 
---
At your level, try exploring as much of the left and north side of the map that you can. While the story missions take you to the right, there are plenty of locations and smaller missions to discover on the left-hand side. For example, I don't think the story takes you to Camden Park, but there is a bunch of useful stuff in there - aluminum cans, easy to kill scorched, a couple fusion generators you can loot, and three daily quests that are super easy.
---
Why? The sub is for hardcore fans as the armor.
---
Then as I said in my first comment...you should not own a computer, XBOX or PS4...they all cost money, XBOXLIVE, internet, etc....If you cannot afford $12 then maybe your priorities are out of order....
---
You emerge from a vault... have a vague story to follow... ignore story and explore the world... recycling scrap... improve gear... follow some of the story... kill a bunch of stuff... build some cool camps... bit more story you stumbled into... become an overpowered monster... finish story... kill more shit until you get bored and move on to another game.
---
In 76, the NPC dialogue stuff is replaced with an intentionally empty world that still has a deep story just without factions and choices... but it adds the ability to play with friends, player vending, group bosses, etc. opening up a world of actual role-playing.  A bit less scripted RPG and a bit more "make your own RPG".   Otherwise it is at it's core, Fallout.  Other Fallout games take this core and tell a limited linear story on top of it... where 76's story is more long-term and open-ended, and we're still in Act 1.
---
Right but wouldn't it be nice if you didn't have to pay them even more money just to be able to play the way you like? Wouldn't it be nice to give money to a company that at least feigns respect for its customers?
---
I love the game too but I don't feel like its worth being spat on.
---
Now if I can just get Rose to shut the hell up on every login with my alt melee character...
---
That‚Äôs stated very clearly on the page. No need for a PSA.
---
The fact that people defended and played this game for a whole year after launch is truly mind boggling.
---
Sorry, but I feel like you're part of the problem. I'm not going to harass you, or insult you, but I think you're the reason that Bethesda is going to keep doing this. I'm dipping out of the game because I've lost all hope in it. People that continue to pay Bethesda to do this kind of shit are letting them know it's OK because: *Who cares? The playerbase will just keep paying us anyway!*
---
" Bethesda surely can't keep giving new content for free if they haven't got money coming in to make it.  "
---
This is exactly what they said they would do though. 
---
And man Im glad you have had barely any crashes. There were singular nights where I'd have a half dozen disconnects before I just turned the game off for the evening.
---
I agree the exclusive stuff isn't major, and the semi-cosmetic stuff in the shop with low functionality, fridge and robots, and autoscrappers, but it's just the start ;) give em a chance to slowly increase what youll have to pay for.
---
But yeah, to each their own. Lies, gouging and a bugged out game aren't for me.
---
They're not concerned about the future of 76. You people are gonna buy the next one anyway.
---
Exactly - they were expecting 10 years of play time. I stopped after a normal AAA game (100 hours roughly). I got my value out of it. Bethesda is expecting people to play for 10 years. 100 hours is well short of that mark, and by uninstalling it, it shows them there is no inherent value beyong what they've already done. Now, in desperation, they've decided to launch a version of the game which should have existed from the start.
---
And they're making people pay EVEN MORE MONEY to access it. It's appalling. This reeks of desperation. It's sad, and it's a sign of ultimate, impending failure. Bethesda has a lot of work to do in order to regain the confidence of the fans that made it one of the most heralded developers in the world. Zenimax absolutely is behind this. I said that a few months back and got roasted.
---
They're attempting to bloat their asset value because they're looking for new VC's to invest so they can update the engine for the next generation of consoles. This is bullshit. This isn't the way to do it. They lied hand over fist, time and again to the consumers who stood by this game from BETA to the moment they uninstalled it.
---
Out of curiousity, which ones?  (same same here, btw)
---
I'd say just a loot and shoot with a short story and a brutal RNG grind.
---
You‚Äôre right lmao
---
They're two different games designed for two different audiences.  Obsidian literally had to make a public statement months back asking people to stop shitting on Bethesda and 76 after everyone started praising Outer Worlds and how it was going to be the game Fallout games should be.
---
Okay... bye I guess?  Good luck?
---
I expect you back in game next week then?  Same time, same place?
---
I have a hard time believing *anything* is going to improve the product very much now. I would love if that happened though because that's how everyone wins. Bethesda fixes the game that was billed as a triple-A, 'future updates for free' good time for you and the friends.
---
But Bethesda have really put their ass in the fire by trying to squeeze more and more money out of players without actually delivering on promised content and promised philosophies first. 
---
That said, I think you should enjoy the game as much as you want, other people's opinions of it or you don't matter. I see nothing wrong with having fun with 76 and wanting it to succeed. As long as Bethesda gets the criticism they deserve for being so awfully greedy since Creation Club because I believe in a form of karma.
---
&gt; a small number of players have in fact experienced a loss of scrap items after placing them into the Scrap Box 
---
Well yeah. That small number being the people who actually decided to bite the bullet and buy the subscription.
---
Not the right wording but  they should have   regular world and 50plus world.    Because right now half the map is not playable since its all lower tha  50
---
To zenimax*
---
great, here comes the "I'm being oppressed" horseshit.....
---
Couldn't it also mean these people liked the game and want it to be better? The game **was** false advertised by this point and that **IS** something everyone should be making noise about. Because enjoying the game regardless or not, these types of things are going to impact you when the player base is quickly disappearing and Bethesda is shoveling all the content behind a paywall. 
---
Despite what has been gradually forced to be accepted by dumb consumers, these games don't need micropayments to sustain themselves. It wasn't that long ago where this wasn't even a thing.
---
Thanks mate
---
I think we are really talking about class structure . I am having a great time fighting over pennies a day. Adapt and overcome. If someone made an equivalent game platform I might go. It would cost to. If I left it would be due to stability of gameplay. Why should it be fair? Go kill things with a rock if you want to play, if you want to kill things with a gold bloodied explosive handmade with 33 %Vats that is a personal decision and it takes money. Just like 22‚Äôs on a minivan
---
Every tin can is one lead and one steel.
---
I agree with you. There‚Äôs some toxicity, but I really do seem to remember a surprising amount of positivity and encouragement.
---
Yes. Unfortunately , I gave up a lot of my life waiting for those games to get to the good parts. Really I should've learned to stick to a 2 hour rule after FFXIII...
---
Pvp shovels only..... ;)
---
If I don't die of shock I'll probably pick it up again.
---
They are not omniscient.  The game could‚Äôve been much better.
---
Sometime ago I read an interview with a game Developer (think it was Massive).   They said that a great way to approach game development would be to announce a game well in advance, read fans‚Äô thoughts, expectations, speculations and ideas and deliver what was asked.  :) That would be ingenious.
---
Unfortunately, that‚Äôs not what we have with FO76. 
---
The point I am trying to make is that the players and fans of Fallout should not be destructive in their criticism.
---
It's sad that in a games specific sub you have to start with 'now don't shoot me in the head', cause the people who dislike the game won't leave the sub ha
---
I just hope this means the game bubble will pop again and we can get good games again. Video games are to mainstream now.
---
I can understand your point of view, having been in a similar situation sticking with a MMO as they indulged in the pig-fuckery that is the Live Service death spiral. By the same virtue of having been through that I don't necessarily agree with you because I've watched well intentioned people like yourself continually get taken advantage of and their good will abused. I believe a concept which should've been a knock out of the park -- FO MMO servers have been small community gems in the years before this -- was ultimately ruined beyond redemption by their naked attempts at chasing the same profits they enviously watched GTA:O gain. 
---
I don't think you're stupid or naive, OP. Keep up the good fight to get the game you want to play fixed in a way that's best for you. In that, we agree and have a common ground. Good luck to you and those like you.
---
Bethesda should be ashamed and more importantly their investors should be _very_ concerned about their financial future if they continue down this path.
---
Or misplaced loyalty. Some people will purchase in defense of Bethesda as they feel it's their "team". Outerworlds kind of knocks on the idea that people become dedicated to corporate entities. 
---
Or someone really likes fo76 and they have the money and feel it's a deal. If they do it's their money and good for them I suppose.
---
I think the game has plenty to offer especially at 20 bucks. 
---
There are some bugs and glitches but so far nothing that made my experience a unpleasant one.
---
I do understand people are angry because of the stashbox beeing locked behind a paywal, but honestly if you enjoy the game i don't really see fallout 1st as a bad idea especially at the 15 euro price point that includes 1650 atoms (so that kind of justify the price by itself. 
---
Im pretty nautral about the whole thing, i understand two sides but i'm not gonna part with any of them., i'll just play and have fun and let others sort it out.
---
Lol yeah, being an adult is scamming yourself out of $100 so you can show off a costume and emote to the children playing this broken video game with you
---
\^ THIS.  They already have my shekels, and should give me something for it.
---
Frankly I‚Äôm surprised it hasn‚Äôt happened already...
---
Well there is one other possible bright point, crafting could almost be a viable leveling path for a Pacifist with resources no longer being a bottleneck. Vault Dweller CarpalTunnel, reporting for duty!
---
Oh watch these dipshits, they‚Äôre twisting it
---
I'm not going to sit here and ruin something you enjoy. However, I do understand why some people may have an issue with others who purchase it. It's similar to the person who buys 1,000 lootboxes, when everyone is complaining that its predatory. Or throwing a cigarette out of your car after smoking, and thinking, who cares, what damage can one person do. Or even say not getting vaccinated, and thinking, my body my rules. Yet, every example as an adverse effect. Fallout is going to milk this game dry without making it a better game, the cigarette will slowly destroy the environment , and not getting vaccinated puts everyone at risk. I'm aware my examples are extreme, but at the end of the day, I can understand your side of enjoying the game and feeling no issue giving them more money, but I can also see how people who enjoy the Fallout universe were hoping to get more without having to spend more, given the state of the game on release and throughout. Anyone who pays simply supports this predatory behavior. Every wallet matters.
---
Have they REALLY been that anti consumer though?  Even compared to all of the other game publishers that pile on loot boxes and paid dlc and lock actual entire features behind pay walls... all Bethesda has done is sell some items that accomplish what you can already do in the game with a bit more convenience.  Nothing Bethesda has tried to sell to people is a mandatory purchase.
---
That‚Äôs an interesting perspective. I kind of do enjoy the disparity in skill levels; it adds a new level of challenge and fun to the game!
---
To play completely solo in a world by yourself as he asked, you do have to pay for first.
---
yes the games a ton of fun
---
Yeah!
---
I don't think you perceive the very real problem.
---
you on ps4?
---
Goes into private sub 
---
Breaks the easy to read rules of said sub

FREEEZE PEEEEACH
---
Are they though? I dont like jumping on the hate bandwagon but they are making terrible decisions resulting in predictable negative feedback. And this isn't a case of "can't make everyone happy" For example a week or so ago I traded for a BE tesla. I was thrilled, it's was my first legacy tesla, only second legacy ever. I had it for a couple hours at the most 3, then like every other day the server crashes. When I load back in, no tesla. Also no recourse I can take to get that weapon back. Until today they were "very sorry you item has gone missing. Unfortunately due to tool limitations we are unable to restore lost items." But let some scrap from important premium members dissappear and they'll shut down servers. All of them. And won't stop until the bug is fixed and their items restored. It's hard not to see that as" we wouldn't piss on fire to put you out if you're a paying customer. Unless you're a continuous, high paying, lucratively exploitable customer "
---
This thread just looks like a beg for attention I don't think whatever Bethesda is cares
---
Me two on both consoles
---
You can't?
---
Also I can't vend either. Already encoutered three players that sell more scrap for less caps. And they are farming lead, steel and acid on more places than me, so I am out of business. I refuse to sell plans for more caps that I already set and refuse to try and sell crap legendaries or aid items that hardly anyone buys.
---
I play solo, so there is usually someone that tries to get my workshop.
---
Not shady still.  There is a limitation for some items sure.  It does feel like they do not know what they are doing.
---
Spycrabbing away!
---
I may go for it, sounds like it's more stable and would be great for playing with friends.... now if only I had friends :')
---
I can‚Äôt see us getting it back now.
---
Youtubers like Yang, healvsbabyface. Are click bait youtubers who never played they game past beta but continue to bash the game spreading fake news and generly degrade the game.
---
Sorry was at work and couldn‚Äôt reply. Glad you got it figured out. 
---
Yeah that ones cool as well
---
I use my iPhone 7, and signed up for the beta for iOS 13 so that I could use my controller. I think Android requires the latest build as well, Android 10 (Pie, I think?). It's released for some devices not all but Google stated they wanted to have it live for everyone by December so it should be soon.
---
Maybe there's insider trading "shit boss our stock is too high" , "hold my beer, time to put plan x into effect"
---
Bethesda announces $100 sub
---
Stocks drop.
---
(This is a joke, no idea if there stocks have dropped and not accusing)
---
You don‚Äôt even know what Bethesda is and you‚Äôve come to espouse an opinion on the efficiency of this thread?
---
Get lost, BOZO.
---
Yes and no. The downside to playing with friends is that (from what I've seen) people tend to miss lore in the form of notes, terminals, environmental storytelling, etc. and are then confused by a "lack of explanation" for things. I've only played solo and I have fun.
---
You used to be able to play a game a full game without all the shit that is currently plaguing the games industry. But then a few people thought hey let's see how much more money we can earn from video games. Some people accepted the extra costs, possibly in good faith who's to say, but now we have a shitshow where we need to pay for features literally asked for when the game was announced. So yeah you're really dumb and you should feel bad if you think fallout 1st is a good feature (This should all be free). The worst thing is that this will bleed over into other games, where you're just gonna pay for everything that used to be included in the game at no extra cost.
---
I say that for the people who are on the fence on whether or not they‚Äôre still having fun. When I first started playing, I loved it, then hated it, loved it again, hated it and didn‚Äôt play for months, but now I‚Äôm in the grove of knowing I almost can‚Äôt put it down. A game like this needs constant discussions and opinions in order for everyone to have a voice, but I agree with you in the fact that if you‚Äôre just here to tell people like me that I‚Äôm wrong because you‚Äôre having a bad time, then the best course of action would be to leave or start a discussion lol
---
Where's that?
---
I‚Äôd feel sorry for the guys who this happened to but the fact that you paid Todd Howard a second time after the disaster that 76 has already been is too stupid to ignore.
---
Don't buy it, Bethesda doesn't deserve your money
---
Well, yeah I completely agree there tbh.
---
I only mentioned the glitch fix part being a good thing bc they didnt try to put that behind a paywall for once :/
---
Great. Here comes this dude guns out talking shit again. Your feeding into the arguing isn't helping at all regardless of your clever user name
---
If it was easy I would have left long ago.
---
I didn‚Äôt buy it for the private servers, I bought it for the scrap item. I like to farm, and before this item I could not farm because I had no place to put stuff. I haven‚Äôt played the game for like 10 months because of this. This $13 will give me a couple more weeks of enjoyment before I am bored again. Seems like money well spent to me.
---
&gt;	They owe us nothing.
---
Holy shit, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre the dream consumer for Bethesda lmao. $100 for absolute shit. But hey, if you got your moneys worth, more power to you. Game won‚Äôt survive for long.
---
Absolutely correct, this kind of monetization is only becoming normalized because enough people are buying in that it's worthwhile to the publisher even at the detriment of their reputation.
---
If Bethesda posts incredible growth this quarter and implodes next year the management will consider their job well done because they achieved incredible short-term gains.
---
The rest of us will have no new Fallout or Elder Scrolls games.
---
They‚Äôre working on ways to get it back
---
Agreed, and I was the same as on and off but I'm back and really enjoying it more than ever, especially cause a friend got into it too
---
I went to take the grafton steel workshop and I swear to god the super mutants were just hanging about like I was 5 minutes early and they weren't ready yet.
---
Based off my experience that is not true, I played fallout 76 religiously upon released and loved the game, but the intentional shitty game design the MASSIVE fuckin flaws that persist to this day and the micro transactions that you get ads for ingame made me quit long before they announced this fucking egregious update that honestly makes me fucking sad, so I‚Äôm honestly only reading and being active on this sub again to tell people not to support this, and if you see that as ‚Äúbeing a troll‚Äù that‚Äôs your own fault... PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, do not support these greedy people!
---
There's is at least 4 different versions according to the recent datamine and a pic of at least three together hinting at a possible bundle.
---
Whether we see it in the normal atom shop is a matter of debate or whether it'll be exclusively for its now premium players in fallout 1st
---
Game stable no bugs or crashes.. that would be a hell of a dream game. But in actual fact even a huge mmo such as ESO still has bugs glitches and crashes alot.
---
Isn't this kind of a negative?
---
Not that remote play runs smoother, that is nice. But that you have to pay extra for the game to run smoothly. Shouldn't it be that way from the get go?
---
There is no problem as far as I'm concerned, all of you people just want to shit on the game for everything Bethesda does.
---
Bethesda doesnt care about you. You are the minority
---
Alot of that doesn't hold true to most Bethesda games 1-6 are just issues they have with that engine right?
---
I know, but I have to hold out hope seeing how much I lost.
---
Yes and No... Of course, the main blame has to go towards Bethesda and in the end it is only your decision how you spend your money BUT it's a fact that you are directly supporting Bethesdas disgusting behaviour and people like you, that enable the companies by giving them money for insults like this, are the main reason why the gaming industry at large is going down the drain. So I very much sympathize with the people calling people like you out because that is exactly what you deserve, although the tone might be too toxic.
---
I think they shouldve sticked with the Fo4 weights for items, with all ammo having a weight of 0 for exemple.
---
7 out of 10 as I‚Äôm missing regular npc quest lines, the fact that everyone is dead and you know that when going on the quest to find someone takes away something from it. 9 out of 10 when you do the same thing with 2 or 3 friends. Short disclaimer there is a mistress of mystery quest line that actually works great in the world where everyone is dead.
---
GOOD
---
Was it duped from the old days or did you just do a crazy amount of grinding?
---
Where are these lots of people? Lol and why would the servers be packed if everyone should be enjoying their ‚Äúprivate‚Äù server?
---
Acid: Bloatfly syringer, nuke zone, thunderdome base
---
let's all try fallout 1st for a month, that's how it starts.
---
Hey guys i know it's been a month and i know they've upped the price to 100 bucks a month but lets try it still, you don't have any right to complain if you didn't try it
---
Hey guys i know they want your lung or kidney to even earn access to the game but let's just give a show of good faith and give them either so we can at least see what they made.
---
Hey guys i know you need to sell your soul and 40 years of your life away to see 1 second of gameplay, but let's at least see what's going on.
---
Slippery slope.
---
you are not wrong how ever they have lied to us multiple times about other less significant things and everyone just kind of shrugged it off myself included I saw loads of people saying "if they are willing to make you pay 7$ for a fridge whats stopping them from adding ptw things blah blah blah" and I just thought everyone was over reacting and sure enough look what happened plus its not the pass that upsets people its the fact that the specifically said they would be nothing of the sort multiple times and then we got blind sided with it AFTER THE DELAYED THE WASTELANDERS DLC. The delay wouldn't be a problem if they didn't do this shit I would rather have it be delayed than have it be the absolute dumpster fire that fo76 was when it released. No one is mad about the pass per-say but rather the fact that they have finally crossed the line of adding something that costs more than other much better subscription services on a game where they should be focusing on trying to redeem themselves instead of creating ptw content. look at no mans sky there rep was tarnished when it released but if you go back to play it they have added everything they said they would plus more and they did it all without a single micro transaction. Thats what bgs should have done but no they are greedy lying scumbags just like EA just like activision 
---
(sorry for the rant if you couldnt tell I am a little bit upset)
---
But they were right tho
---
&gt; I work in software with a company that has 50 + products and each product is evaluated and resources granted or removed depending on success and other things. 
---
So you should be well aware that by spending your money on it will influence their decision to do it again in the future.
---
yeah. that‚Äôs bullshit. there are so many counter examples that i won‚Äôt bother listing them - this is learned behaviour by the publishers, fed by your responses. you can either sink your time and dollars into swill from the top 3 publishers, or you can broaden your horizon just slightly, realise you can have real fun in a game without being treated like a piece of shit with a credit card.
---
No. I lost over 10 plastic and over 3k acid, etc. They owe me that back.
---
This is prolly the truest prediction
---
I‚Äôm only bothered about the flux, had about 100. This time I‚Äôm keeping a few bulk of everything in my normal stash and important scrap like flux and ballistic fibre.
---
Mindblowing. That lie isn't dishonest to you at all?
---
I could live without most of the junk it sucks yes but the fact I don‚Äôt have my 65 vault 94 steel gets to me more than anything.
---
Respect your opinion - well worded
---
Personally, I enjoy the game even with its problems (online now). Though I am hoping it will get even better.   
---
I don‚Äôt understand some people speaking poorly about a game that provided hundreds of hours of entertainment.
---
Same. It‚Äôs a extremely dry game at this point. I sometimes sit in my camp and stare at my bobble head collection. That‚Äôs pretty interesting
---
Something to keep in mind: there are folks who worked on this game and did some amazing stuff.  (Stories, items, scenery...)
---
Marketing is making the bad decisions and bugs aren't being addressed.
---
But there are folks that are diehard about this franchise, and they aren't all players.  And I feel bad for them.
---
&gt;Already encoutered three players that sell more scrap for less caps. And they are farming lead, steel and acid on more places than me, so I am out of business.
---
Right, so what does it matter if people in private get an advantage, when you are already disadvantaged by players who can own multiple workshops in public.
---
Other World is not related to Fallout **universe**. People just love Avellone's imagination, though it is not related to post-apocalyptic theme.
---
I‚Äôd love the the combined stash space say 5k across all the characters... although it might negate ppl buying the scrap box...
---
It's a double edged sword, true.
---
Running smooth for Remote Play is more of a grey area. There are SO. MANY. THINGS. that can screw it up that the expectation of a great experience should be low from the get-go through Remote Play. Developers don't devote resources very often to make sure Remote Play works well, it's usually just coincidence if it does, honestly.
---
I feel you man, I am in the EXACT same boat. But not only did I preorder, I actually got my good friend to do so as well. It was all under the assumption that playing fallout together would be magnificent, and that Bethesda was a company that could be trusted. Now I feel as if I owe my friend a new game.... :/ DAMMIT this sucks. Just might be the last Bethesda game I ever play.
---
I think it's a default thing, I've noticed theres always a little 10mm ammo in them whenever I take the workshop.
---
Yeah... me too.
---
I can spare 10 plastic if you‚Äôre desperate
---
 i just started playing FO76 a little over a month ago. i am like level 42.  it has been fun and much better than it was made out to be.  i wont be subscribing but i will still play it.  i tried some Outer worlds today. played for a couple hours.  i did not find myself falling in love wit it. its lacking something.  but it is like Fallout only in space really.  if i like a game, i usually cant wait to get back on and play some more. Did not feel that way with Outerworlds. its not a bad game or anything. Just wasnt feeling it.
---
Fallout 76 is a never ending wasteland but not in a good way
---
It is clear you lack nuance. That was not unexpected.
---
You actually repair these engines yourself ?
---
Sure. I havent played any other MMOs in a very long time so I don't have much to compare. Is stability an unrealistic expectation?
---
What you do with your money is your business and no one else. I blame Bethesda for fallout 76 bring the dumpster fire its turned in too. Sorry to hear you are being harassed in fallout 76. But sadly buying this kind of scam only tells Bethesda one thing. That it is OK to do it again.
---
Yes, and when online games didnt have micropayments they had.... a subscription model!
---
And as far as I'm concerned it wasn't false advertised, except for when they said the micropayments would be cosmetic only, which was stupid of them, I admit.  They probably thought they could do it, but it didnt make them enough money. And if they cant turn a profit, the game shuts down.  And truly, why wouldn't they eventually go down the exact same path as ESO?
---
You should just be happy they didn't decide to make it pay to play, period.  Instead they're letting most pay for free, piggy-backing off of those who are willing to pay to play.  And why shouldnt we actually get value for the money we put into it?
---
If you want the game to be better, it has to be profitable.  Otherwise it just goes away
---
Salty Reddit can suck it, I love solo play, I‚Äôll probably pop in on adventure mode to sell some stuff at rock bottom prices every now and then.
---
He has to care somewhat, or he'd not have made the comment.

and then bethesda flips you off

It isn't, it's a fake quote like most Einstein "quotes" are. https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein

---
What did you need so much junk for exactly. I keep everything under 50. Some items I don't even keep like glass and ceramic.
---
Lmao are you people for real? We paid $60 for this trash, now you say we should pay an extra $13 for the same trash? We‚Äôve tried the game, we know what it is and we know it‚Äôs not worth a cent more. An outfit and empty server aren‚Äôt gonna change the core game haha
---
You don't even have to be a whale to get an advantage in this trash fire game,  the dev room is still fully accessible.
---
It's ok to not like it and it's ok to like it. What's not ok is the amount of personal attacks on each other as a community
---
Imagine paying up-front for a year of DirecTV but then your box doesn't work and you get no channels. You'd be pissed off, right? Or would you say "this is capitalism, suck it up?"
---
My point is that when companies treat people poorly, they have to come together and work to stop it from happening again. There is plenty of regulation in capitalistic societies.
---
Yes I'm abstaining myself.   But, just to be clear, I am not doing so out of protest per se.  I  am truly nauseated by what Bethesda has done and I just can't look at the game the same way.   I just can't.   When I try to step into the world, I'm thinking. "I'm in a game world designed by people who have lost their minds."
---
Incredibly useful and yet doesn't actively fuck over others if you have it and they don't. Right then.
---
God it‚Äôs like enlightened centrism over there, people are happy to throw more money at a company that has failed to deliver time and time again.
---
And don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs their money to waste if that‚Äôs what they want to do, but why not waste it on something objectively better? Like are they just doing out of irony as a meme? 
---
It‚Äôs fascinating and frustrating.
---
This shows what their priorities are, they care about money first that is why they spent time working on the private servers instead of wastelanders
---
I dont see how a person with 1st class status has an advantage over me...I guess they can store more scrap? I've never needed more than the 800 limit I have, has never hindered me once.
---
Do they get a dmg buff or something?
---
Try add thousands of scrap at once. When I tested it with just few pieces again, it didn't dissapear. Maybe it could be because many players were adding all of their junk to scrapboxes at same time and databases just couldn't handle the load + poor coding.
---
Big brain you got
---
I did this yesterday and was still able to start a private server several hours later even tho i canceled my sub and got a refund which "ended" it immediately.
---
Well stated and fair
---
1) No
---
2) If you cleared it, yes.  The loot is instanced to you, so if you go to your private server it will be gone there as well.
---
3) Yes
---
[edit, accidentally said no to three but meant yes]
---
Ya its unrealistic. Eso is even searching for a better engine to run the game. After soo manny performance issues. And bethesda will in time need to do the same.
---
Ah, I got the game for free with my xbox one x but even so I wouldn't subscribe to a single game. Season pass etc is one thing but I just can't stand subscriptions. To me it's like a drug or gambling addict.  
---
I did enjoy the game though but I'm just a casual gamer so I never used any atoms, all I do is roam around the world by myself so I guess these problems don't apply to me too much
---
I agree people shouldn't be destructive. But they can be angry -- Bethesda said they would do a bunch of stuff for free and did very little before switching to this pay model.
---
I‚Äôm glad to see a lot of other players feel the same way and are doing the same thing.
---
Your tent follows the same rules as your camp. It will try to place where you had it if able.
---
Depends on if the server you get has been used or not.
---
Come find me in my private world, OH wait, you can‚Äôt! Mu hu ha ha ha ha ha ha haüòà
---
They didn't even fix Grafton mayor spam like they claimed in their patches they are so incompetent that you cant even trust their offcial patch notes.
---
Well by paying for the sub you're telling Bethesda its ok to screw over the customers. The community has become toxic because the game has become toxic. When you contribute to that you are part of the problem. I agree with everybody you encountered calling you out for this.
---
Nah, I'll be in Sanctuary Hills
---
It's literally just junk. You have your own world to farm now.
---
Anything that makes them money it seems they'll fix within 2 days, hilarious. There are bugs that have been on this game since beta and they've done nothing about it.
---

---
I've taken to using the prosnap camera for buildings and pano shots and photo mode if I want to be in them. If someone has taken a photo of you, it was probably me, lol.
---
considering they havent backed down yet you might as well uninstall my dude. I don't have any hopes for a dedicated server made through mods as it'd be c&amp;d'd faster than nintendo c&amp;d's fan games. 
---
Mods are going to be a nightmare too, probably only going to be allowed to use paid mods and what not.. I hope like hell I'm wrong

The devil has come for their due payment.
---
They're very different, but I enjoy Fallout 4 more.
---
I'm probably going to update and take one last romp through the place for old time sake.
---
Then uninstall.
---
How much did you lose?
---
Once they add mods, bigger camp budgets, bigger building areas, and persistent workshops (all of which they've said are in the works), then it'll be worth it IMO.
---
I would probably pay for that... Maybe
---
You‚Äôre the same clueless consumer that whines about nothing to do and no content after no lifing a game that you bought on sale for 24.99.
---
Sorry you want something free and that mediocre experience then their are loads of titles out there.
---
Thanks! Didn't know
---
You type like an idiot.
---
Ah Whitesprings, got it!
---
Have fun "uninstalling" the game.  I'm sure you'll be "uninstalling" it again for the next round of circlejerking.
---
You can still access the stash, take stuff out, but not put any new stuff in it
---
It doesnt matter if your server has "been used"
---
"Players have also expressed concern that their private servers¬†have appeared already looted, but Bethesda clarified that this is most likely not an issue. Instead, private worlds behave like Fallout 76's public worlds do. "When a Fallout 1st member starts a Private World, a dedicated World is launched on an AWS server," Bethesda said. "Players who have seen looted containers upon login may be experiencing the expected behavior upon log out and log in. Loot is instanced for each player in containers. As Fallout 76 players know, if you loot a container on one server, and then log out and log back into another server, the container remains in a looted state for a period of time.":

---
Ouch, can't imagine why a fixed item like the survival tent would require the same zone size as a regular CAMP. Its not like this thing is going to take a lot of cycles to render. :(
---
Lol so you seriously think your example doesnt introduce some new extenuating circumstances? Like animal rights and real-world violence?
---
I‚Äôm lost.. Thats the opposite of what you original post said...
---
10000% agree with you. While I like the idea. I think it should have limitations. Like say a cool down of 1 hour and can only be placed once a day. Kinda like a emergency camp setup. That way we don‚Äôt have like 60ish (not sure what make player count is) camps blocking all the good areas.
---
Well obviously 90% of people would strongly be against this! BUT what about an updated hunter hunted mode that‚Äôs call the purge. Or possibly make a whole town or large area on the map the purge zone!!! Like if you enter into the ash heap it‚Äôs official purge night. Or what about a purge event of some sort? Last man standing wins! You could do something along these lines because it‚Äôs just not reasonable to say, do this or don‚Äôt even log in, you know? But something definitely could be done for 24 hours!
---
 Its like COD with lit up enemies, weird ass crosshairs and fucking arrows over the badies heads, and the guns are just meh.
---
This might be the cringiest post title I‚Äôve ever seen on this site.
---
Disagree
---
Game pass is way cheap, works fine.
---
My problem is they should fix actual bugs in the base game this fast too, not just something that makes them money.
---
I‚Äôve had a lot of fun with it. Don‚Äôt worry about salty Reddit karma whores, negativity generates likes and that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing.
---
It's one of those annoying areas in which how people chose to spend their money directly impacts those of us who don't want to waste ours on mtx when the base game has fundamental stability and QoL issues. I'm a huge fan of the franchise and would totally be down with a Fallout MMO a la ESO, but the incredibly shoddy and cheap way Bethesda has rolled out FO76 and is now apparently converting it into some weird version of an MMO (I have zero doubt that any content related DLC beyond Wastelanders will be treated the same way ESO does its paid updates) is beyond frustrating and makes me fear for the future of the IP.
---
He is supporting practices with his money that are against his own interests as a consumer. Not a "bad guy" but at the very least an enabler for things that affect him himself. He is sending the message of "Yeah, this is fine. This is something I like getting done to me and the games I enjoy".
---
We are also talking about a game that had expensive *preorder editions*, launched *full price*, with *cosmetic microtransactions*, then adding *tangible gameplay advantages as microtransactions* and now a *subscription WITH gameplay advantages*. All while not functioning properly. That is beyond excessive.
---
I suppose the subscription is its own punishment with the rewards being buggy and dysfunctional.
---
Food fight?
---
The issue here is a lack of transparency. I've defended this game time and time again since the BETA and they've decided that we don't fucking matter.
---
at this point? anyone who buys failout 1st should be treated as the enemy and called out on there shit as they are just as bad as the greedy devs
---
I don't know where you are playing ESO but I'm located in central Ohio and I never experience lag have very few/ extremely rare glitches and have never had it crash in about 2000hrs of play time so you might want to get back on ESO and check it out as this is far from a truthful statement. I have not had a play session longer then 3 hrs in Fo76 that hasn't crashed at least once, hell if I use a repair kit from the queen I crash 75-80% of the time.
---
&gt; Shaming a group of people is not harassment
---
Ha, that's the official Reddit/Twitter definition of harassment. Not saying that I agree... But I am also getting burnt out on everyone rushing to get their hate karma. So I'll be glad when you people move on to the next trend.
---
Remember when that one duping exploit was around for months? That's totally not a serious issue...
---
The Crew (racing game from Ubisoft) gave us a lot of time. It would also periodically remind you and have a constant countdown timer. I think it was like 15 or 30 minutes.  Even then. They would always announce maintenance days in advance and have said maintenance during times of day where the least amount of people were on.
---
It is getting old. I'm a new player and I wanna see some tips and tricks... Instead its people whining (rightfully so) towards an optional subscription service.
---
For me, it's a coin toss.  I dont subscribe to all the hate 76 gets, but I understand it.  I also only have 98 hours of FO:4 game time.  Life mostly got in the way of me playing FO:4 but I've recently started playing it again and it was really only because I'm far enough in 76 that I'm kind of in a lull for things to do other than farming stuff.
---
Some people will use technical reasons to explain the difference but with simple game play for me, I would almost go to FO:4.  But like I said, with so little game play I'm judging that decision on that I've recently become more interested in playing it again.
---
Was anthem worse than this?
---
Let‚Äôs see the tattoo
---
I don't think the performance or stability is quite good enough for me to justify a subscription at this point is all. If things ran a bit better I wouldn't be against the idea. 
---
Thanks for your reply
---
Please do it so these posts leave here. We get it . You're mad and you quit.
---
 Best news I've had today, thank you. ;)
---
But what if it DOES take you to a new server? If you built a workshop, turrets and buildings etc., would they still be there even if you have to re claim them? Or does all that stuff disappear?  If your back on the same server of coarse. Or do you invite a friend so you can just dashboard and replay with team like a normal server?
---
COMMUNISM IS NOT ALLOWED. SUBJECT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO AMERICAN VAULT-TEC REPRESENTATIVES.
---
You must not play many online only games. Be salty all you like they are not asking for much to keep providing me with a game I thoroughly enjoy playing.
---
For some reason you need to have stairs or a ladder first in place. Roofs are fine though.
---
just didn't understand how some games can offer this exact service for free but a community that has stuck by this game has to pay top dollar!! How about do what was promised before launch the reason a lot of people bought this game and actually provide the content the community has been asking for!!
---
yikes
---
I'd not say I'm defending them, I'm against the subscription because I think the game's current state is pretty bad. But If the game was in a better state I'd not mind the subscription stuff, devs need to eat and the game's atom shop probably don't feed a bunch of devs.
---
yep my mistake
---
Private servers advertised like you invite friends, while actually everybody in your friends list can join your server. Added a bunch of people because you wanted to have lot's of friends in the game. well guess they can get into your PRIVATE world now.
---
ALSO, private worlds should be MODDABLE and FREE. I don't care what your argument is about costs on servers. That's what the Atom store is for, that's what the buyin for this game is for. Either free to play or microtransactions and a monthly payment. The warcraft model didn't work for ESO so why should you accept it here?
---
If "loyal fans" don't buy stuff in Fallout 76...who will?  It's not as if FO76 has done all that well outside of the established fan base.
---
Zenimax's [board of directors](https://www.zenimax.com/about) for anyone that wanted a source. Which also apparently includes **baseball legend Cal Ripken Jr.** for some reason.
---
You are completely wrong. That's 160$ for 1 year of the full game
---
Aye. I hate when it locks up during inspect for a repair kit. I get crashes opening up my perk pages quite often, too
---
Nah ps4
---
I aimed the idea of cannon fodder at the problem and spent 4800 scrip over the discount weekend. I got tons of junk, but at least a dozen valuable weapons. It‚Äôs going to happen just by virtue of serendipity. You and I have equal chances to get the same stuff.
---
I‚Äôm also utilizing the community‚Äôs diversity to add value to my random luck. I don‚Äôt have a use for a bloody/faster fire 50 cal, but I know it‚Äôs valuable and can be traded for a variety of high end stuff. Think of it like being a commercial farmer. Yes, you can survive by growing what you need, but growing extra and trading the blacksmith a few bushels of potatoes for a new steel plow blade is going to more lucrative as a long term strategy. The smith eats well, you can plant your fields easily, everyone wins. The more land you can plow, the more crops you can harvest, the more food you can sell, the better your life becomes.
---
You got downvoted because this sub is full of rotten children. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it.
---
what would you suggest, these games are in rare supply nowadays, no other company makes them, so yeah I want more games like this.
---
....and you don't even need acid to get it! Can Chimes!
---
No dear friend, it‚Äôs an investment. Fair trade I do say. 
---
Internet points in exchange for goods you don‚Äôt want anymore. üòâ
---
Voting with wallets is broken when you introduce the human factor unfortunately.
---
I've said it before. I'll say it again every time I see this totally original joke. Grind for it, just like we grind for atoms.
---
I have 600+ hours in the game. How many do you have? 50?
---
Since the game drops below what can reasonably be expected as standard, the debate changes.
---
It's not "an okay game that some like, other's dont, so we are all right, matter of taste, to each his own".
---
Fallout 76 has been royally falsely advertised; straight up 100% lying to the customer, and left in a broken state that drops below what is playable or acceptable. It doesn't qualify for the bare minimum of being "a game".
---
So with that in mind, the debate is, should you reward someone for shitting on the customer and doing a piss poor job -- especially knowing you will cultivate more of the same behavior, if you support it.
---
Developers don't care about the players, in fact they hate you, they can't stand the sight of you, and it's reflected by every developer you ever saw throughout history and his treatment of the customer. In most cases you will get banned off any official forum if you bring up any complaints at all. And it's been that way always.
---
There wouldn't be any shitty developers or garbage games if neckbeards didn't let them get away with it and paid them to to be douchebags. Your money grows the entire culture of gaming development across platforms, genres an across ages.
---
Give you the same advice I give to developers, man the fuck up, take some responsibility and have some self-respect.
---
Imagine the guy doing the press releases, sitting there having to write the biggest load of lies and manipulations knowing how full of shit he is. When was that last time he took a look in the mirror, has this become normal for him? Crazy.
---
Then ok, dont take responsibility for others, still I always tell people, even if you want to be entirely selfish and only care about your own needs -- when you facilitate shitty games by giving them money, you ruin all games, for everyone... including yourself.
---
Developers look down on you, so that way it's easier to treat you terribly, you being a lesser human and so they won't grow a conscience or professional integrity out of the blue one day. They have to be forced, at gunpoint, to continuously raise the bar and held accountable because the industry they work in is unregulated; stuff they do would be illegal. 
---
Luckliy over the last few years with social media exploding they can no longer lock a story down and a lot of neckbeards are speaking out against the malpractice, so at the very least they can't cover any of it up anymore, ableit still milking the whales as of yet
---
I hope you die with prostate cancer i bought it
---
Enjoy the game bud. Your money will hopefully go to development time for the game and wastelanders. A lot of people can pay for 1 month of subscription by going to work for an hour, I don't see it as a big issue.
---
Now these are the posts I like to see! lol. Much better than the posts fishing for easy Karma by all saying the same thing lol.
---
I hope EAs Star wars game does really well next month, because that will set a precedent that no game company can ignore.
---
which ps4 do you have
---
If FO76 is less profitable than Skyrim or FO4, why would it make sense for ZeniMax to decide to concentrate on multiplayer?  I don't get it.
---
Omg waste of money
---
Glad you can get into the game. I still can't get the damn thing to connect now that maintenance is finished. But I'm supposed to want to buy their subscription. Riiiiight.
---
Oh shit that's right. I totally forgot about that. Dude you made my day.
---
Thanks for your 0 input!
---
I don't see any menu in the launcher or in-game with the word reset.  I do see a "Scan and Repair" so I'll try that next.
---
After that I'll reboot the PC just for good measure.
---
PS. Added with edit: Nope.  That didn't fix it.  I've gone of Appliances and Misc a few times and no-show.  I did get to use the pumpkins and more from the Halloween kit but no fog machine yet.
---
Software engineer here and this is utter bullshit.  In the back end there is a database tracking the location of every item in the game.  The way its coded means that instances of the same item type have minimal impact, but the number of different items in different locations does.  That means every tick in the game, the server is running queries against this item database.  The more variety of items you have in a particular location ie your stash box, the larger the server performance impact trying to track all of those items.  If the general stash limit was lifted and you filled your stash box with a large variety of different items you'd grind the server to a halt.  
---
But for scrap in the new box, the variety of items is limited, you just have a large number of the same item in the same location so you don't hose the server here.
---
TL:DR version: Most tantrums and rage quits here come from projecting evil onto the blank slate of ignorance or simply imitation of a bunch of Youtuber fraudsters and demagogues that are at the very least recycling other peoples old footage of bugs at launch and presenting it as the current state of the game.
---
It‚Äôs not a joke. And I‚Äôm happy in game. I grind ~6 hours a day. 
---
But before someone dumps completely I was saying I‚Äôd be happy to vulture them. Who knows, even if one soul decides to will their fortune I‚Äôll be overjoyed.
---
Exactly, but if you tell the die hard fan boys that all Zenimax cares about anymore is money and not their player base, they get all offended.
---
PS4 slim with an aftermarket 1TB SSD internal drive which is where FO76 is installed
---
This is why Bethesda should outsource all future Fallout development to Obsidian.
---
You know, the guys who got the ball rolling with the series in the first place.
---
Zenimax/Bethesda are not publicly traded.
---
I'm not angry at you if you paid for the subscription, all I want to understand is *why*? What made you feel like they had earned your additional money?
---
Uhh...what? How do you figure? You know you would need to be online to connect to the server right?
---
It‚Äôs dope dude
---
It's pretty good I think. Glad to be able to do events like I want. Legendary farming is almost guaranteed. Gonna be setting up Flea Market Fridays soon on PS4. Also so many more mobs spawn at events so XP farming is great. Dance emotes are funny
---
i never knew that. but i do sometimes get a glitch where a normal plasma core gives me 500 instead of 250
---
I love it
---
They're blinded, so was I at some point but they let their greed show with this 1st stuff.
---
The game is fucked. Bethesda wont fix it. You'd all best move on to better.
---
Haha no problem. I racked my brain forever when I first started to build since it worked fine in FO4.
---
I can't and won't get into the game, kinda' uninstalled it. üò¨
---
They were also F2P games. And Fallout 1st is P2W.
---
They didn't just say cosmetics only, they said they wouldn't be locking content behind paywalls or having any season/game passes and such. And it wasn't just some Pete Himes quotes, it was Todd Howard and the news posts for this game over the past few months reaffirming they wouldn't do these things. It was lying about the stash limit existing for technical/performance reasons and then turning around showing that they lied about that too.
---
I'd rather the game shuts down instead of slowly killing itself. You should know damn well this money isn't going towards improving the game, just like the atom store gradually getting more malicious didn't.
---
I play a couple and the craziest thing about them is they were free, listen to the community and stick to cosmetic only micro transactions. They‚Äôre asking for a lot when they want $60 up front, then $100 for more convenient gameplay on top of the ludicrously priced atom shop items that include gameplay advantages. Oh and don‚Äôt forget that the game is broken and when it decides to work, it‚Äôs boring.
---
Severity AND Complexity. 
---
And I don‚Äôt know what specific duping you‚Äôre talking about. They‚Äôve addressed duping numerous times.
---
Ah, that will definately factor in. Although Microsoft is currently testing a console/mobile streaming service, it's not available at the moment.
---
I too am enjoying it a great deal, really like that I can play by myself and actually do events and the like
---
They do... this isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve done a hot fix.
---
Yeah. As soon as I started building my third floor the game disconnected me from the server :p
---
Ill bring the glowing meat steaks.
---
Im glad you agree
---
As an admitted whale as far as the Atom Shop goes (seriously i weep when i think about how much money i was dumb enough to spend in there) This game is pretty much a waste of my time at this point. Even I wont consider feeding into their pay to win strategy. This Fallout 1st membership is sad and insulting to what's left of the player base. (if after this there is one)  
---
You fools wont see one more dollar from me. Been around since launch and I have over and over again given this game chances it didn't really deserve. I can only tolerate so many times them spitting in our faces and laughing about it. I'm done. Just uninstalled the game.  
---
See ya round you greedy lying fuckers.
---
Well Fallout 76 is 16x the detail of Fallout 4 üòè
---
Uhm, no it does not? It's an example used that applies a common topic to the one at hand. Makes it easier to understand.
---
If you say: it's my money, I can do whatever I want to with it I respond with something that is universally considered to be a bad and inhumane way of spending money. This makes it easier to understand that it is not always quite as simple as just spending your own money, that your responsibility goes beyond that. It does however not imply that supporting an anti-consumer company is just as bad/worse/less bad than buying animal pelts. The assessment of that is not part of the statement at all and irrelevant.
---
Hey, me too!
---
I'm enjoying it so far.  Would have enjoyed it more had the servers not gone down right before I took my lunch break and planned to play... but c'est la vie.
---
I know some people think it's a waste of money, but I'm sure most of them spend even more money on things others would consider a waste of money: Coffee, beer, soda, cigarettes?  We all have our vices. Some worse than others. 
---
I don't consider $8 to be that big of a "waste"
---
The last line is a joke. Some of us are sick to death of trolls and loved the solo aspect of fallout and are glad to have a way to get back to it. This massive level of hate and demonizing everybody who likes it as a series of things ranging from boot lickers to corporate enablers just... Insane. Is this really this big of a deal?
---
The game is losing money because it is a bad game. We don't need to do anything to make it better. That is the whole point. I understand what you are saying and that you are probably a good person, if you are thinking it. But there is a thin line between being good and naive. In this case, I believe it is time to cut the loses and admit defeat. And this is basically what happened. Fallout 1st looks like a desperate cry for help but after all the lies, I don't think they deserve it.
---
I was just thinking if I came to do some Fallout Tourism, Helvetia would definitely be one of the places I‚Äôd like to visit. Thanks for posting!
---
Then let us craft it with glowing meat.
---
What not for 10$? Other games price for skins etc.? Because I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs as much as you want to spend. Whether it‚Äôs loot boxes for weapon skins/ outfits. I mean look at fortnite, you HAVE to buy at least 10 dollars worth of V bucks and I think 10 bucks get you one skin. If not it might be 15 for some. I‚Äôm not sure my son just plays A LOT and has tons of skins that cost an ungodly amount of money. Also gears has premium cosmetics that you can only get from purchase, they offer chances to obtain that currency but it‚Äôs next to impossible. At least fo76 gives you an opportunity to get a lot of atoms for free! Like 50 a day and maybe 50-100 for the weekly challenges. Not to mention all the other countless rewards of -20 -40 -80 for completing simple crafting, repairing and collection challenges which are all things your doing anyway.
---
No, their items are gonna die with the game. Maybe if you pay them 12.99 a month they'll rent you their gear though üò¨
---
You people suck, honestly. Have some self respect, stop making these dumb fucking naive posts. They are a corporation, not you're fucking friend. If you don't like it, stop supporting it financially. That's all you can and should do. Goddamn fucking dweebs.
---
I like the game, though.
---
It's not on the largest and most used store front, they aren't getting a dime from me for supporting Epic store.
---
Spoken like a Boomer, life isn't fair so you work to make it fair you don't just go well that is life and ignore it like a child.  
---
Also nice try with the troll deflection at the end, all your points literally mean nothing to the conversation. Once again life isn't fair that is true, but that is why you work for change to make it fair not sit on your ass hoping you get lucky.
---
not saying anything and keep paying for shit. that's how we got here in the first place. People should stand up and stand against these practices. Because fallout should be good.
---
I agree with all that you've said. The servers going down kinda blows, but what little I got to play I enjoyed. I paid $12.99 for a 1 month subscription and I dont see any downside so far
---
Maybe. Who knows. Figured I‚Äôd cast a wide net though.
---
And AJ keeps going on about the blue power armour which bugs me.
---
you are a casual gamer, those that have played hundreds of hours will be pissed, the more you play a game the more you see its flaws, if present. And what i think really gets people going is those that thought this game was going to be a fan service instead of a cash grab. The all content is to be free cosmetics will cost if you think that fo1st dosent break that promise youre blind or dont care.
---
Uhhh, Focusing on one problem incorrectly that's misinformation.
---
If you want to complain use an actual argument. Use facts, use detail. use anything but just crying.
---
At first I was against it, but for ¬£11.99 you get over ¬£8 worth of Atoms, a unique outfit that would probably cost about 900 Atoms anyway, icons, emotes, unlimited junk and a buttery smooth private server (which is handy for Raids and farming nuked WS without idiots 1-shotting all my legendaries), the tent seems handy, I don't really have a use for it.
---
Salty reddit wants you to play solo for free as you should be able too.
---
The first time they didn't fix it for months. More ways kept popping up and they took their time fixing it, private worlds introduced a new method. Even the immortality glitch has been around for 6 MONTHS. If it doesn't make them money it's not a priority to fix.
---
The game has redeeming qualities. Denying that is just denying yourself an opportunity to enjoy a game which, for all its flaws and shaky release, can be pretty damn fun to play. 
---
And I agree. I really hope the die-hard fans don't feed into this. If this model is proven successful, it will be the end of Fallout as we know it.
---
If you loved Fallout 3 buy Outer Worlds instead its made by Fallout New Vegas and the original Fallout game Devs, Bethesda doesn't deserve your money  they turned into a garbage company.
---
Im glad you're enjoying it as much as I am. The private servers and the armor made it for me, love playing by myself
---
4 because of Cait. 76 because of Preston Garvey.
---
I actually found it (AngryJoe's Latest) to be very relatable to my own personal experience...
---
&gt; that they delayed waste landers dlc
---
i never say this but im glad it was delayed
---
wastelanders will make or break the game and im pretty sure htey want it to be good
---
Even for the month it‚Äôs worth storing like 400 pounds of junk lol
---
Okay I would totally love for them to hotfix the game breaking immortality bug that has been in the game for 6 months rather than a scrapbox lmao.
---
Nah. One I can think of off the top of my head is Dragons Dogma Online.
---
That's a dumb way to live lmao.
---
Consumers have a voice. We should vote with our wallets, yes. But abandoning a series we enjoy because the current creators are making shitty choices? Doesn't sound like a good way to go about promoting solid game choices in our beloved franchise.
---
&gt; misinformation
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation
---
There is no false or inaccurate information in the arguments we've seen. Nor are there hoaxes, tricks, or parody. 
---
Saying "XYZ shouldn't be a paid feature" is not misinformation.
---
Oh shit I didn't even think of Firefly.  Is it really like that?
---
They have been profitable, but they are also old games by now, Skyrim could very well be 14 years old by the time TES VI releases. It is hard to tell if new single player titles by the company would be successful again after so long time, with much worse reputation, and more competition. So, they might be looking at how the more recent single player releases are doing, I think Starfield in particular will be important.
---
Someone else posted a nice example about the village in Chile but I got a nice one that is here in the US that highlights what capitalism does: Flint, MI.
---
They still dont have clean water, but the governor of Michigan is selling the rights to spring water that could be used for Flint to Nestle.
---
Capitalism isn't causing the mass extinction we are facing globally. Capitalism doesn't keep countries from developing as their resources are taken at gunpoint to fuel our consumerism. Capitalism doesn't justify taking the livelihood of a father barely making it because someone decides they want to make an extra buck. Capitalism isn't causing global warming. 
---
Nope, no way
---
Finally someone else sees this. Everyone is gargling everything he ejaculates out of his mouth because screaming gets imbeciles attention like flies to dung.
---
Yea like all the YouTube rants bitching about the bugs and how shit it is yet the clips are from there first responders mission in flatwoods, basically they haven‚Äôt played since the launch and are bringing up bugs and glitches that were fixed a month after the release damn near! It would be different if your clips were of a level 80-280 experiencing these bugs and stuff because you would know they are at least a real player. Those guys are just haters, point blank.
---
I've sold a few and you might sell more during Halloween but not worth the stash weight for a lot of them.
---
&gt; They were also F2P games. And Fallout 1st is P2W.
---
Name a free to play game that didnt also include pay to win features or a crap ton of advertisements?
---
And Fallout 1st isn't P2W.  At best it's pay for minor convenience.  It doesnt even carry over to Nuclear Winter which is the only mode that even has "winners"
---
&gt; They didn't just say cosmetics only, they said they wouldn't be locking content behind paywalls or having any season/game passes and such.
---
What actual CONTENT is locked behind a paywall?  You still have all of the same quests and game modes.
---
And yes, it was fucking stupid of them to say they wouldn't have any season passes, but at the time they were clearly referencing story-based DLC
---
&gt; I'd rather the game shuts down instead of slowly killing itself. You should know damn well this money isn't going towards improving the game, just like the atom store gradually getting more malicious didn't.
---
Why would you rather see it shut down?  Just stop playing.  Why begrudge others the chance to continue enjoying it?  are you that petty?
---
And so long as the game turns a profit, yeah, they're going to continue improving the game.  But they have to pay the salaries of everyone who works on it.
---
I've been playing actively since the beta, and it's gone from a thrilling rush of exploration and battle to a calm wandering and fun little events.  
---
All and all, it fits a niche that few other games tend to for me, and hopefully it will for you too.
---
What I am trying to get at is can I place a tent anywhere on my private server and when I go back to adventure mode will my original building be were it has always been
---
You cant be serious lmao. You happy because y pool u paying 13 dollars a month to play on a private server by yourself? You make me laugh
---
Oh you sweet summer child. Go funnel this energy into something productive, like Hong Kong.
---
You don't support bethesda, you just payed them and showed them that you are willing to pay them for something that should be free.
---
Free? Okay bomber, bomber okay, well I come from Final Fantasy Online, ESO and DC Universe. I paid for all of their services and from someone experienced in paying for these services I can honestly say it is cheaper than I expected it and I plan to keep it beyond just the 1st year. Have fun playing whatever you enjoy, I will too. Supporting this game so I can continue playing is my plan.
---
How does it handle events like Vault 94? It‚Äôs designed to be run as a group but now you‚Äôre solo?
---
&gt; and yelling all kinds of profanity on world coms.
---
and this kids is why i never use voice or text chat and will continue doing that
---
for every good person that uses it as they should there are 100 more that abuse it
---
I told you once and I'll tell you again. Thanks for your 0 input. Have a good day!
---
Paying for them to host a private server is not greedy like every only seems to focus on. All I see is "OMG I HAVE TO PAY FOR A PRIVATE SERVER!" Yes, yes you do, unless you host the server yourself. Which they didn't give us the tools to do. There is an actual complaint to bethesda,
---
Servers cost space. Like I said use an actual argument about issues with the game. I'm not saying I agree with everything Bethesda is doing. But I also hate the uninformed spouting off false shit as well.
---
I wish I had testicles as big as the people directly behind, and supporting these decisions.
---
Salty Reddit wants the world for free, right now, perfect as they imagine it in their minds.
---
I just wanna collect loot and get a decent gun without having to server hop a million times, have everything looted, and a troll run a pack of super mutants through my camp for the lulz.
---
Please link me a single YouTuber or article that says Bethesda is charging 100$ for a server.
---
Some sites might do clickbait, but they usually describe in detail what's going on.
---
Not sure, have not played too too much and what little I have played I did so as a new character
---
Cash cow then?
---
Hiya. Thanks for your reply. 
---
Whether true of all or most Bethesda games is unknown to me. As for this game, these are the things I would like to see resolved/improved before considering something like a subscription service.
---
No no no, Fallout 76 is not free to play, It doesn't fucking matter if past F2P games were P2W or not. This is a AAA game that charged $60 that is now introducing a subscription model that IS P2W. You get an unlimited stash size now while everyone else is heavily limited, you get to freely enter a private world now gathering all the materials you want, all the workshops you want and all the legandary farming you want and then switching back over the the public servers with your infinite fortune. THIS IS NOT A MINOR CONVENIENCE. This isn't getting a couple junk items an hour or adding a mild amount of time to food durability, it fucking breaks the gameplay and gives these players a clear step up above anyone not paying for the model.
---
They have no credibility anymore, they don't get the benefit of the doubt anymore, they have blatantly lied and there is no reason to think this won't get worse or continue the direction they have been pushing it. They don't get to be a AAA $60 release with a brutal MMO monetization model.
---
And I was the dumbass that made this post https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/d2ikst/cosmetic_only_was_never_stated/
---
https://xkcd.com/1357/
---
I got it too, haven't played much but I'll give it another go with the homies tonight. I'm sure I'll like it. Had the game since beta but I didn't get to play that much either. Love the game, still super fun
---
so far i havent seen a single legendary and i literally just logged in to level 5 super mutants at west tek and im the only one on the server. after all the negativity i thought id try a month to see whats up but i havent seen any improvements. still have mobs t-posing and sliding on the ground. as well as just logging in to completely dead areas that where bodies are already looted. the only plus is i havent lost my junk.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve noticed it too. Not to mention the sub has more subscribers than before
---
Probably all the people who deleted everything yesterday and reinstalled today.
---
What is the immortality bug? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever experienced that‚Ä¶
---
Your camp and tent will be where you placed them unless something else occupies the spot they were in when you join the server.
---
Been up to date on blizzard news?
---
Being mean and toxic in game isn't right however they are not wrong. It is the players that buy into the Atomic store that have lead to Bathesda treating us like this.
---
I'm sad to say I am one of those that has bought from the Atomic Shop but I'm not going to buy into a subscription for this game because there is nothing that will be worth it in FO76 future.
---
Bathesda are nailing FO76's coffin shut.
---
I only fear Wastelanders being pushed into the Subscription model in order to justify it.
---
Somethings are just easy to fix. Somethings are more complex. Are you saying this should not of been fixed?
---
No real complaints. I like the emotes more than the NCR outfit, but that's 'cause I'm never out of my PA, and being "spooky" in Prime armor is just hilarious to me.  
---
The atoms may pay off in the long run, if something particularly intriguing comes out for Halloween or Christmas, or just down the line in general.  
---
All things considered, it doesn't have an many features for me as for others, but I'm still alright with it.
---
My bad, thanks for the correction.
---
It does have redeeming qualities, but the things that were and are wrong with the game far outweigh it's redeeming qualities. To deny THAT is to give Bethesda an excuse not to ever really fix anything. Because if players are already positive, why make improvements?
---
And as far as I'm concerned, Fallout ended with Fallout 3. Fallout 3 was an OK game, but it was not a good Fallout game. It was a shooter with light RPG elements, nothing like Fallout 1 &amp; 2. And the series has gotten worse and worse since then, excluding Fallout New Vegas, which of course wasn't developed by Bethesda.
---
The Overseer would not approve.
---
You're clearly not understanding me. Nvm.
---
This game has been universally hated since it came out, except for idiots who thought it was gonna get better after...idk a year now?
---
Well. Is it better?
---
Hay is not cow feces.... its hay...
---
We received hundreds of hours of entertainment from this game (as good or bad as it was/is)
---
Seems that much of the community‚Äôs frustration stems from what the game can become with moderate effort.  And that‚Äôs the accent the community should be making
---
12 bucks? Dang I paid 17 for the month. I think it's worth the month for the kickass armor and atoms. Didn't try the scrap box yet
---
I really wish I waited to get it.  I lost probably a half million worth of scrap, including 4k flux.  Really unprofessional, how could they fuck this up so badly.
---
What do you think this post will accomplish? Do you honestly think someone at Bethesda is gonna see this and be like, "OMG guys we've been doing this wrong the whole time, some random asshole #3456 just made a post on reddit warning us about what the player base might do!"  It won't do shit, it's your money they're after, that's all they care about. It blows my mind I'm explaining this to an adult. It's not a revelation, and frankly it's depressing seeing these posts.
---
Much like the Vault Project itself...the Vaults were never meant to save anyone, they were just a means of gathering data... :)
---
For me, that last point is the most powerful and relevant one. If Bethesda turns a profit on this new model (they will), it will likely set a clear precedent for how they run games they make in the future. 
---
I'm pretty afraid that this is just *the* new normal for future Fallout games. If that's the case, I'm not coming back, either. I like Fallout 76-- I really do. But for $12.99/month, I can get a great new game every few weeks. It just isn't a sustainable model for anyone.
---
Kind of, yeah. The game has improved a lot.
---
Nah, they're legit new players that have no idea what they're doing
---
None of you will survive my bloodied explosive shovel!
---
Well I have 3k+ hours in fo4 and I can mod it where I have an unlimited build budget for my settlements. Just modding it in general is a huge plus. Fo76 on the other hand is an online game with limited build limits in the camp (which sucks) has some dope enemies (mothman I'm looking at you!) You meet many amazing people (and some angry crybabies) and it's just a nice fun experience. So it depends on what you like. If you don't want to be near anyone and okay alone get fo4, if you want to play online than get fo76.
---
Not forcing, more like very strongly suggesting. Basically, the ones that refuse to pay will have to deal with more bugs, annoying mechanics and will have to wait huge amounts of time for simple things. Like in a mobile game, except this one costs $60 and is broken AF!
---
Don' t really expect folks to care, but the reason players who bought Fallout First subscriptions are being attacked is the same reason people who cross picket lines during a strike are: by supporting what is, IMHO, the most predatory, least honest and downright despicable subscription service I've ever seen... you are justifying its merit and sending the message to all AAA designers: Don't worry about quality. Don't worry about gameplay. Don't worry about polish. Don't worry about giving me value as a gamer... Just take any treasured IP, slap it on a can of diaherra, and charge me $100 for it - I will pay it.
---
You're free to do what you want with your money, but people are also free to judge you for it. Have some self-respect, respect your free time more... and demand a little better before you give up the goose. Because your support of this garbage will insure we never get another genuinely good game. I mean, put yourself in Bethesda's shoes: why would you bother investing time and effort into a quality product when you know your fanbase will just give you $100 for a can of diarrhea? "In the time it would take us to make 1 quality product... we can make 10 cans of diarrhea and these sheep will pay for it."... so all we're going to get is diarrhea going forward, and it's your fault. Can you see why we might be a bit annoyed?
---
Imo, Bethesda fucked up, they broke almost every promise they made to us before the game was released. It's still a huge buggy mess over a year later, and when one of their bugs causes issues for their players, there attatude is "oh, too bad, good luck with that".
---
On top of this, they want us to pay more money monthly, for a game that is bearly playable, just so we can play in our own server, while they almost ignore current issues just to release new paid content constantly.
---
I also think that, ignoring any other issues in the game, ect, $20 a month for what their offering is pretty reasonable, and I always suspected the private servers were going to be paid since E3.
---
Finally, they said they are going to be very open to player feedback, and where better to provide feedback others that a page on the internet dedicated to the game itself? And Reddit pages for games is a place where many, if not most Devs and companies look for feedback.
---
It very much has a firefly feel to it.
---
What is that supposed to be?
---
You hit the nail on the head. I think you're really right. 
---
But following that logic, Bethesda should *ideally* look at this subreddit and think, "oh shit. These people have been riding our dicks over a shitty game and now they're pissed off. If even *they* are taking issue, maybe something is wrong with our revised model."
---
Hopeful thinking, I guess.
---
I have started fallout with fallout 4 maybe be it's why. It was a buggy but good universe
---
I noticed too
---
I don't think Bethesda at this point cares about the Future of Fallout 76. I think they have finally given up on it and are just trying to make as much money off of us as they can before it completely dies. It honestly wouldn't surprise at this point if they just flat out cancelled Wastelanders and walked away. After all we haven't gotten shit for content this past year besides a couple events and Nuclear Winter which is all but dead in its own right.
---
Playing outer worlds atm, and it is the single player fallout experience
---
Nothing said was false, though. Even in your characterization of what's being said, they are literally saying factual things.
---
And the skeletons are...?
---
PART OF IT!
---
So Grafton's mayor constantly blabbering isn't easy to fix? The power armor bug wasn't an easy fix? (Was around for months also) The fast travel bug shouldn't be easy to fix? You can't argue that some things are easier than others when some bugs were so small and just a big inconvenience and they still haven't fixed them. If it doesn't make them money, it's not a priority.
---
I have not played any borderlands...how were the first two?
---
Yeah i plan on scrapping my entire server tonight
---
PS4? Got any cool legendaries you wouldn‚Äôt mind donating?
---
I wonder if they still bring up the canvas bag thing
---
Who are these gamers that don't use the internet/social media?  
---
This was probably true back when I was pissed about the bugs in Beetle Adventure Racing, but not now.
---
So how do you feel supporting these terrible actions though?
---
Search it up, it's been asked to be fixed for the longest time. And you must strictly be a pve player, it was mostly abused in survival mode.
---
I feel like you aren‚Äôt Understanding‚Ä¶ When you prioritize bug fixes you look at both severity and complexity. That bug was clearly not severe.
---
And the power armor bug they said was complex if you followed anything
---
You are officially the biggest dumbass on this sub. I hope you are not this dense out in the world. This affects everyone. They said we couldn't get unlimited junk because it will cause the servers to crash. Suddenly that feature is behind a paywall. As more and more features get requested to the game, they will start putting those behind a paywall if said paywall makes them enough money from people who buy it. It turn, those idiots who bought the subscription ACTUALLY are affecting those people who didn't. By being a intelligent human being, if you don't buy the subscription, they will put the features in the base game. But I have seen where you said you had bought it, so I know which category you fit in...
---
Yup. I said when it came out this shit was going to be bad but no one would listen. I'm a huge fallout fan but I could see this hot mess a mile away. I'm gladly I saved the money
---
Sounds like fraud.
---
Free scrap bot here too, checking in. It basically cost me a week's atom challenges. Wasn't even all of them, just the ones I wanted to do.
---
Seriously though I've noticed more too. There where more than 5 who were under level 5 on a server and I haven't seen that since the free to play promo. This is on ps4.
---
Get game pass for PC for $1 for the first month. Doesn't go to Epic and its a freakin dollar (5 bucks for each subsequent month). Its a steal!
---
Neverbeenoutsidebefore
---
Plus 1
---
Thank you guys for sharing. Oooh I like the evil pumpkin and the silly ones: happy &amp; surprised.
---
Btw this stuff is already in the camp building menu and I met JES-2R at Freddy Fear's.
---
Rushed by BGS the publisher...
---
Don‚Äôt plan on renewing but really enjoying the unlimited scrap. Its a shame they don‚Äôt provide this for everyone.
---
Alright then we'll just agree that the game breaking immortality bug isnt severe also even though it's still here 6 months after. üëç If it doesn't make 'em money, it's not severe.
---
It goes to Obsidian, who is supporting Epic. Figure the people on /r/Fo76 by this point would get not wanting to support greedy developers or an anti consumer store front.
---
I don't like the guy's videos anyway, he's always shouting
---
I think that the idea that, "If this individual post won't change the actions of a massive gaming company, it's worthless and annoying to even post" is both cynical and stupid. 
---
There's no harm in voicing our concern, and there's also no harm in me taking five minutes to type out a post highlighting that I've seen this sub support the game for quite some time and it's concerning to see so much anger at Bethesda. 
---
No, they won't change anything to post this. The Bethesda employees who frequent the sub probably won't even open it. But as a point of discussion, I don't see why it makes you so upset that I even posted it in the first place. I want to talk about the potential impacts on the fo76 community of Bethesda's revised monetization model. 
---
No need to become "depressed" at seeing a post you disagree with.
---
&gt; No no no, Fallout 76 is not free to play, It doesn't fucking matter if past F2P games were P2W or not. This is a AAA game that charged $60 
---
So they charged the same as a single player game that runs completely on your own system and allows you unlimited access to their servers for no ongoing prices.  As far as online games goes, that's damn near free to play.  For most online games, historically, buying the game MIGHT get you 1-3 months access, and ONLY in the first region until you buy the expansion packs.
---
&gt; that is now introducing a subscription model that IS P2W. You get an unlimited stash size now while everyone else is heavily limited, you get to freely enter a private world now gathering all the materials you want, all the workshops you want and all the legandary farming you want. THIS IS NOT A MINOR CONVENIENCE.
---
But how does any of that make you "win"?
---
And they announced that private servers were coming eventually before the game even launched.  If you thought those were going to be free you were delusional.
---
I did because it was nice to played. Even with bugs I had some fun. But making us paying more, lying to us, instead of fixing noooo thx
---
People acting like paying for a hosted server is a problem. Thats the problem. Paying for server space is how its works
---
I blame players who say stupid shit like, "the subscription's worth it because it makes the raids playable."
---
That's retardation right there folks.
---
 I bought it and traded 556 for it, mostly on this website
---
I've seen a lot players below level 20. I'm on PS4 too
---
I will admit, i subbed for the outfit and atoms and immediately cancelled. it's exactly as the initial testers said - the scrap box randomly eats your items, (tested it for shits and giggles) and the 'private world' is just some old instance, with dead giveaways like finding someone's generators all over the ammo factory when logging in.
---
there is zero real value to this idiotic subscription service which is why they put the outfit and some atoms on it.
---
GJ Bethesda, if all they did was add the outfit to the store for the same price as the sub people wouldn't be rightly lampooning them like this.
---
Supposedly, but only one way to really find out. Offer a sacrifice.
---
not for you and me.
---
The fallout sale happening rn.
---
Yeah, I think you're right. Bethesda is just trying to milk the dying franchise. 
---
It does just kind of make me sad. So much personal nostalgia is packed into a series which Bethesda doesn't seem interested in really preserving.
---
I pity the marks, but it's their money to burn.
---
Holy shit this is a next level of dense. Go play your shit game, Bethesda gleefully accepts your money.
---
As a person that world hops to farm scrap, this isn't true
---
Awesome, thanks Dr. Nick!
---
The definition of a safe space.
---
It‚Äôs sad to know that there are people willing to spend 18 dollars on a skin in a dead game.
---
No, all of the gear will die with the game, or rent the gear for 12.99 a month. Geez, these posts sure are original, haven't seen it 10 times already.
---
I personally have my son join me he likes the game more than me. I am less social and been waiting for features like this
---
Can I offer you an egg in this trying time?
---
Is there a difference between Fallout First and ESO-plus?
---
And I gleefully give it, because I understand how online games work.
---
Go back to single player.
---
&gt; total disregard for actual, living human beings.
---
Considers himself not a human being, interesting note that down.
---
Seriously dude, if you pay 100 bucks per year or 12.99 per month for this, your rights are similarly violated as any of the hong kong protestors.
---
its like mass effect, borderlands and fallout had an orgy. its amazing.
---
You‚Äôre a real veteran guy o7
---
I guess if you wanna let Bethesda scam you out of $13 a month or $100 or whatever, feel free. ESO at least offers access to the expansions in their scam. 76 has nothing to offer, because it‚Äôs not an MMO like the other games you mentioned.
---
Yes I see this in multiple youtubers videos makes me mad
---
What part of looking at severity and complexity do you not understand? Something can be severe but it‚Äôs overly complex which means it‚Äôs not an easy fix. Similarly something can be not severe and therefore won‚Äôt be prioritized against something that is a bigger issue. The scrap box thing sounds like it was severe and not an overly complex thing to fix... hence why it was prioritized.
---
Clearly an immortality bug would be severe... but may take longer to fix due to complexity.
---
Bethesda started it.
---
You will surely get twenty worth of entertainment out of it.
---
Aren't most just constantly farming world bosses and old content? Why have unlimited or large extra space? What else is there to do? Not being sarcastic, just generally curious
---
The point is that someone could easily agree with the animal skins being unethical and not think anti-consumer matters at all. So its either a bad comparison or just a random statement you felt like making.
---
What you described would, in fact, be an amazing world for US.  However Bethesda wouldn't be getting paid.
---
Oh I mean they would...but once.  They wanted a continuing stream of revenue.   They wanted to jump on the "live service" band wagon.
---
The rest, as they say, is history...
---
It gives me something to do and it is there when I need it. I need to repair my weapon, I got the stuff, I need to build a whole suit of ex power armor like last night, I got the stuff, I want to build 300 water purifiers on my base, I got the stuff. I don‚Äôt keep track of what I even have, I just enjoy going to a city or something and grabbing everything.
---
This was an excellent read into how someone in the hole views others.
---
Oh, it really is
---
Pretty much
---
Original, kinda like the "that'll cost 12.99 a month" post that you just made? No one has seen that.
---
that is an opinion, not a false statement. Many online services offer free server space. Further, many paid servers do not require every player on the server to pay for the servers, only the host. It is not misinformation to react to these facts negatively. 
---
It would be misinformation if they claimed Bethesda was doing anything different than what they are actually doing.
---
You said it's incredibly useful but doesn't actively fuck over others who don't have it. How that makes any sense, I've yet to find out. I'll buy the subscription when it doesn't give me an advantage over people who can't afford the subscription. I don't really want my own server anyway, but would gladly take the monthly atoms if they put the armor in the shop, scrap box in base game, and tent behind a quest with skins in the shop.
---
The mod heather
---
It wasn't greedy, it was a deal made to secure much-needed finances. Steam wants 30% upfront discounted down to 12% if Obsidian sells enough units. Epic is only charging them 8% and guarantees sales up to a certain amount of units. Exclusivity sucks but that's on Epic not Obsidian. Obsidian did what was best for their studio.
---
South most savage divide
---
Absolutely
---
I don't get the hate for Bethesda. Isn't is zenimax we should be hating on? Bethesda games were great before they were absorbed into the collective.
---
My only hope for these changes is that people who have a place to put all their horded scrap that they will possibly never use in one sitting, will take all their caps, and not worry about using them or losing them in pvp. Go forth and fight to your hearts content knowing you can make all you lose back in a blink of an eye on your private server.
---
But, really. Use this to get geared out and get better at pvp. I have a feeling they might try and add some kind of arena style pvp once NW becomes long in the tooth.
---
I play 'em both. I like 4 for the mods and I like 76 because of the homies
---
Nobody is asking you to enjoy the game. It is not a scam if it is valued to me at a higher price already. I get my unlimited scrap storage and peace of mind while I own all workshops. That alone is more than worth it without the outfit. But hey nobody is telling you to enjoy the things I get enjoyment out of. 
---
Only you are arguing with yourself still playing this game you can't seem to help but talk down on. You are fickle and will keep on playing so feel free to leave your fickle opinion to yourself cause it will change week to week as most of the children in this community.
---
Fortnite also has tons of free skins you can obtain from playing that aren't at a $10 price tag. fo76 is charging $5 for Beehive hair from FO4
---
It never put me in a different server so far i have 2 accounts so i could anker it if i want i am a mellee build and have tons of repair kits so i dont bother with workshops
---
Change server from your friends list and find a server with enemies. Watch captainoobs weapon spotlights and find your weapon to do more missions etc
---
I paid $20.. ü§£
---
&gt;The fact that paying 12$ a month magically makes server performance issues due to stash non-existent means they have been lying to us the entire time.
---
This is actually my main gripe with Fallout 1st.   They lied about storage space. Also limited space for junk is a real problem in the base game.  I can't imagine anything scummier than putting a problem in the base game, then offering to fix it with a monthly fee.   The scrap stash should be part of the base game.
---
I'm sorry, but could you clarify this?  Is the Battle Royale mode not free to play?  If you've bought the game I mean?
---
This sounds like another variation on the morons defending Fallout 1st. 
---
&gt; "Bethesda is just doing this to secure much needed finances, subscription models sucks but this is just how it is. They are doing what's best for the game and to keep improving it."
---
Guys don't jump off this abusive train and go onto another, Indie developers are the only ones who have a valid reason to take the Epic deal. Obsidian releasing a new RPG on Steam and the MS store wasn't going to suffer in the least bit. They are just taking advantage of a shit ton of cash and the ability to double dip next year when the game hits Steam.
---
if this bothers you, don't comment.
---
Also not speaking up isn't how this works anymore. Remember battlefront II and the casino of loot boxes? if nobody said anything then, do you think you would be just receiving your card perks now? NO, you would be revealing a card that would need to be unlocked within a .01% chance loot box. Guess again about staying silent.
---
This is the endgame of "games as a service" regardless of the developer. we're getting a helpful preview. And it fucking sucks.
---
You didn't really answer how this is "pure Fallout" though. Having a story and stuff to do isn't a Fallout specific thing, literally any RPG fits all these examples minus emerging from a vault is in every RPG out there.
---
Additionally, the majority of what you named isn't even in most the Fallout games. Scrapping items isn't in 6/9 games. Emerging from a vault isn't in 4/9 games. Improving gear isn't in 5/9 games. Camps aren't in 8/9 games and settlement building isn't in 6/9 games.
---
I don't have a problem with you liking the game, but your description would be inseparable from Borderlands, AC, literally any RPG minus the camp and vault aspect.
---
So I'll ask again: what IS pure Fallout? Is it copy-paste every generic RPG that exists? And if so, why not go with literally anything else?
---
Sounds about right.
---
Many places offer free space. Large majority dont. Its not an opinion that server space costs money that's a fact and you know it so I'm done here.
---
My original point was I wish people would bitch about the actual problems
---
Re-read my post, i said it‚Äôs useful but have lived without it. YOU made the comment about it f***** others over and i asked how... it doesn‚Äôt specifically give you any advantage over me if you have more junk.... its handy but not a real advantage.
---
&gt; Bethesda doesn't give a shit about Reddit posts
---
&gt; I think that it's still worthwhile to express my opinion
---
No offense bro, but they don't give a damn about your opinion either, on top of Reddit/the internets. They have forgotten the way, and now walks the path along the likes of EA. I'm starting to think that once a studio gets big enough to make AAAs, it's inevitable.
---
Oh, I was too, constantly buying the Atom Shop bundles whether I wanted the outfit or not. Then the same day they released the full price glorified reskin of the fridge, I crashed five times in five minutes at Fort Defiance. Since then, they haven't got a cent out of me. When they make the game stable and they make the subscription only a private server and some atoms, then I'll get the subscription. I don't even have use for a private server, but would gladly take the monthly atoms.
---
Bethesda wants to know the location of your wallet. Also would you be willing to pay for a lube upgrade or are you fine with being bent over dry?
---
I might‚Äôve not read it right, but are you saying hay is cow crap?
---
Lol get out of my head!
---
Came here to say this, but you beat me to it. 
---
Loving TOW right now. Haven't had this much fun with a Fallout like game since New Vegas.
---
You're like, the 20th person posting this. 
---
I'll have you know, if there IS anyone else to give you stuff, it's all gonna be crap.
---
Sorry, but you've missed your gold rush, cowboy.
---
How do you use the tent? I couldn‚Äôt figure it out.
---
&gt;It doesn't say they will stop spending money, it says the wallet is already closed.
---
except the wallet wasn't "already closed", it closed because of this bs decision.
---
you can't use a consequence of a decision as an argument for taking it..
---
I bought 1st and love it.
---
Cannot place Item:  Intersects with an existing object
---
losing all your items because you thought you didn't have to worry about stash space, but guess again the infinite stash is bugged and it empties itself upon logging out of the game :D
---
Haha have you *ever* had a girlfriend. You were excited to play with the workshops all by yourself? In this MULTIPLAYER game?! What‚Äôs the point then? Play 4 and have all that, plus a smoother experience.
---
It is not fixed. The only way I was able to shut him up was to pick up the remains and just keep them forever.
---
Go to your favourites wheel (F on PC), and then it should tell you on the bottom bar (T on PC).
---
Everything you are describing is a problem of corrupt government.
---
I mean, they certainly don't give a shit about my opinion. 
---
I don't lose anything from expressing it, though. And creating a space where we can have a dialogue about the direction we fear the Fallout franchise is heading seems like a worthwhile endeavor, right?
---
Obsidian actually has a good game to show for their business decision, and no predatory microtransactions / live service model. It's not even remotely similar. Bethesda used to be a name that evoked positive sentiment, but have shown time and again that they no longer deserve that reverence. Obsidian's only major transgression is agreeing to an objectively better financial deal with Epic than they would have gotten releasing on Steam.
---
Yes but for the week of e3 that mode alone was free to everyone and I think the game would benefit of it had stayed that way.
---
Yes.  One wonders what happens if your Scrapbox gets destroyed and you are unable to replace it, though.
---
Oh sweet thanks :).
---
Right, you get it! This is how the vast majority of private companies work, just so you're aware.
---
doesn't that just mean the server you're in is older than others?
---
I was always in PA too, due to weight restrictions.   Now,  with the scrap box,  i can unload and get out of that PA.  I love it.
---
To each their own.  I have no problem that people really enjoy this game.  I tried really hard to be one of them, but at just about every turn I was disappointed.  I have played all past versions of this game and loved them all.  Probably logging more hours than I care to admit.  I might be able to get past all of the bugs and poor decisions if Bethesda was the company I thought it was in the past.  Pulling something like a subscription service though after everything thing they have said?  I am dumbfounded.  I am utterly disappointed.  This is something EA would do if they could get away with it.  
---
We can't let gaming companies get away with these things in my opinion.  I said it when they first started introducing quality of life improvements items in the Atom store.  If you accept it they will keep pushing the envelope.  Now here we are because the overall player base accepted it.  Now they pushed it a little more.  I don't want to know what is next.
---
Do you have any proof of this or is this just another excuse?
---
Enjoy losing 100 bucks a year to this shitshow then!
---
It isn't back after the "hotfix?"
---
The overseer quest will lead you to others.
---
Stay in the Forrest until you have grasped the game. Collect everything as you'll need it. A camp isn't super important,  just use the overseers or flatwoods for crafting &amp; scrapping unless you move more north then it's just handy as a free fast travel location. To get those early legendaries, look out for leader of the pack.
---
You want to know my opinion? R A N G E R  A R M O R
---
The fact that you have to hey for a simple color change is downright insulting
---
Still playing.
---
I would say that on private servers, the game *is* noticeably smoother.
---
They're not afraid for the future of fallout 76. Fallout 76 is simply a test bed for how far they can push things beyond the line so that when they implement slightly less bad things in starfield, there's little to no backlash.
---
76
---
I don't even think the "private" servers should be there anymore. People argue that they need to sell them because servers aren't free but they literally give you some random world and it shuts down after you leave. It's not constantly running like ark, conans exiles or Minecraft. They literally removed survival servers just so they could sell them back to us.
---
You are a part of the problem, so expect to be treated as such.
---
Bethesda made it clear they are only going to listen to the dollar signs and you are giving them justification.
---
Kinda makes the whole salty Reddit karma whore thing look exactly like salty Reddit karma whores doesn‚Äôt it?
---
At this point its unbelievable that some people are still giving money to this company. They have lied and hustled the player-base through over priced atom shop items to dropping the price hours after release and now they have just monetized previously promised free content and made those still playing their shit game be at a disadvantage. At this point I am against the people that reinforce this type of shitty behavior but the name calling is uncalled for.
---
I agree
---
Fuck no! You still see the occasional T posing enemy or completely Frozen enemy
---
Bought 1st and a second copy of 76 in case my first copy gets scratched up.
---
Bethesda: According to our investigations, the players are just lying. Yup, we'll say that they are just lying. Good bye.
---
I like it. I'm farming the shit out of junk.  I've also been released from my power armor prison.   I likely won't renew needy month unless something amazing is offered.
---
That's a really interesting theory. Why do you think that? It seems like starfield has a smaller user-base. Why would Bethesda use one of their most popular franchises as a test?
---
Yeah.
---
When you're enabling the garbarge that are giving these Corporations the very misguided notion that Greed is okay you're not doing yourself or any of your  "fellow gamers" any favors.
---
Just saying........
---
or it's bethesdas twisted take on getting revenge on people who say "new vegas is the superior fallout game". a obsidian ranger witch hunt? lol!
---
joke aside, since survival is gone, there're a lot of goons out there who just wanna provoke a fight. a few days ago somebody apparently didn't like my prices and bombed my camp with a grenade launcher. just ignore them or hop servers.
---
It is called time management. I don't have long to play so when I do I want the most out of it. Nothing wrong with that. Keep insulting someone with more responsibilities than you, it only shows you are losing your own argument because you are stooping low and insulting a stranger for simply playing different than you. You must be a weak individual.
---
You can get banned from Xbox Live for doing this.
---
At this point I'd say it's a close call. Anthem's trying, but it'll probably be a "too little, too late" thing.
---
I don't agree we received hundreds of hours of entertainment. I spent most of my hours walking around in a dead world, while being overweight at 27 fps (144 in Overwatch on Ultra). The rest of my time I spent in my CAMP trying to find a way to make it less shitty with the limited amount of things we can build, because "game limitations". And I patiently waited for this game to improve, because I believed all the lies. It never did. Now that Bethesda openly admit defeat, I lost all hope. They are just going to milk the remaining audience and wrap it up.
---
I work for a software company and not only don't we trust our OWN sales/marketing guys, we consider them to be the true enemy rather than the customers ;)
---
I quit this game a long time ago for obvious reasons and Angry Joe was my favorite youtuber but i can agree. His first review of the game was so disgusting that i unsubscribed to him. Not that he was wrong about a lot of stuff, but i just hated that he kept mentioning the 16x the detail part and showing an unrendered road that to this day he keeps showing. I never once encountered that bug while playing Fo76, and the game has the most gorgeous graphics and atmosphere i ever encountered. Over time i went back to watching him and he is honest about a lot of stuff, just that when it comes to Fo76 he keeps showing bugs that got fixed the second day of launch. But the game is handled very poorly so youtubers will roast it in the worst way possible for legitimate reasons.

##JOE MAMA ü§£ü§£ü§£

This space has been that since 76 came out and they've gone straight up in the wrong direction from the wishes and desires in their community. It's not like this is the first time they've dun goofed here. I think the Fallout franchise is going to get whored out for the money at this point. Which sucks, because I played it back since I was a kid so it holds a lot of nostalgia.
---
Can't play it offline bruh
---
They do, I saw one yesterday.
---
You both get an upvote.
---
Well, they do pay him so hopefully he can soldier on :)
---
Savage, apt. FO1st is bullshit. Some perspective tho. I know several people playing FO76 and none of them payed full price. This game has such a bad reputation most players wait to get it used or on sale and refuse to pay over $20. And it's been that way for almost the whole time that game has been out. I got it for$17 and have enjoyed it well enough without spending an additional cent on it.
---
in this game, one uses a brahmin (among other things) to make fertilizer. Fertilizer is what you must use to make a hay bail in the halloween bundle just released. so yes.
---
LOL you guys are full of shit  
---
Gotta love kids just being contrary for the sake of it
---
Everyone would have to show at least screen shots of the uninstall or better still a video otherwise no one will believe it and just think it's a...
---
**Look at me!**
---
Not sure what you mean exactly. Commenting I was replying to was about how the private servers are just instances on the regular servers and you can end up in one someone or some people were just in.
---
You got it for 13 bucks a month. Great.
---
IMO the game is adding  a subscription model because copies aren't exactly flying off the shelves, microtransactions aren't being bought as much as they want (mostly because the stuff in the store is uninspired/ugly gutter shit but they haven't figured that out) yet it is still getting active development.
---
Maybe 15 years ago that would have been okay. But in 2019, with the games as a service train going full speed and the hobby completely exploited for maximizing profits, no AAA developer would let a game enjoy active development without a consistent revenue stream. Something that the atom store has failed to provide (because most of the stuff on it is stupid or ugly)
---
It is online only.  You cannot play offline.
---
We paid for this to be fixed quickly.
---
It's stupid as fuck and could easily be included for free
---
I honestly don't know how you're gonna pull it off, there's a login screen before you can even hit play. There is exactly one raid in the game at the moment, but a couple of bigger events that are next to impossible to do alone.
---
I think you might be out of luck sadly.
---
It is still bugged.
---
Because being able to craft more with less scrap runs because your scrap stash is now unlimited is totally not a real advantage over those who don't have the unlimited scrap box. Just because we've survived just fine without it so far, doesn't mean it's not a real advantage. We've survived just fine with all the bugs. That doesn't mean it's fine to keep them in the game.
---
Right, get this....
---
The CEO of Zenimax was BANNED FROM BANKING in a settlement with the fed in a civil suit over misrepresenting Arab ownership in the First American Bank.
---
Like how bad do you need to be to be banned from banking?
---
nahhh it just shows a list of folks that have said enough of this.  
---
Reddit on the whole is a LOOK AT ME lol
---
I know a lot of PR/Marketing guys who assure me that knowing "what's going on" actually hinders their efforts ;)
---
Whaaaaat??? For real? I haven't been following the game that much but I remember the announcement trailer said I could play offline like the other games right???
---
ur not mad about the subscription . somebody just sold you snake oil. you drank it. it poisoned you then they sold you painkillers. then fucking promised you'd get better then they ask you 13 a month for the cure. and you are not mad they did that. wow you'd be that person they rape then be happy about because your asshole never felt better then they raped you monthly over and over again and you coudl't complain. go choke on todds dickhole.
---
OP: "I'm fine so everything should be fine".
---
Sorry but no. that's not how it works sweety. Just because you weren't born in the age of actual video games means you get to say this era is decent. We used to get everything that was in FO76 bugfree and from day 1. not 5 years down the line and at a premium after paying a premium. DAY 1. I implore you, please play an old videogame and bask in the glory that things used to have. When games were much better, maybe graphically less, but they used to be much better
---
No. Really saps the motivation to keep at it.
---
One of the hidden benefits of lack of text chat on PC, hahah. You do you!
---
No the date has always been locked to the first day since the vault opened
---
Have you tried building *top down* by placing C.A.M.P up in a carriage or structure?
---
You keep rationalizing this all you want but you literally are doing what I was doing with Fallout 76 since it came out along with most people here burnt by Fallout 1st.
---
Outer Worlds might not be full of microtransactions but it's still giving a middle finger to consumers in its own special way that benefits them and not us. Whether it's a good game or not is irrelevant or justifying it.
---
Oh but it isn't the same now because you like Outer Worlds. Just like the people who liked Fallout 76 denying it wasn't the same as some other bs game too.
---
And? I paid 60$ for the game, does that mean they shouldn't quickly fix other game bugs? I don't understand your comment.
---
99, I paid for a full year just because of the salty Reddit karma whores.
---
Your a disgrace to the gaming industry... not that the rest are saints, but come on, wtf !?!?
---
I did the same and the thing is I really did not want to. With all the money and time I put into this game already this was it for me and I am having a hard time dealing with this. I don't play many other games these days and this was indeed enjoyable but I cannot help but feel like Bethesda is doing this on purpose.  
---
It's almost like they want to ruin this game so they can move on taking our money with them. I am so pissed of right now.
---
I played it for awhile and enjoyed it but after the multiple lies and scams from Bethesda around the Nuka cola and bag drama, I gave up, now it's becoming a subscription service, if they keep working on it then that's fine I guess, WoW is subscription based and you have to buy the base game
---
i dont see your request bud (or any request for that matter).
---
But the game is STILL broken and they expect you to pay 100$ for even MORE broken items. You can't actually be THIS delusional.
---
nope.. Fallout 76 is specially online. this games not for you
---
No.  Nothing tangible.   All intangible goods.
---
What "situation"?
---
console or pc?
---
Haha... now you‚Äôre just making stuff up. The comment literally is 
---
‚ÄùBethesda could not give a shit about people whos wallets are closed to them.‚Äù
---
Where does it say it closed because of this decision. It doesn‚Äôt say now closed or are closing... you‚Äôre just injecting your own opinion.
---
Isn't that Fallout 4 though
---
Ah so in a game sense yeah it‚Äôs fertilizer to make a hay bale
---
Honesty Beth has always, and I mean always, made shit games that needed community support just to run for longer than a few hours at a time,and I'm not even going to get into longevity. 76 is the first time Todd and the boys have had to make:
---
1) an actual functioning game without someone the community cleaning code and
---
2) an MMO.
---
Taking shit out on a player for spending 20+ just cuz you (not meaning you personally ) shelled $60 - $250 knowing full well Beth crappy publication history is childish. Hell, I pre-ordered, thought detter of it, cancelled, waited a week, saw the price drop and bought it all the while laughing cause I still got my pre-order beni's. That's I knew this was gonna be a standard Bethesda Softwork product without the community to hold thier hand. If you wanna blame someone, blame community for this not some guy in Dollar General NCR Ranger skin. We made Beth into the shitty software company that it is today the first time some modder fixed the shit storm that was Marrowind, or the golden child that is NV (read lots of sarcasm here). 
---
So the community can revlot all it wants, but truth is we made this mess don't blame Dollar Ranger. We dug our grave and Zenimax is pushing us to write our own tombstone.
---
The mods on this subreddit are nothing more than fed boys that will blindly defend this game to the last breath.
---
Most of them already left. Just compare this sub to /r/Fallout.
---
bye Felicia
---
And normalized through capitalism.
---
ive encountered zero legendaries and for the last two hour and half ive been logging into the same low level server. im level 200 and everything on the server is level 5 or lower. 
---
im encountering t-posing enemies and enemies sliding on the ground, as well as completely dead areas with bodies entirely looted even though i havent interacted with them.
---
i got a one month for atoms and out of sheer morbid curiosity but i never thought it would be this bad.
---
ive envountered zero legendary enemies and am now seemingly stuck permanently on a low level server.
---
definitely serves me right. fool me once shame on bethesda. fool me twice and i literally only have myself to blame. 
---
there may be a bunch of people bitching just for the sake of bitching, but in my opinion this is the purely lazy, thoughtless and greedy tactics. the company does not care. Ive asked for a refund and im very seriously considering uninstalling the game. im not big on knee jerk reactions so id like to wait and see what happens but honestly i feel stupid. i feel like bethesda employees are laughing at me. its a bad feeling and considering nobody has a gun to my head that just further amplifies the stupid feeling. why am i doing this to myself? or at the very least why am i letting them do this to me?
---
wanting to further monetize the game isnt the problem, its that they constantly try to do as little as possible to actually give you value equal to dollars spent. when are we going to start seeing quality for the money spent? its starting to feel like never
---
As a longtime fan with money to burn i find myself wondering "whats the point". i have no problem spending money, but not just to be laughed at. now not only am i laughed at my the community but by the developers themselves. they smirk as our junk is stolen from us for a price. Say what you will about EA but theyve never gone to this low of a level, they stay at a nice consistent level of shady. bethesda seems to be trying set a new bar completely.
---
The servers came back on but are still just as laggy as they were since the Patch 14. I went to WS to give it a try and got the "Server Not Responding" message more than 5 times, it didn't crashed and started responding again after the prompts, but unplayable due to the lagfest. 
---
I think I gonna stop playing for the next few days and gonna try again when the Halloween event starts, there's no point in trying to play a game with the servers as shitty as this.
---
I don't like Epic. I like Obsidian. I acknowledge that Obsidian would be leaving money on the table to deal with Steam rather than Epic. People don't like Epic exclusivity because it limits choice. Microsoft is offering TOW on their game pass, which offers a choice. I get to support Obsidian and *not* Epic and it only costs me a dollar. Seems like a win-win to me.
---
Pc
---
 AngryJoe ? Never heard of him and I'm not going to go look and give him clicks by judging what you're saying.
---
Fuck, this is exactly how I feel. It's really depressing.
---
I still need my PA to deal with my standard carrying capacities. 
---
8 different heavy weapons is likely a bit much, I suppose I don't necessarily have to carry around 100+ Fusion cores and Plasma cores, and I probably don't need almost 900 Stimpaks of varying type, but I'd rather have'em than not!
---
All Scrap Box has given me is the ability to largely empty my stash box, which isn't so bad I suppose. It's nice to have the option to store Legendaries when I'm Scrip capped for the day.
---
Anybody who pays for the First membership are nothing more than shills that was like the Bethesda screw their mother in front of them
---
You call 1/4 of a COD game roster full? You even have 8x the map size. You silly bean.
---
Where did they say they fixed it? I would like source material please for me own comfort LOL.
---
So do lots of people. Oh no, wait... I thought you said "I love The Outer Worlds!" Sorry, misread that title...
---
Welcome to the party!
---
Hear hear.
---
I might buy a second copy now
---
Too bad it isn't really private
---
Only for OP to probably to go back to playing 76 a week later and then maybe get a little outraged again when they screw up Wastelanders, inciting more futile reddit posts complaining about the game again rather than just tossing the game and the company that doesn't give a shit about them aside. People who still support this game and think Bethesda gives a fuck about them are part of the problem and why they keep doing shit like this....cause suckers keep buying into it and thinking complaining about it will do anything.
---
Bethesda : "those who payed 13 a month only get the see the new features and get access to the PTR"
---
Yeah but I don't have to pay 20-60 dollars to enter mcdonalds so it would only stand if it was a f2p game
---
I find the easiest way to tell if someone is new is how oblivious they are to a paper bag of goodies you're trying to direct them to.
---
I seriously wonder how much money they'll make off this service- I cant see it being enough to be worth (what was left of) their reputation.
---
That's a old ass fast travel bug that still has not been fixed. I've been getting it more and more often. Only way to clear it is to close the game out completely.
---
Oh some people definitely need to step outside the bubble (aka echo chamber). It‚Äôs just not who you think. 
---
Hint: it‚Äôs the same people directing their gamer rage at people who don‚Äôt have a problem paying for a service.
---
Last time I played, (yesterday) it wasn‚Äôt dead. Sorry bout your butthurt bro.
---
So instead of improving the game to what it should be they to attract more players they double down on milking the last few loyal fans still playing. They don't deserve the IP.
---
If you are on PC delete this game, if you are on console then do the same thing but if it's a physical copy catch the damn thing on fire
---
I haven't really run into any bugs (that I recognized as bugs at any rate) yet but I'm only 3h or so in.  The facial animations aren't so bad but the game does suffer greatly from the Oblivion era "Potato face" plague :(
---
*ZAX would not approve
---
it works with drugs.. i buy a gram of clams every weekend and announcing to my friends this is the end helps.. haven't stopped though.. real world
---
Well that's ghey. Now I have to go make sure my husband doesn't try and fall for Todd's tricks.
---
No; it is online only. You can, however, play solo quite easily. At most, you'll come across other people running around from time to time.
---
If people are playing the game and buying bling and skins then it is not dead by any usual metric.
---
I didn't even notice this oddity, thanks for pointing out we're actually moving ahead in time now
---
Well with tax I think I might have paid twenty also aha
---
Fun if you're an easily entertained 12 year old
---
That's fascinating.
---
Not I want folk people continue to play this game despite Bethesda being corporate scumbags. Play a real RPG I like the outer worlds
---
&gt;It seemed pretty clear to me after reading the press release that the private server **is new and still developing tech**. Adjustments and additions are on the way.
---
I'm glad we're paying to test there game.
---
I guess, but a list really accomplishes nothing and as you say Bethesda aren't going to even notice it.
---
Oh well.
---
Havent you been blasting it on other posts? I agree with this post but, like at this point, wtf bro?
---
Ok I have about 200 space left ima try to pedal for Halloween
---
Not my experience at all.  The only flora I can't farm is stuff I've already farmed.
---
Honestly I would consider 76 to be a greater blunder for Bethesda and Zenimax than Anthem was to Bio-ware and EA.
---
Anthem was at least able to shed some light on bad development practices. The game had plenty of issues but the whole package ended up more competently delivered than Fallout 76.
---
Fallout 76 has made Bethesda look greedy and above all, wildly incompetent. Every aspect of this games existence has had issues. From launch day issues experienced with the launcher to breeches in customer security on their website. Broken promises in game, in their future plans, and in their accessories. Now after all that they have the gall to ask for more money for features that were promised before the game launched and they don't even live up to the bare minimum standard for what they are.
---
Say what you will about public opinion for EA. Bio-ware looks like the victim in their scenario. Bethesda is straight up the perpetrator and their reputation has been permanently tarnished.
---
I paid full price and still don‚Äôt care about paying extra for my own server. 
---
What this is really about isn‚Äôt ethics or morality, it‚Äôs about a well known socialistic segment of society that feels entitled. That segment of society is extremely active on Reddit, as demonstrated.
---
Is anyone in Australia actually paying this? Way too expensive
---
I'd say (only 3h or so in mind you) that the combat and gunplay is fairly comparable to FO4/Fo76 combat/gunplay.  It's damning with faint praise I admit but it's nowhere near as bad as the Fo3/NV combat.
---
Its not subscription service, you can pay to have a private server or you can just play on a public server.
---
What in the hell have they done to Fallout?! Why couldn't they just expand on an already well-established, beloved franchise and take it into the modern graphics we now enjoy. I would pay good money for an Obsidian remaster of New Vegas. If it's not broken, please don't try and fix it.
---
100% agreed. If this was just a 'atom shop subscription' I would have no problem with it.
---
My problems with it are the development time and resources being put into creating activities, objects, and engagements that are only available to subscription paying members in direct conflict with EVERYTHING they promised at launch.
---
My problem is being lied to.
---
I'm enjoying the savings on atoms, the dances are great, even if it is just to troll on the anti-1sters in game. I feel the QoL improvements should've been made available for everyone, even if it was in the atom store a la controversy fridge.
---
Well on that I am afraid we shall have to disagree.  Companies are comprised of people, who should (although might not) have morals.  Whilst I will agree that the reviewer had a penchant for the dramatic, I disagree that they deliberately exaggerated.  There are several 'faces' of Bethesda, who have made promises in the past and then gone back on them, very publicly.  That shows a lack of morals in my mind, so in that respect I partially agree with the reviewer, if not their dramatic overtones.
---
I get that you like the game, and for some reason are taking it personally that someone has a different opinion to you.  But respectfully, the state of the game is not really up for debate.  It is a buggy mess.  It has been since launch.  And when I returned to play, I was experiencing the exact same bugs that were there 10 months ago.  Things that should have been fixed.
---
And it is quite obvious that there is little point in continuing this line of discourse, so I won't be checking back in.  Have a lovely time in the wasteland (no sarcasm, I genuinely mean it.  I am honestly happy other people can find enough fun there to fill a years worth of play time, as the community is easily the best thing about the game), and as I have said before, hopefully I will be back if Wastelanders fixes the current state of the game, and provides the community with the game they should have had at release.  
---
Because at the end of the day I do love the Fallout franchise, if not the recent business practices of the company, and I want the game to succeed; I want to come back and play a fully fleshed out AAA game.
---
Yes when the server starts up, I'm pretty sure I remember the date moving forward depending on how long its been up
---
You and Obsidian don't actually know what is being left on the tablet by ditching Steam. Metro is the first game to have done it and we haven't had it hit Steam yet to find out what kind of response it will get. It could come out DOA sitting in the red.
---
 We don't have user reviews on the Epic store so we don't even know what the state of these games could be, Epic doesn't release sales figures so we have no idea if these games are even doing well. Chances are the contract they sign forbids them from sharing this information to the public.
---
You are supporting Epic by supporting Obsidian, because them getting sales regardless tells them the Epic deal is worth it and this plague carries to other games. What incentive does anyone have to not take the Epic deal if morons will give them money no matter what?
---
You are so right.
---
Attacking poeple because they bought this is wrong but they all should know what they are causing with this.
---
Lmao ‚Äúpay very close to this reaction.‚Äù You really think they give a shit about some reddit posts that make no impact whatsoever? Fuck no people will still buy it
---
This is the first time it's happened for me, but closing it out didnt work, I had to reset my ps4 entirely :/
---
Are you saying 3 is the first one?
---
NVM my mistake, i must have missed that part lol
---
It‚Äôs awesome people who enjoy this have a space for them to do so. It‚Äôs unfortunate, however, that people are supporting a developer that have such a low bar in caring about their end users. It‚Äôs sad that we can‚Äôt stand united for higher standards.
---
https://youtu.be/Eo3jslsZ1vo
---
Nah that really doesn‚Äôt happen at all man it‚Äôs locked on the day the vault opened
---
You‚Äôre gonna sit there and watch them hump the corpse.
---
Which armor should I invest in?
---
It is if you don‚Äôt invite a bunch of people in and leave them there.
---
After everything dodgy that's been around FO76 adding private servers to the base game would have been a better move, you're essentially paying 100$ a year for a server, if you get 12 months worth as the cheaper option
---
This is considered fraud btw
---
i see a wall of text.
---
i can do what you did in just one :)  
---
"the BR is the only 'fun' they they EVER did to the game all else is waste of time cus all servers will die in 2025"
---
If you are really going to uninstall  meet me at WS and give me all your top guns and armor(AS YOU WILL NOT NEED THEM ANY MORE) and I will give detail to all of the remaining players of your true valant sacrifice of ending your game
---
Wrong, although I see where you're coming from.
---
Everything on XBOX's side is going perfectly fine. It's just a bug in the Fallout '76 code that is causing Atoms &amp; Cosmetics to stay on the account.
---
You may get account banned in Fallout 76 though. You can just login to a 2nd XBOX account and play on that if you do.
---
No. If you buy it you are part of the problem, whether you want to admit it or not
---
I have found that the more you explain a joke, the funnier it gets...maybe.
---
The fact that you have to do that just to get a repair kit makes it extremely tempting for people just to go into the atomic shop to buy them since it a million times easier
---
Especially when they run away as soon as you pull your gun out to shoot the bag so they can see it. I had a pack of them scatter like roaches when I whipped out my .50 cal. Guess they thought I was about to unload on them. lol
---
It's totally doable as a solo player, aside for the Queen the Raid in Arktos and some of the harder events. You'll need people for that.
---
Not playable "offline" though.
---
Ex-Blizzard employees (important ones) confirmed this- they said Blizzard was doomed the moment they handed operations to the finance guys.
---
That doesn't change the fact that the game is still crap.
---
"Multiplayer" is a feature, and should never be a pre-requisite.
---
I bought this game with the intent to play a story-line, but it turns out they swung wide away from the rest of the franchise, and pretty much skipped any real story. The story is whatever they change it to.
---
I'm betting that a lot of people bought this game thinking that single-player would be the focus, and "Oh yeah, there's multi-player too."
---
I've got a couple:
---
Did the loading times improve at all? if so, by how much you noticed?
---
Can you do anything straight after world loaded? (i can't fast travel for a few seconds and my weapon is always empty, also first shots i shoot cause little damage)
---
Sorry totally wrong comment lol
---
Trolls gonna troll I guess. Now point on the doll where the bad Bethesda touched you.
---
Damn, if I had to do that every time that happed I'd of uninstalled this game back in February. Luckily just closing it out has worked for me so far.
---
"No children, come back! Survival mode isn't even a thing anymore!!!"
---
PS.
---
**Look at me! :D**
---
[Me!](https://imgur.com/gallery/KVmTm51)
---
Check out Morgantown, there are a lot of events around that area that may be feasible for low end players. 
---
Also, find a train station and look at all the posters, a few of them begin side quest lines that are pretty fun.  Sheepsquatch Ate My Brother, Pioneer Scouts (backpack and mods from this one), Nukashine (make some brewskis).  You can begin these, but may need a few levels to finish them off, but they will help you get there.
---
Before it was a literal wall of text, but what this really is is a big fat wall of opinion, and I‚Äôm happy to see yours displayed above
---
Wow that certainly makes the fact that they have non cosmetic items behind paywalls totally fine/s
---
It‚Äôs dead to him, that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so salty. He thinks everyone should feel the same way as him.
---
It can't happen because Bethesda need to hire workers that sort your junk that's why the monthly payment to pay their wages/s
---
It cost them NOTHING to allow unlimited materials but they put it behind sub like it would cost manpower to pull off. I'm fine with private servers (proper servers) being behind sub as well as cosmetics that they put dev work into...but storage? Really?
---
You guys just wait...I GUARANTEE YOU they will add camp budget limit increase with sub. They are doing it in ESO together with the storage. F76 will eventually follow.
---
Ouch! That sucks! Hopefull they can reverse it for ya. Everything seems to be back on yet i still dont have my stuff. From what i gathered Beth is calling it a "visual bug". Definetly not the case since its gone, unable to be used, nothing visual about this. Only reason i found out is because i needed to fix a turret and wanted to do sone halloween decorating, and i couldnt fix my turret or decorate. I put in a ticket but how can they get back your stuff since i wasnt expecting the game to eat things and with no pic/video proof. I set up a test to see if it stays but im not trusting it at all.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA LOL, falls to ground and daisies come up.
---
I love how the subscription was announced right before outer world released. That‚Äôs essentially business suicide. I loved this game.
---
Also. After starting outer world, holy hell does it make fallout look like a steaming pile of shit. I put up with the under par combat and glitches because of the nostalgia, but never again. And they‚Äôre making the next Skyrim on the same engine? Just stop completely. I won‚Äôt be buying Bethesda again, right beside blizzard
---
Got to admit, I was waiting as well. I still dive into Fallout 4 every now and again, even bought stuff from the cursed "Creation Club" when stuff went on discount, just to show a little extra support/love for that, waiting for the day Fallout 76 lands on its feet and figures out what it wants to be. 
---
...clearly they haven't a clue. &gt;\_&lt;
---
I mean, literally, all they had to do was NOT monetize any of what they're offering - and people would've done GANGBUSTERS for the game! THEN you could snag them in with some cosmetic fun stuff.
---
This? This is like releasing a copy of a Diablo game where anybody can join your group, but you can PAY for the option to NOT have them in your group and have friends only! The hell!? o\_O
---
I'm seriously thinking that this guy might be a bot
---
They made a premium service for a subscription, like ESO has. 
---
Fallout players want free stuff.
---
I believe this sub is honestly going to go the way of the anthem subreddit, where the developers and community managers got so fed up they started blacklisting the negative portion of the fanbase
---
What if you're a First Responder though?
---
I wouldnt even pirate this game, only if they payed me to.....
---
Every excuse the players have used defending Bethesda either makes them sound like drug addicts or people who are completely ignorant.
---
&gt;false advertising
---
That they bought into. XD
---
Im 99% sure it will
---
Oh boy, you really don't get it, do you?
---
Wow lol.
---
Sounds like a lot of broke people to me
---
Oh damn that‚Äôs stupid why they gotta make everything so difficult
---
I'll bring Chally's Feed.
---
It still displays on Console too.
---
I forsee the return of survival at a later date, probably why this is still there.
---
You are right insulting players who bought this "feature" is a bad thing to do.
---
But you also have to be aware of why they are doing this. You are supporting this kind scam with your money and if enough people do that other game companies will do the sama as Bethesda. Thats why it is important to stand united against something like this.
---
Of course insulting is not the right way and I am sorry you have experienced something like this. The best way would be to have a good conversation about this game and hopefully to convince you to drop Fallout First.
---
But that is not my place to do as I have never played Fallout76 and never will. I am only a player worried that other comapnies will do the Bethesda Scam and ruin more games.
---
\#Imaygooutsidesometime

im still living in the past, hopefully one day i can join you in the present

https://ibb.co/6FFCm3X
---
(on a serious note, fuckin nice! cant wait tell mine updates)
---
&gt; I paid $60 for the game, and **will pay inflated prices for** ***good*** **cosmetics,** 
---
Lol, you have only yourself to blame for this and industry trends. Don't cry about the problem when you are it.
---
It is, but first you must deposit 25 stable violet flux to appease the scrapbox god.
---
no, your not.  It started at launch of 1st.
---
Game has hella new life right now.
---
All the negative spin has done the opposite of its intent.  It gave the game more exposure, and it also got a lot of new players interested.
---
I mentioned this 2 days ago and got bombarded with hatespew and downvotes.   Glad im not the only one that saw it.
---
OW is made less than a year after 76 but looks and plays in certain areas like its multiple years ahead of it too.  Its sad
---
Hello Mod. I do not know if you work for Bethesda or not, so, I will be civil.   
---
But thanks to this little stunt. I will no longer support your games. I have asked my family and friends to do the same, most have agreed. FO4 was the last money you will get from me.
---
At least his meat never spoils, so there's that.
---
I believe it has been
---
"they have no idea what they're doing" - that gave it away. Bethesda forced their devs to install the game and subscribe.
---
I'll take things that never happened for $500 Alex.
---
I bought a month's subscription after a few friends did. Literally just for the armor and to transfer my scrap. No, I will not be renewing.
---
Not one toxic player encountered in about 8 hours of gaming. Moreover, not a single one of my friends has gotten harassed.
---
I am playing TOW right now, but will leave my char logged in to F76 overnight to see if anyone messages me. I highly doubt anyone will.  
---
Will update this later with the results. Say what you will, but F76 has a kick-ass player base. Very friendly for the most part. 
---
Let the shills commence with the downvotes.
---
Um no I havent blasted it? I stated that the whole visual glitch was a lie and it was proven that was a lie but I've been in support of this since it dropped.
---
My friend just informed me he had his junk stored fine before maintenance. When he finally was able to log back in, it was gone. I really don't know. I just hope y'all don't experience the same.
---
Outer Worlds is the game we have been waiting for. No more money to Bethesda's Choice for Fallout 76, Now with 30% more corporate greed!
---
It might be a non-starter since you thought this was a game you could play offline, but - If you liked Fallout 3 and 4 or New Vegas, I consider 76 like a C+, B- version of them. Yes, there are currently no human NPCs, and the game is multiplayer, for all of the pros and cons that might have for you. But I'm still a sucker for that Fallout "feel," and unlike those other games, you truly do feel alone and isolated a lot of the time in this game. 
---
There is an overall "story" and plot, but the game is a lot less connected than the other three titles I mentioned. Like, you're kind of exploring why West Virginia has gotten so bad, and that contrasts from Boston, D.C. and Vegas, which still had various degrees of life to them. The game is in the $10 to $20 range on eBay and Amazon, so I'm not sure if that cost plus how much you'd have to pay for PS Plus makes it worth it for you. (They did have a free week when Nuclear Winter, the Fallout take on a battle royal came out, so they might be due for another one soon.)

So, a game comes out. That you can play from start to finish. You want extra stuff for that game. Extensions if you will.  Which requires other people's, time, effort, and revenue to make, and what? You expect them to do it for free? Lmao CTFU you are a special kind of spoiled.
---
Anybody who had the tiniest idea about how FO76 works would have understood that somebody would have to pay for the rental on the AWS server instances.
---
&gt; I didn't, not for one moment.
---
So you didn't have the tiniest clue, ok.
---
&gt; If you expected to pay, why do you like Bethesda
---
What kind of pervert "likes" a company?
---
I like the game.
---
While I wouldn't use vulgarities and offensive words, I still blame the player base.
---
The demand creates the business. 
---
What you're saying is don't blame consumers who buy ivory products, blame the elephant hunters because they are the ones who mercilessly hunt down elephants for their tusks.
---
Yeah how dare people hold developers to promises they make and higher standards.
---
Nope, I've been noticing a slew of low levels wandering around the vault and Flatwoods.
---
It must be true that  *All publicity is good publicity*
---
It hasn‚Äôt happened to me.  
---
As a precaution I‚Äôm keeping flux and screws in the regular stash, and putting the rest of the common junk in there, so far it has worked fine.  
---
 I‚Äôm wondering if the report is actually true or just disinformation.
---
I‚Äôll update should it happen to me.
---
what? A post from someone who still plays the game concerning the game?
---
Apparently Todd Howard had sex with someone's mamma, they weren't happy about it and every thing escalated from there.
---
Most of me wants to say "that's silly" because, well, it is.
---
But the 8 into 24 logic...is...strangely compelling.
---
Having said that, I doubt it because I doubt they could figure out how to make the "invisible" part work.  They'd mess it up somehow.  Certainly by now we'd have heard of it :)
---
you know what they'll notice? stop playing AND talking about their game. You wont be around to notice them noticing, but you won't care either because you'll be playing something else. no disrespect intended.
---
Ok I can give you that. It was primarily the scrap box you were comaining about.
---
Hey man, leave mom out of this. Thats just down right despicable.
---
You get shot for shit like that where I come from.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen once but it was a few months ago.
---
So no on the girlfriend thing.
---
More responsibilities? Lol what? It‚Äôs a game, not a job!
---
Just remember that its probably not the developers themselves its probably the publisher/investors that want to suck all they can out of Bethesda fans
---
You're right, I should know better than getting in the way of a good circle jerk. Carry on.
---
In one way or another, most people support an unscrupulous organization or industry. Have you ever purchased meat? Alcohol or tobacco? Used next day delivery on Amazon? If you want to make a stand again BGS, great. But it may be hypocritical to hold others to your own ideals.
---
You can pick up a hunting rifle skin in the vault tec starter bundle
---
That was the first thing I did after I started playing. "Oh, there's voice chat? Lemme turn that off."
---
Then why the hell are you still here?
---
You must be proud of yourself, paypig.
---
I cackle when I hear people claim that $13 is...outrageous, unbelievable, absurd, "the gall of," overpriced, etc.
---
LMFAO. Unless you're 14 years old with no income, then that's definitely not expensive for a monthly subscription... $9 if you buy a full year. 
---
This culling of the scrubs/whiners will probably make the game more enjoyable tbh.
---
I am not putting my personal life on the internet. You are a child lmao. Go to bed it is too late for you.
---
That actually made me chuckle :D
---
But TESO has way more players on a server and you don't get disconnected all the time.
---
I‚Äôve heard the gunplay ranges from mediocre to alright but my point was I‚Äôve never heard anyone praise (or even mention) Fallout gunplay. I played 3 and 4 and found it irritating at best. If you like it, more power to you, I just feel that in terms of comparison neither score very high.
---
It‚Äôs the complete opposite of 76, which is to say, fun.
---
Yes I was complaining  cause they said it was a visual glitch and it wasnt and I got ass blasted for pointing that out and then they admitted that it actually was deleting people's inventories
---
What they should of done is given us the tools to host ourselves or pay for server space. You dont just get free server hosting. Paying for server space is how it works.
---
He looks just like I expected. 
---
Full on neckbeard.
---
Mark David Chapman
---
Honestly I wouldn't buy it, but you get I enjoyed the heck out of the forward tent someone placed at the SBQ. Didn't have to do the overburdened walk of shame. To each their own.
---
Me too. I have spent $60.00 on this game. That's all they get from me. I wont play anymore.
---
And of course he‚Äôs a pudgy neckbeard. I doubt Todd is losing sleep over this guy.
---
I felt bored playing the unspeakable game in this subreddit compared to being hooked instantly into Fallout 76
---
Neither am I, but you'll get there. I found levels 20-35ish pretty challenging, and ended up getting alot of level ups thanks to sniping from afar, sneaking around everywhere, scavenging, cooking, building camps and such, but it got better. After 35 I could hold my own more and more in fights and events. After 50 I am running right up and shotgunning enemies heads off and joining scorch beast fights. Have fun!
---
&gt; Stop mocking, blaming, and insulting players who buy the subscription.
---
You obviously aren't paying attention.  The trolls aren't "mocking, blaming, and insulting players who buy the subscription", they're "mocking, blaming, and insulting " anybody who refuses to buy into their fake outrage.
---
Self hosting sounds good, the fact they didn't look at those options and just pushed out paid servers sucks for players, you make a fair point
---
It has already started,  The real "can you help me with this" posts are starting to return. 
---
The hatespew is dying down. 
---
Soon we will be back to normal. 
---
Though I expect it will continue over the weekend.
---
Which makes it even worse cause you don‚Äôt own anything. Bethesda does and when they decide it‚Äôs time to kill the game, your stuff goes to, so all the money spent was for nothing lmao
---
I don't understand this mentality. This sub is not representative of the playerbase. Like every subreddit, it's a small fraction of the community it's part of. 
---
As much as I dislike the practice the game is implementing, it works. Companies have figured out MTX make your game far more profitable without extra work. They know this grandstanding is hollow. Most will either buy it or stop playing, both cases being a win for Bethesda. Either they have your money already or you're going to give them more. 
---
I get the frustration, but this happens every month or so. Gaming company does unpopular thing. Gaming community gets outraged. Community talks tough about not supporting the company, burning disks, etc for karma while quietly buying what they were mad about anyway. Every. Single. Time.
---
Say it..  
---
..adult.
---
GREAT!!! Tons of stuff to do, a kind of shoot and loot aspect, legendary crazy weapons with potentially millions of different combos and modes, cool challenges the whole nine! The first 2 were excellent imo and played thru them both several times!
---
Dude idk how to explain to you what examples and comparisons are. Those are really basic things. If you are trying to start a conversation about which one is worse or which one you care about you missed the point of what I was saying.
---
You guys that defend Bethesda all type the same, it‚Äôs so weird. Maybe it‚Äôs the same person on alts lol
---
I feel the same way. 
---
I genuinely miss helping my little noobs with their first 1* pieces of equipment, silo quests and subsequently their first nuke.
---
Unlikely.  Companies generally want to increase their value as much as possible prior to IPO.
---
I think in this day and age people reach for the pitchfork first and worry about the why later. And if Bethesda does not want to add content they said they would then shame on them but at the end of the day they are a business. And all it takes is a single player elder scrolls and all is forgotten among their fans.
---
People giving in to business models like this are a part of the problem, it sounds very rough but thats just how it is. If they made no profit whatsoever and just negativity they won't do shit like that anymore.
---
The players buying this üí©are enabling Beth to abuse their player base, and they are justified in their anger. Think about how YOUR choices affect the rest of us.
---
People in private can own multiple workshops while farming materials with no disadvantage. Only groups or highly geared players can keep certain workshops for enough time to gather materials. Others are sniped and all junk that is not previously stored is lost (how convenient for 1st subs).
---
Damn, you're right. My 12 bucks are gone forever and now my life is ruined. Wait, nvm. I'm a functioning adult so I made those back in a few minutes.
---
I dont go to private servers.  I like the public domains. 
---
I wanted the junk box, camp, and emotes.
---
You can come see the dancing cowboy just south of Pleasant Valley where he has resided for 9 months, casually collecting acid.
---
we used to get expansions like they had in the Witcher. They were story elements that were within the world and made sense for a continuation of the character, but they were completely new and separate stories. Hell these are things that Fallout used to do as well. I expect people to be paid. But if you ask for money for a game that's so broken you should be paying me to test it for you and you then ask me to pay yearly 100 bucks for the privilege of updates that we should've gotten DAY 1!. That's an abusive relationship.
---
More importantly, devs do not get paid with profits, they earn a regular income. You are talking about executives and Todd howard types. The people that make all the ideas, the people that find out how to screw you out of your  money. Yeah i'd happily Demand free stuff so execs don't get bonuses while devs still get their minimum wage and have to do overtime crunch.
---
I still dont think the problem is Bethesda. Like JuiceHead, I think its coming from very high and that Bethesda, even the heads of it, dont have that much of a choice.
---
Well-said. Or not said.
---
Lmao goteeeeem
---
Edit: and wait, you‚Äôre not putting your personal life on the internet? Why? You‚Äôve just spilled your heart out over all the shitty online games you play, on what you do on Fallout, but won‚Äôt confirm the girlfriend. Sus, very sus
---
I personally found the official forums to be pretty darned toxic. Everybody ranging from the members to even some of the mods seemed highly childish.
---
I'm a solo player and just skip the co-op/pvp content. Never felt like I'm missing out. Sometimes it's been annoying when other people are clustering in areas I want to go, but now there's private servers for avoiding them altogether (not that I think it's necessary, people are mostly pretty cool/avoidant).
---
To those who wanna get the extra stuff all the power to ya.... The ranger outfit, I will be jealous with envy my fellow wastelander.
---
What you say is true there are a lot of people going off the rails... Guess what it's not pay to win or pay to play, the unlimited stash or 1600+ atoms per month will not get you a god tier weapon or armor so take a chill pill. I have no intentions of buying the service but fully intend to continue playing as I have for the last near year now... fallout 76 is still freaking awesome!!!!
---
When a 12yo doesn't know how a beard looks like.
---
Frankly I see no evidence that the trolls are even gamers.
---
I‚Äôm pretty happy, thanks!
---
Even Minecraft has a private server setting...
---
only a sith lord deals in absolutes. Bethesda ISN'T only listening to its sale numbers. It HAS to pay attention to such things if they want this game to continue. Apparently the players did too. But all the sudden no one wants to pay for paid servers. And now calling Bethesda out on the free game they still play.
---
I'm not defending, but just clarify that your statement is incorrect. I mean who wants to pay 22 bucks a month for a private server  just to play with 7 friends? Way too expensive.
---
I‚Äôm the mother flippin

Ok, neat.

---
"But I haven't played Fallout 76 in eight months."
---
Mr. Chapman, and anyone promoting this garbage, can kindly gtfa
---
No, the ranger outfit shouldn't be in the game at all. It breaks the lore completely. I could live with how the steered around the BoS being in Appalachia, somewhat. But releasing the ranger outfit is just outrages.
---
Definitely equipped good with salt.
---
Well if they released some actual good content then maybe they would get the positive response they need to get more budget.
---
Nah, I think Fallout players want some respect and not be blatantly lied to the face.
---
 *In their house at Maryland dead Bethesda wait dreaming.* 
---
Of your money and how to get it ;)
---
&gt; "Multiplayer" is a feature, and should never be a pre-requisite.
---
Play a lot of singleplayer LOL do you?
---
Other rappers diss me
---
Say my rhymes are sissy

This guy is a known shill, just check his post history.
---
I think he has an altar to Todd in his mom's basement.
---
You too? Thought I was the only one.
---
ive been using the ammo press to make ammo at the ammo facility workstation, and the lead nodes at the same workshop and at my campsite. Ive been doing this since, I dont know how long, days of total play time??? I've accumulated over 50k 5mm ammo. waiting till I get a good legendary minigun and then paint it chrome and just go crazy. furious minigun would be holy grail.
---
Same can be said about games like world of warcraft. People still pay for that. One day that too will end.
---
With Joe Mama
---
Neither do I... it‚Äôs a game
---
They need us to buy their game so we can tell them what's wrong with it so they can charge us to implement the fixes, they are either brilliant or fanboys are idiots reallllllllly
---
FO76 has a future?
---
Love the commie stuff. About time, after all that ugly America shit from 4th of July
---
I‚Äôm contractually obligated to inform you that spacer‚Äôs choice fallout first‚Äôs subscription is the best way to experience F076.
---
The only redeemable thing they could do is make it fallout 1st FREE. Anything else is corporate commander status.
---
Yea that‚Äôs stupid but that‚Äôs not on the same level as skins. EVERYONE wants skins for their weapons. And fallout has offered a lot of free, unique ones from NW to meat week! Not too mention the community goal challenges. You know how many people I saw wearing liberty prime or black bird, numerous times, that did the angry emote when they saw my ranger outfit, which is my favorite looking outfit from the series so they are flat out haters. They paid atoms for those expensive ass skins but I‚Äôm the fool!? Some had different 4 hoursmen skinsxwhich were pricey! I mean if I want a cool outfit for a game I play for 2-8 hours a day I don‚Äôt mind having paid for a free outfit!
---
&gt; If you are that upset with a change in the game, then stop playing. 
---
What?  The subscription is purely optional.  If I don't like the subscription I don't pay the subscription and just keep playing as before.  Nothing in the existing game has changed.
---
Wow, you‚Äôve totally convinced me! I hate Bethesda now, grrrrr!
---
ok sure you're a winner. clap. clap.              clap.

well yeah but the post doesn‚Äôt hurt.
---
And if you see someone say it once do you really need to say it 6 times?
---
Epic only get money if you buy on the Epic Game Store.  
---
Game Pass is Microsoft, who currently OWN Obsidian.  
---
Game Pass is the subscription with Windows 10 and Xbone that allows free access to many titles that are on those systems.  
---
If you spend money on the Windows Store, Epic wont see any of it.
---
Yea it‚Äôs fine. Ignore everyone. It‚Äôs got its issue but seriously what game doesn‚Äôt lately?
---
I hope they sell it in the atom shop. Not cause I want it, but because it would be so funny to see the 1st members reaction. And Beth‚Äôll do it too, they‚Äôve done nothing but spit in players faces
---
Obsidian have no need for those finances, they are owned by Microsoft now.
---
System?
---
They are not lying about you, what they're saying is true.
---
I don't think the scrapbox is the worst idea in the world, but the implementation was a little messy. Maybe they could introduce tiers of Fallout 1st memberships, a basic cheap one with maybe just double stash size and basic rewards, medium tier with a larger stash expansion and the ranger outfit, and finally the premium tier, the one they have now.  That way, players have choices related to their budgets. I feel players are alienated by the prices more than the idea of a premium membership.
---
I honestly don't see it that way. When the survival servers went down there was a marked increase in PvP players taking out their frustrations on players that no interest in that aspect of the game. Now it's even worse for those of us that did get the subs &amp; use the items we got. Don't get me wrong, PvP has its place in the game world that Fallout 76 exists in, I just don't like seeing high level players that want to play in that fashion being able to force the issue (i.e. triggering a players mutations to initiate PvP) or harrassing players that attempt to simply walk away. PvP isn't my thing, as I mentioned I like to hunt for the rare &amp; collectible items in the game. If I want PvP I'll go back into the Dark Zone in the Division or Division 2. So at times it's proven difficult to play the game the way I choose to play, not just solo but also with like minded people I've met in game. By paying for the sub we are providing funding for future development of the game. New items may appear 1st for us, but I'm sure will make their way to the "base" game at some point. Bethesda is by no means the only studio to do this. Yes, the game has issues, dome can be damn near game breaking. But if they aren't generating income just how would you propose that Bethesda pay for the future development costs to support &amp; expand the game? The subs aren't DLC and they aren't required to play, so no one has to buy them, or the atom shop items that doesn't want to. If you want what they offer then you spend the money, it's strictly your choice. Development costs for graphic designers, programmers, world builders, sound techs etc cost money. Servers to support the game cost money. If no money comes in &amp; the game is unprofitable then it will wind up just like Mass Effect Andromeda, or Anthem &amp; what we have now is all we will ever get.

Personal life and playing online video games are two very different subjects. Go cry to your mom so maybe she will suck my dick for you to afford fallout first for a month. Hell if she curles my toes I will get you a whole year. Is that a good deal little Jimmy?
---
Actually no Bethesda them self said you get to keep the atomic shop items &amp; points if at anytime you decide to cancel or end your subscription read the article please &amp; thank ya its more of a legal loophole kinda like how they are allowed to sell us pay to win items after promising it would all be cosmetic I believe some might call that false advertising 
---
‚ÄúMEMBERSHIP‚Äù - According to BGS
---
Fallout 1st will be available as a one-month membership, or you can purchase a yearly membership for a 36% discount (lol) over the monthly rate as shown on our website. If you cancel your membership or it expires, you‚Äôll still be able to access any Atoms received as well as the resources stored in your Scrapbox. Cancellation will be effective at the end of your then-current membership term.
---
(The Ranger Armor Outfit, player icons and emotes must be claimed from the Atomic Shop while your Fallout 1st membership is active. If you cancel your membership after claiming them, you will still have access to them.)
---
If they made the scrap box available to everyone this wouldn‚Äôt be as big of a deal
---
I agree with the only sensible comment in here. Yours. I totally get it too. Its a company. They have to make money in order to survive in this market.
---
I would definitely pay a reasonable subscription fee over microtransactions. Maybe its because I'm used to the charge on MMO's I played before. Like FFXIV, Ultima Online, etc. If they go that route and the development improves or is maintained instead of the game going away then they should do it.
---
I think we still get a say in how we access the game, however. I'm not sure where the line is between decisions that can be made on the customer side versus the company direction, but I'm pretty sure there is a variety of ways to handle how they upkeep the game.
---
I am also interested and on ps4 if you have any extra after selling to him.
---
Not really cause I dropped a sub as soon as I seen it coming and have already gotten some nice stuff. Never hurts to keep trying though.
---
Pro tip: it‚Äôs not meant for the general public. It‚Äôs for the handful of dumbass ‚Äúwhales‚Äù wasting their life playing this piece of shit.
---
They made the unholy mistake of being a business that wants to make money!!
---
Depends on what you like. 4 is great for citiy dwelling. 76 is great for country living. I just wish the timelines weren't so spread.
---
It's still happening to you?
---
There was a point in time that certain government functions were adopted by corporations. Academi (which was once Blackwater) is a good example of a scenario where governments hire private organizations to do the work of their own militaries.   
---
Paramilitaries in Columbia serve a similar purpose for the government.  
---
Funny thing is a lot of such situations where private militaries are involved, there are corporate interests nearby.   
---
Seemingly its always the corporations greasing the wheel. Makes sense when capitalism is " an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state."   
---
Seems like capitalism is working as it should,   
---
Where Bethesda and members of other industries set industry standard. To a point a company will know that their community will still purchase their product, outrage aside.   
---
They knew we wouldn't pay for facebook or youtube, so it is monetized through ads. They let us wait with the two options, then ask again if we will subscribe.  
---
The feeler in this instance may have been the fridge.
---
I have no idea why people buying this service sound so smug and sarcastic and condescending about it but I guess Bethesda knows their whales.
---
Just go to those announcement posts and just go, "Good for you!  You want a cookie?" because really no one cares
---
Well I was thinking about the lead extractors, steel extractors etc and you could just bulk and sell them for unlimited caps per say. Not to mention fusion cores! Farm those from the power plant and sell those suckers for 35-50 caps a piece and bank out! Not to mention the ammo production you could do after about 2 hours of farming west tek a couple times and lucky hole mine for lead ore. 2 ore equal 5 scrap! That‚Äôs nuts. I spent 15 in lucky hole mine and after smelting came out with 750 pieces! They sell for 3 caps ALL DAY if you aren‚Äôt looking to craft ammo that is.
---
people criticizing and thereby disagreeing with your opinion IS NOT HATE.
---

---
Haha nice fan fic. Your dad got a laugh out of it while I was fucking him
---
On Xbox sorry man. Im one of those people who lost their junk in the scrapbox trying to get some flux back
---
I mean, you still can from the correct studio. But the big guys are not the ones I'm talking about. 
---
Just gonna say calling people dumb over this is going to work against y'all. Already have seen a handful of posts saying they got the subscription just to spite these type of posts. You may not like it with sound reasoning, but throwing names around like a child is a great way to lose people's attention right quick. 
---
It's already spilled over to other games. FO76 is far from the first or last. But we can say these vitriolic posts are not having the desired effect. Nor can we say that there wasn't some evidence this was likely coming given Creation Club and dare I say horse armor. 
---
Your also *assuming* I have subscribed, and your wrong. The door is over there. Don't forget your hat.
---
It's the private world thing I can't get my head around. If you want to be alone why are you playing this game?
---
Well worth it for the price.
---
Buying Outer Worlds right now is literally telling Obsidian that you will still hand them money despite taking that horrendous exclusivity deal, this tells other developers that too. I know fully well Epic isn't literally getting that money, that isn't the point.
---
I love the 76 that was promised at E3.  The one with good gameplay, 16x the detail, and a good endgame like I envisioned after the conference.  I really thought those were realistic goals.
---
You don't know my dad or you would be at a clinic right now getting tested... just saying choose your own personal battles.
---
I think you're a classic hater who never played Fallout 76. I play and like FO76, but I'm not agree with this new suscription for servers with "benefits". I can play without pay this 100 bucks (BUT I'm not ignoring the problem).
---
I‚Äôm still not sure why anyone would buy the subscription unless they wanted a private server, which is a legitimate thing to charge money for.
---
Like all the DLC content and updates are free, so I don‚Äôt get why everyone is getting their panties in a bunch just as much as I don‚Äôt understand Bethesda‚Äôs actions
---
I just get golf outfits they sell for 25 caps i think server hop a couple times and you already reached the cap limit
---
Nah, we don't criticize you for eating Chik Fil A because you're subsidising homophobic shits, we criticise you for eating Chick Fil A because it's shit.
---
Stop trying to stir up trouble. If you want peoples opinions, go to one of the hate posts.
---
You need to google the definition of a "shill" and then grow up.
---
I mean, ima point out, nobody said you guys had to buy the sub. You can continue playing the game and exploring the wasteland without my new Vegas threads, my broken scrap box and my 1650 atoms that you can actually farm in game if you take the 20 minutes everyday to do the challenges. I mean you could.. you have for the past few years the games been out... just sayin
---
New Vegas : p
---
You can always play on a public server.
---
Twice what you have. You are pretty entitled to demand perfection, I‚Äôve enjoyed my experience in spite of the glitches, it‚Äôs that way with every game out there
---
Why? He got aids?
---
Going nowhere slowly.
---
Responders are borderline socialist-communists, so the idea of private servers does not Fit them well.
---
I'll pay for it once it's an actual AAA game.  I feel like this is just some indie game made with a free source engine from 2015 at this point.
---
No. You people giving them money for this are stupid and are the exact reason why business practices like this exist.
---
Worried? Get tested.
---
"vote with your wallet, if and only if you vote the same way as me".
---
the reason people defending bethesda get downvoted is the same reason you shouldn't give a platform to a flat earther. They have no ground to stand on. All their reasons are bogus. It's not a hate mob or a cringe fest. People are disagreeing with actual arguments and because there are too many people there is a lot of comments that come with that.
---
Luv it.
---
Wow, such a well thought out argument, now I‚Äôm sure to join you in your blind hatred of everything Bethesda! Let me just burn my pc for you to make sure the evil of 76 is exorcized from my home. üôÑ

How did asking the people who didn‚Äôt like the state of survival to gtfa work out?
---
The vault raids are super tough endgame content
---
But you go near to Vailt 94, and tune your radio to the broadcast station
---
Then use the terminal to open the door, then follow the instructions
---
I believe what‚Äôs happening is that the initial nuke kills everything in the radius. What normally happens is that fresh players arrive and the respawn of irradiated ghouls and creatures happens. If someone else joined, they would appear, though appreciate this may not be possible - but I also know that leaving your world doesn‚Äôt shut it down for at least five minutes after you leave so you can return and maybe force a respawn
---
Little warm-up for the computer.
---
Get over yourself?
---
yes no if you bought this your a fucking idiot who keeps enabling these game companies. your basically telling them yeah its fine to charge for gameplay features next time instead of paying for a bullshit subscription,lootbox, microtransaction.exc just light your money on fire or whipe yoor ass with it because its the same thing except your arent enabling these practices
---
This dude is a hero.
---
David Chapman, our hero.
---
If I had to guess, I'd say it's one of the following:
---
1. believe it not, as incredible as it might seem, it's actually making them money.
---
2. it's costing them a fortune but, for some reason, that's the objective.
---
3. they are morons.
---
I was being sarcastic - it was genuinely nice to see something that wasn‚Äôt about drama.
---
Well, I think you're both adorable!
---
Right, thanks
---
Ps4. Sorry
---
Yea but selling lead out of a player vendor, or even on reddit will land you thousands of caps everyday. So for little effort you get 675-750 scrap lead pieces at 3 a piece... almost 2,500 caps right there!
---
I don't' even really care. Luckily never bought 76 and happy to shout it loud so bethesda hears me. Yes i will call people dumb at some point, when they try  to defend something as stupid as bethesda making you pay through the roof for updates that you already paid for.
---
...with 8 people?
---
One tip is to uninstall the game and have more fun playing something else. You don't need subject yourself to a buggy cash grab just because it's a fallout title
---
How well does supporting a blatant troll usually work out?
---
People in this sub most likely bought the game. 
---
People who did buy the game are dumb for supporting Bethesda even when before launch, we knew this game would be shit. 
---
Talk with your wallets, or don‚Äôt talk at all.
---
Yeah fair enough
---
I‚Äôm devastated I‚Äôve lost everything
---
Sounds like someone who can't afford Outer Worlds.
---
Also you talked about Outer Worlds, enjoy your thread removal.
---
Outer Worlds.
---
Someones gotta pay for it to tell us what its like
---
How about this argument, these moves drive away players and that‚Äôs bad for the game. I want them to stop doing things that drive away players because I want this game to be thriving for years to come.
---
It might happen. Those who are willing to pay extra will decide the future of add-ons, DLC and other aspects. Unlimited junk storage space was a longer shot than shared stash, and look at us now.
---
/subscribed üòö
---
The player base pays for the game they want. There are a lot of idiots out there that are fooled and pay for trash. The major gaming company‚Äôs are targeting these people because it is easy money. As long as that player base exists and they keep paying for these ridiculous subscriptions, loot boxes, blue paint armor, etc... I don‚Äôt see it changing anytime soon.
---
NV for life
---
The wastelanders dlc will be $60. Pre-orders get loadouts. Remember you downvoted here when you buy it.
---
Trans girls are vulnerable oh no oh fuck üò≥
---
Bullshit, this community has always been full of salty angry people.  Filthy casuals is the community with the nice people.
---
Lore wise, I completely agree. Side note, I appreciate your earlier sarcasm.
---
Food fight? Must be an American thing
---
What does it mean though???? We must find the Wise Mothman to see if he has some insight!
---
In the future, it is tomorrow.
---
No, buying it right now shows that you're interested in the game.  
---
If you buy it on EGS it shows you don't care if a company sells out.  
---
But buying a game that's published by Microsoft, developed by a company Microsoft owns and put on Microsoft's store?  
---
That's perfectly fine, it says one thing, you're interested in the game and want to support it's devs.  
---
You've bought Fallout 76 on Bethesda's launcher, by your own logic that's supporting Bethesda's decision to lord over money more than being on Steam.
---
There is absolutely a valid argument that players purchasing this subscription *and other things like it* are damaging the gaming industry and hurting other consumers.  That's no excuse for harassment, though, and a lot of the people caught up in the outrage cycle probably don't even understand their own argument.
---
Local Boomer Shill happy to shell up extra money to bend over and accept Todd‚Äôs Rod
---
Yeah but they also nerfed an armor degradation perk (white knight was it?) right before releasing repair kits.  And they had increased the cost of repairs in the patch before that.  And both of these issues were already too high to begin with.  This is classic "Create a problem to sell a solution" shady monetization.  Not just gouging us for shit in the shop, but making the game worse to sell you a solution.
---
I wonder how much work it would take to essentially port the game assets (map, quests, creatures, items, systems, etc.) into a modified single player FO4 style version of their engine for purposes of selling it as a single player game?
---
Assuming it was possible, would people buy "Fallout 76 - Single Player edition?"
---
If it worked like FO3/FO4 (single player, no "always on", mods, etc.) I'd probably be willing to buy it.
---
Oof, I heard you can submit a ticket
---
I wonder if it'll stay this way.
---
Yes!  That chirp drives me bonkers
---
üòÜ, BGS deserves all the shaming they get.
---
Between bl3 and outer worlds I'm probably done until next year anyway.
---
It really depresses me that this is the cure-all excuse to ignore someone who you otherwise can't argue against.
---
Yea I kinda hate that about the private servers.
---
However we can definitely do this in public to have more people, do you have any raider buddies who‚Äôd be down to have a fun PvP event with the brotherhood?
---
Confused? Power armor worked then Bethesda ‚ÄúFixed it‚Äù which caused it to not work, so why would anyone pay for them to fix something they broke?  It be like taking your vehicle in for a recall and then having them say after the repair that now it doesn‚Äôt start but if you‚Äôd like it fixed you can purchase the recall repair fix for x$ amount.  You should thank us for bringing you the fix that fixes what we broke, your Welcome.
---
Probably better for you in the long run anyway.  Get out into the fresh air, etc.
---
I get it. Bethesda betrayed you but geez... if you hate the game and bethesda so much, just unsub from this sub and move the fuck on. Start a rally and march down to Bethesda HQ and demand Todd‚Äôs head on plate since you have a weird fascination with Todd. Does Trolling really make you feel good?
---
I'm just waiting for the apocalypse to happen. God is going to rock this world and tell everyone to stop bickering amongst themselves and to get along. 
---
Ahem. Aside from that. There is no reason not to voice your opinion, good or bad on here. Like the OP says, we don't have to personally target strangers on the internet. Its a truly childish practice when you disagree with someone. I guess if the childishness continues and you want it to, blame Trump for being the worst example of how to act. I'd soon as through the rest of the attackers in the same group as that guy.
---
The game I believe is still free on public servers, right? I thought it was just the private servers that had a rental fee.
---
Running around in their raider cosplay collecting stuffed animals.
---
No. Not a single second of it in my life, because, single player isn't an option. 
---
The entire fallout franchise until this point has been single player. That was why I bought the game. 
---
LoL has always been focused on multi-player. They don't have a base fandom that was expecting a single-player game like the rest of the franchise.
---
I have only 1 hour online after this subscription was released.  
---
For the same reasons like you.
---
And the only reason that I didn't uninstal the game already is due to helping new players or solo players (like me) with the scout quest.
---
Once the game goes on an amazing sale, I'm going to venture into 76 but I'm just holding out for it to be priced right.  I'm hoping there is an amazing sale during Black Friday.
---
I have about 20 of each flux except violet. Wanting certain fasnacht plans or mounted head plans. Price negotiable.
---
That not what I stated and you know it :D
---
Most games communities aren't ( like yourself ) stating "I will pay to have access to this extra " for everything and expect something better.
---
Re-read what I said if u want, it has nothing to do if other games have private servers or not :D In fact in most of gaming history private servers weren't an extra you purchase with microtransactions, this is a new thing YOU actively support and I don't, nothing more or less to it.
---
We can only pray.
---
*I see nothing wrong with them charging for a subscription or for utility items.*
---
 If your okay with this type of monetization for your game, and its not a big deal to you, then expect to be treated like a piece of cattle for the rest of your life, because that's all your are to Zenimax/Bethesda.
---
It's not the best choice, it's Spacer's Choice!
---
Well if SWTOR works on my pc you can have my shit. Angelthenatos PSN
---
What you "enjoy" won't be around much longer if this is Bethesda's new tactic, better keep giving them money for rent...
---
F76Filthycasuals begs to differ
---
The raiders I roll with are on PC. Sorry Mate.
---
Yeah, that's my experience too.
---
It's not even that I don't enjoy the game, it's just that I enjoyed it till I had done most of the content, and then put it down.  What am I gonna do, go kill all the same creatures I already have?  Do a repeatable quest again?
---
I don‚Äôt see this as a blatant troll, seems pretty clear that he did this to express his frustration at the way the game was developing and the pr speak.
---
So posting endless hate is supposed to encourage players to join?
---
One fucking person spent 150k on a shitty mobile transformers game
---
They don't give a shit, whales will pump money into the game and idiots will buy the next game they release.
---
Just like clockwork.
---
I would bet not just my balls but my dick too that come November they'll make more money off the subscription crap than everyone on this subreddit combined would have spent in the cashshop.
---
üòÇ that‚Äôs terrific.
---
Never bought the game. Bitching about the game. LMAO.
---
The next DLC is wastelanders, like Nuclear winter will be free. What you are bitching about is a subscription service. Not an addition to the plot of the game. Go away now troll.
---
Definitely against harassing people individually, but In general its ok to express opinions, realistically by buying fallout first you are agreeing with the practice and support it. Is that not correct?
---
I wonder if there's an adventurous community somewhere that would be into something like this. Take a break from collecting stuffed animals and actually role play a bit.
---
Skyrim VR? Only way to play Skyrim imo. Winter's coming, and it's the perfect complement
---
Exactly, what was OP smoking?
---
I'm debating it
---
I kinda wanna wait and see how much of a shitshow wastelanders is sure to be first hand, but I also don't want to download the 50+ gigs again on my slow ass internet if I uninstall... 
---
Whatever, it's the only thing on my spare SSD so if I really wanted to I could just format the drive, lol
---
(I upgraded from SATA to M.2 but left the SATA in there cuz why not)
---
You feel a bit fucked in the ass. Not because of the subscription, but because the game works better if you pay extra. No lag, silo runs with pristine performance, etc. Even shotguns do real damage.  
---
So, there's a better Fallout 76. But they didn't tell me that I was gonna have to pay extra for it when I bought it, a year ago.
---
Yea keep supporting and keep thinking about what you will decide... Bethesda already decided what they will do with you, take all your $$$ and laugh at you....
---
Ya keep supporting them good job
---
It will die down soon, dispute the anger, around 1/3 of people I run into are wearing the NCR Ranger outfit, I bet their others I run into who don't too. So the community is supporting 1st regardless. 
---
I think people are annoyed they locked private server behind a pay wall (which will mean mods down the road) and the scrap box as they just shown with that they could of given more stash space (that's the part that annoys me). But let be honest, people are buying, supporting the choice to go that way. Plus I wouldn't be surprised if some of the angry people brought 1st too xD
---
Right, right, apparently it's not "content" either because...?
---
Nah I dont argue with people over the internet I was debating you but I failed to read your other comments and it's clear your trolling.
---
Do trophies still register in private servers and how much does it cost?
---
That's all you are to any fucking company.  It's your own fault for thinking a company was your friend in the first place.  It's their job to make more money than they did before.  So unless you want to see games go for $200 a pop, let the whales buy the shit out mtx, and just enjoy the base game. Noone is forcing you to spend extra money on fo76, and dont give me you fomo shit.  If you feel the need to spend real life money on digital costumes because you feel like you'll "miss out" that's your own damn fault
---
in this world you are either a troll or a victim
---
What do you mean?
---
##What Someone Does With Their Money Isn‚Äôt Our Concern!
---
Seriously. While I refuse to buy a subscription service indefinitely because of my principals (A very small chance I‚Äôd buy if they make drastic changes and remove the benefits that give unfair advantages) people who actually want to enjoy this game can do as they please. If anything, if them buying the subscription miraculously somehow benefits the games content, then the game _may_ get better for those who actually care.
---
There is also the possibility that the people who you see running around in that Ranger outfit actually exploited the way the service works and cancelled their subscription after receiving their benefits for a month, without spending money once they got the rewards (At least I seen people say they done this).
---
I don't have to imagine, I am living in this beautiful reality and it's heavenly!
---
Enough for events, not enough to run into everywhere you go, I'd say pretty good sized
---
If they do, that means theyve been lying to people (surprise) for a year. But they most likely wont/cant because anytime you log a ticket for lost items their automated response is something like "do to technical limitations, lost items cannot restored"
---
Plus ATOMs at an incredibly reasonable rate (if you've been averaging a purchase every month or so), infinite scrap, cosmetics, emotes. These would not have been included had the private server been worth the monthly rate on it's own. At this point, it's a further developing neat bonus. That's fine with me. All MMOs are driven by the promise of what's next.
---
Okay. Sorry you think that? Could you still give me that link to the quote you mentioned above? Feel free to ignore me after that, but I'm genuinely interested in getting hard statements on this matter whether they support my opinion or not. 
---
Go for it now, before BGS locks more features behind a paywall.
---
How about no Scott
---
1 hour, 14 posts.
---
I didn't look to see if 14 people actually unistalled.
---
Bethesda is shitting their ranger suit pants right now.
---
Seems not worth it??
---
Spend your hard earned money on something else.
---
Bethesda doesn't respect you.
---
They will fk you over again
---
They did straight up tell us this wasn't a single player game, though. If you bought 76 thinking it was, then that's on you.
---
You know, I know that Fo76 is a hot mess but I would like to point out that the brand new studio with no experience with that bad, old engine that doesn't do multiplayer did, kind of, sort of, actually get it to work.  Sometimes.
---
I'm still impressed :)
---
Just like everyone you plays or has played any computer or console game since DOS, or any game ever, they achieve one thing and that is entertainment and something to take our minds off the real world, which if you hadn't noticed is not all Nyan Cats, Unicorns, puppies and kittens.
---
Don't think to deny people a release from the trials of the real world, that seems to be becoming more unstable by the year and many of us have a little expendable income that we can use for fun. Price of a coffee and sandwich a month to enjoy something they like.
---
I didn‚Äôt make an argument.
---
That's true but it's far worse than that.   They are making you pay money for unlimited junk storage, something that really should have been in the base game since day one.  "We can do that because server stability," they told us. 
---
Now they are telling us "Sure, we can do that but it will cost ya."
---
Get ready to be attacked from every entitled, gen z gamer on reddit.  I for one,  completely agree with you.  The only reason we still pay $60 for these games, is because of monetization.  I personally dont spend a lick on mtx in games, but I'll gladly let other people do it.  That way, I can feel assured that my gaming hobby will continue to only cost $60/game
---
Extra stuff Is better (playable) performance? I do not think so. Game performance Is not cosmetic.
---
I felt sorry for you, drooling on yourself. I wanted to help.
---
Right? lol
---
&gt;Now point on the doll where the bad Bethesda touched you.
---
I sorry but that one had me in stitches.
---
The thing about *Reducto ad absurdam* is it often reveals the absurdity of the person using it.
---
Why isn't this content?
---
TTW was my favorite game to play. I started as the courier and assassinated the lone wanderer and impersonated him
---
Worth noting you can pay the BBB for better ratings, they're basically an extortion racket
---
The fact they haven't paid to change it though, that's fascinating, lmao
---
A guy. 
---
Who hadn't played the game in 8 months. 
---
Needed to "express his frustration".
---
About a game.
---
He hadn't played..
---
In 8 months...
---
The guy is the very definition, of a troll.
---
&gt; Never bought the game. Bitching about the game. LMAO.
---
Not complaining about the game, complaining about the payment system that came from other games and is going to be worse in the next iteration of games. If people don't complain, you are going to eventually sign your life away to play a game. The base game already costs more than 60 bucks, by pawning off parts and calling it DLC. now they want you to pay 60 bucks up front then the game is unplayable in the first few months, then they want you to pay 100 bucks a year to have a decent experience with mechanics of a free to play game.
---
Seriously if this gets more traction, this will be part of the next elder scrolls, the next fifa, the next cod, the next need for speed. Hell the next mario title. It's gonna get worse, unless we fight for our right to receive a decent product for our money. I am still shouting, because i want this to be worth the money I might pay eventually if it becomes good, but as it's looking fallout 4 might be my final purchase from bethesda.
---
FO76 is now, has always been and likely always will be a burning train wreck.
---
But yeah, private servers were always going to cost money and $8.33 a month isn't really a bad price, especially considering that it does come with in -game currency and other perks (that they promised they'd never sell/charge for).
---
Incorrect. The stability issues lies in the weapons and items that can be modded. Too many of an item with different codes can crash a server. Like 12 pistols with 12 different mods. But a lot of the same items with the same codes (i.e. metal, wood, ect.) Can be managed much more easily. Having 1000 steel in your stash under the same code across the sever wont crash it. But having 100 rifles in the same stash with different mods, this different codes, will. 
---
And before you argue with me (which you will) if you know nothing bout coding, go research it 1st.
---
I am not the one that gave you the lamp but I have to go through nuclear fallout every week now. Damnit I like this game but Bethesda's is a real demon. I hate it, I like this game but that stupid company keeps destroying it. From the start, I had to pay 80 CAD to play fallout 76 expensive at first. Adding  to that there was also the atomic shop (which should have never fuking existed ) and now this idoitic system where you have to repay the game every fuking year? Fuck no, I like this game but this is the worst decision by far.
---
Go get your own gear.
---
Poor College Student too poor to afford subscription, too toxic to parents to ask for money!
---
I mean if you pay for Fallout First you're essentially asking Bethesda to keep doing this to you. Sure you're free to do it, but you're not exactly encouraging good behavior from them.
---
The real life version of this would be like people buying sneakers.  The sneakers come with white laces.  All of a sudden, people find out that you can buy different colored laces, and some people are pissed that the sneakers didn't come with the option to buy the shoes with different laces on release...  see how stupid you all look?
---
I don't see what the big deal is, if you want a private server and the perks buy it. If not just keep playing, like we all have been.
---
She bought it because she's too lazy to mute people she finds annoying. But no one made her actually use the unlimited junk stash. So yes. I hope she lost her stuff.
---
I don‚Äôt carry cash on me though.
---
Lol yeah and unlimited junk is ok because the 7 people a server limit. Lol it's a trip how people are so upset they don't really think about it.
---
nah, I'll be taking all those legacies down with me. same with dozens other players who have quit in the past for one reason or another.
---
it's not hard to find a reason to ditch this game, really. Fo1st is just the cherry on top.
---
boomer
---
I came across 2 in close proximity the other day.   I thought the game had glitched when I kept hearing that even after picking up the 1st one.  Plus, I swear, I sometimes hear them when there's no reason to - almost like the sound is being carried on the wind from elsewhere.   Maddening.
---
Players:  Fix the bugs Bethesda!
---
Bethesda: OK.
---
Players: Hey!  Don't take it down, I was playing!
---
As in optional local hosting for people with servers they can use
---
I think Fallout 1st players should get a big golden Vault Boy statue wearing that bellhop shit to put in their camp. It can be the object players interact with to get your suggested XP buff.
---
That or they can get special markers or frames that indicate their VIP status.
---
...not because we should hunt them down with Harpoon guns while shouting YARRRRRGH or THAR SHE BLOWS or anything. Definitely not that.
---
I hit white springs, had several legendaries. I did the cabins and went to the clubhouse, had 3 3*, 2 2* and I forget how many 1 stars. Of course the could have luck box rng.
---
I do know there is a spot by my camp that I'd always hit up on my daily grind.  Sometimes a legendary sheepsquatch (1*) would appear.  Maybe like 10% if the time.  Well.... The 2 times I've ran to that place, I've had a 3* gulper appear.  I've never even see a 3* gulper in game before.   Again, could be luckbox rng.
---
You mean the posts you chose to read on a third party website?
---
Lol clearly I can't reddit, as you can see.
---
I like your idea for a cheaper sub price, but maybe implement tiers, base, medium, and premium with increasing rewards and perks. And as to not leave the rest of the playerbase out, login rewards and another stash expansion.
---
complaining about predatory business practices isn't entitlement. unless you're ok with mobile games milking you for your every last penny.
---
because that's the direction we're heading here.
---
Ranger armor (as long as there is no NCR insignia) is actually Lore friendly. It‚Äôs a prewar armor that you can find in the divide on long dead soldiers in the lonesome road dlc in new vegas. It just goes under the name riot armor instead.
---
Edit: actually the person isn‚Äôt prewar he is NCR but the armor is pre war. From the 11th armored cavalry unit
---
Except this is a game that STILL has serious issues. It's pretty much impossible to separate the issues from the devs.
---
But what do containers contain?
---
Contents.  Plural.  Actually worse than a single content.
---
the big deal is that your telling them its fine to charge $60, release a broken and buggy game, and then charge you $100 a year or $13 a month oh and have that to be broken on launch
---
Give them $100. That sadly seems to be the thing right now.
---
With enough steel, you can build anything
---
You probably should have taken the few seconds to look lol
---
I lost 5 glass, 2 wood, 1 steel.
---
I'm fine with that.
---
No new engaging content will. How has that gone over the past year? When a large chunk of their player base says we don‚Äôt like this hopefully it will encourage them to take a new approach that leads to new engaging content.
---
&gt; The entire fallout franchise until this point has been single player. That was why I bought the *[ multi-player ]* game. 
---
Reading difficulties, eh?
---
I‚Äôm 28 and I‚Äôm a writer for a gaming website lol.
---
I get this stuff for free. But yeah, go ahead and shame poor people I guess.
---
I guess it‚Äôs avenger money anyway. Spend away!
---
The rest of the sane world has written off 76 for a long time now. If you bought Fallout 1st, I have no sympathy for you. Stop enabling Bethesda.
---
Thank you for your thoughts... and sarcasm - ? "sweety".  I guess that's a small part of our problems.
---
My post was an attempted call to objectivity.  I do remember "the age of actual video games".  All the way from "Pong", Atari, PET, Vic-20, C-64, Apple IIE, IBM, C-128 ... ... and through all of the dawn of PC games (when I still had time to play them all).  And they were not bug-free and there was no support and there was no feedback and little communication with game companies.  The stories were not that great (by today's standards).
---
But, these games were indeed glorious for us - at our expectations.
---
I am not trying to say that FO76 is Perfect and that it can't be better.  However, it is not as bad as many posts and youtube videos make it seem.  I can't believe that anyone today would spend hundreds of hours on a "bad" game - not with all of the alternatives out there.  
---
Be objectives - about the bad and about the good things.
---
You forget a small but highly relevant thing.
---
Premeditation, which makes this fraud. And worse, it's online. Which in turn means it's now wire fraud, which inturn is a federal offence.
---
Lol what are you even talking about? Who pissed in your cereal this morning
---
Are the 76 servers empty?
---
Can't, need to read all the complaint topics.
---
Not enough time.
---
Basically, I would be very surprised if what you are describing came to pass, and I would most likely start playing the game again.
---
Now that is just rude.  People being upset about shitty business behavior is one thing.   Bashing other people because how they spend their money is another thing.  The toxic behavior in this sub is insane.  Just be civil and treat other players with some respect.
---
Not gonna happen unfortunately, its human nature. Unless the two sides form a physical group and go to war with each other and wipe out/conquer and convert the other it's never gonna stop
---
Perhaps he liked the game but found limited reason to keep playing because of the lack of content. And he‚Äôs frustrated because instead of releasing content they released pay walls and pay to win.
---
Its not the end of the world though. All that shit is easily replaceable since you‚Äôre able to collect as much as you want.
---
The Outer Worlds is Cracked
---
Oh ok, if you're on ps4 I'll be glad to receive you with open arms ü§ó
---
Why brownfist not bandwagonfist?
---
it's not like the game has gotten any significantly better in the last 8 months to justify getting back to it.
---
which is exactly the problem. they released a broken mess and after one whole year it's barely functional still. yet they dare to charge even more for it.
---
yeah, no. they deserve to be mocked for it at the very least.
---
PC here, but I appreciate the offer anyway :)
---
Yeah, cos the outer worlds is yunno... Good?
---
Because your take is oh so unique
---
I should be more clear in that I stuck with the game because I enjoyed it. I stuck with the company because I enjoyed their games. For every mistake they made I didn't support those. I just enjoy the game and tried to not hate on it so much.
---
I will hate on stupid money grabbing choices the company makes, just as I always have.
---
Pretty sure it's a skin. You have to have a backpack in your inventory already.
---
If Bethesda does crossplay we all will have fun :)

Ok.  Let me try this again with some context.  I'm only comparing this to Fallout 3, NV, and 4 (I haven't played the older games so I can't say whether they fit or not).  This is the template that I consider "Fallout" currently.  There is a world here that is NOT the same as any of the games mentioned.  A world that I enjoy.  That is what I consider "pure Fallout".  You can have similar RPG elements, camp building, enemy killing, etc. in a ton of other games... but those games will never BE Fallout.  It's not about game mechanics, it's about the environment, the story, the Nuka Cola.  In it's current state, I'm sure most of them are better games, go play them if that's what you want.  As long as this game isn't forcing me to pay more than it's original cost &amp; PS+, I'll keep enjoying it in spite of everything they've done wrong thus far (and likely will continue to do).  In addition, I am looking forward to playing The Outer Worlds, likely in Dec once the hype has died down and bugs are patched (and I have more free time).
---
I've played the outer worlds for around 10 hours now and I haven't seen any bugs
---
Well, you will have to pay for a subscription and upload your mod to the server, see if it works, iterate it, reupload it, see if it still works, etc.
---
Without a local copy it's going to have be uploaded for every single iteration.
---
No big deal if your mod is 4Kb or 3Mb or some such.  Try that with a 700Mb texture pack and tell me you won't decline the experience ;)
---
Pretty sure you have to unlock the backpack through the scout quest line first.
---
Not to be funny but what‚Äôs the point in posting this
---
They gave you a subscription for free without you asking for it? Must be a really big gaming website like Kotaku or something. One thing I've wondered, do you guys make a lot of alt accounts on reddit to better influence your posts?
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter whether I agree or disagree... I honestly don‚Äôt care, and neither should anyone else... it‚Äôs an opinion. 
---
My main post is about the blatant hate being shown overall that‚Äôs flooding the feed. 
---
Many in their own words uninstalled the game or don‚Äôt even play... so they give an opinion on a game they don‚Äôt play or now have? 
---
Bet you bank they didn‚Äôt delete their characters! 
---
Many accounts are also new and joined to bash... 
---
If people want to contribute or make it better great but 200+ posts turn into whining in a big way in a forum that supports the game. 
---
Go create a hate fallout group... you have the right to that... 
---
I‚Äôm going to play fallout now with a few friends on a private server now... 
---
Enjoy your day!
---
I totally agree while I personally don‚Äôt agree with spending that amount of money on such a small amount of content for a broken game at the end of the day it‚Äôs their money and they can do what they want and I‚Äôm not gonna judge, after all I bought dlc for ark.
---
sounds like private is perfect for you then, since you don't have a group or a lot of gear. not sure why you are mad about it then?
---
You need to do the challenge, get the badges, get the standard backpack and THEN, you can mod it.
---
I've a cardboard box at home. if you'd like to store it in there you can for $100/year.
---
You have to understand the hate for the game itself and why it‚Äôs justified, before you can understand why asking for another $100 is ludicrous
---
Whoop de doo good for you nice to hear you flew I don't give a poo.
---
Also they already fucked up Elder Scrolls with ESO. If you like Skyrim, never play ESO
---
Huh- I didn't realize it would be possible to miss the sarcasm there. My bad.
---
it's a standalone backpack, except you need the plans all the same. and it doesn't work with the small one, you need the plan from the scouts questline.
---
Actually no all im doing is getting a refund for a product that sucks thats not illegal it is however a side effect that I just so happen to be able keep the outfit a minor piece of the content I will no longer receive for canceling my service it was not predetermined I just found it out from being UNSATISFIED with my purchase &amp; am warning other players who feel the same way im not a crook unlike the devs that tricked us into buying theyre game on false promises like all cosmetic micro transactions &amp; all free content just so they could get our 60 dollars and spring the trap on us a year later
---
Its gonna be like this for at least a week.
---
The very reason why 76 turn out this way was because people still give them money REGARDLESS of quality, they are the root of the problem, this is just the symptoms
---
The game could be offline and bam. Private server. Zero cost.
---
Could you please rewrite that in English or French.
---
I dont see a problem with a subscription in this game. If you wanna argue about some of its aspects fine, but you clearly did no research about this going into it. Just read about all the hate and went "I HAZ OPINIONZ." So I'm just gonna step away from this and let you argue with yourself. 
---
Whole lot of circle jerkin goin round
---
Why would you read the same thing being repeated over and over after you already watched it on youtube?
---
supporting anticonsumerism hurts us all, even indirectly so. I can't help but laugh if you get instant karma'd.
---
at the same time, it's p2w, so after a few hours you could have it all back and then some.
---
Cool, thanks
---
Don't hate the players it's not like they were forced to buy it. It was their choice to pay the subscription. Imo buying one month is good because you get 1000+ atoms and other items for 19$
---
I expect nothing for free. I‚Äôm happy to pay for games, pay for subscriptions to premium services etc.‚Äîbut there is an ethical line, and utility items cross it. 
---
No consumer would accept any other business deliberately building problems into their product just so they can sell you a solution. That‚Äôs exactly what these developers are doing when they sell utility items. It‚Äôs unethical, plain and simple. 
---
Not making enough money from cosmetics? Create some better cosmetics. Too many people using free Atoms to buy them? Reduce the amount you give away. Not enough of a player base to capitalize on cosmetics? Make a better game so more people want to play it. There are a lot of ways to make money that are consumer friendly. 
---
As for words having no effect? That‚Äôs nonsense. Look at the new COD. They said flat out that they‚Äôre not putting loot boxes in. That‚Äôs not because they just suddenly decided to be nice. It‚Äôs because people have been bitching about how terrible they are for years. Words don‚Äôt always have an immediate effect, but if companies have to face this kind of backlash every time they make these awful decisions, they‚Äôll eventually learn not to.
---
Interesting variables here... You all seem happy about the idea but don't trust enough just for... well... Maybe a bad idea, who knows.
---
Thanks for the answers.
---
Yup jealously makes people nasty ... idk .. so childish ..
---
You don't think the game has improved at all since February? Come on, I know I see your ID in here and unmentionable other 76 subs, you really think it's "barely functional"?
---
Get a job commie
---
Or really if you wanted to take it up a notch. Craft an absinthe ridiculous amount of 5.56 because a lot of people on trading subs won‚Äôt sell for caps but will count 5.56 an equal currency as 1:1 currency. They know they can always do same when they are looking to buy something.
---
Perfection? I just don‚Äôt want to see bugs every 5 minutes. I also don‚Äôt want to get disconnected 3 times per every 5 hours of playing the game. I don‚Äôt know what games you are playing but this is a standard in every game except those made by Bethesda.
---
Depends on the house and the vehicles I suppose.
---
1500 square feet and three Honda civics?  Not so much.
---
15000 square feet and a Rolls, Bently, Bugatti combo, well... ;)
---
I'm not shaming poor people, I'm a poor 28 yr old myself. But I'm not so poor I can't afford things I want, it's how we deal with the dredge of life. However when I can't afford something, I don't complain about it
---
Only 62 more days 'til Christmas, that's what it means.
---
I understand that you are upset about Bethesda's "shitty" business practices, but now you're just being an ass.
---
*wear* $100 sunglasses
---
I paid 80 EUR, got over 800 hours so far, 10 cents an hour seems ok to me.
---
Hohoho...
---
It‚Äôs prob $20 new... $16 at Walmart just checked.
---
So far, no.   
---
No nasty bugs in my playthrough yet.   
---
Which is NOT something I could ever say about any session of Fallout 76
---
I read them while I'm killing 3 star legendaries on my personal server, like right before I see what they dropped, I read 1 quick. It seems to be bringing me good luck so far.
---
I had to write an opinion piece on it.
---
We‚Äôre not that big but we‚Äôre in the top 10.
---
This is my only account but I can‚Äôt really speak for other writers or websites.
---
same as all the other circlejerking posts. except this one is a different circejerk.
---
honestly there's no difference between all the "I quit" posts and the "this community is great", "guys, I just had the BEST idea" and "to the guy who..." ones.
---
It has a while ago:  https://skyrim-together.com/play/
---
How about a Nintendo 76 for Christmas this year?!
---
Just laugh and report them, they will probably get a coms ban
---
That's why they want the comparisons to 76 to stop.
---
I don‚Äôt think the industry trends toward subscribe to win mechanics, my friend. But it‚Äôs cool to be negative, I get it.
---
Have some points just for the screen name
---
Then don't give it a shot. Listen to your instinct.
---
Yup. Uninstalled.
---
I want what Fallout has always been. Offline, single-player, story-driven adventure.
---
edit: Also, how heavily over-moderated is this sub? I have 96K comment karma over almost 9 years, and it's restricting my replies to like every 7 minutes?
---
juesus  thinking there is a future for this game is wildly optimistic in itself.
---
I'm like an hour in and I'm not even slightly disappointed so far.
---
No üòê
---
call me an asshole if you want idc someone  has to say it , people continuing  to give money to this disappointment of a one's great company are at fault here
---
You‚Äôre right.
---
Yeah, it has nothing to do with Fallout 76. Outer Worlds is an actual, fully functional, single player game.
---
Nah, most of the arseholes are here and have never played the game.
---
So how is your life worse due to the issues you cited?  I'm not trying to pick a fight, I'm seeking to understand.
---
i dont think theres anything wrong with them charging either. i do however feel like you should have the kinks worked out before you launch a "premium" subscription service. other than the atoms there is currently nothing of value in the subscription, server performance, you would think should improve when playing alone but it doesnt. my personal issues isnt with the cost, or even the desire to monetize, my problem comes from an obvious lack of quality control. i want the game to be good, and am willing to pay, but currently the game is only getting more costly, with no further increase in value.
---
I understand it tho. Every game is doing it now, and they need an income source for the servers. I was hoping the atom store would be enough for them.
---
I'm more mad about the industry as a whole going this direction.
---
Did you complete order of tadpole?
---
Buddy, literally everyone has been "saying it" since the update dropped, you didnt say anything new...
---
It sounds perfect, but a little bit forced for the conveniences I stated. Don't you think?
---
I have no problem with the private server's cost. I have problem with the whole package.
---
And to be fair, I would have bought the package for the Atoms and NCR skin, but it gives advantages and lead the game on a path, I've seen many MMOs went already.
---
To be fair I haven't... I stopped playing for a good bit of time and just started again.
---
Truth comes out.  The sudden influx of bitching is not from actual players of the game but Gamer Justice Warriors trying to fight EA.
---
Zero weight is convenient, but it doesn't taste as a game.
---
The negative circlejerk of only shitposting about TOW isn't any better than the ridiculous shilling in the opposite direction
---
Thank you, hes a good boy
---
Don't think so, think they just gutted your servers for space my guy
---
You seem angry. Why?
---
I would be genuinely interested to know of other examples where a game developer chose not to make money where such potential existed.  Please share this information.
---
I'd still say that those are the exceptions and there are not many of them.  From my experience - it could be Project Red - and they are the exceptional exception.
---
No DO blame players if they pay for the subscription simply because that means they are directly, actively and willingy supporting a dumb policy. 
---
They can do it, they just have to deal with it that people can criticize you for it. Thats only right.
---
My tent works just fine, and i Haven't lost any scrap, so I'm good.
---
But my private server did crash a couple hours after playing and couldn't reload into my private server for an hour, so I did what any other sensible consumer would do.  I filed a ticket and hope they investigate the issue and resolve it.  If it happens again I do the same.  NOW if it keeps happening over the next couple months I'll do what any sensible consumer would do.  End my subscription and do something else.  Maybe play Guild Wars 2 again.  Now there is a bug free game!  (Heh... Not really)
---
It's fine if buying the sub makes you happy.  I agree with my brother who said "This should have been free, local, and offline"
---
Please go head and uninstall r/FO76 while you're at it.
---
So people who dont play cant have an opinion?  Ok
---
Honestly, this is probably the dying breath of FO76. the diehard players will pay for the subscription which will keep cashflow coming in for Bethesda as the game slowly dies off. it provides a revenue stream maybe long enough to get them through until starfield releases. Doom will obviously help as well but this is Bethesda's way to squeeze the last bit out of the towel before calling it quits on FO76.
---
You don't understand the situation. You think your purchase of cosmetic MTX (especially inflated ones) are unrelated to P2W. You're wrong, and now you're enduring the yield of your actions.
---
lol astroturfers exposed!
---
Warned me of what? I know the company keeps making stupid mistakes. I still play the game and enjoy it. I just dont spend another dime on it.
---
No, I don't think I will. I like making fanboys like you mad..
---
As a non 76 player, I think its unfair for you to take such a strong stance on a game you've never played. People who bought it that I know are relatively happy, apart from the scrapbox thing, but they support their favorite game company because they want to see improvement. If you want to see something fixed, you don't abandon it completely, you take time and invest in the product to see the project through. If everyone thought like you, nothing would ever get done.
---
it only gives advantages for some people tho, for me playing on a private server would actually hurt my income, since i sell stuff a lot to other players in my vending machines.
---
This business practice isnt new. Dont blame bethesda for it. Ill continue to spend my money on whatever i like.
---
So you join a group dedicated to Fallout 76 that you don‚Äôt play and insult people... 
---
Trash... pure trash and why you won‚Äôt get anywhere... hope the admins ban and block you.
---
They are offering you something new you can choose to buy or not. Who cares?
---
Ohhh believe me I regret everything I have ever done for fallout 76 or bethesda. I'd sooner burn $60 than give it to them.
---
I am, but I'm more mad about the industry as a whole pushing for this. I was hoping the atom store would be enough
---
But you knew what you were buying.  You KNEW the track record of a fallout game.  Bugthesda was dubbed long before 76.  
---
And the game does work, you can still play without the sub and nothing was taken from you since you bought the game, in fact they increased your storage and are still offering wastelanders as free content.
---
They acquired Obsidian in November of last year and the game was announced the month after. They were likely in negotiations with Epic before that. The game was made using Epic's engine (Unreal) after all.
---
Classic character assassination posts going on in here.
---
The Gamer Justice Warriors are out in force today.  As for the people who actually play the game: #NotYourShield
---
Oh, definitely not. 
---
Honestly, I thought this was the dumb, profanity laced, site/image that kept being reposted. I was mistaken, his site actually isn't that bad.
---
Or you dont care either way and just want the stuff
---
Thank you for your comments.
---
I frequently hear about the "false advertisement".  Could you share a link to the misrepresentations that were made.
---
I haven‚Äôt really seen people complaining they can‚Äôt afford it, seems like a popular strawman argument.
---
People saying they don‚Äôt want to pay for what they consider basic features of the game they paid for, or people saying they shouldn‚Äôt have to because Bethesda stated they weren‚Äôt going to do things like this.
---
yea I haven't seen a single post here that actually blames the customers instead of Bethesda, sure  Bethesda is at fault, but people continuing to play after release and buy micro-transactions are the actual problem, people buying  the "premium" pass are just the cherry on top
---
Damn it, man/woman! How do you expect people to react to this completely and totally reasonable comment and perspective?
---
I wonder when the sale started. *Hmmm ...*
---
Exactly... comes here and trashes the game but also players...
---
Downvoted for the truth I see.
---
I guess the "do this to you" and "good behavior" subjective and so some just enjoy it either way
---
I'm buying
---
#The Outer World
---
game looks amazing, downloading this minute, can't wait to play a new take on the genre.
---
Not even close
---
Plans and policies change when it comes to budget review.  The executives that told blatant lies should be held accountable, but as a consumer, I knew they were lying the moment I read about their statements.
---
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
You did spend a 100 dollars on top of a 80 dollar cash grab of a game. I think people are allowed to criticize you for that, and especially for supporting this. Threats are over the line, but criticism is a normal thing we receive everyday.
---
Oh no! Deadmeat08! I didn‚Äôt know you were going to leave! What will we tell WhoCares37 and UnnecessaryRedditing22?
---
Fallout 76 is being mishandled far worse than Anthem.
---
K.
---
I'm a "fanboy", you're a...
---
It's on the tip of my tongue...
---
Starts with a "T" I think...
---
Nope, they are on maintenance
---
Awww :( please not that
---
What does mtx mean?
---
Thanks for letting me know , ne soit pas une petite pute
---
Hey man, I've been giving BS the benefit of the doubt since fallout 4 and everything since then has been nothing but a downhill race, I spent 200 bucks on a broken piece of shit, so yeah I'm butthurt for being an idiot and thinking they could do anything right and making myself look like a clown for giving them my last shread of hope, and you know what, if they pumped out another fallout game, I would buy it again day 1, because this is my favorite fandom and I really can't back out of it, even though I really should
---
I have a brain for not supporting a greedy company, yes.
---
Games seen a recent influx of players this week.
---
I was mistaken. I thought it was the edited image/site that kept being reposted in here. This guys site isn't so bad, kind of amusing.
---
Ageist
---
Sorry friend, but it appears you have a reductionist perspective on this. Maybe you aren‚Äôt familiar with the nuances of game development. Games have been priced at $60 since the late 80s, but production costs and development times have only increased mutlifold. Not to mention live games require server maintenance and ongoing content updates, game balancing, etc. My ‚Äúinflated‚Äù comment was a bit tongue in cheek, but the reality remains that live games require some sort of monetization to endure, and I‚Äôd rather support a game through cosmetics than other options.
---
I bought it and I love the game. One of the reasons that I pay to support it.
---
I kinda wish Obsidian could sue Bethesda for custody like a concerned parent sues for custody of a child.
---
I purchased it, but I think a tiered system would be a fairer option. 
---
Another option could be for a lesser tier that is free, but you earn it by atom challenges in game. You don't lose the atoms when you earn enough to access the system, but it will be an extra incentive to grind those daily's &amp; werkly's for those that want to.
---
 I'm still not wasting the atoms that came with it  though on the overpriced crap they mostly bring  out. Maybe the subscriptions will lead to lower atom shop prices, one can only hope. I'd be happy for them to reduce my monthly included atoms if they did that.
---
A friend bought it and was on for all of ten minutes and found ENTIRE FUCKING CAMPS that were not only fully intractable but damageable.
---
He isn't sure if it was a phantom "NPC" instance like this one guy on Dark Souls who got absolutely wrecked by a phantom player after his internet shut down and the game took the reigns of what was once an actual player..
---
Which in this instance is scary, do you lose those bought items? is your base unfixable? I mean imagine sitting there and an entire wall is suddenly destroyed.
---
No worries, just pointing it out.
---
IMO it's by far the best Bethesda-like RPG to come out since Skyrim.
---
They aren't as bad as EA or Blizzard in my eyes but they got awfully close awfully fast. It's sad the whole industry got like this.
---
I mean, sure, but that's really not how PR works as a profession. You dont stay because you like or dislike the company, and the message you do put out to the public is decided by the company/marketing, not you. I'm sure plenty of PR guys working for hated companies like Blizzard disagree with the statements or think the direction of the game/company is stupid without actually having any power to say anything
---
Precisely.
---
I don't go to COD subs or WOW subs and trash their game and WOW's monthly membership "as a non player" because I don't have a valid opinion since I don't play the game. Thats just being a troll.
---
People say that this sub and other places for fans to discuss does nothing but this sub has over 6k active users. Which is nearly half the amount of FO76 players on steam while I write this comment (slightly over 14k).
---
There‚Äôs probably more people subbed to this sub than that play the game in one day.
---
It's not capitalism. It's malpractice. Unethical business practice.
---
If you buy a NEW car and they offer warranty and repair for the rest of the cars life, but immediately the engine is playing up. You take it multiple times to be fixed but they say, nah sorry we can do anything. Then after a year they say, but hey if you want to pay for our premium service to fix that thing we said was unfixable. That's malpractice.
---
Fallout 76 was a "new" game with many problems that should never have been a part of it, some of which the community heavily requested to see if there was a fix (eg. storage was completely unacceptable). Bethesda said "nooooo, sorry it's impossible. Too much strain on servers".
---
Now there's a fix, that puts less strain on servers, and helps the customer, but they choose to put a price tag on it.
---
That's charging for quality of life changes that should've been implemented from day 1. But people had to wait a year, and now they have to pay.
---
That isn't capitalism.
---
uhhh what??? what kind of logic is that?   
---
that make it worse since they willingly give money to Bethesda  even when it doesn't give a shit about them.  
---
And the fact that anyone would try to justify this Subscription is laughable
---
If you use the atom shop to spruce up shop you get value with atoms received.
---
If you hate fo76, you prolly shouldn't waste your time with it.  There's a million other subs you can join bro. Move on and be happy
---
Perhaps there's not a post, but I've definitely seen a lot of people talking about it in the comments of the 15,000 different angery posts lately. 
---
Plus, why is this so important to you? What people do with their money isn't your concern. lol
---
I'm standing infront of the man himself right now! He's afk but oh my god his shops are just full of legendaries!
---
In my universe, Firefly is starting its 16th season.
---
Yeah you're right, there are a lot of strawmen being set out for Halloween. Same level of strawmanning as assuming OP is a Boomer. But how did your website cover ESO way back when? Puff piece? What about when they introduced $100 mansions and $50 characters that let you access a bank from anywhere? $20/30 game upgrade to play as an Imperial? Or did outrage not get clicks back then?
---
would be cool if you got a reward for raiding but not taking from other players
---
Stop whining about video games.  If you don't like it a game don't buy it.  Better yet put down the controller and find a girlfriend.
---
Vampire's plasma thrower (got it back when plasma rifles were bugged to only spawn as 1* lol) - damage bug
---
Quad automatic tesla rifle - damage bug
---
Junkie's faster fire rate tesla rifle - damage bug
---
Instigating fat man - Firing multiple nukes quickly just makes them disappear
---
Instigating explosive harpoon gun - +250DR while reloading, so the instigating part of it gets broken after reloads
---
Alien blaster - more of it is broken than working properly. I spent time getting a fully modded level 50 one and learning all the mod plans, just to find out it deals garbage damage, has bugged delayed invisible projectiles, and can't ever be legendary. One of my favorite weapons since fallout 1 and it's a broken joke
---
Syringer - I like the idea of tactical support play, but the damage barrels all suck. The endangerol one gives enemies free armor penetration against you, not the other way around. And all the other interesting ones from fo4 were removed
---
Bottlecap mines - pretty self explanatory tbh. They were fun while they lasted. First they stealth removed all the world spawns, then they stealth removed all of them from player inventories. Meanwhile laser muskets, dev room PA paints, duped god tiers, and all other cheated items are still perfectly ok. Such a fun weapon to mess around with
---
I haven't played in a while, but apparently there are still issues with spin up weapons like the gatling plasma? I have a ton of those, shame if they are STILL not fixed
---
There's probably more but this is all I can remember off the top of my head
---
All good
---
I am guessing the social menu is still bugged then, ill try and send you another one, try and send me one and between them maybe one will get thru.
---
RogueAOV
---
For the millionth fucking time...  they did not "nerf" White Knight, they balanced what was an over powered perk to begin with and the increase in material cost bumped a single repair from needing one ballistic fiber to needing two... big fucking whoop.  
---
Know how many ballistic fibers I have sitting in my storage?  Well over three hundred, and that's after I just junked a bunch to make room.  That's not e en mentioning the fact that NO ONE BUYS THE FUCKING REPAIR KITS TO BEGIN WITH.  I have over 150 improved repair kits sitting in my stash and I don't even show up for SBQ fights that often to get them.
---
This isn't a capitalism thing, this is a power thing. Money is power. More money means more corruption. Power exists in a capitalism, socialism, facist, and communism. Power may not take the form of money, but power will allows exist.
---
I'm not happy about it. I just expected it because it's how the whole video game industry works. I was just hoping the atom shop would hold out but I guess not.
---
How stupid are you to judge people on a title of a reddit post? Seek help.
---
It is really unfortunate and a strange choice for skins to not work in the small back pack also.
---
No, you are the reason they are doing shit like this. Because you  pay to get shit. As long as people pay to get shit, they will give shit. If you want quality, stop paying for SHIT. 
---
They do this because DUMB people buy it with their parents money, and it makes them money.
---
Yeah, the free "tier" in my suggestion is the login rewards. Login for a certain number of days in a row or days per month and you can get cap rewards, atom point rewards, rare outfits, or even weapons. Add the extra 200 unit stash size increase and you please most everyone.
---
Iv had a blast running through every area collecting scrap! Sorry your that you are unhappy about it
---
It's actually nice to consider all my 100k+ cap items are just sitting in a shame box somewhere in the aether, along with my max cap characters, waiting for a log-in that will never again happen. I played for free via gamesharing the entire time and never spent a dime on atoms. It pains me to see things go the way they have, but at least it was a cheap date. Ironically enough, all my friends and I have gone back to nitrado servers on Ark, which are *actually* dedicated and private. And customizable. And cheaper. And stable. And can host more than 8 people. And don't crush dreams and kick babies.
---
Yes sir. I'll just enjoy my game quietly and not post about it anymore
---
Cool, go with that then, here‚Äôs my retort, I‚Äôm gonna keep playing, cause I like the game, I‚Äôm not gonna be influenced by shit posters who hate just to hat and probably don‚Äôt play this game anyway.
---
is there anything they can take?
---
Hi, thanks for doing an AMA.  How does it feel to waste your money? What would you have purchased had it not been this?  What do you suggest everyone else do with their money?  Thanks for taking the time to answer, you are a wonderful human.
---
Of course.
---
thank u!
---
Why did you post in the first place?
---
If you use the atom shop it has value.  What's hard to comprehend?
---
1) You didn‚Äôt have to pay anything for the game. You chose to. Choices typically have a cost associated with them. 
---
2) If you don‚Äôt like the Atomic Shop, don‚Äôt buy anything from it. None of the items are required. 
---
3) You don‚Äôt have to pay for the subscription service. You can still play the exact same game you bought months ago in the exact same way.
---
Yes...apathy from players when a company makes clearly shitty business calls is exactly what I was describing. I get it, you don't care, you don't think it affects you. I'm here to tell you, you should care and it does affect you. 
---
This argument that "Who cares you don't HAVE to buy it." is so fucking old and played out. That's not the god damn point. The company continues to lie and break promises. It has nothing to do with "letting a hobby make me lose my shit."
---
I said significantly. no, I do not think it's improved significantly since February. or October for that matter.
---
and when terminals take 10 seconds to load between options and the game is *still* eating my items I have a hard time calling it functional.
---
*plot twist*
---
Play The Outer Worlds instead. Problem solved.
---
It is by definition downloadable content.
---
&gt;Yes sir. I'll just enjoy my game quietly and not post about it anymore
---
You liking the game isn't the issue...my goodness, I swear this stuff goes over people's head, smh. So you think that it's fine for developers to release shit like this? They're going to keep doing it because people like you are perfectly fine with broken stuff...smh.
---
I love the game, that's why I paid for endless scrap cause i know I'll be grabbing A LOT of it
---
Yeah I know I just don't like the idea of having to pay for content even more after you bought an already expensive product
---
Not as many as you'd think, that was when legendary stuff was really broken I was a flying mutant able to 1 shot a max level death law 2 star
---
Yup. Though breathin in half-burnt castor and nitromethane fumes probably cancels that out. Heh.
---
But you don‚Äôt have to. You have the option to do so but it‚Äôs in no way a requirement.
---
Although there is alot of negativity I wanna stay positive, I optimistic but being real, there are no big games coming out soon and tbf Fallout 76 has alot of time to improve...
---
Another thing is to all that are like minded I've made a new channel supporting the Fallout 76 community with a new video. Check it out:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD8Xg2\_Qs5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DD8Xg2_Qs5w)
---
I hope you all don't. Maybe this will make you think hard about your next purchase. Good riddance.
---
Queen and Raids can be soloednwith right gear and build.  Not by me, but people do it.
---
Right.... You realize that thanks to capitalism the human quality of life has increased drastically, many of its early problems have either worked themselves out or were solved by our system if self government (like child labor, corporate script, 60+ hour work week, employee mortality and so on) and that every country that has tried alternatives to capitalism like socialism, communism and national socialism have been dramatic failures that oversaw/see the most gruesome crimes against humanity?
---
Well, they're kind of right. You are a cuck for supporting their practices despite them repeatedly screwing over players since it first launched.
---
Bashing perks make little difference. Not worth the points. A 15 strength character with full bashing perks should kill low level ghouls, creatures and some scorched too.
---
"why is this so important to you?"
---
Believe it or not I want Bethesda to succeed and to make good games like they use to , I loved them, But buying in to their scams will only hurt them more 
---
"What people do with their money isn't your concern" 
---
Is not.. until it affects me.. and people continuing to give them money regardless of it's quality affects everyone, supporting inti-consumer practices hurts everyone
---
I saw him as well, if also seen some other advertising eyebots scattered around
---
As long as they offered it gratis for people who did buy 76 the MMO I'd be perfectly happy with that as a resolution.
---
Horizion Zero Dawn was a great game as was Spider-Man, They both had excellent stories.
---
Should I share a disrespectful, confrontational opinion about your dog even though I have never met Apollo?
---
Fair disclosure, I have nothing against your dog.  Looks like a happy pup!  But your post on the Fallout subscription was junk.  
---
I encourage you to try the game before trashing it and its players.  Until then, the game‚Äôs bugs and one-shotting, griefing, event-perching asshats are MY bugs and one-shotting, griefing event-perching asshats.
---
Before the patch, it didn't happen to me. But it happened to my girlfriend. She thinks it's because of like others are saying where they forced the game to close while it was loading into a server.
---
But after the maintenance all my stuff is still there.
---
Exactly... hope admins remove him!
---
I saw him too but no quest started when I interacted with it.
---
I guess it's not active yet.
---
MicroTransaXtion
---
Speaking as a mildly curious observer, I wouldn't exactly call this place a beacon of positivity. It's more like fans of a sports team that isn't doing very well.
---
Speaking as someone who used to buy Bethesda titles no questions asked (Until 76 because not interested), I am still gape-mouthed over their fall from grace. I don't think I have ever seen one so quick and complete.
---
Fair enough
---
Micro transactions
---
If Bethesda wasn't filled with con artists.
---
Gaming world : Derps and Kids under 25 not understanding why Non-Derps and people over 25 are pissed.
---
They call this type of behavior addiction.
---
Ah. Thank you. 
---
I‚Äôve seen it a lot over the last couple days but couldn‚Äôt figure it out lol
---
I agree that it is down to personal opinion, but the fact that there are certain advantages for paying consumers is not good.
---
Thanks. Couldn‚Äôt figure it out lol
---
I wonder if he knows that they released an actually blue skin, as opposed to the vault tec one. Although to be fair, the atom shop prices now are *a bit* better than on launch. We had to pay 1800 for vault tec, blackbird, etc. Nowadays most PA paints are 800-1400, 1800 gets you something like liberty prime
---
It wont work, the eso sub doesn't share
---
No, you shouldn't be getting personal insults, but you also have to understand that in terms of making a difference, focusing anger on Bethesda does nothing.
---
As you say Bethesda won't respond to the complainers. Do you know what they do respond to? Money. That's the whole reason they're selling out their fan base like this. And when you buy into it, you're giving them a vote of "It's okay, you're doing nothing wrong, keep doing what you're doing Bethesda."
---
So naturally, the only way to hit them where it hurts is their wallet. So we have a company making horrible predatory business choices, selling out their fan base, and outright lying. They won't listen to criticism. So when people see YOU ACTIVELY SUPPORTING THEM, yeah you're the person they feel they can get mad at. Because maybe you'll actually listen to reason. Because Bethesda is doing this regardless, consumers have the choice to say no.
---
You decided to say yes, and in doing so supported their behavior. Whether you think you did or not.
---
How many of those people come over from other subs to gawk at the shit show and make snarky comments, without ever playing the game?
---
Preety sure it shows 2 pics on the atom shop
---
I just watched Chibi play it its looks pretty damn good single player too which is a bonus imo
---
When they disabled the leaderboards in Survival the actual leaderboards were still there. They didn't read anything but they were there. They just disabled a flag or variable.
---
I'm sure when they killed the servers some employee said "Hey Boss! We gotta remove this setting that indicates survival mode is still a thing!" And the Boss said " Nah nobody will notice. We need to make new skins for the chainsaw and pipe rifle."
---
Circle-jerk os putting it lightly. This sub has become an angry mob aggressively grabbing at each other dicks for upvotes. I really wish the mods would just ban pointless posts, i appreciate the constructive criticism comig from here but a post that just "Bethesda sucks. That is all" and it gets 2k upvotes isnt helping anyone or anything. I like that the devs actually check into this sub but if it gets flooded with shit posts there isnt going to be any point in devs coming here for constructive criticism. Id honeslty like to know if the people making those posts and upvoting them even play 76
---
You do this in every post? Reported for spam.
---
Honest question. Do you think that the additions to this game over the past year have attracted new players? And do you think that this game has been successful at retaining players? If the answer is no the end the game you like playing won‚Äôt be around forever.
---
Rofl. Yeah, no.
---
Yeah they did! They've never been the sentimental type anyway. It's great to see him happy.
---
Congrats on you guys making a year! You seem happy
---
They respawn if you rejoin private server?
---
Angry joe's video on it showed the same gameplay footage (from admiral bahroo or something) that was out on launch, showing some fucked up textures. Most of the other footage was from their review back in like December 2018. I think a bit of new stuff was shown, but not much
---
But...all they're doing is reporting on what's actually happening. None of it is fake news. 
---
There's been no misinformation about this. It is as bad as it sounds.
---
People need to blame them, not Todd. Unfortunately, the poor guy is the public face that most people know, so he's catching all the hate.
---
No it hasn't, you are confusing this sub with the other one.
---
&gt;why would the servers be packed if everyone should be enjoying their ‚Äúprivate‚Äù server?
---
What you'd know, if you actually played the game, is that you can who from your friends list is in a public or private world. The majority of people that I know got FO1st are not being hermits on their own servers, they're still joining public worlds for the bulk of their time online and only hit up the private worlds for trades or to solo something particular.
---
Or are just people coming back to continue to laugh at it now that it's back in the news cycle. Occam's Razor homie. This game has been a tale of epic trolling by Bethesda.
---
Stop and think kid. What does it matter what i spend my money on. Its my money, not yours. Move on man, unsub and be happy. There are plenty of subs where you can tell people their idiots for spending their money. 
---
Look for them and due your duty to society
---
Fo76 is fine and dandy. I find enjoyment in it so thats why im here. I get my fallout fix with this game and it's a first for multiplayer fallout.
---
Lol I‚Äôm not a minimum wage worker, but I know the value of money
---
Maybe this is a good lesson for Reddit "fans"? If I were Bethesda I would have realized a looong time ago there was no pleasing this sub. Maybe save your pitchforks for legit issues next time instead flying off the handle about every tiny business move (which is all optional in the end).
---
They wernt lied to.  Bethesda stated this was going to happen, before it happened.  The company policy changed.  They let us know.  The game changed, they let us know. 
---
They explained why even. And those of us who understand capitalism and market trends understand that unless you are a 501c3 you make products to make money.
---
They had to do this, or there would be no more support.
---
Calling OP a boomer because they‚Äôre complaining like one isn‚Äôt a Strawman.
---
A Strawman is ‚Äúan intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.‚Äù So in other words, making up an argument that no one actually made, like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just too poor to afford it and thats why you‚Äôre mad!‚Äù
---
I think ESO is a much different title than FO76. When it came out it was kind of underwhelming and disappointing imho, but after years of work and dedication to improving the game, its actually worth playing and has a lot of content. You can usually pick it up for around $10 and theres no mandatory sub, it has ESO plus which imo is a way better deal than Fallout 1st. You get access to every DLC, small QoL buffs, a lot of in-game currency, and a ton of stuff in general. The huge Manors and stuff aren‚Äôt really for me but for what they are I think players get their money‚Äôs worth. Housing also isn‚Äôt completely paywalled or anything, you can get most of them without paying for anything, its just an alternative.
---
I just don‚Äôt see much value in Fallout 1st. ‚ÄúPlay by yourself or with 7 friends‚Äù seems silly for an MMO. NCR Ranger outfit is highly sought after but for $3 less you can get the Xbox Games Pass which comes with Fallout New Vegas and The Outer Worlds. Unlimited scrap would be nice and its similar to what ESO plus has, but it didn‚Äôt even come out working and deleted people‚Äôs scrap.
---
I think people were kind of pissed about the Imperial thing if I remember, but that was years ago. And theres three other human races, one of which isn‚Äôt that distinct from Imperials anyways so it never seemed like a big deal to me.
---
Well, there you go. the Trump family is ruining something else.
---
Good job guys.
---
76 was started 11 years ago, so thats probly why. It originally started as an idea to make a co-op mode for fallout 4
---
this! lost around 50 vault steel and amongst fluxes and tons of junk this hurts the most.
---
Ah, yes, the old "if you're not with us, you're against us" adage.
---
It's treason, then.
---
You sound like an abusive boyfriend who knows what's right for everyone else. I mean believe it or not Bethesda's is a business and if they want to continue they have to make money one way or another, how do you want them to do that. Private servers costing money makes sense they are literally running a server for you. I'll allow the argument for you to run your own servers using your PC as a server for your friends but the main issue is then hackers just tear the game apart in a month. I dont mind spending 8 dollars a month on something that I get more the .33 of enjoyment out of a day.
---
It's not requirement but the game looks more simple and not as pretty behind those things. Oh and by the way what do you do when you have all the plans
---
Atomic shop üëÄ that's riiight. Dude don't defend Bethesda with the atomic shop or paid subscriptions it's just going to make games more and more greedy that you will only have about 70% of what the game has to offer in the future. I am not saying you have to pay but it should be free content considering the price of the game. Same as private servers
---
Yes, in order for junk to respawn you need to pick up a certain number of other junk items and reload into a fresh server
---
Lmao, sure. Notlike boycotting everything would make a difference.
---
Surprisingly every company just wants to make money, and I'm sure they could care less about you wanting them to be good again. Nothing you do or say, will change that. It's all about that green stuff
---
You really shouldn't be this invested in how Bethesda acts. 
---
Plus, no matter how loud you "protest" ultimately nothing you say will matter, people will buy what ever they please. So like I said, whatever people spend their money on shouldn't be a concern of yours
---
no, they respawn once you pick up enough stuff to cause it to respawn.  Or wait till the next day.
---
It has nothing to do with what server you are on.
---
Anyone still playing this long after release clearly has an obsession with Fallout/Bethesda. They knew the game was poisoned after the disastrous release. They recognise no new players are coming, so they're gonna do their best to milk the absolute desperados that remain - because if you stuck through everything else, why wouldn't you pay up?
---
Whoa there bud, Beetle Adventure Racing was perfect. And of course it had bugs, it's Beetle Racing.
---
This isn't fallout. It is an easy game. They've gone so far as to let you pay for your own safe place to collect stuffed animals and join the scouts.
---
What about it? 
---
Sorry your comment is a little vague.
---
I feel the same way.  A full price purchase plus Xbox live really makes the state of the game a huge deterant for a sub service.  I just want the promised features to not be behind a pay wall. 
---
I probably will not be back, I'm coasting on other titles till cyberpunk comes out
---
Bread crumbs. I always wanted a game like this, so every once in a while when they fixed something that affected me, it was a step in the right direction. I was able to for the most part make my own fun with what was given and still enjoyed it hundreds of hours in. Then they started breaking more things than they fixed, and eventually it just stopped being fun
---
Andromeda screwed up in the intro when you don't save your dad by sharing your air with him. Bad writing killed that game in the first 5min.
---
The type of monetisation and the game that they have built influencing it, I am not a fan of. I'm glad you enjoy yourself but Bethesda had enough good will before 76 to put out a F2P online/offline 76 with all their money coming from cool cosmetics . With the game cleaned up on initial distribution it would have been very successful. Fortnite, successful. I think it's a step in the wrong direction for how companies use their titles. 
---
I see the devs at Bethesda enjoy making fun maps with cool lore. It would be more successful just creating a proper game and drop all the scum (That comes with the umbrella they are under).   
---
Scum  will lose them money and it's sad to watch Bethesda be like this.
---
Judging by the community back lash you should probably put your three braincells together and determine that people didn't get a $60 game. They payed $60 for a shitty alpha version that never went anywhere. Try again, bootlicker, this ain't the place to brag about liking your Bethesda brand cucking¬Æ
---
Sucks to be you, that‚Äôs not been my experience. Want buggy? Try getting and staying on a gta5 server
---
The comparison I've started to favor is robocall scams.  Those things are just awful--the value of my phone has dropped significantly because of 'em.  And they're so obnoxious!  Even though 99.99% of the population is too smart for 'em, it takes almost no time and effort for companies to operate these scams...so that .01% makes it all worthwhile.  So long as that .01% keeps falling for the scam, I'm going to keep getting calls about my auto insurance when I don't own a car.  And so long as the scam proves (immensely) profitable, we're going to endure more and more copycats.
---
Robocall dupes are largely the elderly and mentally ill.  Many gamer dupes don't have that excuse, so I've far less sympathy.
---
Being a bad consumer (Yes that's a thing) is different than comprehending the concept of subjective entertainment.  I wouldn't personally attack you because you bought the FO76 subscription, but you need to understand that this behavior reinforces bad practises from companies. And if you had some insight about a company's profits from MTXs and/or subscriptions, you'd understand why it's a terrible practice. 
---
And i'm saying these things because i've worked in game development and i know how profits are distributed within the company. With a subscription like this, you're not paying the devs, trust me on this.
---
I would honestly come back to the game and community. I follow certain channels that are insanely harsh towards Bethesda right now, but I'm almost certain that they hope to be proven wrong about the game.
---
It's not $100/month, it's $100/year, which is $8.33/month
---
I only joined Reddit, and this sub, because my constant searches for Fallout 76 related help consistently brought me here. I suspect I‚Äôm not alone in that. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to experience the game to the full without community help and shared wisdom.
---
Sorry that not everyone is a mindless drone like you. Sweaties should stick to mobile games instead of shitting up every other game.
---
It is by definition downloadable content and 76 isn't fallout.
---
I do (or did) play the game. Never seemed like a lot of people were playing. Always saw the same usernames. And why would your friends burn money on private servers and then play adventure anyway? Seems like a dumb waste
---
Hahahaha üòÇ
---
That better not happen dude it's bad enough now I'm gonna end up quitting the game at this rate but I don't want to as I've met amazing people, such a goddamn shame
---
I love Bethesda because they make good games
---
It‚Äôs a penalty for being antisocial
---
This game is a scam. You people are idiots for buying it. Bethesda probably agrees with me. You'll be all like "boo hoo bethesda bad" but next release people are frothing at the mouth to throw good money after bad just to play the same buggy shit you've been playing since the dawn of time. 
---
How many copies of Skyrim have you bought?
---
I dont believe I wasted my money 1 bit. If anyone supposedly "wasted" their money buying the subscription then they also "wasted" their money buying the game as a whole. I wouldn't have purchased anything else, had a spare $13 so figured why not. I suggest everyone do whatever they damn well please and not be a stuck up jackass about what people like
---
BGS - Bad Game Studios
---
[https://i.imgur.com/94gFhvR.png](https://i.imgur.com/94gFhvR.png) **Play solo** or join together
---
[https://i.imgur.com/88ZF3uC.png](https://i.imgur.com/88ZF3uC.png) There's also no mention of requiring an internet connection. But go ahead, uplug yourself and see if you can even get into the game to "play solo."
---
Loading times do feel significant better, at least to me. And I've never experienced that second thing, not even on public servers
---
Wow. How about blizzard and China, ea and battlefront, ea and buoware, ea and addictive mtx for the sports games, riot and its sexual assault.  I think you need some perspective on where Bethesdas exists in the state of the gaming industry.
---
My favorite part is that the private worlds are actually recycled servers that players already played on, so you are getting the world alone and that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs not a new server.
---
Hey, Bethesda, go fuck yourselves! :D
---
So what's your rebuttal to my argument?  That is, that the only reason we still have games at a price point of $60, is because of mtx.  Game companies are forced to split up the game, and sell it as piece meal because they know the gaming market will crash to the ground if they raised the price point to $150 or more, (where it probably should be if game costs rose with everything else due to inflation)  we are getting a choice.  We can buy the base game at $60, and be perfectly happy with it.  Or, we can choose to spend extra money and get additional content (which for 99% of mtx, is completely optional and not necessary to enjoy the game).  Its not like they are selling big fixes to us.  Nothing in the atom store, or in fo1st, in necessary or required
---
I did the same.
---
Super excited about the pirate costume!
---
Is it not ok if we just like the game and are ok with spending our money on it?
---
Well you lasted a lot longer than the majority.
---
Thanks! Fits well I thought :)
---
It's on sale right now.
---
I only bought a month just to see what it's like, it's not bad but tbh its bullshit at the same time 
---
Scrap Box and Tent should be 100% FREE and you pay the sub for the Private Worlds, monthly atom boosts and the outfit with more coming in a month if that makes sense
---
Thing is though I'm not mad, I am but I'm mainly disappointed they could've had a major, major game on the market and they fucked it up
---
I bought it 10 odd days ago. I'm a huge FO fan I just wanted to wait as long as I could because of all the hate it got. I hoped it would have been fixed. 
---
At this point (lvl13) I feel I already got my $20 worth of fun and I'm still wondering around V76. I haven't spent any money other than the initial purchase and I don't feel it's holding me back. I care little for cosmetics so I haven't spent my 700 odd atoms. 
---
The only real gripe I have is you can't spam the "X button" to get the game started. Nope that tricky dick takes you to the Atom store. On occasion the server crashes (maybe 3 times so far) and I loose progress, but I'm use to that. FO4 shits on me from time to time and I play survival so I'm use to losing progress that way. Not that is totally acceptable but over the years with Bethesda games, it is what is. 
---
I only wish I could get someone to actually talk to me because I have so many questions. I have had some non-verbal co-op that was crazy fun. I still can't figure out how to accept a team invite (PS4) so I have missed a few opportunities to enjoy that. However I have read a lot of horror stories about teaming up with random people. So far no one has annoyed me or caused any issues. I love that I can find a location someone just cleared and left nothing for me. Makes the world seem more believable. In FO4 I'm always asking myself how has no one been here in 200 years why is this stuff here? So over all I'm enjoying the experience for what I paid and im looking forward to finding a friend to play with in the future as all my real friends are on Xbox and I now play on PS4.
---
This isn't a fan subreddit. That's contradictory by nature to an extent. This sub is exclusively for the most dedicated players - people who are willing to not only play the game casually, but find a community where they can discuss it and look for more advanced play styles and maybe even help in testing some obscure elements of the game. Being dedicated does not necessarily mean being a fan, and plenty of fans play the game too casually to bother ever coming here. That's why it's important to remember that anything you see here is not always representative of the main game playerbase. You will probably find more fans than non-fans here, as even the most dedicated people will eventually get fed up and just leave if more shit keeps getting thrown their way, but you will find plenty of people who still play the game and even enjoy it but are very critical of it
---
Is Todd sitting there approving these ideas like it's a good thing? I wonder if the board is ripping him a new asshole these days.
---
They‚Äôre definitely using it for sympathy cause they couldn‚Äôt handle the internet
---
Doesn‚Äôt it add up to like 20 something cents a day?
---
If you buy the full year. If it is bought month-to-month it is $13/month
---
not too long ago it was a land of happy posts, people discussing meeting loved ones and sharing tales of joy and community, finding themselves and their passions and then the bombs fell and everything changed... but greed.... greed never changes.
---
yea that would be nice except the servers are not actually private lmao!
---
As a FO76 hater now, I still say it is worth 20 bucks of gameplay if you are brand new (although it may be even cheaper soon if you are still price concious). The world does feel more empty and unnecessary annoyances but there is a decent chunk of land to explore and loot and new enemies to tangle with. If you meet the right people you can even have a truly different and wonderful experience, but that honestly was abck when the game was still new and "hey lets head towards that giant thing in the distance and figure out what it is" was still a possibility.
---
If you want a good MMO or fallout rpg experience, particularly solo, I would say you can skip it. It had a lot of warts and I do not think it has gotten much better. There are better but more expensive games out there which I think are better for those experiences.
---
The FBI: ‚Äúok‚Äù
---
&gt;...not actually indicative of the playerbase as a whole...
---
Sure but your argument is semantics.  Saying that reddit isn't 100% representative of the playerbase, while a true statement, doesn't mean that it isn't a relatively good, if not the single best statistical sampling of the audience.   It's not relevant that it isn't 100% representative if its *mostly* representative.  Do you have a better representation or sampling that you're hiding in your back pocket and haven't shared with the rest of us?  Because random anecdotes  isn't even remotely representative of a group, in any kind of topic.
---
There's going to be players who are either extremely dedicated to the fallout series (some people *only* play one game or series) or simply have a very very low bar (i.e. less invested/less experience, maybe they only play games for 3 hours a week or have only played a handful of games in their life, resulting in them having less to compare to and lower standards).  So while these players do exist, **they** aren't representative of the playerbase as a whole.  Reddit, on the other hand, **is** the best statistical sampling we have, that's also a large enough sampling to get actual legitimate data from.
---
They aren't requiring a pay subscription to just continue to play the game, are they?
---
At least you got to play, I was installing it and it bricked my ps4. Had to reinstall os, losing everything. üòë
---
They were as much mine as they were yours. Do you think it played no role in some pve mains buying into private sessions?
---
I too am seeing much more crashing with this patch. I thought the last one was bad.. I crash about 4 times an hour!
---
To be quite honest, I live in a modest house (kids grown up and out) and drive not brand new but not civic vehicles. One is a classic that sits in the garage most of the time. I‚Äôm FAR from rich...but for the area I live in I‚Äôm quite comfortable. Disposable income is more due to being smart with money (despite some claims here) than having it falling out of my ass.
---
But whyyy... do you believe this game has a future at all? Like, what makes you think that? I'm a fallout fan that waited a bunch just to see if the game was worth buying and even when it was given out for nothing I didn't get it. I'm trying to understand people who still have faith in this that's all.
---
And strangely enough, I'm sure you got many, many more hits on your "opinion piece" than if you wrote a nice, non clickbait article.   But I'm sure that didn't influence your piece, we all know journalists are above that..... in case i need it /s
---
Well put
---
Check the bushes in the tunnel with the door.
---
Wrong... their scummy sales tactics and charging a subscription for things they promised us pre-release is why this is happening.
---
&gt;The biggest one? Storage space. An infinite sized scrap box indicates clearly that storage space being limited for stability is a load.
---
No, a very quick reddit search will show that scrap has never been the issue, unique assets,  guns, armor, etc are. The server doesn't care if you have 1 spring or 10K springs. It's a single simple asset (as opposed to complex asset) with a quantity value associated with it.
---
Edit: I should have looked at your post history before even bothering to reply,  you don't play the game often if at all, you're just another troll come to pile on
---
Saying that those buying this are the cause of every problem is exaggerated.
---
The only reasons we have lootbox and Microtransaction now is;
---
1. It wasn‚Äôt possible before.
---
2. Wasnt thoughts of.  if a company get a greedy idea, that it sells well or badly, nothing prevents other companies for doing so.( aside p2w lootboxes of Star wars battlefront 2 but it was way more extreme)
---
3. It‚Äôs legal. 
---
You can be angry towards those players, but don‚Äôt blame them and never attacks them.
---
Finally! You're the first one I've seen send their angst where it belongs. Zenimax is to blame for this abomination.
---
Most likely. No way would they taint the image of the subscription that just went for sale by not fixing that
---
Haha nah, today the weirdos came out to do free damage control for a greedy company
---
Too true
---
No but he took my money and made promises he couldn‚Äôt keep.
---
I don't know, then EVERYONE'S scrap would've disappeared.
---
While annoying in 100 ways, those people still speak to the overall perception of the game. Bethesda‚Äôs (and any deeveloper) goal is to have millions of people playing games like this. That‚Äôs how you make them profitable. They‚Äôll never hit those benchmarks if people have such a negative perception that some take the time to troll a game‚Äôs subreddit. 
---
It sucks for all of us who have to sift through it, and those of us who want to engage in constructive discussion and criticism. But it‚Äôs still a valuable indicator that the developer should be paying attention to.
---
Wouldn't that be better done by not replying?
---
^Hyperbole initiate! 
---
Funny how fo76 was suddenly a different game because they added a sub that let's you get cosmetics and decent qol perks.
---
And on bioware bring the victim, bioware was a victim when it got acquired. It's been an extension of EA for a while, bioware hasn't been a victim for a while.
---
Every game they release in the future is in jeopardy because of this shit. 
---
I know of people, including myself, who have bought every Bethesda game day one since Morrowind, who are now no longer buying Starfield or TES6 or a Fallout 5 day one. That caution is a direct result of Fallout 76.
---
The next game they release absolutely has to be a redemption, otherwise they're fucked.
---
If Wastelanders gets reviews that make it sound like they have truly made a real fallout experience and it is not accompanied with more content hostages I may consider a return. But I am doubtful, everything with this game had been disappointing, and it has to go above and beyond to counter the negative ill will it has engendered.
---
I am holding out for hopefully a real Elder Scrolls 6, but I am not a first day purchaser anymore, more like second or third month if the press and word of mouth is great.
---
I'm not fine with anything broken, im not even paying for anything.
---
Whaaa our game has turned into a monetization shit show. Please don't post about alternatives because my subreddit will turn into a ghost town.
---
It is spam. It is one thing if he posts a opinion, but to not give any sort of constructive criticism to the OP, and just say "K" to every post, that is called spam, son. Just look at his post history to see how many times he is doing it. Not going to engage any further on this.
---
\*edit\* why do you think his post got removed then?
---
So you're saying the branding alone is what makes something "pure Fallout?" So...every Fallout game is pure Fallout then...?
---
The only reason I'm giving you a hard time about this is because you claim that TRUE fans who play Fallout for over 40 hours will love this game, yet I've played no Fallout less than 40 hours and think this game is a trainwreck. You had made the "not a true fan" fallacy as the reasoning as to why people dislike it, which is proven false by myself and many, many others, so you must have some other reason as to why you still return to the game.
---
My best guess as to what you may be trying to get as is you like a Fallout skinned FPS with all other elements stripped out, but correct me if I'm wrong.
---
Obviously I don't care that you play it, I'll play it occasionally myself, but your original reasoning behind it is flawed.
---
The hostility is a direct result from this game still not working properly more than a full year after release
---
"responds" and "response" are two different words.
---
Once they get away with it and see it works it will be abused by companies is what they are saying
---
That last paragraph was really important to the point you're making. Because those people that are on this subreddit are making an informed decision. They know that they are supporting a company intent on hurting the customer and yet they are still doing it. Just like you said, they have no excuse.
---
I think the bonuses over the servers swayed people imo. If they had just bundled all that sans servers and didn't call it a subscription, still might have bought it. They would have to kill the scrap box and tent though. Tbh it was the dances for me lol
---
Wearing subscription premium gear is like wearing a MAGA hat at a Hillary rally, or a Hillary shirt at a MAGA rally. You are in the minority on a topic people are passionate about. 
---
Better get some thick skin because all the reddit threads in the world won't stop people criticizing you. Perks of living in a free society.
---
Like it or not wearing that gear is expressing your opinion, don't blame others for expressing theirs.
---
&gt;I'm not fine with anything broken, im not even paying for anything.
---
Yeah you are. If you bought this game, you basically told Bethesda that you will buy broken shit.
---
I want to see a pic of the nuclear winter helmet with the samurai armor
---
I just bought six memberships when I read this post.  Take that.
---
pls explain ?
---
" no matter how loud you "protest" ultimately nothing you say will matter "  
---
Damn and I thought i'm being too negative about this lol , buddy if you really think your opinion matters that little then i'm sorry to hear that, but every vote matters and every voice matters
---
If this was a free to play game you'd have a point
---
I'm new too, and I play by myself and I like it. I have never played any MMORPGs, never had any interest. I don't like co-opping anything. Sooo, this is just a nice way for me to relax, craft some stuff, and wander around aimlessly in a fake world.
---
It doesn't play like a fallout game at all. It's more of cross between mass effect and rage.
---
right! its kinda funny in a way
---
I will never ride first class ever again because its the right thing to do. Take that American Airlines! Amiright? If I ride coach, everyone should ride coach! /s
---
76 was started like 11 years ago. It was literally made in parallel with Fallout 4, how is that rushed? It began as an idea to give fo4 a co-op mode but required them to re-code the whole thing from the ground up just to get more then an individual in the game at a time
---
No Nuka November?
---
They‚Äôve consistently lied and scammed the players since this game released. Do I *seriously* need to list all the controversies over this game? They are liars. And grow some thicker skin, dude
---
Where are your sources for that? 
---
Lootboxes and subcriptions aren‚Äôt illegal and nearly give no loss in implementing them.
---
Even if it sell poorly, it‚Äôs still a little bonus in $, so don‚Äôt put all the blame on those who pays. They won‚Äôt ruins videos games with such silly things.
---
How much does it cost to play Fallout 76 today?
---
First of all it is reductio ad absurdum. Secondly it does not mean what you think it means. It does not apply here at all because no contradiction is being used. If you try to sound smart on the internet at least be sure about the words you are using.
---
Just saying the ESO weight is based on slots compared to pounds in Fallout which makes stacking junk harder for Fallout compared to ESO
---
Well as long as there are idiots like you who keep buying into scams, companies like Bethesda will keep putting scams in their games, ruining it for the rest of us.
---
&gt;Can‚Äôt believe i preordered this bullshit for it to go down to 20 bucks on Christmas 2018
---
If you pre-ordered the game, surely you must have played the "Break-It-Early-Test Application". I cancelled my $5 pre-order at GameStop the day before the official release date because I foresaw the game being a shitshow.
---
You should really read/watch video game news so that you're not tricked into buying a bad video game next time.
---
yea and your hard earned Cash!! welcome to the fallout 76 reddit! criticism is off the table I guess
---
LOL, this game is pure trash
---
Bethseda said that even though you cant seem them they should technically be there. So you can still use the unseen scrap to repair and build.
---
People still play fallout 76?
---
If you didnt like Fallout 4 then you're probly not going to like 76
---
People really talk like this game didn't cost money to buy
---
Funny, at least 2 downvotes, and not a single comment rebutting my post.  I'm sorry if your feelings got hurt, but the majority of gamers, outside of the circle jerks that are reddit and other forums,  dont really care how many mtx they put in the game.  BECAUSE WE DONT HAVE TO BUY THEM!!!!
---
Because people were expecting to get a Wolfenstein game that played like the prior 2 titles but with co-op. Instead, it was more rpg-like with bullet sponge baddies and having to repeat levels to get good enough to complete the next mission. It's a very different game from the 2 prior ones.
---
Oh I‚Äôm sorry I misunderstood that would be a nice look I run with the NW helm and the fireman suit looks real nice
---
Fanboys: lol bye Felicia
---
Also fanboys: pls buy Fallout pass or the game is ded
---
Lit up enemies and arrows? What game are you even talking about?
---
So, you say it‚Äôs all the fault of peoples that buy Microtransactions if that game is in this state???
---
My exact sentiments. After the bl3 rainbowfest I've recently given destiny 2 a try since bungie has been liberated. Addicted since Saturday.
---
I think your Right! 
---
Todd has been lying to sell games since he started with the company. Makes sense Pete is in on it too.
---
Yea, sorry about that, its just alot easier than typing microtransactions out lol
---
I bought the subscription, I and my friends play on a private world now and we have fun. If that bothers anyone they are certainly welcome to whine impotently at me while I don't pay attention and don't respond
---
That would be wonderful, will test it! Thanks for giving a real player to player response and not shitting on the game for the sake of it too.
---
This sentiment is a decade late
---
Haha Haha, his stuff is still there just a visual bug. I for one am loving the private servers.
---
Me neither, cause I play on a private server now :D
---
&gt;And why would your friends burn money on private servers and then play adventure anyway? Seems like a dumb waste
---
No, it's a very smart move economically if you buy atoms at all as you're getting them for almost half off with the price of the sub...and the cosmetics, tent and scrap bin. Private worlds are great for doing solo runs or team events without trolls
---
Thousands of hours and I waked away with the robot/fridge.
---
I knew that I'd be telling the defenders "I told you so"... I just didn't think it would be so soon.
---
I only gave them 13.
---
I think they are saying The Outer Worlds is now the alternative to Bugthesda games. I downloaded it last night, will hopefully get to play it tonight. I haven't played 76 in a couple of months now.
---
&gt;  (most likely this will be done sometime in the future).
---
You believe this based on what? Especially considering that Beth has actively reduced the number of atoms earned from gameplay.
---
What a shame
---
I think they're more upset of the principle of the matter rather than the cost. They are upset that a game they paid for is using the marketing tactics of a free to play game basically.
---
I think we have to understand that those of us who are furious about this love Fallout as much as the people who aren't. We just see BGS heading down a path that concerns us and we are trying to make noise in order to correct that.
---
You'd be hard stretched to find any of us who are trying to upset players who want to continue playing, maybe I'm being naive, but that is my assessment of what is happening and certainly where I am coming from.
---
Lol, like if videos games where ruined.
---
You can still have plenty of fun with this hobby. It was way more expensive with less contents in the past .
---
I'm not being negative, unlike you, I'm just being realistic.
---
Everything is gone forever, keep that in mind next time you‚Äôre considering buying *anything* in an always online game
---
I‚Äôm not broke living with my mommy so I can afford it. It‚Äôs only 13$ a month chump, step up or shut up.
---
Also now explosive laser bullshit free.
---
I‚Äôve been told many times this week that there is tons to do and that this game is amazing and that the only reason players are t coming to the game is because the complaining is misleading them. So just enjoy the abundant endgame content and stop complaining.
---
That‚Äôs what I am assuming too. Just looking to clarify.
---
Exactly correct! And it looks like OP has updated his post to reflect accurate information ($100/year, not /month).
---
Lol you don't believe that people are uninstalling? Are you the guy behind r/thathappened?
---
With a bit of BioShock to complete the whole thing.
---
Lol no worries. I was just too lazy to google it
---
They are private no one else logs in them with you, they are t reserved dedicated servers. But go look up how much a dedicated server costs real quick. And then make sure you look up one that wouldnt limit player experience lag and graphics.
---
Someone really enjoys those Bethesda boots
---
Well for starters, my friends pre ordered it and I traded him for games I didn't play anymore. So I never personally bought it lol.
---
But again, preordered, I never knew the game was broken. Regardless of the bugs, I enjoyed it. I had fun. I still have fun. 
---
I refuse to pay anything for atoms or any extra content. So I'm not sure what your point is here. A broken game and a $100 a year bonus feature set are two totally different things.
---
He wouldnt have to read a single post.  The headlines are a pretty clear indication of where the post is going, to understand how entitled alot the vocal members of most gaming subs are.  It's not just fo76, go to any game specific sub, and it's nothing but absolute toxicity
---
Bucking the trend may make it even better. 93 percent of nearly 100 reviewers recommend the game so far.
---
Pretty level.
---
Your also wrong, its $33 for the full game and $100 for a completely nonessential year of private server access
---
I wanted the Ranger Armor...the way I see it...I spent 13 dollars for a private world, cool outfit, stash box and 2nd camp AND got 1650 Atoms to spend. I would have bought all this separately at a greater cost... willingly. I played last night alone. I MEAN ALL ALONE! LOL. I had an entire server to myself and LOVED it. My stash box worked fine. I actually got to try stuff with out worrying I'd die and some one would loot my bag. With the "FREE" ( NOT FREE AT ALL BUT CHEAPER THEN BUYING ATOMS ) Atoms, I bought the spooky vender Halloween kit! That again, I would have gladly paid for anyways in the Atom shop. So all in all, yeah. I am very happy I bought it. For 1 month. I collected so many magazines and bobbleheads, alone. And then went to a reg. Server and GAVE THEM AWAY. For free. Cuz I can and I wanted to.  I dont tend to go in the direction of the masses over popularity. I go where I WANT TO GO CUZ IT MAKES ME HAPPY. And I give stuff away CUZ IT MAKES ME HAPPY.  
---
Cant we just all get along?
---
Now you have the right idea! lol
---
It also makes me feel like a younger man hahahah. All hip and shit using the new lingo lol
---
Just wait until they add a Club Level concierge room to The Whitesprings for all you one percenters and your first world problems. 
---
Don‚Äôt steal my idea Bethesda.
---
This sub is literally filled with people who rage at the mere thought that someone else might be enjoying a game they have a problem with.  It is literally like watching a bunch of religious fanatics lose their shit over the thought of two men or two women being in love.
---
What other people do on their own time with their own gaming system IS THEIR OWN DAMN BUSINESS.
---
Because when people enable business' to continue with bad practices, it affects the entire market. It's collective punishment, and every player suffers because of it. If one person buys into lootboxes like Star Wars Battlefront II, FIFA team building cardpacks, or this $100 subscription debauchery, they are giving EA, Activision, and Bethseda the green light to continue pushing these scummy practices down everyone's throats. 
---
And by playing the victim card, then complaining that everyone should be angry at the company instead, **is a pathetic attempt to avoid responsibility**, simple as that.
---
While I don't condone harassment, propping yourself as a target to play the matyr is asking for trouble.
---
&gt; last i knew you can get repair kits from the queen.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted,  I guess the trolls are out in force. I, for one, have so many damn advanced repair kits that I'm starting to drop them just to save weight...wish I could give them to low level folks
---
Wahhhhhhh wahhhhhhhhh
---
No problem, I just want to see if the colors match together before buying the samurai outfit :)
---
I agree that the bonuses are better then the private lobbies. The atoms alone are worth it if you're into that sort of thing. My only criticism is the Scrap Box being behind a pay wall. That dance is definitely the best emote so far.
---
They're trying desperately to make any money back from the tiny population that still die hard love fallout and are playing this completely broken piece of shit game.
---
literally*
---
And you know what? I get that, they don't care what I think they don't even care about the people that give them money because as long as they get money they are not gonna listen, literally the only ONLY way customers can have their voices heard is how they use their wallets
---
Time for Outer WorldsüôÇ
---
From a lore perspective could you squint and consider it a far-future of the House ending to New Vegas? Or does the backstory of the setting get too detailed, and the dates too off, for that to be the case? It would be nice to be able to, at least in my mind, consider it such.
---
Lack of transparency about what exactly? Everything I've listed out is common sense. Games as a service cost the company to support therefore it costs us and they have to incentivize players to purchase a subscription. This is hyperbole but it's like walking into a store, filling your cart up with stuff and then being upset that the store wasn't transparent enough that the items you put in your cart cost money.
---
No, it DOESNT affect me. If the company ever goes in a direction so far I begin to take issue with it then I'll just play something else. I dont let a hobby make me lose it.
---
My point is they are both an infinite storage even though they may function differently
---
No?
---
Doesnt mean that we should act like children and attack each other.
---
Ok so today i was able to join private server from my friend list. Its my first time to log on since the update. 
---
Question: as the host, are u able to filter/ kick out anyone that joined your private server? 
---
As the friend, i see people who have private server on my friend list. I can join any, do u (private host) see a pop up or notification that im joining you? And if so, can u decline out right that person joining your server?
---
&gt;The fact that you have to do that just to get a repair kit makes it extremely tempting for people just to go into the atomic shop 
---
Are you serious? I do a nuke a day on prime as a part of my regular routine,  many times on weekends.  I can't remember the last time she wasn't taken down...months at least. I wonder if you actually play the game?
---
üëçüèª
---
I love how everyone who buys in acts smug and above everyone for doing so, as if they‚Äôre not the dumbass
---
The last time I checked Pete Hines wasn't god and this quote was never inscribed on stone slabs to be delivered to a prophet by a burning bush as immutable scripture.
---
Bethesda planned on providing all of that free content by funding the game through purchases made in the atom shop... a plan that clearly didn't work out.  Either they find new ways to monetize the game while sticking as close to that "promise" as they can or they just continue bleeding money until it isn't worth the cost any more.  I cannot fathom why you people see the game shutting down as a preferable alternative to someone else paying so they can have a fridge or another free fast travel point so you can get everything else for free.
---
You're* (you are)
---
By saying "your", you are talking about "my".
---
commit toaster bath
---
You really think that cod not putting lootboxes in is some great achievement?  The only reason they removed lootboxes, is because it's a tremendous corporate line to get good publicity.  I can 100% promise you, that they will get their $$ one way or another. The only thing that will change, is they tactic they use to increase profit margins
---
I don‚Äôt wanna tell you what to do with your money, but let me tell you what to do with you money.
---
Because when people enable business' to continue with bad practices, it affects the entire market. It's collective punishment, and every player suffers because of it.

---
there*
---
You mean like wow?
---
That's fair.  Maybe we can consider that there are different types of Fallout fans, and this game appeals to one group over another?  I'm not even a big fan of the FPS aspect... so maybe it is the "skin".  I like the world, I like the lore, it feels like my home away from home, the place I go to unwind and escape from the real world.  I didn't mean to imply anything with the "true fans" so disregard that.  I guess it just feels like a lot of the hate directed at the game was from people who never played, people who consider Fallout just one of the long list of games they play and move on from, and fans that expected something different.  All of which is fair, but clearly there is a reason some of us continue to enjoy it for what it is, and we could try to deconstruct every aspect from camp creativity to bonding with friends, but instead I'm going to go back to actually playing it.  In spite of it being super buggy (still), in spite of my character now being a second class wastelander, in spite of there being not a lot for high level players to do right now, I can't change the fact that I'm still having fun in this world.
