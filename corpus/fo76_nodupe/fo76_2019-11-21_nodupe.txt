What I mean is, say they have 100 people on staff to do microtransactions and 50 to fix bugs. Clearly you need less microtransaction people and more bug fix people. Whatever the ratio, Bethesda should know what they need. They likely don't care because their products still sell besides being buggy as all hell.
---
---
---
Hope we get refunds.
---

---
I asked for the same thing.
---
Stupid change is stupid.
---
I don't think you have a clue what you're talking about nor what literally means.
---
Pa skins have been priced that high since launch and it hasn't changed.  If no one was spending atoms on them the price wouldn't be so high still which is supply and demand.
---
There's an item in the camp that is locked. That decoration stand.
---
We can't help you here. Send a ticket to support
---
Did you ever see the movie Fight Club? Remember, at the beginning, the comment about if the cost of a recall is greater than the cost of a lawsuit, the company doesn’t do a recall? 
---
That, but Bethesda
---
There's always caps in the banana power armor.
---
That looks really nice. That and the black paint for my handmade is on my list when they give me my 1st atoms.
---
Sure. Doesn't make what they're doing right though.
---
I'm sure you'll get downvoted for this very controversial opinion.
---
Just took one, decided to take them down because of budget. Could only fit 5 buildings into my build then 
---

They really need to implement a system in any online game with a monthly sub whereby if you surpass the cost of a monthly subscription with your micro-transaction purchases, they give you premium membership for as many months as you could buy with the amount you purchased.
---
Do the SQB fight Everytime you can and never buy a repair kit again.  I have nearly 200.
---
I've literally been almost the identical fight but it was back when I was around level 50 and ill equipped.  I took shots and everything I could and then ended up hiding inside the building with the door closed. By the time it was done there was two scorchbeasts dropping the acid Cloud thing and I ran out of pretty much all meds.  Ran for it, drop down into the query, hid behind some rocks, and waited for what seems like an eternity.
---
In retrospect I could have just logged off but instead I hid there for 15 minutes then made a dash for watoga and eventually got away.
---
Are you really complaining about the price of cosmetic items on a game that doesn't have a subscription fee?
---
no one does
---
krappa
---
Simple answer, it ain't. Bethesda has ruined any reputation they had for reasons like that.
---
There is another spawn at the ranger station in the bog. The building behind the station with all of the cages and the steamer trunk.
---
Maybe because they are being a dumpster fire
---
 They prolly will with Fallout 1st.
---
Creative name. Wonder if you can sell it at a vending machine or put it on display
---
Your argument might be reasonable if purchasing a product is the only signal available to the market and where capital is the only value that is placed on a commodity..
---
Actually discussing the merits of value of a product is an essential part of any functioning market - it is how actors within the market establish a sense of what value, monetary and also cultural, emotional etc on certain commodities, from which they can make rational, informed decisions.
---
An argument over whether $18 is good value for the product is how the market goes about establishing what "good value" means. 
---
If the actors within a market can collectively agree to place the value at $10, then they force a change in the offered price. Simply saying "Just decide what you want to buy!" is a naive simplification of how markets operate.
---
TLDR; because we live in a society!
---
Did you mean to comment here? Because this has absolutely nothing to do with anything discussed here.
---
Thats the tipping point for you calling them scummy?
---
The Bethesda account is constantly logged in on my Xbox not on my internet browser, so yeah after not logging in on that account on my Xbox since the creation of Fallout 4 I'm not going to know the password to get in. I guess I'm not as smart as you there bud, what I wanted is for Bethesda to see this post because I couldn't get a response to my email you circle jerker. Thanks for contributing nothing, you seem really good at it.
---
What did they give you exactly ?
---
20 is a good number...
---
Capitalism at its finest . The people with money will have the nicest stuff
---
Not gonna lie but i dont actually know... how many players are able to be per server?
---
If it is an easter egg, I think it's just poking fun at the idea that it's more likely Merle died there rather than survived. Most people that do survive cutting off a limb have typically gotten into a situation where they crushed that limb or it's frozen, making it so little oxygen and blood get to it. So at that point they lose less blood and can cut faster because they lose feeling
---
I don't think it's that.
---
When you're playing a game that you love and you get emotionally attached to it, pricing like this can be disruptive to that feeling. An overly-high price basically tells you that this item is not for you. It lets you know that you don't really count. It will leave some people with the feeling that their emotional investment to the game was wasted.
---
Look at the things that matter to most gamers. They want to feel like they can write a post, and that someone working on the game will notice it. They want to feel listened to. They need an emotional return on their emotional investment. 
---
Look at how many people post suggestions that they think will make the game better. Look at all the people who write bug reports. They want to belong and be involved, and it's all perfectly normal.
---
Look at how many times people will excitedly post things that start with "OMG THEY LISTENED!" It just recently happened with the Sonic movie. This is very important to a lot of people when it's about something that they love.
---
An $18 armor skin is the kind of thing that will make some players feel like the time, energy, and money they've spent on a game was wasted because it tells them that they never really mattered all that much in the first place. Emotionally, it's not all that different from courting a crush only to find out they're not interested in you, and that they've been stringing you along to see how much they can get from you. For a lot of people this realization is painful.
---
This is a very difficult line for companies to walk. If you care too much about players emotions you won't make as much money. Don't care enough and you make make higher profits but you will alienate some players in the process. Historically, Bethesda hasn't been terribly good at walking this line in terms of FO76 and has done too much that makes it obvious that players without tons of spendable income don't really matter.
---
What some of these people do to try and counteract these feelings is to demand that the people who can afford it stop buying it. They think if nobody buys it then the price will go down and then they can feel like they matter again.
---
That only works if the player actually mattered in the first place. They may have bought the game, and they may have spent $20 or $30 in the store after that, but they're not the ones pumping hundreds and thousands of dollars into the store so their significance is minimal.
---
This is also why corporations like Bethesda will hire "community managers" because they know players need a return on their emotional investments and it's a relatively inexpensive way to give that return. The recent Twitch stream is a perfect example of this. The whole event is designed to make players feel needed by interacting with them in chat, mentioning their names, and having prize give-a-ways. This is very effective for giving players a return on their investments.
---
The community managers are great at doing this too. They're usually very smart, talented people who are excellent at interacting with players. They naturally know what to say and do to make forums and streams a positive experience for as many people as possible. The really good ones don't even need much training. They're just naturals at making people feel good.
---
Regardless of this, when a skin is put up with an $18 price tag, some players are going to feel like crap when they see the price no matter how much other goodwill is thrown at them.
---
Check some of the posters at Train Stations. (No-one tell them anything more please ;))
---
Wow. Thanks for the heads up. Guess I'll have to monitor my budget now. Yeesh.
---
I have never seen a chainsaw in this game. Over 1000 hours in game too lmao
---
allegedly
---
So you're just gonna reeee forever? Awesome plan, man. I'm all for getting irrationally angry at video games, and I can't think of a better use of life than you spending your day constantly posting about a video game you bought for twelve bucks and occasionally play.
---
No touching!
---
Ok man...I can hear the hate tube coming through you....lol...content is still free if it's this Tuesday or next year.....it's the extras in the shop that costs  Free/paid for Atoms.....this is highly normal in the business world of gaming.....
---
Exactly. I just laugh at all these people that complain about this everyday but yet still continue to buy their products and play their products. Enjoy your shitfest 😂😂😂
---
That happened to me this morning too. I exited the game and when I came back everything was back to normal.
---
Something different and unique. Makes all my knickknacks really stand out more. I really like it!
---
Pfft. I don't know why you've been dv-ed for that comment. I got the damned fridge and the collector bot.. I have ZERO collection bots built in my CAMPS. I have one fridge that I've never put anything in cause its really not worth it. Both items I am ONLY using cosmetically. The bonus is so slight it's not worth having them if they don't fit your CAMP/ build. Totally agree with ya, dude.
---
That worked. Thx for the info.
---
&gt;It's literally not finished though. A finished game doesn't ship with this many problems.
---
Yes, it does. Again -- *your criteria for a finished game doesn't matter*. You deciding to call it a beta doesn't magically make it so. 
---
But with the hundreds of better videos games out there that *are* finished to the criteria you demand... why not go play them? Why spend all this time and energy on a game you dislike and only spent twelve bucks on..?
---
Like I get the need to call them out on how they ignore game breaking bugs, for their shitty Atom Store pricing, for the basic lazy nature of the quests etc. 
---
But you're obsessively arguing, day in, day out, over how much you don't like a video game?
---
k.
---
I imagine Wastelanders will populate that area, since Rose has been calling raiders for months.
---
they could have been dicks and just gave everyone 5 atoms and called it good...lol
---
Okay. I'm gonna give you an example of why that is a terrible idea. With one generator, a couple connectors, and a lot of copper I can make a camp that will crash the WHOLE server by just existing. Lights. A camp that consists of only lights tanks performance of even the best machines out there. Now imagine if I could make more lights.
---
Haven't seen it for two weeks. Go there often
---
I crafted a small batch of lowest level HM's this morning; trying to build up my mod count since the new matt black skin dropped. 😎 I knew 3 mods to start. Crafted 4 HM's. Scrapped them and learned 3 new mods. Now need A LOT more screws!
---
Thank you for chipping in for my new jacket.
---
Sincerely yours, Todd.
---
I want to believe
---
Did you play on console? I have a pretty good but not great gaming laptop and I only crashed 1.5 times during 40-50 runs.
---
At least with the hoodie you can recoup the price by reselling, plus it keeps you warm and keeps your fit fire. $18 PA is just greedy as fuck
---
My build is high in Per/Agl/Luck (15/11/12), so I have room to play with all three. 
---
Thanks for the feedback; I'm thinking Bloody Mess most immediately solves me "I need to get better at killing" issue, so that's a good start.
---
You can implement it client side, but everyone else won’t be able to see it. 
---
Dunno if that helps you or not 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Do the power plant events and you will get it pretty easily.
---
It doesn’t happen too often. I’ve used it since it came out and I never ran into many issues. It’s weird how things like that work, some people will have no problems with certain things while some people have a lot of issues with things like disconnecting, losing things, PA glitching. It sucks.
---
Maybe I shouldn't move my camp yet after all then. I have both set up still.
---
i didn't downvote you bruv.  As for how they handle it, I dunno.  Maybe they will give you a separate "private server CAMP" thhat you can only deploy on a private server, which allows you to build a larger camp.  So basically you wind up with 2 CAMP options - adventure more, and private mode.  whichever camp you deploy has a specific budget.
---
Kek, why are you being downvoted?
---
No prob, I would flip if I lost 4 of my 5 characters, each has a unique play style and camp theme, lets me pick a style each day, would have burned out long ago otherwise!
---
That was my mistake..
---
ah thats okay. i appreciate the thought!!!
---
Same.
---
thanks so much bro! ill look for you. ill be on in about an hr or 2!
---
It’s for sale at the Enclave bunker, production wing.
---
I had no idea. Thanks man
---
I hear that.
---
Happens often enough for me.
---
This company is in the toilet.
---
Us: "How hard can it be?"
---
Them: "yeah we dont have an ETA"
---
Not sure about a level requirement, but I did acquire it through Watoga Station.
---
You do make a lot of sense as well, i personally am one of those who just want to build and build, i just got spoiled by fo4 mod scene tbh, but even then my game crashed constantly despise all the “performance booster” mods i installed.
---
It's been this way since player vending.
---
Ty for info!
---
It's okay, Mulder, I actually have proof:
---
[https://bethesda.net/community/topic/373399/silo-mainframe-explosive-weapons-don-t-work/29?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/373399/silo-mainframe-explosive-weapons-don-t-work/29?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Same
---
It was confirmed by a mod in an earlier post
---
Its every 3-4 months they have a new event..... and for a ton of the events you get the chance to unlock prestige edition skins or really awesome chromas, ward skins, emotes.
---
It's like if Fo1st unlocked the ability to grind for 3 to 4 different cosmetic outfits+ multiple colors for those outfits, and then also allowed you to grind for different badges like the one you get for buying Fo1st. 
---
Sure Fo1st gives you a bunch of stuff for free, but in the long run how does that extend playing time? With League the event passes require you to play the game to unlock the serious benefits. I'm an example, I dont buy the event passes normally but when the championship thresh chroma and loading border came out I ate up the event pass and went from 1-3 games a day to 5 or more a day during the event to grind out what I wanted.
---
Just buy it from someone
---
Yeah but when we paid we didn't know we would be receiving better customer support so that is kinda lucky for us
---
I’ve had no problems on PS4
---
Gotta make 10,000-100,000% more then it cost to manufacture. 
---
Why this is bad:The average hardware store is making 32% from markup.
---
Since ihis is digital, they produce it once and pay the creator and that is that.  A hardware store has to reproduce a physical item with each sale. 
---
 
---
50,000£ screw anyone?
---
Yeah, I did manage to do last week's with those exact same three things, actually!  I didn't have a flamer and then found one on an enemy so took a little barbecue break at Morgantown Airport to get it done easily.
---
[removed]
---
no comment when I found this out but thank you.
---
As others have said- power plants you’ll get it after event or buy it at enclave
---
Wait, the whole reason I bought the orange was I thought it would look cool mixed with the black. You're saying I can't do that any more?
---
This.  On the third time (I think) completing the Power Plant quest you will get the plan (assuming you don't already know it)
---
quality over quantity
---
Did they just explode before you could hit them?
---
Thank  you I'll be sure to do that.
---
Yeah swapped to Xbox, picked up an X cheap and the detail in games is ridiculous for anything that's proper X Enhanced haha.
---
yeah ;(
---
For regular PS4 you have a couple options, SSD or SSHD (Like the Seagate FireCuda)
---
The regular PS4 doesn't have the I/O capability of the PS4 Pro, so it isn't able to take full advantage of what SSDs can deliver. The SSHD (hybrid drive) on the other hand is a good fit performance wise for the PS4 and is also less expensive. The hybrid drives are basically fast spinning disk with a really large solid state cache buffer for serving recently accessed content quickly.
---
Personally I'd opt for the SSD, but if budget is a concern then the SSHD would be a huge improvement over the stock drive.
---
r/ARG
---
Even if you bought everything in the shop; which they’d love, you can’t use it all. I don’t want to have to choose which purchase to use. I want to use as many as I can all at once.
---
now you gotta get extended or dual blade
---
what's your upload speed and ping
---
I don't agree.
---
Well if you're not gonna take this seriously then I'm done with the conversation
---
Are you using wifi? Tends to be a bit better if you have a cabled connection
---
They do the same thing on restaurant menus. When the steak is $40, $22 for the pasta seems reasonable.
---
a wonderful day as it sounds to me lol 😂
---
dude that's awesome right?
---
Like you, I'll consider buying stuff from the Atom Shop when the bugs have been fixed and features like text chat, a global trading post and perk card loadouts have been added. Which means probably never.
---
In contrast, I shelled out a lot of money on cosmetics when I played Guild Wars 2. The game was stable, virtually bug-free and had tons of QOL features. Plus, the cosmetics were cheaper and looked way cooler than those in the Atom Shop.
---
how?  you don't have a scrapbox to loose anything in the first place.
---
Never came close to hitting my budget, but the bungalow I bought last week takes up way too much. Had to cut back on other stuff.
---
You can always start a new character just for NW. It's what I did so I didn't have to jack up my main. The rewards are account based, not by character, and you'll eventually have a 2nd high level character
---
Beths 3£ horse armour is at fault for those two examples though.
---
Got mine in whitesprings for about 500 caps
---
There is isn't there. But if you're in pa, and just want to down the Queen, I get why he thinks it's good value.
---
I'm thinking this is exactly why the pushed the release back. They're doing real QA this time so they don't tank the game. This is supposed to be it; the re-launch to redeem it all.
---
We know if this isn't a stellar feat of resurrection and the game dies with this awful reputation, Bethesda may very well be looking at a loss of AAA reputation and the community's patience won't be there anymore.
---
I'm not arguing about how I don't like the game, I'm arguing that it isn't finished. Which it isn't. This isn't something I'm making up based on my own criteria. A game with this many issues isn't finished. Look at virtually any other game released for full price. They don't have close to this many problems. Because if they do, the game isn't released yet. Because it isn't finished yet.
---
It's not unfinished based on my criteria. It's finished based on Bethesda's criteria. And they're wrong.
---
Like the breaking bad Easter egg in the savage divide.
---
They'll be giving back the following amount of components to everyone:
---
Vault Steel - 150

---
Ultracite - 150
---
Black Titanium - 300
---
Nah I would prefer to not see the number reduced.
---
The cornucopia backpack is a little smaller than i had imagined. Thank you!
---
Why do you think its necessary to complain about it? If I see something I can't afford I just ignore it and move on. Assuming I even want it in the first place.
---
I think you just smoke it
---
Ps4
---
&gt; Its every 3-4 months they have a new event..... and for a ton of the events you get the chance to unlock prestige edition skins or really awesome chromas, ward skins, emotes.
---
u wish we got since mid year arcade, high noon, project, worlds, from august to november
---
A company can be scummy and do things that aren't always scummy, allowing new things to be called scummy independently of the company itself being scummy.
---
what does the responder bot have??
---
gamerZsoul on YouTube does a video about the new items every week.
---
They're giving four of those packages to each player. So everything above x4.
---
Im most likely going with a lever action when i find one lol
---
That’s awesome! I had no idea
---
Thank you!
---
That is ridiculous.
---
Why not just give them unlimited amount of everything, and be done with it?
---
That way there's no load on the servers, and we the non-subscribers can get 1k lbs instead of 800lbs stash space.
---
no problem 👍
---
Nah you get 3 star legendaries there. At least I have been getting some recently
---
Yup, forgot to mention that.
---
This is Fallout 76, there is never nothing to complain about. Lol
---
I want to say this may be related to an unyielding build. Is that your build?
---
Yeah, I figured it might've been a console performance issue. :/ I'm sorry to hear things went poorly for you during the event; I hope they optimize any future ones better for their console players.
---
Dying when encumbered
---
I assume you're using things lkke Unyielding or Excavator armor?
---
Old bug that's come back, yipee...
---
Budget is a fickle mistress my friend. One thing I've learned is to eliminate all but 1 turret (and even then you don't need that) attach a random power connector like the standing small wood one or large pylon with the little light and run power to that. For some reason enemies target crops and pylons more frequently than anything else. So I just have a small "backyard" decoy.
---
Gotta look good for those rich dudes that never played a game in their life. You know Providence Equity.
---
"But when you move in two Gutsy robots start firing at you. They're not much of a problem" this is the biggest understatment of the year.
---
Damn; wish my scrapbox bugged out. Those that did have it happen are probably getting back 2x-2.5x the junk they lost.
---
Found the under eighteen. Either that or the parent who puts their twelve year old in front of Fallout 76 for the day so that the rest of us adults playing the game get to babysit your kid so you don't have to.
---
Ive lost a bunch of stuff over the past year and was even able to grab video of it happening once. All of my tickets have ended the same way with them saying they cannot restore lost items. If they give 10k lead, plus the thousands of other mats, to these players im going to be really annoyed
---
Apparently they can now.
---
Sell one at a vendor for 25k lmao
---
Scrounger perk and super duper combined with ammo smith also helps.
---
Wear the Cultist Headwear/Bindings and run out from behind buildings (or from really dark areas) when they get close for added hilarity and hijinks. Hell, it sometimes even works on high levels...
---
"I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further." -Bethesda
---
Forget the budget, I want my money back because I can't keep flux in it and that's the only reason I bought it.
---
That's super cool, good job, I'd give you  Silver except I spent them all rewarding people for porn \*oops\*
---
If thatz truely what theyre getting seems a bit unfair, hell 75 of each flux? Sure I would of bought a month to get all that + atoms.
---
 I'm sure the odd person lost more than this, but I highly doubt the majority has anywhere to close to this loss.
---
bull barel and marine armor helmet
---
It's for the full immersion of prewar America after the economic collapse - notice how in game adverts have everything priced ridiculously high (A copy of Hot Rodder was, like, $40)
---
Actually, 4x all of the components I've listed, since they give you 4 scrappable objects that'll grant you all of these.
---
Alpine River Cabins. Specifically, if you follow the power lines at the camp to the south, you can find a treehouse a few paces away from the main area that proves the whole thing (including ground shaking, rotating paintings, closing doors) is faked.
---
YES. And winterized/military paint for every power armor. And bloodworms.
---
So many fallout 4 assets that would be super easy to implement. What a shame.
---
It is not and Im not overencumbered when I perish.
---
Si Señor
---
Yeah pretty much! I had made my floating house look like it was held up by a cloud of smoke.. now it’s help up by a fart of orange air 😭
---
What console do you use?
---
It is not, I run mostly health regen and chameleon and I'm not overencumbered.
---
PS4
---
That's unrelated to the patch. It's an existing random bug, usually rebooting "fixes" it.
---
So everyone with a scrap box is getting 600 vault steel??? That's crazy.
---
Ah okay, I know a few ways to help on Xbox but not sure about PlayStation,  sorry. Hopefully you'll find a fix soon!
---
My fault for using a word that can be misinterpreted.
---
With all due respect,what i meant to say was, when i get to the locations,say for instance the Ski Slope and run up and down a hundred times nothing happens.
---
When i visit the other locations i get exactly the same results.
---
I am well aware of what one is supposed to do yo earn the Badges.
---
Other Gamers part of this Game is broken.
---
I am not risking reinstalling though just for a High Capacity Back Pack.
---
That is when it's happened to me in the past, but last night and tonight, I am underweight, out of PA and not using Unyielding.
---
Not sure if everyone, those who lost those items for sure will though.
---
No only the people who lost their junk and submitted a ticket.
---
They could before, just not with this new item.
---
They wont lol
---
Yeah but still 600 vault steel is insane. I worked my ass off to get the 162 to craft my set lol
---
Is this bait
---
I don't remember any instances of such occurrence before.
---
Yeah what's the point of buying a utility item and it doesn't do its job... Speakung of budget I lost about 30% budget from my camp from bugs and the development still haven't fixed it and gave my budget back... This happened around may or June...they tolled me to scrap my camp and start over that it might fix it...I have a highly symmetrical camp even all the power conduits are.. Just the power and wiring took about 10 hours to get everything lined up just right...no way in hell I'm going to scrap a 30 hour camp build
---
just trying to make the world a better place 1 settlement at a time
---
Boredom. If a camps locked ill look for a way in just cause its something different to do like a challenge. Alot of people lock their camp but leave easy ways in like putting a bench right by a window or using the large windows.
---
They need to stop with Making the wall papers count as more against budget. Just make it another wall with the texture... figuratively speaking that is what it is anyhow.
---
More or less the whole concept of wall paper screws players who like their camps. Because you literally cannot build much if you use wall papers I seen recently released in stone shop. It is like placing two walls on ya build budget. What dumbass thought that out at Bethesda..
---
Ooohhh...
---
I suddenly realized that i also lost my scrap, must msg Bethesda :D
---
Oh, this is *super* cute. Very cozy.
---
With mine, it’s just a 1 by 2 windowless room
---
I am a big costume person and will buy atoms and generally don't mind paying 15-20 dollars for packs or whatever
---
but lets be honest this is a reskin of a suit that was sold with 2 skins originally in it for like 15$ - everything is the same except the lame color 
---
that said I'd pay 20$ if they pulled the damn voice chip from it.......
---
Pay to win or bug to win. Thats an insane amount of scrap.
---
So Boss Elder Mack made 300! Damn.  I'll be honest it is a bit intimidating to see him, inkihurricane, TxStategrad, Memento_Mori (my friendly nemesis), and Madamexmurderess, to name a few all in the same lobby.
---
Nope. How else are they going to remind you you dont have it? Lol
---
Because it's the end of times and I want what you have. Whether its screws, ultracite, or simple steel... My existence is more important to me than yours. Sorry not sorry. And this is coming from a player that wants for literally nothing in game. But most of us are lone wolves. Unless we are striking a civil deal, I won't trust you and you must give your life for me to craft things. Pretty simple
---
So they are giving way more scrap than they ever could have stored prior to the scrap box eating items? Makes me wish I lost my scrap. That list is way more of everything than I have, especially when you multiply it by 4.
---
Bummer. Been online the last 2 nights for 4ish hours with no hitches
---
At this point, if you're still playing Fallout 76 after all the abuse Bethesda has hurled at you, nothing is going to snap you out of your Stockholm syndrome. The player base has made it amply clear that no matter how badly Bethesda screws them over, they'll joyfully fork over $10 for a pink camouflage pistol and spend the next day working as an unpaid bug tester. So why the hell would they change now?
---
I do a walk around if i see a possibility ill try a few times but if its sealed up like that i just keep shopping. I like to see if theres any clever design but its mostly just something to do. Sometimes i just sneak around and try to see how long before i get spotted but most people dont care plus im holding out that someone has a super secret vendor with amazing deals hidden in there.
---
Strip naked, remove all perks, logout, reboot. Pray.
---
Uh, no. I’d gladly pay ten times that amount for an Instigating +Power Attack +Strength Super Sledge and not even blink an eye. 
---
Even at just scrip value, a trash 3-star weapon is worth a ***minimum*** of 400 caps. 
---
10 caps per scrip?  Yeah, I’ll buy that all day long, kid.
---
Yep kill enough critters quickly it will spam the coms.
---
Store them. Works just as well.
---
I've had them shooting one another. My first experience with it saw me waste 10 repairs or so.
---
Well, now that you told everyone, they'll hotfix it tomorrow.
---
Freaking autocorrect. I fixed it. 
---
That was what I meant. There’s no Buffout recipe so he is clearly wrong in his claim.
---
Yeah what the fuck Bethesda, literally NOBODY asked for that, you couldn’t spend your time fixing the broken +250dr when reloading inscription? Things that players actually asked for?
---
W t f
---
You do you, my man. Could have also just left it as is though.
---
That said. Word of advice from one person to another, though? That level of paranoid mistrust over discussions that don't matter? It's unhealthy. Take it from someone who had their entire high school years filled with that sort of shit.
---
Hope you have a good one all the same.
---
No, that’s for dirty commies.
---
It's already announced coming with fallout 1st.
---
😱
---
Sweet deal
---
Right, it's very important to support Fallout 76 and tell the AAA industry "Please, keep releasing unfinished games full of microtransactions and lies."
---
Rare apparel
---
Yeah, nobody would have done MTX if it wasn't for horse armor. /s
---
What platform are you on?
---
huh.  maybe you lost scrap and didnt know?  I didnt get an email.  they sometimes show up in spam, but nothing there either.
---
No, 1800 is silly. I'd pay $10, max not $18.
---
Bitch, I already paid for the game. Motherfucking whales have been pouring thousands into it since launch. You think your money is going to deva to fix things? Are you mentally challenged??
---
Curiosity. People don't like feeling like they're being left out of something.
---
The real game breaking bug with the prime skins is that they never say "Let Freedom Ring!". :P
---
Make just windowed walls around you. To get in change a wall into a door then walk in and cancel the change. The  you are inside a window walled room with them wondering how to get in.
---
They already nerfed cav and sent it doesnt make you that hard to kill anymore even in its hay days you could kill people using that armour easy if you knew what you were doing, honestly whats the point of pvp if there are no legendary effects if I want pvp like that ill play any shooter not an mmo style game like 76. If you want that pvp like that go play nulcear winter. Your idea of balanced pvp is subjective and wrong. If someone has better gear and levels they deserve to have an advantage over you in pvp this is an mmo not call of duty or apex. This is not a skill based shooter its based on primarily character strength - it has nothing to do with balance its just you aren’t willing. Your excuse of “balanced pvp” is just an excuse for you being not willing to put in the work to get good gear. Not only that 90% of the playerbase has no idea how to pvp in this game so you can do very well with some 1 star gear in most cases. In fact you don’t need “god”gear to have a chance with guys who have it each star past one helps you less having decent 1 or 2 star items gives you a fighting chance through in some stealthboys and a 1 star tesla and you can compete
---
Yea, that's quite generous.
---
If they had announced it as a part of the subscription, it'd be denounced as pay to win... Even though this would financially be worth it. The hours saved grinding...
---
So can I get this if I sign up now?? Lol
---
[speaks Chinese]
---
THIRST
---
ZAPPER
---
OR
---
RIOT
---
U are all wrong!!! Its not 18 dollars, it only costs atoms. Atoms are free to earn. So stop saying its 18. BECAUSE ITS NOT, IT LESS
---
Www.Bethesda.net
---
This. The boredom + the hope to find a secret vendor is what makes me always do this kind of thing too...
---
If you unfollow the quest (I usually do it from the map) then even when you go back to TRY to do the quest... it won’t show up. Think: claim workshop. I’ve literally claimed stuff and then couldn’t figure out why I couldn’t see how many waves I was dealing with... lol! But that should stop the auto-load.
---
This is spot on the case. Ten years of spaghetti code and embedded bugs cant BE fixed.
---
What
---
Do yoirself a favor and save your money. The game is garbage
---
No, it’s just buggy, I like the game, I had it on PS4 but it sucked on it
---
That's actually horrible.
---
Yet another thing that exists as a buildable item in 4. I only mention it because that means 99% of the work is already done.
---
Omg how did i not know about this!! Thanks!
---
The problem is mostly related to the fact pistols take agility perks, making their sneak synergy...complicated, otherwise theyd'd be 100% viable i am sure
---
Agreed, but I can’t stand people who edit every single time they get an award
---
Happened to me today!
---
I have random scorched beast dna placed around my camp, it won't let me pick it up, and my turrets keep firing at nothing, and the SB queen did her disappearing act after we killed her this morning. Updates are amazing.
---
it will show up in the vendor after you learn the large generator. I bought the large generator, learned it, then immediately bought the fusion one from the same vendor.
---
100gb, 2x 50gb
---
Had a great afternoon and evening picking up Legendaries.  Started at Wes Tek with six Legendaries.  A 2\* in the front yard, a 3\* Super Mutant Hound, two 3\* and two 2\* Super Mutants inside.  Went over to the big dish and got a 1\* in the back building.  On the way out attacked by a pair of 2\* SB's.  Headed to Moss Town and  ran into a roadblock with three Super Mutants, one a 3\*  further towards Moss Town attacked by a pair of SB's1 &amp; 2 \*.  Got to the Fissure there and a 3\* popped.  Had six more SB's pop out while I sat on the Fissure but only two were Legendary, 1\*.  Went back uphill to the Savage Divide and ran into a 3\* Super Mutant and three normals at a campsite I hadn't seen before.  Once I hit the main highway and headed north had 2\* SB attack.  Then a little further north towards the Pumpkin house a 3\* Super Mutant and as we were fighting a 1\* SB joined in followed by a 2\* Death Claw.   Then game froze up as I fired my Vampires .50 and SB sonic attacked and Deathclaw was banging on the bus I was using for cover.  Never had so many Legendaries in one day.  Two crap 3\* drops, one 2\*and the rest 1\*, all script fodder.
---
Sure, sorry if it took long.
---
https://imgur.com/a/256G2pM
---
Well, the issue is people still buy things at that price... why would they lower it if it sells as is?
---
Yep. Fuck Bethesda, those fucking assholes and their actually fucking successful, yet scummy business models.
---
I need 2 times the install space of the entire game to update it? That can’t be right.
---
Don't know about the US equivalent law, but in Australia a company can be in deep poo if they advertise stuff as "on sale" or at a discount when they haven't in fact been available at all. It's considered a deceptive breach of the trades practices act.
---
It is right. The PS4 makes a copy of the game when applying updates in case something goes wrong.
---
Congrats for your milestone level! I’m 232 and climbing and still haven’t tired of the game. Just about every time I log in I find something new.
---
I played a lot like this I’m not level 400 but the play style is very similar
---
I believe Grahm has fusion gen plans too. I usually find him wandering near Wilson's autos in the forest region.
---
That's awesome! I been grinding hard trying to get the explosive, bloodied, or even assassin's but no luck yet :/
---
Do you know if it has the same voiced lines as the original Liberty Prime shins or are there new ones?
---
It really bugs me that you don't always know who bought what, because sales can happen when a lot is going on!  I like your idea of a transaction record.
---
I’m sorry but there’s no way that’s true. I have updated large games (fallout 4 comes to mind) with far less storage space available. I’ve updated fallout 76 with less storage space available!
---
Oh that will look awesome, just gotta keep an eye on budget that's all.  I end deleting and adding till my camp looks just right, lol.  Stay filthy!
---
Seems like a new bug. 
---
u/ladydevann
---
plenty of outrage is what you missed mostly
---
My favorite Easter Egg in fo76 so far is the Jesco White dancing stand out east. 
---
He has a note next to him insinuating that he is one of the White family members.
---
Fuck Bethesda pretty much
---
Fuck me
---
I destroyed a great lever due to this.
---
Have you tried not using aid items?
---
My turrets keep shooting random tree and ignoring enemies... I don't know how they managed to fuck that up.
---
"Many handmades died to get this information."
---
Lol haha that’s awesome! Great find! I wonder what else is out there?
---
I \*think\* so... then again I did love me some mods :D
---
A thought maybe ... I wonder if when attacking mobs one of your turrets ends up in the line of fire of the other turret. Maybe it then thinks the first turret is an enemy and attacks back? Haven't tested this yet.
---
Daaamn.. that sucks 😢
---
May they rest in peace.
---
I play the game the same way pretty much, only a handful of times have I ever grouped up &amp; that was with some higher level players that really gave me a boost when I first started.  Bugs aside, I enjoy the game, I play both on public servers &amp; my fallout 1st. The players I have made friends with are free to join me anytime, anywhere.  Wastelanders really isn't a big deal for me, I put myself in the mindset the world was created in. 25 years after a nuclear war just how many survivors would there really be? Even the raider players bring something to the game, though I don't PVP. It's the unknown quanity...friend or foe I guess. I leave stuff for new players &amp; gear some up. There is plenty to do to keep you busy &amp; exploring if you just chill &amp; enjoy the game. Congrats on level 400...I have a long way to go for that milestone...I just hit 128. I wish we could build settlement towns...that would really add to the experience.
---
Yeah it was great.  Luckily they Purveyor have me a BE reload Lever a few weeks later. I got super lucky that I found another great lever!
---
Do you people seriously not understand why there was a limit of one placed in the first place?  It's the same reason there's a limit on lights. Particle effects, light lighting effects, are a large load on graphics processing.  
---
Finding out that you could now have two of these placed should have been an instant "Oh... this is definitely an oversight and will likely get patched out fast" moment.
---
I guess she felt bad for you, cause that’s also a really awesome weapon !
---
you're comparing apples to oranges, fixing this would have literally taken less than a minute to reclassify the halloween variant in the same limited category as the original.  Don't try pulling a shit argument that they're not allowed to fix anything unless they fix everything else first, no matter how big a difference there is in complexity.
---
Someone forgot to hide the post karma
---
If you lock yourself, I'll glitch to hug your damn character :P sometime I'd love to see a kind of tip box. But seeing how well 5.56 ammo sells, giving 5.56 is like giving caps.
---
You do realize that every Tuesday for the past month we've had people making the EXACT OPPOSITE argument that all of the recent additions to the atom shop have sucked and they need to focus more on adding more new stuff right?
---
Also do you SERIOUSLY think that flipping a switch for a purveyor sale or seasonal event would actually require having someone stop whatever they're already working on?  Or that  they're going to look at stuff they purposefully removed like explosive energy weapons and just go "Ah fuck it, lets toss some more out there"?  Or that the the person working on wallpaper textures for the atom shop would actually have anything to do with whatever team is working on whatever delayed wastelanders?
---
No it is not a one time use key. You can use it over and over again.
---
 Key 3 and 7 as well.
---
It's cool to make money. The entire point of the game is to make money via Atomic shop. Not to make things fun for players. Granted, a minimum of fun must be maintained, but so long as most players are okay with a mediocre skinner box, they'll stay and buy stuff.
---
For many microtransaction stores, sometimes they'll have a high price tag on an item and use "Sales" to motivate people to buy them before they become expensive again.
---
You get a clue and realize that they don't give a single shit :D
---
Fans very angry! Community full of hate online. Community in game is as nice as ever. A couple new things here and there, nothing ground breaking. Wastelanders update delayed until (probably) early 2020. Battle royal mode is here if you missed that
---
Had this happen to me paid 10k for a quad ffr 10mm pistol and was looking at the paints on it then was having a friend help me mule and I forgot to take the paint off and got carried away dropping him my weapons and accidentally dropped and destroyed the pistol.
---
Nice ! I’m always moving and tweaking my camps . I always get bored and try to work the art of building .
---
And I a completely optional purchase.
---
Legit can we all just get the fuck over this, we all know that fallout 76 is made by greedy bastards but the only reason I and many others come to this sub is to see fallout 76 content not just fucking complaints by over half of the goddamn community. Like does every person need to complain? Can they just go to another game?
---
Because the game is nothing more than a cash grab at this point. I’d argue to say it’s a worse cash grab than NBA2k games.. 🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Thing is, I want them to fix the game before adding to it. Don't add to a broken game. But Bethesda is doing neither.
---
Has this been confirmed?
---
And here I am actually preferring the nuclear winter theme as it actually sounds gritty, dark and badass. It doesn't fit 76, but I think it feels more "Fallout", kinda like the theme of Fallout 3, which is my favorite. Oh well.
---
I see a lot of posts from new players struggling to advance in the game. Which reminds me of the time when I thought I had "lost" game and would need to start over. But, like you said, I just kept playing and things started coming around. Having had that initial struggle just makes my progress in the game even more satisfying.
---
It's not in ash heap anymore
---
At launch? No, it was in no way ready to be shipped but it shipped anyway. Which was a total travesty. 
---
Now, in it's current state? Sure. It's in a playable state from start to finish, and to the extent that people have sunk hundreds of hours into it and are willing to pay subscriptions for some premium convenience content. As much as I hate to admit it, I've only hit a few bugs in a lot of playtime, and none of them were game-breaking. It's a sometimes janky but totally playable game. With a really insidious and shitty microtransaction model, which is irrelevant, but still shitty.
---
&gt;It's unfinished, period, not based on my criteria. It's just not finished. But what's worse is it IS finished based on Bethesda's criteria. And they're wrong.
---
If it's not based on your criteria... whose criteria are you basing it on? You've even admitted Bethesda are using a different criteria. You might *feel* that it's not finished, but you're feelings aren't facts. 
---
Basically your entire argument boils down to "they're WRONG and I'm RIGHT."
---
Downvote for being honest - awesome community :)
---
I wish I could make your post sticky and upvote it a million times.
---
6 Nukashines looks pretty sharp on that, not gonna lie.
---
That’s right but that’s not what activision sees, they see a proven successfully way of making money and they want to capitalize on it.
---
I miss it :(
---
That's one thing I love, the community in game is so freaking awesome! It really is awesome!
---
Damn... didn’t think about this. I would be fucking pissed.
---
&gt;  other way could alienate people on the other side. If the content has to be designed to handle large parties then the people who want to play solo or in small groups will struggle more to complete that content.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; this isn’t an MMO, it’s not designed with large group raids in mind, nor should it be
---
Are you kidding me? The Scorchbeast queen was made for everyone on the server to show up and have something to kill.
---
Those records are in the game already (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/377423829187690499/646935291868741634/unknown.png), unless they plan on updating the game (alongside the records) before they'll start giving those items back to the players in a couple of days then they are final.
---
haha that backpack looks corny in the store but it actually looks cool on your character
---
Makes sense, I did get it before the fix
---
THIS IS GRAFTON’S MAYOR
---
It would be nice if NW included like a giant wall of fire sweeping across the map that would just wipe out all those AFK players when it got to them.
---
Just kidding around but seriously if you do want to play AFK do the right thing and turn team fill off so you are not screwing over the active players. I am a team of one when I do my bush hiding.
---
Dunno if it's allowed here. The game is priced well on Cdkeys. A bit more trustworthy than G2A
---
you can literally measure their desperation as the game went on.
---
release: atoms easy to get, things added in store stayed in store
---
later: store moved to a FOMO /Fear Of Missing Out model with things removed/recycled, Atom combinations got zanier and generally harder to get
---
Now: Subscription added plus everything else.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Personally I think the biggest culprit was that the crap they put on the store was hot shit people wouldn't wear if it was free. the rhodhedron suit? cryptid enthusiast? woodsman? nobody asked for that stupid shit.
---
I don't understand why a year in we don't have the ability to lock certain items from any trade or inventory transfer. It makes no sense to me.
---
That’s not the point though. It’s the fact that they WILLINGLY overlook game breaking bugs for stupid shit like this. Nothing to do with how complex it is to fix. 
---
And in saying that, why is this even an argument? Why are there so many bugs in the fucking first place?
---
Why do people have to settle for one because it’s all the engine can take? Consumers deserve much more than that.
---
Bethesda have professional whale hunters running their shops, they've put a lot of thought into the pricing, and their sums tell them these prices are thecsweet spot for maximum profit.
---
The only way to change it is for idiots to stop paying stupid money for virtually worthless cosmetic skins etc.
---
Been posted multiple times already.  Thx
---
they just need to GIVE the Scrapbox (in its current form) to EVERYONE.
---
Scrapbox is so awesome that no one should be paying for it. it should just be a thing everyone can access.
---
 Just found a “BOS Hood” at the Ranger Station in the Cranberry Bog. Couldn’t find it on your list, but may have missed it.
---
Thanks for being a great resource!
---
Don't forget the sliding ghouls. Lmao.
---
this, and display how many caps you have.
---
also, make it functional so we can us other players’s registers to review our sales, similar to how we can all use the Personal Terminal.
---
I hate it because it interrupts my music lol
---
and when you fast travel! sometimes the toast will never display, either.
---
Shit I would pay $13 for that much junk. Any idea if there is a way to force it to eat your scrap?
---
The point is at the time it was sold it was not classified as the same machine and 1 of each could be placed at a camp. They are even named differently, 1 is fog and 1 is smoke. That's what is shitty.
---
And your wrong about it causing problems. I have 2 activated at my camp and it doesn't effect my framerates at all
---
With latest patch - the modding seems to be dead. I've used recompressed textures and it was ok in adventure mode. Today it's not ok :( - the game exits as soon as you join the world due to having modified files.
---
Frequent AFKer here, *buuuuut* I always run solo and do my AFK runs as a pacifist, usually with a silly gimmick like placing 20 port-a-potties or photomode poses. If someone sees me I either run for it or die. *That's* proper AFK etiquette.
---
Heavy guns and energy weapons both got large buffs. 
---
Both 2 shot and explosive were nerfed, and tse is a good but no longer god tier combo of legendary effects.
---
I.. um.. my condolences?
---
Ofcourse not!
---
...
---
That would be for Fallout First+ members..
---
Right there with you, buy i think i can finally rest in peace with my latest creation. With Little Charleston City. Very original name i know, its just a place holder. Probably no one will guess where it is huhuhu.
---
Zenimax was created to be a parent company of Bethesda and handle the financial side of things. They aren't just a company that owns Bethesda, like EA with Bioware, they *are* Bethesda.
---
The fact that you've naively blamed Zenimax for shit Bethesda is doing means the corporate structure is doing its job.
---
Do you seriously not know what game breaking means?  The bugs in Skyrim that could freeze main quest progression and force you to revert to an old save were game breaking bugs.  The bugged save files for Fallout 3 corrupting over time just from use and causing the game to lag to a standstill were game breaking bugs.  Having to swap out a weapon to get back it's legendary effect?  Not a game breaking bug.
---
And how do you know that they're WILLINGLY ignoring anything?  Do you now why the fuck reloading a weapon would suddenly negate a legendary effect?  Maybe they have no fucking clue either and they're still trying to figure out how to fix it while not breaking anything else in the process.
---
Or.. pieces...
---
Yeah a friend of mine lost a be laser rifle like this...
---
Stop👏 supporting 👏shitty 👏 buisness
---
You now have to complete the full quest in order to get the key.
---
Avoid bubblehead stands and magazines. Had both of them full and after deleting them i was able to make a 2x2 building fully decorated with lights and stuff..
---
Have you even been around that long? 
---
I’ve been here since literally day ONE and the amount of GAME BREAKING bugs that were there stopped you from advancing the main quest very early on. A few months later there was a bug that caused some people’s consoles to completely brick. 
---
I’m not talking about legendary effects on weapons. I literally mean game. Breaking. 
---
There’s a whole history of game breaking 76 bugs. It took my partner 3 months to finish the main story (and we played for hours every day) because of a bug that just DIDNT let him progress at all. 
---
The recent history of Fallout 76 is not the whole history. Bethesda has been absolutely ignoring these bugs OR it takes them CLOSE TO A YEAR to finally patch out. 
---
Clearly you haven’t been around that long.
---
Ty for the info, i was about to buy the subscription for the atoms, ill wait then.
---
If they would implement some sort of anti-cheat, then most wouldn't need to hack. No excuse for AFKing in a team, though.
---
&gt; do the right thing and turn team fill off 
---
This is the idea, but most people's thinking is more like "that's three less people who could kill me early".
---
They can't check if a camp is there already how can they check for a nuke?
---
Oh yeah, I’ve got a lil 2x2 museum room that contain 2 displays. I like to use what I’ve got, but sheesh I can’t wait for a budget increase or optimization of certain items
---
Uhh maybe that is why so many people look for harder to detect pieces
---
They're literally the same item with a slightly different particle effect.
---
The argument you're making is literally like saying that you bought a lamp from  the atom shop and maxed out your placements for lighting and then bought a new ceiling light and want to know why you can't place any more.
---
Just because it doesn't effect YOU at YOUR camp doesn't mean shit.  Bethesda has to take into account the minimum specs this game can run at and the maximum load that can possibly put on a system in the worst case scenarios when they put limits on these things.  YOU may be perfectly fine at your camp but what happens to some poor schlub playing this game on a potato who has their camp in a high density area?  Fuck them?
---
Sone of us are depressed girls in their 20s
---
Yup, super scummy. But what do you expect?
---
Cool.  I wasn’t doubting you, I’m just confirming that it’s real.  It might motivate me to grind some raids to use that vault steel.
---
Did you try turning it off and then on again?
---
Man i would love some more budget, i reached i point where i believe i optimized as much as posible to make my city look lived in, but i get some ideas that i just cant justify like having a billboard with the name of the city with neon letters...
---
That's a good strat! Thank you for doing what you do with team fill off.
---
Yup, fixed it for a few hours then returned. No big deal, seems to be a little on and off. Dont used 3rd person much anyways
---
As someone who possesses a 40% faster swing speed Instigating power fist I concur with this statement!
---
Sounds like a you problem. But if it's hard to see a clear option here, maybe, don't set up shop in a place that is likly to be bombarded by nukes?
---
I have also been here since day one and can confidentally say anyone still defending this game in any aspect is just a fool. Bethesda doesn't even deserve the benefit of the doubt anymore, anyone still trying to excuse their behavior at this point is delusional.
---
This is a symptom of a ridiculous scoring system.  If kills meant more overseer xp, or teamwork, or something other than survival time, people would likely play more and afk or hide less.  I did 40 levels as mostly a solo bush wookie (tho my system on both maps usually means I get a chameleon serum 1/3 of the matches id say).  It is fun to move along like that in its own way, but grouping like that I feel is rude.
---
I don't think it has anything to do with cheating, the point is more to get the XP without putting in the work. They leave the game running while they're at work, out of the house, or otherwise AFK, and just have an autoclicker put them in matches.
---
remember when Bethesda said they had to limit storage space in stash boxes because of performance issues
---
Now we have something that basically allows unlimited storage
---
Get your head out of your ass and quit defending them.
---
The scout party thing is a good one / even just random npcs showing up and then running of after small dialogue would be a big draw for
---
Players in stalemate atm
---
Not anymore.
---
"Engine can't handle it" is a cope out 
---
Not only can the engine handle it fine but it's Bethesdas fault for using the same buggy engine instead of improving on it. There are no excuses at this point, it's still an item that was advertised and now it doesn't work as advertised.
---
At this point Bethesda treats you like the product
---
It sounds like a problem I get when I’m just loading a big area like the inside of Wsprings. It will load my guy at the entry, let me walk around for 20seconds without being able to interact with anything, or oddly enough see myself in 3rd person view. I am then teleported back to the entrance once its actually loaded like a big “haha Fu game not ready yet bro”.    
---
    
---
Besides that I haven’t encountered your problem. If it’s related its probs either your internet connection/the server is missing on loading material, or you have found another BGS bug and are now an involuntary BETA tester.(Vault-tec would like to congratulate you).
---
Is it lvl 50?
---
Well they don’t have live characters, that’s the best they got
---
&gt; Heavy guns and energy weapons both got large buffs.
---
Again? Because last time that happened, energy weapons were still garbage.
---
Christ your account is way too empty to believe any of what you said
---
I’ve had it happen 3 times that the minute I logged my camp got vaporized. No warning, just BOOM!
---
Ha, I get that problem too. I've got relatively high end internet, and even then it should load in with enough time. So I dont think it's related. Probably some minor thing with the most recent update. Not too worried
---
Thank god I am glad its not permanent.
---
Because you don't understand how item storage fucking works.
---
There's a HUGE difference between having unlimited storage for scrap and having unlimited stash space.  There's only thirty three pieces of broken down scrap.  That means that the total number of entries needed to keep track of your scrap box is just thirty three, consisting of the item id for the type of scrap and the value for now many you have.  If your stash had unlimited space it would need to be able to retrieve values for EVERY SINGLE ITEM in the game.  Every single piece of scrap, junk, ingredient, ammo, meal, chem and every possible combination of weapon and armor with unique levels, mods and legendary effects.
---
So how about YOU get YOUR head out of your ass and stop pretending you know shit about how this game works.
---
The sound. The screen was ugly, and the music wasn’t even music. Tell me what you preferred and why
---
Maybe try a different list? I've got a handful going and it let me sign in fine (I turned it on just to test, this is the second post I've seen regarding this). 
---
I use sResourceIndexFileList and I've renamed the mods to shorten the total character amount
---
yes please (for free btw)
---
I wonder what the lv 800+ on Xbox does to stay interested.
---
Great reminder. It’s scary how easy it is to do in the heat of battle. It would be nice to be able to lock certain items into never being dropped/sold/scripped.
---
Damn, that seems like such an easy way to destroy things too. My original thought was during a fight because I’ve dropped some non-favorited non-painted items before during a fight
---
Bethesda, we hate the dry content and 10000 atomic shop power armour skins. Please. Take notes, heck hire this guy. We loved the trailer with country roads, and we all know this would be amazing. Bethesda, if u see this, all I want is this in game
---
[“This deal is getting worse all the time!” -Players](https://youtu.be/WpE_xMRiCLE)
---
Get it through your head that your comment history in this sub is completely pathetic and saddening that you actually think this game is worth defending 
---
You are a fool who will never learn
---
I bought it.  🤭
---
A lot of my friends aren’t playing anymore. They’re just bored and disappointed with the lack of meaningful new content. The devs need to be more pro active by adding little surprises each update to create more hype for wastelanders and the game in general.
---
Or perhaps, just perhaps, like a normal consumer he assumed they made the limit at 1 so in the event bethesda released more (Which they had clearly already planned) they could both be placed. 
---
Nothing suggested oversight at all.
---
It destroys weapons when you drop them?
---
Because only the cool cool kids buy 18 dollar power armor.
---
Can we still ask for a refund?
---
Oh look, the company that spits on its customers all the time is acting shady again! If only we had some kind of previous drama that would have clues us into the fact Bethesda doesn’t care about customers as long as they are paying.
---
I didn’t want to have to do this, but I’ll test to it be 100% certain; give me a sec.
---
For some reason the new update feels refined to me is it just me or has anyone noticed? I’m probably high asf but I swear I can tell a difference it does t lag as much and it runs more smoothly on my ps4 atleast
---
The turkey hasn't come out yet, believe you saw a preview
---
I honestly didn't mind either of them. The original was very fitting for our early days of coming out of the vault into a new world. After nuking so much and killing eachother the NW one was very intimidating but I felt it was fitting for the Battle Royale theme. I don't really need any particular type of music or anything for a part of the game I am in for maybe a minute or two tops. But they're both catchy and cool in their own way. I thought the NW one wasn't as colorful, which I presume is what you meant by ugly, scenes of everything burning can get old. But I think it summed up the destructive nature of humans, both what they did to this world and what they are now doing to eachother in game. I was really surprised at the dislike for the NW one, though and nobody really explained why until now. Ive asked several times on other posts and usually just got downvoted with no explanations. So thanks for responding :)
---
I'm like 90% sure I was at the camp where and when you got the blade. You play PC?
---
Yep. Traded a FE LMG for it
---
This actually made me quit the game. Goodbye Bloody, Explosive, Faster Fire Rate Lever Action. You were a good friend.
---
They were sold as two different named items that could be placed at a camp at the same time. Now they changed it so only one can be placed. That is the shitty part, regardless of whatever excuse you want to make
---
Dang, they have the tools to just make whatever the fuck and put it in your inventory, whoda thought
---
haha
---
its a bug thats been around a long long time... Put your regularly used stuff on favorites wheel, everything else is just a gamble, my friend
---
That's either your controller or a really fucking stupid problem. Lol.
---
[here you go](https://m.imgur.com/a/3ZhkLJl):)
---
Did Bethesda fix this bug though, how do you stop players running scripts within cheat engine (considering all they are looking for is whether or not cheat engine is running, and even doing so in a way that can easily be bypassed)? It's a shame if these people got banned if they didn't exploit it (dozens or hundreds of times). Their account history would show what they actually did. Every time you pick up or are given a weapon, or drop a weapon, it would be logged.
---
Thank you.
---
*bethesda rep jotting down furiously*
---
&gt;ist in game items and atom shop and let's see which wins
---
Ya, but that's not what you said before, right? All of the most valuable,  most desired items are not available in the atom shop,  like all of the BOS paints, the rare nuka-cola paints, long hunter coat, etc. There are a lot of in game only items and the funny part is people complain that they are not available for atoms because they don't want to do the events and hunts for all of them.
---
An entire year, nearly.
---
Sometimes armor is weight heavy so you list it to reduce your stash weight. Sometimes you just wanna get rid of it. Caps are not worth much.
---
What 18 dollar power armor?  
---
I haven't bothered to log in since before Halloween.
---
Don't buy it? They would not be priced this way if they didn't sell. Seems like every time a flashy and expensive skin drops everyone has it. We can clearly see what became of the fridge/scrapotron boycott did. Freaking everyone and their brother has one. If you want them to lower the price people need to stop buying them at the higher price.
---
Can't you stack a bunch of food bonuses?
---
B.E.T.A. age bug :(   
---
Rare, but it does happen
---
I'm sure there's a lot of ways around it, but I would think if this is exploitable by memory that means the transaction itself is happening locally on your computer, thus it's open to memory injectors changing variables.  Keep in mind there's a giant ton of memory and the "cheat engine" is looking at individual blocks of memory at a time, it's literally a needle in a haystack kind of thing to find the specific code in the specific block of memory that would alter the interaction.  That's the "hundreds of times" they're talking about.  He basically just started looking at memory blocks and changing variables to see if they could recreate the exploit they were told about.  If you counted every change done every time they did it and they made a dozen changes on an attempt, I'm sure it could add up to "hundreds" in practically no time, but it's kind of a silly way of even quantifying it.  
---
If they found it, then they could just go to Bethesda and say look here, in this block you can change these settings, and the purveyor will offer you legendary items for caps instead of legendary scrip.  It's not like Bethesda has a good track record of fixing game-breaking bugs.  They probably would ignored it entirely if someone said "oh you can cheat to get legendaries for caps from the purveyor."  That isn't helpful at all and only a software company staffed by complete idiots would ban people for reporting issues they tried to reproduce first instead of just submitting garbage feedback like that.
---
Nice thanks! It should be on there but I don't know if I have that location listed.
---
The coffin backpack is great. It’s small and black. So it matches nearly everything. 
---
You should get it if they bring it back.
---
I'm getting really fucking tired of having to explain that the explicit reason my post history is almost exclusively to this sub is EXACTLY BECAUSE OF CREEPS LIKE YOU who I don't need going through every post I've ever made to every sub to make personal attacks.  It's called using multiple accounts jackass.  Enjoy getting reported for harassment.
---
EVERYONE IMMEDIATELY UPVOTE ANY AND ALL POSTS THAT ARE TOWARDS BETHESDA REGARDING ANY BELOW AVERAGE EXPERIENCE THAT SOMEONE IS TALKING ABOUT. NOTHING WILL CHANGE WITHOUT PUBLIC PRESSURE. EXAMPLE - SONIC MOVIE.
---
I don't understand what you're saying here, are you trying to say that Bethesda has done things in the past like ignore/cancel right away customers tickets, or endorse shitty (autocorreted from shotty, I regret nothing, autocorret knows what's up) products like nuka rum, or tried to comp 80 USD with 500 atoms, or promises nothing but skins and the like for sale but turn around and sell repair kits and private server access with armors that would indicate something like what you are trying to imply?
---
How the fuck did you pull that reasoning out of your ass?  The limit is one so OBVIOUSLY they want you to be able to place more than that?  Jesus Christ.
---
It really does! Looks like I’ll need to get myself that for the shine and another for all the different nukas
---
I've been playing almost 900 hours and have plenty of good pvp gear, but that's the problem. I feel like if I don't use it I'm wasting it and when I do use it I wonder if I only did better because I had better legendary drops than the other guy. It takes the fun out of it. I don't bother with pvp much anymore unless someone is pissing me off.
---
I get that it's an RPG but the legendary effects are just a bit much. The build variety from perks and loadout are plenty of variety I think, and attainable by anyone just by leveling up. Legendary effects just needlessly make RNG a factor in PVP success. The only way around being lucky is trading for the best gear, and then you either have to be lucky and find someone selling it or go outside the game to trade. When people feel like they need to go outside the game to get better gear so they do better... that seems broken.
---
Haha.. no
---
It’s sad but there is no chance.
---
Pretty easy to notice tho if u paying attention i specifically  think about it when scriping or dropping weapons. I never want it happen so i read it twice lol but very easy thing to do. I think favoriting items should stay favorited even in stashs so u never have to re favorite things so then that message will always pop up
---
That is very unfortunate...
---
Likewise.  PS4.  Sat there looking at the main menu thinking I was going crazy like, hang on where do I select my character in this game? I'm SURE it was here...!!
---
18 is nothing for  a skin nowadays stop complaining
---
This. I want those metal shelves to hold things so badly.
---
Lmao no.
---
Of course they were sold as separately named items because they are separate items... that doesn't negate the fact that they're both in the same exact fucking category that has a placement restriction.  Again every single light in the game has a different name but that doesn't mean you get to max out placing one of them and then start placing more of another.
---
The new machine was never advertised as being placeable beyond the limit of the original, people just figured it out on their own after buying it and assumed it was supposed to work that way... and they supposed wrong.
---
Luckily I haven’t happen to me yet, but as you can see it has happened to others.
---
The point is that there’s a system in place that is prone to errors which lead to permanent consequences in game, and this could and should easily be fixed by not allowing people do destroy their painted object.
---
Maybe that is it. Thanks for setting me straight. LOL. Still, I stand by what I say. Take our family for example, there are 4 of us that play. Two kiddos, the hubby, and me. Of course, I like to collect outfits, furniture, stuffies, and wallpapers. Everyone else likes gun and power armor skins. The hubs works and his job pays once a month. I make the budget a month in advance. So, if the kids want the newest power armor skin, we have to hope I got an Etsy sale that will cover it or that there is extra in the budget. Often we miss out on those sales because there is only a few days or because it is just way too much for us all to get it.
---
dont worry you'll be able to purchase it in the shop next week.
---
How about a raider or free states one if you have some 30-35 dollars to spend?
---
I seen some, I had one as well. I did spend a pretty penny too lol love it nonetheless
---
No problem!
---
Yeah I'd understand if it was a VE gatling plasma got 18 dollars but power armor...
---
Nuclear Winter Battle Royale is here
---
yes I play on pc.  servers always have peeps on em.
---
Yes the Eastasian dogs will perish! ... We will drive back the Eurasians!
---
Thats exactly wat im saying, i agree with the OP i just saying how i deal with it since its not fixed
---
Ballistic damage and armor is a reduction of damage based on a certain percentage and a bit of armor. 
---
A 150 damage weapon isn’t required to do the maximum damage to a target. 
---
At this current moment, 3 is the minimum amount of shots required to kill. 
---
If you hit a shot on target, damage will always be dealt, unless invulnerability has been achieved (Possible in many ways, all of them exploits) 
---
Ballistic resistance isn’t additive. If you have 206 total armor (Sadly quite low, you will need to increase this), I’m more than willing to bet that ~130 damage will be dealt to you
---
Armor penetration is a serious thing in this game. It makes the damage reduced by armor much less. This is how I can keep a 90 damage weapon viable in PVP.
---
Yeah, personally I removed the paint from my weapons till they fix it because it seems easy to avoid scripping them, and dropping them is not as bad as destroying them completely 😂
---
But the scrap box is more movement towards game affecting things.
---
That’s only because the perk is... Jank.
---
It doesn’t proc a whole lot, and I’ve really only been able to test with it in controlled situations. It has the potential to become powerful to help, but I don’t see much use for it in anything me or my friend use. I just like to take all sides and defend arguments based on my data. If you were looking for application and in game data, my friend, u/Scorpion278 would be glad to answer any questions you have.
---
Yeah the ghouls came to mind. The sound of them dying was next level
---
Excuse after excuse out of you and you are wrong. If it was the same item it would have shown up in the camp menu under the same tab, it didn't. It also wasn't advertised as the same item. One is a fog machine and one is a smoke machine, 2 different items
---
Good question, untill I saw not one, not two but THREE award speech edits and had to downvote.
---
Ask for a refund!
---
I had only 3 PVP encounters since launch, 2 at the very start. The one where the dude killed me for the workshop happened just after they took survival away. I thought he was a hacker or something, only found out later pvp is enabled at workshops. This game has one of the nicest communities of any game I've ever played, hope that not changing.
---
And here I was earlier with 8 other people getting nowhere against the SBQ because the person who dropped the nuke didn’t place it right to fight her outside of the zone :(
---
So I was in a hazmat suit (in hindsight I should have worn power armour...but in my defence I NEVER wear it and didn’t even think about it) without my unyielding armour and AP bonuses with my bloody pistol build that relies heavily on both to stay alive lol.
---
...I shouldn’t be the one doing the most damage to the queen AND doing the most mob control but my bloody six shooter and black powder pistols were doing it.
---
People kept Dying too fast to focus on the Queen enough.
---
...at least I got some legendaries from mobs I killed I guess :(
---
Tl;dr; I’m jealous and wish my pistol build could do the same (I knew it couldn’t when I started it though).
---
Main buff they got recently allows them to work with perks like tank killer and stabilized so they peirce er.
---
This was a rather major buff, though they are still not exactly alpha outside of legacy weapons.
---
Typical; the only bugs that get fixed are the ones that made the game more enjoyable :/
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. No.
---
It doesn't even have a nomination. It'll likely go to Fortnite (again) although FF or Apex *may* have a chance this year.
---
I haven't played in over 6 months nor kept up to date with it... assuming by this post it's still horrible?
---
You’re wrong though?
---
Cool
---
Excuse after excuse after fucking excuse.  Are floor lights and ceiling lights under different tabs in the menu?  Do they still share the same mother fucking placement limit?  Stop trying to split fucking hairs.  These are the EXACT same objects with minor changes to color.  Trying to argue that one is a *SMOKE* machine while the other is a *FOG* machine so they're *OBVIOUSLY TOTALLY DIFFERENT* makes you look like a dumbass.
---
Been in the game since they started dropping from the queen.
---
I’m being stalked by a government drop crate everywhere i go :(
---
Now it’s inside my house and I’m scared to go to sleep
---
Yeah an invisible backpack is a no brainer. Hopefully they add it.
---
Why tho? Fo76 has a great communtiy
---
There's a bug tho, if you craft Bufftats it counts as crafting Buffout, Mentats and Bufftats.
---
Dude you have issues
---
There’s this one from a while back. Not mine but well put together. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dd3vwf/my_brotherhood_of_steel_alternate_characters/?st=K38DA4VP&amp;sh=f7dbac3a
---
This has been a "thing" since they added the ultracite jetpacks to the game
---
Reddit/r/fo76 is the restroom.
---
I don’t think it has FPS issues. I’ve been right in front of smoke machines and maintained a solid 60 at max settings, and while my pc is good it isn’t out of this world or anything. A 1060 and i5 should have no problem and that’s an entry level setup so anything below that is bound to have issues in most modern games.
---
If you want to see FPS issues check out how DayZ was at launch. That was just disgusting.
---
Were you in third person? I noticed my vats accuracy will drop to zero if I switch from first person. It is like the max range is based on the camera, not character.
---
I was always first person
---
Yup. quad explosive is awesome. Add the flechette mod and you have an OP pump explosive shotgun. Had a *** Instigating harpoon drop tried it out... garbage. 
---
Breaks fast though. I can clean out West Tek twice and then have to repair to 200%.
---
This is the only weapon that I never have to make ammo for. Made 400 rounds initially,  and today I realized I had over 2k rounds. I realized that you get nearly 4 harpoons back for every harpoon you shoot. Wish that would happen with my Handmades!
---
I find it funny that you have spy in your username, because I was just complaining in my head about Bethesda still not fixing speed demon to work with class freak.
---
I just carry some inert flux on me all the time.
---
May the lord open
---
Most of the time, the enemies fall immediately with my automatic rifle. Those that can't be felled immediately are high-leveled ones with attack damage that I can't tank. So I have not much choice but to move most of the time.
---
This is what I usually do but there are days that I haven't been on nuked zones and both are quite heavy  when you have bunch of them.
---
Yeah, I usually use the extra flux I get from nuked zones but I haven't visited one for few days now.
---
I carry maybe 30-50 purified water, but I think I have an aid weight reduction perk on all  my characters. I also run unyielding on one and heavy back packs on all. Helps with the carry weight
---
Can't see your comments DM me?
---
I carry around 100 purified water and I have that perk too but have to remove it later.
---
It's kinda neat seeing people using usernames they had many years ago. But yeah, they messed up with the coding I think. Since speed demon shows +15% hunger and thirst instead of -15%, it's not seen as a negative effect.
---
Yeah I just came back to the game recently and it has been a small mess. I play on a ps4 slim with amazing internet and I kept getting disconnected from public matches, using pharma farma would take up to 10+ seconds to ding so I already walked away thinking it was empty. 
---
Also when I would die before there would be a misc objective to retrieve my loot. This doesn't happen anymore for me and I have to look on map for my death spot every time .
---
some off them do, at least the ones that really count, like calibrates socks, etc.
---
also a quick google search would had tell you what your looking for instead than having someone here tell you. 
---
look the first search that comes up.

Yup on for armor. Armor breaks 50% slower than normal, is what I believe the perk says
---
Amen, i have a Be laser rifle that breaks in about 30 seconds if i use it nonstop

That is exactly what I was referring to! So powerful. So fragile.

This was exactly what I was wondering about, seems I shall buy now. Was going to be angry if it only displayed 2 things like in the picture.. just seemed like a Bethesda thing to do so didn’t buy it yet ... glad it holds six then.
---
You can’t!  It’s what 570/580 atoms for completing all of the weeks challenges.   Let me know when they start giving out 1800 atoms for the challenges.
---
Where does one start the questline?
---
Beer.
---
No way! When i saw in the patch notes they had moved it in the camp build menu, i assumed that it was more for ease of finding it (not that it was that hard anyway). I have seen 4 crate drops spewing more smoke in 1 area, than these smoke machines do. Up to their old tricks again it seems.
---
It probably set their servers on fire.
---
Shadowed Liberty Prime, just another reskin
---
It’s an unmarked quest, like the other keys, so you won’t get quest markers.
---
Getting the rusted key that’s in the underwater safe where you also get the Alien Blaster is the first step.
---
Big oof. Bethesda had small fuck ups all the way back in Oblivion but people let it go because the games were fun and full of content. BioWare was the best singleplayer dev at one point, but EA fucked them up. Blizzard takes it in the ass from China and Activision is shit.
---
 Use descriptive titles when submitting a post. If the average user has  to click on your post to understand the context, then it is not  descriptive enough. If you're posting a question, put it in the title  and give further information inside. Avoid the use of ellipses.  Rule no. 6, bitch!

Was Nuclear Winter really six months ago? Also some people like the vault raids. Not one of them personally but a few people are taken aback when I tell them I don't do them
---
Try using vats lol
---
YES.  I go out of my way to skirt Thunder Mountain because I can’t bear to hear Squire Rosen one more time.
---
The same goes for the damned First Friends Church in Charleston.  I stopped caring about swarming vermin in October 2018.
---
They need more West Tek and Harper's Ferry type locations on the map.  They had a bunch of places before that were great for legendary farming (Wendigo Cave, Watoga, etc.) and had challenging enemies.  They nerfed them all into oblivion. WHY?!
---
I have a question for y’all... what made you want to spend 100 dollars a year for something everyone should be getting for free?
---
Woah, that's a beautiful weapon. It's all about the speed! Although I'm instigating acquired a 40% swing speed vampire combat knife recently. That is THE fastest weapon. I was mobbed by glowing ghouls at the door of the golf club last night for a looong time and because of the vampire effect and how fast that weapon is my health didn't drop once. I didn't even have gladiator equipped. It's great for tagging without one-shotting everything.
---
Pretty sure there are accounts being sold on ebay right now.
---
I have 3 purifiers on my camp and i always have waaaaaaayyyyy too much water on me. Have to keep selling/dropping it.
---
Pvp getting interrupted at Whitespring Station because of Uranium Fever is annoying. I support your idea.
---
I bought my mule account for 8 euros couple months ago in G2A but the prices seem to have gone up since. Looks like it's between 14-15e now.
---
you can't have explosive and FFR on one weapon, they both share major affix slot...
---
Good idea! 
---
Personally just switch between t-51 melee/tank, T-60 steatlh sniper, or x-01 with jetpack and heavy guns... Ultracite has been in stash since probably December when first got it if anybody wants it on ps4 it's free 😂 (jetpack only on chest)
---
Well anecdotally I'm on a slim with the best class of internet and the game has been playing like ass. From pharma farma taking literally 5+ seconds to register,opening pip boy sinks me to 5 fps.. Constant lag and shots taking seconds to register. Yesterday the frames were so bad Id get hit with like 5-6 seconds of delayed damage and be killed instantly. 
---
Not to be rude what does saying you haven't had any problems hope to accomplish?
---
I use nothing but my x Armor with the ultracite arms haha
---
I do not have said FO1st but i would reckon it is the same date you are billed / get your FO1st renewed every month
---
Once per 30 day payment cycle? If you bought monthly, you should get them whenever you're charged for the next payment. Not sure for yearly.
---
Quit that game already 😂😂
---
Now we just need a Nukashine fermenter.
---
Yesterday’s most difficult was kill ten fireflies.  There’s an unmarked location north of Aaronholt Farm with eight fireflies. One server hop and mission complete.
---
I’m thinking you either don’t actually play the game or haven’t checked Atom challenges in months, because they haven’t given us outrageous ones in a while.  Apparently they read the complaints over the summer and adjusted.
---
I agree that 1800 atoms is a ridiculous price for a single skin, and an annoyingly talkative one at that.  I’m guessing they’re testing the limits of player spending.  I almost always wait for items to go on sale, anyways.
---
Hardened receiver for the SA too, please
---
You know what would really teach those greedy mofos something. Don’t buy anything from the atom shop, I only bought the junk robot and I’m sitting on 10,000 atoms.....
---
The game doesn’t work the same way the promised, but they won’t refund that...
---
I start every session making 85-100 soups. I go to Silvia farm and use green thumb to pick razor grain. Like 150. Then I go across the road to the river. There is a campsite there with a fire. Gather like 150 water. equip Super Duper. Now turn around and boil it all, then make your soups. Use the left over water to brew or just discard it. if you have at least level 1 in Salty perk ( can't remember the name it keeps food from spoiling) This will last you hours.. like I've played 5-6 hours and never had to make anymore food or drink anymore water. It makes inventory management so care-free . You just add the razor grain soup to your hot wheel left or right and mash the d pad when your thirsty or hungry. Unless I'm making certain recipes like sunshine oil, or venison berries. I don't like to be bothered with food or drink. So this is my method. good luck out there
---
Wait, let me guess.  A bit bored were you?
---
No, I just had two of them
---
Do you still get x4 ore?
---
Sorry I use the x-10 not the miner one
---
👍 Cheers
---
I'd like to see this happen also, but I doubt it will. I imagine NW will eventually get linked to adventure mode anyway.
---
I do not see purified water as something to drink but a regent used to make pots: rad x, rad away, stimps diluted. Drinking it feels so wasteful that If I'm thirsty and put of soups I'll go boil water or drink booze and leave it in my stash.
---
Been there. Wasted most of my 20s. Hope you find a way forward.
---
Yeah, some psychological horro meta type shit
---
I don't have this problem. things I will not drop destroy or sell I rename with : ***__( Item name)**
---
this way they are always at the top of my list. so I will be cautious and not spam click buttons. Also, weapons with paints have atoms near them. I dunno works for me.
---
the exp they give was farmed during a double exp event with an exploit. so they changed it to 1. there's videos about this on YouTube. thank the dupers for ruining it.

i am having the same problem, only when turning left on PS4.
---
it is like the speed you turn when aiming a weapon.
---
in any situation, any gear, tested it with several controllers, rebuild ps4 database jadajadajada...
---
it is not consistently so for a few minutes it works just fine, then turning left is slow again.
---
and on some servers it does not happen at all. 
---
most annoying bug yet.
---
USA and I wasn't talking about a game refund I'm talk no about a broken atomic item
---
use the camp perk that reduces hunger or Thirst while playing
---
Ah, I was talking about the game. Cheers!
---
Are you going to give them more money after this?
---
Savage. I can only find them at level 20 somethin
---
Never had it happen to me. So it “works” for me too, but it’s clear to see how the way this system is leaves it open to error.  As opposed to not being able to drop/destroy painted weapons.
---
The second I saw “are you sure you want this destroyed”? i took the paint off my gun.  My weapons being 2 missclicks away from being destroyed is not cool with me
---
My total? Im on like 3.5k atm. Its a decent amount if you get small buys like this, but I wouldn't buy bundles for like 1.5k as it would drain my resources.
---
I used a lot of soups and drinks for the buffs so every time I buff up I satisfy my thirst and hunger meter.
---
It does require a little time crafting but the perks you get from the food buffs are well worth it.
---
Like I feel it's almost mandatory to have cranberry and blackberry juice
---
I honestly though that's what the point of that was. I guess if Wastelanders released when intended, the scorched event would've led into that.
---
***Citation needed***
---
I just received the email about being charged for my subscription but haven't received any atoms credited to my account yet.
---
Is that on YouTube
---
And not just patching exploits, but gaps in the geometry where you could get stuck accidently.
---
They mean it when they say Nuclear Winter is in beta. I'm sure you're right that they're testing each map one-by-one right now. Fairly similar to the testing servers I'm Fortnite, etc.
---
We need more Dunwich.
---
I found a church with drinking glasses next to all the skeletons, mass suicide?
---
Found a couple of skeletons with a picnic laid out in front of them and a live dog sitting by their side. Nice loyal dog. But if they died when the bombs fell the dog would also be dead. I think they went for a last picnic, and well their dog ate the their bone clean.
---
Entrepreneurship :)
---
- actually useful for cooking soups
---
Thanks for the insight! I’ll be sure to take this boundless wisdom and passive-aggressive condescension to heart. 
---
I deliberately built my CAMP south enough so it usually *isn’t* within the ring, and I’ve had luck with it until now. I’ve also seen other CAMPs spawn into nuked zones post-touchdown and become immediately destroyed. Should we expect anything less from the game? Not really. But it’s still an idea to consider going forward.
---
meh
---
18 dollars  the power armour !!!
---
WooooOooo, YeeeeeAAaaaaahhh.
---
This works 
---
I run with the rejuvenated perk.  Being well fed and hydrated is important to keep the bonuses.
---
I do the same.  Craft 20-40 soups and link it to a fast use button.  Except I craft brain fungus soups (which give +2 INT which provides +4-5% XP bonus) and/or corn soup (for AP bonus)
---
i feel like you have a lot of bunched up aggro man. i’m not out here trying to start stuff. can assure you now Alchemical isn’t on some witch-hunt.
---
Yeah, that's kind of the point he making. A one of payer (buying the game) gets very poor support (if any), a repeat payer (fo1st) gets shiny AF support.  
---
How much do we have to pay to get our regular bugs fixed?
---
&gt; Fallout 4 could have accommodated it just by letting you have a Co-Op Game where both parents lived and went looking for their kid together.
---
That's such a good idea.
---
Yup, you can ask for a refund lifetime as long as the item changed without warning.
---
Yup. All 7 melee foods stack (yao goai ribs and roast, mutant hound steak and stew, mutton chops and meat pie, and glowing meat steak, then deathclaw wellington for the 3 str.
---
Purple
---
I have 5000 atoms, I already put a little effort into it. The point is the same.
---
Don't get me wrong, It has been awesome to have human company since the scorched beasts assimilated all my raider buddys into the hive mind, but I didn't see any more nukes start dropping until you vault dwellers came out of your fancy hidy-holes and start waging another war on a dilapidated world.
---
Think about it on a large RP level. Your CAMP never moved, even when you logged off to avoid catastrophy. To me this isn't a bug, rather more immersion.
---
Well most of us know the servers are fragile, lol
---
A cheater? There is no way you can have all those items in their stash.
---
Because they didn't even think about it when they put the options. A brainbot would have done better.
---
don't give them ideas.
---
They would work if balanced NW.
---
Wow! I didn’t know vampire weapons could be so viable. I’ve  actually got a vampires 40% more power attack damage sheepsquatch club I might take out for a spin.
---
Many can't seem to make that distinction, Bethesda is not fallout 76. I hate them for going back on their promise of only cosmetics will be paid for. But I still like the game with it's bugs and all.
---
The reason this deal is so bad is because some already got the regular + american paint liberty prime for 1800 atoms, and now you get another reskin for a skin you already paid for
---
I only paid for a month and cancelled my subscription. Of course they didn't care for me
---
My man; you are going to be maxed out on legendary perks *when Wastelanders drops*! I'm so jealous of you right now. IRL stuff got in the way of me playing 76 as much as I'd like and now I'm going to try to get all 4 of my alts to 50 for 1 card a piece and 3 from my main so I can have a full set. I don't think there's any way for me to get to 350 on my main before Wastelanders drops.
---
Congrats on 400!
---
They've said they're not adding any content other than the already planned seasonal events until Wastelanders drops. All of the patches until as late as April May be just bug fixes and ATX items. My brother took a hiatus until then because he's not the type to be able to mindlessly build C A.M.P.s several times a week like I am. He **needs** new content to be able to hold his interest.
---
It sounds like you're probably in the same boat and it may be better to just wait for Wastelanders if you've already accumulated 350 levels between your characters.
---
Great, expecting a 2021 fix now.
---
Fix is coming in 2021!
---
I think it's the sheer speed of it that makes it so good: a FAST weapon together with maxed Martial Artist and 40% swing speed = stabby blur. Vampire seems decent if your weapon can hit fast enough to keep topping up the health meter. I couldn't believe how well it worked at Whitesprings. It took much longer to kill the pack of ghouls than with my instigating weapons, but what impressed me was that I could stand in the midst of them all for a,long time without any detriment to my health. I felt almost invincible! :-)
---
The more people fight her, the higher her health is, it caps out at 16 people. So her health is obviously much lower on private servers.
---
My favourite thing is how it says something like "you know how to rebuild this". Um no if I could craft legendaries there would be something wrong.
---
Also shout out to favouriting the items to stop them being dropped. My favourite wheel is just full of all my gear and useless for it's intended function, but at least my legendary gear isn't quietly disappearing now...
---
Check under Stored in the build menu to make sure that you don't have any Stored blueprints, which includes the budget for all of the components of the Blueprint.  Anything under Stored takes up CAMP budget.
---
Don't get confused with the Blueprints menu, which are basically just templates.  The items under Blueprints do not take up CAMP budget.   Just the stuff under Stored.
---
There are lots of Youtube videos on building.   I haven't seen that many, most of my knowledge is from experience.  However, I did look at a couple because of your question and I learned a couple of new techniques.  So I'll have to check them out more...
---
What’s the problem?
---
933.75 weight just boiled waters...
---
thanks for the downvote guys. this was just a question. and they did NOT restored scrap at this time like you can see from the ticket responses from the last night.
---
But they will now :) so problem solved. wont ask anything again since you only get answers from trolls.
---
they are starting to give the stuff back now. so nobody got his or her scrap restored. thank you for trolling...
---
According to the data miners, the SBQ does NOT scale with the number of players.
---
Also, the optional quest objective for I Am Become Death is "Nuke Fissure Site Prime (8+ Players Recommended)", so I'd say that the number of people on private servers is limited to 8 precisely because that's what the intended number of people for an SBQ fight is, according to the devs.
---
I hot keyed purified water.
---
Also I have 7 or 8 water purifiers, only 1 is locked. If you ever wonder by my camp just help yourself.
---
Why did you take my fog away? 😯
---
Might depend on when you subscribed. Looks like the people getting the email subscribed before the hotfix
---
But no exact like you said. Also, that's if you buy the year. And that's if you are in the US. If you buy monthly, or live outside the US, or want more atoms on top of the 1650, you have to pay more
---
Enjoy your ammo. Sorry it was only 700ish rounds.
---
You are probably right, it's just what I've been told and I've noticed that if it's just me and 4-5 others we can have her down within 5-10 minutes but if 15 people she becomes a bullet sponge and sometimes doesn't die.
---
I really like fallout 76, so much so that I got 2 others to buy it and play with me. But bethsda/zenimax not so much anymore. Maybe they lied about the atoms just like they lied about " 
---
* There will be microtransactions, but Bethesda assures players that they will only be for cosmetic elements.
---
* *Fallout 76* will have free updates ... "
---
r/awardspeechedits
---
Don’t know why you’re getting downvoted has the sub really become a circle jerk
---
Yet it was harmless and people enjoyed it. Similar to Feed the People giving the entire server some soup. Bethesda only ever really fixes the harmless bugs they can do quickly just so they can pad out patch notes. They rarely fix anything that affects gameplay in a meaningful way...
---
How about not supporting scummy monetization practices?
---
It took me about 3 months to get them all. Doing it 5/6 times a day, it is a heck of a grind but worth it in the end I think. If you want multiples don't learn the plan as you never get it again once you've learned it.
---
If you cant win the game, even without your team members your just a bad shot. What are you usually doing if your team members are already dead, just giving up? I never had a problem and usually ignoring my team and always ended up in a good position lol
---
i just started a new toon for nw. the rewards are accountwide anyway.
---
this way you can level a toon, too.
---
Or you can just sell it through your vending machine.
---
Yeah, why the fuck not? And it does have subscription fee. What are you talking about?
---
Yeah and those are just as bad. So?
---
Like Fisto?
---
Ive got 3 workshops on a personal world and this has been happening ALL day, today. Eh, hope it gets fixed.. I just store and replace and then move on.
---
Maybe you’d find out why he cafes if you uses your brain.
---
I've been having a feeling that wastlanders will be paid content.
---
I don’t know, maybe because shit like this needs to be called out and removed from our games?
---
Yes they’re customer support is terrible
---
So.. uhh where is this update that wasn’t free? I’ve never paid for any updates
---
Blackwater mine is your friend
---
Kill moleminers sell their shit
---
Profit daily
---
You need to have unlocked the actual backpack plan through the scouts quest before you can add the skins you've bought. Have you done this already?
---
Also, caps are really pretty easy to get if you clear out areas suitable to your level and sell everything you can pick up to a vendor. If you also sell excess items at one of your vending machines you can make lots of caps if priced reasonably
---
One of the nicest in game communities of any game I've played.
---
1&amp;2) we do not need more caps. Spend hours more wisely. Soon you will he swimming in camps. We don’t need to devalue the currency anymore than it already is. 
---
3) not a glitch. Description clearly says you need plan for standard backpack to craft. Complete order of the tadpole. Read the posters in any train station to get started.
---
Thanks you i will drop scorpion a message.
---
The reason i picked non legendary was to avoid the issue of the effects of the weapon or armour affecting the “test”.
---
My armour does about 490/570 and I’m still squishy.....
---
100% agreed
---
Fortunately for me, I love getting involved in SBQ fights. Every time I see one I grab my Anti armour explosive gattling and get stuck in :-) One of the perks with that is the improved repair kits that drop. I have over 100 of them and can't remember the last time I repaired something at a work bench lol.
---
Know you know how the collectron buyers felt when Bethesda nerfed then two weeks after coming out
---
I lost a few hundred yellow flux but luckily didn't put my vault steel in. If this is true I 100% would count this as coming out ahead.
---
It seems to be something that happens from time to time. Their response is give it 3 days provide proof of purchase and they will credit the atoms.
---
Because there is difference between real items and digital ones? That TV costs some materials, it had to be shipped there, etc. That’s not the case with skins. You design the skin and that’s it. It doesn’t cost you anything to produce million skins. It literally has the value that they attribute to it based on nothing.
---
New reloading gun bug. If you switch weapons fast or tap the button more then once. It will empty your guns ammo.
---
saw a bar yesterday on PS4 using these shelves, it was really good-looking and apparently the owner was proud of it. I gave him the heart emote and the 5 different beers I was carrying since he only displayed nuka colas!
---
We could, but then by theory, almost everywhere we get anything from, we would need to boycott. If we don't have the money we simply won't buy. I am merely stating that Bethesda needs to think about lowering that atom amounts and extending the times. Or maybe release a flyer advertising the new items coming with the atom prices. Not everyone can afford to toss down 20 bucks for a power armor set for each member of the family, etc. Not buying doesn't make a difference unless nearly every player does so. I get what you are saying though.
---
reason I asked,  Iv'e had 3 l98's. 2 from 'copa squatter and 1 at fissure prime. Got a lot of stick for mentioning that. -  "they only go up to 92".
---
big black glowing deathclaw just brought that memory back. cheers, thanks for reply.
---
Kinda had the same experience with the game, ive been enjoying it again since a week or two...
---
Most people I meet ingame are very nice and social, and the vendors-update is awesome!
---
Also: a big thumb up for all the high lvl players leaving free stuff in containers at trainstations
---
as Arthur Fleck once said "you get what you deserve". If you play this game you might as well sit in Murray's chair because eventually this game will shoot you in the face.
---
Yes please!
---
As it is currently, good builds in NW don't equate to good builds in Adventure. I had to mess around with my Character way too much for it to work in NW efficiently....
---
Great find!
---
I love to find all those little references and scenes the developers left for us to discover.
---
If you care about the gaming industry then you shouldn’t buy anything from them. You’re saying it doesn’t make a difference, but that’s already 4 people who spend real money on the game. How much did you spend on this in total?
---
And don’t you feel that Bethesda is a company that does ton of anti-consumer practices? They lied about so many things concerning this game that it’s incredible. You could write a book about it.
---
I've noticed...
---
But I also just started farming nuke zones because I finally bought my first few serum recipes
---
And charge $8 for it too!
---
Yep. Like stop adding more atomic shop camp items until you give us more freaking budget.
---
I think that was covered under the section with the green dome.
---
My 2 small water purifiers plus whatever I pick up in world or from events is more than enough...
---
I'm pretty sure it's random, I get more High radiation then the rest and Hardened Mass the least.
---
I know and I bet you can guess that's right the 1st ever video game that contained micro transactions was oblivion when good old Bethesda sold the horse armour back in 2006
---
If you really were an older gamer, you would remember that games did not have any bullshit like this. You bought the game and that was the full thing. No DLC, no live services, no skins, no battle passes, no season passes. Why are you making excuses for this shit? If FO 76 released and it had to stay like that because there are no live updates, no one would be left playing it now. They think they can release a broken game, ask full price for it, and then finish it post launch? Bitch please. And that’s just the tip of the FO76 iceberg.
---
I'll gladly try it! Thanks for the suggestion! Much appreciated!
---
Unless you have something, totally unrelated to fo76, to say. The chance of BGS responding is less than 0.01%.
---
Close enough to not split fucking pube hairs over... Jesus christ...
---
If... If... If... If... If...
---
For all intents and purposes, MY Fallout 1st subscription gives me Atoms for half off.... Or more if I decide to place any sort of value on the tent/junk stash
---
Even when a game defaults to FOV 70, I usually push it to 90. Having to play a game that seems to force less than 70 is such a pain. Playing on a PS4 Pro on a huge 4K TV, so the extra closed off view makes everything feel too close... and FO76 is not a game with good close-up detail for the most part -_-
---
I do have the backpack plan unlocked. I've used backpacks since around level 5 or 6. I can provide proof if needed, but I definetely have the backpack plan unlocked.
---
Yes what i started doing with the wife is we will farm nukes for a week no flux just mass etc and then day 6 or 7 we farm flux and make idk 100 to 130 ish maybe more if super duper loves us.
---
ex·act
---
/iɡˈzakt/
---
adjective
---
not approximated in any way; precise.
---
Truly unfortunate. I wanna love this game so bad but they make it near impossible sometimes.
---
It sounds like you have the small backpack that you pick up in Morgan town. You need the standard backpack.
---
So its an industry standard, get the fuck over it.
---
Wouldn't you say finally having private worlds is an update? Or new content like tent and scrapbox are updates? Whatever you call it, it's not cosmetic.
---
If the issue is events, it makes more sense to rework how the event works with all the players who show up, other than changing the code and messing with how the game would function with parties greater than 4
---
Yes my turrants were shooting my scrap bot and there were no other enemies in the area. One of my team mates also had his turrants attack his own camp last night.
---
I'm not going to debate this. I enjoy the game. I will not be sucked into the "they have wronged us and lied and cheated us" narrative. Yes, bad things have happened. But, people like you (seemingly) want to do nothing but focus on the bad. This game brought our family closer. We enjoy it immensely. We enjoyed it so much we took our first ever family vacation to see the sights of West VA, with cosplay on. We took the time to re-create our in-game looks to include the masks etc. So yes, this company is charging too much but in return we are getting something that is just as valuable. If you aren't enjoying it, move on and get off the soapbox. And I don't say that in a hateful way at all. I just tire of seeing the arguing within the community between those that still love it and are willing to send Bethesda friendly reminders and those that want to get their panties all bunched up and try to make everyone else the same way. I am done. This has gotten away from the OP topic and hijacking a thread is nonsense.
---
Think about what you just asked and then look at what that award represents.
---
The game or the community?
---
2k in nuka colas xD
---
If I could gift someone an atom shop item i would , i got like 3020 atoms just sitting around .
---
Def not an update/expansion. All expansions are free. 
---
I agree scrap box should not be behind paywall. Survival tent should be limited to private servers.
---
Or you're one of *those* people... Gotcha...
---
That probably has a lot to do with the 4 or 5 people knowing what to do and perhaps even more importantly what not to do, and a bunch of random people containing a majority who have no idea about the Dos and Don'ts of that fight. :-)
---
It is not an industry standard. Fuck that shit. Plus these are both free games. Free games need microtransactions to exist. This is a full priced game that has microtransactions AND monthly subscription service on top of that. Can’t get any greedier than that.
---
Why doesn’t Spiderman, God of War, Death Stranding, Last of Us or Dark Souls have microtranctions if it’s the industry standard?
---
Yeah they are relatively rare imo. Im lvl80 now and still dont think i have all the mods, even tho i just craft and scrap time to time. Even people do not sell too much LAR. So far ive seen no more than 10 in player vendors, and ive been to gazillion camps.
---
As we now have bars in some CAMPs, a bartender bot to speak with and buy beverages from would be great
---
I'm not sure what game you're playing but my experience is not similar to yours. I've never had over 200 caps and I don't buy anything. I don't have plans to build anything and most of my CAMP is all things I've purchased in the Atom Store. And the game certainly isn't easy, I've got a Deathclaw Gauntlet that does, I think, 125 damage and the only thing it kills with any type of ease is level 10 and below. As for the backpack issue, if that's the case, then that needs to be clearly communicated. How am I supposed to know that when I've got a backpack already? I'm not wrong in assuming that I don't have what I think I need to craft it. It doesn't give me any indication of what I need to craft it, the Unlock In Atom Shop is the only thing that's greyed out when I try to craft it.
---
Or just create a new character specifically for NW and make him your mule in adventure mode 
---
Playing NW will give you adventure xp and caps which will allow you to get a lot of levels in adventure without even playing it 
---
you can use those free levels for weight reductions cards to help
---
I agree, that's why a lot of players are just waiting for Wastelander to come out.
---
Psa power armor can port you threw all windows most doors xD if you get stuck and cant jump if you enter PA you port to your PA lol
---
If that's the case then thank you, I appreciate the help. However, that needs to be clearly to be clearly communicated. The Unlock In Atom Shop option is greyed out and that's all I can see. I'm not sure what else it's telling me if it doesn't state what you need in order to craft it.
---
Bethesda doesn't care. You already gave them money.
---
I'd also like it if it weren't automatically turned on every time I travel to my base.
---
This is exactly what the thread is about. Bethesda’s greed. First they launched the game broken and still asked for the full price. Then they said that only cosmetic items will be in the shop, only to immediately break that. Then they delayed Wastelanders and instead of that introduced a subscription system that offers nothing for the price they are asking. Instead of actual content they instead thought up of another way to scam people from their money. How can you not be disgusted at this? 
---
At least stop supporting them with your money.
---
Adding anything new to the game is an update. Updates, expansions is just semantics. They  said only paid content will be cosmetic.
---
Stop spending caps and you’ll see them accumulate very quickly. I’ve played trough the main quest from start to finish 3 times. Trust me, you will find it super easy eventually and find yourself having to many caps. Kill every enemy in an area, take their weapons, sell at train station, there- now you have hundreds of caps. 
---
What perks are you using and what level are your weapons? What armor are you wearing? When you bought the skin, it says you need the standard backpack plan to craft.
---
$2 less than the base game
---
So many friends warned me to either skip it or wait til Wastelanders but I just love Fallout so much that I couldn't wait or play Fallout 4 anymore. In general, I'm still not giving up but man, the last week or trying to play this game has been, probably, the most unenjoyable week of gaming for me since I quit CoD 3 or 4 years ago when it started to turn to shit. I had a streamer tell me to literally farm for junk, bulk it then sell it and that'll get me the caps I need. In whose world does that sound like a fun time? 😂
---
That dirty ole mole gives me nocturnal pipe pistols &gt;:[
---
And you're one of ThOsE types I guess
---
The errors seem to differ greatly person to person. I can't really think of any significant errors that ive seen. Im on a PS4 and the game was a download onto my external HD. What about you?
---
Why use anything in the Atom shop apart from repair kits - what else is useful in there? Silly masks and power armour skins dont stop the Purveyour from spewing out shite...
---
Yup, happened to me too.
---
A voluntary monthly sub. Lets look at WoW or FF14 that are full priced and have a compulsory monthly fee. both are loaded with MTX. Or GTA5 and RDR2. Full priced and straight up pay2win. 
---
Also those games are mostly single player one and done games. I.E. development ends shortly after release.
---
Based on what was available at launch, yes. They also said in August 2018 that if they added private servers it would be a separate service provided by them that you could purchase.
---
YES.
---
Did you finish the scouts questline?
---
You wrote “micro transactions” and “updates”. Private worlds and scrap boxes aren’t in anyway an *update* those are QoL additions, it doesn’t change/add to overall game we all play or have been playing for a year. When you or anyone else say an “update” people are assuming a DLC with new content.
---
That's the thing though, I don't spend caps. 99.9% of the things in my CAMP are from the Atom Shop and my weapons and armor aren't bought either, I crafted them or modded them when I got them. I spend most of my caps on fast traveling honestly. And if I sell weapons, then what? I've got no mods for anything unless there's another way to unlock mods for weapons?
---
As for the perks and weapons and whatnot, I'm not currently playing but I can post all that stuff here later when I wake up from my nap.
---
Main story questline?
---
Stop fast traveling then..... every event you complete gives you caps, most enemies you kill give you caps. There are so many sources of caps in this game. Sell excess chems, that’s another good source. 
---
You don’t need to exclusively sell weapons. I am saying do one run of selling all the weapons in an area. Eventually you stop learning mods from scrapping anyway.
---
You were saying that it’s an industry standard. I proved that it’s not. It’s a standard for mobile games. Not full priced AAA games.
---
Wow and FF 14 are MMO RPG’s. That’s a different category. But now brave Bethesda wants to push the boundaries of greed and put subscription service in an AAA game.
---
Not a 100% sure on all of the perks comparability with power armor, but I am sure serendipity doesn't work in power armor even though the icon appears as if it is working.
---
Then you need to stop supporting all cell phone companies, retailers, internet providers etc. Same problems, different companies. What I meant is I will not hijack a thread to continue arguing with someone who refuses to see the beauty that Bethesda did give us. Every game has its brokenness. Since before launch people have been trashing this game. Guess what, Overwatch has some of the same issues. Again, this is my last reply. I won't be goaded into an all out argument. I love the game and the bugs I have experienced have been minimal and not enough for me to boycott or quit. No game will ever come out without patches. So, you enjoy lurking in posts and being negative. Meanwhile, I will enjoy the game I have gotten and comment occasionally on things in a positive note so that maybe Bethesda will hear. Sometimes its the honey that draws the person, not the tang.
---
I would, but I’ve already put so many levels into my main on NW. I really don’t want to work back up to level 90, if that makes sense. It’s not a bad tip though, thank you.
---
If you sell out the vendor you'll have reached the max cap limit on one character in 3 weeks. 30000 Caps it really gets easier as you level up.
---
Judging from recent posts, I don't think Bethesda care anymore.
---
Considering that this will only take about 20-30 minutes until you have enough for the daily caps, it's just a very small part of the grind.
---
The real grind comes when you start hunting specific legendaries.
---
There’s already a white glass shelf in game since launch. That should be modified to be a display case as well.
---
Just buy 1, read it, do the quest, and go buy the other. Ull do 3 in a day. Then the next day, just buy 2.
---
Wow, you are an absolute sheep. You are like a blind follower that closes their eyes and puts fingers in their ears and screams CANT HEAR YOU LALALALALA. Wake up. You can like the game and still criticize it like a normal adult with critical mind.
---
This is 100% a problem, but it's not so much the drop rate.
---
It's the fact that glowing and hardened mass seem to drop in quantities from 1-3, and high rad fluids only seem to drop in singles.
---
Stop fast traveling? Then how am I supposed to finish the main story? More and more, I get the feeling that there's a level of grind to completing the main story and I just can't agree with that. I just wanna finish the story in peace and quiet then worry about everything else the game offers AFTER the story. I don't wanna have to stress and worry about caps and resource management before I even finish the story.
---
No wonder so many people are selling their raid sets.
---
Walk
---
Try out a cola nut build.
---
Benefits: 
---
1. cola heals have no animation so they don't interrupt other actions like stimpacks do
---
2. Cola heals stack, you can hit quantums as a panic button for a much better heal than a super stimpack
---
3. Your thirst is always full
---
4. Most colas recover AP
---
Downsides:
---
1. Colas are heavy so thru hiker is a must
---
2. Quantums can be hard to stockpile.
---
I think you have serious problems and should stop playing this game.
---
Yet the radios are always turned off, I wish they were on by default.
---
And I'm perfectly happy to grind for specific pieces of gear. But while I'm playing the story, I wanna do exactly that, play the story. Nothing more and nothing less.

The only problem with making the scrap box for all is then they would lose the biggest feature to 1st. They aren’t hurting for subscribers either, 70% of all camps I go to on XB have scrap boxes. I have fought the SBQ many times since the release of 1st and almost every player there throws down a survival tent (kind of funny everyone gathers at one though haha). Because of this I don’t see them anytime soon or at all making this a “base” game feature.
---
Exploring is cool but if Betheseda would've created a decent story, I likely would feel inclined to take my time with it but the story in this game is probably one of the worst I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong though, I love exploring in Fallout. But I like to complete the story and have the majority of side missions and areas still left to complete after I complete the story.
---
Just don't forget to use the perk, and learn which event that rewards water. And there is plenty of drinks all over.
---
My problem is, I have nothing left to sell and going out and grinding for junk just doesn't appeal to me whatsoever. I'm sorry, I truly am but I think this game just appeals to a different breed of gamer than I am cause this game just ain't it for me which saddens me.
---
 Adding anything new to the game is an update. They said only paid content will be cosmetic.
---
Bethesda dailies in a nutshell
---
No worries
---
What do you play on? I have an abundance of... stuff...
---
Plans, caps, blah blah blah, lol
---
Xbox
---
You are much better off spending those 18 bucks to buy a better game. Seriously, why would anyone be stupid enough to buy a useless skin when you can get a brand new game?
---
Old myth, was never confirmed and has now been debunked by dataminers.
---
what kind of stuff are you selling?
---
Or it could just say you already own that key when you try picking it up
---
I've been playing for a little over a week and struggling with this game at times.
---
Far to often I find myself over encumbered, infected with swamp herpes, pinned down, hardly any ammo, and the only healing items being a bunch of food i'd recently picked up,
---
But at other times I just murder enemies as if i was playing any other Fallout game on easy mode.
---
No you didn't. You pointed to a handful of singleplayer games. I pointed to other AAA online multiplayer games that actually cost more money this game. FO76 has more in common with WoW than it does with fucking god of war.
---
Take your time, do more side quests, explore. By the time you get to the Enclave part of the main quest line, you should at least be in your high 40's or low 50's, level-wise. Go back to areas in the Forest, Ash Heap or Toxic Valley if the level scaling in the Divide, Mire or Bog throws mobs at you that are too high-level for you to handle. The level scaling is hampered by the fact that - AFAIK - it can't scale existing mobs, it can only create new ones at the desired level. So if a bunch of level 100 players recently walked through an area you are in and didn't kill everything in sight, you'll get their left-overs to deal with, which can be a tough challenge.
---
Caps are plentiful. Find areas populated by super mutants, mole miners or scorched, kill them and sell everything they drop at the nearest vendor. Don't buy ammo from the vending machines or vendors at the train stations. Instead get the Ammo Smith perk in Agility and craft your own, or buy them from vending machines at player CAMPs for 1c per bullet. That said, event and quest rewards can be underwhelming, that is true, but lack of caps is not the issue.
---
The levels between 20 and 45 can be the toughest in the game - I know I felt under-geared and generally under-resourced in that level range. It gets a easier after that.
---
I have a Mirelurk King here that says 'hold my beer' :P
---
PlayStation unfortunately 😭 I appreciate the offer though! 👌
---
It sure does, at least when it comes to greedy monetization practices and providing players with grindy bullshit instead of giving them gripping story and involved combat. You are absolutely correct there.
---
If you don't play in a group that will not be possible.
---
You don't get enough xp from following the story or the questline to actually be strong enough to see it through.
---
will add you 
---
my psn: Owl_No
---
Have it be the pistol variant of "The Fixer" with it's own unique bonuses while being able to get random legendary effects at the purveyor.
---
Any thing below 100000 of rare items doesn't qualify as a super. And it's not even close and none are rare.
---
3700+ in Stimpacks.
---
I literally just want the Jukebox because it looks cool. I love having anything with neon lights in my C.A.M.P. But I refuse to have the Jukebox (as much as I want to have it) because it plays classical music EVERY. FUCKING. TIME. I. FAST. TRAVEL. BACK. TO. MY. CAMP.
---
Just turn it off already. I just want the pretty lights.
---
(Or better yet change it to the Appalachian Radio)
---
Yeah and see, I just don't agree with that. To me, it just doesn't feel good. I guess I've gotta just embrace the suck and hope it gets better.
---
This guy gets it. The highest priced items aren't intended for the general playerbase to purchase, it's just a super expensive item for the people who simply have to have everything and don't value money.
---
" They also said in August 2018 that if they added private servers it would be a separate service provided by them that you could purchase. " I missed that, do you have a link pls? Still scrapboxes and tents as content that's not cosmetic, and thus should be free.
---
One of my biggest concerns is that mods will by tied to private servers. This game is in terrible need of the modding community. Given past experience an unofficial patch would have fixed most bugs by now.
---
Alright, thanks man. Didnt know that.
---
Making us unable to get a second copy and marking it unique would be better in long term. Letting us scrap could lead to problems like people complaining they scraped the first copy of a unique item.
---
Sounds like your love of Fallout made you enjoy the game.morw than you should have. Despite the completely broken nature of 76, you pressed on, because it's Fallout. I had the opposite experience. I tried to enjoy it, but the game is just too broken. I realized I was forcing myself to keep playing.
---
I remember how broken the beta was. And everyone said it'll be fine because it's a beta and Bethesda will fix the game before launch. The beta was two weeks before launch. Nothing was gonna be fixed. And sure enough, nothing was. When the game launched in that broken state, I knew then that this game was dead. Bethesda wasn't gonna fix this game. If they truly wanted to fix it, they would've delayed release. They launched it broken, because they wanted to. Because people would still buy it. And they did. And a year later, it's the same mess.
---
Now, I check back in here and there to see what's improved. Nothing. So the game mostly collects dust on my shelf. Only times I consistently play is if a friend asks if I want to play with her. Which sure, I can do that once in a while.
---
Any good place to farm colas?
---
Just to clarify: The servers being a paid subscription was known since at least august of last year.
---
This a more elegant solution
---
You're only selling ammo and a couple of plans my man.... and it's not a "sale" at all 😅😂
---
The nuka cola factory and player vendors are where I get mine. A lot of people sell nuka cherries and nuka quantums for 10c and 30c
---
I genuinely appreciate the kind words and helpful tips! I'm taking everything said here to heart and I'm hoping it'll get me through this "shitty", for lack of a better term, part of the game. I really thought I would love the game the more and more I played with, be it unlocking new things (weapons, armor, mods, plans, etc..), exploring new areas but it's actually been the complete opposite and I just get more and more upset because of things, while controllable, are unknown to new players because of the lack of any kind of hints and/or communications on how the game progresses because it truly is nothing like any past Fallout game when it comes to progression.
---
But it's a jukebox, not a radio.
---
Welp, guess there's more material for youtubers tomorrow morning!
---
Suck my beautiful sack, stranger.
---
(For real though, I'd probably prefer it just not being on at all)
---
I think some one at bethesda is reading this. Say that you dislike bethesda and see the downvotes. Even if you say that you like fallout 76 very much but not bethesda any more.
---
Coming next update. Clean jukebox in the atom store for only 800 atoms
---
Still not enough stems i need at least 10k more lol
---
I'm also on PS4 and my game.is also installed on an external hard drive.
---
From launch to this day, I still lag around all the time, enemies warp around, they randomly don't take damage, they randomly damage me without doing their attack animation. Sound glitches, like my friend fires her gun and when she goes to reload, the sound of it firing doesn't stop, so I just hear shooting whenever I'm near her. Quests disappearing from my quest log, they don't show up unless I reset the game. I kill an enemy and it's corpse disappears so I can't loot it. My friend removing quests from her list, but they don't disappear from my screen. My little doggie bag not appearing after I die and respawn so I lose all my scrap. Quest markers being in the wrong location or not appearing at all. I die and when I try to respawn, all the location markers have disappeared so I have to reset the game. Being on a crafting table and when I quit out of the crafting, it puts me right back in so I have to just keep trying to leave until it lets me. Getting disconnected from the server, this happens AT LEAST once per gameplay session.
---
I can go on, I definitely didn't mention everything, but all these things, I've encountered in the past week! That's why I say I don't see improvements. These things have been happening since launch and are STILL happening.
---
Fallout 76 is the bug.
---
Hahaha thats funny....they will easily win lol 😁
---
Nobody cares about your opinion of stuff, the fact is this is an industry standard to help finance the continued development of the game. Also I love everyone bitches if a game is rushed but whine even more when its delayed. Make up your fucking mind.
---
My opinion is the scrap box shouldn’t exist at all. 1st already has private servers and 19,800 atoms annually. That’s enough.
---
Well, it's the only game I've been playing for exactly one year now, so for me and some others, it is the best one, but I'm afraid we are but a small niche of the market. :-/
---
I miss the carbine rifles from fo3 and Vegas more 😩
---
I’m on a train right now with spotty service. I hate doing this but if you search this sub you’ll find a number of links to Pete Hines discussing on Twitter. He has also said in interviews but those are harder to find with as much news that has hurried them. 
---
I don’t really have any interest in mods personally. If I want those I play FO4.
---
Ok I have a zealots exploding with reduced weight but that’s not what your looking for
---
I wouldn’t mind them unlinking cards to points in adventure mode too.  If I want to run a high intellect and luck numbers of points but a rifle build, let me.
---
You are missing a lot of the story/lore by rushing. If it’s really the worst you’ve ever seen, you haven’t played many games. Have you don’t mistress of mysteries quest? Hard to say that isn’t well written. 
---
This game is designed for you to take your time. You’ll get a lot more out of it. How far into the story are you? The writing and way they connect characters across factions is very interesting IMO.
---
That would cause issues, some people have over 200 keycards, that's 200 plastic, and they could get a lot more,
---
No. Pioneer scouts.
---
I dunno, maybe it's the lack of presentation that kills the story for me? I'm not sure what it is. I have the Mistress of Mysteries quest active and I'm trying to complete it but it's like most of my other quests that are level capped for me at the  moment and I agree, the writing and factions are cool but the no NPCd thing really kinda kills it for me I think.
---
You play FO76 with your business partner?  That's awesome!
---
I'd have to check to be certain but I don't believe so, no.
---
My camp budget has been reduced since the update ?
---
Do you plan on carrying alot of fusion cores &amp; using Gatling lasers? If so I'd recommend grabbing power user and batteries included
---
mods would need to be tied to private servers if they added or changed anything to the game other then textures or the UI
---
hehe vamp ultra  laser gat blocker bullet sheild fireproof lone wanderer. bring it all  :P 
---
its a good build for everything but pvp and it is PA dependant.
---
Bobbleheads and magazines received weight reduction as well as turrerts. Perhaps this is the answer.
---
Like I said this is an RPG, your characters strength matters more than your player skill. For me the game would be pointless without legendaries as if I want a skill based shooter where my build and gear doesn't matter ill play an actual skill based shooter like apex. Just because trading partially happens outside the game doesn't mean its broken, its honestly half of what has kept this game alive and makes it interesting imo. Its all about people trying to beat the RNG system that bethesda put in place to 
---
make it near impossible to get good stuff and I am a believer in innovation as opposed to playing by the rules that bethesda wants so you 
---
just become a grinding zombie fuck that.
---
To me it sounds like you want more of a challenge, if you want non legendary pvp  go to nuclear winter if you want more of a challenge seek out other players that have good gear and pvp becomes very exciting as opposed to slaughtering people all the time. Honestly if you've put in some effort to get good gear you should be able to reap the rewards not 
---
have them taken away from you.
---
What level are you?
---
&gt; Vault Steel - 150
---
bruh
---
33.
---
Ait thanks, gonna start the game now and see for myself, sad times incoming
---
Yes, I know, that's a big reason why paid servers is a concern. I've played many game where you host a game and people join your game, why cant f76 work like that?
---
This has been interesting, I've seen if I say something negative about bethesda I get downvoted. So I made a point to mention that I like fallout 76, thinking people here didn't get the distinction. I like the game but not the company (anymore). Now I wonder are some here huge bethesda fans or are some one from bethesda here?
---
I cant submit pics I am at work. but the large tent plans a few flags and some green defensiveness walls make for a verly millitary looking camp. pile up some random ammo stash baockes and military footlockers etc.  my last camp had a generator tent, a crafting tent a barracks with three beds and the vendors were out in the open in an open air market.
---
Nuked zone around the CAMP isn't actually that bad because you can avoid it or hop.
---
However the *real* problem is logging in with *your character* in a nuke zone. This is the lethal thing which you can only *try* to avoid.
---
I'm not saying I won't adjust my playstyle to fit the game, I just made a list of things I personally see wrong it. I'm not trying to upset anyone or seem elitist. I simply thought I would enjoy the game because it was, at it's core, still Fallout and while I still think this is mostly true, maybe you're right and this game just simply, isn't for me. Time will tell.
---
Dang, congrats. Have they nerfed the beam splitter yet, or is it still hilariously OP for 5 minutes before you need to repair it?
---
I have a ts/ffr flamer and it kills shit VERY well with relatively little ammo consumption if you can actually muster a little trigger discipline. 
---
Also have a vampire/ffr flamer and that's even better. It's like a stimpack that melts things in half a second. 
---
Did you actually try using a flamer with all the proper perks and techniques? Or did you maybe get a vanilla flamer, jam on the trigger the whole time, and say it's useless?
---
Because people would pick up keys that exist as world loot for scrap and newer players would have problem finding keys to certain places if they changed it.
---
Same deal on ps4 if you send me request same ign! Can help with your quests, gear whatever
---
Same for myself. I'm not on currently but shoot me a friend request and we'll play sometime!
---
I used the heavy gunner perks and bloody mess. It's mostly the ammo upkeep that's totally unreasonable.
---

Welcome to the world of \*swoosh sparkle\* ADVERTISEMENT \*swoosh sparkle\* i hope you have a very pleasant stay! Don't forget to buy 1st, its very very splendid trust me ,for i called Mr.Sellyouthings!
---
I find that everything is harder on private servers
---
Oh ok I understand, thank you for your answer
---
I said it should never have existed in the first place. I don’t know what they do now. I never said they should take it away. Buy yea $100 for 19,800 atoms would be worth it for someone who buys atoms. I don’t personally. Nor would I really want a scrap box or private worlds. I play on my friends’ worlds occasionally. But that’s about it.
---
Reading helps.
---
There is one argument which is that they can beef up their EC2 instances to provide better server stability because of the supporting income from F1st
---
You should be high enough to complete mistress quests. I was leve 20 when I finished that on my first character. It was difficult but doable. Second time I was over 50 and it was a cake walk. You are at a good level for that quest.
---
For the most part trailers always showed a 4 against 4 pvp type stuff.
---
 As a solo non pvp player I never had any interest in that at all.
---
 Most Fallout fans are used to a single player environment.  Outside of end game events I rarely if ever see more than one player dot in an area at a time.
---
The real crime is that they are selling Salves for 20 and Stimpacks for 10.
---
Ah I thought you meant it should be taken away. I’m not sure, if it was only atoms, private worlds and smaller things included I would still get rid of my first and I think others would too. Just being atoms with nothing else, it’s almost the same as the last model. Most people wouldn’t be able to justify paying each month, not everyone is all about the atom store skins and if they are just single purchases would probably sound much better only because you can see what comes and if you want it first. The scrap box and the tent make you feel like you want to keep the subscription, it’s a viable thing all the time knowing you want it. It’s a game version of a material item you can have at the moment, skins right now in the store to me are lame. Its a useless month for only atoms for me, and probably others as well
---
Maybe I've just lost my patience with how long the story is, I don't know. I just really want to grind and explore, that's about it.
---
What card are you missing ?
---
Well JEEZ! I'd wish they just finally allow "The Action Hero" .50 cal to have paint jobs on it! I bought that Gold paint and still haven't been able to use it at all! Blow booty chunks I say!
---
Glad to see some patch notes at least though I guesssss@!
---
You could always try.
---
Actually 600.
---
Because some stupid people are willing to buy it.
---
Now after the last shutdown, i can no longer click play in the launcher, it wants to me reinstall the game when al the game files are still on my computer
---
I dont know just yet. Maybe. But I'll keep it in mind! Thank you.
---
Me too.
---
Every input you make (scroll, click) should reset the timer.
---
Master rifelman
---
Then do that? Take a break from the story. You’ll have fun.  Do the pioneer scouts to get that backpack.
---
yup, there's easily 50+ movie and serial references
---
just farm the plans for a couple of runs and gg
---
wtf beth
---
It is! A new one released Tuesday for 300a
---
Thanks!
---
The trailers WAY over-estimated PvPs importance in the game.
---
Or the 700 technical data I have for cloth ,_,
---
You pointed out 2 MMO RPG’s which are a completely different breed of games, and GTA and RDR. I can find you hundreds of games that are full priced and have no microtransactions, which proved that it is not an industry standard. 
---
And the funny thing is, even if it was, that still doesn’t make it okay. Companies are trying to push new and scummier ways of monetization on us. Gamers need to get together and boycott this shit, but people like you make that harder because obviously you are content with getting fucked over.
---
And I already said that I don’t need to make up my mind. Don’t release unfinished games.
---
You can display the comic on the new shelf I believe just like you can with plans and pretty much everything that will fit, the oulfit won't fit the head is too big I'm sorry dude
---
You’re helping his point. He’s saying it takes longer to fix complicated (reloading changing legendary effect) and/or game-breaking bugs. He’s saying they are working on them, but other teams are working on smaller issues, so don’t use fixing easier stuff simultaneously to push an agenda.     
---
He’s saying it takes a long time to fix game breaking bugs,
---
You’re saying they’ve fixed game-breaking bugs, but it took a long time. You’re helping more by giving examples of them fixing game-breaking bugs after a long time. Your doing a better job than he of giving Bethesda credit. 
---
You’re agreeing 100% with his original point, and as such, you’re supporting his follow up point.
---
Blueprinting and then scrapping it won't work? Or you've been afraid to try in case it screws you?
---
I run into this when I die in powerarmor and I am under weight if wearing pa but overweight with out it
---
Ah fair does, is the lag still terrible in those vaults?
---
Knew i recogized your name! Good game man, it wasnt a total loss. Those three or four bulk scrap rewards were pretty good. Did you you guys get them too?
---
Brill :)
---
No problem :)
---
Any way I can get that graph without paying a premium to see it XD
---
Ah fair does, is stealth not as effective in the raids?
---
So you have to pay monthly??
---
 I had to pay the 119EUR at once, and now wonder when my atoms will come for the second month.
---
And a lot of the game design.
---
Not that most bugs and glitches have a logical explanation, but THAT'S the reason why I respawn at 76 on occasion?  Because I'm over encumbered?
---
That could be, than it would be in 4 Days for me.
---
Actually lag was not a problem at all! I do have good internet tho. Terminals took a few seconds to load, but no more than usual terminals. I was pretty shocked by how stable it turned out to be. Couldve been luck, but lag was no problem at all
---
Dropping for trade was not what I was envisioning when I made the post. I’m saying it’s very easy to do it on complete accident, and it has people already, as evidenced by some of the replies to this.  
---
The system in place makes it too easy to permanently delete items when they are painted.  Whereas if you don’t have paint on a weapon, accidentally dropping a favorited weapon is both more difficult and leads to less permanent consequences (you can still pick the weapon up once you dropped it).
---
Which ones specifically?
---
It does its job.. but it some parts it’s just hard to be stealthy whens there’s 20 Mirelurks/ Ghouls in your face constantly respawning! 
---
Also if you are constantly stood still and in stealth you most likely are not completing your part of the objectives for you team.. therefore again making you a crutch to your team.. bloodied can work in there don’t get me wrong.. just it’s definitely not the super power it is outside the vault!
---
Which event were you waiting for?
---
You could trade with someone. I get plenty glowing and hardened but hardly any high radiation.
---
I did! And without a doubt, everyone did great! I'm excited to give it another go sometime, but man oh man that time is not today 😂
---
It's always been a bit random like that, with hardened mass dropping the most, on average, but 2 weeks ago, I was running out of HM, and had an excess of HRF, last week I had an excess of GM, and so far this week, HRF is scarce.
---
And for some reason, people seem to think these items are worth a fortune, I will buy HRF @ up to 30 caps each, but more frequently see it in vendors for 50+ which makes no sense while the average price of Stable Flux is under 100c.
---
I came upon one this morning that had HRF @ 66c, and Stable Flux @ 75c, I bought all the SF.
---
Ah brilliant, I remember people saying that was a huge problem when they first launched. Glad to hear they're actually playable then haha.
---
Sounds good to me :)
---
I just assumed that he meant faster reload 😂
---
What does it look like? Is the geometry different than the handmade?
---
Haha that's fair, I do use unyielding so i'm usually undetected when moving. I'll give it a go in there and see how I fare, if not then i'll definitely have to change.
---
Nuke whitesprings. Glowing ghouls seem to be the best source of high radiation fluids. Once you nuke it you have 2 1/2 hours to farm. Run through then relog to respawn the ghouls. Can do it a bunch of times. Good source of xp as well. My only issue is the amount of anmo I go through.
---
I've always thought so too. Bloated glowing ones should always drop them. Since they are hard to come by I started looking for them at vendors so far I'm up to 64!
---
The SBQ's health scales to the number of people in the event.
---
&gt; ...because the person who dropped the nuke didn’t place it right to fight her outside of the zone...
---
If playing by the meta is the only "right" way, then aren't you also playing the game wrong by using pistols? The answer is "no" because there is no right or wrong way
---
They said in the OP that with Weapon Paint (all are Atom Shop paints), it asks if you want to destroy the item.
---
Their issue, is that the default option is YES to destroy painted items, but NO to drop favourited items.
---
I forgot about the legendary perks. I think initially I was motivated to get to 350 just for that very reason.   Thanks for the reminder!
---
Seems legit. I concede your point.
---
I'd be happy just to be able to throw the extra keys away
---
You're welcome :)
---
Ok misread.
---
So basically if you subscribed to Fallout 1st within the first few days of it launching you're now getting all of the Power Armor from the raids due to getting 600 Vault Steel.  Can we call Fallout 1st pay to win yet?  Or are the whales still defending it as if their lives depend on it?
---
what do you want them to show exactly?
---
''heres a picture of a random settler in front of shack prefab #6''
---
''heres a picture of a random settler walking between shack prefab #3 and outhouse model #2''
---
Theres just not much to show since the main premise of Wastelanders is NPCS and more story. Releasing a plain text document of dialogue and story details might be interesting for the 3 of us who frequent r/falloutlore, but it wouldn't be a super interesting thing for anyone else.
---
I leveled up a shit ton!
---
there are lots of weapon mods that are broken for various guns. for example, the "Heavy Barrel" for the Auto Grenade launcher is supposed to increase damage but right now it is just a heavier long barrel.
---
“Damn, it had a full tank of gas”.
---
I would love to see the R91 and service rifles come back. 76 has a nice selection of weapons but I wish it was as wide and diverse as NVs. instead of having 2-3 weapons in each category
---
Same for me, just recieved an email my psn service is extended, got it especially for this game. I did have a lot of fun playing. Sure hope they come with some new content soon so i can pick it up again.
---
Hip fire. +hip fire accuracy weapon mods increase VATS accuracy.
---
I forgot I mentioned GTA and RDR2. 6 games I made apt comparisons too. And all 6 of them have more in common with fo76 than fucking spiderman does and all of them are massively succesful games. Its an industry standard, get over it. 
---
Its just a fucking video game man. If you don't like then don't fucking buy it. Spare us your faux indignation. 
---
&gt; Don’t release unfinished games.
---
THEN STOP FUCKING CRYING ABOUT WASTELANDERS BEING DELAYED.
---
Not the hero we we deserve, but the hero we need. 
---
You are adding content to the game.
---
Apparently they are coming in the Christmas event! The SBQ and regular SB might be around Wastelanders by the looks of it though!
---
Also, somebody made a bot that downvotes every post topic after it is published, it doesn't do it to post replies, but if you ever make a post and see it auto downvoted after you make it, it's a bot, wait a bit and see what the actual response is.
---
It counts as hip fire
---
I think the probability is the same, but A: some events seem more likely than others (Tea Time, for example) and B: not all Public Events have consistent activation timers.  I can't remember which one it was - maybe Line in the Sand - but it waits a good 30 minutes for someone to activate it while the others will time out in 5-10.  If it's an unpopular event, that's 30 wasted minutes.
---
Cause instead of eliminating the scorched we just made room for legendary Scorch Beasts!
---
Fallout 76 doesn't even feel like Fallout the timeless theme is now happy and peachy apocalypse it's not the same at all.
---
Last patch made turrets go rogue.
---
First of all - the SBQ doesn't scale to the number of players in the fight.  All the other posters need to stop perpetuating this myth.
---
Second, in the 1 or 2 times I've fought the SBQ on private, I didn't notice much of a difference in her health.  But I would suspect that because latency is better on private servers, more hits actually register correctly.  Anyone who does melee knows what I'm talking about - about 20-30% of the time, the game just ignores your damage.  That makes quite a difference over time when your damage is in the thousands.
---
Not sure of other platforms, but Xb has 65 million active XB live members, and FO76 has been in the #30's in their 50 "most played" games list for months.
---
weird, sounds bugged, submit a ticket, your only choice right now im afraid
---
Plenty of three stars but they are all level 40 or level 35. Even with a nice roll few people want a just-below-max-level weapon. So, it's all scrip fodder.
---
I like the coffin as well. Smaller profile than the Corvega.
---
Selling explosive energy weapons at the vendor for 100c cuz you're melee and wtf is a legacy
---
I love the luggage pile. Screams serial killer.
---
Hmm, true.. thank you!
---
One thing I'd like to throw out there - whatever you select, be aware that there is *no* confirmation prompt.
---
I was pretty close to getting the mascot outfit a week ago when I decided to check prices, and one misclick led to my wasting Fuzzy Tokens on a worthless magazine.
---
I'm not sure where you're getting the happy and peachy part from. There was one trailer for the game that went down that path, but in-game is still typical post-apoc for the most part. I've never felt there was a lot of happiness going on while exploring.... just dead people and decay and robots lol. 
---
Some of the atom shop stuff is pretty jarring and cutesy, but I don't count that as lore cause marketing people probably don't give a shit if they think it'll sell. xD
---
I often wonder if I ever got rid of anything that would have made me filthy rich cause I didn't understand what it did!
---
I have to admit, the return of slap damage, and involuntary PvP would be interesting. The return of every known dupe method would be game ending.
---
Eeeep. I can confirm this. Just tested it.
---
Who is in charge of the UI here?
---
Its refreshing to find people who respect proper pvp engagements. If I lose a battle, I'll drop a 3* weapon (scrip scrap of course) as a sign of defeat and respect.
---
So glad you said that. First thing I thought when I read that is “ no way he’s going to make it on such low health.” Though I wish him the best. :)
---
Ok, then i'll have to re think this a little bit. But it sounds great. Thanks man👌
---
The Lord Howard giveth and The Lord taketh.
---
Oh yeah idc about level Bc I sell my legendaries for just below 20caps per scrip and everything sells
---
I was talking about the trailer aspects but yeah lore isn't a big selling point to alot of little kids (not a insult but there's alot of little kids playing now)
---
I know I absolutely have. I remember trying to sell a tse flamer and nobody wanted it because it's a flamer. All anyone want back then was tse dragons
---
Thank you for responding.
---
Sistem
---
I made sure to give my pistol/shotgunner a fallback in unarmed melee just for dealing with the Queen.  There's really no comparison, both in damage output and ammo conservation.  Pistols do a good job of killing the adds, which can in turn get your Adrenaline way up, but they are abysmal against the Queen herself.
---
one of the few bloody good questions, maybe someone out there, has a definitive answer,we'll wait and see.
---
I'm going with steelocke- neither. vats is a law unto itself.
---
Actually, I spent $200, because I bought it on 2 separate accounts, for multiple reasons.
---
1. It's a great value, Atoms alone are a good deal.
---
2. I love the game and want to help fund future development.
---
3. Scrapbox &amp; Tent are significant QOL conveniences.
---
4. Private Servers are a ton of fun with 7 of your friends, or a peaceful place, when you just want to be alone in the wasteland for a while.
---
I realize not everyone is able to afford such luxuries, and it wouldn't bother me in the least if all the benefits were made available to others by some other means, what others get for free, or pay less for does not affect my gameplay, or diminish the value I place on the subscription.
---
Start a new character, start the quest but don't finish it, every time that character logs into a world the stranglers will be blooming. More radshield than you can shake a stick at.
---
That is the best solution so far.
---
Wow, I try to tell others to stop complaining about paying a lousy $8.99 or $18.00 when they charge others far more for something they got for free. At least qualify what “serious problems” mean. You are the same kind of pathetic person in life that isn’t worth anything. How long did it come up with “I think you have serious problems and should stop playing this game.” How many hours did you sit in the dim glow of the computer screen pondering everything in your head in order to finally hit the keys to necessary to produce this earth shattering statement. I at least was able to produce a full and complete statement. You, however, decided that in order to be a hero for the cause decided to bypass the well established format that people of education and good social standing abide by. They at least would have said something of substance. They would have had an example or two to depict why in fact I may have a problem. You fancy yourself to be above all of that. Somehow God imbued you with super human powers that allow you to be so smart that you don’t have to make any sense. Well, God bless you. You are special.
---
My poor corn soup is just begging to be eaten.
---
Yeah I'm really not sure. Tough to test as well because I dont think that anything directly boosts damage when sighted/hipfire so would have to get an enemy in vats and compare hit chance with perks mods. Gotta get them undetected and standing still so it doesnt mess with the test 😀
---
We all run PA in this week and I run it in all the other weeks. The rads are gradual. I would not run at nerd rage. Field surgeon is good too. Pain Train is actually a very useful perk in the vault. Remember you dont have to kill everything until the last room.
---
All I ever find on PC are some weak scrubs at workshops. Never any groups that give a challenge, I need more junk from people lol
---
Definitely not. This came up a number of times here yesterday. You can put things ON it like any other table but it is not a display case item.
---
Well aren't we a sadomasochist who loves self-torture.
---
wow
---
Im down for Vault Raid parties. Add me. PSN: Itzoma
---
I have been told not all the mods come from scrapping. The prime receiver plan is only dropped by the sbq, please tell me if I am wrong because I have been looking for it for some time now.
---
A dataminer figured this out by looking at benefits, I'll try to find it.
---
Did you get the railway prime receiver mod through scrapping? I have been told that it is only acquired by killing the sbq. I have been searching far too long for it.
---
Likely a driver conflict, though I'm used to those throwing up a BSOD.  A restart is possible, though I'd attribute those more to temp issues (which you're already on top of).  But make sure you're monitoring your graphics card, not just your CPU, if you're not doing that already.
---
You can try digging into the log files to see if you can narrow down the issue (which I'd strongly suggest), but until then you can try updating your graphic card drivers, or rolling back if you're up to date, and see if that has an effect.
---
You used so many words, when you could’ve just said “I love getting fucked in the ass by Bethesda, and I’m also being a pretentious prick about it.”
---
I basically kill everything with a couple shots. Im a commando build and it wrecks.
---
Thanks internet history, here is a link  [https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/CombatRifle\_Fixer](https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/CombatRifle_Fixer)  it is from a comment thread here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drfurd/my\_stealth\_commando\_build\_sbq\_solo\_in\_less\_then\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/drfurd/my_stealth_commando_build_sbq_solo_in_less_then_2/)  in a comment post from u/foob4red
---
Think I cited my sources properly.
---
Any clothing from the Atomic Shop or items bearing skins from the atomic shop may not be traded or dropped; only destroyed or stashed.
---
&gt; a technical limitation.
---
That just means 'its hard' and 'we dont wanna figure it out'
---
Yeah, because I loved it when scorchbeasts would continually do their sonic attack, making fighting them a VATS only battle because you were constantly blind.  And gee golly was getting stuck in your PA and not being able to leave it fun!!!  And remember when your tamed pets would attach generators or artillery in your camp?  What a hoot that was!!  Gosh do I miss all these things!

Squirrel Scout is the next rank up.

**Hey - so notes from last night:**
---
* When initially noticed Two nights ago - the experience was as described in the *other player's* example in your 'Example 1'.
---
   * *There seemed to be no cloth weight/bones to the long coat-tails and walking, running, crippled-walking*
---
   * *It doesn't billow as you mentioned but seems rigid &amp; glued to the character limbs*
---
   * *all tested prior had the effective visual appearance of moving in tandem with your legs as if it was part of the pants*
---
   * *It was very very noticeable and I wish I recorded it at the time now tbh.*
---
* Fast Forward to yesterday - The launcher updates and forgets the game is installed
---
   * After sorting that out - I jumped in and began running the tests.
---
* **Issue gone 🙃**
---
* **It appears that after forcing the launcher to comb through the files the update's 'ill effects' are gone and the outfits now behave / look as one would 'generally' expect them too when moving**
---
I had this problem on ps4, turning right, got a new controller problem solved, but have now broken new controller down button on the dpad :(  Both less than 6 months old, come on Sony really?
---
Fallout 76 has one of the nicest communities of any game I've ever played. I really hope that its not changing.
---
I have the Same Problem.   i have a ton of the other stuff.    just never have any luck with the High Radiation Fluids aswell.     hell i wish we could just craft it.  make it like a terrible ratio or something so it can't be super mass produced.   so many times ive only needed one or two more to make something.
---
These things seem to cycle.  Sometimes its fluid that rarely drop.  other times its hardened mass.  Other times glowing.  This is why I tend to stockpile those items so whenever there's a drought on one I have plenty to see me through.
---
Ah, thanks.
---
yut
---
It might have to do with the type of enemies, because I've found a lot of HRF lately. The last two times I entered a nuked Whitesprings, its area extended past the train station, and the Scorched around there were dropping high radiation fluids most of the time.
---
That's why it would be a test server and not something you can bring back to the regular game.
---
That may be because people are actually completing events.
---
The way the public events work is that they are on some sort of rotation and timer.
---
Example, on a private server:
---
 uranium fever starts, you get 15 mins or so to start the event. You join and complete in 8 mins.
---
Then there is a cooldown, say 5 mins before the next event pops.
---
It's tea time. You have 15 mins to start. You do not join and it fails.
---
There is another 5 min. cooldown before the next event.
---
Whereas on a public server, there is a higher likelihood that people will a)join events quicker once they pop off and b) complete them faster with more people being there.
---
So new events are popping up more often in public.
---
psu issues most likely
---
had that happen to me as well when playing games no matter the load on my old corsair vs 450 replaced it with a seasonic prime ultra godl 550 watt and im golden
---
Yes, I'm monitoring all temps, including the graphic card.
---
I already checked for driver updates, wrong drivers, and possible le windows updates messing...
---
Event viewer shows nothing, pointing this is probably related to hardware somehow...
---
... maybe it's time to monitor voltages...
---
"Guess I'm over encumbered until tomorrow.." - me after a nuked white springs picking up every legendary every one would just drop on the ground.
---
I think it seems more abundant on public servers because people do the events, so it triggers another. But when I've been on a private server, we never really did an event except maybe Uranium Fever or Line in the Sand, so they'd just sit there until they expire
---
FWIW I had this same issue - as you described.
---
However - last night I before I could log in to test it out along with the Revolutionary Generals Outfit *(had same issues after I noticed Ranger coat) -* the launcher forgot the game was installed and I had to relocate the files and reinstall.
---
Once it was done doing the fake install &amp; then done a second scan &amp; repair afterwards - this issue disappeared for me fwiw.
---
YMMV but hopefully this helps everyone else.
---
Paying for in game furniture... Last 5 FO games and 3 scroll games, this would of been a comical idea. But here no modding, so you pay.
---
As cool as it would be to have it as a quest.   if history dictates it's gonna be a Atom Shop Skin.
---
Will do :)
---
it's possible. The PSU is not overloaded, but it's getting old.
---
I'd love to see it to put the "they've literally fixed nothing" crew in they're place.
---
And fix some day 1 players memories of what launch was like. 
---
This community has a lot of bold face liars in it when it comes to the subject.
---
How is it the consumer responsibility to know enough about game development to assume it would be patched out. Some people just pick up a game to play it without any knowledge of server stability etc. As usual Bethesda are making decisions without thinking first. They come off as complete amateurs.
---
I dropped a 3 star TSE lever action transferring it to another character and because I had the paint on it I lost it forever. Good times
---
Brill, thank you :) does stealth not suffer in PA?
---
yut enemies under the map
---
Note to self, on next camp redesign, add a hidden vendor with free stuff.
---
However I do not think that free enterprise is fucking someone. I am not poor. I can afford a few dollars and it does not change my life. You do not seem to understand that you are not forced to play the game. It is an option in life. There are a ton of games to chose from. I notice that you stand by the other players who will squeeze the last cap from a fellow player in order to get ahead in the game. If I remember correctly a cap is worth $1.87. I could be wrong it has been a while. The point is that while you get charged $18.00 for power armor paint, $38,400.00 for a quad... I am quite sure that you cannot comprehend the point being made. All the more sadder. I go to reddit to see if there is something new or a well thought out reason one may not be pleased with something. All I see is price check this
---
, and Bethesda is unfair that. I spend over 10 years in higher education. As I worked though 5 degrees I had to actually think. I needed to be able to be objective. I had to defend myself on my ideas by taking anywhere between 5 and 200 pages to explain my idea. However, on reddit one does not have to do that. They can just say “boo hoo, I don’t think it is fair that I should have to pay for something. I am a millennial and I am entitled to free things because I am a special snowflake that should get its own way. If I don’t them I am going to throw a fit.” When I do that, well shit, lets lynch this guy because he dared to tell the truth and he did it in the way we whine. Boo hoo, that’s not fair, I have my rights. How dare he present an opposing view. I’ll show him. I will downvote him because I have power and I’m not afraid to use it. Then I will rant and rave like an idiot because my flimsy budget cannot handle a whopping $8.99. Hey, should we start a Go Fund Me page so that you can afford Fallout First? You can go ahead and throw whatever at me, at least I know that I can actually think for myself and be subject to people like you. Like I am supposed to stop playing Fallout 76 because you are not happy about something.
---
The studio account also commented in here, but this is planned for the Wastelanders update. But since we know this is such a requested fix from the community, we're trying to pull it out of that patch and into a December patch without breaking anything. We'll let you know more when we do.
---
related _ it seems I get better hit/damage when in crouch. (disregarding sneak/covert), than a standing position. THis could be however , wishfull thinking, Games in the past worked that way - ALWAYS go prone when firing...... does vats not also come in to play with melle weapons as well ? , I dont use them much and can't quite remember.
---
If I see &gt;150 lvl workshop owner, there's a good chance he might come to defend and even bring some pals with him; especially in Ammo factory - that's basically official pvp ground by now.
---
Thank you for bringing this up! We've raised this internally.

No, you're right...it's the dense mod.
---
Keys are instanced to the player. You cannot stop another player from picking up keys by picking them up before them. 
---
So this is not at all a concern.
---
Man I have yet to see that. I occasionally get people that seek revenge, die a few times and give up. At this point I just go for whoever and occasionally snag a bounty
---
There were some bags dropped, chems and stuff like that, emotes, poses... All after half an hour of pretty vicious fight. It's refreshing when people are not jerks.
---
32,767, to be precise :)
---
What made me think of this idea was someone posting "the trailer for this game doesn't feel like the actual game," and then the top comment was "its seemed like it pvp was gonna play a bigger role." It's amazing people forget having your whole base being leveled by another player out of nowhere.
---
I hope they end up being cheaper than that. That's more expensive than recent bundles, with less content.
---
I want a 1911...
---
my strenth is 12 ( i think) servo has always done its job. (t51/60/ultra)
---
Me too
---
Well, it wasn't like this before,  not sure when they changed it.
---
ssshhhhttt dude, what are you doing?!
---
But why does it have to be either/or? You shouldn’t need to dedicate your entire team
---
to an expansion, unless you have a very small team.
---
You can go to the multiple places in toxic Valley and kill the scorched or super mutants that spawn and sell their weapons. Boom, caps.
---
There's only like three spawn locations for it. One in Clarksburg, cranberry bog ranger station and in the basement of that bed n breakfast place in Savage Divide. They don't drop off enemies and are always level 20 weapons :(
---
That's what everyone on here says, but it is a bug too apparently. I'm a peasant I know nothing :)
---
Oh man yes. And they went around in groups claiming each others wanted bounties. 
---
Getting killed afk by chip damage was always comical too.
---
Medics with vats perks, or a vampire's explosive
---
This game is full of darkness. 
---
A girl kills her own mother for people who kill her. 
---
The remnants of the government are wiped out by the AI that was supposed to help them. 
---
A man destroys the heavily populated (and untouched by nukes) Capitol city in order to avenge the death of his girlfriend which in Shakespearean tragic fashion, happens as a result of his actions. 
---
A city dies because the robots meant to make it a paradise are turned against them. 
---
Not to mention the plague that kills everyone else by making them part of s hive mind led by a giant radioactive bat. 
---
Yeah, it’s a real chucklefest alright.
---
So many words and you said nothing, lol. I don’t play this shitty game, so I have no idea what caps you’re talking about. You immediately made some kind of stupid assumption about me. I’m just here to call out shitty practices that plague games. I love games and monetization shouldn’t go beyond DLC’s that add lots of additional content, if that.
---
Yeah, that's very misleading
---
Ever since I got to a high enough level to play in nuke zones this has always been the case for me.
---
I keep stashing the glowing and hardened mass in case the ratio changes but it seems like it never will.
---
Fool ya once, shame on them. 
---
Fool ya twice, shame on you.  
---
Fool ya . . . how many times is it now? I mean, they're not even fooling you at the point. They've made it clearly evident, so now your choosing to willingly screw yourself.
---
Buy it. Complain it doesn't work as advertised. Get your atoms back. Then maybe they will stop doing this.
---
Santa Claws, the Christmas deathclaw
---
By all means, being skeptical is part of the human nature, but I also believe the only other posts I have on my reddit account are about building a new PC; which I mentioned in this post. 
---
I didn't ignore the issues, I mentioned that this subreddit is full of posts about the issues, so why should I keep advertising them if there are weekly, if not daily reminders about them. 
---
If the community hated the game, why would they still be playing it? Why would there be level 200+,  300+, 400+ characters running around the wasteland, helping other new players with their experience? 
---
If you also read the post, you would've seen that their answer wasn't "just buy a new card", but "Your CPU isn't compatible" even though it was compatible during the BETA. 
---
I appreciate your comment, but next time please read a little more than a few paragraphs.
---
This is what I did. Let's me heal health and rads and refill hunger and thirst for my whole team while still doing ok damage and being fairly tough. I use a t-60 armor cause I like it. I use a flamer for healing and a 50 cal for dps. You could take off philanthropist and use tenderizer instead for a bit more damage, but I like the full support package

I got it because it has regional pricing in my country that came to about $60, while on Bethesda store it was €60 which is way more in our currency.
---
Yes its dumb, most games say hey auto remove paint so it can be dropped but Bethesda just decides lets have it delete itself. Lost entire set of XO armor due to Tricentennial Paint Job.
---
Blueprinting dosen't work at all for power lines/conduits. It makes the whole thing not placeable.
---
Its based on a % over your character's maximum weight which is based on your SPECIALS. 
---
So look at the weight you are as you transition after death without armor,without perks. Whatever that number is is to high ( even without junk and extra weight ).    
---
For me, its 1,000 pounds on may 15 Str max character. As long as I"m under 1,000 total pounds with everything i carry, no perks, I can res anywhere, but even going to 1,001, I can only res at Vault 76.
---
Rule 6: Use descriptive titles when submitting a post. If the average user has to click on your post to understand the context, then it is not descriptive enough. If you're posting a question, put it in the title and give further information inside. Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.

It’s also possible that a Windows setting causes one to reset rather than go to BSOD.
---
the "game" is full of these little "errors"....

I am currently at level 299 and still have no desire to stop playing FO76. In fact, i have a nice daily routine in place and have been completing it since around level 220 or so. 
---
* My West-Tec loop.
---
* Sales to the Whitespring station for 1,400 caps.
---
* Scrip my unwanted legendary items and buy a 100 Scrip ranged weapon.
---
* Check my friends servers to see who doing a Queen.
---
* Keep my four vending machines stocked up.
---
* Buy/Sell/Trade on Reddit and Facebook.
---
It works for me quite well as I eagerly await Wastelanders.
---
Yeah this happens fairly frequently. Anyone I know with the previous Liberty Prime skin, myself included, stopped using it around a week after getting it. 
---
It overlaps the voice lines virtually every time I Fast Travel to Scorched Earth. On console the decibel level is so high the it often clips and just doesn’t sound that good. And they is no control of the voice module.
---
What does heart of the swamp have to do with radshield?   Had a hard time getting blooms lately.
---
I think the Devs had a total different vision for player interaction they wanted us to be hostile and hesitant to interact but they gave literally no reason to do this. Unbalanced fights not very often you kill someone and they have actually good amounts of junk(One of the good things about survival mode)  and the atomic store markets items that seem counterintuitive to the original game pitch we saw at E3.
---
I remember when this used to be a problem. Then all my friends got tired if the bugs a d quit playing. I seem the be the only one still hooked. I sorta miss having that problem..
---
Thankfully rust is coming to consoles next year so I can get the base building/raiding PvP experience I always hoped 76 would

The quests conclusion and overseers fate was saved for wastelanders. *Yeah*
---
OMG I would LOVE THIS!
---
I am far from an expert on SBQ fights, but from what I have gathered:
---
Dos: Try to cripple her wings (Shotgun with Enforcer perk is good for this - you only need to hit, not do any damage). Try to keep the summoned adds down. This isn't just the good, neighborly thing to do, but the bloodied melee players who are doing the bulk of the damage will die to a sneeze, so not keeping the adds down prolongs the fight because it lowers the total collective damage output.
---
Don'ts: Don't unnecessarily shoot her while she's flying - wastes ammo, doesn't do much damage due to the distance-based damage fall-off, and there are persistent rumors (which I can neither confirm nor deny) that staggering her in the air can reset her animations and keep her from landing. Don't stand on the fence - again, can't confirm or deny, but the theory is that if the SBQ targets you when you're standing on the fence or somewhere else she can't go to, she may take off, refuse to land or even bug out and fly away.
---
The most important fix is the one that stops my game from crashing when I open the pipboy after loading into a world
---
I'm not aware of that setting, though I'll admit it's been a few years since I was poking around at that level, it's certainly worth checking on.
---
Hmm. I don't really want to heal others rads because so many people use bloody builds. Other than that though that's pretty solid. Question though with strange in numbers that positive 25% mutations benefit, does that work with herd mentality? Would it give me +3 in special stats?

---
If you accidentally drop a weapon or armor with an atomic shop paint on it, it should strip the paint, not just completely destroy the item, but, alas, that is not the case.
---
Yeah, that pisses me off as well. The free wallpaper should have been classified with things like the terminal. I’m sure Bethesda would frame it as ‘just a reward to people still playing the game,’ but this limited time generosity would need to be far more frequent to keep people playing. As it is, they’re just pissing off those who’ve mostly quit, rather than tempting them back in with a growing list of new, free camp items.
---
I kind of miss the sense of danger every encounter with another player would bring.  The world now feels really safe in comparison.
---
the line between capitalism and extortion matters on the context..,
---
i did not argue or talk about bethesda being in the wrong in messing up a Series which they had both brought to a larger mass of players, but also lower it.., lower it down in terms of quality and players wants..,
---
this form was, and is always used by con artist all over.., and have been used to target indie devs out there.., not only in games, but also in other branches.., it would and could be seen as capitalism.., if it was similar to the case of the competing brands.., but this isnt a competing brand..,
---
asides the fact that you actually have not researched that he did plan to give it back to them.., on account that he acts as a mediator for the community.., which im sure at some point was mentioned before..,
---
(no one is capable enough to take that position.., when many people could of easily done the same as him..,)
---
it taints his image cause it puts him under the spot light of using the holes of the system(even though i never disagreed bethesda was not working their processors and brains at the time, when they did not get all of the possible domains..,)
---
it would be reasonable to use capitalism.., if it wasnt for the fact it goes along the lines of letting gray/dark marks get by if it benefits..,
---
not only, like i said before.., does it paint him bad.., but it puts many in dour moods.., *besides voices that reach farther than ours pretty much stated that the way this system was set up is reminiscent of ESO..,
---
not all Developers are free from their publishers..,
---
the kids story, as you say.., even though he aint a kid..,(a kid can be excuse for actions they take, but still have a ways to go in learning) took the domain.., and purposefully made those demands.., the stronger message would of been one of causing that.., and then returning..,
---
you keep using capitalism like there was a market trend.., the days will go on.., and all of this.., does not serve the gaming community well at all.., Bethesda for all its mistakes(by their development choices.., and those of the publisher) will keep going downwards.., and with that also goes the IPs..,
---
the story can revolve around as much as youd like to say that.., but if it never stops revolving.., they all it says is that many people out there in the gaming community will let things past, as long as what they wish for happens.., but the way things are going.., itll only spur those who wish to step on us all, and the image of gamers..,
---
Bethesda is already feeling it.., as in the developers.., if goes on like this.., theyll be the laughing stock.., and so will the IPs..,
---
they may change.., but the people who push these actions forwards wont..,
---
(bethesda if it was smart.., would just keep moving on.., accept the scar, and make better~fix~ of the mistakes.., but never, ever feed people like him..,)
---
at the very least, there are people who are willing to reasonably discuss..,(even though its clear this will be a agree to disagree.., cause so far, nothing that really tells me that this will make a change for the better for bethesda, or the IPs.., for the fans who enjoy the games.., and i have no reason given to change that view of their actions.., ~but obviously i wont be sitting on this hill, since i have things more important than discuss, and dont care if people pile -negatives cause they wish for release, and those around them to confirm bias, and trounce on those that dont)
---
in either case.., have a good day.., but please.., dont say buddy or goofy..,
---
i have someone i actually know call me and others Bud(dy)..,
---
and not once will i say someone else's words or position/ideals are goofy..,
---
(i only would point out the words they used.., and the lack of reason.., ~the words, not the person~)
---
the part of the community that wished to through their lot on one side chose to act in a way that paints gamers as capable of actions that hurt themselves as long as they feel like some change was done..,(when it did nothing)
---
and one guy who knew those who wanted something to relieve their disapproval even if it does negative in the end where there, waiting to be loud enough for sites to write an article about..,(which will again, be used against gamers)
---
but thats enough of things that go into other things..,
---
enjoy your time on the net.., or whatever you do on it..,
---
[Dont reply.., itll probably just keep going in circles..,]
---
maybe a bug only on excav - never modded that  on excav
---
We have two radios, one for classical and one for Appalachia radio, so why not the jukebox? Been wanting this forever...
---
But I also really want the jukebox from The Nukashine - the music in there is awesome, and makes a trip to see Biv even more entertaining.
---
Both. My fiance and i both play. That was our total tally. She never managed a full event on her pro
---
Ahaaaa yeah I thought as soon as you hit a target, blam dmg gets reduced. Will reach out to Scorpion and see what is actually going on, thank you!
---
Bottom line, it would be the passion for the series that drove me to enjoy it as much as I did, and I can't deny that. As a base game, you are completely right, it's pretty broken and a fairly awful game, but it honestly works a tad better than back in the BETA. 
---
I do believe that's actually where I'm a lot more lenient than most people though, I quite enjoy playing broken games as I've been rather active in the Alpha/Beta tests for games over the past years. I genuinely do feel bad that a lot of people have had the experience you've had, an unplayable pile of dung that Bethesda pooped out to simply "get something out there" after the excessive amount of hype and advertising. 
---
I will agree, I hate the direction all of this is going, the Atomic Shop is an absolute joke. The weekly updates which update nothing but fix the bugs Bethesda made in the previous patches. The constant maintenance of servers which seems to do absolutely nothing; Even the current patch that was just announced has three lines of performance issues and the rest is all cosmetic for the most part. Also, weeks upon weeks of a "free icon" in the Atomic Shop to simply salt the wound. An icon which takes their artists around 10 minutes to make on his lunch break. 
---
I'm not optimistic about Wastelanders, but I hope it'll be a re-vamp of the game. One can only hope that the game will go through something like Final Fantasy 14; Where they re-released the game after a shocking flop and it became one of the most popular MMOs, even to this day.
---
Yeah
---
youre downvoted but youre right
---
150 vault 94 steel is crazy
---
most of the vault 94 grind is the steel for the power armor
---
now any schmuck can do like 7-10 runs instead of 40 and get their power armor plans and craft it
---
Never thought I’d be inspired by a post about Fallout 76 lol, but I really vibe with this post. I played about 60 hours the first month of release, got to around level 65 then completely disconnected from the game until nuclear winter came out, which I toyed with for a few days. 
---
I recently got back into it a week ago. 
---
I’m level 113 now and have doubled my game time (yep, I’m a week, scary I know). 
---
Point being, your experience with this game is completely what you make of it!
---
You haven't seen the villager pillager trailer than.
---
People still play this trash?
---
SHHhhhhhh Don't talk to loud about holidays there could be TROLLs larking around and want scream hate. LOL
---
I agree though that would be awesome. I hope they don't disappoint with the Christmas event. I enjoyed the Halloween event.
---
And it totally needs to drop plans for a Deathclaw topiary with a Santa hat
---
Well you could take out rad sponge for tenderizer
---
That fear is what always makes me stop and read the messages. I never make those choices on auto-pilot.
---
Bingo. I've had good Whitespring runs where I'm getting HRF off of 50% of the mobs and it's still out of balance because the masses are dropping 3x.
---
They killed my pet mirelurk tommy wisseau and one keeps shooting my damn walls
---
And/or move three points from Charisma to Agility and max out Adrenaline
---
Now that I think about it, I should probably include the text of the email we received in case anyone missed the original thread on it:
---
Greetings,
---
We would like to apologize once again for any frustrations it may have caused you to lose your scrap after placing items into the Scrapbox shortly after Fallout 1st was released. This issue has since been resolved, but you’re still missing those items and we want to make this right.
---
While we can't restore exactly what you may have lost, we are going to add new scrappable objects to your inventory that will provide you with a wide variety scrap items in large amounts, based on rarity. This includes lots of common and uncommon scrap, as well as rarer items like Vault 94 Steel, Ultracite Scrap, Nuclear Material, Nuked Flora, and much more.
---
We are planning to grant four (4) of these objects, named "Scrap this at a Scrapbox" to your inventory within the next few days. As the name implies, be sure to use your Scrapbox to scrap these objects to avoid overencumbering your character. Please also keep in mind that they cannot be dropped, traded, or sold to vendors.
---
Thank you again for supporting Fallout 76 as a Fallout 1st member. We appreciate your patience while we've worked to address this issue. We hope this will help put you back on the right track to restoring your scrap collection. Please feel free to contact us again if you experience any issues with your scrap objects.
---
Warm Regards,
---
Bethesda Customer Support
---
Call it Krampus maybe. Make it a Deathclaw or a Sheepsquatch
---
if you say something goofy, you will be called goofy - no shame in that, just stop saying goofy things.
---
The guy is not in the wrong whatsoever, in the same way that if you're driving and need to take a turn, you dont wait until the last second when the turn is on you because there may well already be someone there. cant blame a guy for exploiting an opportunity. Finally please fix your grammar its rough to read
---
150 vault steel wtf
---
Is it too late to pretend I lost mine too
---
KRAMPUS the Sheepsquatch
---
SANTA-CLAWS the Deathclaw
---
600 vault steel is absolutely ridiculous
---
At least you still can lol.
---
There's no telling, but if I'm reading the datamine screencap correctly that is the amount in **1** of the bulk junk items.
---
I'm hoping what is in right now aren't final numbers.
---
because americans will pay that much and more, so bethesda doesnt care
---
It's a bit crazy that they're reimbursing people for potential lost junk with hours of free farming materials, yet people who lost hours of farming materials due to glitched characters get nothing. I guess that's their way of adding value to the subscription.
---
but not every 1st member gets the stuff. only the people loosing their stuff and writing a ticket.
---
In the last thread there were people who didn't send in a ticket that received the email.
---
It happens every time... must be some new definition of the word ‘inconsistent’ I’m unaware of
---
100% on board with this, can't equip frog legs due to my pve build.
---
You do understand that a company has to profit in order to continue doing business right?
---
There was a trailer that had a twirling blond with a big ass smile on her face spinning around shooting all the while The Beach Boys “Wouldn’t it be Nice” playing. 
---
Awesome live action trailer. Except we yet to have that dress she’s wearing or the cross chest bullet belts that she has over it. 
---
That kind of annoys me.
---
Don’t complain, Bethesda will put it back to normal.
---
I bought a new controller and it was fixed. HOWEVER did not notice this in other games... really weird
---
Bethesda: RemindMe! 5 months
---
Nice she stayed on the ground...
---
Beth is just on big open scummy company now fuck em. I might play again I might not but I will say I'll never give them more of my money.
---
It's easier to rage against me than for them to admit BGS stuck it in and broke it off.
---
Don't forget OP Two Shot weapons.
---
&gt;Vault Steel - 150
---
fucking what now? 13 days worth of steel assuming the person was even capable of expert on at least 2/3 of the missions. thats just shy of the __HUGE__ grind for the strangler set
---
Honestly, you only need to make it to level 30 or so. Just make sure that you put special points into the areas that you'll need for nuclear winter
---
Obvious Synth activity 😉
---
Holy smokes, wish I was getting this stuff. 
---
I guess they are in a lose lose situation.  If they ton it back, you will have people outraged that DID lose more than what they were given.
---
Did the people there lose mats though?
---
Maybe they have figured out a way to see who lots things with the bug, and are going by that list.  I'd be *very* surprised if they had that tech, AND bothered to look, but I've been surprised before.
---
Looks like this is another olllllllllld bug that resurfaced.  It's almost comical.
---
I haven't had it happen again yet, but I was at someone's camp last night where it was going on.
---
It isn't just events though, it is also group coordination when you have more than four people for anything.
---
I know. They'd still have to go through a few times on at least normal to get the plans, but there won't really be a *grind* like what has been necessary thus far.
---
It would be more simplistic to out an inventory cap on the number of each key that you can obtain.
---
What concerns me is that people who didn't even submit tickets got the email as well, myself included. I guess they can't keep full track of who all lost stuff and what, so they're going "fuck it all 1st members get junk" but...all of the stuff is just *way* too much. I can't play 76 for a few more days due to being out of town, but I really hope I don't get on next to find that I have all that bulk given to me. I'd much rather give it away for free to other people who need whatever junk as well
---
You cant as far as I know.
---
150 x 4, so 600.
---
I got the email.  I never supported a ticket and to my knowledge I never lost any materials in my scrapbox.
---
It doesn't affect anything. People were already doing this with mule characters and additional accounts enmasse. This changed nothing
---
As far as I've heard, it's going to be scorched dressed up as santa, Ms claws, and elves and they will be implementing a free loot box type thing that has 3 levels that has stuff in it as presents or something. Juicehead talked about it
---
But you’re sacrificing 1 of your 5 characters
---
Very
---
I certainly hope so. There has been data mined information interpreted differently than how it actually manifests in game. It's possible that's what's going on here and maybe those numbers are upper limits? 
---
Even if that is the case, a clarification here would do a lot to clear the confusion.
---
ive grinded out 2 sets of the PA and a few rerolls of solar, this is a HUGE slap to the face to any of us that take the time to run them.  (which according to the downvotes i get in raid threads, is not many people)
---
I hope they give it to everyone with a scrapbox, there will be people who didn't submit tickets, that and I just want all that vault steel.
---
Cool. Thanks for the input. I'll fiddle around with it when i get home.
---
Fallout 1st subscribers get **a lot** of junk, even if they just lost one screw in the scrapbox.
---
Players who lost *everything* when the Vault Raid was launched get the finger.
---
Now that's how you treat customers!
---
He said he reported it to them, he didn't say he was working "with" them or that he was sanctioned to do these things, unless I'm missing that somewhere?
---
I believe stealth does. If you run PA I would use Emergency Protocols.
---
This kind of random shit is the best part of the game.
---
Is the next vault opening soon?
---
That's the only place I've gotten prime, except for player vendors. Have yet to see the railway one from either source though.
---
I hang out on the east side of the map anyway since it has the most challenging creatures, and do all my trolling for legendary runs.  I never bother anyone unless they asked, but maybe this is a thing now.
---
I mean, I lost more Yellowcake flux than the amount I'd be getting back, but that's about the only rare resource I'd be at a net loss on. I imagine it is an exceedingly small portion of the player base that had that many resources on a single character just based on the weight of it back when we had to stash our junk.
---
I foolishly started consolidating the high value junk on my main character from my mules the day FO1st dropped. If they do go through with this though, I'd walk away with way more than I lost in value.
---
&gt;This is a "feel bad" solution that I really think should be reconsidered.
---
I'm not saying I agree or disagree with you, but I don't think they've ever reconsidered a decision with this game.  At least not between announcement and implementation.  
---
I think they're in a tight spot because of their own fuck-up and there really is no perfect solution here.  They shouldn't have made the mistake.  Now there's nothing to do but *something*.  
---
I'm honestly not sure how I feel about their approach here, so I'm not gonna comment on the specifics one way or the other.  I'm just kinda filled with conflicting points of view on it.  On the one hand, eh, give them a break.  They're in a no-win situation.  On the other hand, Bethesda, for fuck's sake you need to QC things better than you've been doing.  Slow down, get it right before it's released.
---
I frequent the Bog cuz there is no challenge anywhere else on the map. It sounds like you're doing a popular "run" of the area.
---
Not all 1st members are getting the email...I have first and did not get that email (granted I did not loose anything) it seems as though it is going to some who did not put in a ticket, but its not ALL.
---
I tried to solo sbq and everytime she flew off she regenerated health, must of happened 5-6 times before I gave up.
---
That mall in the mire that's full of scorched would be another possibility for something like this. It's a really cool location, but totally wasted because there's nothing to do there.
---
Will do :) thank you
---
I agree with regards to FFXIV (which today was revealed is getting a PS5 version). I wish 76 had a similar rebuilding like that game did. But sadly, despite what's happened with 76, it's probably still profitable for Bethesda. What with all the first subscribers and Atom purchasers. People don't care that the game is broken. They don't care that it isn't getting fixed. They think that by buying microtransactions, that money will fund Bethesda's ability to fix and complete this game. When in reality, you're just lining their pockets, giving them more and more money, so they have no reason to fix this game. You're already giving them your money.
---
I was talking to a buddy the other day. We were remembering when Battlefront 2 was having it's huge controversy, where EA was trying to monetize the shit out of it. Gamers banded together and flight against this shitty business practice, forcing EA to change what they were doing with that game. We wondered why a similar thing didn't happen with 76, when the release version of the game was near identical to the beta two weeks earlier (making the final version of the game, basically a $60 beta). When Bethesda did nothing for months to address any issues. How the microtransactions were there right from the start, from the beta, with no issues, and yet the game itself wasn't finished. Etc, etc. I felt this was an equally outrageous thing that a shitty company was doing, but no outrage from the community. IDK, maybe this community just doesn't have the will for it. Maybe they're apologists for Bethesda. Maybe they have very low standards. I don't know, I'm not calling anyone out, it's just an interesting conversation we had.
---
I (thankfully) didn't put my vault steel in because I was hording it for when they add unyielding to the legendary modifier list for the vault armors. This will give me an enormous leg up in that, especially since I can only play every other week which makes it hard to find a steady group to run on expert.
---
That's what I plan to do with a lot of it, but it would depress the prices of a ton of stuff and probably slightly increase the prevalence of vault armor.
---
I didn't lose anything either, nor did I put in a ticket, so I'm just really confused. Unless I did lose stuff and didn't notice, I'm just worried
---
No one knows right now. Supposedly they were gonna open it right after 94, but there were so many problems they held off. I dont know if that is true but...
---
How do I submit a ticket? I never got the email and lost some stuff? Disnt lose any fo steel but that's aside from the point. I just bought 20 dollars worth of atoms and am an annual sub so... regardless I would like some compensation too.
---
For me, being a 1st subscriber, I'm fine with this.  I dont have any jealousy or anger that your getting a bunch of scrap that I dont have.  If it was weapons/armour, that would be really diff.
---
I would just love to know test servers exist.
---
Congrats, that's awesome, but how has no one asked the most important question:
---
Did it count for the "Kill the Scorchbeast Queen" in the kill large creatures challenge??
---
I think it's a good solution that needs to be dialed back a bit. Just going off weight, that is more junk than the vast majority of players would've had total before FO1st dropped.
---
I don’t honestly know. I already beat that
---
Yeah it sucks when that happens. Enemies (including SBQ) will regenerate health when they exit combat. That's why in the video I'm chasing her around the area.
---
Well, now i wish my junk got deleted D:
---
Disagree, I thought the trailers did a good job of capturing the experience.  The first official trailer is mostly just high resolution scenery from the game with the occasional third person shot of someone walking whilst holding a gun, and the live action trailer shows a bunch of people walking around whilst shooting things.  So yeah, walking around with guns and shooting things, seems like a pretty accurate depiction of what we got.
---
There isn't any content other than events that require more than 4 players (most of it doesn't even need 4).  
---
If they want to add in factions/guilds or something of that nature that gives some of the benefits of being in a group (such as fast travel) great, but there is no good reason to change the existing group structure and all the work that has to be done to balance for it when there is no content (other than events) that rely on more than 4 people.
---
Actually, this looks pretty fair to what I lost.  I lost over 2000+ screws, 600+ ultracite, and 600+ violet flux and a bunch of other stuff that I don't remember.  I was really not happy and was worried that I wouldn't be compensated.  The only thing that set me off was the stable flux which is a pain to get with the change to hardened mass/fluid drops a few months back.
---
I think he means he already ranked up his NW character to level 90 and that he would be back at level 1 on NW if he started a new character.
---
Running through the glass cavern or whatever it's called is a great way to farm Ultracite and EXP. Maybe they were on the way to do that
---
It's basically free rolls on the vault armor, but I get what you're saying. I don't want this to be a hate post, I'm just concerned that it is not the best way to handle this and I know it will be one of those things certain people will pick up and run with. 
---
Getting any recompense for my lost junk would be appreciated, but this much is more than most characters would have total just because of the stash limit. Look at the weight of the flux alone. You would've had to move materials from a mule to your main and then lost them in the box for it to have been that big a loss.
---
honestly, if they took out the flux and vault steel, i wouldn't mind this (myself not being a 1st subscriber). but the fact that they ARE included is really frustrating.
---
Lol
---
You submit it on bethesda.net, though if they've already sent closing emails on the tickets for it you may not be able to get a response in time.
---
Made a post about it few days ago. I got downvoted to shit because it's "my fault for ignoring dialogue" then deleted my post.
---
100% this
---
I had a little less flux than that but Yellowcake. The southern part of the savage divide is absolutely full of it. I'll alternate bombs between a high mob density area for those mats, then pick raw yellowcake to my hearts content on the next one.
---
This is only my opinion do NOT hold me to it. However I'm high level (330 something) I run route 64 or whatever on the ride side of the map (the yellow main road) anyway I run it by myself, I might see 2 legendaries (not including scorchbeasts). When I take my lower level friends to level up they seem to spawn way more legendaries. There for with me, newbies get help lol.
---
In all reality though it's probably because it's hairy and your low level and they wanna help.
---
Also any help in Fort Defiance is purely coincidental more then likely, high levels go in there for the dresses or to pick up straight jackets for sale at vendors. I run fort defiance atleast 10 times a day in the hope of finding Big Red and I clear it of enemies every time. If there is a low level and I find a legendary I usually emote them to come to me for it or bring it to them etc.
---
We're just a friendly bunch to be honest after my small novel here lol.
---
Yup just came off a Scorched Earth event and I swear all the mobs went after me. I had to fight off two deathclaws, a yao gaui, 10+ scorched champions/warriors, 2 mirklurk king, and an assortment of scorched insects.
---
Yeah like everyone can just complete the raids...
---
This, it really needs to be a thing. Connecting these two modes made no sense at all
---
i think the only possible explanation would be "some guy who worked in the government and saw LP's design decided to make some crappy decorative metal plating for power armor (decorative because, in 76, it's treated as a paint and doesn't change stats) to look like it, and also swiped a copy of the voice box."
---
otherwise, i think it can be considered non-canon, but harmless.
---
The point is ridiculous. They are not even the same people.
---
silence
---
Most people can complete it on normal with a group if they're above level 50.
---
How do you paint you weapons?  Id love a pink Deathclaw gauntlet
---
lots of everyone in the bog now, since legend s/beasts are all over it, so if they 'think' youve got one, the'll come running. I don't mind, so long as they don't sit on the side lines, let me do all the work, put ONE shot in, to claim the reward.
---
but there is......... 'wonder if this player needs/wants a hand'............ one way to find out. especially if they lower level.
---
Dammit, i fucked that up. 
---
It was faster reload speed, there is a glitch where your fire rate doubles when you have 1 bullet left and you can shoot and reload twice as as as normal. The " Bloody Explosive Faster Reload" is the rarest of bloody levers and in the trade groups I played with It matched the prices of legacies and qaud ffr faster r re load teslas.
---
Ps. If any of my crisom caravan brothers, or Appalachia couriers sees this ill be back soon &lt;/3
---
Just because it happens for you doesn't mean it happens for every one.  I know one person who doesn't seem to have this issue, although I do.
---
For all I know, it might have something to do with whether or not the cores are fresh, or if they've respawned after a previous run.
---
It’s not that these people are morons. It’s that they have a certain amount of wealth where $18 doesn’t mean that much to them. I have no issue with these people spending their money how they want. I do have an issue with Bethesda choosing to appease this demographic at the cost of the quality of their own game. Whether they mean it or not, these actions show that Bethesda value wealthier people in general than just the ordinary consumer. These companies almost have a destain for the poor. The evidence isn’t in the business model itself, it’s in the lack of response or justification for these crazy prices. It’s also in next years e3 where they’ll wheel out the devs with the biggest smiles to tell us how we’re one big happy family and how they ‘respect’ their communities. It’s real disgusting. But I have nothing against anyone wanting to spend money how they want. If Bethesda are that weak in the face or capitalist pressure then that means they’ve chosen that venture over an artistic one. Of course with any company there has to be a balance, but I see no balance here.
---
Hum... no, no they cant... thats why you see almost 0 people using Vault Raid armor... Besides most people think the raid is a waste of resources, sadly...
---
once my broken missile turret kept shooting my own camp...
---
Scrap bullets to make the bullet types you need or allowed to sell bulk bullets
---
You didn't pay for vault raids though did you?
---
Not at all. My NW main is a solid commando build in ADV. I dumped a V FFR handmade, and all my weightless sentinal armor from my main on this character.

Well, without all of the best legendary modifiers the two normal vault armors are kinda trash, and I see a fair number of players in the strangler heart PA.
---
Submitted a ticket asking for a refund of both bundles, showed my picture of both fog machines in use. Casually mentioned I'm a F1ster. Let's see if I get my atoms back
---
oh thx m8
---
Crickets..lol
---
Same, they shot my Collectron. I guess they hate P2W item, too. (I didn’t buy it, I grinded for it and had zero fun getting it)
---
So when are we getting fixes for issues such as;
---
-Lagging around all the time.
---
-Enemies warpinf around.
---
-Enemies randomly don't take damage.
---
-Enemies randomly damage me without doing their attack animation.

-Sound glitches, like my friend fires her gun and when she goes to reload, the sound of it firing doesn't stop, so I just hear shooting whenever I'm near her.
---
-Game freezing and lockups when I try to open the map or go to my Pip-Boy or use an item.
---
-Quests disappearing from my quest log, they don't show up unless I reset the game.
---
-I kill an enemy and it's corpse disappears so I can't loot it, or the corpse doesn't disappear and instead just has no loot at all.
---
-My friend removing quests from her list, but they don't disappear from my screen.
---
-My little doggie bag not appearing after I die and respawn so I lose all my scrap.
---
-Fast Travel just not working. It starts to count down and then stops and I can't fast travel. I had to walk from Whitesprings to Glassed Cavern recently because fast travel didn't work.
---
-Quest markers being in the wrong location or not appearing at all.
---
-I die and when I try to respawn, all the location markers have disappeared so I have to reset the game.
---
-Being on a crafting table and when I quit out of the crafting, it puts me right back in so I have to just keep trying to leave until it lets me.
---
-Getting disconnected from the server, this happens AT LEAST once per gameplay session.
---
I can go on, I definitely didn't mention everything, but all these things, I've encountered in the past week!
---
What do you mean? In game yes they are, same goes for irl. Your character looks the exact same not to mention your perk points, as well as atomic shop stuff. You might be thinking that these are the people from the holotapes, but they aren’t. When you play NW you are your character. Sure it doesn’t work with the lore, but neither does the constant disappearing nuclear fire surrounding several areas around Appalachia, multiple times, with just enough people surviving every storm for ZAX’s test, not to mention how they die and come back constantly.
---
Wtf is vault 94 steel
---
Really? Never saw 1 in Europe Server
---
.. Only saw 1 guy with the mask. I play 5h a Day
---
A material needed to construct the new vault armors.
---
Inbar the exact opposite experience with their convention deal with bonus atoms+ outfit thingy. 
---
Didn't show up after I purchased it. Called. Issue was resolved shortly after.
---
Huh, what platform I wonder?
---
This will absolutely make fo1st p2w if yall get fucking 600 steel!
---
I think what's more important is the obvious value they place on 1st subscribers.  This is a way to 'please' even those not affected by the glitch.  Many will angrily see this as pay to get support issue.  They need to throw some love at the non-1st players with a their own unlimited junk stash even if it's a ATOM purchase.
---
Exactly, you did what you’re suppose to, make your adventure build work with NW, however move 5 points to endurance for fireproof and adumantium skeleton
---
r/HydroHomies
---
They already had it figured out. The oversight is having both fog machines in the same catergory and then not changing the allowed amounts. Before, they were separate categories and both said 0/1. Now they combined them and didn't change that 0/1 to 0/2
---
Did you pay for all the scrap you will get?
---
I agree, though some would argue you still have to clear it on normal a few times for the plans so its "only a convenience feature" /s
---
PS4, how about you?
---
Did it delete your characters? Or gear?
---
i just made a new character for that game mode, since all rewards are linked to the Atomic Shop, and can be used on other characters
---
You should just be able to call. 
---
I had an issue when I purchased one of their limited +atoms + outfits atom bundles. Quick call. Fixed almost immediately
---
kind of a flaw in the pvp system when it comes down to who can first shot with an explosive weapon.
---
but people put in hundreds of hours to earn the steel, that people who never ran it will just be given
---
At least you still have 700. The first time I got the quest it deleted all but 5 of the 100 or so I had...
---
My head-canon is that it was a prototyping experiment with AI, basically an early test model of it along the same vein as the Prototype medic power armor but with less features at the time of completion. Likely got sidelined cause of that whole "end-of-the-world" thing.  
---
But that's just me making up a story as to why I have a jingoist lunatic/patriot with me at all times.  
---
There's no basis in canon for this at this time.
---
Nope, it isn’t canon. Simple as that.

---
How about those of us who took a workshop, built it up, and the server crashed.
---
Looks like some Bethesda employees are downvoting everybody.
---
lol they didn't fool anybody with this, it was a simple oversight on their part. They weren't trying to take away fog machines, they combined them in the build menu. Both machines said 0/1 before, but when they combined the entries they didn't change the number allowed to 0/2
---
I feel the same, maybe morons is the wrong word. I don't care how people want to spend their money, I hate that Bethesda appeases to the microtransactions crowd, more than they want to fix their game. I disagree with buying any microtransactions and rewarding Bethesda for their shitty business practices, but people are gonna buy what they wanna buy.
---
Not lore friendly
---
This is awesome. Thanks for taking the time to locate it!
---
200 plastic is not alot you can get that from Monster mash to name just one place
---
Nope no lore. The games a bit light on lore outside the main story. I'd of liked to know a bit more about the purveyor for example.
---
Microsoft should also give you the option to refund the purchases.
---
Why single out explosive weapons? If anything I prefer when they’re used, especially when I have a bounty since it gives me more of a heads up to react
---
Yes, I closed with that point in my rambling post.  This did fix it, thankfully.
---
I agree that event rewards could be better. Getting 2 rad away and 12 556 is hardly worth it, the rare rewards you can get from the coat are just far to rare (i'm looking at you leather coat). However the events are repeatable so we can't be getting to much.  
---
As far as #1. You just need to slow down and spend time collecting resources, the Story isn't something you can charge through. If you need caps kill and collect weapons to sell. If you need ammo spend some time with a melee weapon collecting materials. If you need aid your best bet is to scavenge or do events.  
---
The backpack is a skin and you need unlock the backpack itself through the questline.
---
Yeah that seems to be a concern.  If you end up getting the bulked stuff, OP's issue may actually be a thing.
---
I don't use explosives on this character, so dense mods are all i need, I can take 1 rank of FP for 15% vs scorchbeast attacks as needed. Admantium never seemed a worthwhile perk for me, as popping a stimpack removes any cripples. I'd much rather use those for dmg mitigations or boosts.
---
Agreed, combined with some of the in-game music (not radio) I used to find it a bit depressing when first playing lol.  
---
(first fallout game)
---
Xbox and American servers. I'm usually looking for extra spots on vault raids for expert in the LFG tab so maybe that's why I'm seeing it a lot. 
---
It seems like there have been fewer LFG posts since word got out that the Solar and Thorn armors don't have unyielding.
---
Hmm..this is an interesting theory and could be in play. I have two turrets with line of sight of one another. They were firing on a wolf and maybe the streams got crossed. NEVER CROSS THE STREAMS! It would be bad.
---
Yikes!! Well, at least it is rare and not really harmful. A nuisance to be listening to all that racket going on outside my house though! "Hey Kids, get off my lawn!" (waving fist in air)
---
There's a bigger issue that hasn't been spoken of, but I hesitate to spell it out...these items are effectively bound to the character, but if there's a way around that...they could get into the hand of people who would do things with them that would cause more serious problems.
---
Yeah I bought those bundles just to have billowing smoke coming out of the entrance of my camp. The issue is they combined them into one catergory. They didn't change the number allowed to reflect they were different types. So it still says 1 allowed when they should have changed it to 2 allowed. Just laziness and oversight on the part of whoever fixed it
---
!Remindme2Months
---
im not OP, but on xbox i have seen 1 other person who is not in any of my raid groups with any of the armor sets, and none that are not in one of my groups with an expert mask
---
R91 rifle is my favourite rifle in fallout. I would jump back in if it ever came out. I might even pay for it.
---
Refunds take time and money whether they’re granted or not. If they’re gonna hit us in our wallets, we should hit them in theirs. Keep asking for refunds.
---
We have no idea what can and can't be done, since we don't have access to our own servers.  
---
They did lie about scrap and performance for a year in a row.
---
Since you wanna be reminded I'll let you know how the email goes
---
hahaha! Yes, those Whitesprings Resort shrubs really made me lose my sense of immersion. Had to rage quit each time I noticed. 
---
...said no one ever.
---
That’s still sounds pretty cool I hope there’s a scorchbeast named Rudolph or something. Juicehead makes great news video on 76 I’ll have to check that video out later!
---
I think you can sell them for caps at vendors.
---
Both have happened according to a number of posts I've seen over the months.  Some vault related, others not.
---
Don't keys weigh nothing? Like treasure maps.  So what does it matter how many you carry?
---
But if that's a problem that needs fixed for some reason I'm missing just make them like plans...so they tell you you already have it.
---
Just a reminder Bethesda lied about everything since launch.
---
Corrected that for you.
---
I understand. And I also wish their monetisation system wasnt so successful. But before I blame any consumer I’m going to blame Bethesda first. Loads of companies out there make good money and continue to create good games. This behaviour from Bethesda isn’t an inevitability due to the game they created, it’s a choice and a bad one. There are so many more smarter ways to make money from this game rather then selling power armour paint for $18. It’s fucking lazy
---
Some method to flag junk items in your stash as "unscrappable" would have been nice. I lost several mothman wings and deathclaw hides to stupid clothing craft/sell cycling.
---
Hot keys? We have this awkward “wheel of death” as every time I seem to desperately need it I die as an trying to access that wheel!
---
Your back pack issue is because you likely purchased skins. This is not a bug. You need to do the tadpole quests to get the backpack to skin it. It's just like any other skin in the atom shop. Need the item in game to skin it. 
---
As far as mobs being to high level? Your best bet is to wander back into a level appropriate area, knock out some side quests, workshops, events and explore. 
---
Caps are a bit stingy at the 20/30s.  4 pts in charisma to get the better vendor prices can help, then just load up on dropped weapons and Chris and sell em at white springs. Should have a decent chunk pretty quickly.
---
hey so just a fyi, you can actually pause the jukebox to get endless ghoul spawns, including crowned ones.
---
Posting anything gets downvoted here lol. Some downvote because they think "F this person with a subscription" some downvote because they think "F fo76"
---
I wouldn’t go *that* far, but they are getting increasingly scummy.
---
The only thing really bound is the vault steel. Are you worried about the strangler heart lag going up?
---
Yes. Weren't you around when the Raids launched or what?
---
Even though it's already been said pretty much;  
---
High levels are joining you, not because you're low, but because you're in the Cranberry Bog.  
---
  The map scales in difficulty from left to right, with Cranberry Bog having the toughest, highest level enemies.  
---
Hope this helps!
---
It's a skin, for the tadpole backpack. They all are. The small backpack from early game doesn't work with them.
---
The quests you need to do are started in the more I believe.... Near the toxic lake thing.
---
Loot every enemy you kill as you stroll across the wasteland. Sell the spoils or scrap the weapons and armor to learn mods. Outfits you pick up aren't worth scrapping except for the Atoms; they are worth decent caps. There are a few things that are worth crafting to sell like marine helmets and Civil War outfits. 
---
This isn't a 40-hour game.
---
more than likely they are loading into the server around the same time as you.  only one way to find out. get a mic and ask them
---
In the old days the most you could get was 4-5 workshops before you crashed the server. Must've done it dozens of times
---
this means my change smoker machines will be at the same spot FOREVER....
---
Love it
---
Your vault 76 character is absolutely not the same character in vault 51.
---
You share the same stats, you share the same look, but they are not the same person. You are 100% correct that it doesn't make any sense in the lore, and why they should absolutely be seperated.
---
underground enemies attacking your camp
---
"Well we can't increase your stash space... but we can *sell* to you infinite scrap space!"
---
What a joke.
---
Dont know, what I know is most People wont even go near the raid... Which is sad since is the only endgame thing...
---
Do you want my copy/paste of what all you missed? It doesn't give all the quality of life changes or go into the two "dungeons" they changed the layout of, just the new additions. Some people find it helpful
---
You might think you're bored of killing weak players until you get killed by someone with strangler heart power armor, lmao.
---
it would be useful to post the source where bethesda people actually said that
---
Been here since the start. As far as I'm aware very few cases were brought up about deletion of characters (even fewer came with evidence). But as is and always will be with this game, mountain out of molerat hills.
---
id say the feedback was more responsible, so they probably ended up reworking it, because "fuck timers, fuck puzzles, etc"
---
Not the fucking point, this is arguably the only endgame content and the most tedious part about it is being given away on a silver platter. Running standard for plans is nothing compared to the steel grind. If this goes through fo1st will ABSOLUTELY have become pay to win, because you're winning the best pa in the game for a slight inconvienece that I bet most people didnt experience.
---
The series used to be much more of a mix of two dynamics.  It was the really bleak, dark, depressing side juxtaposed with the happy 50s music and the humor.  The combination of the two extreme elements, in that post-apocalyptic setting, is a large part of what made Fallout feel like Fallout.
---
You had a lot of fans who were suspecting a dark survival game who were surprised by this blend of things, and the word of mouth traveled about how the series was actually funny and kinda *cute* in a way despite the setting and tone.
---
I suspect that what has happened over the years, Bethesda fell in love with that reaction but misinterpreted it a bit.  The Fallout humor and light-heartedness worked because it was contrasted with the bleak despair that permeated everywhere.  Just play through *Fallout 3* and see what I mean.  
---
So they took all of the praise for the wacky elements, incorporated them more into the games, and toned down the horrors of war a bit.  You could see it in Fallout 4, you can see it in the marketing, and now in Appalachia you see it even more.  The game is so colorful outside of the Ash Heap.  The dark despair of the game is mostly contained to holotape recordings.  It did feel lonelier than the other Fallout games at first, unless you played with friends, but now with everyone's camp markers everywhere it always feels to me like you're in a world that's bustling with thriving human life.
---
I would like to see them go back to the Fallout 3 feel.  Less on the cutesy stuff, more on a note of desolation and hopelessness.
---
Sure, give me a sec
---
maybee the dailies were set up for wasteland. they didn't change it back is what it looks like then.
---
It sounds like they're sending it to FO1st members who played during the period it was bugged.
---

Gotta love those Bethesda Disciples.
---
Considering the bug only affected 1st subscribers, why would it have any relevance to *non*-1st subscribers, exactly?
---
I play 1-3 games every day, the events aren't all crammed together but nice try to paint your own narrative.
---
The bulk items themselves are bound...I'm sure I read that somewhere.  That's the concern.
---
If, say, several thousand of those bulk items began popping up, we'd have some very serious problems.  More so than just 1st members having some they didn't earn.
---
Totally, and that’s a cool idea, but I enjoy only having one character that gains all the NW xp, and adventure mode bonus NW XP. I don’t really have need of a mule or toon character. So, uncoupling the SPECIAL points would be most helpful for players like myself.
---
Sadly, but i can still dream!
---
Provided content maybe, but that isn't the end all of content in this game. For example I used to run an arcade where 5-7 people would show up for nuka-tapper tournaments. The ability to get everyone in one group would have made all our lives easier.
---
You are talking to the two people who lost their character?
---
The original I figured was created along the Captain America train of thought...something overly patriotic, bright and shiny, to put on to stage flex and show off. In an attempt to drum up support for the troops or sell the good ol warbonds
---
Well it is easier to remember your scrap then your 150 difrent modded weapons and another 400 modded armor pieces....
---
no free rolls on vault armor.  you have to do the quest on hard to get the plans to even make a piece of gear.
---
I can bring some info, yesterday i farmed nuked whitespring with 4 characters on a private world, 3 of them had a 3/2/1 ratio of Glowing Mass, Hardened Mass and last, High Radiation Fluids, only 1 character ended with 3/1/2 and everyone had close to or more than 60 Glowing Blood.
---
(it was aprox +30 Glowing Mass, between 25 Hardened Mass and just about 12 High Radiation Fluids, the last character had +30 Glowing Mass, only 11 Hardened Mass and a whooping 18 High Rad Fluid wich is still low compared to the other ingredients)
---
How many reported cases were there of people in the vault raids losing everything? I only saw two, and the 2nd was due to them trying to reproduce the bug that affected the 1st.
---
I haven’t played much lately. Got in when they had the double xp but I’m getting tired of the non sense. I want more stash space and was very disappointed with the Halloween event because they were giving out items like the resort plans and whitespring jumpsuit. It was an event, they should’ve given out new plans and shouldn’t have included anything at all that could’ve previously gotten in game.
---
Here's your daily reminder that it also came with an outfit, 1600 Atom's, a private world and a camping tent.
---
yut I'm a 1st and no email here
---
Let them fight!
---
I feel like it’s a conspiracy
---
It was a problem recognized by Bethesda. Don't try to make it sound less important than it is. I've seen even less reports of people losing their junk.
---
We lost hours and hours of leveling, grinding and gearing up a character. You lost two fucking screws and one adhesive.
---
if we were to get a christmas deathclaw, it should be named after ESO's

I had a post topic about this yesterday as well and have seen a few other topics crop up with the same story. I don't think mine were damaging anything though? Do you have pacifist mode on? I do and I wonder if that was why nothing in my CAMP was being damaged because it was unleashing hell all over my Collectron, my house structure, etc.
---
Lemme know how that refund goes. If it's simple oversight they may just say it'll be fixed in future updates.
---
Yeah they seem to do this a lot. They were really setting up for everything to be released with Wastelanders and seem to have forgotten all the other things in game tied to it when they pushed it back.
---
Even if they were two, which isn't the case, they don't deserve justice too? Why?
---
I've seen even less cases of people losing their junk, and they are giving away *tons* of it to people who didn't even lose anything.
---
That's the way it apparently is I'm afraid.
---
What i have a problem with that twice i have been told that Bethesda can\`t modify players characters/inventory but this prove they can which means there is either a misunderstanding or they have been lying to me
---
My 2nd failed run was a shitshow because I couldn't get her to stay on the ground so I switched to the Gatling Laser for the video.
---
When she lands on the ground then immediately launches off - I **hate** that.
---
I would be happy if I could just destroy extra keys. Way back in the early days there was a spawn bug with one of the quest keys and I picked up 50 as one stack. Luckily they have no weight but its always annoyed me that I have 50 of them. Now the alpha and beta keys from battle bot are collecting in my inventory since the event kinda forces me to pick them up to trigger the next step. 
---
I tried getting max weight then dropping them but still wouldn't allow me to destroy them. It's really just a visual thing for me. The battle not keys do not stack so it's making my misc. List super long.
---
Though mean damage resistance and not damage output,  correct?
---
I lost my character. And I'm not one of those two.
---
You are one of those who think that this sub is the whole playerbase?
---
Yeah no problem, I'll update the thread with it. In ESO when I had an issue they let me keep it and still refunded my crowns when I had a problem. It's all the same customer service so maaaaybe they'll do that here too but doubtful
---
Combined with a vietnam-style metal helmet already in game that'd be nice!
---
It used to be Hardened Mass, but was changed to Fluids a long time ago. They are toying with the Grind-settings.
---
I’m talking purely hp value
---
If only everyone played on the exact same machine... this game would run like a sports car.
---
That’s amazing, you must be an accountant 👍🏻
---
Yea good ones rip
---
Yes, much better!
---
Just your daily reminder that there's no difference between 1 Steel Scrap and 100, but 100 unique weapons/armor might just be a teeny, tiny bit more expensive to store and process. 😋
---
Yeah I try but a lot of low levels don’t get that &amp; keep turning it back on or playing instruments killing my ghoul slaying fun times.
---
You ask for too much... you will get a Xmas bundle of last years items in the atom shop.
---
Ok now that is way to much, i guarantee half of the people lost like a few ultracite or flux and said hey give me it back but they are like "ya know what? Lets completely say screw you to everyone else and give you 1000x the amount of what you shouldve gotten"
---
Yeah, seen that myself, wth tease?!
---
"Some of you who were disappointed..."
---
Was anyone here *not* disappointed?
---
So the fact that the scrap box isn't having to be intanced at over 200 location on the map and only in 2 spot is a big deal for server stability it requires a lot of shotty coding plus the 200 plus locations have to instance for each person
---
That’s not exactly what I meant, I apologize for not being clear. What I’m trying to say is Bethesda sold us a feature they said they couldn’t do because of server stability. Also, the tent shouldn’t be behind Fallout 1st either imo.
---
I did not submit a ticket for this, but I received an email related to this.
---
Easier for who to remember?
---
This is entirely false. Some people who lost their junk are getting these items. Some who didn't also are. It's not a blanket wide hey everyone who has fo1st gets this. People did lose vault steel as I know multiple people who did.
---
Here's to hoping!
---
Making a guess for what your activity was, why do you need to be in a group rather than using local area chat or even a third party chat application (like Discord) or Parties on PS4
---
Really cool to have player created content, but I still don't feel its worth the energy for them to restructure and reprogram the game to accomodate groups larger than 4, not when we have other bugs and issues that need to be resolved first, or other content that would likely be more usable by a larger selection of players (people who group in varying sizes).
---
And the solution is to add infinite scrap space... if you pay!
---
Idk, sounds like it should have been a basic feature.
---
Exactly.
---
I hate when people attempt to defend it by saying "uhhh it's optional you don't have to buy it" And there is the point flying over your stupid brain for the 274th time.
---
The fact of the matter is the atomic shop is an absolute joke, and it's sad. Just do paid dlc if you're going to release even simple cosmetics at such a ridiculous price. Like holy shit.
---
I mean I can slap my wallet down on the table and ask for an exclusive $1000 dollar skin that no one else can ever get, but is it something you wish to condone, a dev shamelessly whoring out awful content for exorbitant prices rather than focusing on the majority of the player base?
---
Yeah, there's always someone richer than me. My IQ is mildly above the temperature of the room. Its principal and practicality, not technicality.
---
There was a time when I was halfway convinced the Purveyor was actually the Overseer.
---
Lets hope once they see the bad sale numbers on the PA and the quantity of sales from the display shelf they stop with the dumb recolors from ESO and star selling more utility reskins (if only the fridge and protectron where in game :c)... the Prime PA sold a lot cuz it was new with added features, it must have sold quite a bit, must be the reason why they tought a recolor was what we wanted... wich is not.
---
Not false, no. You just chose a wrong interpretation of my post.
---
Jesus how long are you going to complain? Or is this just a pathetic karma begging because “Bathesda bad”  Move on with your life.
---
You have to defend the friendly deathsantaclaw and his herd of radstags from krampucquatch! 😃
---
That would be quite a twist! I'd just like to know why she is non-hostile unlike every other mole man.
---
I love that people are shocked when this company screws its customers.  Its cute.
---
No, but presumably you are only talking to people on the sub. 
---
And why do you say “according to me”? I never said that. All I said is the problem you are describing was incredibly rare and difficult to replicate. Basically 2 people were impacted. You should DM the other person.
---
I claim a workshop every time I log on. I get resources, and when you get it, you get a bunch of nice stuff. And everytime it’s attacked by mobs you beat them and get more. That plus my two small purifiers that I collect from any time I travel to my base keeps me at 40-50 water on me always. Speed demon never an issue
---
'Brand Ambassadors' apparently are immune to disappointment and always filled with a eerie sense of glee no matter how dire the circumstances.
---
Ten?
---
Or a key shotting gun (?) like a smaller junk jet xD
---
I almost feel sorry for them. They can't handle the game anymore. Don't know how to fix it, can't do it, they make the mob angry, they couldn't even get the canvas bags right. Every patch creates new issues. Every new thing conflicts against something already in the game.
---
Maybe the project was too ambitious, maybe they cut expenses way too much, maybe, maybe, maybe... 
---
Are they going to do the same with the next Skyrim?
---
I just checked your post history. You would defend Bethesda even if they removed the game from your system and made you pay full AAA price to play it again.
---
No point in discussing with someone who will resort to lies as much as you do.
---
Good talk.
---
I would like to know too. Any time you're submitting a ticket, changing focus away from the browser tab sends you back to the beginning. Has caused much frustration.
---
Again... no. What did I say that was a lie?
---
Yeah, I'm just talking to one in another thread. So much cringe.
---
Actually yes. Due to Bethesda being unable to get info on what junk was lost a blanket wide everyone who lost junk gets this is the only way to resolve it. Some People lost 10s of thousands of junk that they farmed and you're complaining that they are getting vault steel. What about the people who lost vault steel then huh? Why don't you try actually having respect for people who got caught up in a bug instead of complaining about something that is trivial. If you lost a character when the vault stuff happened and didn't make a ticket that's your own fault. If you didn't follow up on that ticket that is also your own fault.
---
I'm not defending it, but I don't think a major bug affecting just a few people will get the same attention a moderate bug affecting a large number of people will.
---
For your character file... you can only have Lead and then an associated number to Lead. It is the same to know you have 200x Lead or 1x Lead... but if you could have Green Lead, Green Lead with Moss, Red Lead, Red Lead with Thislte fuit and then an number attacheted to it your character file would be a mess... 
---
Resume: Your junk is limited in options therefore can have unlimited numbers, your armor and weapons have too much variety for tha game to load them out for 20 other player.
---
It clearly won't, yeah. Totally unfair, but it is what it is. I guess we should have paid for those Raids.
---
So be the change you want to see ;)
---
Got my gear back after google searching richard vogel and harassing him
---
There were times the server crashed multiple times in a row after claiming a single workshop...
---
Nice deflection
---
No point in arguing with a shill. You won't understand.
---
Have a nice day!
---
Todd Howard is literally Dick Cheney
---
Did you run the Scan and Repair utility from the Beth launcher?  One of my teammates last night was CTDing when he would enter the game.  He ran Scan and Repair and problem was solved.
---
There really is no other option for them in order to compensate players. They don't have the info because from what I can tell the records were deleted when the bug happened. It's either this or nothing and since some people did lose vault steel it makes sense
---
There’s no correct answer. No communication people complain. Communication people complain.  
---
Guessing the people communicating are not the developers. Don’t kill the messenger
---
YOU WIN!
---
Yeah four to five was best case scenario, it crashed before that plenty
---
So the Wastelanders launch is very ambitious, but with so much new content and bug fixes, we all know it's going to be on fire out of the gate.  Test servers sure would help with that.
---
I don’t care about Karma, I care about Fallout and want to see this game improve. In my opinion, putting basic/suggested features that affect the gameplay behind paywalls and/or the atomic shop makes the game worse. As for when I’ll stop complaining, whenever Bethesda stops doing this shit.
---
Dude these skins need to come with a switch to turn the voice off. Singlehandedly the biggest immersion breaker in the game, especially when multiple people are wearing the suit
---
We just got caught up in the routine. Once you hit endgame, it's just: log in, check a couple of player vendors, do a couple of legendary runs, maybe a couple of events... oh well, nothing else to do. See you tomorrow, Wasteland!
---
So if I can have unlimited numbers of junk, why should I have to pay to be able to do that?
---
Lol. You are completely out of your mind. 
---
Virtual items don't just magically appear. Someone took the time to make them. They didn't just pop out of the aether with a price tag. 
---
By that thought all e-books or digital music shouldn't be sold either since no tangible product was created.
---
Yep. Good to see they went back to what they promised with inside the vaults
---
We need a LOL emote and CRYING emote 2. I would use them all the time. 😉
---
Holy shit
---
OP, desperately trying to be recognized in the next YongYea video.
---
Go read my previous posts asshole. You act like I'm a shill yet I've had to deal with the fucking customer service not doing a damn thing while I sat here for 13 days basically harassing them so I could get my account back. I missed the entirety of the Halloween event, all the atom shop stuff, and the nw rewards due to that. Your response when someone gives you an actual answer is to call them a shill for supporting a game that they actually enjoy is fucking stupid and majorly disrespectful.
---
I got First from day 1 and had no lost junk nor email received.
---
Yup, sounds like too much work.
---
Because you have always been the enemy, you synth.
---
Because inventory mamagement is part of the game... If you dont want to worry about the junk factor, pay up.
---
So I never lost anything and obviously never submitted a ticket but  after seeing this post I checked my emails and I got the email from Bethesda saying I will get all that scrap in the next 4 days.
---
To be honest, I think part of the problem with the vanishing of fantastical roleplaying ideas is simply that there's a big difference between things like imagining singing to stranger for caps as a fun thought experiment, and then actually earnestly singing into your microphone while playing an MMO game and knowing there's a stranger on the other side whose facial expressions and body language you can't read and could very well be actively disdaining you over the anonymous sea of the internet with no way of you knowing.
---
Or that most niche, gimmicky roleplay ideas are, to be practical, only really fun for about five minutes.
---
The emails said "based on rarity". Apparently they think vault steel is only twice as hard to get as black titanium.
---
I can't hit the up button more than once. THIS WOULD BE AMAZE-BALLS.
---
So the scrap box shouldn’t exist at all, in order to maintain consistent gameplay.
---
That’s some good stuff. Clearly they’re paying more attention here than we thought. I find it strange that they’re so open about how bugged the game really is
---
\*cough\* Idk what your talking about I have never obliterated someone or peoples who preys on low lvls on my no life lvl 350 toon with my other soulless friends who also have no lifes on their higher then my lvl toons.
---
Thanks i just looked it up, the geometry is indeed different, especially the handguard and stock. Maybe we’ll just get a new skin for the handmade instead.
---
I may have to partake in that.
---
I find the heart emote conveys all those positive things!  I just spam that to say thanks!
---
Best of luck
---
Yeah no. “Hey just a daily reminder about that thing you guys bitched about for a month straight three weeks ago and is dying down a little continue the circle jerk guys xD” is pathetic karma begging. You’re cringe bro
---
Sorry that you feel the need to insult me. Unfortunately for you, I don't have time or interest in dealing with your wounded ego.
---
\*shitposting intensifies\*
---
Sucks to be sure. I'd be afraid to spend any money in the game. Glad I got it on sale, had my fun and jumped ship heh.
---
My shotgun works better and siloruns go smoother when I invite myself to some friend's server.
---
Low levels are absolutely brutal in this game. You can never be the God among men that you were in the older games, but it definitely gets better.
---
Vs the guy desperately trying to be recognized by Todd Howard?
---
No, the gameplay is consistent... Cant you play without the scrapbox?
---
Can you give me the link so i can look it up please i cant find it .. thank you in advance !
---
Welp. I now know what my mule will be doing. Thanks for the info!
---
Come to me I have I've 4k in steel
---
so you say its not an actual working, tanky power armor ? just a prototype
---
If this happened they better make him a 3* and they better let us keep him permanently :(
---
I was under every time
---
Every week it seems like they’re working hard to fix bugs on a game that released a year ago. Im pretty certain that Wastelanders will be so buggy that it may literally make the game unplayable.
---
Np man, I played hell with those damn things not blooming lol, I have 4 chars now and 3 of them collect and 1 crafts.
---
The most fun ive had was playong spooky scary skeletons on the mic and wearing a skeleton costume
---
agreed
---
Or maybe they just didn't like it because it made the game shit? That sounds pretty shitty.
---
Heart emote works for thank you and for sorry in this case. If its "sorry you hit me in cross fire and I accidentally killed you in crossfire", the heart is more of a taunt than a sorry
---
Every time it procs for whatever reason Blooms spawn for me. I hope to my camp (after Heart of the Swamp procs), fast travel to Dryer Chemical, strangler blooms for whatever reason. In the 9 or so times I've used this method only once was there no blooms.
---
Thx !
---
jetpack fix is literally coming in 2020
---
Interesting. This will motivate me to continue hoarding.
---
https://youtu.be/q0lnhSwK3ws it was hidden in there I wasn't expecting it
---
If you wanna believe that, go ahead
---
Add the service rifle and I might consider getting back on
---
It's just really odd to me people continued to play a game they considered shit and instead of playing something else just screamed and whined until the whole game changed.
---
Translation: I am entitled to everything for free and if I don’t get it all for free, I’ll cry about it on a subreddit till I do get it for free!
---
Ok Karen.
---
Definitely not as bad as people make it out to seem, but people just love negativity. Still, there are a lot of glaring issues with it, and a ton of lost potential. 
---
But it’s fun to dick around in
---
It will be "fixed" like the sentry bot looping sound.
---
I definitely use and abuse the heart emote at this point! My anxiety's just pretty silly and worries that people will think the heart emotes are foolish or whatnot, even though I'm always happy to receive a heart emote myself.
---
I think the bleak atmosphere of Fallout is still intact in the best game. However it was missing the dark humor, nothing was really funny like in Fallout's classic games.
---
 The scorched, finding everyone dead, having to actually survive with food and water? Pretty bleak like how Fallout should be. 
---
The problem is all of the updates have been almost too jokey. Like they added much needed humor but the game needs to blend the dark and the comedy. They got close with Sheepsquatch Imposter questline but it still wasn't right
---
Unless you do something clearly dickish like take someone's junk bag, the heart emote is great
---
I literally had to make a post about Tong Yea's fucking lies about all helmets being bad and contaminated, creating fear mongering. Fuck that tool.
---
But double wasn't an option on lever actions when the purveyor was released... that's a legacy gun
---
the graphics in the trailers look way nicer than in game max setting.
---
I made a post the other day because I couldn't believe a top post was praising them for rolling back the old games home screen. A lot of people were really adamant that was a really important part of that patch.
---
Imma give it a shot when it rolls around
---
Devs do tell what can be communicated.  They don't decide what *gets* communicated.  Neither do the CMs.  All that gets approved at a higher level.
---
Too little too late IMO
---
By double VATS I meant VATS50 and 25% Less VATS cost.  The prefix was Instigating.
---
Instead of lowering my bill, can my dollar just be worth more?
---
Honestly, releasing smoothly and having bugs under control at launch seems more important than actual content at this point.
---
If they can do that, start small and focused, and then expand from there Bethesda will be on the right path.
---
Only $100 a year!
---
I feel like if you still give actual money to the atom shop you pretty much deserve the scum thrown at you. Sorry but it's been years we know how Bethesda operates.
---
What you are describing is how I read their comment. You want to jump but instead of jumping it activates the Jetpack, which sends you further into the air than a normal jump.
---
Fallout 76 costed me $60 dollars. I have purchased many *cosmetic* items from the atomic shop.
---
If disliking game changing content being put behind a paywall in a still heavily broken game makes me entitled, then so be it.
---
Surely you would have to change the variable in question successfully (and not any other variable) before they could detect (probably via detailed logs) you were performing an exploit. So not doing this correctly shouldn't flag you, and the 'hundreds of times' they're talking about only relates to the successful attempts (ie. once they found the correct variable).
---
I pray to Todd this happens.
---
They simply didn't give us the proper tools to do most of those things.
---
I would have loved to be able to stay in the world and vendor items or give quests after I leave.
---
If I can do all that on a private Ultima Online server (POL based), why can't I do that here....
---
Waiting for private custom servers and or legendary characters.
---
I was gunna be a traveling merchant, but trading was too buggy and everyone shot me on sight so I gave up.
---
Well they should be open about it. Fallout 76 is their baby, and we're the ones paying for it.
---
Happy to see the news about Wastelanders, I expect this is going to be absolutely HUGE for this game, likely warranting a 2nd round of gaming outlet reviews. A renaissance as it were..
---
Its not true. They haven't even finished the Vault 96 quests
---
Drink. There is water or booze everywhere. I honestly see speed demon as a mutation with no disadvantages. You can wear armor with weight reduction for food to make it easier.
---
If there's a christmas event in December, how about we have things unlocked by Dec 24, not the week of Dec 24th to 31st?
---
As funny as I find some of those patch notes, I really am glad I can wear my PAID Atom shop glasses with my PAID Atom shop hat now.
---
But we really need to fix the 250DR and energy weapon invulnerability bugs.
---
I still play almost every day. I've run out of stuff to do besides dailies and atom challenges but i somehow still find fun. I'm really excited for wastelanders but Bethesda's track record with updates makes me think there will be at least a few unintended bugs unless they launch the pts before then. And because so much of the future is kind of riding on a good soft relaunch with wastelanders i am worried about the future of this game. I enjoy it and i want it to thrive but i feel if they mess up such a big release there wont be any coming back for much of the fan base. The issue that bothers me the most atm is the hacking in nw. Besides atoms and dailies thats the only thing i can do. But hackers ruin the fun of it. And its sad because its actually a really fun mode contrary to most people incl me saying they didn't want battle royale.
---
Nah, devs don't get involved with communication at all. Product owners and business analysts partner up with team management.

There's no pleasing some people, huh?
---
I see.  Vats50 you mean, yeah I actually have an identical instigating lever and it's great so I'm sorry for your loss
---
Not a bug. OP must be mistaken. Had Motion Assist on ExPA over over 100 lvls, recently swapped it out for Tesla and I lost the appropriate carry weight. 
---
There may of been a bug for those in PA sub Str 10 where Motion Assist would add 2, but still being less than 11 just reset you to 11 rather than 13, but that is purely a guess.
---
Tbh in a way it kind of was
---
Some people around here desperately try to praise the game, even when evidence shows us that it's pretty mediocre.
---
I was going to be a bar tender and inn keeper but business was slow that and the stash limit meant I would have to have given up a lot of space that would have been used for weapons and junk
---
This guy gets it.

Every ghoul in the Whitespring is dressed up like Drunk Uncle, and they start sobbing when you attack.
---
I've been playing Fallout games since 1998, so I'm never disappointed, I've just learned to manage my expectations, it's easy really, you already know what to expect, you just have to accept that Bethesda..... Bethesda never Changes.
---
I’m 50/50 on Heart causing blooms to spawn, and until recently, like you thought I could only get during the event. 
---
Then while arguing that fact with someone, blooms appeared with no event and no one at Dyer doing the quest.
---
I meant it had 2nd and 3rd star modifiers that helped with vats.  Many call them “double VATS” weapons. So that’s why I called it an Instigating Double VATS Lever.
---
I like the idea, but I think being able to flag them in your PipBoy would be easier (like favorite-ing).
---
Great PSA, thanks!

It often activates without a high jump. It’s like a sad jump. The high jump seems to only happen in high stress activities, mostly scorched earth.
---
Yea. I lost over 5,000 Pds in junk including over 3,000 nuclear material &amp; 5,000 screws. 
---
Very glad to see them do the right thing in addressing this, as the way it was ultimately handled determined whether I would continue to play &amp; ultimately pay for a fallout 1st sub.
---
I'm excited for Wastelanders and hope it really does add the much needed depth and balancing to the game and keeps the game going for a long time, but I also think Wastelanders will never be enough for the lynch mobs and that expectations are running way too high. Realistically, the best we can hope for is that it addresses the major bugs and balances a variety of playstyles, adds a good deal of new content and that it's not too scummy on the microtransactions and subscriptions. If it's not a buggy mess like some of their other updates have been, it has a chance to bring back some of the players who have left and if there's enough depth to the story, it might bring back some of the Fallout players who wanted a more traditional Fallout experience with co-op gameplay. 
---
We have to be honest though, it will never reach the levels that it should have if it had been a fully developed multiplayer Fallout game from the start instead of an experiment in pushing the engine to the limits that was rushed out the door to fill a hole in a release schedule that was at least six months before the game was actually consistently playable. But if Wastelanders is good enough, we may see an ESO type of revival where it becomes a staple of Bethesda's ongoing plan.
---
Really immersive with all of their preexisting nonconsensual groping.
---
You're aware it used to be lower right.
---
Maybe an increase to 50k. It would be better if it wouldnt let them purchase something if the total made you go over your limit.
---
Oh here we go “ This game is totally broken!”
---
Blah blah blah.
---
I wonder if there was indeed a correlation between us with very large amounts of junk stored and the scrapbox junk deletion bug.  I guess we’ll never really know.
---
I'm way too introverted to do that haha.
---
Although when they did the Free To Play weekend, I did don a bathrobe and the Old Man Winter mask, and just followed around noobs shaking my head disapprovingly at everything they did.  That was fun.
---
Doesn’t matter since they’re useless if they’re stacked. You can only activate the quest but picking up a fresh one.
---
No. At least In my case, it happened when you force quit the game when loading into a world - I had meant to join a private &amp; joined a adventure world.
---
Raising it wont solve the problem unfortunately. It'll just allow for higher prices and again we are dealing with the cap, although it will be much higher. This would make caps less valuable.   
---
For high value trades your best off using an outside marketplace and selling / trading 1 to 1.
---
Bethesda never changes indeed
---
*laughs in scrapbox*
---
I'm going to save my excitement for when the bugs are actually fixed.
---
some keys don't properly stack. It makes the miscellaneous tab feel cluttered to navigate if I want to manage other misc. things like ore or technical data. Plus, when I join a server, it wouldn't have to load or keep track of all the extra keys in my inventory.
---
Wastelanders will make or break this game. If it fails, we can say goodbye to Fallout 76. If it succeeds, we can either expect more things like Fallout 1st, or Bethesda will finally realize that it's better to drop meaningful updates.
---
Thanks for the comment and sorry for the delayed response...  
---
When you say Sensitivity do you mean the movement and reaction, it's response to the fire comment or?
---
If they ever did this, they’d pretty much have to make it something you pay to submit to prevent all the internet trolls. 
---
It is an awesome idea, though.
---
50k would be a perfect number, but alternatively there could be a buffer like 30k holding after max caps. This means you could be at 30k, and someone goes to your vendors and purchases up to 30k more which would be held for you and trickle into main amount of cap space. This would help you have time to shut down your vendors.
---
standard or expert, standard being relatively easy
---
the steel is the problem, that is 2 months worth of steel being given away, it takes 14 days straight of every mission for 1 power armor.  the steel is also the major grind, because the plans are easy and quick to get.  you will have all the plans well before you get the steel
---
K.
---
Mine happened after my game crashed due to some guy bombarding my camp with mini nukes until the game froze completely.  (Possibly Fallout 1st griefing, as it was the 2nd day it had been out). I’m just wondering if it would have not deleted my junk if I only had say 800 items in the scrapbox instead of 100K+ items, in that game crashing situation.
---
never noticed the location change turning it off, that is weird.  
---
Start recently or B.E.T.A. age?  
---
  
---
Thanks, let me know!
---
Imho I don’t think it would have mattered
---
We will be pleased when they stop talking about fixing things and actually fix them instead.
---
I've had a few such sessions on XB1, and really enjoy them, unfortunately it's the rare exception.
---
Some of the others can be fun as well, a couple of friends and I found a group of 3 baiting people with a low (24) level Wanted character the other day, and watched as they killed several would be bounty hunters, then we moved into position, murdered them, and leveled their Camp, they were even brazen enough to seek revenge once before logging off &amp; blocking us, we got a good laugh out of it.
---
Thanks for the info, had no idea.
---
oh I stand corrected.  I was unaware you could get the plans on the lower tier difficulty
---
I think it's interesting that people claim it'll be "too little" when having no idea what the scope of Wastelanders will actually be.
---
To be fair, a lot of that's on Bethesda's end for being so secretive with it, and I'm not surprised people are doubtful, but I think they want to try to impress players and not show all their cards too early so there's room for surprise. Some people will think it's naive, but I'm willing to wait and see what comes of everything without discounting the efforts of devs that are likely trying their best-- if there's anything good about 76, it's the world design and the small stories scattered about, and I'm hoping that most of the people who had their hands in those aspects will be working on Wastelanders as well.
---
&gt; Why is the limit so low anyway? 
---
Counterpoint: Why are your prices so high? 😋
---
If you don't take into account the worst case scenario, then it just might come back to bite you.  You are totally within your right to log off the moment you saw yourself going over the cap.
---
Using discord is a PITA when you are talking about people you don't normally play with. In game team chat is far easier to coordinate and not affect everyone else in the area.
---
We have already established that all of the things that need balancing need balancing regardless of the addition of the ability to add more slots to a team.
---
I am going to go out on a limb and say you probably feel the way you do because you have not faced the challenges that some of us have when trying to coordinate these things.
---
At least they tell us specifically what they're aiming to fix my guy
---
Haha- that is the most introverted role play I’ve heard ;). I’m thinking I might dust off my old Wasteland Santa cosplay again this year- giving gifts to low level players
---
Yeah it's stupid. I tried dropping them too.
---
Purveyor sale (facepalm). I just used up over 600 scrip that I had been building up last night. Sigh.
---
Better get back on that grind
---
&gt;  it will never reach the levels that it should have if it had been a fully developed multiplayer Fallout game from the start 
---
I was just about to type something similar.
---
I think we're probably past the point of "Revival" for this game.  I would be surprised if the active player base ever grows past what it was at launch.  I'm hoping that it keeps the game alive enough that they keep putting resources into fixing and updating it, but I'm not expecting them to suddenly have a hit on their hands with this game no matter what happens.  
---
I say that as someone who enjoys the game.  The word of mouth is horrible on this game.  Even my friends who don't play video games AT ALL have heard that it's a buggy mess.
---
Thanks My Lord, I will defiantly try that out, blessings and amen 🙏
---
So, the community wants 'Thank You' and 'Sorry' emotes? We'll put 'em in the atomic shop next patch and push back new content a few more months
---
\- Probably some Bethesda Guy
---
Yea, you would think with the dozens of posts reporting the same issues it would get their attention at some point.
---
I've never seen a minecraft trailer
---
I hide my high price vendor when I get close to limit.
---
Mediocre is an understatement here.
---
I still haven't finished the quest that allows you to enter the silos... currently looking for the radio transmitters or something like that from the Brotherhood. :(
---
it's a Bethesda induced issue.
---
About 4 or so months ago after one of the patches the game started running on the wrong GPU..
---
Instead of my main GPU (GPU 0, 2080 Ti) it started running on my second GPU (GPU 1, not a 2080 Ti) and as a result it's effectively rendering the game a couple times, taking my performance from 120 FPS+ when I have one client open down to as low as 5 FPS on one of my characters.
---
No hardware or software change on my side when this started, I know because my system is locked down from updating ANYTHING by group policy, and I have to credential for every software install.
---
Since then I've updated and rolled back drivers on GPU, motherboard, etc, and of 18+ games I own, INCLUDING FO4, only '76 does this.  
---
The Dev's refuse to really acknowledge or troubleshoot the issue (They keep sending me troubleshoot steps outlined in the very specific details I've provided, so looks like are not really listening)
---
I like the m79 though, it's only abusive if they're using the reload perk. Otherwise there's time to kill before you get another one in your face. Maybe fully remove explosive heavy weapons away from heavy weapon perks, don't think it needs to go in a terminal
---
..is the number of the community guideline this post violated...
---
Pretty sure the only thing that would change would be "so I was near the *new max* and somebody bought a buncha stuff &amp; I lost X amount of caps"
---
I have 4 characters and usually over 100,000 caps.  I think a 1000,000 cap limit makes more sense to me because....who doesn't want to have a million caps?  That's basically why I'm playing right now.  I just want all the caps.  It would be even better if there was a daily log on bonus of 5% interest on my caps.
---
Had this not been reported before?
---
My biggest holdback to reporting all the bugs I see is that I assume you'll already be aware.
---
How can we get a list of known bugs officially from you guys?
---
there better be a damn red nosed radstag
---
I had consolidated the junk from 13 characters to a single scrapbox when I lost my junk.  Many of the items I am getting in compensation will be lower than what I had before I lost my stuff. So to me, the compensation seems reasonable.  The only thing I didn’t have a lot of was vault steel.  
---
So to me, this isn’t a mistake.  They are trying to make it right for players like me who lost a lot.  I’m sure plenty of players will be overcompensated, but I really don’t think it’s going to hurt their enjoyment of the game.
---
250DR hasnt...
---
It's not like anybody can deny that. :)
---
But yeah, I like that they're opening up a bit more.
---
The part I don't really get is the whole "We were planning to fix this in Wastelanders, but we'll look into making it sooner."
---
Maybe Wastelanders is a lot more sweeping than we realize, but it's hard to imagine why something like the +250 DR perk not working would have been dependent on the rest of Wastelanders.  Also, Bethesda gets very little right the first time.  Why shove so many fixes into a single, monolithic patch like that, which is probably going to introduce a lot of new problems as well?  Is it not better to proceed at a steady pace?
---
What a waste of an update
---
I enjoyed the game myself upon initial release but there isnt much to do after establishing a nice house and getting shit you need because theres no one around that has a voice other then players and well... They arent the best to talk to in my experience, like give me one of the 4 companions from FO4 boom 500 hours of game play
---
Nah, that'll be Atomic Shop. I want a candy cane deathclaw gauntlet skin
---
Ha, I love pvp (it's basically my endgame) and dying doesn't bother me.
---
I can haz fix for shotguns????
---
Yes to everything
---
Fair point
---
The new display case they just added was 300 atoms, not $3. which is like a day of banging out atom challenges. I should know because that's what I did for mine lol
---
You should list all the sources you've counted so we can add others we think of
---
Ah, pity you're on PS4, I'd do some fight over workshop with ya ;)
---
I see you around a *lot* here. I'm being genuine here-- you clearly think the game's a waste of time in its current state, so why give 76 more of the extremely limited resource of your lifetime by spending such a quantity here, still talking about the game? Wouldn't your time be better spent doing something you actually enjoy?
---
Yeah, but what about guys like me who had more junk than we are being compensated with?  Should it be “dialed back” even though I had more?  I think Bethesda is trying to do the right thing, and they probably have a better idea of the amount of items were lost by the average player who had the bug.
---
Honestly? No, I wasnt. This is the second time in maybe 2 months I've maxed out. How much lower was it? Holy crap!
---
Ain’t related to this, but enjoy your reddit premium whilst you’ve got it.
---
So mad at myself for heeding the warning and not moving junk. Had mine only been deleted,  I would have junk for months and build me some vault armor.
---
Too much talking. I prefered the last week’s one
---
If theh dump it all with Wastelanders, given their record, they will make the update totally unplayable.
---
Yes but can we get the things the game currently has working correctly all the time before we go adding more broken things?
---
It doesn't have a subscription fee. It has a subscription option.
---
You people are the biggest cry babies of any game community.
---
I have had this happen a few times. I would change your password just to be safe.
---
This is my thought. If it's literally going immediately off, I don't think it *can* be a software issue.
---
Lol yeah, it used to be 25k, the limit is there for a few reasons, many disagree with them. You can start other characters to hold caps, I have 4 mules but the mules turn into other characters over lvl 100 lol
---
It would certainly be easier, but how could they monetize such a feature? Let's be realistic here boys! /s
---
&gt;I think Bethesda figured that we would be way more into roleplaying than we are. 
---
They thought people would be so into roleplaying that they didn't need to bother to implement roleplaying mechanics allowing you to do so.
---
They are just giving those who lost items 4 free junk items that can be scrapped.  This is clearly much easier to implement in scale compared to replacing a single player’s lost Handmade, or whatever.  Since many people had the same issue, they can have developers address it.
---
There was a kill a legendary at a fissure site im preety sure theres no guaranteed chance at legendary enemies and as i said before im mainly refering to the normal ones not the dailys
---
"We are aware of this issue"
---
I'm referring to aiming sensitivity or how quickly the character looks around. 
---
Typically zooming in has reduced speeds/sensitivity as does FO76 in 1st person view, in 3rd person view it does not. I'm on xbox and there isn't any options to adjust this, PC may be different.
---
I didn't know that. I've been too lazy to deal with conduits so far and just started building style into my camps instead of purely for function. That's good to know going forward.
---
I have a bar as my camp, and it has a bartender. Only problem is people dont visit because I only have booze and food for sale lol. Maybe I'll make another vendor for other stuff just to get more people to come
---
I enjoy 76, and Fallout in general. I don't enjoy Bethesda being twats.
---
Well in my case you are wrong.  I consolidated the junk of 13 different characters and then lost it all.
---
"Level up while level 1 in Flatwoods"
---
"Level up while level 4 in Morgantown"
---
"Level up while level 13 wearing a thong"
---
But I'm level 100+.
---
"Do X while in a team or party"
---
I play solo.
---
Vault "raid" and Project Paradise challenges. How am I supposed to do them if I can't even get 1 or 2 other players to join the event?
---
They're putting off as much work as they can for one big update, like they said they're looking at bloodied and Unyielding legendary effects but that was like four months ago, thinking that there will be a HUGE rebalance of the game
---
So I think that in order for Wastelanders to be awesome BGS needs to :
---
1: Start surprising us with random settler/raider/human npc encounters now.  People will log back in for this. Do this before Christmas.
---
2: Run Wastelanders on a separate server from the Scorched World.  That is, if the story really is that we've vanquished the Scorched and made the Wasteland safe enough for settlers to consider re populating.  A player would have to finish the first world overseers quest and defeat the Queen to advance to Wastelanders
---
3: Allow us to actually clean the Wasteland.  There's a lot of random junk everywhere.
---
Wrong door my mate
---
the blunderbuss could use this! I want the blunderbuss to use this!
---
Sorry, Vault 94
---
Whats wrong with them? I havnt used any shotgun in ages...
---
careful, if you say anything logical in here you get downvoted lol
---
Thats for the mayor for a day quest and that still exist to my knowledge
---
50k would be good, but honestly, even that's too low if you ask me. Even the old-school 8 bit games gave you a cap of 356k... I understand the logistics of keeping track of all players and server stability, but 30k? Before vending machines, that would have been fine. Hell, 15k would have been alright, but now? Needs to be much, much higher in my own opinion. Just a thought though.
---
In the mean time NW will drop with lvl 50 enemies that my explosive lazer rifle will have no problem destroying a whole room of raiders... and I will be lvl 643... this is an issue no one is talking about... Wastelanders will be super super easy... they should do some lvl scalling on the DLC... so that new weapons are worth picking up...
---
Only the small minority of 1st members who lost their junk get this compensation.  So it definitely doesn’t make 1st p2w. It was actually pay to lose (your junk) and now they are being compensated for this loss one month later.
---
If you want a list of 'currently working on' items, you get it from the devs, at least if you're internal (part of the company).  That's all I was saying.
---
Asking anyone else is...problematic, and likely as not spun in a way that wouldn't go over well (or incomplete).  Though you're right, it's rarely the devs putting the list together for publication.  So embrace the spin!
---
Source: nearing 30 years worked in bureaucracies :P
---
Too many bugs and too little time!  
---
I've got this on one of my bug roundup pages, but had not added it to the Wiki's.

Added to the following and cited your comment, thanks for taking the time!

---
it still doesn't explain why i was told twice they cant modify a players inventory, so now the system is in place it can be addressed on a much smaller scale. Both the 1st scrap box error and not getting something when you fulfilled the requirements are server/non player`s fault so it is super suspicious they have developers fix the problem for the 1st players and not the general playerbase
---
:)
---
These are still great bugs to focus on.
---
Well if you increase it too much it effects (affects?) the in game economy. Prices would skyrocket. A better solution would be to add something in that you could sink caps into.
---
Fallout 76 did a terrible job at being Rust, it does a ok job at other things. I don't see why people shouldn't want Bethesda to focus on things they are at least semi competent at. I Don't want to dive to deep in as it seems like Zenimax criticism triggers you.
---
Thanks for the comment!  
---
Not seen that before, Question(s):  
---
\-100% sure you had "Green Thumb" on (I'm bad about that, especially after scrapping in my  C.A.M.P.) ?    
---
\-Seen it on anything besides FireCracker Berries?
---
Fair. Based on the posts I've seen, I'm honestly surprised that you do enjoy 76? I try to dwell more on the things I find entertaining during my free time, but I hardly blame people for being frustrated when it comes to many elements of this game.
---
No, you'd get it from TPOs since they're the ones who actually create user stories, plan and groom sprints, et cetera.
---
The point of a TPO is to specifically prevent devs from having to waste time on shit like this.
---
Lie detector test determined: That was a lie.
---
Not to sound insensitive to your plight, but that image is funny as hell.
---
Well I think the true answer is they could absolutely modify any characters inventory if they would allocate the resources to do it.  They obviously just can’t justify doing it for a single player issue.  BUT, if there’s a widespread issues happening to hundreds or thousands of players, it makes sense to allocate resources to try to address it.  
---
I’m not saying it’s fair to the single player who lost something, but it makes sense business-wise.
---
Very much yeah. The trailers reflect the 15 seconds of action. There’s a lot of needing to eat and drink in between. And waiting. Lots of waiting. And wandering. And dressing up as turkeys.
---
Omfg this happened to be not that long ago. I was at like 25k and someone was at my camp and literally bought every single junk, ammo, clothes and stimpacks I had. I lost out on about 3k
---
I have to agree, there is a legit reason for not letting people have two machines.
---
agree 100%
---
Confirmed. I was the Filthy Commie that corrected y'all about the X-02 plans.
---
Here's the thing. They need content that is long lasting and has a payoff for the grind. I have created tons of posts with ideas they need/should implement that allows us to create our own fun.  There are dozens of great ideas that are posted daily and I hope they seriously consider implementing them. 
---
-camp construction
---
-factions
---
-ever upwards
---
-new nuke zones
---
-vault exploratio
---
-legendary garming
---
-player vending
---
I know what they're doing.
---
I just question the wisdom of that choice.
---
Yes. It seems if I get like... 100 glowing mass and hardened mass, I’ll get 30-40 HR fluids.
---
Thanks and no worries, will try and track down those 2 outfits!
---
OMG this.  They make incredibly fun games, but QC has always been their Achilles heel.  They’re kinda like that one friend that can pick up any instrument and start playing Freebird in ten minutes, but cannot ever show up to work on time.
---
I didn’t buy Fallout 1 or 2 anywhere close to launch, so I have no idea what state they shipped in. I got lots of crashes anyways.
---
lol so dramatic
---
Sounds rational but this is Bethesda we're talking about
---
This is why we don't have nice things.  Get rekt dude.
---
It's not only players, it happens with NPCs. These are one of the bugs who mostly stand out (the ones most upvoted on the patch notes). They won't acknowledge u/Aten_Ra for some reason.
---
Any chance for the range and accuracy perks to be fixed or addressed on the next patch? It seems small but it provides a huge advantage in NW and I’d be extremely excited to see the same in adventure mode
---
You monster! Some of us don't have a way to go to links. Joking aside I will wait till I get home then as current computer blocks everything thats gaming related such as Pokemon reddit but oddly doesn't classify Fallout 76 reddit as gaming.
---
I'm sure it's more peacocking as again we have nothing in our hands. Tell me lies.....
---
You must be new if you haven't seen the plethora of people running bloodied with meat hooks, deathclaw or mole miner gauntlets.
---
at most people lost ~150-200 steel assuming they never spent it and ran since vault launch, they are giving everyone 600 including those that have never ran the raid
---
I would say its not for every one, and dont expect many RPG features. But the community is nice so just ask for help when/if you do!
---
They’ve done sales a few times so far, so naturally they’d do it again.  I’ve been keeping characters around 900 since the big Clean Appalachia sale in anticipation for the next one.  I just spend 150 a day, top it back off, and stay close to the limit.
---
it will never be enough
---
Oh Lord :-D You know all the darkest corners of the web for sure
---
my sole problem is also the vault steel. i can see the flux since its easy to grind for the people who drop nukes 24/7
---
Polar Yao Guai!

I just want a flip the bird emote.

[Fallout 76 Bug Roundup | UnderArmor](https://www.reddit.com/r/76BugWiki/comments/dfhncw/fallout_76_bug_roundup_underarmor/)
---
Yeah, I was figuring there would be one around Christmas, not this soon.
---
Upvoting for visibility. Happens to mobs too. Very annoying bug.
---
Community in game (and on here for the most part) is awesome. I would recommend just playing the game and enjoying the experience rather than trying to min/max or 100% everything. See where it takes you.
---
Melee would be good...the swords, hatchets, axes and sledges gives you a lot to play with. For guns the Black powder of course.  For armor-leather Armor or the basic Metal. Id make it a food build too. Keep drugs to a min since those require tech.  I had a friend who made a toon that only used tech that was available during the 1850s. Even his CAMP was old fashioned. It was fun to run with him on that toon.
---
Heres my idea: 
---
1. The devs need to go through and make silver and ore deposits only available at workshops. This increases the rarity and makes the ore deposits something players want. This promotes organic pvp.
---
2. Make workshops only able to be challenged every half hour.  
---
3.Ocrese the value of silver to 5 caps and gold to 10 caps per piece.
---
Still waiting to hear more about Wastelanders before I get active again. The combo of the update getting delayed and First releasing killed a lot of buzz I had going for the game so, while bug fixes are fantastic, I'm still not convinced the game's turning into something I want to keep playing.
---
Sounds epic. Needs to get done.
---
There isnt
---
Too many people do it they just stop refunding like they did with the game at launch.
---
I wouldn’t say it’s the “nail in the coffin” as I don’t see there being an overall negative impact at all.  But, with Death Stranding, Civ 6, Fallen Order, and then Cyberpunk 2077 right around the corner I feel like there is too much content on offer which is new to allow a “revival” of sorts.  I think in order to bide their time before Cyberpunk, most people would prefer to engage in one of the games that has come out this fall which they didn’t have time to play instead of revisiting Fallout.  I love Fallout and really enjoyed playing Fallout 76 for a long time.  I never really had any major bugs/issues.  A few things, maybe, but I never encountered anything I couldn’t work around except maybe like one quest that was inconsequential at the time.  So I am coming from the perspective of really having enjoyed the game.  That’s just what I see.
---
I mean, how many people killed Trashcan Karla lol
---
So what's the over/under on them completely breaking spin-up guns beyond usability with this patch?
---
It’s not like normal fallout in that ur limited to the number of perks u can have equipped at any time. That being said I would also recommend picking a “build” like focusing ur development on one class of weaponry. Being that ur perks r limited it’s unwise to focus on melee and big guns..
---
Another good question u might ask the community is what r the common builds. I have two characters - a big guns power armor guy and a stealth rifle guy who also uses vats
---
Agreed. We need a lot more useful emotes in general.
---
Really?   
---
This is pretty interesting, let me know if it returns.....    
---
What I find even more odd is you're not the only one to have seen it.
---
I hear you, and as much as I think this is a simple QoL change, you're probably right.
---
Thank god I was tired of that bush always duping and head shooting me while shooting into the sky.
---
The limit on caps is a monetary and inflationary control regime common to real-world currency systems. Owing to this game’s lack of a central monetary agency (like the Federal Reserve) to enact policies that could help moderate inflation/deflation scenarios —and the fact that an unregulated online virtual economy often provides near-limitless income— Bethesda gave us a hard-limit to the size of our wallets. That limit may seem arbitrary, but it is not counter-productive to our interests. It serves its purpose to prevent runaway inflation and the devaluation of our accepted currency. 
---
Other systems are in place to further reduce the potential for hyperinflation. For example, vendorbots are a clear example of price control— and player-owned vending machines often base their prices relative to what the vendorbots offer. Additionally, we are subjected to excise, property, and sales taxes whenever we fast-travel, relocate a camp, or vend loot. These “taxes” serve to remove excess accumulated wealth from the system, which also helps to reduce inflationary effects.
---
It’s maybe not the best system, but it seems to be fairly well implemented.
---
It actually did happen. It happened well for first 8 months then we got bored because things weren't fixed and it became ptw
---
I mean I've seen it but that doesn't feel super medieval to me tbh. And missile launchers was just an example.
---
Sweet little lies...
---
To my understanding they were nerfed pretty hard back when TSE shotguns were all the rage and they've never recovered even though Two Shot and Explosive also got nerfed. Shotguns as a weapon class are less viable than most other weapons.
---
Sorry your first raid went badly. Meltdown can be tough especially if you don't know the possible spawn points for ID cards. For freezing issues, we've found that it's better to restart the game and rejoin the team if we've been playing for over an hour (do it outside of the Vault before going in - or if you find yourself taking a long time between tries, restart after a couple failed run). There's probably some sort of memory/resource leak that gets worse and worse the longer you spend in the Raid.
---
not "normally" harmful...  
---
Early on a few of us got killed and then crashed out of the Server, so no chance to recover our loot, but thankfully servers are "generally" more stable
---
I wonder what they mean about “chowing down on a massive feast together”, as mentioned with the purveyor sale?  Is Grahm cooking this year?
---
Youd want leather armors for sure, metal maybe if you could overlook its rough appearance. I'm not sure about outfits I'd check Duffy and see if anything fits the look theres the radstag hide but it's in rough shape
---
You have a good idea on the weapons and theres even a tomahawk recipe for your throwing axes! :)
---
This would be an amazing idea if we ever get guilds or a buildable guild camp
---
I'm very excited that there's companions coming in Wastelanders! I just hope they're closer to Fallout 4's iterations than 3's.
---
Major update in 2020 releases bug fix for jetpacks, new bug discovered that all armor rating of power armors turn to 0 and breaks on contact.
---
“We are working around the clock to address [Insert Customer Service Issue here] and will have it fixed as soon as possible.
---
Thank you for your continued patience.”
---
We have a [Known Issues list](https://bethesda.net/community/post/1860792) but it is not comprehensive of every single bug in the system, mostly bugs we see brought up a lot on the forums, here, social media, etc. We're planning on updating this today with the latest from today's Inside The Vault on the Jetpack bug, 250 DR, etc. 
---
As for reporting bugs, you are always more than welcome to report them through [our help site](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10). "In Game Support" is the category you want there. It's always better to report *just* in case. Worst case scenario, they are aware but we'd rather have the report than not have it if that makes sense?
---
Yes very sure I had green thumb on, I checked straight away. It's the only time I've noticed it, so only firecracker berries.
---
Here's a possible theory though. I had a bunch of old firecracker berries that were about to expire, and they "grabbed" some of the freshly picked ones on their way out to becoming spoiled fruit? I think I've seen fresh ingredients get "collected" like that in other circumstances too, where their condition gets synced up with older ones.
---
That sounds great haha def will be using some of those ideas. I didn't even think about the drugs..
---
Gosh, that makes me also want the Chinese pistol back from Fallout 3.  Maybe even a quest to get a Legendary Variant based on the Zhu-Rong unique that set enemies on fire!
---
I don't think it was even a bug with green thumb, as like I said, I didnt even have half of what I expected to have.
---
KRAMPUS is a Deathclaw.
---
Take it slow. The survival aspect is very real in the lower levels. Gathering materials and aid is important, there are days when I logged on simply to get resources so I could continue with the story line.  
---
Also the story line can out pace you if you are only playing the story. You will need to spend some time developing your character in between quests to keep from getting crushed.
---
Try to determine a weapon time you want to pursue and formulate a build for damage perks early. Other perks can be completely based on your play style but you dont want to get into a position late game where you are really week, consuming extra ammo and killing things slowly. Respecing isn't really a thing in this game right now and if you choose to respec or fix a character it may require dozens of levels.  
---
Vendors have a 1400 Cap daily limit. When you don't feel you need steel from scrapping weapons I suggest selling them to vendors to get some caps.
---
It's definitely really old, noticed first in January (I wasn't in the BETA, bought the game on release day.)
---
Its something to do with the Enforcer perk, I run a bloodied build with a Bloodied combat shotgun and the health bar of any enemy I shoot with it rubber bands all over the place.  I'll bring the health bar down to almost nothing with the first shot and watch the bar go to 10% and immediately shoot back up to around 60.  So I have to spam a whole clip to kill something
---
True!! But you know that hoodie costs less than 50$ to produce. but like i said, exclusivity is a thing in it self. thats why some people pay up to 3k for a pair of pants or 800 for a tshirt. lol
---
Rudolph the Red Nosed Rad Stag.
---
And actually ask, don't just send a random friend request and party invite spam. Things are better with a mic anyway. At least send a message
---
Yeah you'll rarely see people running those unless it's explosive laser guns, regular non-legacy energy weapons are really underwhelming. 
---
2h melee is incredibly strong, especially if it's sneak and bloodied.
---
Enforcer perk is still busted, gotta love rubber band health bars...
---

---
Gotcha!  
---
This is actually a legacy Fallout 4 issue there are mods to tweak, I'd think this would fall under "Weapons - Ranged" for where to put it, but QoL or Bug?
---
Not exactly related to the paint thing, but sometimes I have dozens to hundreds of legendaries to transfer between characters.  It would take way too long to go through the glitchy self-closing trade menu, so I either put them in a bag or suitcase and pick them up with the other character.
---
You’d check whatever project management software the company uses. Most software dev teams use agile practices, doing work 2 week sprints.
---
..not even a little pvp?
---
I've lost my best legendary weapon to this.. Didn't played the game 2 Months after it happened because I was so frustrated
---
Using healing salve instead of stims too. Basically it was entirely scavenge and forging for food/junk in a new way. Ive thought about making a farmer that was on the frontier and used analog style stuff too. Wood houses and for a genorator he used the windmill so he could get purified water. Or use Radaway.
---
So couldn't you just stop picking them up or check before to solve the problem
---
Small minority of 1st? Does that include the people that are getting emails without submitting a ticket? Considering the vault raids are the only end game content and they're getting 600 vault steel, its definitely tipping the scales heavily towards p2w, intentionally or not. I could care leas about the other mats but this is ridiculous, I could see someone holding maybe 150ish Vsteel saving for power armor, maybe even a max of 200 or so, but giving everyone 600 regardless of whether or not they ran the raid once is stupid.
---
**Sad jump** is really the best description of the phenomenon.
---
I just did that and bring it here to ask just in case.
---
Added to QoL for now.  
---
Thank you very much 👍🏼
---
Not yet, maybe as it grows
---
Some of the comments by 1st members begs to differ with you.
---
In FO76, not to the frequency that I have in other games - I was a guild leader in Everquest, Everquest 2, and World of Warcraft.  I understand that there are times where the group was full but there were other people who wanted to join, they couldn't because there was a set group limit.  And even with the best of tools it can be difficult to get even your whole guild to get organized when everyone is there.  
---
The difference is the scope of the game.  While there could be value in doing some additional balancing tweaks, it would not take the effort to re-tweak for a 4 party group, and tweak it in such a way that solo or duos could still do the content. 
---
The fact of the matter is, and I say this from experience in other games (especially Everquest) is that people are going to want a challenge appropriate to the group size.  If you exapdn the group size to larger, people will want content designed for those larger groups.  Balancing for that size groups is going to create a design issue for the devs if they want to continue to make that content available for smaller groups. 
---
The other issue is the "some of you" that you refence.  In the grand scheme of things, what % of players need access to larger groups, and what % of their playtime would even be affected by it.  Neither of us has the metrics, but anecdotally, I rarely see groups - even at events, with the exception of SBQ and Imposter Sheepsquatch, and even then there are more than a handful of solos or duos. 
---
The point is - while I can have symapthy for your frustration, there are other solutions that can be implemented in the game that do not require them to change the scope of the game from being designed primarily around 4 person parties to larger for the handful of activities (both in game and player created), especially not when there are bigger issues and an overall lack of content for groups of any size.  What you are looking for is a "nice to have' and should be put to the side until all other priority changes have been made, and even then, the best solution may not be "more slots"
---
They had something good where people could actually be raiders to start a fight by blowing a base up and getting a bounty so that you could actually give players an incentive to come after you, if you couldn't fight offer items or caps to have a bounty placed on a greifer. This games a farming simulator at this point
---
We just need more cap sinks....if you and everyone else that posts this is constantly riding a few thousand short of cap max then it's not a problem of the max being to low as it is what do we do with all these caps? 30k might as well be 300k eventually with nothing to spend caps on we will be back at max limit in a matter of time
---
Thanks for the Tag and it is a frustrating issue!  
---
They actually fixed this for 2 patches and then it returned, creeping back in slowly until it effected all weapons..  
---
No Acknowledgement yet :(
---
Oh I totally agree 
---
Melee/unarmed is my preferred playstyle in most fallouts but my main was a sniper in this one.
---
Obviously people who didn’t lose junk shouldn’t be getting this.  I’d like to think Bethesda will get this right before they give compensation to people who didn’t lose anything, but I’m not confident they will.  
---
Do we have any idea of what percentage of 1st subscribers actually lost their junk?
---
I think that this is it:  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
And they fucked up survival, sounds like a bunch of dipshits that are pve players went into survival for the 20% exp, got their asses clapped then complained till that shit was nerfed into the ground
---
We all know that's not gonna happen.
---
You can have multiple suits of armor, its only 10lbs per suit, what issue are you having? I wear one and store my other 2
---
Great thought and completely possible, or it did a condition check on the berries in your inventory as it added the new ones and they spoiled?  
---
Mind letting me know if you see it happen again?  
---
If not we could assume it was a condition check issue
---
I havent played in a month, but noticed sometimes the suits unequipped the armor when stored and then subsequently viewed through a vendor. I did all my selling with my suits in my inventory and then depot's my suits. It worked for me then. Good luck now tho.
---
am I a bad person? I never craft flux because I can easily sell the materials for profit, thanks to people who can't math or are really badly bottlenecked by one of the three mats.  My HRF goes pretty quick even if I put it on sale for 150c,  and so does glowing&amp;hardened mass for ~75c.
---
Of course you pay for the work of the designers, but that’s it. They can ask however much they want. So if they are too greedy then they’ll get called out.
---
I think this would've been more doable if permanent builds were a thing versus this whole jack of all trades, builder of all things, knower of all plans approach they did.
---
Why are you defending this scamming of people? It’s like you want to be scammed. Can you stop fucking it up for the rest of us with your terrible attitude?
---
... or request the account e warn/ ban the obvious trolls.
---
it is also immensely sketchy that the players in this instant are paying a subscription and they lost something and getting items back but there are bugs/glitches where other players have lost things and have not been refunded the things they have lost although that is on a much smaller scale. I wait and see if there is something on a similar scale happens on 
---
 the public server because with this they have made a precedent that items will be refunded
---
I've had this happen so many times...most recently when they changed the scrap box in the last update. I'm used to spamming the "store" button (A on XBox) quickly to dump my scrap into the box &amp; didn't notice until it was too late that the left list now displayed all the scrap &amp; scrapable  items you were carrying &amp; it would turn junk into scrap if it wasn't already in its "base" form. I like to look for rare in game junk items &amp; I lost some things I had spent a lot of time looking for.
---
Clearly not enough of us have purchased the Issue Awareness Kit from the Atom shop.
---
Well thats great. Creates the impression the game gets fixed with wastelanders. So after postponing the expectations with wastelanders, they postpone the expection to fix the game. At least the bought a bit more time with this and answered to The Subreddit. Good communication is something else. This is still marketing garbage and they haven't said a single word about Fallout Worst.
---
Yeah I’m sure the fact that 1st players being a source of monthly income is part of the reason they addressed it.
---
No just like when the old Dare program came to school with a pimped out corvette all custom and "dared"out it's a real working corvette just with some lights, chrome, and paint thrown on it
---
Every Fallout Game has been buggy at launch, and none have ever been completely fixed, but then again, I can't remember ever playing a video game that was  perfect.
---
C'mon, you CAN earn Atoms--I'm level 155, but I make a practice of hitting all the weekly and daily challenges I can. I score around 400 Atoms on a good week.  
---
However, I definitely agree: the power armor skins are INSANELY overpriced. How are they worth so much more than regular outfits?
---
Didn’t know about these things. Thanks for putting this info out.
---
Yeah hopefully the endgame loop of Wastelanders has more routes of progression. As it stands now, it's only maintenance of consumables and pulling weapons and armor out of an RNG machine.
---
Because it is literally not harmless... 
---
Did you play Fallout 4?  Mod your settlements to bypass the build limits?  Place a shit ton of lighting past what the budget would normally allow?  Take a wild guess what happens next.  
---
Now imagine you're some innocent person playing this game and you fast travel to someone's camp to visit their vending machine and as you load in the last thing you see before your PC attempts to commit suicide is just a screen full of black and orange smoke.
---
Don't overuse stimpaks, use food or drinks to heal up and be reasonable with your build. I recommend a rifleman for your first or maybe a melle build as it is most fun. Mutations can change up how you play.
---
Seriously. One of the complaints I've seen leveled against the game pretty frequently is that you can easily end up with a case of Darkness-Induced Audience Apathy from the sheer amount of times you come across seemingly-decent people who get any relentlessly positive feelings beaten out of them before they end up dead and rotting.
---
Like, I *love* the radios in Fallout games. But I've started keeping mine turned off recently because it felt so jarring against this quiet, lonely world.
---
Well fed and rejuvenated perk  increases hp further.
---
Weirdly, I got a LOT of HRF on my last nuke zone run, so I thought they had already adjusted the drop rate.
---
Yeah, since Beta.
---
It's Beth joke of network code, that's still stuck in the last century and can't handle on the fly changes to ipv6 routing.
---
If you disable IPv6 in your router (IPv6, DS, and DS-Lite) you wont be getting this error.
---
I honestly take pride in the fact I've got some of the best prices in the game, aahthankyou. 😁 LOL. I sell MOST 3 stars for 1k. 1500 at the most. ALL my plans and recipes are 10% of value. (Except ski outfit plan...) And logging off wouldnt have done much good, the player hit my camp, spammed the hell outta purchase and gone. Happened in a matter of 5 seconds. I was in the middle of "one violent night" and just said "well shit."
---
I have nv long sight on my fixer. It gives more accuracy in vats than reflex (but this has better ap).
---
They can't stop refunding, there are laws.
---
I like this.
---
also maybe- food becomes more rare as there are more people seeking/consuming.
---
Look how they just announced fixing the 250 dr effect today though? It seems like it was relatively easy for them to allocate a team to an issue that literally ruins the value of items. My point is valid.
---
Still haven’t even commented on 1st
---
I was anticipating one for the anniversary.  I guess we were both slightly off the bullseye.  Black Friday does make a lot of sense.
---
They are addressing some major issues on this one. DR bug would make some weapons useable again and I can use my gat plasma/minigun again if they fix the spin up glitch. 
---
The various VATS glitches should be next. Priority on the 98% hit chance resulting in you punching holes in the clouds instead of the target.
---
16 times the detail, -16 times the mechanics.
---
True balance.
---
I have mentioned a bunch of times that I would like to be able to craft "clutter" pieces that I can place on top of tables, dressers, etc.  Just more things to make a place look lived in.  Maybe you need to find a typewriter, a microscope, and a hotplate. These things crafted together create a "clutter pack" that I can then place on a flat surface.  They could have dozens of these that are large and small.  Things like table settings, guns and ammo laying around, food products on a counter top.  Possibilities are limitless tbh
---
Got a link that will work outside of a work firewall preventing "gaming" sites?
---
Or hell, maybe a post here with the content of the article?
---
Smart of them. Main issues are that the scrapbox should be for everyone and private worlds are the only way to really be able to complete raids without lag. But there are so many levels of opinions about this topic.
---
oh, this excuse again... Remember when they made huge profits with just selling a game (like Fallout 4) and how much work they put in a dlc like Nuka World or Far Harbor. Now they charge 18 dollars for a re-skin a developer probably needs at most a day. The value for money scale has been lost. 
---
I don't belive they are losing money with this game. There are enough wales around. Otherwise they would go free-to-play already or just shut the game down. No, the problem, i believe, is that the just don't make enough money. It's far below expectations.
---
First off I doubt anyone had 1500 lbs of flux in their stash/character. Maybe a handful of people that had multiple accounts full of junk, then decided to transfer it to their main, had even close to that much flux.
---
600 vault steel really? Again I doubt much people were hoarding vault steel, I'd imagine people would probably craft their armor piece as soon as they have enough. Not to mention has anyone even farmed 600 worth of vault steel? Thats a lot of time to get that much and not even use it seems a bit rediculous.
---
 So you basically get almost all the end game armor and all the flux you could need for having fo 1st.
---
I think the problem here is they are always ahead of themselves, a proper restore system should of been in place before rolling out paid subs. 
---
If beth wants to hand out all that junk to me for just subbing, then sure I'll sub for 1 month for all that without thinking.
---
Personally I want to see Grahm dressed up as Santa and Chally as Rudolph.
---
I like the ideas, but I dont think this is the right game. After all, I dont even aim, just hit q
---
They hated him because he spoke the truth.
---
You make a valid point. I have honestly tried to burn through my caps, but finding something worthwhile to blow them on is not easy. And I honestly have a hard time paying the price some of our "vendors" are asking. (12600 for a nocturnal wooden leg? Really?) When this happened, I was sitting at around 22k or so. I'd planned on purchasing another serum recipe after I completed the event.... Shoulda done it beforehand, apparently. Lol.
---
Except they are useless unless you run the raids?
---
I’d change it again then post your new and old passwords here just in case you forget them.
---
But again, that's where you're wrong. Something, especially intangibles are worth whatever people are willing to pay for it. I've seen people in game wearing this so that means people were willing to pay that price. If it's too expensive for you, then it's not a product that is targeted for people like you. 
---
You can buy cheap shoes, okay shoes, middle of the road shoes, pretty good shoes, excellent shoes, designer shoes or extremely exclusive shoes. Everyone makes these choices every day based on their own values. 
---
We are moving from a tangible world to a digital one, soon many people will spend more on their virtual goods than tangible ones. That's just the reality of a technology based society that uses games such as this as their personal outlets. 
---
Your problem isn't with the game, the game is a symptom of a societal trend you are aversely reactionary towards and that's fine and all.... But I think all the backlash against being willing to pay a premium for digital goods is way off and only hurts artists and limits creativity on what people are willing to put effort into. 
---
Many people like to claim that if items were less expensive they'd but them, these businesses aren't stupid, they've run the math and most have found that to be false and so the people who are willing to pay a premium for exclusive gear get the prioritized treatment. It's pretty simple. 
---
You can not convince a company by refusing to pay, you convince a company by what you pay for. A non-buyer has no value to the company. And it's kinda silly to think that you should.
---
Thank You = Thumbs Up and Sorry = Confusion ???
---
Thanks! I'm sorry that i didn't see this before.
---
MODUS online.
---
OH NO! That one extra smoke machine is too much for any computer to handle! 
---
Seriously, if your PC is dying cause of one more smoke machine, it would die when the game started to rain. Or if a pair of players used flamers near you...
---
It just works.
---
I saw a camp selling buzz blade plans for 100 c, then a different one asking 1000+ c for serums.  Some people have no future in retail.
---
lol these are launch bugs. they're never going anywhere
---
The issue in this thread, the main problem is the fact the game completely deletes atom store painted items from existence.    
---
So while it's great if the default option changes from "Yes" to "No" when you drop an item with an atom store paint, a better solution would be to ALSO remove the atom store paint, revert it to standard, and then allow the item to drop.  
---
This gives a player another chance to recover an accidentally dropped item.  The takeaway though is deleting legendary items is bad, outside of the scrip machines.
---
Yeah. The power armor equivalent of a weird art car. 
---
Which, I mean, I could totally see happening.
---
I calculated with those perks of course
---
Dude this game is just a big stinky xp grind. How can you RP?
---
I carry two suits and store seven. What are you on about? No issues here.
---
Sometimes it lags for me and doesn't show anything. I usually have to relog.
---
I’d love to hear their’s
---
most of the bugs don't impact me, so I guess I was mostly "meh"
---
Here's the issue with roleplaying in this game.  Once you get high enough level you can be anything and do everything.  They really needed to cap experience at level 76 or something.  This would force people to create new character to do different things.  I am level 210 and I can craft all the power armor, cook all the recipes, fix all the weapons, craft all the chemicals, etc.
---
They could have capped things at 50 and then afterwards allowed high level perks be unlocked that allowed special abilities.  Things like repairing armor to 200 pct durability should only be able to be done by specialized characters.  This would have allowed people to truly "role play" .

That’s called capitalism.  Ask an American if price gouging is bad and you’ll get punched in the face.  Ask a Swede and they just won’t understand why you don’t give it away to someone less fortunate.
---
I lost one of my best guns this way. Vampire mini gun with explosive rounds and decreased weight. I was so bummed. I mean it was my fault but it happened so fast, accidentally clicked the button twice. Still sour about it though.
---
I know my english wasn't well. So give me a break, pal.
---
Probably QoL
---
Nice advice. Thank you.
---
You’re misunderstanding me. I didn’t notice anything about your grammar. I just want your passwords.
---
Why is the value going to drop? And I thought that SH wasn't tradeable
---
The PA peices will be viewable in the vendor if you are currently wearing the suit.
---
There was a change that happened a month or 2 ago (maybe longer?) that unequipped all PA peices from the frame and stored it in your stash or inventory.  We all had to reequip all our frames when this update happened, so you may have been gone when it hit, which is why you saw it all unequipped.
---
You should still be able to store equipped PA frames in your stash once you reequip them with their peices.
---
My password is: whogiveacrap. 
---
There you go.
---
I didn't watch it so technically I couldn't be disappointed ;)
---
Mega cringe
---
The screams are from a machine nearby that a worker used to prank people. If you look in the area you’ll find the controls
---
The game is broken, and not worth $60, but it's fun. Especially if you have a friend to play with, it's borderline a blast at times. I feel like if you go into with those expectations you can have fun. So I'm with you on that.
---
It's not just shotguns, anything that does too many hits too quickly can trigger it. I see the bug all the time on my gatling lasers, plasma and even sometimes with my handmade. It seems to be more prevalent when the server has that laggy bullshit delay on everything like terminals.
---
You really should have numbers and unique characters in a password. Try wh0gIv3acr^p
---
If you’re a human being, your bound to make mistakes.  That’s inevitable, which is why a system like this that causes a pretty big consequence from a minor mistake is ineffective.  Yeah people who delete their weapons on accident are partly to blame, but the bigger picture is that a flaw in the process lead to the mistake.
---
I sell most common items for 50% or less of their list price, and try to keep even the best stuff reasonable, I don't sell Serums anymore as the market for them is just too soft (Vendor pays 500, players sell them for 250), I'm currently over 700K in caps, most of which came from PA Fabrication &amp; Modding services.
---
SH still tradeable! Buy now before it's too late! Lmao
---
Caps are worth what you can buy with them. You need to spend some. If your is to be a millionaire in a game about nuclear decay and caps as currency...
---
Yeah, nice. I should transform hexa code them one more to ensure remember this.
---
I also use vats almost 100% of the time.  At the very least I'd love to see the marsupial mutation fixed to allow high and low jumps.  Looking over both shoulders would also help a lot, especially for PVP.
---
Since none of that happened to me I did not need to be compensated.  Can't speak for others.
---
A few missions is NOT gonna turn things anywhere but down
---
I believe you are right, I hoard everything and noticed the same thing - although I don't have much need for flux at the moment, I do remember thinking the same thing a week or 2 ago.
---
Now we are talkin! Have a great weekend and seriously I hope the other comment below of the ipv6 issue solves your problem. 
---
See you in the wastelands!
---
The mannequins could be a way for synths of one form or another to appear. The interloper would be a great, creepy Lovecraft inspired quest line.
---
That is where I put it, thanks again!
---
Thanks for the info - do you think it would be possible to keep this list more accurately and widely updated? It would be great to see.
---
Isn't it just a small version of the mechanical thing from the brotherhood ending in FO4 that they use to destroy the institute.?
---
I have never noticed that, as soon as I start shooting, her health starts draining, doesn't matter if I'm fighting my self or 15 people are. I did remember reading from the data miners that she didn't scale.

If you're on xbox I have a couple of medics explosive revolvers I'll sell for cheap

&amp; If ya take the pieces off,you can name the power armor chassis,re-equip the pieces &amp; store away,wit a conveniently named,easily findable suit of PA.
---
Kinda dope honestly
---
I will say I've finally been able to play over 2 hours without a crash. This is the first time I can say this since initial launch. I'm starting to see some stability in the game. Please don't go backwards!!
---
I had a medieval character. It's fun for a while. Use a sword, leather armor, no fusion cores, no laser.
---
They will make none trully happy, but they will make everyone less unhappy... at this point FO1sters are still hated, so, when they gain scraps the free community will complain...
---
... the 1sters will be busy grouping and deflecting all the hate, they will not have too much time to think they received less of what they lost. (I mean, the ones that really lost that much)
---
Also most 1ster likely didn't lost that much... and they will be "kinda happy".
---
No, if someone comes at you with a gun, and your praying and spraying while jumping around with a m79 just means you can’t challenge me with a gun as far as i see. The abuse comes from every player who uses it. It’s a crutch for way to many players, high levels too. I’m not wanting to remove heavy weapons perk cards and that’s unbalancing all heavys and that’s not the exclusive problem. Deffo needs to be taken out all together or nerfed to the point where the demand to use it is reduced.
---
Awesome, thanks guys. Great responses. I will be busy today running a few silos on both private and public to see if I notice anything. Cheers.
---
All the best and most critically acclaimed games don’t have that shit, because games don’t need it. Some companies view game as art, while others use them to exploit others. And they are inching their way forward and trying what we let them get away with. 
---
For example Bethesda said all items in the shop will be strictly cosmetic and won’t affect gameplay. Then they backtracked on that under some shitty excuse of listening to the community. And then after delaying wastelanders they introduced FO first membership, which locks gameplay features behind paywall. They also said that they can’t increase storage space because of server problems, but it doesn’t seem to be the case anymore all of a sudden. 
---
And that’s just few of many examples.
---
yes, I am role playing as a power hungry warlord.  If you pay me a protection fee of 1000 caps per week, I won't send my mercenaries.
---
I did, Bethesda never replied. Changed my password. Lost 200 scrips and they won't reply to my ticket after a week.
---
There was a bug causing armor to not take damage and it is now fixed. It now takes damage as it was supposed to.
---
Play with friends
---
Sometimes it’s not even the exclusivity, it’s the brand name itself, especially in the couture fashion industry. Flexing an off-white hoodie that’s still available in stores is all about the brand name and how it’s gained value as a brand.
---
It's the pointless, doesn't-benefit-them screwings like this that surprise me. Bethesda gains nothing from this, there was no reason for it other than spite.
---
Name a modern AAA game that's been released that is the size and scope of a game like Bethesda makes that doesn't offer optional paid content.
---
Santa Grahm! Please!
---
Let the deathclaw be the Grinch
---
Thanks! what is your ign so I can come find you?
---
Beth sure know how to give us a panic move.
---
Holding a nuka colabviously
---
Did you lose anything?
---
With those annoying ass jingle bells. That would be awesome.
---
I'd prefer action instead of nice articles, but that's possibly just me.
---
I'm curious if you just have the 1 character? I have 4 and anytime I get 20-25k I do a ton of shopping at player vendors or just buy a serum recipe for one of my other chars. Hopefully with Wastelanders there will be something else to spend caps on, but atm that's what I do
---
I think your point is well explained and your point is very valid.
---
The workshop buffer definitely needs to happen.  If a player takes the time to kill the enemies, pay the caps, claim the bench, set up a workshop then they need to be protected for an hour from take over.  Sorry PVP'rs ( I am one of you ) but there are players that deserve to be rewarded for their time investment.  Most of the time people challenge a ws they just do it for the PVP and not to actually use the workshop.  That causes a lot of players to leave the game if you ask me, especially low level and young players.  It really isn't fair.  The same goes for the high level that claims every workshop on the map and does nothing with them.  If a player takes a bench and doesn't build on the resource extractor they should lose the bench after 10 minutes.  Something like that anyways.
---
Do you think B has logs of these losses.. put in a ticket.. get on the list.. If they had logs they could have reversed out the losses.
---
And now you have to pay to turn other players (except friends list folks) off. Fun stuff.
---
How often are you reviving other people? If youre doing we as a tank/healer, others should be alive pretty consistently so any perks that are based on reviving people could be a waste.  I would put 2 more into supressor because 30% damage reduced goes a long way.
---
Fallout Dev: The Santa Claws!! Write it down! Lets lock it behind another Pay Wall!!

Thanks for the details!

My camp is a trailer park and a couple days ago I was visited by a player with  "Trailer Park" and a job title in his name. I was so excited for some interaction but I guess he/she didn't have a mic. They just repeatedly sawed me with a chainsaw.
---
I told this character I currently had no openings for a gardener but they were welcome to leave a resume. 
---
Got sawed again and received a You've Been Insulted note in a bag.
---
Mic up, people! Can't be the NPCs if we can't communicate *insert reminder to Bethesda that text chat or a messaging system would be nice to have on PC*
---
I hope they didn't forget about that strangler heart / beta wave tuner lock up and crash...
---
I heard I'm selling sh pa if anyones untreated
---
The Grognakains! I forgot throwing weapons... could use molotovs! Pretty sure fire bombs were a thing in medieval times
---
Random encounter on Savage Divide. Raider Power Armor left with a message.
---
What is that one?
---
what??? is sh pa
---
That I get I figured something was wrong there but the limb damage is definitely an issue. Even before the glitch of armor not taking damage limb damage was not this bad.
---
Right at 0:45

Burying barrels of money.
---
Careful now, they might make us pay for it
---
But they are not. Lore isn’t what NW is about, it’s a separate gamemode. It’s Bethesda’s choice to do that, so why change a core gameplay element for the sake of you being too lazy to change your build.
---
Strangler Heart power armor. He's spamming your thread.
---
Nice. Yes, shouldn't let us pick up a duoe in the first place.
---
You mean how the trailers made it seem like a complete/polished game?
---
Not spamming anyone
---
Automatic weapons sometimes have issues with rubber band health bars as well. I have experienced this with my .50 HMG. Switching weapons is the only way to actually fix it once I have engaged an enemy that I have the issue with. It's inconsistent though. Some nights I don't have any issues at all,  other nights it seems like it happens quite often.
---
is RAIDER POWER ARMOR not strangler heart

Next patch notes: "We fixed the +50 Damage Resist while aiming bug."
---
I hear that. My GF saved me once from that, but I've done it more times than I can count. My snare drum was saved tho! I was all happy about finding it, telling her all about how i was gonna slap that baby in a display case, and I wish my actual IRL snare drum was that nice looking, blah blah blah...not even 2 minutes later she saw me hitting the bench at a train station and casually remarks "You're gonna scrap that snare drum..." like a millisecond before I hit the button. I guess I'll keep her around
---
Completely agree. The actual idea was a lot more ambitious than the final product.
---
Thanks! yeah I called them this morning and they refunded all the purchases.
---
o.0 sure it triggers me... Actually what annoys me is that I enjoyed PvP in this game and it's basically been all but banned from the game because of people who can't keep up crying about it.
---
I posted about this yesterday, it is a huge issue now. I'm getting stagger locked for 3-5 seconds at a time too. All just recently.
---
I laughed really hard at this.  Thank you, I needed that this afternoon.
---
Project: Eat Appalachia!! Slap on your Cannibal perk cards and chow down on your favorite corpses to make way for the new NPCs, you don't want them to catch the Whoopsies from rotting carcasses lying about!!
---
Hmm. So looks like mmogfails was dead on. Wastelanders will make or break them. 
---
I really hope you are wrong and it's not a buggy mess. Still, if they are putting all their eggs in one basket, why not let us test that basket?
---
I will test things for free. I'm sure most people on here would love to actually help.
---
Bethesda, please use your community!
---
  Defiance is Line in the Sand, which is good for taking out SBs and getting a fusion core or two, as well as home to the various color Asylum workers outfits.
---
Glass caverns is Ultracite and lots of high XP critters.
---
If you see people gathering around v9, its possible someone is prepping a nuke launch; anticipating that, you go there.
---
  As to general 'escort', even though L60s can do a lot, there are happenings in the Bog that can be quite overwhelming.  To that end, it's possible someone is tagging along with you to provide assistance if needed (and to get hits in on legendaries you may stir up).  
---
  If you've ever had the pleasure of being triple-teamed by L80 SBs, you know exactly what I mean.
---
I think it's too late for any test servers to aid in the development of Wastelanders. Maybe in the polishing stages for immediate patches and bug fixes afterwards. That and I don't think they want to reveal all the quests / SP stuff.
---
Bone hammer or club whatever!
---
No shit, captain.
---
Yaaaaas
---
just had an image of a deathclaws and SBs in santa hats...
---
I thought they fixed this a few patches ago. Is it back again?
---
i would love to but gamechat is fucked and barely works on console
---
Not sure if it’s still a thing but I remember in a previous version of Windows that the BSOD vanished in favor of auto reset and that it was possible to turn it off. 
---
I think they did it because the BSOD isn’t helpful to the average person. 
---
Hope it helps.
---
shut your ass up
---
There is this thingy normally in your right hand.. It's called a mouse. Just follow the cable connected to the computer..

It will make some happy, or at least less ragequitty.

As someone who lost 9 months of collecting junk, loosing more than 10,000 points, the above is less then 1/100th of some of what I had stockpiled, with the exception of Vault Steel, that was lost.  
---
I'm not happy, but am satisfied they are doing **something**...
---
The mid levels, 30-ish to 50 are the harder.
---
Agreed. Hell, I would sub for another mo the of Fallout 1 at for those things. 
---
My sub expires next month, and I don't plan to sub again unless they give us something cool.
---
Under rated comment here. 
---
This is what I did.
---
I should visit sometime. My camp is near the meat shack. The Redneck inn lol
---
You can not get bloodied and two shot on the same weapon, they both take the same slot.
---
You can get bloodied explosive, though to my understanding faster fire rate is better in the Queen since she has a very high explosive resistance
---
happy to help!
---
There have been 5 NW sub's created that I know of. Good luck with yours, hope it gains players and I'll join even tho I only play NW when they bring in new rewards
---
are you over including when Perk cards and Legendary effects are removed?  
---
It's frustrating as hell....
---
Probably just bloodied explosive gatling laser. It's good but not "destroying her like it's nothing" good.

Everyone's gangsta till the molerat comes strapped n packing
---
Sweet! I lost some junk and had more than I lost restored already. Can't wait for this to happen too lol.
---
That sends shivers down my spine
---
i appreciate that dude. i have noticed there were a few. but seemed pretty inactive. i’m still pretty new to reddit but will try and keep it as updated as possible.
---
I wish there was a “shut the fuck to and stop making this post” emote
---
You aren't satisfied with the puke and pvp emotes?
---
Gotta be more efficient than me waiting for her to land and getting 12 swings in before before she takes off.
---
About time they address the +250 DR bug....
---
It would be hilarious to see a mole miner shooting a two shot fat man at you.
---
Probably a bug in the system, SEE NOT ALL BUGS ARE BAD!!!1!! Lol sry had to
---
I’ve tried a ts Gatling plasma but it didn’t seem to do much at all.
---
I'd 2nd this and add that some food add bonuses like additional melee damage, strength, carry weight (last 2 are considered different and stack even though both increase carry weight) and last for 30min as opposed to a couple of minutes like chems. 
---
Two shot is a prefix, like Bloodied so you can’t have both. Two shot is also pretty mediocre, so I’d avoid them.  
---
If you’re looking for the best heavy/bloodied weapons for the SBQ, the best weapon will be a legacy BE Gatling Plasma.  Second best would be a legacy BE Gatling Laser. 
---
If those are not an option, then your best choices will be either BE or B25 LMGs or Miniguns. The SBQ does have strong explosion resists, but it doesn’t really matter with any of these weapons since you will be doing extremely high damage.
---
??
---
That would mean every time you find a key you have to scroll through your list (which is usually long) to see if you already have the key. A better way would be to simply allow players to drop or scrap duplicates
---
It isn't
---
Does it just not work? Or is there something specific wrong with it? Pardon my lack of knowledge.
---
Lol, not entirely.
---
I did the dromedary thing for a bit. It helps.
---
Then I took it off. It's not needed. I do run thru-hiker and travelling pharmacy though.
---
My suggestion is boiled water. Lots of boiled water. Maybe even hotkey it. Between big enemy kills, open to your aid (keep it around the boiled water section if you can between use) and drink.
---
Yes, purified water is nice. But boiled water is easier to get. Boil up 50 water, drink up 45 of it, boil some more. Always pick up wood. Keep an eye on your boiled water, make more whenever you're low and near a cooking spot.
---
I'll probably phase out the weight reduction perks as I use up my stockpile, or not, it depends. I eat meat, I drink boiled water, and I only use diluted stims (my perk uses regular stims when I'm in danger). I pop chems every fight.
---
Also I keep nuka-cola, cream, inert flux, in small amounts for emergency water. Same with a couple bits of old-war food. I get a lot of meat just running around, and always keep my boiled water stocked, so I basically never need emergency supplies.
---
Awesome. I’ll be on the hunt for one then. Thx
---
And most people don’t know that the +250 bug gives that benefit to you 100% of the time if you stay crouched after reloading....or until you standup.
---
Pretty sure having that effect and being hit (someone correct me) would make your main legendary effect void unless you were crouching.
---
Yea its called liberty prime there is no liberty prime power armor variant.
---
Most of them have died off pretty quick. Make a post every once and a while to try and grab fresh players. And maybe try and message/tell players you meet ingame
---
What will we be defending our territory from
---
Chameleon stealthed bloodied built supermutant commando? The forums would crash over the rageposts
---
Same here. 
---
They have been working on some bugs for months. No need to hold off on fixing them till Wastelanders.
---
Yeah quite a while ago
---
Oh ya.. And why is there a weapon that the Swap to last weapon likes even though you never equipped it?
---
You know how hard it is to have something running at you that is legendary, but you want to swap back to a non bloodied weapon to give others the chance to tag without killing it. but it swaps to another bloodied instead so you have to use it or die.
---
Select tesla, select Bloodied 5mm..... shoot.. shoot..  Swap to tesla but it either chooses...
---
 my Syringer (Which was not in the rotation,so I have to swap back to my 5mm or die)
---
or
---
my bloodied  Sniper (Which was not in the rotation, so I have use it or die)
---
I read you.
---
If you're at your camp that often, sure. Some of us don't go back to camp for days at a time.
---
If you can get one of the legacy BE GPs, the damage is significantly higher than any gun in the game.  I mean seriously higher!  They have been highly duped at this point, so there are many out there too.  Well at least on the PC they are pretty common now.
---
Lol I missed that one. 
---
Oy. They don't even know their own bugs.
---
Agreed. There's not much room for an economy if an individual is completely self-sufficient in every regard. Stories about Mary Sues are the most boring because weakness is what makes us interesting.
---
Most often for me it's a tiny jump with the jetpack sound. Pretty lame. You basically lose the ability to jump and can only use the jetpack.
---
Cool. I’m gonna hit up the marketplace for a new toy.
---
How did you get her to stay on the ground?
---
You can name the chassis with the armor pieces already on it too.
---
I’d like to see a schorcbeast Queen using a instigating explosive black powder rifle lol
---
The only downside, is you will blow yourself up a TON. There is a learning curve with a weapon that explodes that many times per second. So it’s hard to use this type of gun in tight areas.
---
It's ok, they won't charge you extra for this feature !
---
Booze and food, what more do you need?
---
Then you would never see a ton of legendaries since no enemy use them like gatlings,railways. 
---
Also what would be the correct legendary for animals?
---
Really? 4v1 and if I lose that’s on me? Lol.
---
Ohh noo you dont want that, it's all fun and games until your armor and weapon is broken from a super mutant using a TSE. 
---
Man I remember how happy I was in fallout 4 because you can tell your getting shot by explosive rounds being used by the legendary  until I got killed and the legendary despawned lol
---
Ah yes. I remember that problem back when tse ruled the wasteland.
---
One of my favorite random encounters in the game.
---
No you
---
Deathclaw yielding grognak axe? Hell yes.
---
A cunning plan - Baldrich
---
You cannot be that stupid.   Your scenario only works if they left every item in the atom shop permanently. They don’t.  
---
2100 atoms does nothing if it takes more time to earn them than the item is even up in the store.  
---
The Rider power armors were what like 14/1500 atoms.  They were in the store for 7 days.   But I’m sure you have a great mathematical explanation for how someone starting with 0 atoms could achieve that in five days sans purchasing atoms.
---
I miss 4 when the enemies actually made you shit yourself, like Quincy or the GNR fatman dudes.
---
B R A V E
---
I agree I use the thumbs up and heart.
---
It’s even worse than that, just because this particular gun does so much damage and that many explosions.  It doesn’t matter if you have Fireproof 3 either, it’s just too much.  So while it’s an insanely powerful weapon, it’s dangerous to use. It’s worth it though!
---
It comes down to your perks then.
---
My melee build dose 5 to 7 k base damage.
---
If you use One Gun Army or other similar perks and cripple all limbs (wings, arms, legs) she will stay still.
---
I agree that the be plasmas are great on the Queen I'm hitting her for like 30 dmg, with full adrenaline in the face, for 5 pellets each
---
My Bffr 50 cal dose 80 dmg per hit, full adrenaline in the face
---
Both are great guns that I can see her health bar dropping when I lay into her
---
Daaaaang
---
The technical reason is that this is another part of the game ruined by multiplayer. Each player has their own random loot from each enemy so they can't just be weilding the same weapon you get from them for every player. 
---
It did operate this way in Fallout 4 where some random raider might hit you with an explosive shotgun out of nowhere and murder your ass, which was fun as it added another layer of risk to human legendary enemies. Would be a hell of a lot more interesting if they brought this back with wastelanders but I doubt it.
---
I mean you can get around that, but its pain in the ass when using several weapons...
---
Dont shoot at the queen in the air she will land more frequent
---
True I do have cards split between fist and two handed so I’m not getting the huge huge boosts. I should probably commit.
---
I agree it’s annoying, but it was exploitable at the same time.  Most people just don’t know you can exploit the bug.
---
Tie it in to a vid channel of your matches.  You might gain some traction.
---
When you reload, the 250 DR kicks in, but it removes the primary effect (e.g. Bloodied, Furious, Vampire's, etc) from your weapon. This is only fixed once you swap to a different weapon and back.
---
To avoid it, you have to crouch every time you reload and for some reason this prevents the primary effect from being removed.
---
i do stream on twitch but don’t save my past broadcasts. i do have some funny clips though. i will try and look to do this. thanks for letting me know
---
Thank you for the good work you do.
---
bro thats plenty! i appreciate the gift and if you ever need mats or anything hit me up! i shall return the favor!
---
The thing is that the m79 sucks without frog logs. Without freg leg it's just a grenade on impact and not totally unavoidable. I wasn't saying remove heavy weapon perks, but take away the explosive weapons from benefitting, they're their own class of weapon
---
For the meanwhile, have a clip of a noob tuber genuinely blowing himself and his team mate back to main menu 😂😂 https://clips.twitch.tv/CuteImpartialFiddleheadsMingLee
---
This is the real problem, my vendors have been shuttered for a week with nothing to sink my caps on.
---
One other thing, it’s very inexpensive to use these weapons too.  Prime it, and make the Ultracite ammo.  I used maybe 60 yellowcake and I have ammo that will last me for 6 months+.
---
Radstags for reindeer!
---
I sell 99% of plans for 76 caps, with the super common and super rare being either tossed on a “free stuff” table or set at 7676 caps.  Sometimes I sell deathclaw hides, neurotoxic dust or other rare junk, but I stopped selling legendaries, ammo and serums entirely.  I have very little use for caps, and scrip is a far more valuable currency.  With a private server, I just save ammo and swap it to a character that can use it.
---
i will try and promote it in stream too. but yes good thinking the PS4 community i come across i will tell. hopefully people can spread the word on other platforms. thanks for your input
---
They fixed it, then it broke again.
---
It has been broken for the past 2 patches.
---
I have no idea what the hell they are doing over there.
---
I did uranium fever a bunch of times in a matter of a few hours on private server, i don't know what the time tables actually are but i feel like it was active a lot during my 2 hours of game time. I will have to look when i get home but i think i did it 4 times, haven't scripted any legendaries i got from it yet
---
Sounds more like you don't know what you are talking about. As you can easily google "Ip release renew" and you'll find hundreds of thousands of links showing how to change your IP addresses. 
---
Hell, a static IP costs 500$ just to set up, that is why no one has them:
---
https://www.verizonwireless.com/businessportals/support/faqs/DataServices/faq_static_ip.html
---
Thank you 😊 The exploit in the video I submitted was actually patched!! They fixed it in the patch we just got 😊😊😊
---
Rough.
---
 This is dumb. Oh well its popular, ;(
---
I suppose its not the explosive weapon issue solely. I just dont like that alot of fighter are first to hit. We're not playing sniper v sniper.
---
Hey! I don't have FO1st...
---
... that means I got it free? OH MY! S2
---
I never won a thing for free... *tears*
---
I got that a few times when I accidentally pulled the network cable out of my laptop. Maybe you have a network issue.
---
Why?
---
She's got CHA, like Grahm, and even mutations can't keep her from trying to make sales.
---
Yes, I will mock people who are supporting this greed from bethesda that is hurting this game. You are absolutely correct I'm going to laugh at idiots who buy stupid things. Just like every other person on the planet does.
---
I mean have you never seen all the jokes about people who wear crocs, tap out shirts, etc?
---
Welcomes to the real world.
---
Why did you buy the game, then?
---
So the prime ammo last longer? How have played this game for 760 hours and don’t know this stuff??
---
Any thoughts on an extremely expensive shop for rare items, cosmetics, and etc not found in the atoms shop.. Good gold sink, good way to show off wealth.. Maybe some actual useful armors and weapons, but nothing extremely OP. Id pay top caps for some really unique paints and skins.. Not real cash, but caps.. I think the Wastelander update will bring a higher cap limit and some more end-game gold sink vendors.. Or, here's to hoping.
---
Yes, a static IP costs extra, but they're changed on a schedule, usually in months or years, and absolutely not in response to end user activity like a simple release/renew on your device, whether it's a computer or router. You can change your local IP, but not your modem's.
---
Either a BE gp or B25 50 cal for heavy guns. Bloodied Dcg or Pf while sneaking would do the most damage
---
I just carry 25 Inert Flux all the time and Ionized meat (never goes bad).
---
Not much you can do about the buggy coding on this one. I can drink full and eat full.. server hop and I'm already at 25% or near dying.
---
I posted about this in the comments section.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dzmipw/bethesda_please_tell_us_that_you_know_about_the/
---
But yeah, they are either really bad at their jobs or just don't care.
---
Neither option is good.
---
Thanks! Gotta put the trophies somewhere right? 😂
---
It's not that it dose so much damage for blowing yourself up. Legacy guns actulay ignor fireproof and dense mods
---
It depends on the weapon, but it’s pretty efficient with the Gatling Plasma. I think you make the equivalent of 1,050 per flux (not counting super duper).
---
LOL, you absolutely can change them with an "IP release renew" command or just cycling your router. It is why I told you to google that phrase.
---
I have first, have not lost anything,  did not receive the email. Sighz. 75 violet flux would have been nice!
---
The legendary weapon stat with extra 10% damage while aiming should qualify. I've been wondering if this affects vats damage.
---
r/cringe
---
Has anyone proven this?  I’ve heard it both ways.  I tend to believe it’s true based on my experience.
---
except the plans are the easiest thing  to get from the raids? Guaranteed drop is kind of a thing
---
 For me, the shrieking skulls are shocking my soul.
---
Assualtron with a legendary laser face XD Oh gods why!?
---
Agreed.
---
that whistle noise was complete terror, like WHERE IS HE WHERE IS HE WHERE IS HE
---
&gt;It sounds like they're sending it to FO1st members who played during the period it was bugged.
---
Nope. I played during that period, have not received any email, more's the pitty
---
Yeah mine is showing offline too. It only shows items I already purchased.
---
Was bloodied and wasn’t doing nearly as much dmg as I wanted, but then found out you could sneak attack the queen, so not I just crouch the entire fight and do  a ton more dmg when sneak critical proc
---
I would assume its true. Because even with the massive amount of dmg they do, with the 90% reduction from fireproof 3 and 50% from dense you still shouldn't feel a thing
---
good news: bugs that have been around since beta are being fixed!!  bad news: it took over a YEAR to fix bugs that have been around since beta!!
---
Yeah as much as i want depth and a shift in balance i know its gonna be fetch quests and 1 public event where we kill something for a 1 star legendary. The game will itself never change.
---
i just find it funny that its been a year and these bugs are still in the game lol
---
they better have a shitload of shit fixed when Wastelanders comes out, because that'll bring back people like me who deleted this shit to want to play it again and give it a second chance
---
This is the second solo SBQ run I've seen on here today, and again I say: Congrats, that's awesome!! 
---
But did it pop the challenge of killing a large creature?? In my best Inigo Montoya voice "I must know"
---
As bullshit as that would be, it is sort of looking like that's where things are going.
---
Wait I got free vault steel? That'd be great for that trash raid I'll never do.
---
You can charge prime core up to 350 rounds. It takes 2 cores, 1 yellow cake, and 1 Ultracite. With ammo Smith 2 you make 3 cores. A pop
---
Hello i myself run a full strength heavy weapon/melee build and if you're a looking for weapons to use against the queen with a melee the only way is through sneak attack hits with heavy chem boosts.
---
However if you have your strength at 15 you can invest into a heavy gunner perk cards aswell and run both a melee build and a heavy gunner build. The best heavy weapons to use against the queen are a BE/BFF. 50 cal/gatling gun or gatling plasma. 
---
A legacy bloodied explosive plasma can do high amounts of damage if you shoot the ground instead of the queen. But since its very hard to get id recommend buying a bffr or be .50 cal since its dmg output against the queen is great. 
---
Hope this was of some use to you.
---
Yup. Hundreds of Vault Steel!
---
I was thinking the same thing. They've been around since launch, and documented since launch. But Bethesda is going to fix them now? Why now, what's different? I'll wait and hope, but I'm not gonna hold my breath.
---
And that is the true definition of anxiety; combat music/noises with no enemy in sight
---
If there's an Atomic Shop bug they will fix it within the day, don't worry.
---
I feel seen.
---
I probably will! Thank you for the advice and tips!
---
I've been trying to be apart of a team that does the raids for ages so if you still need someone I'm your dude. I have a good build and a mic.
---
Except once you get a full set of any of the plans you have a possibility to not get a plan from the raid
---
See I would've never known that otherwise and the game doesn't give a good description at all of what exactly we should be looking for. Sorry for the confusion!
---
Sounds good to me pal :) add me
---
&gt;I'll alternate bombs between a high mob density area for those mats, 
---
Where are you nuking for mats, WS? High rad fluids are the bane of my existence...I seem to get ~8:1 glowing/hardened mass to high Rad fluids...
---
I totally forgot about that challenge. It did not complete :-(
---
I understand your premise but I think players would be more understanding of technical issues if the game wasn’t so over-monetized. Skyrim has game breaking issues at launch although they were not super common. SSE also has serious issues at launch, and so did FO4, and people raged sure, but it was not like it is with 76. And I think that is because none of those games were over-monetized. Knowing that the monetization is due to some questionable relationship/deal between Zenimax and some venture capital firm type company just makes it worse. If they are going to monetize then don’t have all the same issues you had before you did over monetize, also release more “free” content more frequently, because as of now, it’s a lot of monetization and I do not see ANY tangible benefit being returned to the player in the form of investing in and improving the game.
---
Will do! It's the same name as my reddit one when you're on the lookout for it
---
Ooh thanks. Played this since launch and still didn't know this.
---
I spent 500 last night. I'll have no trouble getting back to that by the time the sale kicks off.
---
I'm still not sure why this is a problem.  It's never bothered me.... I'd rather they fix just about anything else than waist time on that.  Maybe a patch that helps AMD players not freeze or crash or fix the damage bug or fix the friends menu that shows you in main menu when you are not.
---
Or I dont know pick literally anything else 
---
Stop picking them up end off problem.
---
True, it's the "we can do whatever we want to, we have a loyal fanbase." Attitude.
---
I still want talking Deathclaws again ;-;
---
Idk, for me, grinding to complete the story just rubs me the wrong way. I don't know what it is. I've been told this a couple of different times though so I guess I've just gotta learn some patience with this game. Thanks for the suggestions!
---
ESO made a huge comeback after a big revision several years ago.. 76 could easily be a great game. I personally love it. That said, Im still relatively new at lvl 65 and haven't explored the entire wasteland or completed all quest.. Id like to see factions return.. Joining up and earning faction specific rewards with benefits.. Benefits where it may take people from different factions  with those different rewards to better complete very difficult raids.. Real world bosses or faction wars could be cool.. Id maybe like to see new equipment that hasnt appeared in previous lore.. Why no native american references? Mutated ginseng? Mutated fish and not just mirelurks.. Weird wood framed power armor some redneck put together for shits and giggles.. Gimme a bohemoth yao gaui.. Are there centuars in this like fo3? Idk im tired and spitballing..
---
Added :)
---
cap at level 50, offer champion point like system?
---
LoL. yeah people are hurting the game from buying PA skins. do you even believe your own bullshit or are you just trying to justify yourself “mocking” people just to feel good about yourself. 
---
welcome to the real world indeed
---
I'm not even sure what exactly I can appropriate to my level actually. I've no clue what's appropriate to my level and what isn't. Thanks for the tips though!
---
Inb4 the four "use this at the atom shop" items given away by Bethesda to Fallout 1st members.
---
Don’t forget scorched radstag for reindeer
---
Thank you! Tips are greatly appreciated!
---
&gt; You would've had to move materials from a mule to your main and then lost them in the box for it to have been that big a loss.
---
I think a lot of people did exactly that,  I know I did. However I didn't lose anything,  nor did I get an email, more's the pitty, 75 of each flux would have been nice!
---
Sounds like an AWS issue when you combine that knowledge that Netflix has issues right now too
---
I’ll have to look into that as you are right, I just can’t do enough DPS or TDO to the queen.
---
What did your build look like?
---
ATM, my bloody pistol build is:
---
- S 3
---
- P 8
---
- E 4
---
- C 4
---
- I 8 (Will move a few more from here when I can get a lower level gunsmith perk card again...I accidentally combined to make level 5)
---
- A 15
---
- L 15
---
Heavily weighted towards to VATS crits and aiming but has serendipity, dodgy, ironclad, blocker, and evasive, to try and stay alive.  Full unyielding armour with bloody western and black powder pistol.  (The second annihilates everything but the queen with a crit headshot lol).
---
I’m sure I could boost my damage with food, chems, and bobbleheads, for the queen fight but with a good group I just run crowd control after doing enough to the queen to get loot while she gets smashed with heavy weapons.
---
In a not so good group I can’t do enough damage to her to make a big enough difference.
---
Sorry for the ramble, I just had my adhd medication.
---
This needs to be up voted a billion times over.!!!
---
&gt;This is a way to 'please' even those not affected by the glitch.
---
Sorry, that's simply not true. I have FO1st, I played during the period of the glitch,  I did not lose anything...and I did not get an email, so I'm not getting any freebies here
---
\^this
---
Explain to me how that legendary bloatfly is supposed to use a fat man.
---
and you will still have them all WELL before you get the steel to craft SH
---
Every Tuesday’s and Thursday’s, seem it’s probably being updated 🤷🏽‍♂️
---
Fallout 1st was the last straw
---
Sorry, I honestly read through your post but my brain must have just disregarded the last bit :(
---
One of my turrets jammed firing last night and the noise wouldn’t stop even after fast travel away and back.
---
And I was still being stalked by a (empty unfortunately) government aid box.  It’s just drop out the sky every time right near me on fast travel.
---
I still love this game,
---
So you run it again? I've never met a single person who had the 162 steel necessary to make a full set before actually having all the plans. Theres no defending this.
---
...but in game it will actually subtract 50 DR while not aiming.
---
There were more than 2 but anyone who submitted a ticket about it got the characters restored.
---
A long quest chain based grind as opposed to a item/plan farm to piece it together plus maybe some random fix it up quests that would pop up every now and then
---
Itd take some major reworking though if not a new area completely, damage would have to be balanced, loot mechanics changed so your not having to land/search bodies etc unless its only used as a call in air support type thing we have now with certain workshops
---
Shocking. I feel shocked. Also: $&amp;CK
---
Thanks for the info! Wasn't sure if they added more content to it than what was already there
---
Did you get this backwards.
---
" realized why I'm so terrible in 3rd person. "
---
Just like the canvas bag false marketing
---
You’re right.
---
I meant they didn’t place the nuke right FOR me to be effective.
---
It wasn’t the “optimum” position.
---
I had a blast doing it and enjoyed it immensely.  It was great to get my butt handed to me again...which is honestly why I made this pistol build in the first place.
---
If I wanted easy I’d use my bloody stealth commando or just use bloody pipe pistol/rifle on my pistol build.
---
Sorry it sounded like I was complaining about the placement, I was I guess, but I didn’t want to imply it upset me or “ruined” things.
---
Did you do both Nuka paints (Cola and Quantum) and the Alien blaster?
---
I could see it as a method of fast travel for those that are not able to utilize normal FT (overencumbered).    
---
OTOH, something that large couldn't exactly be stuffed into a backpack.... if clear space for a good LZ is limited,  parking could be a problem. 
---
Use in combat.....air traffic control over say, v9, would be a nightmare.
---
I love Bethesda games, but fixing bugs isn’t their strong point and never has been.
---
Commit to it, I get to 2k damage with my sheep staff combined with nerd rage 
---
That str stat man
---
Yeah i have all three, I just don’t know how to get the dome key to get the blaster rounds

The perks and possible legendary items are different than past games.  Use the above resources to learn about how the game mechanics function, what the perks do, and plan your character build in advance.  Don't be one of those people posting on this sub "I'm level 50 and I can't kill anything, help!!"
---
You answered your own question. It is a seperate game mode. The special arrangement you have in NW should be seperate, because it is a separate game mode.
---
There are far more valid reasons for not changing your special in adventure than laziness for NW.
---
What I would really like is to be able to scrap all that junk ammo that I dont use for lead/steel/gunpowder/nuclear material....or I can just continue to drop .38/40mm/mini nukes etc everywhere I go
---
Who the heck ever said that? Not me. All ever stated was how many items you could achieve in a month's time doing challenges, not how you could get 1500 Atoms in a week. So. my "scenario" works just fine for people who want to earn Atoms for free. **Which was all that I was talking about.** Just like the original post I responded to:
---
&gt; Ok, get to level 200 and let's see how many atoms you're able to earn weekly
---
Which, again, was all that I was talking about. You are the one inferring that I was speaking about how to get power armor that was available for a week or two with only the free Atoms you could earn in that time. Which I was not, nor was the OP. 
---
And I don't understand how having 2100 free atoms a month "does nothing" for you when a limited time item comes up. If anything, by doing the challenges you have a pretty good opportunity to buy it because... you already have them saved up. So if you did 4 weeks of all challenges already and the Rider armor comes up for 1400 and you have 2100+, you can buy it since you already have the funds. 
---
Also, since I apparently have to spell everything out for you, that means if you didn't have atoms saved, then you will have to buy some to get the armor. No, you will not be able to simply do the weekly challenges to get that many free atoms in the short amount of time. This concept also works in real life: if you save money for a long period of time, you can afford to buy expensive things for yourself that you wouldn't be able to afford with what you can make in a weeks' time. But, you would have understood that if you just read what I posted, instead of calling me stupid and going off on a tangent about something I never wrote.
---
Maybe math or reading comprehension aren't your strong suits, but that's okay. I'm sure you're great at some stuff, and that what makes us all unique and interesting.
---
Fallout 4 is a single player game that doesn't require online servers and support. It isn't an excuse, it is a fact
---
Dude, it's Bethesda. It will be a buggy mess, just like the rest of the game one year after launch.
---
I feel like the majority of people who play this game love to play it solo and likely don't want to interact with anyone unless they're at a camp or event.  I've played since launch and can count how many times someone tried to interact with me (beyond emotes) on one hand.
---
Your good 🤣
---
Something like that. Or make some of the better perks be locked behind prerequisites or something.
---
Are you saying you have those weapons, and wish there were more uniquely named weapons as rewards, or are you saying you know they exist, but you don't have them, and need to know which missions/where to go to get them?
---
Not working on PS4 either so I guess it's being updated.
---
If you want more damage with you melee perk for sneak attacks and you can get well above 10k with sneak headshots with most unarmed weapons and consumables. If you want something for ranged I use a prime bloodied gatling plasma when she is flying around. Bloodied heavy weapons with aim damage or faster fire rate will do good damage.
---
The Christmas death law will cost 666 atoms to summon and will look like cramped. He will also drop a middle finger.
---
a redesign can happen, they did it in ESO.
---
Oh yeah I forgot, making problematic things a non-issue is obviously bad for the game.
---
Because Shotguns were my alternate, it was fairly easy to slot in support for melee because both rely on Strength.
---
The thing you are probably overlooking is stealth.  As long as you can maintain stealth, you can benefit from the Ninja perk which triples your melee damage.  Agility is a bit of a mess for pistol users, but if you resign to having an alternate melee build for the SBQ, you can easily slot in Ninja and Sneak if you need it.  Having 5x Unyielding already gives you extremely high Agility, which contributes to staying hidden.  Once you get to the 30s, you just plain can't be seen by most things even when you're crouched right in front of them.
---
The Mistress of mysteries quest line gets multiple non-legendary unique items. For me personally I don't use the majority of them but I like the blade of bastet as a 50% ignore armor one handed melee weapon. all of them can be leveled up as you level up at a crafting bench as well which is nice.
---
I have them, I would just like to find more
---
1) Stealth Boy - Available mod for Power Armor chest piece (I have a suit of T-60 with it equipped).   
---
2) Medic Pump - Available mod for Power Armor Chest piece. (Definitely available for T- series, not sure about raider or excavator).
---
If you disagree with this comment, I got a bridge to sell you. 
---
Without community patches, pretty much every Bethesda game ever is buggy, and only gets more broken after major DLC hits.
---
I am almost certain the festive datamined stuff is for the December Nuclear Winter challenges, including the gingerbread table, fireplace, etc.
---
I’m working on that quest right now. I have the blade, now I’m working on getting the gun, I have no clue where to get the hallucination gas though when I go to garahaan mining co
---
Is that the best you've got? "Wah don't make fun of us for being terrible with money!" 
---
I like how you ignored the fact everyone mocks people who own crocs, tap out shirts, etc. LOL Guess you didn't have a rebuttal to that.
---
I think it makes sense as an end game quest. You have to recover various pieces from all over the game map, pay an npc a ton of caps to start assembling it, maybe throw in some tough fights here and there.
---
Once it is complete the vertibird will fly to your location, drop down, you can jump in whatever your carry weight and fly to any location on the map to be dropped off. Have it consume some expensive craftable fuel that makes waste oil and some other components a valuable item.
---
Make a landing pad CAMP item that you must place, if you run out of fuel it will appear at your landing pad automatically but you cannot fly until it is refueled.
---
Also have optional weapon loadouts you can build, like guns or missiles, and it will support you during fights. I would not have the player fight from the craft (doubt server or engine could handle it) but it will act like the grafton steel support vertibird (maybe a little better).
---
Just think of the money they could make on vertibird cosmetic skins. Make it the uktimate late game trophy for badass players.
---
If modders could do their thing in Fallout 76, it would be a completely different (and better) game.
---
Fixing bugs isn't a luxury, it's a requirement for a product your already paid for. And if you're going to thank them, at least wait for when the bugs are actually fixed and no other bugs surface. Then, MAYBE you can thank them.
---
I've had my laptop constantly crash to desktop after this patch. Desktop is fine. They did something that screws up low powered devices.  This game uses a lot if CPU so it,'s not surprising power/cooling issues are common.
---
I agree. Workshops have the potential to be something great
---
Your core point continues to ignore that we already have content in the game designed for groups of 20+ people. The SBQ and Project Paradise are absolutely large group ventures by design. 
---
The things you are trying to say would require too much work to rebalance already need to be rebalanced even if they keep the game as  it is as far as groups go. But we already have content that exceeds the limitations of group size in the game.
---
We need a way in game to get everyone under the same social umbrella. The fact that people can share perk cards should absolutely not stand in the way of correcting that. 
---
The game wouldn't lose anything of value when compared to what it gained if they disabled the feature in order to accommodate something we desperately need, which is more social tools to get more social interaction in the game.
---
How do you figure 600?
---
Thanks for the unanounced update bethesa
---
I am curious, I always feel this game needs player driven quests and gameplay to liven it up. Unfortunately I do not have a faction but I watch with great enthusiasm.
---
It is a sales technique and psychology 101 facts. Bethesda corporation sales have been using all of the same tricks employed at the general mobile gaming market, just as highlighted by Yong Yea from the insider corporate lectures by EA and mobile titles like Clash of Clans or Candy Crush.. It is a whole science to make customer to spend money by offering deals a person is unable to refuse. Bethesda have joined money making machine and thats why we all had a moment of silence..Goodbye Bethesda you will scam us no more
---
OH ya.. a hell  of a lot of people.
---
From a capitalist standpoint, would you rather make money doing things people would buy or "be nice" and do everything for free.  It's not hard to see why devs do this type of stuff.  It sure does suck for the end user but if they are billing 76 as a "game as a service" they have to keep a steady stream of income.  They cant just bank on $20 bucks here or there from people buying the game to try it out.
---
It makes the exact thing people were already doing easier. I know, I have mules and fallout 1st. J haven't touched my mules since it went live.
---
I see what you are saying but is there any way that i could pull attention from mobs so they arent attacking people who are using melee. I kinda agree either way the bonus to reviving people is less than suppressing. Good idea.
---
Just making sure that you know that you can buy the plan for the fusion generator. It's like 200 caps. Can't remember which vendor sells it though, . . .
---
That's great! Sounds like it all went down as it should have!
---
PS4 but appreciate the offer.
---
Lol. This always happens on Tuesday and Thursday around this time.
---
Should be up shortly. Usually down for less than a few hours.
---
Well, 12 months ago, I was bitching about your loot disappearing if you grabbed new loot on the way back to pick up the original death bag . . . and got killed again.  Thought that was fixed many patches/updates ago but it's still there.  12 months ago, I was bitching about be one-shotted by every griefer who came by; same thing still happening today despite my fancy power armour, lvl 149, and a fist full of worthless perk cards.  Still love my "physical media" cardboard drink coaster though . . .
---
I don't think so. My aim in 3rd person is awful.
---
Who is us? I don't spend money on that game lol. Also I'm not sure why you keep trying to bring crocs and oceanside property into this conversation, but it's utter nonsense, neither of those things are comparable to a video game. Perhaps you are still young and just feeling out how to make a proper argument. Either way, I said what I said. You just sound bitter and a little silly and stuck up. Take it or leave it I suppose, guessing my your demeanor you'll just continue to make a fool out of yourself. Either way I doubt this conversation will produce anything fruitful at this point, so I've rather lost interest in it.
---
love love love this idea
---
As an alternative, you can buy the fusion generator plan from Grahm, and I think one other vendor.  It's not overly expensive - IIRC, its about 240 caps, perhaps less with hard bargain + grape mentats.
---
I think some of the mats you need to build it are going to be more difficult to acquire at lower levels unless you find them in a player vending machine.
---
What level are you?  
---
There's bags of concrete in several different places, but some of them are in locations I would recommend you be at least L30.  
---
There's at least two concrete deposits in the Forest you can "mine."
---
This is shortened to RB1st
---
&gt;So I never lost anything and obviously never submitted a ticket but after seeing this post I checked my emails and I got the email
---
Can you show us the email? I did not receive one...
---
Tuesday and Thursday they do updates. Should be up within 2 hours.
---
No excuse for no logs when you have this many bugs
---
Oh, I completely agree.
---
I would love to see a bloatfly wielding a swing speed golf club
---
humor? get it?
---
I think all this went out the window when people realized how grindy this game is.
---
Yes they did, it exceeded their expectations in sales, which is a good thing for the future of the game.
---
Have stuff from each category and your foot traffic will increase exponentially.
---
I think 50k is reasonable, it should allow you to buy two of the most expensive item in the game (from vendor bots). I do not think the inflation can get much worse than it already is, except now have Th e time a transaction involves multiple characters.
---
**Bug** (new for me): Attacked a Scorchbeast which never turned red, thus VATS didn't work, yet it was clearly attacking me. [https://youtu.be/SFbU\_FqIvro](https://youtu.be/SFbU_FqIvro)
---
That also allows me to add strange in numbers. Thanks.
---
Oh. you mean mouse sensitivity.. not the aiming sensitivity.. ok.. I understand.. my bad.
---
It is fun. I got my game for 19.99. Happy all around.
---
I think you should be able to roleplay your idea! A million is a nice fun cap!
---
There is, you can hit your push to talk key and say thank you, or I'm sorry.
---
You were completely right. Last try I could keep my character and can change the appearance of my character at anytime now.
---
As a side note, I've played a bit more today and thankfully I'm enjoying the exploration aspect. At first sight, the map seems more interesting/varied than Fallout 4 but need to explore more.
---
Enclave mission line rewards a unique missile launcher called the Bunker Buster. Has +20% damage.
---
Bethesda had a fundamental misunderstanding of their community which carries through to this day.
---
Also they tried to hedge their position between the traditional Bethesda fan of single player offline RPG vs what they really wanted, which was team shooter survival people. The single player offline dominated the numbers, which is why everything swung so hard away from PvP.
---
I'm personally glad it worked out that way but it might have been REALLY frustrating for PvP players that was sold on something that were never really given.
---
I'm on xbox.
---
Yes you can place items on the table
---
So yeah, you have no argument against what I said, just trying for ad hom attacks with calling me young, even though I'm old enough to have retired.
---
I started out the same, actually was somewhat successful, no one ever actually tried to shoot me, but the trade interface was so broken, numerous crashes, i gave up and misses the start of the vendong machine era.
---
But early on before everyone memorized where to camp for stuff and have fully loaded mules you could do some buy and sell action.
---
You told me that you make fun of people for wearing crocs lol, who the fuck cares and what does it have to do with fallout 76 or PA skins? Make a valid argument and I might bother to refute it.
---
Wouldn't that also mean the game wouldn't also work since they're on the same servers?
---
The 2 that bother me- guns that aren't loaded when logged in and can't be reloaded until swap and swapped back. And the card swap is probably the most annoying. I'm used to it now, but you can't mouse click on the cards to swap sometimes. It's several clicks all over to get them to highlight (using the keyboard works though).
---
Why would you store the junk from 13 different characters in just one scrapbox?
---
I’ve gone through the enclave missions, I just need to launch a nuke to complete them all
---
Make sure to dive in with the mentality that this is not Fallout 4 (or Fallout 5 for that matter). It will make the gameplay more fun because you won't be disappointed while using that mentality. This is a huge factor on why many people hate the game and are not afraid to voice themselves.
---
As for the performance, make sure you don't use ultra textures, not even a GPU with 8gigs of Vram can properly run them.
---
Also, follow this simple guide as it will improve your performance substantially: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dmuf8q/graphic_and_performance_fixes_im_using_including/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
The guide disables the game's terrible VSync setting and, as a consequence, unlocks your framerate. You might want to use an FPS limiter like the one Radeon Settings has (FRTC, for AMD GPUs) or RTSS (since NVidia doesn't have a framerate limiter for some bizarre reason).
---
Some of us are still holding out. I am playing a vault-tec engineer turned BoS after discovering their fate.
---
There are two main problems that caused most people to not do this. First there is a severe lack of social tools in the game and the way servers work make it almost impossible to coordinate with groups that are interested in this kind of play.
---
Most RP is happening out of the game, in discord.  Many of the roleplayers who are playing the part are using third party text chat addons and you don't see their interactions in game.
---
Additionally Bethesda has made this kind of play harder and harder by consistently adding things that don't really support this style of play.
---
You can be an NPC, but man is it hard as hell and most people will just ignore you
---
Because I didn’t have FO1st on my 2 other accounts, and I had 3 mules on my FO1st account.
---
i asked that in the discord and everyone was afraid to answer
---
I bought the Fusion Generator plan for 190 caps from Grahm a while back. I met him again a few days and he still had the plan so that might be an easy way to get it.
---
&gt;Your core point continues to ignore that we already have content in the game designed for groups of 20+ people. The SBQ and Project Paradise are absolutely large group ventures by design.
---
Yes, because those as far as content goes is insignificant compared to the rest of the game.  Those examples are events, you can rework events rather than rework groups.   You don't need to be in a group, or part of a large group to finish them because you can just jump in. 
---
But we've already seen people ask for more group content, content that is harder.  If you start making larger groups, people will want content that needs those larger groups that are not events.  
---
&gt;The things you are trying to say would require too much work to rebalance already need to be rebalanced even if they keep the game as it is as far as groups go. But we already have content that exceeds the limitations of group size in the game.
---
I think I need you to give explicit examples of things that need to be tweaked and how it could be tweaked so that it would work in larger groups without weakening smaller groups.  
---
The only real content that exceeds that limitations is again, events, and again, you can rework events rather than rework grouping. 
---
&gt;We need a way in game to get everyone under the same social umbrella. The fact that people can share perk cards should absolutely not stand in the way of correcting that.
---
And a solution to that can be something other than adding additional people to group, which seems to be what your core point is.  They could create a guild system and you could set your mic to "guild".
---
If they rework events and added a guild system, that should solve the vast majority of the issues that people may want to have larger groups for. 
---
And it's more than sharing perk cards.  
---
&gt;The game wouldn't lose anything of value when compared to what it gained if they disabled the feature in order to accommodate something we desperately need, which is more social tools to get more social interaction in the game.
---
Improving Social Tools/Interactions != Allowing groups larger than 4
---
I quit 8 months ago...it was bugged back then lol. Damm bugthesda is pathetic 😂 tried a comeback now though
---
&gt;I doubt anyone had 1500 lbs of flux in their stash/character
---
How are you getting to 1500? I add it up to 450? 
---
&gt;Not to mention has anyone even farmed 600 worth of vault steel? 
---
How do you get to 600? I read 150?
---
I have 1st, I played during the period of the glitch, I did not lose anything,  I have not received any email, so I'm not getting the compensation.  
---
This entire thread is full of distortions and hyperbole...not that is uncommon on Reddit,  but this, and other threads, are implying that all 1st players are getting this compensation,  we're not
---
Thanks!  If private worlds allow for it, I will set up an Empire like the world has never seen.
---
Multiple other factions
---
Does your trailer park currently have a Kittyland Love Center? If not, may I open one on the premises?
---
They may not be on the same set of servers, but it's a good question. May be a regional thing.
---
They also may not be connected but is an interesting coincidence.
---
ok.  Not sure how many named non-legendaries there are...
---
Fixer, Gutter, alien blaster.... Garb of Mysteries, Eye of Ra, Voice of Set, BoBastet... then there's the Pearly Peepers...
---
Roses quest is a 1\* legendary...so is wavy willards....there's 2 other named armor pieces, but they are both 1\* legendary...  
---
Your right, there's not that many.  
---
Maybe that's why we got the ability to custom name our weapons and armor?
---
Bc they'e getting 4 stacks of 150. Read the post
---
Everything has issues when I get off work. Lol
---
Pretty much everyone makes fun of people who wear crocs, same with tap out shirts. They are literally long running meme's.
---
Is this the first time you've ventured out from under whatever rock you live under?
---
There’s supposed to be something like that on the roadmap, a prestige system
---
If they don't appear in box, make transfer and should solve the issue.
---
I'd prioritize some weight reduction perks, and replace Refractor with Fireproof.   
---
Here's my current main build (I actually have several more "swap" perks in INT, but this will give you the picture).   
---
Some quirks- You will note I don't fully max out HW Master, instead keeping 1 dot in Bandolier. (which I think saves me 80 lbs in ammo weight because I routinely have a ludicrous quantity of ammo on my person).  
---

---
Seriously, people need to have their mics enabled to get the most of this game
---
Jetpacks are hardly useable for me, because that always happens. Nothing like being hyped to craft a jetpack and being met by immediate disappointment. Good thing the marsupial mutation exists!
---
They didn’t. They are having a bug with the shop at the moment.
---
Time to join the cause brother. Vault-Tec Corporation main idea is based off player driven quests. And we will be leading the charge in the upcoming faction wars! See link
---
https://discord.gg/MH3EnVy
---
Roses quest gave you the karma syringer right? I remember getting it then I stopped playing for a couple hours and came back and it was gone from my inventory and not in my stash
---
Having character name instead of account displayed would really help too.
---
It's talks when there is an enemy nearby and also at random
---
Not good for sneaking haha, though I don't know of npcs hear it
---
Well for your sake I hope you aren't truly old enough to be retired and still speaking like an adolescent. Either way, your obsession with crocs and tap out shirts has been noted, but the connection between them and buying a PA skin has yet to be explained...
---
You use you mic and speak as your character. I know its hard, but it is what tabletop Roleplayers do all the time.
---
Well anything can be good if you really want to "fame the game.
---
The vids of people killing her with melee quick are exploiting every drug, probably the booze or nuke shine alcohol - they are using a bloodied Meat Hook which is bugged and gains full benefit from iron fists and gladiator perks, they are using a sneak attack and in maybe the stronger or that pumpkin grenade that doubles fps.
---
Similar can likely be done for ranged it really just depends on how hard you want to try. Personally I just show up when someone launches a nuke, hold the trigger on my guns for a few mins, collect loot and move on. I'm not here to break any records, although I can appreciate there are people that get off on that kinda stuff.
---
They are mocked for being stupid wastes of money, just like this 18$ skin in a 10$ game.
---
Bunker Buster is a legendary.
---
OP, are you talking about some new invulnerability glitch that involves any energy weapon, or the known glitch that involves legacy legendary explosive energy weapons?
---
Good strategy is to keep your pile near max scrip every day in case of a sale. Spend 150 on stuff, get 150 by scripping
---
Eg: I have 950, I spend 100, I have 850, I collect stuff and sell back to 1K for tmmr.
---
\- Dies just as the SBQ goes down  
---
\- Respawn (x) won't  
---
\- Still it's nice that the guns I don't use work now
---
To be fair we don't have to acknowledge those things as role-players. We can easily place limit our own characters.
---
We’ve been asking for sorry emote since beta. Hopefully they’ll make it soon.
---
This, they didn't give us the tools. Many of us still want to RP. We need the tools to do it in game.
---
That too. Good call
---
LOL you don't even know how to mock things properly. crocs and tapout shirts aren't mocked for being a waste of money, they provide the same service as any tshirt or shoe - they are mocked because they look silly and were a short lived fad... I guess they really do let anyone use the internet, I'm truly sorry in advance if you are some sort of special needs kid. I had no way to know until now..
---
That’s not a comment
---
Yeah there is no feedback. If players had emotes like other mmorpgs it would be way better than what we have
---
Really so I bought this plan for nothing?
---
So you're just leaning into being an asshole then?  Fuck everyone whose pc may be a bit dated because I WANT MY SMOKE MACHINES!
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
Creating a separate character is Not a solution, but it’s what I did to not mess with my main.
---
I carry 15 power armor chassis and do fashion shows for people.
---
You still have access to scrap box after subscription ends. You just can’t add anything to the box.
---
in previous games the dialog from the suit didn't alert enemies or damage stealth, and i want it now...just not for how much they want
---
I don't remember.  
---
All the syringers are special purpose and still have "syringer" in the name - so I don't think about them when I think "weapon"
---
I know there's VOX Syringer, but at all of 6 damage...with the mission to kill a yogi with it...nah.  You need something else to take it health down far enough before you switch to the Vox syringer for the final hits.
---
Someone hasn't ever looked at the prices for those items. Tap out shirts are 50+$ for a t-shirt. Crocs are roughly 30 to 40$ for foam slippers that you can find at the dollar store for like 2$.
---
I’d love for enemies to use more guns. A scorched or mutant wielding a Gatling plasma would be so fun to see.
---
Yes but you can't buy the PA skin for 2$ at a dollar store now can you? It's only available at once place for whatever price they decide. So it's apples and oranges now, isn't it? People buying crocs or overpriced tshirts had the option to buy the same thing for cheaper, people buying PA skins don't have that option?
---
If they do have a test beta/alpha they’ll probably find some way to make money off of it. Like only Fallout 1st Members or they get early access.
---
I really hope it can be added once the subscription ends, but if we do indeed lose complete access to depositing items post-subscription, what a tease this email will turn out to have been.
---
Rose gives the black diamond ski sword
---
While it would benefit to have anyone involved in a test server, even a 1st only test server is still a test server.
---
Thanks for the comment, and trying!
---
There is also Daisy cutter from free states (I think), and all rise from Mayor for a day.
---
I wish there were a ton more emotes in general, the perfect cosmetic to monetize, much more exciting than flat single color paint jobs! But I guess it requires more than minimal effort  so unlikely, and they’d just charge $20 for one emote anyways so probably not worth the disappointment.
---
Not really, when it is just literally the same skin they already released once with a gray scale added to it.
---
I love how you keep trying to change the subject every time I've proven your arguments wrong. 
---
What happened to crocs and tap out shirts being mocked not for being over priced garbage again? Just because there are or aren't other options doesn't mean something is stupidly overpriced. 
---
Literally why I brought up the 120+$ axe skin from APEX, that got mocked so bad they removed it. LOL
---
battlefield V has a separate firestorm  community
---
So, I received the same email but I never opened a ticket....
---
Considering FO3 and NV had no camp/settlement system... of course it would be a comical idea...
---
And Fallout 4 DID have paid for furniture through their DLC updates.
---
So did you even lose scrap or no?
---
At least you don’t think you actually lost scrap haha
---
You can find a gas canister on both floors of Camp McClintock as well I believe. Sometimes at the Darling Sister's lab as well.
---
Yup, I put the jet pack torso away for now and added emergency protocols to a second one to use. It was nice being able to reach stuff just out of the reach of the marsupial jump but I need some predictability.
---
i just hope performance will be fixed too
---
We need a "put your mic on" and "do not disturb" emotes. Anyone who offers himself or herself as a teammate should at least have the courtesy to communicate via mic, and if they are mute or not equipped with a mic, they should tell the other person of their condition.
---
What was the issue with it before? I’ve been using mine and haven’t noticed a problem
---
If you turn off team mode you are 24v1 and all of those people are in a team. Btw because of you there is also a team only with 3 people. This gamemode has no real solomode. Lol.
---
I would give you the 1000 caps if you had where to store them. You are too rich for this game. Try GTA.
---
Because that's sort of the point?  We're not a bunch of haggard survivors that have been living for generations in either a nuclear hellscape or a vault designed to try to kill us.  We're the optimistic elites released into a still bountiful land that hasn't been overrun by murderous slave traders.
---
I didn't change any subject? you've proven no arguments wrong, all you did was cement the fact that making fun of PA skins and making fun of fallout-shirts and crocs are completely different. One you had an option, the other you didnt'. Not to mention I checked both links you sent me, the tapout shirts are just a brand name for some MMA company, and they refer to when people need to literally tap on the ground to make the referee end the match. And crocs were just a tacky fad. Either of those has any relation to any PA skin armor. 
---
You've only strengthened my resolve.
---
Plus since you are doing it as a meme, then you in fact proved my point you are just doing it for your own self benefit, for your own enjoyment. 
---
Either way, you've done nothing but cement the fact that you try and mock people to feel good about yourself or for fun or memes, which was my original point. Think about why you are mocking people, and if its just for entertainment, ask yourself what kind of person you are. Seems pretty shallow.
---
The turrets aren't glowing purple are they?
---
I know it sounds like I'm smoking toilet bowl cleaner  but I have had a mythical Flatwoods monster mind control a camps turrets and almost kill me before I realized what was going on.  Was looking through a vending machine when the damned thing exploded and I realized I was being attacked.
---
Yeah it's been posted 10 times already, and big discussion are going on, use the search
---
I’m not trying be a hero, but I hate when we don’t successfully kill the queen. That’s what I want to avoid. If I launch and the wrong people show ipX she just fly’s away at the end and I’m like, damn.
---
How much vault 94 does it give you? I'd be interested in knowing what they give you
---
I would be very happy
---
If you're on ps4 I love helping low level characters in need!
---
For the challenge let's say its pick 10 flowers. You pick 5, get 10 in your inventory but only 5 register toward the challenge. Now picking 5 actually registers 10.
---
With green thumb, ammo, wood chipper Perks, the extra tended not to count to challenges.
---
Have you forgot about everyone's favorite football team? Beep beep beep beep beep beep TOUCHDOWN.
---
You've just described essentially every game trailer.  Obvious prerendered CGI trailers aside most companies don't even use the actual game engine to produce trailers even if they're supposed to be representative of actual game play and even if a company uses the actual game engine they're going to touch it up to hell and back.
---
i recently pvp'ed against 2 lvl 40s while i was lvl 60 
---
i won at first, then i took the fight to their camp and got rekt so i waved at them afterwards 
---
pvp is needed in this game, hoping for some turf wars or something
---
If you launched from the same silo on a different server you character will have a cool down that is separate from the silos themselves. I usually launch one from each and then switch characters when I hop servers.
---
Legendary parts of their bodies.
---
Yes, but if people acknowledged that they'd miss a chance to shit on Bethesda and act as if they're the only company scummy enough to do something like this.
---
Have you claimed it? Did you get anything new?
---
.... for you are crunchy...and go well with ketchup.
---
Ahhh okay that makes sense! I was worried I hadn’t been getting a bonus. That’s a frustrating bug for you guys who like to do the achievements
---
He's talking about the communication about their future plans. Updating people on the bug fix timeframe for people who didn't already know about it. It's a good ITV by that measure
---
That was a great fight
---
It's okay my friend. Wait until you hit level 100, you will eat them for dinner.
---
I had unkillable 3\* there one the other day. Just sitting there huffing and puffing on the ground. It wouldn't attack and I could only get its health down to 25% before it would instantly regenerate. I wasn't pleased.
---
But let me implant this in someone's head also:  Deathclaw Padoru.
---
Bruh read the news
---
I'm not the only one is seems
---
It usually says something when it "spots" the enemy then something else when you kill the enemy. It's all automatic.
---
Love me some but fixes
---
**Issue: "Friendly" normally hostile NPC's will attack, receive damage back and not flag as enemies.** (Ticket Submitted on 011/21/2019)
---
B.E.T.A. age issue that was fairly uncommon, thanks to a kind Redditor we now have a Video of it happening, a Scorchbeat attacking the player, but remaining "non-hostile" during the process, preventing VATS's from functioning.  
---
For any VATS based build this can be crippling.

Yikes. I have the same email. I think this is an attempt to lure people into not cancelling the second month. No offense but I don't see what's worth keeping it. I have everything I need already.
---
150 VAULT STEEL!!!! 
---
Fallout 1st is really paying off
---
Aha!  Thank you so much!
---
yeah i remember this one, old days 
---
im no game dev but i dont understand why stashed items have an impact on servers
---
Another incredibly lackluster inside the vault. As per usual they make up something that they say is what we were sad there wasn't enough of Which wasn't bugged it fixes but instead fallout 1st and lack of content issues.
---
 They have yet to say a word about their lying about the scrap boxes and they are pretending that everything is hunky Dory. 
---
That said it is nice to know that they have a confirmed what many of us suspected which is that a lot of these fixes will come in the new game. Unfortunately this also seems to signify that they are indeed shooting for sometime around February or even later in the year.
---
The black Friday sale seems incredibly stingy as is their new modus operandi so everything looks normal as usual. Also their so called event for the fans is another photo shoot which we are just absolutely sick and tired of. 
---
I give this itv a 2/10.
---
See, even your turrets know you have bad deals ;P
---
I think it’s a 6. The last few weeks have had zero information. This one has has information. A 4, minimum.
---
Nope, I like the game, but FO76 definitely doesn’t deserve it
---
Working on a Discord RP server... Yeah, it’s just not the same. If they gave us actual mechanics to do that? Yeah, I’d love to.
---
it was mentioned in todays ITV article, not in patchnotes.  did you bother to read either?
---
it was already acknowledged in today’s ITV they are working on it
---
Big time. Public worlds are horrifyingly laggy.
---
Last thing you hear "here human human human I got a treat for youuuu" *ratta tat tat tat*!!!
---
You need to run standard 35 times to get this much vault steel. You're lying to yourself if you think it isn't a convenience
---
I think that we don't have enough information yet to determine this.  If history is any indication, we might be expecting too much, but maybe they really are adding a ton of content.  So far, everything has been relatively small.  I think the Sheepsquatch stuff and Pioneer Scouts was the most substantial "content", but even then a lot of the regular players burned through them pretty quickly.  Is Wastelanders going to just add 4-5 hours of content (maybe for each faction), or are they going to fundamentally change the map (making randomly exploring the world fun again)?  The Vault raids were a flop (and Project Paradise seems ignored now).  Vending machines were awesome.  Special events have been decent.  Nuclear Winter is fun, but why is it still in Beta?  The updates have been all over the map, so who knows what's next.  
---
What I am worried about though, is that if they alter the current map, then new players will miss out on the experience of exploring a dead world.  On the other hand, if they have separate servers, they will split the players and we will never see low-level players again.  They have said that the faction companions will be limited to specific quests (instances), etc. so my gut feeling is that the new content will be cool, but after 5-10 hours it will be over and we will be right back where we are now.
---
awesome. it’s good to have a separate area from the actual 76 thread
---
I have no clue why I got this email.

&gt;How do you get to 600? I read 150?
---
150 per pack, above the list it says each person gets 4 packs of all the contents
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dzbywz/found_the_exact_amount_of_the_lost_scrap_yall_be/ in case you were wondering..
---
I will for sure let you know if it returns - next time with a video.
---
Thanks for your time! Sorry there wasn't more to report here.
---
Noooo!!!   I want to own the future.
---
No.
---
There's a meteor sword you get from doing breach and clears.
---
i think you responded to the wrong person? 
---
either way its way more runs than that, since its 150 v.steel x 4 packs (600)  math wise they get just shy of 2 months worth of novice, standard, and expert rewards
---
Ok thx for the info!
---
Buy it anyway and see what happens.
---
Is it special in any way?
---
Oh. I've never actually seen that.
---
Yeah you can carry a group with a godly bloodied heavy weapon &amp; build. Gatling lasers are popular because when they are primed they are so God damn ammo efficient.
---
After the recent buff to prime ammo crafting, if you equip ammosmith you get 3 ultracite fusion cores per craft. 6 if super duper procs. That's 3000-6000 shots (with power user equipped) and more than enough ammo to last a whole fight probably. For a total cost of 1 fusion core and 1 violet flux.
---
Uhh... except they are?  When you're playing NW you're not an original occupant of the vault, those were all of the people whose holotapes and logs you can find around the vault.  Before NW launched they added some holotapes to Adventure which were supposed to provide some initial lore and lead you to Vault 51, where our Adventure players then get roped into the testing.  From that point on you'd have to rationalize that the actual testing is taking place in VR or something since... everything.
---
Yup, my bad, I didn't catch the stack part, just looked at the numbers
---
You take that logic right out of here!
---
Leaves no room for knee jerk complaining posts
---
/s
---
No i read it but i must've miss read the article. Thanks for being a cool dood about it though.
---
Nope you can have a santa hat and pay 3000 atoms for it.
---
Yup, my bad, I didn't catch the stack part, just looked at the numbers, thanks for clarifying
---
I am enjoying it on xbox.  Play strictly pacifist at the moment.  Learned the hard way of claiming a workshop.  However, it is cool to help another with an event or in a tough situation though.  Played to level 46 with one character then started a 2nd which is level 63.  I saw a level 506 today.  Wish the stash was larger.
---
Indeed someone put it there
---
Them pushing back the release a few months does give me a glimmer of hope.
---
Thanks for the PSA. By and large, I have met some very decent and generous players in the game. They have given me ammo, weapons and armor. Some have even repaired or modded my weapons. Virtually all the friends I have met are much higher than me in  gamer level. They have warned me about scammers and griefers in the game.  I guess everyone should beware when they are low power level, or young (under 18). A scammer's favorite victim is a noob.
---
What does the alien blaster do? I found one but it’s just tickling damage so I scrapped it.
---
You're good, dont mean to sound snarky just distraught about the whole situation.
---
For free, I assume?
---
For fuck sake... how many times does it need to be explained that these posts are likely put together by some person in their marketing/PR department?  The actual bugs are being addressed by the people that are actually programming the game, stop freaking out because some intern forced to write these blog posts every week copied something wrong from the notes they were handed.
---
I will meet you at 3. The information was already widely assumed and not really news.
---
Privileges of being a first class citizen instead of a filthy peasant.
---
They won’t fix the 1st melee hit glitch , I doubt this will ever happen unfortunately 🦉
---
Sorry. Meant to reply up the tree. Yeah, it's unacceptable and insane.  This can't have been an oversight
---
And not exclusively on the atom shop for atoms.
---
nope, you gotta pay up to play up
---
it’s compensation to the people who lost their junk from the scrap box deleting it. i didn’t have the issue, got no email, so i’m not getting it
---
*600
---
If duping will STILL be a thing when wastelanders launch - it's dead on arrival.
---
Why would you even post this? You know they go through this sub looking for ideas, and you just gave them a golden one.
---
I feel exactly the same way, this is absurd
---
I did the same thing, but I'd just crafted a bunch of serums so had less flux than I'd normally have.
---
I’d really like a LOL emote, like literally rolling on the floor laughing. I’ve run into many hilarious scenarios but couldn’t express myself properly 🤮
---
its only for people who lost all of their scrap from a scrapbox bug
---
Look at it like this: most people do not do the raids, so will not use the vault steel. This means more people will want to do them for the plans. At the very least, it could cause groups to form easier for you, no more herding cats
---
No they are red names and health bars. 
---
I now want them to turn purple because that does sound bad ass.
---
Hey Bethesda, can you send this Flatwoods Monster after me once this bug gets fixed?
---
Are duplicate keys/holos and whatnot the cause of severe inventory and vendor lag? Because if they are... please let me get rid of them. I stopped picking that stuff up eventually but I can't clean up my inventory now.
---
On characters that don't have a shit-ton of keys/holo duplicates the pipboy and vendors aren't a fraction as slow. If letting me get rid of the ones I don't need would improve my inventory/vendor experience please let me do it.
---
WS, Morgantown, and sometimes I'll try a random location like Charleston (not as good as the other 2).
---
I like big butts and I can not lie
---
You other brothers can't deny
---
Fuck this game this is now p2w
---
Like the new standby screens.  Saw the plane in the new load screen crashed near the space station.
---
Sure mate ty
---
I actually hoarded vault steel hoping they'd patch it to allow the Thorn and Solar armors to have the Unyielding modifier. Thank God I specifically didn't put that in the stash, so I'll have a little under 800 after I get the bonus junk.
---
So I got the game at Launch but was so into FO4 that I just couldn't get into 76 at all.  I gave up after maybe a month.  I think I started a new game of FO4 and then RDR2 came along.
---
When Waste landers was announced I had not been playing anything for some time.  76 never really appealed to me as I am not really into the whole online aspect.  Wastelanders seems like a step back towards the FO I know and love.  SO I started playing again because I didn't want to be a low level when that came out.  I have been playing for a while now.  Got up to lvl 75 or so.  The addition of FO1st for me at least has been great.  Honestly if it would have been an option to pay for private servers right off the bat I would have probably been playing this whole time.  I get why people hate it but, for me its the way I like playing Fall Out.  Especially 76. It really feels like me vs the world.
---
entire game should have been in the atomic shop, free to play, unlock 30 mins of play with 1000 atoms hahahah
---
This happened on Wednesday night for me. My teammate could reach the Atomic Shop, but I couldn't. I have several thousand atoms, some that were rewards for in-game play, and some that were purchased with real money. This game is full of frustrating experiences, and I think the developers suffer from radiation damage in the brain.
---
I was thinking a fat ghoul in a Santa clause outfit
---
I login from time to time. 76 is kinda like an abusive spouse, whom you keep coming back to each time they say they'll change.
---
Maybe that's the case. I heard it happened with characters who had large amounts of junk and I know I'd brought 2 mules entire junk collections over to my main. For me though it was still mostly mundane junk. It may be fewer people getting this than I'm thinking and for all I know I may be in the minority for having a large amount of junk bot only a hundred flux combined excluding yellowcake that I farm because its serums sell pretty well.
---
it's hard to RP with character names like: swagdaddy6969001 or sub3rguy1028 or b3ck1\_dafalloutgurl.
---
if there was a switch that let us show our character name or gamer tag...
---
Actually, people who didn't submit a ticket are getting them, and I guarantee nobody who lost their junk had 600 vault steel. Period.
---
150 vault steel?!? That's insane.  Enough to make both non pa armor sets or just a bit shy of an entire full set of strangler pa.
---
i agree with specifically the v.steel, i dont personally mind the rest of the compensation, but the vault steel is bullshit.
---
&gt;it completely negates the hard work of everybody who didn't subscribe and win the 'we think you were bugged' lottery
---
this is what pisses me off.  i have ran them almost daily since vault release and have only earned ~400 in total. (2 novice, 4 standard, 6 expert) i spent hundreds of hours between the runs, and prep/recovery time just for vaults.  and now people who may of never touched it get 600, aka 2 months worth of grind?
---
&gt;IS ANYBODY RUNNING MELTDOWN IN EXPERT?
---
my groups normally do everything but washout expert, fuck washout expert lol.
---
The hardest part of doing the vault raids is getting people together....as you stated.  
---
   I dont even bother anymore. Im admittedly not that great at it, but i can survive, and help in a team. But its a pita figuring that out. Most of the people i knew who were doing it regularly are done now
---
We could use shotguns again!! Lol
---
Nice, works well as my new wallpaper.
---
Bethesda:  No refunds.
---
my mate destroyed his be lazer and has quit the game
---
https://1drv.ms/u/s!As0DyJ23oBRcv7Ikicg2sHkzmSTT1w?e=3iEUrP
---
Actually, I completed Outer Worlds in hard mode, and felt I needed a Fallout-like fix. I bypassed FO76 in its first 11 months, due to reviews and clamor about buggy software. Thus, I never left the game, but just delayed starting it. The number of remaining players in the game have been superhelpful. The feel of the game, however, is not well structured. Very non-linear. Constantly dealing with the survival aspect makes the game different from most other shooter rpg games. Is this one of the things that attracts people? A psychologist might say the game appeals to packrats.
---
I was unaware of that,it wouldn’t let me for whatever reason,but awesome nonetheless
---
Since we're talking multiplying here, it would be 1/16 times the mechanics to bring it down to a 1x, for a 1:1 balance.
---
16×-16 makes it -256, aka truly broken.
---
thank you for uploading the SS
---
I'm in a BoS chapter discord server I joined last month. I joined the ranks of the field scribes a few weeks ago.
---
OMG I FIGURED IT OUT. Its actually an xbox setting. Its under chat mixer in the audio settings. Change mute all other sounds to do nothing
---
Thanks for the appreciation
---
Tell Beth you'll pay for them.
---
A week? Oh you sweet summer child. I grinded it off an on for 2 months. Turning in 6 or 7 from trips back and forth to the bunker on several occasions. I'd estimate I've easily turned in north of 200. I think I have 3 of them. 
---
Tons of field scribe outfits, so I've got that going for me.
---
well i guess the 600 vault steel was true, thanks for the giant middle finger bethesda
---
You're not compensated with 600!!! That's 60 rolls of the dice on thorn or solar. Nobody had that much. They need to change the values to 15 vault steel at most, 10% of the current seems fair. I genuinely hope they just put a zero somewhere
---
Just curious, did you lose any junk from the scrapbox or get an email?
---
Herbavore? Adrenal reaction?
---
Yes I lost my scrap to the box and created a ticket but never heard a response. I haven't received an email either. Just very suprising lol
---
Gonna give you a list of things you missed. This is a copy paste message and may not be applicable to the questions asked. Reply and I'll go into detail on things if you want
---
March is when they actually started improving the game, from Nov-Feb it was only bug fixes and a boring world. Not listing things in any order, you missed:
---
three weeklong holiday events with camp and cosmetic rewards (minor addition)
---
alcohol crafting with daily quests (minor addition) 
---
a camera for taking quicker pictures (minor addition)
---
New faction and questline with backpack reward (large addition)
---
Sheepsquatch questline with unique weapon reward and side quests, two repeatable events (major addition)
---
Small dungeon with quest (small addition)
---
Large dungeon with repeatable event (large addition)
---
Player Vending Machines (small addition)
---
Nuclear Winter game mode with 51 other players in a battle Royale scenario with special cosmetic rewards (major addition)
---
Special vendor that gives random Legendaries in exchange for other Legendaries (small addition)
---
Vault Raid which gives guaranteed armor rewards with unique set bonuses (major addition)
---
Display cases for your camp which allows you to place items so visitors can view them (minor addition)
---
Basically I put either small, large, or major for what these updates added to the game. However, that's only in terms of content. For example I would say player vending and the legendary vendor were bigger adds than say vault raids or the Arktos Pharma dungeon. Still a buggy game though, but that's what Bethesda is. Wastelanders will be like a chapter 2 with a supposedly different feel but it's coming out early next year
---
Don't worry they will soon turn up as micro transactions.
---
I don't think I've ever seen anyone in raid armor either on Ps4 Eastern server.
---
I just know that anyone who's ever expected game accuracy from a Sid Myers civilization trailer will be sorely disappointed.
---
Are you using stealth? Sneak attacks are how you kill her fast.
---
I will get those 2 next then. Do you know 2 more that players us often? I am still a bit new to the serum franchise lol.
---
How is that relevant to his observation that 30k is not enough?
---
Twisted muscles and bird bones I think are also popular. Someone else may he better to answer
---
Wow, the paid downvote brigade is at full power. I'm pretty chill and don't join the mob on either side of this bullshit but shit, the amount of junk being given as compensation for those who did and did not lose their stuff is absurd... like what, at most people would've lost like 40 vault steel?
---
Good tip. I ran the utility after pulling the diagnostic report. Too soon to tell if it helps. Hope so but I would still like to file a bug report.
---
This is still the bare minimum in terms of communication, though the silver lining is that they’re at least somewhat addressing the community concerns.
---
Check your email. It'll have info
---
Isn't Twisted Muscle for a melee class?
---
Ah cool mate, might reinstall over xmas
---
I cant believe it. I seriously cant believe they are handing out that many mats when i have had tickets with video evidence of losing items and i got nothing returned. This is absolutely a middle finger to some players and im now left with the only option of canceling my subscription and uninstalling this game
---
To bad the you crash right before getting the final hit on said boss.
---
Wow. I always keep my scrip bank high so when these "sale events" drop, i have scrip to use.
---
while you are not getting the items, those that are, many of which never touched the raid, are getting a 2 month grind worth of freebies.  where at most they would of lost 150-200 if they didnt craft anything since vault launch
---
The vault steel is the only thing I have an issue is, thats way too much to just give out.
---
Unless theyve patched the strangler PA exploit, expect to see loads of sets for sale soon
---
I took the screenshot and then clicked it. It then proceeded to crash lol
---
I think they did a whole lot more than returning your scrap.
---
Talons for unarmed characters maybe?
---
they have not patched it yet
---
Been playing almost every day since release. I almost quit, then they added vending machines. It really brought some life to the game because instead of the map being bare and lifeless, suddenly you had all these cool camp builds to pop into and it didn't feel as stifling as before
---
Yes! I love the sons of dane jukebox. And having a chance to drop in one violent night would be perfect!
---
Holy shit, I don't think I've ever had that much scrap in my life.
---
I'm curious as to whether this is only going to 1 character per account, or every character with a stash box? If the latter, I'll have enough junk to rebuild the entire east coast. 😂
---
&gt; IS ANYBODY RUNNING MELTDOWN IN EXPERT?
---
^^Raises ^^hand
---
However sites like ebay dont seem to have an issue with it.
---
Going to be a lot more saltiness about people crashing due to 10 people running round with strangler
---
Is there a high volumn of unarmed players?
---
I was just going to comment on that little shed in the cemetery.  I still snag bags from there once in awhile (lvl 210)
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/373399/silo-mainframe-explosive-weapons-don-t-work/29
---
"Hi, after discussing this thread with the devs today, mainframe cores not being damaged by explosive weapons is definitely a bug and not any sort of intentional change. We're looking into a fix!"
---
&gt;However sites like ebay dont seem to have an issue with it
---
yup thats true, the ebay problem is mostly it is hard to catch the account of the person doing it, so ebay has trouble stopping the sales
---
Truly a man amongst men.
---
Are you on ps4?
---
But how would they be able to implement mods when some people have them and some people don't? How would a multiplayer game work when everyone on the server has varying mods? I'm not being a smartass, I truly don't know.
---
One person might have a massive patch mod, and another player doesn't. One person might have a reskinned enemies mod, and another player doesn't, etc. How would that work?
---
That’s correct
---
Yeah, I have zero guilt about my box. Nor would I be upset if everyone got one.
---
eagle eyes, bird bones, adrenal reaction and egg head. I would get on a wiki and make sure you're not getting too many that use one type of Flux, though. I spread out my picks a little so I could make some to sell to Vendor bots for quick/easy caps.
---
Sweet!
---
Looks like Bugthesda developers really don't know what they do or how raids works. Insane amount of steel
---
i played until lvl 30 since launch, all servers just seemed dead 
---
decided to play again 2 months ago, i liked the vendors, started selling noob items, built different kinds of camps, events are ok
---
now im just trying to do main quests and waiting for wastelanders 
---
they cannot mess it up 
---
but what bugs me the most: performance issues since launch, optimise it pls
---
I’ve been playing FO76 since around January (‘bout 2 months after release) and am only level 133 as of today! Thank you for the xp advice 😀👍
---
bandolier
---
A step in the right direction.
---
On the other hand, people with the plans who have given up on collecting steel to build the pa don't have to play for the armour since they paid for something. It's almost like there should be a term for that.
---
I would rather have a bicycle.  Definitely not as cool as an airship but I think it fits with the lore.  All it would really need to do is go just a tad bit faster than the speed demon mutation.  It would be fun riding the roads of Appalachia.  You could find different paint jobs and maybe different designs.  They really wouldn't even need to be upgrade-able or anything, just something players can find and collect. It would definitely something people would create their own fun with in the game.
---
That's absolutely fucked. 75 fluxes but 150 steels. Insane
---
Yes ! Agreed !
---
Came here to say this! They want us to role play and everything but that only works so much if it's completely imagination and nothing to encourage it!
---
this is the shitest idea ive heard in a long time i didnt lose any scrap and i dont think anyone other than the people who lost theirs should get one period
---
Really doubt if people have the plans they would give up on the steel, that's ridiculous to me. I mean the regular armor sure because it's ridiculously RNG based but the Power Armor no fucking way, they would be grinding that steel out. People quit because they don't have the plans, not because they don't have the steel
---
The trouble with the glitches is they get patched. Far as I know, the really effective ones were early in the game’s history; either BETA or the first couple months of the post-release. Every time I learned about one, it was already patched by then.. ☹️
---
Stripper ghouls, and maybe a fisto for them damn robot fetishists
---
I second this. Altho i have learned to optimize location with the current budget and managed to make a good looking city, a little bit more budget will help adding those finishing touches to it.
---
As well that there is no incentive right now for me to buy atom shop camp objects as i can even place them anyway.
---
right? all that time i put into raids feels extremely wasted now, especially now that people who blatantly said they hated and refused to run raids, got as much or more steel than people who actually ran them.
---
I'm literally the only person in two of my raid groups going for the stangler heart because nobody wants to grind the steel. These are people with plans
---
Yeah I'm on PS4. I've been running with the same group for almost 2 months now and we've been grinding each raid 3 times a day especially since Private Worlds came out.
---
Meltdown has actually grown on me once I wrapped my head around its mechanics. I admit it is still more tedious than the other raids.
---
I never knew you could dmg the cores by shooting...I always just clicked on them...
---
No thanks. I prefer my secured limited storage over the "unlimited" storage that can delete everything
---
I would point out that the melee issue you speak of, missing 2/3 of your hits, has been an issue for a while.
---
I'm always using my spiked fire axe and I noticed about two months ago, trying to hit a target has been incredibly annoying.  Same with the lack of actual damage being done.  I went so far as to turn on the HP marker every time you hit something so that I can see if I actually did any damage.
---
I was gonna say REALLY???!, but you said "literally", so I guess you're telling the truth
---
I agree that is what should have originally happened but here we are and now it is about damage control, and they have just ridiculously created a bullshit aristocracy.
---
For the sake of the future of this game, this is the only choice that is not a lunatic one, and you'll appreciate it once you think about it a littlem
---
Can you please add me on psn? I'm usually the senior in the raid and I'd love to run with people who know what they're doing so I can get the challenge completed. Could only get two guys to run yesterday and when one bluescreened he turned off the game. Be nice to play with some higher levels
---
Stop talking crazy.  Next thing you’ll be saying we should lay off the Jet.
---
The cores not breaking due to explosions is a bug.  But the number of robots can vary quite a bit and always has.  I would say that of the silos I've run since the patch, I've consistently had an above average number of them, suggesting they may have fixed the inconsistecy in some way.
---
250 damage resist when aiming is a but fix.
---
Yeah, in any online survival game the other players should always be the biggest threat as traditionally they always have been, think dayz for instance, after a little while playing you realise you can all but ignore the zombies as if they werent even in the game, the biggest hinderence they were was because they gave away where you were to other players
---
Scrip. Also not the right sub for that.
---
IDK why Bethesda puts so many restrictions on things. You cant drop that item, you cant build there, you cant place it there, it needs support, you cant remove that because other parts would be inaccesable etc. Who cares!!!!!!!!! Let us do whatever we want, place wherever we want. Maybe i wanna have totally inaccessable whole floor between 1st and 3rd floor!?  
---
Its a game where people come to have fun. Ok one might say "but atom skins etc", then just remove the skin, and place the item in the paper bag again...  
---
Why do they think so hard?
---
I've learned to optimize aswell as my base looks bigger and better than it should but due to the issues with budgeting and it glitching and changing sometimes it's just impossible to make things look nice!
---
Also same here, if I had more space I'd buy a lot more Atom Shop Items, I have the money but I just don't see the point currently.
---
No.  "Superior" means it's the best at whatever it refers to.  There is only one superior.
---
600. I just got mine
---
I could help you out a bit.
---
I did have 1 work mate who was really hoping for a more "rust like" experience, he ended up refunding his pre order after seeing the greenbriar footage and realising that the leak that this was a rust clone was entirely wrong and PvP was almost non existent
---
A set of jars on a rope would be really cool... raw flux of different types as ingredients for different color light strings.
---
Guess "Scrap this at a Scrap Box" name wasn't descriptive enough.
---
You can’t drop it... but you can sure as hell destroy it 😂😂😂
---
Oh man the glitches.... inhave one foundation that is out of place that i cant delete, that could have gave me enough budget to fill up one of my displays
---
I fought an 80th level 3\* the other day, it dropped a 1\* lead pipe :D
---
Not a paying customer and I didn't lose anything, so I'm not expecting anything here. The one upside to 1st happening was that players with unlimited scrap storage were willing to buy my excess junk as long as priced reasonably. Any players that got this pile of freebies certainly will not be in the market to buy any for a long long time, which will suck depending on how many get it.
---
I would not complain about getting a bunch of junk for free if they gave it to everyone. That is until I go to store it and realize my stash box is full to the brim and I am overburdened by several thousand pounds of junk. I don't know how they could possibly even gift that much junk to people with the normal stash box (subject to the old technical limitations issue).
---
But it’s not laziness, it’s a core aspect of that separate gamemode. You need to get a balance between NW and adventure, or have a new character. I didn’t answer my own question. The entire point of the gamemode is that you stumble across a vault and want to become the overseer. This was a design element that I haven’t seen other games do and I respect them for making it. Now I’m going to assume it is your character (because it is) and explain why you shouldn’t separate the points and why it’s probably the most lore friendly part of NW.
---
In NW you’re meant to have stumbled across this new vault. You’re provided a chance to become the overseer of said vault and then you get stuck inside, forced to kill your other vault dwellers for dominance. Now, if that’s true, does it make more sense for your rifle character to specialize on rifles, or some other completely random weapon that they’ve never seen/used before? They should stick with the weapon they’ve used for the year or so they’ve been out of the vault, obviously. Now that that’s been established, it’s pretty obvious that if you’re a food build or likewise, you’ll probably suck in an engagement between people and not whatever you’re specialized for. It’s common sense.
---
Wastelanders will need to be near enough a hard relaunch to make it worth it but even then, not sure I want to stick around given Bethesdas handling up until this point both in terms of financial development and game development.
---
Fair enough
---
I've had that before.. I had to replace my whole camp due to it and it sucked.
---
Better safe than sorry. You get 1500 pounds of flux and it'd be a shame to have to lose some.
---
Wow yeah so am I screwed?
---
 Its not the right sub,but don’t scrap it...
---
Was readin just yesterday,a post on here somewhere I can’t find,about someone lookin for one.
---
I doubt you’ll get stoopit caps for it,but I keep one,same effects if I’m not mistaken,just for the mayors quest,&amp; the novelty.
---
I know I’m not the only one,since I did read that somewhere on one of these 76 Reddit’s.
---
If I can find the post I’ll edit &amp; link
---
Nothing special. It's just unique with a scavenger hunt sort of mission so I thought I'd mention it.
---
Most of the scrap isn't that important, it's the flux and vault steel which need to be given to everyone. I'm so unbelievably disappointed about this
---
Actually, I'd put it up for a couple hundred.  For anyone who does the Buried with Honor quest, you know how annoying it can be to find a shovel when you need one, and how heavy they are.
---
Are you on ps4? My psn is dtb7591 if you're interested in running raids together?
---
I've done the vault raid more than almost anyone I know and have obtained around low 500s in steel.  It is insane to just give more than that to random players.
---
Yup done had to done it in the past but this time i noticed after i finished my city build and i aint deleting it becouse of a bloody foundation xD
---
Are you on ps4? My psn is dtb7591 if you're interested in running raids together
---
only for the few people that actually lost their junk and wrote tickets. in my discord there are around 10 people with 1st. i was the only one loosing his scrap. i am the only one now getting the free scrap.
---
dont feed the trolls that always sneak out of their little holes to put a bit more oil in the fire. ring of fire.. ring of fire. i fell into a burning ring of fire.. burn burn burn. the ring of fire.
---
Nah
---
Yes, it's been reported on and commented on by BGS already.
---
Supposedly is bugged at the moment unless it got fixed . they broke it a few patches back
---
unfortunately im an xb1 user, if they ever added crossplay id be down though
---
Im talking about the trailers
---
Today I just saw a missile turret shooting a scrap protectron from its own camp XD. Captured it but cant upload it rn. It was hilarious.   
---
I also found out that if a missile is not hostile to you, you dont get damage from it even if you are in the blast zone. Additionally, if you stand close inbetween the target and the turret, they will stop shooting until you get out of the way!
---
Okay good.. I came across it last night and was confirmed by a few friends today
---
Noticed the Melee issue is significantly worse this patch, it's frustrating
---
That's insane
---
Yeah, wait what do you play on, I'd be interested in seeing your city if you don't mind? Lol
---
People that didn't submit a ticket are also receiving the email so...
---
I actually put in a ticket and i already got my scrap, it was 10k of every minor peice of scrape and 600 of ulracite and vault steel, and 300 of every flux. Before I lost all my scrap I had zero vault steel lol
---
The trailers aren't really good at depicting the true atmosphere
---
The way ArmA does it. Man, what an amazing game.
---
Im on xbox and my gt is DARKDANI, but i just had to leave the house
---
same here
---
Uovoted, because I feel like this is the only forum we have to communicate.
---
Dang, I'm on PC ;D But same here though, Errands can't run themselves!
---
Yes
---
They must have upped the spawn ratio, cause they were rare but now I've seen a few in the last week.
---
or flatwoods monster
---
Jaja yup

trolls...
---
a few days ago i asked if bethesda maybe forget us with the lost scrap and if anyone heard anything. at least 3 people answered that it was fixed and people already got their stuff back. this sub is full of trolls sadly. and putting oil in the fire in times like these is there s.p.e.c.i.a.l.
---
That is a crazy amount, I guess they didn't advertise this feature in Fallout 1st.
---
wait so is it real if you just got the “we’re sorry package”?
---
Put it in Scrapbox, give it out free.
---
We actually offer Raid carries for a modest caps/5.56 fee on the "m @ r k e t" subreddit that shall not be named. I think we're booked this week but it wouldn't hurt to ask our team leader who's organizing all of that. If you search for "raid carries" in that aforementioned subreddit you should find the post.
---
I'll add you to PSN tonight when I get on.
---
That's, kind of bullshit. I'm a subscriber too, but didn't win the "scrap lottery", I guess.
---
Compensation does not have to be equal to the amount lost.  Compensation can, and often does,  include additional bonuses as a way to say "we're sorry we fucked up".  
---
One person you replied to said they had earned 400, the other person who replied to me guessed most would have 150 - 200.  So is it more than they could have had - yes but to lose your shit over it is crazy.   They probably gave out so much vault steel over the other materials due to it not being tradable. It's a safe compensation since it can't go anywhere else, unlike things like fluxes. 
---
Again, this only impacted the players who lost scrap to the bug, which is only the FO1st subscribers, a fraction of a fraction of the player base.  If they never did raids, they can't even do anything with it anyways.  Now they HAVE to do raids to even try. 
---
In any case you can't say it's P2W.  It wasn't an intended design.  You can say it's overcompensation, that's fine, but it's not P2W since the purchase wasn't for the scrap...quite the opposite the purchase was for a safe place to put it that was bugged.
---
Exactly my point Fallout 76 is advertisd as a funny apocalyptic game even though the true tone is pretty dark I hope they use more tones like this going forward the only good trailer that has anything close to this was the Wastelanders trailers which is my favorite
---
Yes is the 100% confirmed answer
---
Yeah if you didn't scrap at the scrap box
---
I thought the same thing at first but I swear the longer I play the more bugs I find and if you say anything on here you just get downvoted into oblivion which is stupid. I like this game alot, I buy games all the time and still all I play are FO76 and now Fallen Order. I even bought F1st. 
---
But the Public servers are ridiculous to play on. Pharma farma will take so long to register i just walk away and then all of a sudden "ding"... Sometimes the game will lag so bad that i will be frozen in frame and then the next frame im taking like 6 seconds of delayed damage. 
---
And I don't even see server stability on their list of concerns. 
---
So i have stuck to private worlds and am having alotta fun.
---
WAIT PUT ON PACK RAT RANK 3 IT MAY SAVE YOU
---
stop crying or maybe go out for a cold walk to calm down.
---
I don't know how accepted mod use is on the subreddit, but I use the [Save Everything mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/148?tab=description). Anything favourited can't be accidentally scrapped or sold. Saved my stuff many times.
---
Wait, is the v.steel just being added to scrap boxes? How do you know if you got some back?
---
Man, that is a gnarly Yao Guai!
---
Damn! Well I put in a support ticket and hopefully they correct it.
---
They don't have space for the amounts they gave away
---
I can't handle another B.E.T.A!
---
Put on packrat
---
So sick right now that I never put a ticket in! I lost all of my scrap but didn’t complain, just took it in my stride, now I’ve lost out :-( not happy!
---
Just the other day I beat 3 \*\*\* near Site Beta. They only got 1 kill on me, or rather their goons did.  I can handle the SB's just fine, it's the scorched they summon while I'm focusing on them that give me fits.
---
Still, I remember running in terror from them, then seeing if I could kill one and dumping half a ton of ammo on them, and now I amuse myself by going between fissure sites looking for them since I can usually kill one within a single clip, and sometimes only 3 shots.
---
It's a fun climb.
---
I came back because I was planning to come back before fallout first anyway. I have not seen the full world yet after a disaapointing early couple of months in the game (I felt the BETA was less buggy than release at times).
---
Fallout First irritated me, but I Came back anyway and after a little while I bought the subscription so I can play on a private world.
---
Yeah would be nice to have a few guards in Enclave gear for my camp, or raiders on my other character.
---
Hell I'd happily take the free scrapbox even if it didn't include the free junk. I would have more of the common stuff than that anyway within a few days or weeks at most.
---
Yeah, or at least a motorcycle. But it would just be a fun thing to actually use air travel, and the thing is, there is much harder terrain and harder to navigate with a bike/and or motorcycle.
---
the time i had all the plans for the power armor i was able to craft 4 pieces.
---
people either already have the powerarmor or will have farmed most of the steel at the point they have all the plans.
---
It just works - Todd Howard
---
COMPANIONS ARE COMING?
---
Its lvl25 with increased dmg or something.
---
&gt;People quit because they don't have the plans, not because they don't have the steel
---
in my experience it is very much the opposite  you should have all the plans prior to 140 steel (of 162 needed), my groups (about 18 ppl total) averaged all plans at about the 120-130 mark.  the plans are a 100% drop rate pre 1 set slearned, 66% pre 2, and 33% for the last.
---
The nailer I think counts as a 1* though.
---
you should write a ticket now. maybe they are able to see some logs or something like that.
---
Do you already have the camera?
---
Yes i have the camera.
---
Intention is seperate from the result
---
There should be a tape, some notes &amp; a broken camera. That is the quest where you get a working camera for all the challenges.
---
The healing shotgun is bad, but nothing drives me crazier than wheels swapping and being unable to emote or choose items.
---
this quest is for the camera if you already have that you are done
---
 Grey market sellers aren't encouraged here.
---
Idk maybe a text chat would be good.... far too often I come across people who dont have mics and the emotes provided are not adequate for our needs.
---
No it doesn't plus blueprint don't work on conduits a wires and also any lights that are on walls including light up signs you always will get the floating items error
---
that wallpaper/power thing is definately annoying. it took me ages to realise what was happening and why I was losing power! I always settle on wallpapers before i power up the camp now so i dont have to bother re doing it again later.  they dont even need to make a bigger budget, just reduce the cost of certain items slightly like walls/floors and especially roofs! that would make the world of difference! in saying that I do seem to be able to work with the current budget and make nice camps within the current limitations, its all about planning haha. I rebuild basically every couple of days.. its basically all i do in this game anymore lol
---
Lol I just did and it went from 11k carrybweight to 3.5k.
---
So if I can get it down to under 1k I should be good to go?
---
Oh word. Thanks. Does the quest go away? I did what the note said a while back and completed it but the quest still sits in my misc quest area.
---
That's what it's for so if you already did that unmarked quest for the camera then it's over. That was only added for people having trouble finding the tourist. It was such a hassle before, but they shouldn't have shown it for everyone
---
Yeah i noticed a huge difference with the perk attached
---
1500 is what you're shooting for. Put on all the carry perks you can oh my god. Be the food build we know you can be
---
Mainframe cores are maybe the most annoying and laggy section of the game, and one of the reason I don't launch more nukes. 
---
And somehow, they managed to make it worse.
---
What market
---
Ah, never thought of that, thanks man, I’ll give it a go now, really wished I’d done it :-(
---
If you have the power armor plans I feel like you would keep doing them until you crafted a set
---
Yup. they've given out the free junk as of this moment. 600 vault steel will be nice whenever they fix Thorn and Solar armor, I guess.
---
Don't be salty, shill.
---
Yup, just got 1500 flux and 600 vault steel.
---
My man, I am so sorry. Decide which flux is least valuable to you and take the weight out of that one.
---
This is a great idea but maybe we could start with the enemy dropping the normal weapon its using.... get hit by a super sledge, kill him loot his body, gets a spear.
---
I would love to see Graham as Grinch and Chally as Max with the fake little sewn on antlers
---
Fallout 1st World Problems!
---
Hey thanks! I would but im on Xbox....
---
Yeah I had that then was surprised on 1st most of those go away the main issue I have is none of my so called mates have f076 it's very niche and having played all of them the world gets lonely and all I do is roam and pick up scrap. I really want the NPC to be added as it just adds another dimension to the game. Despite the negativity you will find a community on 1st  and as for the class divide well I have the ranger armour and unlimited stash box
---
Sweet there is an exploit associated with this bug? Does this mean it can be upgraded to expedited status and be fixed by next week?
---
At least the peasants don't need handouts to keep playing, lol
---
All good. Add somebody else said, maybe when we get crossplay
---
I had that a while ago, I scrapped the turret and replaced it and they went back to normal.
---
There are like 15 different bos chapter discord. Not one of them actually RPs in game to my knowledge.
---
so the 600 is real..... holy fucking shit i am pissed, that’s 4 pa sets, i’ve grinded out 3 pa sets and then fallout first people just get 4 without doing anything.
---
I never lost any scrap or put a ticket in.  I was still given this stuff.
---
Screenshot while getting ready to scrap it all:  https://i.imgur.com/16mAbV3.png
---
Same, it really is a gimped experience as soon as you pull it out of the game.
---
It isn't a comment you like, but it absolutely is a comment
---
There is somewhere a hierarchy list of labels.
---
Most of the people who got it probably won't be able to run the vault enough to unlock all the plans, but I agree.
---
yes im the one who is salty here :D im relaxing on my throne made of 600 vault steel.
---
Groovy. I'm not exactly looking for a carry, more just somebody who I can run with that reliably knows what they're doing to cut down on the micromanagement. Happy to throw a fee though. Cheers: I'll be on later :)
---
Thanks for the battle mate! 
---
Although I'm still finding out which weapons work best with Strangler.
---
I'd say so. In my eyes it's quite common for a bloodied build.
---
You can be comfortable with it, but it's still wrong to call this P2W.
---
Yey!!!! I did it!
---
I thought Bethesda said that they are working on increasing camp budget for fallout 1st members in the future... Its coming give them time... You just have to pay for it unfortunately lol
---
On the bright side, they can't do anything with the steel since they don't have the plans and can't sell it.
---
I read you, brother 😎👊
---
Nor did I. I haven't noticed that anything disappeared. Maybe it did and Bethesda has some kind of detection for this
---
Yeah, I’m really kicking myself right now, I had tons of flux saved, also just loads from hoarding workshops all day , every day, didn’t put a complaint in, because tons of people voiced their opinion and there didn’t seem to be anything being done about it, just really gutted that I kept quiet now :-(
---
PVP is getting stale unfortunately, I just want a mode that is identically like adventure but you can put a cap into anyone you want.
---
Wait really? I don't mind paying for more camp budget but when do they plan to add this? Lol because sooner than later would be rad!
---
It seems like wastelanders will “finish” the game so to speak. We have this nice sandbox full of junk and gear and events and player vending and social features but no character-driven stories. so I see it as the other “half” of what should be the best fallout game if done correctly. 
---
I would expect the quests, bug fixes, and QoL (legendary perks, perk loadouts) among the last free content updates as well as the other vault raids and further bug improvements. From there, you’ll have a nice complete game that is hopefully working correctly and should’ve been done for the most part at launch.
---
Then you can expect everything in the future beyond that in fallout 1st.
---
My camp sits right up against that spot. It would be great if they added the items in to continue the asthetic.
---
If you paid for first, you win 50 days of novice, standard, and expert steel, with which you can craft the most advanced armors in the game. That it isn't deliberate, doesn't change the result. That said, whoever set the vault 94 steel value at 150 should've known.
---
It's not that bad. Does is really affect you? I run all those five points and can't really complain. Speed demon and eagle eyes are worth the thirst.
---
The one where you okay music, can't remember the name. Upper corner where you can farm the goolies. They try to break the jukebox.
---
That would be pretty cool.
---
Id had a mechanic for my power armor shop and a medic / cook for my city.
---
yup.. thats what they should have done..
---
increase the stash limit by giving everyone a 2, 3 or 4 hundred pound scrapbox while making it infinite for FO1st subs...
---
that would indeed have been the smart play
---
Its the fire damage mod that causes "god mode". I use a Snappy capacitor on my BE laser and I never have this issue.
---
I'm pretty sure they said it in a stream or a post with the reveal of the fallout 1st and what it's going to offer at the start and in the future.. But the camp budget is the only future feature I remember because that got me hyped and most excited about fallout 1st
---
I just get the feeling that the issue was that they couldn't get their new monetization strategy to work. They've never hesitated to release buggy content in the past.
---
Hmmm, I need to look for this! If so that could hype me for 1st though I already have it ;D it will keep me buying it!
---
I find that the mags refill each time I swap servers, but that’s just me
---
Never noticed that, but I dont really pay attention to them.
---
A deathclaw with bloodied gauntlet that one shots you once you have them almost dead
---
that suuuucks.  i always wear those together
---
People who received 150 vault steel didn't have 150 vault steel. And people who had more than set their PC or console on fire when they realised they had lost it.
---
It's light, bit it's there. There was one time several weeks a go three of the higher ranked members including the elder, all in power armor with their rank paints, were defending Monongah Power Plant from a pair of pvp players in Outcast painted power armor. It was fun to watch and listen to the banter.
---
I felt the tools were lacking for a true open rp experience, theres only so much you can do in a videogame. Not to mention you couldnt effectively set roots or change the world really. No economy, no civilization, no rebuilding, no clans, limited customisation, just all the things that ive found in part in other games, failed to come together to build a real user world here.
---
"Cdkeys"
---
I need to try that now
---
praise be
---
&gt; +250 Damage Resist: The legendary weapon effect that provides +250 damage resistance while aiming is being addressed. With this upcoming fix, it will no longer suppress the weapon’s primary legendary attribute.
---
Uhm, isn't it 250 DR while reloading, not while aiming? Hopefully the person fixing the code isn't the one who wrote that update, or we'll end up with an ever weirder bug :P
---
Damn, that is a way to make things right. Didn't think they would give people that much.
---
Those are two different things.
---
Wut?
---
Just cause
---
It does actually, because it seems just after eating and drinking, my thirst and hunger are already halfway gone. There is no excuse for that to be happening, considering half gone from full is definitely not 15%. Love the mutation, but that is one of the many errors on bethesda's part.
---
Why are these grey market, honest question, my key was from them and no issues.
---
9990 Atoms for clean underpants
---
Again, it's free market capitalism.  You dont need to buy it and as they own the development and intellectual property of the fallout brand, BGS is within their rights to change it up, just as much as your right to show your distaste by abstaining from purchase.
---
I get many bought FO76 and feel it wasnt what they thought, but then ask for a refund and just move on.
---
I dont disagree this is scummy but welcome to real life.  No business that works doesnt have some scummy elements to it.  Again, you arent wrong that this is not a good look for them but they are just following the current business trend.  Most consoles rarely turn profit so in a society that wants good, quality games, they need to keep the well of cash flowing to pay these people.
---
Not saying greed isnt the main motivator but I think you will make your point a lot stronger by refusing to pay for anything FO76, rather than play and complain that it takes too long to get a cosmetic item.  Its cosmetic, not essential to the game dude.  THAT is the point here.
---
Scammers get scammed
---
This literally makes no sense
---
No, you don't just get it if you paid for 1st.  Like I said, I'm a 1st subscriber and I didn't get anything.  That's the part your missing.  People lost junk because of a bug, this is an attempt to make them whole and to basically say "we're sorry" for losing their stuff in the first place and taking 30 days to fix the issue. 
---
Any junk they had accumulated **over a year** of playing was lost in an instant, and it took 30 days for Bethesda to make it right.  Some people were overcompensated as a whole, some people were under compensated as a whole.  That's 30 days of not being able to benefit from the junk, which could include people who were about to craft gear but lost it and now couldn't do anything for 30 days because they didn't have what they accumulated
---
so no, you are still completely wrong on this being P2W, it is still just compensation for people who lost out due to a bug.  
---
The only people who should really be upset about this are the ones that don't even know and log into the wrong character first because they can't move the steel to the right character.
---
What's curious to me about the email is this part: *We will assume your issue has been resolved if we do not hear from you within 96 hours (4 days).*
---
What if I don't get my replacement scrap within that time and it's marked as resolved?
---
Only 60 levels to go then! Lol
---
Not really. "Better" beats 'superior' for some melee and unarmed mods. You can check it.
---
Sadyle there isnt a taunt optuon or a way to grab aggro in 76, which is why I like supressor. It you cant stop mobs from hitting others, you can at least mitigate how much damage they do.
---
Xbox, but thanks for the offer
---
Weird, I haven't gotten anything, but I lost scrap and had the email.
---
But it is broken. Is has been discussed here. Knuckles and baseball bats, for example.
---
*unstoppable monster begins tingling*
---
Take that to a private server sir
---
Hah. I was about to suggest a Rudolph the Rednosed Sheepsquatch.
---
I thought the +250 stayed on while crouched, but went away if hit by an enemy. I will have to test this again.
---
Ok then. I can see basically nobody's comments besides this guy hating on me
---
The patch before last (patch 14 I think?) They fixed the wallpaper so you could add or remove the wall paper without the things on the wall disappearing. Since the new patch it has gone back to things disappearing again. 
---
The first time I used wallpaper one of my power connectors disappeared and it took me ages to figure out why I had no power yet everything was repaired. It wasn't til I saw I had a power connector in stored that I realised what had happened.
---
Sometimes people put stuff in there. I used to put a bunch of stuff in that would help low levels
---
Cool, I'm glad that I contributed to your work a bit. But you confused the underarmor with the officer outfit I think.
---
Are they rolling it out slowly?
---
You mean to all players that didn't buy 1st
---
Man, I kinda wish you had included your gamertag in the post.
---
woah that's crazy...
---
OMG sorry I could have told you yes. 
---
\&gt;\_&lt;
---
Hope it wasn't something worth while.
---
Oh i see
---
Not true. Like you just said you had 4 out of 6 before when you had all the plans, plans come before steel plain and simple. This is agregious
---
I personally think the biggest problem is being able to respect your character however whenever you want. Need a scope on a rifle, just swap perks to make it, no need to travel the waste to find a gunsmith willing to work for you, same with armour and camp defences. Or even tracking down a locksmith or hacker to complete a quest ohhh just let me swap perks.... Being able to do everything yourself really stops you from having to interact with others and puts a damper on the RP possibilities.
---
Can I just transfer anything?
---
Yeah you give no links or supporting proof. Show where Bethesda has said this or kick rocks as bullshit
---
i agree, and thank you for breaking the math down.  if you dont mind im gonna share this thread to other posts that pop up
---
Just remember the guy who ran the vault raid and lost his character, got it back but 20 lvls prior.
---
yes - it will swap the model *(at least as of writing)* thats how it works.
---
It’s not pay to win. Nobody paid so that they could lose their scrap with the hope they may be reimbursed with something better. The replacement is good will. Company messed up and is compensating those who were impacted.
---
Are you sure he's not being disingenuous?  Or maybe he put in a ticket that he lost stuff but really didn't? 
---
None of the stuff is tradeable, so it doesn't trivialize anything.
---

---
Not mine, but there is the proof. 4 of those were given to FO1st subscribers hit by the scrapbox bug.
---
Preach brother, I'm done with this game now, been playing since beta and have hundreds of hours damn near a thousand and thos is the thanks I get for continually defending this game? Fuck this I'm out
---
So how is this pay to win?  If you have an issue with the amount of compensation, sure, but you said pay to win, so explain.
---
I did too. TY
---
Make 4 full sets of PA, trade for legacy items, p2w because none of that woulda happened without 1st
---
You get them straight away after you sign up.
---
Fallout1st broke the game. No point in playin if u have to pay. I will still come back on and wreck u tho, sellout. All those god rolls goin to waste.
---
As soon as you sign up.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/xKBEZmo
---
I mean (I play on pc) Instead press E like to loot something press R to be in transfer more. Then smoke grenades should appear on the right window and you can get them.
---
Haha I crafted a lvl 15 handmade, painted it, and destroyed it 
---
I wasn’t about to do it on a valuable legendary weapon 😂
---
I find it funny how everyone seems to think this is going out to “every” fo1st member (if so prove me wrong) but I’m a member and pretty sure I wont be receiving this as I wasn’t affected.
---
I’m on xbox
---
Hopefully they said fuck it and all updates will now be free or they decided to lower their prices.
---
Luckily I found a guy selling them cheap.. I feel ya man
---
I know what your saying.  I’ll give it a shot
---
Yeah we didn't pay to be given such vast amounts of free shit, and they definitely needed a grand gesture to get back in the player's good graces. Could they have left the vault steel out? Yeah but then people would complain about the copious amounts of flux
---
Because his they get the keys is shady. And they take advantage of regional pricing.
---
This would help you find legendary weapons that you are interested in.  You start taking massive damage from something that has a "hot" weapon and you know it is a fight worth having.   Been disappointed since day 1 beta of this game that the mobs can shoot you with weapons they don't actually have on them.
---
Bubblegums are speed demons' friends. You slow the hunger/thirst by half, canceling the mutation side effect for 10min. Flavored bubblegums are better in fight if you need the extra bonus and slow hunger/thirst to stay well fed/hydrated.
---
The Tap out clothing is a clothing line... Same with Crocs, it is why they have disgusting things like "croc high heels" now: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/high-heel-crocs-shoes-are-selling-out-prompting-questions-of-why/
---
It seems you are the one that doesn't know what they are talking about when you ignore things like the 100+$ axe skin from Apex. That was mocked so badly they removed it from the game for that price. So claiming mocking is pointless is proven wrong, as it got Apex to change the price on their insanely over priced skin.
---
If you buy a shovel from Amazon but it never gets delivered to you, you can get a free replacement of equal value. That’s a replacement made in good will.
---
They will not, however, send you a new shovel, gloves, a winter hat, snow boots, a snowblower, anti freeze, snow tires, a month’s supply of firewood, and a new four wheel drive SUV with zero mileage on it as a “good will” replacement.
---
It is a 1 time thing. People aren't buying these scrap items. So it is by definition, not pay to win. If you have issue with what they contain, sure, but they are not items for sale.
---
Got a photo of it. 
---
True. As I've mentioned since I had a conversation with the head of Zenimax Australia and said I'd give them a chance to see how this sorts itself out. Nothing changes if you refuse to negotiate
---
At least give it to everyone who has 1st, now I wish I had this fucking bug.
---
Fought 12 at once in a nuke zone... killed me twice, after killing the scorchbeast queen without incident.
---
Utter bastards they are.
---
yut, I'm not getting anything either.
---
Still not 600
---
They did pay tho
---
Oh ok. Then I will add that. Thank u
---
They said they can't replace what was lost specifically, so this is their "one solution fits all" idea. Otherwise some would complain it is not enough. Would you have them just do nothing?
---
My adhesive farm takes up so much budget :(
---
Only to those affected.  Not every 1st player is what he was referring to.
---
Say what you will but IMHO they are definitely going above and beyond to make the affected individuals whole. 
---
Essentially *(I know the caveat about plans)* giving people the ability to make a Vault Suit &amp; more then full flux restoration is a def. a CS power move imho.
---
4x of those CSR kits is v. generous considering their gamut. I did **not** expect that and am pleasantly surprised given the . . . terroir as of late.
---
Is it the same thing with bandanas?  I noticed I'm not able to wear a bandana with the prisoner collar anymore either.  I'm pretty sure I could in the past.
---
Not every 1st player.
---
I try to keep my store stocked with 5 for each serum. So i don't ruin my stash space.
---
Which is what I stated in the post you've replied to.
---
&gt;4 of those were given to FO1st subscribers hit by the scrapbox bug.
---
What about people who did lose vault steel?
---
yes I understand and upvoted you.  sorry I wasn't arguing with you personally.
---
They didn't pay for the items specifically. They are compensation items for a screwup. Otherwise, where do I buy mine?
---
Yeah, just like they did with the dozens of people losing items before Fallout 1st.
---
Please tell us that you are working on a fix for the Strangler Heart Power Armor freezing the game on certain hardware
---
you're funny
---
I have Fallout 1st and I have used scrap boxes in all my 4 characters for like month now without any issues at all whatsoever. It definitely doesn't delete junk, and if it happens to do so, Bethesda better give something of value back, like that vault steel... so I see no issue.
---
So they should be compensated also. If they weren’t, complain about that. Complaining that people were remedied when the software malfunctioned is a bit absurd.
---
That's usually the one thing that you can count on working. Lol
---
Cool, but not pay to win. Try again.
---
I'm talking about vast amounts. I shouldn't have said left it out completely. They could have given more conservative amounts than what is posted, but that still isn't right for those people with junk mules
---
I had a food/water farm going on that could feed anyone anytime and had to remove it if I wanted something nice looking ;D
---
Should have bought Fallout 1st. Many people who didn't submit a ticket are getting their compensation scrap anyway, like my best friend.
---
Ok shill
---
They said they couldn’t identify what specifically was lost by people, so offered this generous package so no one was short changed. If they could identify and restore specifically what was lost they would have.
---
yut it does
---
They weren't, they complained, and nothing happened. Are you new around here?
---
No, I'm just not an idiot.
---
Anyone who disagrees with you is a shill apparently.
---
Doesn't mean he didn't lie to Bethesda to try and get compensation that wasn't due. 
---
I don't remember 100% what your suit was about, IIRC something about 1st and trying to hold them to "everything being free" even though at the same time Pete Hines made the comment about the atom shop, in nearly the same breath (though not quoted as such by anyone, not surprisingly) that the private servers were going to be subscription based.
---
Be someone could have lost that amount..... this way no one is short changed
---
600 vault steel + atom PA trading glitch = dozen legacy items, or a strangler PA set for you and the whole family
---
To clarify I’m only concerned about the Vault steel.
---
It’s the hardest material to earn. It’s limited how much you can get per day. It’s not tradeable. And it lets you build some of the most powerful items in the game which then can break the economy through trading and duping exploits and other people’s games.
---
I busted my ass to earn the 162 Vault steel required to create my Strangler Heart armor. I know how much work it takes to earn it, and in turn how unlikely it is that more than 5% of players deposit more than 100 Vault steel into their buggy scrapbox.
---
600 for everyone is obscene. If they made it a lot lower and then looked at Vault 94 challenges completion to reward extra to the appropriate players this would be lot less contentious.
---
Could drop info what platform you on. Not sure if I would join up with you today as Im currently hunting for legendaries, but could always add you for some other time :)
---
Ok since.
---
No bro im serious. Loved the game. Sad to see it go. Cant keep up with the cheaters who have unlimited resourses cause they pay more lmao. Give me a day to grind tho, and ill make enough 556 to wreck u and ur team.. promise :)
---
Reread what I wrote. If an item is deleted and they aren’t restored due to a flaw in the software, you are justified in complaining. You people are complaining because Bethesda actually did the right thing in this situation
---
Good point.  I play on PC and I only play on my days off.  Sun - Tues
---
That wastelanders thing is pure BS. They just want to get more cash out of us without providing meaningful fixes aka real work.
---
   There is no way fixing the 250 bug would affect the wastelanders update. Also, some of these bugs are here since forever, they're not going away.
---
Good idea that will be hated because 600 vault steel :(
---
Attaboy 😎👊
---
Likes OP said, I doubt there's been enough time in game since vault raids were introduced to actually receive vault steel in that amount, but we are in agreement regardless. Some people WOULD have been shortchanged in everything else more than likely, except for maybe flux. Doubt many people were keeping 1500 pounds o that
---
yes thats excactly what i said. you dont start with 0 steel when you have the plans. thank you for understanding.
---
Make sure your graphics card is updated.
---
I complain because they do the right thing, only with people who pay a monthly fee.
---
I\`m actually shocked us Europeans have something cheaper for once. Not gloating at all, just odd really why this is the case.
---
Eh, I honestly don’t feel impacted. My experience hasn’t changed. I think they did the right thing here.
---
Not my business, I glitch this part :shrug:. Lazy people just find the quickest way to do the main thing.
---
giving that much steel should not be limited to just 1st members, im not one and it took my mixed first/no first teams 2 months to grind that much
---
Cool will drop you a friend invite later, might meet up some day :)
---
Yep, those are popular spots to put extra stuff that might help someone else. So enjoy.
---
They should have the issues remedied. Everyone should. Your are misplacing your outrage.
---
I use a full set of heavy combat with the blood stained skin an the gladiator helmet from nuclear winter along side my bloodied ss gronak axe.
---
Feel like a heavy full plated knight destroying my enemies with my trusty axe.
---
You're living the dream my friend
---
they are not buying them because fhey are untradeable
---
you are getting THE end game gear you did not enter the raids for after paying a fee and experiencing a buf
---
\+1 I move my camp every week or so. Building from scratch with a maxed out budget is not exactly fun when one tries to make something completely new.
---
I have Fallout 1st. I don't run the raids. Vault steel is completely useless to me because (1) You cannot sell it (2) You cannot trade it (3) Even if I was to run the raids now the chances of me getting the plans in a short amount of time even if I were to grind it every day are low. Not to mention, there are actually people who run the raid daily and get the 12 per day. That is only 50 days if you actually grind it out every day. Just because you took off from playing the game and abandoned your old raid group doesn't mean others have a low amount of vault steel like you.
---
I'm pretty sure the loot is rolled after the enemy is killed plus each person that tags the enemy gets a different legendary rng roll. Though it would be frightening to have a sheepsquatch come drilling towards you.
---
Compensate everyone, or compensate no one. That's how it should be. There can't be justice for only a privileged few.
---
Isn’t like everyone that’s been handed the 609 vault steel has the plans to craft the armour with the steel though, so will still have to grind for those...
---
could you link that for us please.  I haven't seen the list yet.  thank you
---
Love it but santa-claws is a bit lacking, I was thinking Death Claus
---
That isn't pay to win though. Unreasonable compensation, sure, but not pay to win by any stretch of the term.
---
I have a question. If I get 600 vault steel, but I don't have any of the Vault 94 plans did I win?
---
&gt; People used to trade MULTIPLE legacies for stranger heart armor when they first came out, so hopefully that helps to contextualize just how insanely good it is.
---
 Also how insanely duping of legacies was.
---
Magazines/end bobble??
---
Adrenal for bloodied builds
---
Talons or twisted or both for melee builds (Someone please correct me if I am wrong)
---
Egg head is nice to counter the negative modifiers to intelligence, so is eagle eyed.
---
Some people would appreciate niche serums like herd mentality or empath - When you run an alt in a second box the modifiers are extra handy.
---
They compensated most recent verified bug. Hopefully they do this with the next one.. hold off your whining until then.
---
You can say it's over generous, but you can't say it's P2W. 
---
People put a ton of scrap into scrap box *they paid a premium for* and lost all the scrap that they may have spent upwards of a year accumulationg. **A years worth of junk gone.** They submit a ticket and then it takes Bethesda **30 days** to fix the issue.  It took the **entire whole month of the affected players subscription** to fix the issue.  
---
And while the vault steel (which really is the only thing anyone even cares about) there are players who **lost more than what's being compensated and now have useless vault steel** because they don't even do the raid. 
---
Now imagine being someone who logged onto the wrong character and got the boxes when their main is the one with the plans.  Those are the only people who really should be mad.
---
A deathclaw with a walking cane would be dope...
---
Loosing my junk, and get vault steel that i dont even have plans for yet? If you lost 3k acid, hundreds of flux, 8k lead, 4 full set of that PA would not be enough
---
I like it! Reminds me of the vendors you could get for settlements in FO4.
---
Wouldn't surprise me, but somebody who didn't put in a ticket said they were given it as well. Also it's shame on BGS for the quantum of steel they gave despite anything he may or may not have done.
---
It's actually from before first, I snapped with the fridge, given earlier patience with the scrap and repair kits. My submission, brief of evidence, and the specific legal statutes are below. Be interested in hearing your thoughts, I tried to be fair
---

Scorched will use Gamma Guns...
---
Ha! One of his minions got me too, then she outed him and one of his alt reddit accounts.  Those scammers are like spider webs.
---
Really love your Ideas.
---
 Let's just hope that this time Bethesda listens, and is nice, and not naughty.
---
 Like the Halloween event that cost everyone dearly! If you wanted to dress up your camp abit. 
---
I really can't stand the costs associated with this game. It just seems so unjustified. Especially after spending what I have already spent on this game, and extra atoms over the first year. Close to $300 CAD. I should receive a Fallout 1st membership for free.  Not trying to be sinicle here. 
---
I could have bought 3 new games at this point! Go figure. 
---
I am only assuming it will be something that's stupid, and will crash every time you go to do the event. Or I will be forced to play Nuclear Winter, to receive a  few Christmas cosmetic Items. Like they have done in the past. No real balance for Adventure mode. 
---
Nonetheless I wish you,and everyone the best!
---
This game is actually dead
---
Wastelanders won't save this
---
I'm sorry
---
Except they aren't actually carrying it. Their item loadout is generated for you after they die.
---
No thank you. Love my infinite scrap junk. Finnally can have 8k glass that i will never use.
---
Makes me sad man :(
---
Better they give the freebies to all or none, if they don't want 1st members mass quit...
---
This may not be popular opinion, but I like their solution to the disappearing scrap issue.
---
it's gonna be ok bro no worries
---
Did you check?  Are the two you placed still in place?
---
&gt; People used to trade MULTIPLE legacies for stranger heart armor
---
Hell, I'd trade some legacies for a copy of the PA.
---
I use a flamer pretty frequently. While getting ammo is tedious, it's not its biggest problem. It's ridiculously low durability is hands down its biggest problem.
---
Up voted, and i wish i could up vote you a 100 times ;)
---
Lmao what? It was fastest to shoot 2 times and keep going
---
but why would 1st players quit if we didn't loose anything in the first place?
---
No!... Wait, yes. I meant Yes.
---
50 days of grinding the raid 3 times isn't nothing, if you'd done it, you'd realise what you're saying, in both time and resources.
---
I didn't abandon my raid group, it was an ugly divorce
---
I'm as guilty as the next human but it is somewhat cathartic to vent bile against a target that cannot retaliate, it is not healthy and I try to self moderate, I better go read my post history.
---
Regular junk would have been just fine, they shouldn't have been given flux and vault steel.
---
Yup, i originally envisioned it as my “spare playable characters”.
---
My idea was to make cool characters with a specific load out and ill change between them.
---
For example im playing as my Detective set up but when i want to change thing up i would change my character appearance to that of the doctors appearance and then proceed to change the doctor appearance to that of the detectives.
---
That way is as i always have those set characters in my camp and just choose which one i want to take into an adventure for the day.
---
probably salty from people getting “free” vault steel. I had some dude message me saying so too but has 0 proof of losing anything
---
I won't, sorry if that hurts your shill feelings.
---
Oh really?
---
That's a separate issue. This is just how do we make it baseline better for everyone while simultaneously helping Bethesda's bottom line. Everyone could win with something similar to this approach.
---
This was a screw up on Bethesda's part, and they made it right.
---
I lost a lot. So did a few of my friends. 
---
While this doesn't make up for what we lost, it's still a great thing to do.
---
Aww shit now I regret not signing up for it.
---
Hell yeah if Graham was wearing a Santa hat alone that would be great! That'd crack me up.
---
I lost more flux than that
---
Hi if you could just indulge my curiosity why are people getting free vault steel?
---
Hmm, yes, a 3* Legendary Super Mutant Overlord using a Bloodied Faster Fire Rate Handmade. Better come prepared.
---
They already mentioned it is bug but i guess it’s easier to cry on Reddit rather than searching
---
There are times that the keys are stolen or obtained through other ill gotten means.  You actually can see complaints from indie developers who'd rather you just pirate the game than try to buy it from one of these sites since dealing with refunds (when the key wasn't sold by them in the first place) actually hurts them. 
---
example: [https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/17/g2a-key-gift-game-developers-explained/](https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/17/g2a-key-gift-game-developers-explained/)
---
Yes this is good
---
Dear God this. Costumes are fun but that limit tho....
---
So reddit can't stop complain all the time and when they try a lot of people still complain.
---
If you hate complain posts so much - please move onto a subreddit/post that you enjoy.
---
Taking in excessive negative content  all of the time is not good for your mental health &amp; is also not actually achieving anything.
---
 Imagine if something actually important went wrong in your life - does this help explain the escalating violence in the world? 
---
Lighten up people - it's only people voicing their opinion.
---
The quest that starts it all is the rumor of a mysterious pole in the ground at the northern most point of the map.
---
from lost junk through the scrap box at first release. people are being compensated with large amounts of junk including upto 600 vault steel
---
No it wouldn’t lol
---
I would loooove this! Great ideas!
---
Wow oh yeah i can see why if thats the case then thanks for elaborating liitle behind on the latest 76 news.
---
 acheivinfmg
---
I know it takes a lot of effort and resources to do the raids. Do YOU know though? Because according to my sources you would beg for stims and ammo every time you'd start raiding and never pay it back. I also heard that you would abandon your raid group to play NW instead of raid and then cry when they would post to try and get a fourth. I also know you would harass the female member of your raid group by jumping into her private world and follow her around spamming her chat invites. 
---
If that's how you act I'd divorce you too.
---
This is so logically badass. Mall Santa ghouls or something of the sort, it's Halloween around the day the bombs fell but that would still be cool. If content can be created that plugs it in that is gold.
---
Reporting bugs does more than complaining about bugs. 
---
I admit - maybe I am crazy, but I've put in over 1700 hours into this game &amp; I've never done that before. Really liked fallout 3, got bored in New Vegas &amp; 4, 1 &amp; 2 were game changers of their time &amp; I even liked tactics. 
---
For me it is addictive &amp; although it has many issues, it has become my all time favourite game.
---
This makes me more hopeful, definitely a good article this week.
---
I am also intrigued by the picture challenge.  Most of my good pictures were taken in Photomode but hopefully that does not matter.
---
Are they? Im sure it’s just those who submitted a ticket
---
If placed before the patch they both remain in place stating 2/1. Remove it and it won't let you place it back, already made my ticket.
---
There is lots to complain about, but it's not going to change anything! 
---
Exactly - enjoy the game for what it is. It's an absolute buggy mess and not the Fallout game everyone was expecting, but it still is pretty good and I've been enjoying it since December and I'm still looking forward to playing. 
---
Tbh that's probably the longest any game has kept my interest continuously for!
---
The raider american flag one works with it. I am not sure if it's actual name however I do use it with the prisoner collar along with my imposter set and mothman goggles.
---
Wearing unyielding armor and bloodied when you die i suppose?
---
 To start, I don't believe this company has the ability to control who exactly lost some scrap (and how much) and who did not. 
---
 And just by pure experience in life. When two customers pay the same for one thing, and one of them, receives a lot more than the other one, problems arrive... Natural.
---
So when do we get this vault steel
---
I don’t get why people come here to slam the game. It’s like if I went on the cats subreddit to say how much I hate cats. I get the hate posts on gaming or the fallout subreddit but here should be about the gameplay itself. It’s been a year haters, move on.

And, to point out, while about half of that stuff has been bugging us since launch the other half is stuff that got borked during one of the updates. 
---
I'm glad there's the fixes on the horizon and I'm curious how Wastelanders will be, but all in all that's not really a 'huge deal' nor a lot of information.
---
You can’t take it away now.  Only hope they plan better next time.
---
Once I have linked the key I bought with my Bethesda Account and the game is activated I'm presuming I am safe as noone else can use this key.
---
The emailed key did come as a scan of a key printed on a CD so this must have been a retail box, hope it wasn't stolen.
---
ok I can see how some people could feel that way
---
You young uns’ and yer ammo wastin’!
---
That last thing was really inadvertent. However the former was dependent on me getting home and needing to raid immediately due to time differences with the team, having given other things like faschnacht masks and other goodies to try to make up for it. I would play nw when I had small time periods, never cared about anybody else joining the team that much, except when I left and was replaced by a member of the aristocracy. Happy you've got your steel King, my apologies to kt
---
It's not really pay-to-win.  It's the company overcompensating for something that went wrong.
---
True, this sub should be about helping others with game info etc &amp; general questions.
---
Maybe a "All we ever do is complain" sub should be started. That way the useless rants that don't actually achieve anything can have a proper place to be heard &amp; not infest a once informative &amp; decent sub.

Lol. You are the one acting upset.
---
No shit, that's the point of Fallout 1st...
---
Deus Vult!
---
Can you elaborate on what you mean by “take it away”? The idea here is to give everyone a limited scrapbox, and FO1st would upgrade that scrapbox to infinite weight. No one would “lose” anything, except maybe FO1st members who think the Scrapbox isn’t as exclusive anymore (they would still have a substantially superior scrapbox though).
---
My man 😎👊
---
Apparently.
---
Yep, I wish people would vote with their wallets.
---
I try roleplaying; people either make fun of me or immediately try to kill me.
---
No no. My mistake.  I misread.  My fault here :)
---
&gt; Some of us don't go back to camp for days at a time. 
---
I hadn't thought of that, what are you doing away from the camp for so long, fast travel is so cheap and the game bleeds caps.
---
Your right FO4 had something called Creation Club, so did Skyrim.

Bethesda fixed the issue by making modding illegal/not supported. So you pay $18 for simple mods such as skins for power armor.
---
Yup. I had it today. I wasn't even impacted by the bug so I have so much junk now I don't have to grind. This is sad. I actually didn't want it.
---
One of the biggest hurdles for RP was the server setup. I would bet if we were given the ability to have private servers with persistent camps, plus the ability to make more than one camp, RP servers would have been amazing. 
---
Essentially I'm thinking along the lines of rust or ark.
---
You were replaced by someone who actually pulls his own weight and doesn't whine about everything. This holier than thou attitude you have just because you don't have Fallout 1st calling people aristocrats just makes you look like a salty little boy who didn't get his favorite toy. 
---
Also I know you threatened to leave the game because that female raid member wouldn't give you her strangle heart arm so you "could be symetrical" right after she made it.
---
Get out here with that bologna you peasant.
---
Yeah but it has a lot of different cassets or holotapes inside, why not let us change it to other songs.
---
Im willing to bet you got free scrap today
---
I thought bloodied builds instantly melt in PVP, pumpkin grenades, plasma weapons etc. I've never dared even try.
---
I did get an email, but not sure if I got scrap, but I replied to bethesda saying I'm unaware that I lost anything so I don't deserve it
---
Fitting
---
Nop, i have around 80 for about a 3 months, all still full
---
uh wtf
---
I have it. That's really strange that the stuff is not showing up in the atom shop, maybe try restarting Fallout 76 or if you're in console power cycling your console
---
But after you read your thesaurus
---
Also, have you played Fallout 76 before or did you get the game with the pack? See if you can craft the outfit at an armor workbench
---
I really miss Survival mode. It felt scary, my nerves always shot up when I played. I had to sneak around and turn off my mic. I had to hide atop apartment complexes until it was night to sneak to my next destination.
---
Bad analogy, as these items cost Bethesda the total of a **nothing**, it's just pixels on a screen.
---
Oh ok thanks for clarification
---
Bloodied explosive automatic suppressed 10 mm pistol with faster reload or less vats i have one and its a tank
---
Vultcano?
---
People will complain about everything, Bethesda can never win.
---
I love the game but it really feels like a slap in the face when I've spent hundreds of hours grinding Vault 94 for a few hundred vault steel when any FO 1st player gets 600 just for being subscribed. I would literally subscribe right now if I was able to get the vault steel.
---
No ability to write text. I absolutely hate talking in these games. I will rp in ESO in text, but won't stand there and sound like a moron trying to talk to others.
---
This rant just goes to show you, no matter what Bethesda does to fix something they messed up on, people are going to complain.
---
Yeah they do but by the time you find them when they come out of chameleon they VATS crit you in the head, its just hard to get up close. And the closer you get the higher the hit chance is as well.
---
I gotta fuel my chem addiction somehow.
---
Its the same as my reddit
---
Interesting, I'm PVE, I'd better stay with it think.
---
Excellent point
---
I'd say bloody, +10 when aiming, 25% less vats cost. Explosive is not sneaky.
---
Add adrenaline and it's pretty good on groups too.
---
That’s where the issues lie, you buy the key and then the key is put back out for sale, later someone buys it and finds the key was already used
---
The trick isn't to really go up to each one, as much as swing your target over them while mashing Use.  As long as you're in the general area, you'll break it.
---
But but Bethesda completely ruined my life! Every decision they make is the worst thing ever done in the history of the world! I have to constantly complain about every single thing that happens, from the newsletters, to patches! 
---
Huge /S😜
---
I was referring to the Wasteland Workshop DLC, not Creation Club.
---
I'm also not sure why you're linking me feedback about Creation Club. How it was received has nothing to do with my response. You said that the idea 'would of been comical', suggesting that it didn't exist, and I noted that it actually does exist. I wasn't suggesting it was well received or a good idea.
---
As far as modding for 76, Bethesda said it's coming up. It may not allow cosmetics modding, we don't know yet. We do know cosmetics mods are freely allowed in FO4 alongside Creation Club, so it's a bit premature to rule it out completely.
---
As far as paying $18 for skins, I agree that it's a ridiculous price. Unfortunately that's an industry standard, not a Bethesda special, so until gamers figure out a way to change the whole industry's mind-- and stop whales from spending-- it's not likely to change.
---
I wouldn’t use melee at all since pvp meta is commando at the moment . Find a ffr automatic handmade.
---
Nice. That’s what i assumed would be the pick but I didn’t know if there’s a sleeper out there.
---
not really a grind though, the steel is the grind and limiting factor
---
If you didn’t enter raids you don’t have plans to craft the gear
---
Now that is a point, I don't actually own the physical unique item, oh dear, now I see how this is a problem, I shan't use them or similar again. Thanks for the heads up 👍
---
This entirely. I lost all of my stuff that I collected over a year of playing. I put in a ticket, got an email, but haven't received any items either (even though the email said I would).
---
I do agree that the Vault Steel is a bit excessive, but all the other items are far from enough for a lot of folks.
---
And the majority of people on this subreddit hate the vault Raid &amp; are downvoting the hell out of these types of posts because they want free Raid Armor, that bug with the scrapbox didn't last a week ,so why are some people getting insanely amount of Vault steel when you could have only gotten around 84 Vault Steel in that 1 week?
---
which takes under 25%of the time investment of hitting the steel
---
Year subscriber here. I didn’t get anything nor did I lose anything. I think all players should get the scrap box for Christmas.
---
Im a bloodied build and i mostly pvp only. Id say I'm more of a tank then most full heath builds.
---
Just all in your play style. 
---
You can't use Deathclaw in power armor
---
You want damage? BE Western Revolver can reach 700 before the Adrenaline Perk. I have 2 BE westerns and 2 BE .44. Do NOT get a .44 because it has way lower damage. The single action is also weaker, but has style points.
---
The gunslinger is some of the best fun I've had. Perfect at Vats and AP.
---
No you aren’t...you have the steel but still need the plans to craft. You still have to run the raids...
---
The holy land! We protect it with our lives!

"Private worlds will continue to evolve with new features such as  expanded building areas, increased C.A.M.P. budgets and Workshop  persistence. We’ve also received a lot of questions about playing  Fallout 76 with mods and this, too, is something we’re excited to add to  private worlds in the future. "
---
There is no stated date, so it's nice to hear they're increasing it but they could be talking about a year from now for all we know. My bet though is that they'll increase it either in December for Christmas (to keep people subbed) or around January/February with Wastelanders.
---
The scrap box is something everything should have. It's a QoL item that makes the game way less grindy and more fun.
---
You realize that the smoke gen is as intensive as an blood effects right? So basically if someone crashed cause of that one extra smoke gen, they would crash the moment they killed an enemy... It would also mean if someone used a flamer near them, they'd crash.
---
So no, their PC would have to be more than a little dated. It would have to be BELOW minimum requirements and they shouldn't be playing the game anyway.
---
So don't call me an asshole because I don't care about the person playing the game on a PS2 being unable to load the smoke.
---
It’s people like this that will make Bethesda think it’s okay to do this to everyone again. Lol
---
Yes! Protect it from the neck beards and the weeds!
---
Can you move them around if you'd already placed 2?
---
Thanks. I’ve got some choices to make in the Agility perk tree. Gotta have 3 sneak/action boy. Love gun fu, but then you have all the handgun perks in there. Doesn’t leave much for Adrenaline!
---
He likes your use of words :)

Guys i have a silly question, do i have to make a ticket or they will add this automatically? I lost of my junk due to that bug but i didn't believe that they will do anything about that and i didn't make a ticket when it happened.
---
so no weapons from many of the legendary enemies. mostly armors?
---
have fun with doing absolutely nothing for the vault steel
---
Ok? So now they need to do raids otherwise they just have a bunch of useless steel. Honestly I don’t see the big deal. You want an oompa loompa now, I know. Calling this p2w is absurd though. Nobody bought 1st so they could get free vault steel.
---
But people would scream “pay to wiiin, reeeeee!”. Tbh that would be kinda cool tho.
---
Oh if you have the email but haven't received one yet maybe they're rolling them out in waves or something
---
Its one of my a favourite weapons i made a new character just to compliment the build lol.
---
So you're getting the scrap for free, which is exactly why most of us are furious. 600 vault steel is fucking outlandish
---
I wish radstorms and other weather effects were actually meaningful. Game needs a survival-heavy hardmode. xD
---
Camp looks cool though, great background.
---
You actually grind a lot more once you have it, it doesn't come with any junk when you get it lol
---
Playing only on public there's definately a visible difference between random groups of players joining compared to groups formed specifically for SBQ hunting, so it seems maybe it's just players with better builds and gear?
---
Although you lost more, are you pretty happy with their solution?
---
Just don't store or scrap it and you should be good
---
It took me two extra weeks to get my last three power armor plans when I get all the steel needed. It’s still rng. I personally think 600 was a bit generous, but it’s Bethesda’s decision.
---
I don’t think it’s right to be critical of a company who actually made the issue right to the people that experienced the issue.
---
This has also been happening for me most recently.
---
How sweet of him, I'm sending him a juice box via the mythical miasmas.
---
I started grinding less after I got it. I didn't feel like I had to always farm stuff since I had enough space to stock up once every few sessions instead of every time I play
---
It's untrue about the holding weight thing because I used to run objectives whilst other people laid down suppressing fire. In terms of Fallout 1st, I am, and will remain, salty, as somebody who didn't stay playing during the free week, but who was there at the beginning. BGS engaged in anti consumer practices and I almost guarantee that the case I put before VCAT will be upheld. You think it's petulant and I completely understand and respect that opinion, but I'm not driven by anything other than what the game was, a meritocracy. 1st changed that, as exhibited by the vault steel.
---
That second thing is untrue. I said I can't be bothered grinding and if she couldn't either I'd buy it. I was sick of the raid crashing, and apologised right afterwards because I knew it was selfish and unfair to ask.
---
I have 1st, for the stashbox, and I'll stick with what I'm doing until everybody gets one. That's what they promised, that's what Australian law
