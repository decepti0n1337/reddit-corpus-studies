Steelheart either needs a major buff to his defense or the ability to revive like Mr. Messenger. Some of the ferals will kill him in one hit. It's laughable that a police Protectron is weaker than a courier Mr. Handy.
---

---
Morgantown being a low level area has probably caused Back on the Beat to make new players hesitant to even attempt more events because of how unfair and unforgiving the event is.
---
---
---
There's a bug with it related to exiting and entering power armor. Maybe that's what you're seeing? Unequipping and re-equipping the weapon will fix it.
---
I had the same amount of excitement until I saw how bright and clean the barn paint was - I'm sure plenty of people would love that but I grew to love the weathered look of the barn tiles from Far Harbor so it was disappointing I wouldn't be able to get the same look.
---
This might sound petty but I don't buy from floating camp vendors. TBH, I could care less if anyone is butthurt by my statement. Play the game as it's meant to be played and stop using exploits/glitches.
---
74 I'm pretty sure
---
Yeah like, why didn't they think about that haha. Maybe it's slightly exploitable but that's still better than people getting attacked and diseased just because.
---
I wish people could get Bethesda to awknowledge the problem at least so se could get any solution to make spawns at least a little better. Hell, just making fast travel mats only work on the Camp owner would already be a huge improvement.
---
I sometimes do, sometimes don't. Also don't gaf if someone thinks it looks funny.
---
Hmmm.. good to know. I hope it isn't one of the buggy one, but at least there's still hope. Thank you
---
It's an atom shop item that's not available right now. I'm sure it'll come back at some point though.
---
I mean, I don’t walk into a Rolls Royce dealership expecting to drive off the lot in a new sedan with $30k in my bank account. I’d hope people keep their expectations realistic and not expect to afford a top end gun with their first lvl 100 character. The same goes for a lvl 300 browsing a low level camp in the Forest. They’re obviously not going to have an upgrade to your gear, and that should be perfectly acceptable.
---
Advertisements as attractors sounds fun to me. Someone showing off a few rare outfits is obviously a good place to visit for players that like cosmetics. There doesn’t seem to be any harm in it.
---
Stop by mine when I am on gt is GrumpyDude.  Mine has all metal support posts from the ground up. All my buildings look like the float m, but all have ground supports. I kind of defy the odds I guess....lol
---
2? That sounds awesome.
---
Hi on gt is grumpydude.  mine has all metal support posts from the ground up. all my buildings look like the float m, but all have ground supports. i kind of defy the odds i guess....lol, I'm dad.
---
Happy cake day
---
Heard they're doing perk load outs. I want them too. Lol.
---
I use those on new characters because it’s easy to place back down. Once I get caps and am level 40+ it’s time to settle down, but in the early game I’m always moving my camo so I just slap a few pieces of wood together and it works.
---
Modus comes off as a bit creepy and doesn't have the same feeling that Rose gives off. She seems human, despite not being one.
---
How about even copying the floor mesh to the pre existing stair case even and making that easier to snap to stuff... And making the floor meshes on the half and quarter floors as well... Please please please
---
All rng, I never received The Tenderizer on my toons lvl210 and 145 but my lvl 15 toon got it twice already with the Red Firework and Salty plan...
---
You seem to be more upset by the fact that I’m complaint about a game than I am about the things I complained about.
---
I was pissed in the moment when I posted what I posted, then I felt better.  Big fucking deal.  Get off my ass about it. 
---
If I decided to write a journal and cry every goddamn night of my life, it shouldn’t concern you.
---
The power of Christ compelled him...
---
So... Steam's trading system?
---
I now have gunsmith 5 for crafting and 2-3-4 to fill in for whatever i feel like playing. I certainly didn't pick that many but once i figured it out was happy
---
I feel like you're gonna struggle mightily as a melee player in Nuclear Winter.
---
Did you start during the beta?
---
How is this even a question. Energy resistance is next to useless in this game and shouldn't really be a factor in any decision making.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---

---
Vats bugginess gets me everytime. Three straight 98% hit chances tries -clean misses- no damage. Toggle vats and now it works.... Ugh.
---
I'll admit it can be just as frustrating. "Fast travel bug...working on it." lol
---
Doesn't the game make new .inis if you delete the messed up ones?
---
I'm down for running around. Don't have a two-shot fatman but I can make a MIRV version. What level are you?
---
Oh my, a mirv fat man, as a turret, that would be insane.  And fun.
---
It's in Luck. Very helpful whenever you're crafting something.
---
I’m not upset. I’m disgusted. You’re absolutely right that I shouldn’t be concerned, but it’s painful and vaguely terrifying that so many people have the inability to better their own lives. Whether it’s a silly video game or an actual career, the solution is identical. If all the whiners I’ve ever met didn’t all wind up to be losers, I wouldn’t have responded beyond my initial post.
---
Despite my experience, I suppose I’m hoping someone will actually quit whining, improve their game, take that attitude to their actual life and achieve some success in their field of interest.....or at least develop some discipline and tenacity in the process.
---
Someone nuked Morgantown and I saw the notification for this queat pop up, so I said to myself, "this ought to be a laugh" and activated Steelheart.
---
The wandering bloated glowing ones weren't interested in Steelheart at all.  The other two people who joined in were mostly twiddling our thumbs, as almost no ghouls spawned while Steelheart dorked around with the locks.
---
I was a little disappointed.
---
Good bot!
---
I'm not too familiar with steam so possibly
---
I keep hearing that. I might mod my fixer as .38 seeing as I’m stealth based. So the damage won’t be too bad.
---
Hi not too familiar with steam so possibly, I'm dad.
---
This is part of why I never get mad at people building floating bases. I built my super cool house, and now I can NEVER move. xD
---
I'm not too familiar with dad
---
I saw someone on the market selling .38 8k for 1k in caps.
---
Met Some guy once to trade and asked about all his .38 he gave 4k for free. Amazing stores have it for 0 caps. Gun runs its self.
---
That which you said and I would be so happy if I could snap a regular floorboard to a foundation and if snapping was a toggle option.
---
And less strict in colliding with world options like being able to really attach a floorboard to a tree or existing world structures.
---
I do realise that bethesda didn't want people to make actual floating camps but now I also see these physics ignoring monstrosities that hurt my soul.
---
I actually made a few easy to replace one foundation camps as I think that is the reason people build said monstrosities but it is indeed a challenge in finding work arounds if you want to keep it nice and immersive looking.
---
And the pipe conduits could use a rework as well. Like vertical pipes without the corners attached and upwards pointing seperate corners. 
---
They also take up way to much space in the build limit.
---
And please give the smaller generators (not the big ass fusion reactor) a better output. Although I love the look of those windmills, they also take up way too much build limit and are a nightmare to place on anything else but soil.
---
(You can put it on an arm and keep the chest slot open)
---
I like trying to make a clean place in the wasteland, to me it feels like you're trying to get back to the way things were.
---
If you shop around you’ll find some deals since flux is kinda heavy in stash’s. I’ve found a few selling for 100 and buy them. In return I also buy a bunch of other stuff when players have good prices!
---
Forgot to add standard
---
We will hold a bunch. We have s full set of Unstobbales. If you remember or get the chance to check, let us know. Not many have stepped forward so everything lusted above is available right now.
---
Getting on later than expected sorry, 30 minutes
---
Ps4
---
I’d really like this instead of needing to do the pillar glitch to stack two of those premade stair things so I can have a third floor. 
---
Also the metal grate floor clashes horrifically with the rest of my interior.
---
I understand what you mean. I mean I have makeshift and gunsmith maxed for crafting but I have also level 3's of each I run constantly for durability just so I can run other perks. 
---
BUT getting a hard bargain card after maxing it out just makes switching that much more of a chore.
---
On PC it's anywere from 250 to 100
---
Sorry I forgot to say its for ps4, there many bugs going on and after the update I was unable to make the ammo on ps4
---
have read about 2 a few times, never seen it in 2k + hours, would have loved to be there :)
---
I mean you are spending your time complaint to me about the way that I complain about a game.  If anything, you should be disgusted with yourself.
---
Also, a career and life are entirely separate things, and therefore should really not be brought up in this discussion. Things that don’t matter (like a video-game), I bitch about.  Things that matter (things in real life), I take action to resolve.
---
The level 76 glowing one out the back of Dolly Sods gets me every time 😖
---
I dunno if it's just me, but the Achievement Tracker doesn't actually track any of the "perform X a Y amount of times" each time they're done. So Code Cruncher is still at 0%, even though I have hacked plenty of terminals.
---
I can see this is going nowhere. Good luck.
---
Think AA counts as god tier. It's probably the best all around prefix for players with no particular build. Beats out two shot by few % and dosent have that awful accuracy.
---
I do neglect hacking a bit. Thank you, very cool
---
I charge based on rarity/difficulty so cobalt is 125 violet is 150 and rest 100
---
They last long enough to make it to the meat cook, but you can't save it for hours.

Some guy watching me shit: “can you hurry it up?”

Getting blue screened during a nuke you launched then can’t go straight back to that server!UUUGGGHHHH

Amen!

allright, Ryzen 7 2700x with B450 MB here
---
I found the C-state setting, but no cpu dram phase. I googled for the AMD equivalent APS (?) but found that nowhere in my UEFI BIOS. But i saw that "Cool N quiet" was on for some reason. This setting has been notorious for causing performance issues for years now so i turned that off. Also assigned 8 cores to the F76 process as the OP recommended.
---
**TLDR** it didnt "fix" but it "helped". Before, when i shot an average Scrochbeast with a TSE minigun and Strangler Heart PA, i had freezes almost 100% of times. Some of them resolved after waiting for minutes, sometimes i had to CTD. Biggest impact imo had the assigning 8 cores step.
---
Now i have frequent stutters and a 1-2 second freeze here and there and sometimes a complete freeze (with CTD).
---
While I m happy that we narrowed down what the issue is, i m still staying the hell away from Scorched Earth or any other Endgame-Event until this is fixed. For now this is a band-aid with a lot of holes in it (for me at least).
---
oh they do? sweet I could find like no info on how long they last
---
I can appreciate this post, just not the title. All great ideas.
---
No, they’ll take up the whole floor, if you have them off to one side, they only take up half. Same size stairs, but they won’t be an obstruction
---
Platform?
---
XB1
---
I KNOW RIGHT!? It’s kinda nuts, I’d like my privacy when the stairs are half the second floor in my 2x2x2 house
---
Fucking PLEASE Bethesda don't ignore or forget this!
---
There are alot of quality of life improvements sure, but the frame rate has worsened alot since beta! It's become a little too difficult to play comfortably!
---
I'll stand on your porch and lob mini nukes at it.
---
I did this very thing yesterday and broke both of it's legs. Are there more practical ways to break legs... Maybe but zero of them inclued a mini nuke.
---
Hey man, I mean there IS a (1/50)^3 chance that all 3 of those shots missed! ;)
---
Lol but yeah, that shit is annoying.
---
I wish I could help ya, but I could lose all of my stuff so I can't 😥
---
bad bot
---
You can shoot enemies multiple times and still not get any loot, say if it has a huge health pool like the SBQ, the Sheep Squash or the Imposter, heck I've had friends who couldn't loot sentry bots after I killed it! They definitely shot at it, I saw them unload a whole clip!
---
I definitely wished building in 76 wasn't less sensicle than it was in 4
---
This is correct but not coming to next year
---
Yeah, like 4 months from now...
---
I'd be happy with ammo exchange at those useless vending machines but I'd love this.
---
i only wear mine for nukezones, meltdown, and lucky hole mine.  i do carry it for a shield though at times
---
Maybe (hopefully) some quality of life updates will come in the future with the wastelanders update!
---
It is not a thing, and you can't trade here.
---
At what point did you read me write the word “like”? And you can’t get an accurate read on an open world game anything under 20 hours(IMO) and the only real reason I stuck through it that long was cuz the friends I played with. We’ve all moved on to other things, dropping off one by one with each “patch” and “hotfix” I was a believer in them just making this a Borderlands style 4 player co-op instead of what it is now.
---
Yep. You have a chance to get a duplicate when crafting.
---
Your display items stay in your stash when your CAMP doesn't load in so, how did you scrap them? Were you bulking junk? I had a problem where I bulked all my acid while trying to save up bloatfly glands for my syringer and this was the cause.
---
Yes. It is a thing.  And so are you and a world of other people are looking for it. It is the new unicorn....
---
Ugh. No. Not by nature. Don't make claims about human nature that you don't understand.
---
5mm or mini nukes.. A man of culture I see.
---
LMAO
---
Yes, but when you're running around through an area, you're not running AND looking at your map so it's a lovely surprise to see someone's camp appear through the trees.
---
PS:  Also not everyone has a vendor set up so not EVERYONE'S CAMPs are shown on the map.  lol
---
it is a thing, but as the other user said you would be better off on the trade sub, id hit up mark. et. 76. (put it all 1 word in the search bar, mods blocked us from linking it)

happy hunting

As far as I can tell, it works. My Zealot's prime gatling plasma kept up with my old Furious pretty well, and when I added a prime receiver, it just started ripping them to shreds.

*Three Hundred Hours*
---
Don't use them all up at the same time. Wait a few hours in between and only do 2 or 3. She may give stuff out on different rng wheels at different times. I know Destiny does that shit in the background loot mechanics
---
It is a thing, I have one and it's one of the best rifle weapons I've ever used, the only thing I would give mine up for is one that is explosive
---
That sounds like a massive waste of your time.
---
Heck the system from Fallout 1 was better!
---
Lol I usually don’t get mad during play but the fast travel and crafting benches pull back make me scream.
---
Oh wait. You mean the quest item? I think it's craftable with a recipe you get from Fort Defiance.
---
Snallygaster skyrim horsies instead?
---
I figure if the first 20 hours aren't fun, enjoyable, entertaining, provocative etc, it's a badly designed game and it's not worth investing so much time in.
---
A quest line could be awesome, maybe you find “the responders university” where they train their volunteers and merchants ect.
---
Is there a plan for the red firework? I finally got the red firework today, but I thought last Meat Week someone said there was a plan for it.
---
Yes please!!!
---
I love this idea! I’m not a fan of vendors.
---
I agree. Like i traded Q/25/25 handmade for a laser rifle and some nuka colas... Why? Cause thats what I wanted. Think the higest ever sold anything was 11k for a knife. Im not going to use it so have fun dude.
---
Are you ps4 or xbox?
---
B3 is lowest common denominator though. Virtually Everyone is going to pick it up.
---
Somebody has to pack the heat
---
Thanks for giving a reference and not just being a smarmy douche :)
---
It will just take one person to test the custom name to Jack Meoff or something like that to cancel the whole deal...lol
---
Imo the game is great fun while your doing main and side quests, it’s also fun &lt; 50 and maybe until lvl 70 or something.
---
After that it’s boring, because there’s nothing left interesting to do and events are very confusing and not fun.
---
Endgame is the real wasteland.
---
Just wait around when the fast travel bug happens. Take a piss or whatever. Since I've been waiting It always pops up eventually. It's a chance to get your loot back.
---
Fixers were added to the legendary vendor loot pool.
---
Nope, Everybody was hoping they would add plans for the firework and tenderizer this time. Nothing has changed it seems.
---
I gave up on the game ages ago after all my friends dropped out from all the bugs, I decided to install it recently after E3 because I thought they might have fixed the game up a bit, somehow it seems like there are MORE bugs than before.
---
My plan was to convince my mates to come back but that's not going to happen in the games current state.
---
I have a assassin one. It's bada***  Rivals my bloodied faster fire rate handmade.
---
I really want to see a bloodied one.
---
They would still be an obstruction because they would still take up half the space. No matter how you cut it it will take up half a foundation space.
---
fuck im slipping, i need to start getting meaner since people apparently like to call me a douche. (not you, others lol)
---
if it helps its under the design category near the bottom of that section.  (incase you dont believe me and do check)
---
YOU DON'T NEED DRUMS.
---
Its kind of obvious though.
---
Gutsy: You shoot like a girl
---
Me, a girl: I'm not even using a gun

Anything but drums please, unless it's a full meat cook.
---
This is reflecting the actual life n death scenario in real life
---
I'm at 550. Sure I've been frustrated at times, but I've had way more good experiences than bad experiences.
---
But it seems so obvious in how it works to me... I don't get the confusion, seriously.
---
I let him die for a reason.
---
They said the presige will be every 50 levels and retroactive when implemented. You have no worries. Lecel up play and when we can prestige you'll have an instant bank of them saved up.
---
Imagine complaining that you only enjoyed ANYTHING for 300 hours.
---
Camps that are actually floating with no supports are cool
---
I figure anyone who believes the BS and stays away are exactly the types of people I don't want to play with. I like people who make up their own mind and don't follow the herd.
---
And yet you've played for 1000 hours ...?
---
*laughs in raid armor*
---
r/endthecirclejerk
---
Yea that too
---
Uh good for you?
---
Oh I was talking about clicking on a location to travel to and it kicks it back out not sending you there. Sometimes doing that 4-5 times till it finally sends you.
---
That'd be really awesome. But, knowing how Bethesda takes some of the suggestions on here, they'll probably take this idea and sell special tv show bundles for 1000 atoms in the atomic shop.
---
I don't know, man. I think this is just the way games are heading. The cost of production keeps rising and the only way to make money on a game is either a higher base price or subsequent transactions. And since many people just wait for the price of a game to drop before they but it, studios are almost guaranteed to go for the latter.
---
MODUS
---
Haven't scrapped my robot models since I put them in the case, and the game tried to scrap them first before I displayed them.
---
Just luck. I've gotten only 1 Salty plan this time around so far, which is the last plan I needed on my second character anyway.  But gotten a few of the Tenderizers which I modded and put up for sale.
---
That's all I've been doing...Im lvl 277...and...I need a change up. Was hoping this would come in soon and give me something decent to do until wastelanders. Now...well...I'm really not wanting to play as much anymore. It's tiring lol
---
I think this is the better alternative. There are no effect rolls in runescape, and having a GE like trading system would be harder to implement effectively. There are so many different ways to tackle the problem of unique weapon drops in the GE system that i think something like ESO, where weapons can be made with different effects too, is a much better plug and play alternative to creating their own system. The GE in runescape is so good because there is no variation within each individual item. A zammy spear is a Zammy spear, but a 'handmade' encompasses 1000s of variations, from legendary effects, to mods equipped, and weapon level. The ESO system works so well in that game because it has variation within each specific weapon or armor, similar to F76. The Maplestory Auction House/MTS are also a good foundation to start from.
---
i mean, at least im not sitting here circlejerking a bug that happened a handful of times, that was near impossible to reproduce, had specific and easy to avoid set of circumstances, and was worked on in patch 13, with no recorded instances post patch.
---
but fapfapfap i guess
---
Sure fired way to get tier 3 meat-cook: Kill critters and turn them in at the greens and chunks tent.
---
The struts should cost no budget or even be placed automatically.
---
imo the game is worse than it was at launch
---
there is far less to do, fewer active events, fewer legendary enemies and in turn loot, nukes were far more rewarding a year ago
---
the end game used to be nuked whitesprings, now its just broken, but hey miles ahead right, idk how you can type that out and not laugh at it
---
the atmosphere is good, post apocalyptic exploration, but everything else is garbage
---
purveyor, the only good thing added, but that really isn't content
---
Damn dude calm the fuck down. I kept hearing that people were losing their stuff so I was scared to go back in. Heaven fucking forbid someone is nervous about losing their stuff. (Also I didn't know about the patch, I forget to read patch notes)
---
I used to run his event all the time with minimal issues - yesterday I turned around for a half second to deal with one feral that was clawing at my back, and five or six other ghouls came outta nowhere and dropped him in an instant. Kind of oof.
---
I also get those days. I think the only thing that keeps me going is I don't have much free time. I can do everything I need to in an hour. Which is perfect because I don't have the proper time to put into a new game right now.
---
Might be one of the few times it’s worth it.
---
The lag / stutter is my major issue with the game.
---
What's that, you pressed reload? Naaaah I spazzed out for a moment. You must have been holding the button for those 3 seconds. I'll put your gun away during this fight.
---
Oh look. A Yao Guia. You're shooting it, good. It's nearly dead and just in t......................ime.
---
Ah! Now you're half dead, what are you doing?!
---
Let's sell stuff to this vendor. All that bulked leather and stuff. Scrolling down. You want to sell th.............is two shot explosive rifle? And I've confirmed it? Done! You want it back? Ok that's 700 caps.
---
If it’s green it should be placeable. No more of “this item is floating” nonsense when it isn’t even floating. And also I’m tired of my stuff getting placed on the floor above me when I use stairs
---
Less armor cost
---
3 manned it, thanks though😁
---
Why would you put so much time into a game that you didn't like? Twenty hours is way more time than what's needed to know if you didn't like a game, let alone 300. Saying it was because friends were playing all you want, my friends couldn't pay me to play a game I didn't like.
---
It's just easier to say "I played it for a while, decided I didn't like it".
---
Fallout or physics. Choose one.
---
*gutsy pulls a two shot expirimental mirv from thin air*
---
Yea around patch ten or so when they changed PvP damage and map markers its really gone down hill for me. Hoping theyre new patch will balance things better. So yea 1000 hours and theyre patches make it worse, yep
---
Oh shit 😂
---
So take a break. Play something else for a while.
---
It just works

Wow only 300 hours of gameplay smh what a trash game
---
With all due respect, get a fucking life.
---
Probably bought from a vendor.  Can't bulk them that I know of
---
Agree. One of my favorite things to do in this game is build my home. I run out of budget before I run out of ideas. Stairs fit stupidly. I use excess materials to try and make them work logically. There are half floors but no vertical half walls. Steel foundation posts aren’t long enough. And so on.  Super mutants and scorched get suspended bridges and ladders but I don’t?  I say nay! For the love of Appalachia let us build!
---
Other games have "naughty name" filters (some ridiculously strict). And other players are report happy.
---
But they'll cost 10 script each for the first 150 points if scrip you gain that day.
---
RNG could also be server-linked, so I usually only go by the purveyor if I notice I'm getting the "rare" rewards from certain events, like Imposter Sheepsquatch clothing or a Tenderizer.

Why not both? I’m a level 52 with an AAE Handmade who popped scorched enemies and took about a quarter of the SBQ’s Health in a battle last weekend. 
---
When I was Level 43, I helped take down an SBQ with two other high levels using a Quad double-barrel with an anti-scorched receiver. I took the last third of her health solo (about 800 rounds) when the other two guys fast-traveled to Watoga Station, presumably to re-stock or rearrange their inventory. I stayed under her abdomen, shooting up at her - no other scorched enemies approached (don’t know why, but I was pretty happy with that). Kept repairing the shotgun with repair kits to keep up a steady flow of fire. 
---
I’m not spec’d for PvP, but I am prepared for PvE. I’m sure other below Level 50 players could be useful combatants as well.
---
This is the real issue. I've covered it with posters, but from the other side they are invisible! Need half width and height walls please!
---
You cant bulk them so that was someone's loot bag. The only way you get bulk screws is from robot vendors.
---
Games need some comedy relief... I’m totally good with it...lol
---
Someone nuked Harper's Ferry on PS4? I've never seem that. Nearly always the nuke zones are down in the bog when I'm online.  Used to be more around Whitesprings but that seems to happen rarely now.
---
I'm not here to agree or disagree.  I only 2ant to inform you that this topic has been discussed already.  just scroll down here and on r\f076
---
not f/076 but  r/fo76filthycasuals
---
They're one of the items you can't bulk yourself, like ballistic fiber and crystal. They're only sold like that from the NPC vendors.
---
Me too.
---
Yes, technically you’re right but you’re taking it too literally. Moving it to one side gives 1/2 the space to walk, etc, than the current 1/4 space, stair, 1/4 space as is the current setup. Or maybe it’s thirds. Anywho, 1/2 to 2/3 walking space is still better (depending on build desires) than 1/4 to 1/3. There should be more snapping in options. AND THEN WE WILL BE SATISFIED! 
---
(J/K We are never satisfied)

Also the greens, those plants add a lot

Damn, on PS4. 
---
Enjoy your weekend!
---
It was a limited time atom shop item they brought in when they introduced the arktos pharma event. Hopefully they bring it back for Halloween but I don't think there's been anything official said about it returning.
---
Maybe both? That way at high or low health you get the resistances bonus? If you cant run both then run whatever fits your arsenal better. If you use bloodied weapons then bolstering is the obvious choice.
---
No use in supporting a mode nobody played.  Even when it was new i rarely found a full server.
---
okay, i hope they bring it back for a little bit
---
I have weapons for both that’s why I was wondering which of the two would be better, I have a bloodied/AAE two shot and a vampire .50 cal to use
---
He just needs robobrain treads, or assaultron legs. he'd be so much quicker.
---
That's the difference between us. I'm house bound so its actually the only thing I have to keep my mind occupied.  Noones fault...just was hoping to keep on keeping on..
---
Bummer that sucks I can imagine you get quite bored.
---
Alright, I'll check tomorrow. Thank you!
---
Hi not too familiar with dad.
---
I can't...I find it hatd to get to grips with other games, been playing fallout since my illness in 2016 and...other games have no interest fir me sadly. I wish I could...I really do
---
My advice is experiment then. Any build can be beat and has a counter so it's best to experiment and build off of how you play. 
---
One is not better than the other despite what others may say, it just depends on how you play.
---
Hell....yeah...
---
Yes still rare. I’ve done it many, many, many times... couple of tenderizers, but no mods or plans for them. :(
---
The sliding ghouls are a pain, but only occur if you fast travel to the cell. It's safer to fast travel to the station or watch tower nearby and run the test of the way.
---
You too
---
Happy cake day!
---
Very helpful thank you I’ll give that a try ! 🙏🏻
---
Thanks
---
I am confused if you are talking about adding this in the game or the reddit? If the game, I don't know why the character names are not displayed in the first place. I can see an argument that they wanted the user name displayed to accountability. Someone couldn't just hop on another character and keep doing bad things without anyone knowing. But they could have done that as a sub text or by inspecting characters and let the character names picked show. Or something like other games do character name@user name.
---
As far as I can tell it makes no difference what you pick for your characters name since only you will see them. And it rings false against their idea of having players act as other factions would when someone's Responder member, Brotherhood and Raider characters all have the name DankMemes420....
---
First you have to offer yourself to the wasteland and come back as a Vendor bot. From there you must have the caps (dont worry if you run out your bag of 1400 will refill in 20 hours) to buy screws off of somebody selling them. When no one else is looking you then snack on them like your favorite chip. Tickle your belly button is next, and very important! When you feel a resistance in your stomach like a capacitor is going bad dont worry that's just your flux capacitor converting the screws to bulk. Next time your pipes need venting out will come a fresh box of bulk screws which you can sell to wastelander who stop by for a ridiculous amount.
---
I mean you test something out and if it’s not working you kill it. That’s why test and learn is all about lol.
---
Nope, I don't usually bulk. It would have been ammo crafting or making marine tactical masks, repairing, etc.
---
No the stuff doesn't load in the case since there is no case but it still shows in your inventory in your stash and is available to junk. I realized pretty quickly that was happening and kept an eye on the materials list when crafting... but the issue now is it seems not everything comes up when you're looking at that list to warn you. For example, if you have those chess pieces from the one frat house, they come up named "bishop", "queen", etc when you go to make ammo and it's going to scrap them for the steel. Somewhere along the line though, during a repair or crafting something, a bunch of them scrapped without warning me, only displaying that I had enough steel for the repair or whatever. It wasn't until a few days later that I even noticed. My husband had this happen with a display he had with scorched jar body parts (he did something Halloween themed) a few times and he's usually OCD about reading those material lists to make sure he isn't scrapping anything.
---
What’s a budgit?
---
I knew I forgot something.
---
Filthy casuals ...
---
I don't mind them. Let people build what they want.
---
I think your on to something about the spots losing effectiveness. Its pings out a bunch when you start then slows down. This matches up with how grahm talks about your arms getting tired. Btw DONT FORGET TO FEED CHALLEY
---
I love the game
---
You can buy mods for the Scout Armor from Modus, but there are no plans. 
---
With the latest patch, the mods from Modus are labeled better, so you’ll have a better idea of what you’re purchasing.
---
No. Nor do mod plans. You can buy non legendary from MODUS, they drop legendary, and you can only buy the mod boxes from MODUS.
---
Thanks homie
---
Shoot faster?
---
Nobody is one shotting anything unless it's in the forest or maybe toxic valley. And if you can't shoot it before some melee guy gets there, I can't help you.
---
You can still use the events to level. You get exp for completing it and the faster that goes the faster you can get back.
---
I'm not going to fail because you cant shoot fast enough... Sorry.
---
There are two Royal Jellys, the junk one which is useless and the aid one which is used to make taffy. I think you can get both from honey beasts but the aid one is very rare. If you need the aid one then tanagra town and middle mountain cabins have a spawn point.
---
And yet we still fail the cranberry bog one because people think standing on the pole and trying to kill things they can't hit is helping and waste time.
---
Nope, not sorry about going out and killing things so we can get it done.
---
No need to be snobby towards other people. Don't like it that much, switch servers. I don't get why this bothers people?
---
I have a standard brick house in the forest which does not float, cus I personally would be bugged by that. But if others want to, then who am I to say otherwise?
---
How many characters?
---
I'm 217. And 195. And 143. And 130.
---
Maybe try a different build?
---
Hmmm, I didn't know if stored junk ever popped up with a scrap confirmation. I thought it only did that for junk that had another purpose like the mole rat teeth or Sheepsqautch bones. It certainly doesn't for bloatfly glands when you're bulking. Maybe ammo is different.
---
No, unless you're camp is in a really obvious position please just use a switch. Spending 30 or 40 caps to visit a vending machine you can't use because the owner has walled it off but left their fast travel icon on is annoying as hell
---
I hate it. There is no half floors really neither. I just always fall to the downstairs instead of use the stairs by accident.
---
I just use a third party app for my crosshair. That way I can still aim when my weapons recoil or jumping throws my in game dot sight all over the screen.
---
Stairs should NOT be an atom shop exclusive anyway. That's a damn joke. That's worse then the fridge imo.
---
Rimworld. Will suck time away. Really good
---
Just one...its enough lol. I already forget to switch out perks and I worked hard to get the weapons and armour I have. The thought of doing it all over again...it's a bit much for me. Goid on you though.  You've done well with yours.
---
I'm on a low budget..new games are a no. I still have the 2 newer  Wolfenstien and Dishonoured to play but...again...i can't get to grips with another style of play. My bad. Noone elses.
---
This actually fixed my issue. I rebuilt my terminal. Logged out. Came back and the quest disappeared from my quest list. 
---
Restarted it via the terminal and bam. Camera. 
---
Thank you so much.
---
Maybe. It’s a pretty solid connection otherwise. I’m sure it’s not the game design. I’m just venting
---
I did mean in game. Thank you for a good response.
---
Pvp - full health 
---
Pve - bloodied
---
I hope so! They have been adressing a lot of QoL issues, so hopefully Camps will be next.
---
The tesla rifle helps a ton with this event
---
And while you’re at it, can you also make it so recipes that require boiled water can also use purified water? Makes no sense that if I have 30 purified waters on me that I then have to collect dirty water to make boiled water to cook or make into booze.
---
Its not just you, tonight the nuke was launched, I traveled. I got ready, took my meds and right as it fell...game crashed and that was that... Thanks so much, bend over players here it comes again!
---
No way! Youre telling me this is the day i set up my reddit !?
---
How does that boot taste?
---
4 years ago today ☺️
---
Trevor Phillips is cslling from 2013
---
I mean that’s the hardest Prime Meat event so I would and should expect some people to not be able to kill as quick you want. Welcome to online multiplayer games. 
---
I would retort would more gusto but there’s nothing to say.
---
So long and thanks for all the fish 👋
---
I can attest. I put quite a few shots into her with prime gauss other day, then went to work on adds... no drop..
---
What about the so from vault 51?
---
Dude thats so awesome thank you
---
When u do the quest to build escavator PA after u have it built then u register it you will get the plan from the quest
---
check out r/fo76filthycasuals
---
I remember my first camp was 4 foundations with workbenches right before flatwoods for ease of access, and every time I logged on and tried to replace the foundations I got item is floating errors bc when it stored the foundations and workbenches it thought they all needed eachother for support, making them unplacable.
---
I'm actually unsure. It was a junk item I picked up a few nights ago and accidentally scrapped before I could look at it closer. It appeared to look like an Military Grade Circut board but differently shaped. More rounded.
---
Please do tell. I'd like to know also.
---
There were helmets recallled due to mould, is it the same ones?
---
it's Boon's dad, The Gunny himself!
---
No those were the nuka cola helmet's
---
Isn't everyone using Teslas though?
---
hit the right trigger
---
Let the people with old facts continue making fools of themselves. They clearly haven’t and will ever play the game because they’re part of the hive mind of hate band wagoners.
---
Still though, there is no justifying that 90% of content being put into the game is behind micro transactions. Yes they’re a business but would it kill them to put a few outfits into the game for free, especially ones that look as cool as the atomic shop ones? I mean from a business standpoint, it’d boost player engagement which is also as equally beneficial.
---
What about fallout mods that remake the games?
---
Oh ok
---
Take me demon, I'm the one you want.
---
Bind meelee into 3 cards so u can have max shotgun max heavy gunner and max meelee and two handed under strengh all on at once instead of alwase having to change crads
---
Change name on Bethesda website.
---
Your post comes off as saying low level characters don't deserve to fight or loot the boss, and if they do show up, fight the other things for us. I generally work crowd control and revive other players, which I have been doing since level 40 or so. I am getting tired of getting yelled at over area chat about my dps, or some ass making fun of everyone else there because of his bloodied build doing all the damage. Let people play how they want, and don't think everyone else has to be your bodyguards because you run a low health build.
---
PS: I'm sorry if I am coming off like a bitch, but I have been dealing with a bunch of toxic players this week and my nerves are fried.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
Yeah, she's got a fun personality and I really enjoyed her quests. No radiant quests from her makes the divide feel less interesting
---
The reason they aren't increasing camp budgets is probably for server stability.
---
WOW had this in their app.  I played the AH more than the game some weeks.
---
I totally agree
---
I kinda figured
---
I've seen it about as often as whitesprings on pc. Lots of enemies, but far less plants.
---
for a little while yeah but just like other ah markets things don't stay that way
---
Yes there is
---
So bummed... It was fun while it lasted.
---
It's a scorched queen drop I literally just got it today
---
It just works.
---
I've replayed fo4 with mods. I'm on Xbox so not sure what's available as they tend to be pc based
---
Improved AP refresh
---
Following this... I have two pieces of BOS powered and I’m wondering what the word “powered” means when stats seem the same??
---
Signed.
---
But to be honest the loot SBQ drops is pathetic. Only good for scrips.
---
I have had that happen with other events if I join immediately after logging in.  Now I make sure to wait a minute or two before joining.
---
Yeah, but I was already in the server for well over an hour and already did the event once.
---
For most people. But she can drop good entry level legendary stuff. You’ll outclass it quickly. But it’s the principle of the fact.
---
I want ELEVATORS back.
---
If you are on PC I can make a Fixer for you. Not Legendary, of course, but it would let you try out the Stealthiness?
---
Oh then I have no idea.  If it does it again (no event notification) FT away and back.
---
Have you compared to non powered?
---
The 🎂 cake is a lie.
---
There is a jetpack mod for the ultracite armor
---
I try to hop, then it does that “your camp cannot be placed” thing for 5 servers
---
It’s rare? I just got it. Considering I got four hats just before that, I guess I deserved it.
---
Can you?
---
When I was learning radium mods I used a fully unyielding set at low health (20%) took berry Mentats, intelligence bobblehead, drank something with +I, and ate something with +I. Even with all that and having around 30-35 intelligence I still had to scrap probably 500 radium rifles to get all the mods.
---
My favorite flavor
---
I submit.  When you figure it out please update thnx
---
I'm curious too, monitoring this thread
---
How do you power it? Or is it a perk?
---
Hee!
---
Nope. Legendary modifier.
---
It's just a legendary effect. It literally just speeds up your AP regeneration. If you wanna be literal, the armor is powering *you*.
---
I would take Sundays up in the offer for a Fixer. I've been testing just a regular that I crafted earlier in the week. I'm not a sneak build at all, but hit damn does that gun work!
---
&gt; I can only put them on this particular spot at any orientation imaginable other than the one I want
---
I feel this in my soul.
---
No worries
---
Ok, sorry I was gone for a while. As for the crossbows, yes, FFR will make the QUAD crossbow fire faster. Why? Because the normal, non-quad crossbow only loads one bolt in it's "clip" at a time, UNLESS it's a QUAD, which loads 4x the ammo per weapon clip, and can fire 4 times before reload. So now it has a clip of multiple shots, which can benefit from FFR. This is why FFR has no effect on weapons that only fire one shot per reload. Those weapons benefit from RELOAD speed, but not FFR. Unless you find a Quad version, which then allows FFR to work. And then there are things with a charge mechanic like the Gauss rifle I mentioned that don't work with fire rate because FFR doesn't speed up the charge mechanic. Also, BP rifles and Explosive-type weapons cannot drop with the Quad Legendary effect. Hope you understood that!
---
A word of caution, here: A lot of one-shot guns don't work right with Quad/FFR, or just FFR in general. They can have recoil SO bad they are unusable outside of VATS. The Railway Rifle with the Automatic mod and FFR will have you staring at the sky with one pull of the trigger, for instance. The devs didn't seem to imagine what some of these Legendary effect combinations would do to certain weapons. Ask to test unfamiliar FFR guns out before a trade, or have a trusted third party that you and your trade partner both agree to let hold and test both trade items and caps for you during a transaction. Don't get hosed!
---
As for a movement speed cap...I have no idea whatsoever. Haha. Never heard of one, though.
---
lol it’s not my claim, I’m not old enough to figure that out myself, but it fits my observations.
---
Why I aughta
---
Oh,yeah. Bummer.
---
Yea
---
honestly i couldnt care less ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Based on my anecdotal experience (I also stack a lot of stealthiness) it didn't seem to matter. Nothing really saw me before, and nothing really saw me when I used it.
---
That's not exactly scientific, but I guess I'm saying don't empty your bank trying to get one.
---
There should have been an empty frame in the same room.  You should also get the plans,  When you try to build each piece, it will tell you what components you havem what you need. 
---
 you then have to get the appropriate materials, build the pieces, then return and register the helmet.
---
If there is not an empty frame in the room, you can get one at any of the PA spawns across the map,  or you can use a frame you already have.
---
Black titanium can be had by killing mole miners and scrapping their suits.  Some deathclaws also give black titanium as loot.
---
Screws and suck are often found near workbenches,
---
I honestly thought it was just RNG, would love to find out there's a stat I can boost to make it easier.
---
Nice story painting a picture of what this man is.....he prejudge people without even talking to them.  He hurls insults and besmirch peoples good names.  He is what he claims to hate. 
---
Also.... He holds information over the whereabouts of Mic and refuses to answer any questions or help look for this missing person.
---
Sinseerly.....sincerely meh I've heard it both ways help us find Mic and bring him home safe.
---
(Hes not dead under a foundation snow ffs)
---
Thanks for offering the idea though. Always appreciated.
---
AA is only good for low-damage weapons. Once you add all the damage boosting, and anti-armor, perks and weapon attachments, especially with melees, it is possible to reach a point where AA literally becomes useless because it adds no damage since the NPC with the most damage resistance is the SBQ with 300. Play around with the F76 damage calculator and you'll see: [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)
---
Even an explosive LMG with the prime receiver can reach this point when using all damage boosts (including Revenant, Adrenaline, Strange in Numbers, and sneak bonuses).
---
Intelligence
---
“Aren’t bound by the laws of physics” game has a exploding mini gun, alien blasters, literally has a weapon that goes on your shoulders that fires nukes ten feet In Front of you hmmmm.
---
Happens sometimes in events. I fast travel again and it clicks. Does this when i try to walk in to fort defiance quest.
---
I'm not sure 500 scraps to get all the mods qualifies as "the way", but it's valuable info!
---
If you find a frame with pieces higher than your level, you go into the inventory and remove them. Once you do that, you can collect the frame for your use. Warning get rid of the higher level pieces as they add a lot of weight when not on a frame.
---
There has to be like 2 or 3 players on each platform who know all those mods. I pay a guy.
---
I’m just wondering what makes it different... maybe not better but not sure what “powered” indicates like bolstering and other prefixes...
---
Go try radiums and get back with me lol. Higher intelligence does mean a higher chance to learn mods. 
---
My ALT who is mainly a bloodied build has learned armor and weapon mods much faster because of the higher intelligence from the few piece of unyielding on her. My main knows everything though simply from playing and utilizing the unyielding set for harder to learn mods like the radium, which I wont be learning on my ALT.
---
Hmm, maybe I shouldn't of thrown my 8-tracks away.
---
Still faster movment speed and sneak dmg so still worth it
---
I don't like gravity defying CAMPs but I understand why people build them.
---
People use rubber bands or something else to keep their camera spinning on console
---
I don't like gravity defying CAMPs either, but I understand why people build them.
---
Yea, there is probably a few more but it is a pain. I dont advertise it, I have learned everything to fill my completionist itch and to help my buddies out.
---
The button you use to bash with your gun is used for power attacks with melee weapons.
---
Maybe. Levels aren't like money or power though; by gaining more levels you're not taking any levels from anyone else. A level 300+ could be as harmless to the other players as a level 5 if they wanted to be.
---
That’s what I’m told, I get a lot of tesla users and they always say the best way to counter them is vanguard
---
Bloodied plus unyelding plus food plus multipliers. Completely unnecessary but some people want to see how hard they can hit.
---
750??? Most sell for like 250-300... if you’re on Xbox I have plenty...
---
That’s what I’ve been doing but my controller turns off for some reason
---
I got one for 275 on pc
---
Yeah idk, personally I haven't done it
---
Its a known... problem.  Unsure if it will be fixed or not since I’m not aware Bethesda has commented on it.
---
Not sure about that one but I do know with the powerfist you hit the r/b instead of r/t.you can only do it once and it knocks your AP out big time then it's back to regular punches but it recovers quick.
---
Yeah I didn't know what it was worth, honestly been away from the game for a while but getting back into it. Saw this and wanted to be like Mike ha yeah I'm on Xbox GT is Kreech300, when will you be on
---
Beth has acknowledged this issue and stated that they are working on it. So most like the next patch should fix it
---
That sucks. I put in a ticket about it to try and get my 500 Atoms back since it won't work on my gun. Hopefully I will get some sort of response
---
Best bet is checking around power towers if you can stand that aesthetic.
---
But a level 300 is going to have way more money and stuff than a level 5. You get the analogy, right? If you're comparing workshops to the means of production, a level 300 is much more a powerful person than a level 5...
---
As others have said get your intelligence as high as you can. I have a unyielding set just for this and I am not a bloody build.
---
Yeah ive just built up a full set of vanguard took a while, still need a left arm tho since mines is a 2*. High energy resist eats the tesla tho
---
Ok cool. I have a full set of unyielding just for cases like this. Also berry mentats etc. I'll stick some food in my fridge that boosts Intelligence and keep on the lookout for bobbleheads. Then, once I find a thousand or so goddam screws I'll do a big build and scrap-a-thon and hope for the best. 
---
Thanks for the confirmation!
---
&gt;He’s like my drunken friend who starts a fight in the kebab shop every Friday night. He’s all mouth and has no intention of fighting but he picks on the biggest guy there and leaves the rest of us brawlin while he calmly slips away into a taxi while shoving a doner kebab into his mouth.
---
See this is the part we all need to be paying more attention to here
---
Naw
---
What system? I have it on PC, cheap.
---
I do get what you're saying and I think with any high level who abuses that power you're absolutely correct.
---
Plug in a charger to the controller so it doesn’t die..
---
Edit: no matter what afk style you follow, you will always seem like an ass
---
What region are you in? Without survival servers we will have to account for greater lag if you are on a different region than our own.
---
I get that too sometimes, check the volume for voice in the game menu.  But I think some of the tapes are really hard to hear unless you're in a very quite place of the game.
---
Thanks I'll try that if it happens again
---
I like her when I'm working on her quest but I have my camp near there so annoying when I log on or fast travel home and hear her
---
Mole miner gauntlet does not work with PA
---
NA
---
It's usually for portability reasons or possibly a quick temporary camp. I did this in my early levels and no I wasn't happy with it. 
---
Now that I have endless resources, every camp I build becomes more and more elaborate. I still wish I could have a second temporary camp of sorts, even if it's just a large tent or the travel trailer just to move around at will. When you spend hours building your camp, you don't move it, and I think we all know why.
---
There are two ways to do a Power Attack:
---
1. You press the same button you use to bash, or hold to throw a grenade.
---
2. You are sprinting toward an enemy when you attack them.
---
I mean, I’m trying to do it while on the drums so I’m at least contributing to the event
---
Or you could.. you know do the event
---
Powered has to do with AP refresh, good for melee or V.A.T.S builds. If you have powered on your armor it will regen you AP faster than if it didn't, not sure how much faster tho.
---
Not really. All you are doing is starting the event before anyone trying to do the event shows up.
---
Probably not
---
I used radium rifle because it is known that they are the hardest to get. Maybe it was a bad example but it beats others saying they had to do 1000. EDIT: I guess I use the example of radiums because even if you boost INT out the wazoo it doesnt mean it will be efficient. 
---
Intelligence is what mainly effects the mod learn chance. Luck is for condition of the weapons you find, the amount of ammo, etc. Either way a full u yielding set will boost both but since you cant stack different chems, different foods, drinks, or bobbleheads anymore focusing on 1 of each with INT boost is the best bet. 
---
Other weapons will not take nearly as long and dont forget that some things must be learned by plans, like dense for armor. 
---
Armor is also rather difficult and has a much lower learn chance than most weapons do.
---
Then he needs protection on the way back, but once he gets back all the doors close.
---
I'd probably play more if they had a central market.
---
Hearing her makes me want to commit supukku
---
Glad you're having fun! I'm on PC so I can't join you, but I hope you find some people in the wasteland to play with. :)
---
If you find a volunteer. Go to the fair grounds in the nw of the forest. By the water spawns level 1 scorched that will knock you down in the water without instadeath.
---
From the posts here it seems most people get one free “take back” on a purchase.  Good luck!
---
Also why can't we have the greenhouse set from Fallout 4? Its essentially just the warehouse set with windows
---
Weird is says it does? Guess Bethesda messed up the rules. Thanks for letting us know
---
&gt;As for the crossbows, yes, FFR will make the QUAD crossbow fire faster. Why? Because the normal, non-quad crossbow only loads one bolt in it's "clip" at a time, UNLESS it's a QUAD, which loads 4x the ammo per weapon clip, and can fire 4 times before reload. So now it has a clip of multiple shots, which can benefit from FFR.
---
This is logical but when I made this same point before, the other person told me I was wrong because he did tests. He was probably just bsing me.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;This is why FFR has no effect on weapons that only fire one shot per  reload like BP rifles and the like. Those weapons benefit from RELOAD  speed, but not FFR. Unless you find a Quad version, which then allows  FFR to work.
---
Okay I actually might be able to correct you here.
---
First, Quad versions or BPs don't exist to my knowledge.
---
Second, FFR is almost completely useless on BP guns but may potentially work in combination with the "quick hands" perk.
---
&gt;The Railway Rifle with the Automatic mod and FFR will have you staring  at the sky with one pull of the trigger, for instance. The devs didn't  seem to imagine what some of these Legendary effect combinations would  do to certain weapons.
---
For sure but it does that to me even without the FFR effect.
---
I actually think recoil on this gun works as intended though. It's an overpowered "VATS gun" by design. It has a considerably lower AP usage cost compared to other rifles. I believe the base version of automatic railway has the highest DPS in the game(compared to the base version of all other weapons.) It's possible the devs didn't want you using the gun outside of VATS for the sake pvp balancing.
---
I hope so. That skin looks awesome!
---
The only thing you can really do is fast travel again to the same event.  I feel like I've seen this more often since the Public Events system went live.
---
Note that one exception to this is Free Range.  With Free Range, the location of the event doesn't update until the Brahmin get a little past the halfway point.  It's typical to exit that event just before the Bloodbugs show up in the Savage Divide, and then magically re-enter it.
---
I think your thoughts on power are different than mine. Power doesn't just mean used against other people. Power is a measure of wealth, and ability. 
---
As an example, I have 160 stimpaks. My weapon can 1 shot a level 68 super mutant. My house has everything I need plus stuff to make it cute, in a location where it can't get attacked. 
---
A level 5 would LOVE to have 10 stimpaks. I have more power than the level 5. A level 5 probably has a half broken pipe pistol. And a funky wooden house in the middle of the forest getting attacked by anything that shambles by.
---
I believe it has more to do with individualism. Player thinking they do everything that there prize might be better. Yesterday I got the tenderizer and all I did was feed chally twice and got there after it started.
---
I'll have to recheck the patch release notes.. maybe they changed the way let's follow your camp...
---
Thank you.  Last I tried moving my camp nuclear winter didn't exist.
---
Not to mention those steel posts that snap to the center or 3/4 point of the side of floor pieces and not the corners???
---
Wastelanders is still otw so you could just wait until that update drops or hop back on to grind some legendaries &amp; hit up meat week before it’s done
---
?? That’s not how the event starts. It happens every hour and has 2 minutes of wait time.
---
I’m on now, GT: SaltClaw I’ll just give you one...
---
I can't really offer help, except to say that I also wish it was easier to quantify and compare the effects of these different things.
---
There's also Muffled on legs, Shrouded on Wood Armor, and the general "Become harder to detect while sneaking" perk on Legendary armor.
---
Can’t really do that at 3 am while I’m asleep
---
intersecting an existing object
---
did you mean the cliff I'm trying to build on top of??
---
And you normally get a legendary item from the event.
---
That is wierd, you wouldn't get banned for buying a duped item as 99% of players inventories are full of them. And its probably more common on console
---
There are two events. Either way, no one else enjoys afk in the lobby.
---
So go ahead and down vote comments to your own post
---
Sadly, I got one the first day they started dropping. I don't run bloodied, so I put it up for sale for 2500 caps, not realizing how wanted it might be. It lasted all of one customer who yelled "Holy F*ck!!!" over area chat and then started laughing.  :(  FML.
---
This game could learn **LITERALLY EVERYTHING** from Runescape. Seasonal events, pets, a working friends list...
---
That would be sick. I love the grognak game but never actually want to devote time to it in game
---
Then don’t? Lol I turn my system off when I sleep and I still have all of the plans. Seems rediculous to even bother doing this lol
---
Who knows what they base bans off of. I’ve had duped items(intentionally and unintentionally) and never had issues. Same with other people I know. 
---
Let downvotes begin. I’ve been exposed to duped items!!!
---
nudge nudge wink wink say no more
---
What are the rewards for meat week? I already have like the top metas each of my characters.
---
Thank you!
---
Thanks, I'll be on soon
---
Yes as long as your original items are in your inventory
---
Yeah, there are two events. I’m talking about the one where you can contribute while afking. Even if I’m not on the drums, me walking in circles does not harm other people.
---
And I [didn’t](https://imgur.com/a/9whU5tY)
---
Ww.at
---
I have 5 pieces of harder to detect with ultra light.  Nothing sees me and I don’t have to deal with the screen flash of chameleon.  When I say nothing sees me I mean nothing,  the queen, legendary Sheepsquatch.  Nothing.
---
1. I don’t have them
---
2. Other people don’t have them
---
It's probably a trigger that gets missed. Say a bunch show up at the same time and someone doesn't get the trigger. FT right on top of your self fixed it every time for me.
---
exactly ;D
---
What do you recommend for a weapon I have an AAE, two shot and vampire .50 cal.
---
Just south of Watoga station is water and  flat land.
---
Right on.  I hope you enjoy it.  If you can find one with VATS Crits or Exploding, then you have a best in class sniper rifle.
---
It's only the first one.
---
Are you sure “not authorized” means banned?
---
I wish we could bulk every scrap item my blasted stash wouldent alwase be over filled.  Im silling on 241 balistic fiber and over 300 black titanium scrap
---
How are you getting kicked playing drums?
---
I sneak with the Fixer active and a piece of chameleon armor (all my sneak armor is Shadowed or Shrouded, and Ultra-Light).  More than once, while sitting still and all Predator-style cloaked, I've switched from the Fixer to a bloodied rifle and been instantly spotted &amp; fired upon.  It's bound to be some RNG thing.  It doesn't happen often, but it shows me the Fixer does help.  It also offers a faster sneak walk, so that's bonus.  
---
I'm running base AGI 12 (boosted to the low 20's with 4 pieces of Unyielding), Sneak level 2 &amp; Escape Artist. Does Covert Op enhance sneak?  I thought it just boosted sneak damage.
---
I play on PS4 and have gotten that error I usually restart my console and I can logon again. I believe Bethesda sends an email saying your banned I could be wrong.
---
Have you sent in a ticket and requested a reason for you ban?
---
A recent patch added the ability to get one from the Purveyor, but only if you've learned the plan to craft it. Same with Bear Arm and the Sheepsquatch weapons.
---
Not sure. Every time I've ever been banned from an outback stake house they said I wasnt authorized to be there.
---
We need a player driven economy
---
That’s impressive. With all +1 strength armor and strength mele cards no chems I’m at +23 max   Wow
---
No cuz its back. Like it lasted just hours 35
---
I have pretty much the ultimate floating camp. One flight of stairs leading to a platform the size of the build area made with astro turf. Buildings up there. I don't really care for it, but EVERY damned time I try to lay down a building there's a section that won't clip together for love or money. 
---
I'd love to find a place to put an organic homestead. But the sheer fuckery of trying to work within their rules for clipping, random rocks that don't disappear etc just defeats me.
---
I KNOW, RIGHT?!?!
---
I'd still see if you can find out what it was for.
---
You caught me on the BP rifle mistake. You must have been writing back while I was checking and editing my post, cause I caught myself and edited it before you replied, haha. ;)
---
Railway rifles: Ahh, the age-old "is it a bug or a feature" question...I think it's a bug. But unless the devs give us an answer to that one we won't know for sure. Either way, I LOVE my B/E/VATS cost railway rifle. I call him Thomas. And he kills everything for me very quickly. And toots merrily on reload!
---
Yay hugs!   
---
wait.
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
Yeah, we need either a "cluttered" version of just make the sheves also work as display cases (which I thought was what theyd do rather then introduce new furniture) modders did it in 4.
---
There is a "Nukashine challenge" where you unequip everything but a low level combat knife and dump everything into your STASH, then drink a Nukashine and see if you can survive the trip back to your CAMP.
---
Well then play the game?
---
Yep same for me.
---
So is the enormous Mr fuzzy I bought like a chump.
---
I'm on satellite so my latency means I can't do meat and greens. You're stuck with me on spits, bud.
---
Well then do it before 3 am when you’re not asleep.
---
It's at least 90% meme, and always has been.
---
If you are disappointed, I’ll trade you for an Exterminator’s. If you’re into Vault 94.
---
Armor piercing on pistols please
---
I'll buy it for you. Msg me for GT
---
I did because you're dumb
---
How many stars?
---
Ran through it twice tonight, got 3 Legendaries each time.  Players using emotes to call others to Legendary Mole Miners to get in on the kill.  It was a good night in Blackwater Mine.
---
Have you checked your inventory for any new items? I've had the event end with nothing popping onto my screen but I checked my weapons after and yay tenderizer! Lol
---
Stalker's is a 100% useless effect on melee. Every melee attack is 95% to begin with as long as you're in range.
---
They made building so much more frustrating.
---
Glad it's not just me!  Happened 3 times now for me at Grams cookout on ps4.   Sucks, I have fun doing it but don't think I'm gonna waste any more time with it.
---
3. The other 2 are good as well. SSRW
---
love for the arty: expand arty range, projectiles, projectile type
---
"general build": perks to help manage wastelanders (general like minutemen)
---
industry magnate: workshops produce several times over or special other junk
---
40 scrip and 15 scrip
---
Not particularly, what else is on it?
---
Now I know what I'm doing next time I play. Lol
---
Umadbro?
---
I appreciate it, I actually bought the plan but have yet to have one drop.  I don’t see why I can’t test out one before I insist on using an expensive AA model, I should have thought of that.  Hmm.
---
Hi doing next time i play. lol, I'm dad.
---
Yeah it is gold. I have gotten 2. One junkies. Got 25k from a friend. Could of asked 40k from anyone else. 
---
Then i have the one I'm using. It is a assassin. Both are faster fire rate. Its nice!!
---
Right and I can test that out right away, but that sounds great since I’m crouching all the time.
---
PS4
---
I am...hahahaha...got off the game and everything
---
I think it was probably a PSN issue. They wouldn't ban you out of the blue for like this, and usually bans are accompanied by mails (they have been so far). So unless you were notified of a ban via mail, I'd say it was a PSN related problem.
---
I consistently get multiple treasure maps from that event. Has been one of my favorites for a while
---
It doesn’t, I guess, I was just listing sneaky cards.  So I’m guessing the way the sneak perks stack it’s not going to help me that much but the faster movement is pretty great.
---
no if you are sprinting and you do a normal attack you will power attack instead
---
The main issue I see is too many killing and not enough playing drums and spinning meat.  Those two things keep the bar from degrading and should be a top priority.
---
Oh god. I built so much in fo4. I honestly miss it. Huge farms, towns, fortresses etc all with supply lines and style. 
---
Now I just have a little cabin in the woods. It’s home but nothing special.
---
I’m just saying that’s how the stacking in the game works man
---
It's not a power attack; power attacks cost extra AP but sprinting attacks with melee weapons do more  damage than a regular attack, but it's less than a power attack.
---
You are not able to use unarmed weapons in PA. I  once had a visual bug where I was using the Power Fist, got into PA, and I still had the Power Fist on but it was just visual; when I punched enemies it was as if I was just using my fists.
---
It happened to me once with Bots on Parade.
---
Cold boot your console.
---
Yeah. It's the first for me, but I've been getting disconnected in the middle of it all day or just being put in servers with no one in them on Xbox.
---
On Fallout 4 it was 15% faster per piece, so I'd assume it's the same in 76 as well.
---
Yeah. I even server hopped just in case the server bugged out, but yeah never got anything.
---
Millennial Warning
---
Unless you use excavator armor alot I'd get rid of like 280 of that black T
---
I put a few shots into the queen then spend the rest of the time killing the scorched. I get way more XP by just tagging and killing the scorched than the queen alone.
---
At least yours is loading. Half of the shit doesn't load on PS4 and causes failure 9/10. No fires, the spits just floating in the air. It's awful.
---
Damn. Just one more big to add to the list of it'll never get fixed I guess.
---
Another time I'm sure it helps is when I switch to a hazmat suit.  I lose all the armor boosts, switch to my Sneak 3 perk, and rely on whatever the Fixer gives me.  I don't get seen, but I also go out of my way not to engage.
---
aw man that would be incredible!  u could display a "channel" of ur collectibles or a slide show
---
Exactly. The game as it is now is right up there as being one of the best Fallout games today only eclipsed by New Vegas. It's just unfortunate Beth took a year to get to this point because if the game had launched how it is now, it wouldn't have had such a bad stigma.
---
There be dragons! No seriously, there are several fissure sites there. I had my camp near a pond and waterfall a ways SW of Watoga Station but the site was too popular for me.
---
Get your intelligence high. Use Super Duper 3, craft low level copies and scrap them.
---
I’d love to have one of the BOS’s ASAM turrets plopped in my camp.
---
No one feeds challey :(
---
I also have 6 missile turrets and 2 heavy laser for that reason. Just saying, it checks the boxes you wanted.
---
I just managed to complete this for the first time ever the other day because it glitched. For some reason less than a dozen ghouls total spawned during the whole event.
---
Good for you... I didn't know you existed until this moment.
---
Also, why would you bother in an fps if you can't kill things or collect static objects?
---
Ah, who knows. Its like what can you take from Grahm at face value
---
Although entertaining, I find it easier and way faster to use my Junkie's Minigun with 9 points into Heavy Gunner. It takes a matter of seconds to take out the Primal Cuts Alpha Predators. I let everyone get their hits in of course :-)
---
But first I like to cripple the legs and spouts of the Mirelurk Queen ;-)
---
I too am new, and wanted to hate the game. My brother talking me into getting it and I havent regretted it yet! Only thing I wish is for more free time to play. Add my on psn: WookieeChan
---
Cap Makeshift Warrior and Gunsmith at 3 points so I don't have to spend four levels moving points around when I find gear that needs rank 5 in one to mod.
---
 You'll get your basic QOL updates in 4 months. 6 months. 8 months. Delayed until further notice.  Enjoy our recycled asset from 2015 for $15
---
Carrots are kinda hard to see imo.
---
Most of the time I am the only one cleaning and adding Wood. But this meat week Is far better than the previous one: people do their part, one way or another. Did the event five times today, five perfect victories. You need to stay in those servers where people know their shit.
---
For those of you that have no idea what is being said in this post:
---
Kebab shop - a store that sells kebabs, a meat-based wrap of Middle Eastern origin (typically Lebanese or Turkish) that contains slices of meat grilled on a rotisserie, various salad items like lettuce, onion and tomatoes all encased in a thin pita-like bread. Somewhat similar to shawarma and pita.
---
Kebab shops are cultural hubs for late night social dining experience after a Friday or Saturday evening's main event, typically drinking at a pub or bar, or dancing at a night club.
---
Doner kebab - a type of kebab that you can purchase at a kebab shop (see above). It's usually made from some form of minced processed beef that's formed into a large roll that has thin slices cut off it as it cooks. The meat has a texture similar to sausage or meatloaf.
---
Mick - Very likely referring to the nickname for Michael, a generic stand-in name for the drunkened troublemaker in the metaphor. 
---
Could also refer to a old out-dated euphemism for a person of Scottish origin, derived from the Mc prefix common to Scottish names and playing off the equally out-dated stereotype of Scottish people being drunk and disorderly.
---
All mouth - someone who is all talk and no action. Analogous to the common idiom "all bark and no bite".

No Seneca rocks, new river gorge bridge, or Whitesprings?
---
Set of chameleon armor makes you invisible for sure, hoard of ghouls? Sbq? Sheepsquatch? Just stay crouched and they will just walk past you
---
Shadowed effect for armour does nothing, because it works only at night and effect is too small to see a difference
---
Yes
---
There isn't a single time I've been able to succeed in this event. Even with two people Steelheart was trashed after a couple of waves.

I thought it was really fun at first too, but I got rally bored of it at around level 80, I kept playing with friends tho bc it was only fun with friends really. I would just follow them around bc I never knew what to do myself.
---
Regardless, the fixer has a 20% damage buff compared to the combat rifle.
---
Just plant a couple at your base
---
Glad you're enjoying it! I'm not a super huge level but I'd be happy to play with you on PS4: NickKnackz
---
You must be really special... You do understand this is a game, therefore, meant to be played, don't you? 
---
If you are going to sleep, turn the console off. You turn it on tomorrow and keep playing. After breakfast. And if you have to go to school or work, you turn it off too. Your progress is saved.
---
Yeah I've seen that too
---
Hi not a super huge level but i'd be happy to play with you on ps4: nickknackz, I'm dad.
---
I’m still going and I’ve done it 10 plus times now! I’m about to say screw it and just buy one lol
---
Damn that sucks
---
I don't like them either but they get around several issues like enemy spawns and ground clipping.
---
Thats definitely the reason but they should have thought about this before making the tag line about rebuilding america
---
Also on ps4. Only ever seen Harper's Ferry nuked twice since beta
---
That's exactly what I need to do...a good mixture of killing, cleaning, drums, etc.
---
I'm not...but at the same time I am. I guess my bank account isn't looking forward to it since I KNOW I won't have enough free Atoms for the Halloween goods :/
---
It Is a fucking nightmare in my experience. My smartest character Is not a better learner than my dumbest. You may learn three mods from three weapons and Zero from the next ten.
---
They need to do 1% damage or so to the queen to get credit. Then they can focus on the adds.
---
Also another great way for low levels to help is throw on enforcer and a shotgun and cripple everything, including the queen.
---
Pretty sure chameleon is strongest. I don't think many use shadowed or wood armor.
---
With my bloodied rifle build I don't have anything but unyielding. It seems the high agility +non-exploive rifle is quite sufficient, I rarely get detected.
---
With my melee build I have two chamelon weight reduction pieces. I think I will eventually get a third one. Sometimes I get too easily detected, by some enemies. But if the enemies are in small group they might not detect or it might be the last one just 2 seconds before it dies, too. I have instigating power attack tambo and I really try to keep sneaking so I can just hit normally without power attack, except power attacks againts strong enemies like yao guai. Supermutants drop with normal attacks just fine.
---
I wonder how much of it is being mad that Fallout finally gets its own "ESO-like" game and people forgetting that ESO sucked when it came out, too
---
I do! I planted the crops I needed in my camp so I can have supplies of Challey’s feed. You can find carrots I think at General’s Steakhouse Cranberry Bog.
---
Well I'm happy you started playing. Also if you need help or just want to play with some people check out r/PKOA.
---
Wrong. I have a character which wears shadowed combat armor, full set. Not a single Chameleon piece. It Is invisible whatever the light.
---
I had that earlier too, it passed though after a couple minutes
---
It's worse than nothing because it increases the AP cost.
---
In my experience, shadowed makes you hard to detect... Almost invisible day and night.
---
There’s also some bug (PS4) - first few runs today went well, but the midnight event didn’t register i was there - I could put out fires and pick up poo, and got the appropriate ping, but the critters I killed did not have the diamond marked chunks in inventory.  And I did not get the reward when the even ended....
---
Lol man some people are just never happy 🤷‍♂️ just go get the scout quest done it’s not even that hard. 😂
---
Vanguard sentinel with 1 chameleon piece if you are going to pvp, some people like assassins armour but i prefer vanguard
---
Thumbs up, I do a lot of damage as a bloodied un-armed but trust me, its a lot easier as a group effort getting her to land, crippling her, attacking ads, etc so that I can hit her in the face with my DCG for like 5-8k. I've done it solo\\small group and it is a major pain in the ass and takes like 10x longer
---
Wow, I should probably try it again, maybe some patch fixed it?
---
Upd: also, what legendary effects does your armor have?
---
Did you buy the small backpack skin?
---
I went to do just this. Spent 800.... May have gone overboard
---
Yeah the area right outside the station seems to be the agreed upon trading hub.
---
Preparing for downvotes!
---
It was a dumpster fire at the start and still has a ton of issues. (Especially for those of us who started in beta / even well past beta. )
---
I just restarted last week and it’s 1000% times better than before. Bethesda just was super greedy and released a game before it was ready in the name of profits.
---
how much do you get? ik you need at least 5 to give so how much script do you get
---
Oof. This rings way to loudly.
---
I think its 1:1 but I'm not sure. If I'm correct you can get a total of 15 script.
---
I think this comment pretty much has it. With Bethesda's patches it's largely a case of one step forward, two steps back. I find myself looking forward to the next patch, only to find that my experience has gotten worse. It's a real shame.
---
Not needing to worry about script would be nice.
---
Things to be fixed lists and Zenimax games, those go swimmingly together.
---
Good for you? A lot of people exist that you probably don't know. 
---
I'm level 195. I can kill things and collect static objects. But if there are 9 people killing the same things and collecting the same objects, they'll get there before I do. Therefore, in events like this, I play the drums or turn the spits.
---
Power attack not power armor.
---
interesting aight guess tomorrow im going all out
---
So I found out that the more camp plans you learn the more your budget will increase, this does not include the atoms shop camp items tho. Soooooo, my suggestion is when you get the vendors zeroed out, by camp plans. Portion of the cost goes back into the vendor caps, and then you can sell more items back to the vendors. 
---
I lack less than 4 camp plans at this point.
---
I did not know this was a bot but I love it.
---
We just need the trading system from RuneScape
---
I've noticed nobody has really been grabbing them...so I have been...I also think it would help first time Meat Week players should watch a YouTube video on how it all works...or they can ask other players...most people should be willing to help
---
Both good points. This is the ping-pong argument that goes through my own head constantly when I'm scrapping another turret just to display a couple more magazines.
---
Nah, idk if you’re from wv but that would be an incredible long journey. It would be worth the weekend tho
---
Movement speed is capped at 20% so chances are it's doing nothing.
---
Hopefully you're right ive been thinking about how this could work for a while
---
I had mine on a switch, but the keypad switch is buggy and doesn't require a pin. Most people who shopped turned off my beacon when they left. Probably bottle babies. Now I just store the wire instead.
---
The PVP players have got all the attention while being a small segment of trolls. Survival and NW with no pve updates but the raid which is a failure.
---
They wasted enough time on garbage no one wants. The "pvp" community wants easy caps killing people who can't fight back.
---
Ive got loads more for perks, mutations, legendary effect, are diseases.
---
If you do anything like open your map or pull up your pipboy it can interrupt the popups so it might not show you getting the reward but the items are deposited in your inventory before the popup.
---
Mortar shots can now travel world wide.
---
I think this would be amazing.  Of course, they would have to release this on a different mode than adventure mode.  PVE players wouldn't enjoy this. But this would definitely make things more interesting in survival mode
---
no next time you are running and swing your weapon watch your ap bar it will shoot down the amount for using a power attack
---
edit: and you get the bonus for "does 40% more power attack" when you do this
---
Yes please!
---
Hope I can find some, always loved interactivity with other people.
---
I'm in an Intro to Scifi class because it seemed like a more enjoyable time waster class as required by my curriculum.  My goodness was I surprised that there was zero mention of Heinlein.  Someone that help to popularize and mainstream hard scifi gets no mention.  Someone that was posthumously award by NASA because of how much he helped to inspire people to become engineers and scientists.
---
/r/fallout76_and_serious_scifi
---
We do need better builds for multi weapon
---
How does the drumming/spinning mechanic work? Because I've seen an event where there was 1 drummer and 1 spinner going and the status bar went backwards.
---
"If not in combat, +100% V.A.T.S accuracy at +50% AP cost"
---
Dumbass downvoters.
---
Yeah I definitely agree and would totally understand players not wanting to take part. I think faction based pvp events in adventure mode that you can choose to take part in might work not sure though. But I’m with you I would love a new mode with this.
---
Legendary system here has me hooked. Fallout 4 would be a blast with ,FO76 legendary system.
---
Gamertag? My wife's got hundreds of event completions in the ash heap without the plan dropping and is looking for one, shes willing to drop 25-30k caps if you end up having success farming
---
Yeah, I'm glad I got some screenshots before it went away.
---
I don't (currently) run a bloodied build for this week's Primal Cuts events however I can still kill quickly if I want to, however I try to share as much as is possible. I joined the one in Cranberry Bog part way through that had a level 44 doing it. By the time the Behemoth (non-legendary) showed up far off in the woods we had like 30 seconds left. I busted out my Junkie's Minigun and killed it in just seconds and then got the other two Fog Crawlers as well. The event completed with like 1 or 2 seconds remaining. I gave a thumbs up but they gave me the 'No / thumbs down' emote. I figured it was because they didn't get a hit on the Behemoth.
---
A few rounds later we were there again, with some other players. This time I just tagged the Behemoth (legendary) and then went to take out the Fog Crawlers. They failed to kill the Behemoth in time and the same player came up to me and just stared at me. Oh well - we all got a legendary item out of it so not for nothing.
---
Hadn’t thought about it like that; yeah, that would be really cool.
---
The more ppl at the event the more the bar degrades.  If there’s more than 2 ppl farming meat, get on the grill or drums til they are full
---
Make it so you can choose to use a 3 point perk card with only 2 points available on that stat, you just only get the bonus for the 2 tiers.
---
Yep. I'm running Junkie's unarmed but the only enemy I struggle to kill fast enough is the Mire event's Legendary Mirelurk Queen. So, I use my AAE shotgun to cripple its legs and spouts. Then, after everyone's got a hit in, I use my Junkie's Minigun and take her out quickly.
---
They ought to just rip off Dark Souls' covenant system. Commit certain acts in the name of your faction, against rival factions, and you'll become open season for members of that faction to hunt down. Collect tokens from your quarry and turn them in to receive special rewards. And let us commit crimes against NPCs that will give us bounties anyone can claim.
---
Basically just expand the bounty system with more crimes, rewards, and faction-specific bounties. That'll put a bunch of PvP-available players on the map in any given session, add a better incentive for PvP, and leave it as an opt-in thing for uninterested players without having to partition it off into a separate mode. Heck, Fallout 3 already had us collecting fingers and ears to turn in for prizes.
---
Another misinformed individual who obviously blindly follows those youtubers, first off its not " one step forward, two steps back " as its just drunken stagger where you have no idea where its going till its happens. Secondly " I find myself looking forward to the next patch " is your own fault as you clearly based on the fact most people who were complaining about the complainers was you were expecting something amazing and getting yourself hyped up and the fall is your own fault\*.

\*Being sarcastic expect on this part as I saw a lot of posts of our fellow sub reddit dwellers back when they added purveyor
---
I just started! I’d love to have some people to play with! My tag is Jesters7
---
They are 4 carrot plants  at the Wixton Homestead, too.
---
There are many possible innocent reasons and certainly a few not nice ones. Maybe their kid woke up screaming and they had to go deal with it - who knows. I just exit the world and rejoin.
---
I know how to get free Atoms...what I'm saying is that there's not enough. Bundles are often 1500+ Atoms. Daily you get like...what 40-50 Atoms? And most of the time the challenges involve something I can't do. Thus I can't get those Atoms.
---
I don't think you're going to see the downvotes you expected. What you said is pretty accurate.
---
I thought about that, but since that floor piece is attached to stairs it wouldn't let me.
---
If I moved it I'd have to redo the whole thing.
---
This made me giggle🙈🤡
---
Dude that is a great idea!
---
......k
---
No
---
Everytime I see floating camps all I think is "that guy plays fortnite" lol most player camps are soooo overpriced too. I came across one guy selling boiled water for 10 caps a piece. I know it's the lawless wasteland but that shit is just criminal lol Clungebob5000, add me ;)
---
This is an interesting take! It's considerate of you, too. I know lots of players who would love you for it, myself included depending on the junk.
---
Gamertag: mark error 404
---
I've been busy with work lately so I haven't checked my stocks. But feel free to shoot me a message on xbox so I can remember to save one.
---
I'm really hoping Rose plays a part in the Wastelanders dlc.
---
Till you get to endgame....
---
With the change to public events where you dont drop junk now it doesnt happen much, but people who sit on your junk bag so nobody can loot it.
---
Not eaxctly what you have in mind but while leveling up one of my alts (I'm a guy but this alt is female) I ran into someone at Whitespring Station. I had just logged on to this world and this guy, over voice chat,  nervously said a greeting to me (he sounded nice) and said he was in a generous mood and said he had something he wanted to give me. He dropped a nice Shielded Underarmor. I picked it up and in the process of putting it on I realized I spawned in without any clothes - I was in my underwear and bra. I did the thumbs up emote and then the heart emote. It seemed to make his day.
---
Try shoving your controller up your ass.
---
I’ve completed events in cranberry bog and the savage divide by myself. I’ve also beat them with large and courteous groups where everyone got a shot in and everyone got loot and XP. There’s no excuse for bad behavior. None
---
Nice going! What weapons and armor did you use?
---
Yep this is what I do. What I can’t stand is the one god mode melee in a large group runs off by himself to one shot kill everything. This is mostly happening in the savage divide event.
---
I’m a pistol tank build. 
---
I use a 10mm Pistol and a full set of Cav. Thanks!
---
I want nothing more then to just be able to change my character's name.
---
So you are completing expert with 3 people? We are doing the same excate rolls as you, but with an extra person on hacking/pipes and defending and have not been able to complete expert
---
ahahahahaha dude I love the lengths people go to just to make an online stranger slightly annoyed. I might get a downvote shower for this as hey, this is r/fo76, but these are just harmless fun my man.
---
At the moment you have washout "part 3" of the raid. It is slightly annoying provided you don't find all the seed canisters straight and the computers bug, but other than that you should be fine.
---
I fully agree.   
---
People that argue that pathing gets messed up forget that half the time mobs just shoot at your building from 50 feet away anyway, we don't need pathing for mobs. 
---
What's really said is vanilla building for FO4 wasn't great. Mods made it amazingly better. FO76's building is even worse than vanilla FO4. For NO reason that makes any sense.
---
Those are the best people.
---
This vendor never has power.
---
This is hilarious, and also very kind of him. Gotta love those naked glitches lol.
---
I'm not going to downvote you, but it's pretty petty. Get off however you want, just do it on your own time. Leave me out of it.
---
I posted a similar theory a while back and I envision it as instanced PvP zones within adventure mode with objective based PvP.
---
Players will join sides (cultists, raiders, settlers have been announced, maybe BoS, Enclave, or some new factions not yet hinted at) and the winning side will get some rewards.
---
It would share the shorter, times format like a NW match except it will use the gear from the normal game (legendary gear, perks etc).  Maybe adding a fallout twist to classic PvP modes so instead of capture the flag it's capture the nuke codes and then launch a nuke at the enemies base.
---
Perhaps even adventure mode map pins become controlled by the winning side so if the settlers win, there will be settler npc's at some extra map pins on the map.
---
Love building in this game but hate that it's not like FO4.
---
Bethesda acknowledged it and returned items to people.
---
On xbox, my crew has run the raids, novice and standerd, every day since they came out. And has not encountered a problem. It was an extremely rare glitch that has been noted and people have had their gear returned.
---
The raids have also gotten much more stable this second set
---
Can’t even think of how many loot bags I’ve nearly died standing on so the owner could get back to them. All because I couldn’t make it to them before they died.
---
Dead in the water is easiest on expert. But the current wash out is not hard on standerd. Have been able to complete it with 5 mins left
---
Can someone put a bullet in that annoying cunt Sanjay whilst we're on the subject..
---
Sounds like someone fails the queen to much
---
Thanks I already did 6 times , these are mules and  I have no intention of playing them or  din’t you read my post  ? I paid for two back pack skins I can’t use that’s the point I’m trying to convey but as always the trolls come out from under their bridges to defend their beloved Bugthesda lmao!
---
First you need to get raw violet flux, which comes from areas that have been hit by a nuke that was launched by a player. Also need a few other materials dropped by enemies in the nuke zone to turn the raw flux into pure flux. If you're not in any position to launch a nuke yourself, you've just gotta keep an eye out for someone else doing a nuke.
---
Edit: Forgot to mention, flux comes from plants inside of a nuked area, and certain plants will drop certain types of flux. A nuked blackberry will give yellowcake flux, for example, whereas violet flux in nuke zones mostly comes from things like pitcher plants, razorgrain, mutated ferns, or snaptail reeds - to name just a few options.
---
Out of curiosity, what do you need that flux for anyway?
---
I know..I know he's already dead..I just hope it was a really really painful demise.
---
Oh and by the way I also paid for a 50 cal skin that doesn’t work either ! But hey I’m never happy your absolutely right!
---
🔔Shame 🔔Shame 🔔Shame
---
I have an idea. Since the camp system works as a sphere, perhaps you could place camp on top of a cliff and then build from the bottom of the cliff.
---
I remember that too. Now I still get wiped constantly as a bloodied build I just do 5000x more damage between the constant deaths 🤣
---
I think, if he’s going to be that obnoxious at least give him the athletic ability to back it up, why not replace him completely with a sentry bot. At least then he’s got the brawn to deal with all the agro he attracts lol
---
One faction will rise slightly above the others, attract the best players, and snowball into an unstoppable force.
---
Happens every time players get to make their own factions. Everyone just wants to join the winning side.
---
My Good Samarita Storie:
---
First Char, everybody build his first camp on Morgan Town Station, and some one who was playing much much more, mostly interessted in PVP, build a "Fortress" not far away from my camp. He Attacked me again and again, at this time i did not know much about pvp, and i attacked again. Every one knows what happend next: i lost my stuff, i was very sad. But then: my hero ported to Morgantown Station and invited me to a party. The other Guy attacked me again... and got killed by my Hero :o) The lucky moment was: he dropped all my stuff i lost in PvP and he told me to safe it fast in my stash. After some failed attacks, i got saved. He came to me, gave me a modified Sniper Rifle with some ammo to survive the first hour easyier. He told me what i needed to know about pvp and i could start enjoy the game again.
---
THIS was my moment :) and after i got the "high" player. i was watching sometimes the map if some one was killed many times, to get sure its not again a low one who got bullied by another "big" player and jump also to them for protection :)
---
yes there is a limit think of your camp area as a sphere that is all the area you can build in
---
Yes. That is the way that I was thinking of making a taller camp structure. Is the build area really a sphere though? I think it might not be.
---
Biv E. Ridge would like a word.
---
I would go back and carefully edit your words.
---
That's what they all say and then your camp is in shambles.
---
Omg Lmao
---
He’s a twelve year old
---
Not kill me in a workshop.
---
Ballistic damage on the leather is still better. The 10% damage resistance increase in the leather, where as I get what? An extra 1 agility isn't that based on 15 points I already have, less than a 7% increase.
---
Guess I'm wondering what the actual height limit is then.
---
Same, good on ya man
---
Haha that’s brilliant, i especially love the explainer on kebab shops. Was cracking up laughing at that one. 
---
All I’ll say is if you don’t work for one of the big dictionary or thesaurus companies, you should. It’s definitely your vocation
---
I'd never harm someone's camp. I really like helping others and I invites tons of randos to my team to meet new folks and trade or just to have another person on the team.
---
I was joking.
---
  I actually experienced this. South Savage divide there is an acid node in a cave, on a cliff above is lead. You have to drop from the top to a perfect inbetween point to have both nodes accessible.
---
Oh. Sorry. I know that's happened to alot, so I know folks fear that.
---
Maybe this and the community goals are just something simple to keep us occupied while they work on Wastelanders.
---
What system do you play on?
---
I'm PS4.
---
Possibly. Cant wait for wastelandrrs!!
---
You're not banned, it's an annoying but harmless bug that sometimes happens when your Internet connection hiccups while trying to log in or out. Just restart the game, or reboot the console if it persists, and you'll be fine.
---
What I've noticed is when it activate's players would rather do prime cuts instead.
---
Biv needs his own event.
---
Do you know how tall your camp was then?
---
There's a datamined halloween event, I'm sure we'll get some sort of costume from it, you even need to wear a costume to the event itself
---
Waterfall with lead you can extract. Close to the airplane. Great location but not flat. You can build multiple floors with the waterfall running on each level.
---
Mine was when I was at my camp trying to rewire it by placing the wires on the roof so they'd be out of sight. Someone was at my camp at the time and watched me try several times to jump onto the roof, obviously unsuccessfully. I built a foundation and added stairs to get up there but fell off while placing wires. They dropped something and indicated for me to come check it out - and it turned out to be Marsupial! I definitely appreciated that. and actually still have Marsupial thanks to them.
---
Same. Name is same as reddit if you ever wanna team up. Currently running with a full group right now.
---
Well... its end game. :D
---
That isn't the worst of it. It isn't even 1st hand knowledge most of the time. They watched a video which they think gives them the ability to criticize. 
---
I remember arguing with someone that thought they didn't have to play the game to have valid criticism. 
---
To paraphrase Hitchens, opinions without basis on experience can be summarily dismissed without consideration. Ok that was a brutal mutilation of Hitchens but I think I made my point.
---
The item floating error is a bug I also encountered too many times. 
---
And can indeed be super confusing.
---
[https://youtu.be/OBUsGAz4\_DE](https://youtu.be/OBUsGAz4_DE)
---
Oh wow great point. So, we need to test to see if it's a limit on structure height or camp size.
---
Demonstrably false
---
Actually just curious saying as reddit played the game already and is up to date on all the stuff, i’m Not and being absent for a long time from the game does that.
---
It worked for me.
---
Hey add the mayor of grafton to that list while your at it. Since the last update he’s been hitting Sanjay levels of annoying.
---
Also, there isn't a single thing in this game that increases budget. Absolutely sweet jack-all. Many stories but no actual ways to increase it. You have X budget and things have varying costs and that's all there is to it whether you're level 1 with nothing or level 1000 with everything that exists in this game.
---
Totally forgot about the wood. 
---
I use a knife to kill the rodents with vats. When you go down to stab you can pick it up in the same motion.
---
I am gonna send you a friend request as well. Name has shaman in it. Fellow herdie myself
---
I was able to build underneath the stairs two nights ago. I used the stash boxes that look like office file cabinets. 
---
It is finicky though.
---
Meh it's good easy exp for leveling for swapping specs or lvling alts.
---
I’m asking information, that’s why I came here in the first place. I played the game but need to be up to date. People keep saying this and that, I don’t care. I ask a question and I expect answers that have to do with that question, not some silly comment that has nothing to do with at all.
---
Start your base on a tree branch and you will effectively double your max height (which is the cap, assuming your previous builds  started on ground level).
---
Another player showed me how to build underground tonight...
---
"Let's just release something that we've already done because new content is more annoying than use fixing our power armor glitch"
---
I loaded in near the speak ez and the door wouldn't load in (just a weird boarded up wall) for like 30 seconds and i freaked out
---
If you have no intention on playing them why do you need the skin? Is it really worth bitching about? The backpack wasn’t even accessible unless you did the quest so you’re lucky they even added the small backpack. Just another thing for these bandwagoners to bitch about I guess 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
Hell yea. This would be cool.
---
There are 13 kinds of turtles including snapping turtles. It would be immersive to have some new monsters.
---
I’ve paid for plenty of skins. And guess what. They all work fine. 🤷‍♂️😘
---
next time this happens equip the home defense card build a flame thrower trap and point it at your victim then connect it to your power or a small generator they hurt players and structures so you might need to repair afterwards but you can kill them and they can't retaliate
---
Probably building a rad shower my guess.
---
jbkoopman
---
&gt;For the first time in an open world game I don’t want to use fast travel all the time because I’m so immersed in the game.
---
I highly recommend that you refrain from using FT as much as possible.. there are so many things to see, unmarked on the map, that if you FT all the time you'll miss a ton! I didn't use FT until well after I dropped my first nuke...and I'm still finding little vignettes for the first time! As a practical matter I use FT to get to events as they'd be over before I traverse the map, but I try to go back to where I was before the event to resume my journey.
---
“It’s more important than adding more atomic shop items.”
---
You’re funny, I think Todd Howard also just had a stroke at the insinuation of that.
---
I keep getting it at my camp in Whitesprings since yesterday
---
Hey its me your brother
---
I hate those useless fucks too! No wonder they died out in the post apocalyptic wastelands with such helpful tips as....don't eat raw meat and don't drink from puddles ffs
---
it uses a reflection map for that building I wonder what other items have fallout 4 reflections
---
Building is overly simplistic and restricted, yea. In the end they added a few core premises to 76 that didn't get much depth (building, endgame, PVP).
---
In addition to the missing and janky functionality you mention, the budget restriction is terrible compared to other similar games and the decoration/structure selections are awful too. It's like a gimped version of FO4 with almost no relevance to the story or gameplay (a.k.a. gutting the settler system and using the atom shop to try to sell assets, which is exactly why the selection of stuff to build is so small).
---
We can only pray that the Wastelanders update is truly a big PVE bombshell with some restrictions lifted and new ways to build with bigger budgets. Bethesda is really underutilizing this aspect of the game and how effective it is at keeping people logging in. They could be winning by having this awesome creative aspect that gets people visiting and sharing and growing (farms, fishing, NPCs that stay with you, merges to create little communities, etc.). Instead they've got small servers that still can't support decent construction size, greedy marketing controlling new assets, and development of janky PVP and janky endgame as two main goals.
---
Every single day I want to log in and build, but the half-baked nature of it, and how easy it is to see what could be, are too frustrating to deal with. The last time I logged into FO4 it was sooo much more fun to build and the results were so much cooler, yet it lacks the multiplayer aspect that Bethesda have failed to utilize in any meaningful way, so it's hard to find motivation to keep logging in.
---
They're fumbling the ball on this one and I can only hope someone at Bethesda stops this nonsense soon.
---
if someone made a receiver out of a shovel ther are either a genius or a complete idiot
---
I have a 9 story camp. The 9th story let me place a flag, but not much else. I made it a diving board, the water is just deep enough.
---
Edit: I dont think it is a sphere, I go all the way out at the top.
---
I would love to watch a movie (short film) at Bleeding Kate's Grindhouse. There could be an event where players kill honey beasts and insects, etc., find or repair the film and projector, and pop popcorn. Then they could sit down and watch the film.
---
Another redditor suggested something like this. They had in mind a drive-in like Starlight or the drive-in in Far Harbor, but Bleeding Kate's is the place. Perhaps it will become a thing when the Wastelanders arrive. ...
---
I'm guessing they'll implement something similar first weeks of the DLC to make sure more people have a chance to get in
---
Hey, I’ve had that serum sitting in my stash for a long time now, I got it at the time thinking of all the benifits whenever I join a team and at the time I believed that class freak would completely wipe the negative effects of the mutation when playing solo. However I read somewhere that class freak on 3 only reduces the the negatives by 50% instead of 75% meaning you get a -1 to all specials. I couldn’t find much to prove or disprove this, and when I asked here I got a mixture of answers. So since then I just decided to stash it as I mostly run solo and didn’t want to take the chance.  But tell me, what’s your experience with herd mentality? Do you run class freak on three? What are your specials like when you run solo? Is the buff noticeable when you join a team? Sorry for all the questions, this is just one I’ve been interested in for a while.
---
That's crazy people I see only drum an spin so they can afk.
---
Did anyone actually expect anything more out of Beth? I switched to ESO because Zenimax's big bucks go into that game's maintenance. There's some small hiccups here and there, but nothing like 76, and I get holiday events 🤷‍♂️
---
If it's 7 at ground level, and the area is a sphere... 7x2=14.
---
Actually come to think of it I think it's a cylinder. I think the outer bounds are the same regardless if height, but it will extend down the same distance it does up.
---
I would keep the new UI from FO76 and rhe customization but mechanically i prefer FO4 (being able to place thing near enough where you want without foundation restrictions or things being "inaccessible")  
---
Also the ability to pick up and move structures, delete any part of the structure when you want without removing everything attached to it
---
Right? Maybe they could have cool attacks like getting in their shells and launching at you or something idk but it would be cool to have this in game !
---
I use it for the strength boost, but yes I do notice boost in like slight up ticks of xp gain cause int, lower prices cause charisma, strength boost ofc. Better vats accuracy. I dont use class freak because personally it's a waste of points for me. The negatives really dont effect my game play too much, I just might have to slow walk more often. But if you're looking for a big notice, it's not really there. It's not much, but i like it.
---
Ok but you gotta search Mr Glayden on youtube :p
---
Thanks for your answer. If not a sphere, do you think it is wider or taller?
---
If the build area is indeed a sphere, I guess another way to state this question would be to ask how long and wide can a base be on flat open ground. Has anyone determined that?
---
Deal
---
In Paladin Taggerdy's room at the top of Fort Defiance in the BoS area. You do need to do the Brotherhood of Steel questline.
---
I think it is a cylinder, not a sphere. About the same height as diameter
---
Yeah you can change your display name in account settings on Bethesda website
---
I think it may be sort of cylindrical too which leads back to the OP question.
---
I have already tried looking there a few times after beating the quests. Do I need to be a higher level or something?
---
Yeah because activating existing events requires the whole development team. 
---
And because a thing isn't fixed means they aren't working on it. 
---
Oh and video game bug fixing is super easy to do.
---
Ps4?
---
and what is the diameter in foundation squares?
---
Should be sitting on Paladin Taggerdy's desk in her bedroom, which is behind another lazer grid in the top BoS area of Fort Defiance, accessiable via the elevator.
---
Reflex sight. I have no trouble seeing my reflex sights. With standard sights you just look down the barrel of the weapon. As to the Pip-Boy, as others have mentioned, you can change the display.
---
Will try get it to happen on purpose today and let you know.
---
Yep
---
Funny you say that, I tried it early on, got swarmed after the first door, and said to myself, "well, these events are pretty crazy, so unless I join one already in progress with a few people there, just avoid them and walk away if I accidentally trigger one".  I'd like to get plans for the windmill but haven't even attempted the power quest near the teapot once, let alone 3 times, since I assumed it would be insane to try solo until I'm like level 30 or something.
---
if we all start asking, they might give us one.
---
it worked with the gift emote.
---
That's good if you're running zero rads though. Only reason I like to have such massive strength is carry weight as I farm and sell steel.
---
I run 5 pieces of WWR armor and can gather enough weapons in one run without needing a bench to get around 3000 steel lol
---
I definitely didn't die, but can't be sure I wasn't over encumbered. I'll definitely try disconnecting while over encumbered though also.
---
I have chameleon, and I can shoot enemies, and they still don't see me.
---
Have 1 person doing the hacking, the other 3 should be doing pipes/codes.
---
I do have a dedicated perk loadout for hacking, but that shouldnt matter really, i usually take about 5-7 seconds per terminal
---
I love the herd mentality mutation, who cares if your short on special alone, makes the game a little more challenging, plus nobody remembers the solo legend.
---
Pipes are absolutely not a placebo. Do all pipes you come across, its a combination effort, you need to pretty much learn the locations of the pipes by muscle memory, the only place we dont do all pipes at is the residential area.
---
Yeah. After reading your description again we have the exact same roles haha
---
What I really like about the idea of faction choices in 76 particularly is it fits the themes already in the game. The dwellers of Vault 76 were banded together to defeat a truly powerful threat, the scorched until the threat was gone. They then descend into different groups and splinter echoing how the long dead factions of Appalachia also failed to work together. It's a very Fallout type of story.
---
Some random dropped a TSE +1A .50 Cal for me!
---
This. Problem solved, and free junk to boot.
---
How many scrip can you have? I had over 700 today.
---
Yes we do
---
I use for SBQ
---
I made a alt one day and a random high lvl player invited me to a team. When I accepted the invite he preceded to build me a pretty sweet camp by the munitions factory. I told him It was just a alt and he should help somebody that needs it. He told me he loves building camps and would like to continue so I let him finish his build.
---
I finally got Power Armor Station plans and wasn’t allowed to place them anywhere. On a second storey floor. “Needs support”. Bottom storey? “Needs support” On the ground? “Needs support” On an actual custom concrete slab purposely built for it? “Needs support”
---
I managed to get it to build near the edge of a platform at a weird angle. NFI why.
---
They made an alternate set of stairs for like 300 atoms, they’re basically just a different style. They’re a bit overpriced but I like the look of them. But the building system needs a massive overhaul, when I place an item, it shouldn’t default to the roof of my house when I’m trying to place it under my stairs
---
It's their game, let them dictate the story. Feel free to suggest QoL shit but leave the story to them.
---
Given that one of the main concepts the game was advertised on was “rebuilding Appalachia,” it’s pretty disappointing how many arbitrary restrictions the building system has, how limited the budget is, how many items/features that FO4 had that weren’t included, and the fact that spotlights were included but still don’t work, like why even include them in the game? Bethesda knows they didn’t work in FO4, they know whatever the issue is they aren’t capable of fixing it, so why did they use any resources including a useless broken item in the game? 
---
It’s an ambitious project and I don’t totally hold it against them that there are some issues/limitations, but maybe they should have had some other advertising points because it reminds me a little too much of GTA Online advertising on bank heists and then not having them for over and year and the four (three and a half really) they did finally add were tedious and annoying and had shitty rewards. Getting a little tired of misleading advertising, make massive promises that the game adds some revolutionary new features or vastly improves established ones only to find out in many ways it’s a step back from previous releases or some minimalist shell version of the concept. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m focusing on negatives here but I do enjoy the game and it is an ambitious project, I appreciate the effort that was put into it, but Bethesda is guilty of some fuckery too, not as bad as Rockstar with GTA, but I don’t want to see them follow the same path that rockstar did.
---
I run 5 unyielding all with ultra light and shadowed mods. Only 1 of them has the harder to detect while sneaking effect. I run sneak 3 of course and nothing will detect me unless I bump into them or if a legendary spawns at uranium fever. 
---
I have a chameleon piece on my hot bar for pvp but that's the only time I use it
---
Me in january: No trash talking can convince me
---
Also me: *buys the game*
---
Me After buying the game: *is scared that he really wasted his money bcz of not listening to community*
---
Me, still playing it in september: fuck their opinion this game is my all-time fav
---
aaaah ok. thanks bro. I'll give it a try :)
---
From ground level you make make 4 stories with walls and roof. If you place your camp module in a tree (which I have done), then you can build 8 stories tall with walls and roof. The only catch is you can't place your camp too high or else you won't build able to build at ground level. It's hard to decorate something large however, and be careful placing too many foundations or floors as they take a nice bit of budget.
---
From my experience the zone "seemed" spherical, but it very well could be cylindrical.
---
It seems to place fine if you move it away from you without actually moving your character otherwise it's red everywhere. Classic Bethesda, something so minor yet so annoying.
---
I heard his spell, but I'd like to have to explore or find the lore, not stand around
---
Agree in the acid! Got a bucket load last night
---
other than having high intelligence and using super duper to get more when crafting there really isnt much you can do. not to mention not everything can be obtained from scrapping. radium mods are some of the rarest mods as a majority of them only have a 5% chance to be learned per scrap
---
And I’m not bitching about the back pack now am I ? I’m bitching about a skin I paid for that I can’t use wtf! Why do I bother posting on here?   I’m always amazed how you people come out of the woodwork to criticize posts and people that have logical complaints but hey what are you gonna do right. All you trolls can kiss my hairy nether regions.lmao!
---
Neat! I didn't know that. I actually thought chameleon only prevented VATS. But making you harder to VATS is actually pretty cool!
---
Yes, there is a difference between username and displayname. You set it online within the account management. But you can only change it once every 3 months.
---
The first part is correct. I learned all of the radium mods with lvl 40 radiums I crafted. You can learn any mod, as long as it doesnt require a plan to learn, by scrapping what you are wanting to learn mods for. They do not have to have that mod already installed.
---
I have the same problem when none of my crew is on early in the a.m.
---
Probably overkill to have +STR on an unyielding melee build.
---
I've gotten lucky here lately, with low levels and people I run into at events.
---
While leveling up me 2nd wastelander, some random people took me out farming lead (I just wanted the xp), when I returned to my camp later, one of the guys was doing upgrates to my camp since it looked like crap
---
Me and my wife have attempted them roughly 20 times, only once did we make it through without a crash to desktop. After we finally made it through we haven't bothered since.
---
Let's be honest.. With enough time to grind out 6 characters and 2 mules.. You got every daily and weekly. 
---
Hell i got 1 guy 150 and another melee build at 50 and i have 3 backpacks. Whats your real beef? I didn't spend a dime.
---
Full sent, ass +1 BOS with one interchangeable chameleon piece. I very rarely die in PVE and if I do it’s usually from lack of concentration. I mainly use auto Handmade and laser rifle with commando perks and swap out for DCG for mele with iron fist and incisor, lever action or sniper with rifleman perks if I feel like it, and a gamma gun for PvP with Bloodied builds.
---
I have a lot of points put into damage resistance and I enjoy the build, I very rarely get caught off guard but it’s only ok for damage output for SBQ, there are definitely much stronger builds for that fight.
---
These rules seem fair, although if you're having players exposed on the map legendaries should be removed from the game. Getting ganked by people with explosive PvP gear doesn't make for a fun time.
---
Far as I've seen its
---
1: stealth commando
---
2: stealth rifleman
---
3: stealth melee
---
I see this daily along with the “ walls” .
---
Anyone else seeing zero legendary loot from the final boss on prime cuts? Seems bugged.
---
Ok tysm
---
I really appreciate your advice. I deal a ton to SBQ but here lately I’ve been seeing more and more people 2-3 hit her. Kinda blows my mind with the damage output of some of the bloodied melee builds and all the stacks. I’m moving towards rifles because they just feel so much more fun to use.
---
They added grand exchange and trading in RS turned from free market into centrally controlled bullshit, I dropped out of the game within a week or two since its implementation.
---
Fuck all the systems which benefit bot operators more than people.
---
It's when you play nuclear winter, something happens and you get a banjo riff whenever you read notes or get diseases etc 😂
---
It's a world spawn I think so someone may have nabbed it before you. I'm on Xbox and I think I have a spare
---
Why are the vault stairs there when there’s no other vault piece?
---
Pippin__Dreadful on PSN. Just hit level 409 today!
---
Very true, but what if you could only play with the legendaries dropped in the mode ie: no trading legendaries for survival characters, I know some people are still going to get god rolls but if they can’t be traded they won’t be duped and would therefore remain very rare plus it would increase the amount of time people would spend playing events and actual PVE in survival trying to grind for a great weapon. And remember if they don’t have vats 90% of them will struggle to tag you anyway lol
---
I try to help out newbies whenever I can, especially when it's obvious they've never played before. I usually build some armor and weapons, maybe help with their CAMP. A friend and I took a newbie out to the Cranberry Bogs to help him get a few levels quickly, that was exciting. I'm not often the recipient of assists. Honestly, I'm just happy when people buy stuff from my shop.
---
Put everything on a rug first then move the rug under the stairs. Problem solved.
---
Very nice
---
Good timing mate, last patch fixed a bunch of most annoying issues 👌
---
It's seriously savage now and it's the only game I've ever invested in after buying it, I got myself ESO+ to play all the dlc that was out and get the craft bag and man was the a serious few months of top notch gaming.
---
I'm pretty new to the game (only been playing for a little over a week.) but I can already say that I'm probably going to be making a floating camp myself. The foundation system is just not any good I feel when trying to level out a floor area. I haven't tried it yet but I can already feel just putting a staircase then building a floor attached to that is going to be so much better. 
---
Not to mention that if I move it can pretty much go almost anywhere a lot easier than if I tried to build on the ground.
---
But I do see the point of maybe adding something underneath to say it was supported. I will try to remember that when I get to the Camp build but it's going to be awhile since I'm still leveling.
---
Go to the mire, there's a clearing south of Harbors ferry I believe where they spawn in the tree's
---
When I was level 1 there's this level50 player give me a level 15 raider power armor for me
---
Actually I would just like the ones I've played that have the bees in them to actually work properly. Ive6must have tried to do five of them today and everytime when we get to the last prime monster the event just fails. There would be just like 1:30 or so of time left and it just comes up and says mission fail. It's the only prime cuts event that has done this. The others have all worked just fine.
---
for a High lvl char that solution works I guess... but what about all the low lvl guys
---
Does anyone get the 
---
 cannot place, item needs support.
---
When trying to snap a conduit peice to the top part of a conduit pass through?
---
Amazing. I do have the BE+R Fixer. Can I use this as well?
---
I've heard of some people building useful camps near events. Camps with platforms so everyone can get a shot for example. Also the crafting benches and stash boxes should prove to be useful after the event.
---
As long as there are no turrets there are no problems.
---
Tooling around the wasteland early on (level 35-40 approx) with mismatched weak armor and a couple busted weapons, and some rando higher level just walked up to me and dropped my DREAM GUN, a two-shot Gauss! I treasured that gun for 100+ levels
---
THEN 
---
One of the early Filthy Casuals posted about their Gauss suppressor, and when I contacted them directly ready to BEG them to mod one for me, they were nice enough to do it, no cost!  
---
(Imagine my panic after I handed an almost stranger my most prized weapon...)
---
It’s very diverse with perception swap rifleman and commando around.
---
Awesome!
---
raid is not a failure.. casuals cant complete it because they are that . casuals..
---
"pvp" community is not heard or gets attention from anyone. they added nw for the br cash money. they dint get any because the game has to compete. with free games like fortnite and apex. ... your comment is pointless. as is this post. because the casuals cry about everything.
---
The Atomic App LUL
---
they wont be adding pvp in the near future. .. casuals ruin everything. remember the bounty system? yeah casuals tought they could kill bounty players. but it turns out people ware using bountys as bait  and get fights started. its why the  bounty system was scraped..
---
Dude the things is easy, NV is a Bethesda game but developed by Obsidian, is right considered it a spin-off and btw NV is the best and more rating fallout game of the series, not even develop by its creators.
---
We hear you, maybe in Q1 2024.
---
Stay strong!
---
I also hate that the half floors we have are only available in the plain wood or mesh. Why cant I have it in turf, or linoleum, or carpet?
---
Not long after i started playing, this insanely high level player, to me at the time at least, came up to me completely at random and offered trade. I had no idea what i could trade
---
him with. I think he may have just wanted to see what i had, cause he broke off, looked at his Pipboy,then dropped a bag and waved me over. He gave me a 3 star legendary Resolute Veteran Gatling,thumbs up emoted and just ran off. Leaving me stunned and throwing heart and thumbs up emotes in his general direction. I never got his handle, and i couldn't even use it until i got to about level 50 myself. But it was a happy and proud day when i could get it out of my stash and use it. I still do, and I thank the guy mentally everytime it saves my arse.
---
Somebody I got talking too built me all of the sheepsquach weapons, and gave me a tenderizer once.
---
The Engilish UK to English US translation service...
---
Pukka!
---
No, not really,
---
That's an amazing roll right there, you can spec that into commando or rifleman
---
Unyelding legs and bolstering for other pieces (all combat BOS)
---
Trying to finish an bolstering + sentinel full combat BOS set atm...
---
Nice idea, but I would leave it as an option that you can toggle.
---
The thing with PvP is that there are two separate games in F76 PvP: the regular one, and the Stealthboy bullshit.
---
The first fix this game needs in terms of PvP is that Stealthboys are changed from godmode tool to tactical/movement tool.
---
The stealthboy deactivates counters to sentinel/cavalier armor, yet doesn't have a counter itself. They need one, or PvP turns into bullshitfest of who has more stealthboys
---
Man I wish they wouldn't
---
Yeah man, it's such a good game. I would love to put some NV atom shop stuff in my camp
---
Only got bloody and black cooking hats...
---
Exactly, it’s a option I think most would roll with. Everybody I would assume gets to a grind point where it starts to feel more like a job and less like a game. A little less to worry about during the grind of the game.
---
Better to Just remove the floor peice, decorate it then put it back. Saves on a rug.
---
This is exactly what to do
---
Why on earth would you close the door when you're on the toilet!?
---
This can indeed happen in an easy to understand non-elitist game. For example, if the build system makes all the possible perks combat related.
---
In Fallout, we get to choose from much wider array of perks than combat ones. As a result, some characters are combat focused, while others are, for example, quick exploration focused.
---
No way you're gonna put bandolier, pack rat and traveling pharmacy onto a 1str commando build, etc.
---
So, consequences of that are the minority of the players are the hunters, while the majority is a livestock (I'm not saying cooperative cheerful scrapper playstyle is anyhow inferior, but it doesn't put you in the hunters tier if you follow it). What does it mean to faction balance? Good team of four can easily beat five medicore teams unsuccessfully attempting to cooperate. I'm very good, but there's a german team that have grinded their strangler PAs hard and now have a whole group equipped with those. I don't see how my clan, that was within top3 of worlds PvP groups before the great borking, can anyhow compete against them until we rebuild ourselves.
---
You need numbers to dominate here, but the numbers you need are all contained within four people team and mostly refer to the builds of this team members.
---
Only 2 handed melee weapons or swords work with PA...
---
Ragequit I guess. The wait is long, if you know your teammates isn't gonna save you
---
I didn't play fo4 that long.. You get water tp to you?
---
At the moment there is nothing more deadly than the handmade. Due to server lag the first 2 bullets are proced as if each is the first. With unyielding, bloodied, and instigating a double tap can do 2\*2k damage.
---
On paper The Fixer does more damage, but the fire rate is a bit low to do the laggy double tap.
---
I’m not understanding what your asking.
---
If you want to experiment with skyscraper builds and whatnot, try Poseidon and Bog workshops. They allow for highest possible buildings (+-13 stories in Poseidon), afaik.
---
You are tempting me... you play on pc or console?
---
I would love a separate NW mode where you get to keep your main modes character and gear, but you start with zero ammo and aid and have to work for it.
---
The Fallout 4 items are relatively easy to port. Any New Vegas/Fallout 3 items would have to be remade from scratch, and faction/story specific items are probably out of the question. Maybe we'll get Riot Armor (the non-NCR specific kind from Lonesome Road) since that's the fan-favorite, but who knows.
---
And to nip this conspiracy theory in the bud before it takes over the thread: there are multiple direct references to New Vegas in Fallout 4, and plenty of the gameplay elements of 4 and 76 like equipment modding or a faction-war storyline originated with New Vegas. The idea that Bethesda avoids acknowledging New Vegas out of "jealousy" or some animosity towards Obsidian is stupid.
---
Not a single player over lvl 5 that worries about water tho. I keep 2 ground ones for shoppers. Took lead belly as a starter.
---
No doubt u gain more xp I would imagine and I've had a few occasions where there was a legendary and it dropped better than the meat cook. I just dont like wasting ammo, think I need to do a melee build. Thanks for the commnt
---
This is just amazing 👍
---
Old School runescape is waiting for you my friend, come back to what you used to know!
---
Yeah but it's not part of the main series.. I doubt will never see something from NV, it's armors was so cool awesome design, the reputation system incredibly deep and overall an old school gdr, all things that make Bethesda a bit jealous :P
---
they wanna demy you a kill
---
I make a lot of caps off it, leadvelly myself. If you think about it, it’s caps you don’t have to grind for.
---
Often get 2 star combat ones from the queen
---
Maybe after the fail of fallout 76 they'll think about it, everyone hope
---
Haven't tried this, good call!
---
What you call grind i call killing mobs.. What you call making money i call grind.
---
Yeah I know Fallout 4 and 76 has references to NV which is nice and pretty cool. But man all I want is a Pimp-boy 3 Billion skin 😔
---
The look on Todd's face any time someone brings up NV says it all. Imagine all your work and effort being overshadowed by a game you set up to fail.
---
Yeah true. What's a man gotta do to get a Pimp-boy 3 billion skin
---
Hopefully
---
Tsk tsk Todd
---
We’ll keep grinding then.
---
I’m sorry but how? During Fasnacht one spawned at the end every time and they spawn during the Queen fight a lot and there are spots in the Mire where there always is one. You would have to literally close your eyes while playing to miss one at your level unless you don’t really do anything when you get on. But you have to do something since you are decently leveled. I’m sorry this just completely blew my mind that I’m just going on now.
---
Keep... Water purification then. Lol
---
I teamed up with some guys (I had played with one of them before) and we started doing some events. After a SBQ I fast travelled to the monster mash event and they joined me. I’ve never played it before or since, but I had the best time! One guy ca 100 levels above me wrote me afterwards and asked to see my build and dmg resistance. Turns out he did not like how quick my lvl 145 bloodied ass went down, and he spent at least 1 hour advising me on how to get it up. He ended up gifting me some bolstering armor. So so nice, I offered him a bloodied gronacs in return but he wouldn’t have it. He tried to gift me some assassins too but I declined since I wouldn’t have much use for it. 
---
One of the nicest people I met on fo76. 
---
I see a lot of people advising against teaming up with randos and accepting friend requests but this is the absolute best experiences I’ve had in the game again and again and the seldom bad encounter is so rare that the good stuff by far outweighs the risks.
---
I’ll take those caps that cost me no ammo all day, I do grind mobs as well but for steel and xp.
---
That sounds fair.
---
That could be the case isn't it
---
The first time I left vault 76 and was wandering in the woods below, a high level player approached me and gave me 30+ canned dog food and purified water. At the time I was very confused and didn't realise how generous this act really was. 
---
Because of this occasion and numerous others, I've spent a lot of time offloading extra resources, ammo, weapons and aid to low level players.
---
Such a strong "pay it forward" mentality in this game, I love it!
---
Caps run out real fast. Dont chase that unless you're ready to fix a mmo economy
---
This reminds me of a time I was farming at Whitespring when it was nuked and I came upon this guy who had just gotten killed and I went to his bag and sat on it. I looked and he had quite a bit of stuff but I just sat there til he got back and he took like one thing and said I could keep the rest.
---
Wake up in pajamas next to a ghoul that spawns asleep and wakes up as you load in. Like as if you did the dirt with a feral.
---
Duh did you not read the post !
---
If u want hope in something obsidian will release soon a new gdr game, the outer worlds, give it a look and maybe u'll see something interesting and nostalgic :)
---
Please.... for the love of god please.... we have suffered enough ENOUGH I TELL YOU
---
This is sadly so true, I've got a couple of friends who are very strongly against the game having only played 2 hours in the beta and saying that it's shit because of:
---
A: bugs that have already been fixed 7 months ago
---
B: Them having seen everything already, every biome is the same and there is no progression
---
C: Hating on things like the duffle kerfuffle (which they obviously didn't buy so they can't say shit about that) the  "micropaymens" (not a point of criticism if all you play are games with microtranactions anyways) or the lack of updates, excuse me what, there are plenty of updates they're fucking free.
---
I can’t think of anything early on that happened but recently I was at my base out in Cranberry Bog and usually there aren’t any bases near mine but this one guy had logged in and his was right next to mine. So I went to his base and bought some ammo off of him. He then came back and followed me to my base and hung out for a bit. I have a pretty fun themed house so there was probably like 3-4 people just running around and swimming in the pool I made. Then after everyone was gone he sent me a friend request and dropped a ton of ammo stimpacks and multiple serums for me .
---
I know, I can't wait! It'll be nice to play a good game for once ha
---
Hopes are to play a non legendary farm simulator :) have a nice day :)
---
Plenty of lore: we learn that fire is bad for humans but good for meat, that Chally doesn't know we eat cows, that it is important to keep cooking areas clean and most importantly good meat week makes good prizes
---
You too :)
---
Someone dropped a bunch of ammo outside my CAMP that happened to be all the ammo I use. I dont have friends who play so I know it wasnt intentional. Still very nice of you, whoever you are. I can always use the .45s and .308s
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHH BLASPHEMYYYYYYYYY
---
😅😂🤣
---
And armature mace ( 3 iron rods with chunk of concrete). New Vegas but i Guess older fallouts had it too.
---
Please add!
---
The only reason I bother participating anymore is because I kinda ran out of things to do. I'm tired of hearing the Grafton mayor telling me to bury that bastard at pricketts fort again for the 1000th time. And tbh everything I've gotten so far is shit I already have. Tato salad. Recipe for tato salad. Meat cleavers up the ass. Meat week flag plan.
---
Cheers. So it's basically not worth it lol?
---
My favourite gun which isn't rated much is the Civil Action.
---
It's a shotgun you get from completing the random quest where you are wanted and have to go to the jail and help. The warden.
---
It's given as the reward. It's a legendary shotgun. 1* but its cool asf
---
Am I on Craigslist a decade ago?
---
It would be nice to have the weather change with the seasons rather than this endless late summer season that exists in the game.
---
Let us RANK DOWN cards.
---
Wow, very original Preston joke!  You sir, win the epic internet.
---
I love the fixer. It makes you walk faster when crouching. That's all I've been aware of so far.
---
Specify the platform in the title ... be a bit adult
---
Like there could also be a small chance to get a rare clothing piece, too. Ppl would probably start using nukashine instead of trolling ppl by putting it into their punch bowl lol
---
Why do they need to be 420 friendly? You're playing a video game.
---
I just got it during my last meat cook as well. Not exactly sure what to do with it.
---
Is there an alcohol drinking quest? And to think I've just been battling alcoholism for the fun of it.
---
The building system is a very simplified version of the modular design they use when building the game. The snapping occurs so the player doesn't need to worry about lining things up like you would in the editor. The downside to this is that items can only snap where the developers say they can snap. The upside is that new items only need to worry about a few possible snap points, making it easier to ensure the everything fits together correctly. What's strange is that certain items do not snap at all.
---
They should add an advanced mode that removes snapping and gives you a local grid independent of the global grid to build on. This would let you build however you want but would take more time to ensure everything is lined up.
---
RickettyNips? that is a very adult name.  Sorry but PS4  for life.
---
Where does everyone get their camp brahmin anyways? I've never seen a random spawn brahmin.
---
Not looking for upvotes captain positive , just tired of shit not working in this fucking game .  
---
I believe the rant was also directed towards Bugthesda’s inability to fix simple things in the core game but as soon as there’s a hiccup in the atomic shops money flow it’s patch city! The only fool here is you and your Bugthesda can never do wrong ideology this is why this game never gets fixed because every one is so quick to condemn posts on here and defend Bethesda.
---
I’m not looking for people who are gonna be assholes because I’m stoned lmao
---
I did. Several times. All my posts were removed automatically due to “clickbait”
---
You’re good, I had a ps4 but sold it to buy my Xbox. Wasn’t a fan.
---
Maybe ;)
---
You cant have Instigating and Executioners on the same weapon.
---
Unless you have a screenshot of the weapon before to show otherwise
---
Did the event 8 times so far. Got 3 Tenderizers and 2 Salty plans. I feel like they really increased the drop rates since last time. That, or maybe RNJesus took the drums.
---
Well isn’t your world full of sunshine and donuts ! Good for you , I’m glad the game works perfectly for just you apparently because the core group of people I play with every day do not have your consensus . Over 25 of us regularly meet to play on line and everyone of them is having some kind of technical issue with atomic shop purchases .
---
And picking up stinky piles and rotten leftovers.
---
Ok, glad I'm not the only one who got this.
---
Thought my GPU was trying to die, ha ha
---
Yep, it would be perfect for this game, just bring back good old Fallout 1 barter system.
---
Census Violence is easier, which makes no sense whatsoever.
---
Preston Garvey is why I quit FO4.
---
I am doing something wrong with my unstoppable monster lol
---
You have to do the quest line to get the backpack plan then learn it
---
good lord man how high are you gonna get
---
I was also thinking about it, Like there could be different shows with different episodes, each show would have like 10 episodes and a TV would have 10 holotape slots so u could put them all in and let the whole show play on loop. There could also be those arcade machines in which you could lock a holotape game, ik this is debatable since ppl could leave some ugly stuff in there but it would be nice if we could just write notes into our terminals for players to see instead of wasting our CAMP budget and space on walls with those small letters
---
i have the backpack plane from the morgantown airport i have the standard one
---
Have you tried modding the backpack
---
doesnt work with the small backpack you somehow need to have the regular one in order to add skins
---
No thanks, mainly because of how cancer RS is now, we don't need that type of cancer here ,_, bad enough with the mtx
---
Vaults raids are safe
---
Seeing an impressive home in FO76 is, for me, like seeing a detailed bit of art drawn on an etch-a-sketch. Much though you appreciate the art itself, what’s always foremost in your mind is that it was achieved via something intended for idle doodling. 
---
You need to invest a punishing amount of time to finesse the workarounds, and to develop a mindset that says ‘okay, onto option D,’ when option A, B, and C have failed but they may still work later depending on the system’s abrupt changes of heart. It actually punishes creativity with so many illogical restrictions, and something wonderful is only ever achieved *despite* the system. 
---
Yeah, it is a toy.
---
Bold and brash?
---
More like belongs in the stash
---
I'm predicting  the assassin's legendary prefix to be modified to what it was in fallout 4, to apply to humans.  After all, there will be human NPCs now.
---
Watch out for lodes when exploring a nuke zone guys, could get you in a sticky situation.
---
High enough to where I can function but limited 😭😭
---
I'm one of the few people that hadn't had any encounters deemed nice. I usually get killed, spammed, have people punch and follow me etc.
---
and if you fanangle it so that your stairs attach to a half-floor at the top and the middle of a large floor at the bottom, the game doesn't recognize the stairs as connected at the bottom.  🙄
---
Kind of true, if you are really fast you can join another prime cut for more meat 😅
---
Read again what i wrote
---
Same. I've done it about 7 times and have five Cleaver plans, one Salty plan and one Tenderizer. 
---
Last time I busted my ass off and got a Tenderizer in the last hours of Meat Week.
---
Works for getting things closer to walls too. If it looks possible it should work, can take a lot of nudging things about to get it just right though.
---
And make sure the floor can be put back before removing it. You do this by selecting the piece, then attempting to place it back in the same area without moving it first.
---
So at the time I was a lvl25 (111 now ) I was Doug a quest for top of the world. I didn’t have the best stuff. Like weapons or armor and no power armor sets. But anyway. I’m over at White springs to do the quest and I had to server jump several times because it’s nothing but lvl 68 super mutants every time. 
---
At the time I asked a lvl 212 to help me. He accepted my plea for help and goes in with his plasma gun. Just destroyed them. And then tells me to follow him to his camp so I did. He gave me just about all the recipes, enough 1* weapons and armor( just a bunch of commons nothing god tier) and also a lvl25 fixer. 
---
I loved that gun and uses it until I was lvl50 and tried out all the stuff he gave me. Boy I’ll say this. He gave me sooo many weapons and armor that it almost maxed my stash out lol. But now I look for new players to help. I make them some weapons armor and give them all the water I can.
---
If faction based pvp does come along, I hope there's strict rules for it.  Raiders can only wear raider armor for example.  Bos wears combat or T-60, Enclave has scout/X-01, mothman wears metal/leather/wood.   And when your faction wins an event, you get a roll for faction specific loot/buffs.
---
When your faction controls a region. You could get vendor discounts or something.  And obviously have access to faction specific weapons/mods (named or otherwise). Want a legendary enclave plasma pistol? Better have sided with them!
---
The nicest thing?? Well I cooperated with someone and had them move 800 pounds of items from one character to another.
---
i think its was just a way to make the map look bigger when they initially released the first gameplay trailers 
---
if they are ever going to increase the mapsize (which i doubt at least for the near future) they probably do it with extra loadzones like some dlcs (far harbor, nuka world etc) where you enter a canyon or a vehicle to fast travel to another map
---
Camo paint is bugged too. Although I was able to paint my 50 caliber with the paint.
---
OH !, try to put separate, acronym, with "." by means or something ... or talk to the mods.
---
or use Xbox help tag =D.
---
It does, but it won’t be. That would require doing some fundamental reworking of the settlement system, and I doubt they have the time or expertise to achieve it. Look at how long it took them to fix crops that didn’t sink properly into the ground. The instant the game launched with these problems, it was already too late to catch up given the resources Bethesda had allocated to it. 
---
Believe me, it doesn’t give me any smug satisfaction to say that. If anything I’m just upset at the squandered potential.
---
Does anyone else remember feeling really confused the first time you seen the imposter Preston walking up the street towards you in FO4?
---
A guy gave me a two shot explosive combat shotgun and a two shot explosive handmade
---
Did you see a burnt out car nearby and create a backstory for it while waxing lyrical?
---
Its Probably in all bethesda games. Remember this happening in Oblivion And Skyrim too. Oblivion had bonus though where ground texture was purple maps of cyrodiil.
---
Aaaannnd thats it
---
Keep it for if you do another character.
---
Okay thanks!
---
Watogo vendor bot
---
Pretty clear difference between all of that and a home that floats in the air, unsupported and you know it.
---
A week before Christmas, a player initiated trade with me at the whitesprings golf course, I was wary as there was a glitch at the time where people could steal your inventory at the time, he just GAVE me a TSE Handmade rifle for free, back when Two Shot was actually powerfull!
---
;) i believe in working for what u want...
---
Check the player vendors. There was a full set for sale yesterday someone had in their vendor at Whitespring. Just takes time and patience. It took me months to get my vanguard set and the same with my weightless.
---
To be fair, this event is terribly inconsistent with enemy spawns and how much health Steelheart has. I failed the event last week when 20 ghoul horde came out of an alley and ran his ass over.
---
That's why I ignore him
---
like I said, works for you, not for the sustainability of a business.
---
That would be good as tried 4 pieces Chameleon and struggled due to invisible aim...
---
1400 atoms.
---
I tried this yesterday but struggled with invisible aim..
---
Outback steakhouse not that good anyways and not many choices on their menu. The couple of times I been to one, they were mostly empty.
---
Think of the map /land amount as a mesh . All meshes for most games have mountains then lets say they add features like buildings plans creatures well all that adds to the meshes size and as they keep expanding there area they leave a boundry / freed up areas so when players enter and start storing items the mesh takes a hit or what we all call fps drop / lag as players keep adding more items like building homes its were performance issues start. I dont expect most of you to even be able to comprehend any of this but were i create meshes i can only explane it the way i know .. but for regular peeps think of a empty box as the mesh as you keep putting items into it. The box fills up. Well when u over fill a box ur items fall out dont they? Well lag and server stability works in the same way.
---
So we're going to be playing a game of where's ricketty, sounds fun but I'm on pc
---
That sounds useful as well as don't do pvp (despite Purveyor drops to the contrary!) although when I started planning this it was easier to find Chameleon pieces than Harder to Detect - Still have that Stand Fast piece bug it is only 1*.. Do you put Shadowed on them as well?
---
Pukka - A colloquial term from the United Kingdom meaning genuine or excellent that has its roots from the Hindi and Urdu word meaning "solid".
---
Similar to colloquial terms from other countries such as 'the shiz'/the shizzle, 'bonza', 'ripper', 'sweet as' (typically accompanied with a trailing 'bro') and shiok, just to name a few.
---
You can’t have instigating and bloodied on the same weapon. They take up the same legendary effect slot.
---
Just checking you mean Shadowed mod - if so do you find the type of armour makes a difference?
---
I smoke nonstop and have never had a random teammate grill me about it. Most heated things get are when talk turns to politics.
---
all i know is i’m giving away bulk springs and bulk acid as fast as i can
---
Grafton's Mayor
---
I learned to never talk politics when gaming. It can get bad real fast lol
---
Top draw geeza!
---
Build area is definitely a sphere, you want a location with a cliff nearby or something you can reach, to place your CAMP originally and it increases the verticality of your available building. I saw a guy who built an amazing camp in one of the monorail towers. It was at least 7 stories high. [Here’s](https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout76settlements/comments/dau23n/my_favourite_loading_screen_i_wish_id_took_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) a photo I took
---
No naw nope
---
i like to make outdoor floor sections out of two half floors so i can put the stairs in the middle and put a “defense” railing behind it, 1/2 the time this works. sometimes i have to put the railing first, sometimes if i do that i can’t put the stairs back. weird. 
---
also the railings look terrible. lol
---
Yeah I've ran into his camp as well, super shit vendors, very basic camp. It's almost humbling.  
---
EDIT: He was there, I asked over area if he was the real Oxhorn, he just shot me a wave and heart, and I gave him a heart and went on my way.
---
I can second this. Ive got a bloodied and a twoshot fatman and they virtually Do no dmg to the squeen
---
gosh, i hope they don't force ppl into pvp to enjoy wastelanders, that'd be a bummer.  nevertheless, the idea of having optional Pvp "events" pop up is interesting.
---
DAE remember some data-mined quest about running for the presidency.  u &amp; ur squad had to run around registering (or collecting?) votes around appalachia and if u ran into another candidate's party/faction it was bang-bang time.
---
"I'm really looking forward to spending money on over priced stuff"
---
How about they add just as much free content as much as they have ATX items?
---
Not to sound negative, but I see a lot of posts like this, and they're all from "new" people, but your opinion will change the more you play. I played the game thinking the critics were wrong, but the more I played, the more I developed a love hate relationship, finally getting to the point where I barely play.
---
Wait until the end game, after you spend hours getting ready to do a silo run just to have your game crash towards the end, or have your power armor pieces disappear, or have weird camp building mechanics mess up your entire camp. 
---
The novelty rubs off, very quick in my opinion.
---
absolutely.  thats why they are always going after workshop builders instead of tuning into hunter/hunted.
---
How would you upgrade someone’s camp?
---
I've found it highly productive. The more engaged and real the topics, the better. If it gets bad, talk it out or walk away. Easy, fun, and painless. ALWAYS looking for someone to debate while I wander the Wasteland.
---
1 k is the cap
---
Your camp doesn’t, no.
---
I’m using a pure PVE mixed set right now. I’m running: 
---
Troubleshooter / cha / FDC scout LA - Zealot / AP / JWR combat RA - Hunter / PR / FDC Raider LL - Mutant Slayer / PR / FDC scout RL - Auto stim / AP / Sneak Marine Chest
---
This gives me 15% DR to robots, scorched, animals and super mutants. I also run blocker so ghouls aren’t an issue and neither are most mirelurks / bugs. For those critters that inflict poison damage I get 50 poison resist. 
---
The other effects are perfect for me. Having 3 FDC weight reduction perks means I only have to slot one thru hiker and traveling pharmacy card to be at max weight reduction. The one JWR also tops me off since pack rat stops at 75%. The two AP regens are a godsend since I am using a vats heavy build. Finally the +1 charisma bumps me up to 6 total since I run 5 normally (max lone wanderer and travel agent) so I can share a rank two perk if I’m in a group.
---
&gt; Scorched Earth
---
To bad, actually bit sadden by this, was sure this would be a universal fix.
---
I only had time to do 5 "Scorched Earth"last night, and in 1 of them i got 1-2 sec freeze, that is the longest i got since i changed the bios parameters and started using lasso ..
---
But at least it made it a lot better for you as well, and i am hoping this can point Bethesda into the right direction of what is actually wrong..
---
And please Bethesda  ( u/Valseek and u/LadyDevann ), fix this fast, the AMD user group are big and growing fast.
---
This bug has been there from beta, not with the tsrangler, but we have the same thing with laser rifles using the beta wave / beam splitter mod, and you also had the exact same problem for a long time for all AMD user's that was foolish enough to try and fast travel to Charleston and move around there, you fixed the last  fault fast, so you must know what the problem is :)
---
For me and for now the game is smooth as butter :)
---
See how long it lasts :\
---
I'm all up for shitting on Bethesda when they deserve it. This isn't one of those times.
---
Wait really?  I have to try that tonight..
---
One of the power plant events? They're easy if you have power armor or a hazmat suit for the reactor room, which will dose you with radiation constantly. Each location you need to go to to find repair points is marked with an area location and everything you need to activate to repair it marks itself after a while if you're having trouble finding things. You should only encounter enemies at a level appropriate for the map area and there aren't any special enemies.
---
Only thing to watch out for is the workshop attached to power plants, workshops are open PvP zones and griefers frequently get drawn to the power plant ones when they see the power plant activation quest is being done so they can show off their hella sweet one shot Bloodied Chameleon sniper build to the noobs. I personally try to avoid workshops at all costs, but be aware that attempting to capture it and being inside the boundaries if you own it or the owner is present puts you in open PvP and if you're inside the boundaries of the workshop when anyone starts claiming it, you remain a valid open PvP target for anyone else who was in the boundaries when the claim started even if you leave the area until you've officially failed the "Claim the Workshop" quest.
---
Back on the Beat is just in serious need of a rework. It's probably the hardest event in the game simply because Steelheart gets OHKO'd at some point during the event and there's no auto-revive like Mr. Messengers or repair timer like nearly any other quest involving something that can be destroyed.
---
I just jump on the spits, how're you getting kicked? The event takes 5 minutes
---
I was hoping that wastelanders was going to be pve.
---
If this is true and it is pvp, ill be done with 76.
---
I hate pvp with a passion.
---
Theres the little columns from atom store... kinda disappointed me, because I thought they would be big enough to look like roof supports, but they're small and for displaying things on.
---
You are right, but with Adrenal Reaction and nerd rage, you don't need bloodied on the weapon to run as bloodied.
---
When maxed out, you should be allowed to equip any level of it, that would be nice.
---
I've seen people stack those to make supports for buildings
---
I had a place by a bee hive and it produces honey all the time .
---
In Fallout 4 the water collector didn't have its own storage. All water (minus what your settlement is using) was sent to your stash. If it works like that in 76 a large water purifier would fill up your stash in hours every session, and people would be fucking mad about having to dump water out of their stash all the time. It's way better the way it is now.
---
I was the only one of my friends who liked the Fashnacht song, I saved a copy on my phone to annoy them!
---
This same propaganda again.
---
It's less DPS than stealth rifles, but it's much much safer.
---
Moderation is the key. Caps can be made for nothing.
---
This is the simple solution. It confuses me why this isn't the case
---
Tried that. 2 on top of each other is too short, but 3 is too high ha
---
Hook spotlights up to a switch, a manual toggle of the power fixes them! It's a pain that you have to do it everytime you visit your camp though...
---
You can't attack anyone during events.
---
Does it as if it’s an extractor or some shit? Or just as you load into a new world?
---
I just want to not be teased by the prospect of placing a keg when I can’t. I like beer.
---
Up super Mutants scorched and robots can attack bases from such a distance a sniper rifle can barely even see them!
---
This was looking good until realised that the sneak effect is same roll as wwr and I'm a hoarder... Dilemma!
---
Survival mode does not throw at you top tier legendaries to balance the match. Survival uses the ammunition and aid items that could have been stashed beforehand - for me this means a separate character with full set of weight reduction armor that is still 1450/1500 overencumbered with aid, and and a separate character samely overencumbered with ammunition to ensure semi-infinity of whatever I burn through. There's no way to tweak parameters and availability of aid/ammo/legendaries without influencing the general economy in order to test the results. There are no rewards for PvP - the junk and aid does not assist my progress anymore because it only forces me to level up new weight reduction mules. No, I dont talk about soon-to-be-deactivated survival mode. I am talking about NW with our regular characters, with 100% of participants there going after PvP. Have you read the post before commenting?
---
The fiance loves to make things go boom! So at the moment we are running as an explosive maniac.
---
Only works once, then takes a day to refresh.
---
How about: Outcasts, Settler, Ex. Enclave, DIA, Vault/Future Tec., People's Liberation Army, Cryptid Hunter, Cola Nut, Scrapper, cannibal, Chem Fiend, Mysterious Savior/Stranger...
---
No that's actually pretty simple to understand. If we didn't have the area outside of the map,  the lag would be felt in the playing area
---
Call it what you want. You have no more right to judge my camp than I have to judge yours. 
---
Just build and let build
---
Still not getting it.
---
I loved Preston. Fallout 4 needed more sex.
---
I'm lvl 233 and i'm still trying to figure my card set up, very frustrating.
---
No.
---
You mean a location that kills all social interaction everywhere else? Like I understand the appeal of a central trading hub but it completely destroyed the social feel of it. People dont hang out in cities anymore or even talk with each other to trade. Everything is done through screens in one area. It was the single biggest killer of social interaction in that game. You never see crowds anywhere, and nobody barters.
---
That's epic. All of the other posts are incredibly nice, but this player is a saint!
---
You need to look up straw man. 
---
The only question you asked is whether anybody else hates floating camps (and that was really just asked so you could Express your hate for it)  
---
And I may not of come right out with a direct answer but I did reply with a couple of reason why I don't necessarily hate them. 
---
What you are getting pissed off about is that I presented an argument that you don't agree with without any real reason why my answers are wrong from your perspective. 
---
Therefore making your response a total waste of time
---
The only way to make the survival mode survive is by removing all legendary effects and possibly toxic elements like robbing each other for caps and aid and junk items. Make it a hardcore mode of NW, with the ability to use our own weapons, it will be as popular as COD and Battlefield, if not even better.
---
No idea. All I know Is shadowed pocketed combat Armor Made me invisible.
---
I will not be defening any numbers here because I agree that balancing those is a hard task. Awarding scrip is at least balancable because it gives you a chance for a great reward while actually only providing you with a chance, not with the reward itself. I also think both NW modes should award scrip and that there could be many ways this could be approached, i.e. first win of the day 200 scrip next ones 50 scrip or a randomised unknown plan or bulk ammo scrap. I agree with your notion that all playstyles should be relatively equal when you master them and pursue them for awards.
---
This is my main Bloodied Meat Hook build -  https://youtu.be/HB5Zfj5Q2U4
---
This is a video where I hit for over 100k damage - https://youtu.be/EdeNRx_Y5yk
---
Now then, because I love my Bloodied build, I never want to change the S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points. But I do get bored with one-shotting almost everything in the game. So when I yearn for range, this is the build I use - https://youtu.be/bibpUKW6cgU
---
I know they’re real, I went to them.
---
If I remember correctly, Asimov became a writer because of Heinlein.  They both worked together and were good friends during WWII.  Heinlein has had a tremendous influence on scifi, science, engineering, and literature in general.  The fact that not a single one of his stories is included and mention of him is excluded is highly offensive to me.
---
I'd be fine with this but I'd really like it if they just let us zoom out to the full map extent.
---
Start a new playthrough! There’s wastelanders on the way so there’ll be LOTS more to do (hopefully), I just hit level eighty and also I guess am quite bored of the game, but that doesn’t mean I won’t play it! Right now I’m moving my camp from whitesprings to a cliff outside watoga, as well as farming for good melee legendaries. Just look deeper, you’ll find so much more to do.
---
My friends and I have discussed this ... what the hell were the responders doing setting up this bot?  Why is he so loud? Why is he meddling with defenses?  You need to test them? ... there's gotta be a better way.
---
I would actually participate in PvP if it involved factions with things like map areas for control points or deliver the payload events, etc. The current lone overpowered stalker or "me and the boys" party options for PvP just to murk scrubs isn't appealing.
---
If scrip is capped at 150 a day in the main game, it seems wrong that you can earn 200 for one match. Maybe 100? It's still a lot but its not more than the daily cap so it doesn't seen unfair to anyone?
---
I am not wearing unyielding, and my Unstoppable Monster caused a Stealth hit critical damage of 4000. The average hit, however, does not reach 1000.  But it Is More than enough. I use a pair of instigating Knuckles most of the time: less damage but better looks.
---
Hmmm, I've  been having some trouble maintaining stealth in the prime events (even solo ones). Perhaps related?
---
Your perk set up changes as you play too, you don’t want to stick with the same play style as it gets stale and boring, but to mix it up you need like 15 spare levels just to move it around. This system is good but has too many flaws
---
We are what we are, if we will want something that is completely contrary to what Bethesda does, we most probably won't get it. This is why if we want to ever be satisfied, we have to find something that will scratch the itch for us and that the coop-focused majority of the community will approve "let them have it". Otherwise, all our attempts are in vain as our voice will be outnumbered multiple times. For each person that would like slap damage to return, there is a hundred of those that would say "no way". Be realistic, support something that you might actually get because it is inline with rest of the game.
---
I’m not pissed off, just totally bored with you. 
---
Your reply suggests that I am calling for a ban on these floating camps and that my friend is the straw man - Your replies continue to be a waste of time. Feel free to waste more of your time but I’m maxed out on engagement with you.
---
A lvl 200+ player teamed up with me during the first Meat Week and built up his CAMP specifically to combat the high level spawns in Primal Cuts, which included a snipers nest just for me. I must have leveled up 5 times that day thanks to him. On top of that, he gave me about a dozen high level plans I didn't have yet for free, even though he could have easily sold them for top dollar (er, caps).
---
I'd like to be able to raid players camps and temporarily kill or kidnap thier family.
---
Yea I like my instigating death tambo. Hunters baseball bat with increased damage attack is also pretty good when fighting animals/scorchbeasts
---
Very valid point!
---
I actually edited OP to include my agreement that the numbers must be discussed with broader community to keep it inline.
---
How’d the battle go?
---
I definitely remember your GT. Always nice seeing someone familiar!
---
Effects are +1 strength, scorched resistance, less food weight. Totally random. Once I saw enemies would bump into me in plain daylight, I stopped looking for the weightless Chameleon dream combo.
---
Disable that daily...
---
holy moly that helmet looks dope, too bad I probably won't grind for it:(
---
Not from WV but we took a trip this summer for 5 days and hit up most of these spots
---
I really wish they didn’t use cards at all. Just give us points to level skills, and let us respec them in our camp or something.
---
They work like any other "world containers". They refresh the items in them (honey in this case) roughly once a day. Not like extractors, that produce certain number of items / hour.
---
Go to a train station, read pioneer scout poster to start quest for Normal backpack.
---
I've never once said they should be banned. 
---
Where do you even get that? 
---
Because I said "should they not be allowed to play?" That was because of all the shit that someone gets because they don't want to conform to the rules of beauty that you have established. 
---
And I'm the prick? 
---
Yawn!
---
NW isn't too grindy tbf. I find it fun, and merely surviving gives enough XP, along will killing AI enemies. It's also a great way to earn caps (especially if you have already exhausted your 1400 caps limit for the day) and XP in Adventure mode. It's really beneficial to be playing NW during the Double XP events and honestly, it's the freshest and least buggy part of 76 right now.
---
Its not the quality if the game people seem to have the most persistant annoyance. Its steadily pushing The “macro” transactions farther and the “convenience” items. Its not that i dont love the game im just not about lying or steadily pushing the boundaries of whats “convenient” not pay to win. I love f76 so much but its just got slowly more upsetting to play. I hope that wastlelanders brings something good to the table that doesnt just turn out to be more atom shop items ill never afford.
---
My favourite weapon Is my instigating faster swing multipurpose axe. Two stars, not the highest dps. But boy, it really hits.
---
yes theyve done a really great job with this map. imo its the most beautiful map in any open world game i played so far.
---
Dude... Too many psychotats.
---
🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀 $60 🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀🦀
---
We did a group thing when Nukashine first dropped where someone drinks and we fast travelled to them once they woke up. It occupied us for the better part of a day and we saw some cool stuff.
---
I hadn't heard that.  I'll watch for the reaction switching *to* the fixer.  It's not hard to miss; every line of sight enemy suddenly opens fire.
---
Yea one day when I was browsing a vending machine someone knocked hard on my door I thought they were about to bust it, I had to rush to check it out and end up having a lengthy discussion with the unexpected visitors 🤮
---
I support the idea of gamemode with no legendaries and even with a full loot drop. I even made a post about that concept and I still support it - but as a separate gamemode catering to valid needs of part of the community. The needs of people wanting it hardcore, less bonkers and without legendaries I respect, but I also share the need for taking my regular Fallout76 dude and go shooting some willing participants with all their mutations and weapons and armor pieces.
---
I would like what you specified to be an available game mode. There's more to it, however, than using the existing elements of the game in a different mix than previously. Ideally, I'd love to have two maths and two modes: the regular F76 map, and the arena version from NW, on regular game math and on non-legendary single-armor-item game math seen currently in NW.
---
Worked for me too. Just had to do it.
---
I'm cool with it. I don't feel like they owed us anything in the first place, and now I have the recipe for Tato Salad. Honestly, is rather be given something to DO than something to HAVE. And any new events they could have built would only take away time and effort from Wastelanders.
---
what system are you playing on? im just curious to see if its common for console players to disconnect when you down em. 🤔
---
This game is literally a new game from release. It was practically still in beta when it released and it’s been worked on and updated way to much in my opinion. But needless to say it really is a fun game now. And feel free to add me if you want crutonboy2113
---
NOOOO!!
---
I was leveling an alt (prob lvl 8 or 10 then) and had a high-level approach me near hillfolk hotdogs.  He dropped a shit ton of plans, I hesitated to take them all.  I ended up taking them all, and gave the duplicates away to low levels off and on for weeks.
---
I got a random invite the other night, and it ended up leading to my first nuke launch and some new friends. idk if it counts as a nice thing but it was just kinda random
---
Sounds right, but I'd have to check. It's been decades since I delved heavily into the roots of sci-fi literature at my father's suggestion (he was a huge Heinlein fan and bought me several of Heinlein's "juvenile" novels when I was but a wee lad). Asimov was one of the greatest polymath academic writers of the 20th century and has books worth reading in every category of the traditional Dewey Decimal system, but I can easily believe that Heinlein was the one who encouraged him to compose fiction works to spread popularity and awareness of science and its impact on society.
---
Clarke had some amazing ideas and even came up with a few that found themselves becoming real-world applications (like geosynchronous satellites), but he frequently dealt with transhumanist and technological singularity themes and often wrote himself into corners due to merely lacking the language to describe what he was trying to describe because he was trying to write about experiences transcending human experiences. Asimov and Heinlein stayed much more grounded and relatable with the way the technology impacted the humans in their stories, even when Heinlein was tackling things like transsexual brain transplants or androids questioning their "human" rights.
---
You got the kill! it was a few weeks ago at Berkley Springs Workshop. It was Gamma Gun mirror match!
---
I am a full Vanguard with acrobat build.  I can jump off anything and not get hurt.  The other pieces give me some ammo and weapon reduction. 
---
I don't care to wear power armor.
---
I want to know this too...
---
Like:
---
Weightless legendaries, increase stealth legendaries, ultra light mod, agility past 30, how does it work?
---
I try to only fight ghouls in x01 and it really trivializing the whole thing
---
After hearing it for 3 days I did the quest. Don't know how people are going a full month listening to that every day.
---
Oh I think I remember that! We were chasing each other through the building! It gets tight in there, those enclosed spaces are always the most stressful lol
---
I had a nuke deliberately dropped on my base. When i loaded back on my team on the same server, my base took no damage!
---
Im on XB1 if that makes a difference...
---
And it’s through this fantastically confused and aggro attitude that you have gained 57 karma in 12 months. 
---
Who called you a prick? Oh wait, you did so  you could form an argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting my actual argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man".
---
Yawn...
---
I just noticed that rose doesn't come out in any of the wastelanders dlc videos.  What if something happens to her
---
Well some games just build walls or mountains around the map to close you in, but that really wouldn't work in this because it's modelled off a real location. So instead they just made an zone that you can't walk past.
---
A lot of this was in Heinlein's posthumous autobiography, *Grumbles from the Grave*; which is definitely worth picking up if you happen across it at a used bookstore.  His juvenile novels are great and always make a nice 'pick me up out of depression'.
---
It's the most profitable event for me by far. Lots of players do the cookout everytime it pops up. 
---
Slapped my shop on the pond right by it. After the event is over , they all make their way to my camp.
---
/agree.  I play two characters. I've noticed when I switch characters not only do I have the same name, but also the same portrait. It would be nice if my characters had their own names and portraits. You know, like every game that has ever had "characters" you can make.
---
So you bore people to death?
---
No, I use a hammer.
---
I'm a very distant ancestor.
---
When Wastelanders comes out, there should be a weekly community event where you try to get one of a selection of NPCs elected Mayor of Grafton over the robot and they're the one who gives out the Toxic Valley quests if you succeed in beating the robot. Not only would it allow you to get rid of the robot mayor everyone hates for a while, but it would also allow for a rotating selection of Toxic Valley quest givers by having multiple choices for candidates with different personalities and approaches to helping them win (i.e., doing quests to help the returning human settlers for an upstanding candidate, cheating the system for a corrupt fast-talking wiseguy "raider" candidate, reducing the toxicity levels of the farms in the areas to make them viable for agriculture once again for an egghead scientist candidate, etc.). Each candidate could even give buffs to the region based on their personality, like the straight shooter increasing rewards from providing aid to settlers, the raider adding a "protection money" dialogue option to bully settlers into forking over caps if you intimidate them, the scientist increasing the rate at which crops become harvestable in the Valley, etc.
---
If the robot wins, he gloats about still being the mayor when he gives you a mission to encourage people to try harder to get him out of office next time.
---
Yea , perfectly accurate, upvote from me
---
I had a similar thing someone met me at the overseers camp right after leaving the vault, dropped some armor, ammo and other stuff and then shadowed me for a half hour or so while I stumbled around not sure what I was doing. Then before they left they made a light show out of the swimming pool with an explosive weapon and left. Later I had a different player make me a full set of power armor. Periodically I'll drop in on low levels and try to pay it forward.
---
Same here. I've completed it successfully 4 or 5 times in a row. Still challenging though!
---
I enjoy it.
---
Ha
---
Hahahahaha
---
I'm not sure you even know what you are arguing about. 
---
And I'm really not even sure where you got 57 karma. I just looked and it's over 3k. All you have to do is tap my name. Besides, who gives a shit? 
---
I also still don't think you know what a strawman argument looks like but even if I was doing that, at least I'm not making stuff up for a silly internet argument. 
---
Which, by the way, you don't actually have an argument and have made no points beyond "I hate gloating camps know what I'm saying?" to karma whore farm yourself.
---
Why doesn't my shotgun paint work on my assault rifle!?!?!?
---
Oh right, because like the small and large backpacks..... They are entirely different items, with their own respective skins.
---
Same here I have sold out of so much stuff! I went top of the hill.
---
Yea I’ve always suggested two PVP modes, instead of soon-to-be zero. Both with no restrictions, no invite to pvp BS and red arrows on opponents, those are very immersion breaking and dumb. Survival is survival, Anything you don’t see in real life you shouldn’t see it in game. 
---
Then in one mode it’s essentially unicorn land, anything goes. Everyone and their moms who bought all their duped god rolls from ebay, this is the place for you. Aimbot one shot everyone and stay unkillable, anything you can do do it here and enjoy it. When you die you drop more stuff even your weapon (you don’t lose it, you still have it when you respawn but others can pick it up and use it until they die or log off).  No need to balance anything. 
---
The other mode is real survival, no aimbot no legendary and fancy mutations, only your skills count. You use your own weapons of choice but can also pick up randomly spawned ones. Essentially NW rules but no shrinking ring of fire. And you don’t drop supply or junk when you die, caps are rewarded from the system not the killed. This removes all the toxic elements in the currently dead survival mode. This turns FO into a massive hardcore COD or Battlefield. Crowds who play those games will absolutely love this mode, given how massive and diverse FO world is. Exploiters and their moms will stay out since without aimbot and fancy legendary effects they can’t play.

Given me free legendaries after I bought some serums off of him
---
No one actually knows but I think a lot of people assume you can change every setting and create your own perfect server, which I personally doubt. I think they will just be the very same as public servers but with restricted list of who can access them
---
The game itself isn't terrible, but it could have been so much better.
---
The biggest gripe people have with Bethesda these days is how money grubby they have become. They cut costs at the expense of their fans, they'd broken their promise of the atom shop being only for cosmetic items etc. They also seem to be completely oblivious as to what should be nerfed (with regards to events), or boosted.
---
In short, they're greedy, they do a poor job of taking care of the game, and it seems like they will keep doing that for the foreseeable future. They have already expressed belief that TES VI will have microtransactions (can't find the source, I'll try to add it later).
---
So yeah, the game is not bad, but the developer and the publisher have become shitty.
---
I learned my lesson with Diablo III. Bought that game on release day and was so irritated. This time I waited about  year. Right around when they first announced Wastelanders and the game went on sale. I am definitely not disappointed. I am never buying a game on release day ever again.
---
test this and see if it helps, fixed it for me:

---
I thought the timeline wouldn't fit. Like if any old npcs made an appearance they would have to be kids or their parents would be introduced. I still have Hope's for our favorite ghouls tho like raul, Hancock, and that guy that you help kill tenpenny with :D

I'll give you a few weeks before you say 'oh'.
---
Lighter armor helps with stealth for sure. 
---
I don't think it does anything to deep pockets. Do you mean like will it hold less? I really don't think so.
---
To understand what you're dealing with you must understand the nature of sneak and its bonus. 
---
There are generally three factors that define your sneak: the base value, the buffs, and the debuffs.
---
The base value is derieved from agility, incluenced by sneak perk, and influenced by harder to detect while sneaking.
---
The buffs are coming from escape artist/chameleon mutation/chameleon armor when they kick in (when you go into hiding), and consumable items such as stealthboys.
---
The debuffs are all the things that you are doing. Stand in middle of light. Crouch-run for a big debuff, crouch-walk for smaller. Shoot for a debuff, shoot from a silenced weapon for a smaller debuff. You can reduce those by modding your gear (muffled etc for armor, silencer for weapons).
---
They were presented ordered by their importance. The value you should be concentrating the most is your base sneak value: get the sneak perk card 3*, maximise your agility, and get some harder to detect armor (mimimum 3 for any serious sneakiness).
---
Then, supplement it with one piece of chameleon armor and escape artist to be able to drop the hunt quickly if discovered, which may happen if you're sloppy or lazy or chillin. The more chameleon pieces the stronger the buff (5x armor is as strong as chameleon mutation), but there is no point in wasting more than one prefix for chameleon if your sneak is already supreme because of your solid foundations.
---
Finally, you might tweak the values by little bit by your armor, but if you got your priorities wrong, this will not save you. I go with sneakspeed here and skip all sneak debuff reduction armor mods, and I still clear westtek undiscovered.
---
If people can tweak everything then I’ll want one too, who doesn’t like to swim in three star ghouls. But if it’s only access restrictions I don’t see how fun it is to the majority of players. You lose access to others’ vendings and events triggered by others.
---
I play NW a lot on console and I've never seen this.
---
Despite the fact that I get pretty bored doing the exact same missions over and over again just because someone told me to, I could actually get on board for a daily to kill Preston each and every day for the rest of my life.
---
You don't really need much for stealth. 
---
I have heavy leather legs with muffled, a better sneak legendary chest, agility 12, and sneak 3. I can walk right up to almost every humanoid creature and stand right next to them and they won't see me. Animal creatures seem to have a higher perception so they are a little more difficult. But not much more. 
---
I can't imagine having 30 agility. Nothing would ever see you.
---
So it seems we're clearly allies. Voice support both for my unicorn land and for your deadly wasteland, because I will voice support for them both.
---
The thing is, if you can tweak anything, you wouldn't be able to take your characters from server to server, so youd basically just have a private cheat server, which I would find boring. But each to their own 👍
---
If he’s on Xbox I can hook him up with some of my vending machine weapons lol
---
1) go to Grafton
---
2) find mayor terminal
---
3) go around back find cord
---
4) unplug 😁👍
---
What platform are you on? I've a few spare nuclear key cards I'm not doing anything with.
---
I know it's only an hour old, but this comment deserves a thousand upvotes already.
---
Staring at a vending machine for 20+ minutes...... Very fun very cool. True intellectual move.
---
Dats wat ppl get for listening to others. Play wat u like don’t care about wat others think
---
This is totally random, but I like the columns for the simple fact that I accidentally stumbled onto the fact that the little Vault Boy nuclear winter trophies snap right onto them.
---
I use the half walls a lot, I need a half height, half width wall.
---
When I started a character someone gave me marsupial serum. I was like lv 15
---
Yea I’ve always suggested this two-mode option. The current survival is dead because Bethesda has been attempting to balance it to make everyone happy, but nobody is going to be happy. They need to make those who are into legendary effects fully enjoy them, and those who want to avoid them can avoid them completely.
---
Agree. And good list!
---
I'd only put IE per lever rifle at top cause got one on day 1 of purveyor lol. Also because #1 not everyone wants to do bloodied/always dying to do tons of damage and #2 the whole point of sniping is to kill something as soon as u can see it, usually full health. Stack the instigating, explosive +demo expert + stealth etc. = 1 shot anything except SBs , biggest
---
Oh man, how do you not find it grindy? 
---
I actually like the mode a lot and play it pretty frequently. I don't have any particular level goal or unlocks I am particularly shooting for, but man those levels creep up pretty slow once you are passed 10 or so.
---
Ski poles at the top of the world have 2 each
---
I was casually playing the game and ran into high level enemies and they went to town on me, ran to the nearest camp I could find and that guy had that device that removes radiation, anyway I used it and since I had never seen it before I gave him a thumbs up emote and invited him for a picture he then sent me a request to join his team, after which he took me through a route where he took down several very high level creatures including a sheepsquatch, I got tonnes of XP and some good loot after which he disappeared (couldn't find him on the map) so I messaged him through the PlayStation app telling him thank you to which he replied that he was at my camp, I fast Travelled over there and found him putting down turrets over my camp and he even gave me that generator thing and a stove. I was level 26 and the other guy was level 135 at the time so it really meant a lot. I still have that generator and it powers the entirety of my camp :)
---
I can input on this.. my full Unyielding/ Bloodied Build gets up to 32 agility and well I can walk up to any creatures face in the game.. I don’t add any perks or improvements from armour to achieve this just pure points in agility..
---
 Yep once private always private, or I’ll be shocked by the ineffectiveness of my magic weapons when I hop on a public server😂
---
You don’t like them, you know that you can’t do anything about them, yet you make a top post asking others to join you in trashing anyone that doesn’t build to your standards. Just to stroke your own ego. Perhaps it’s you that could find a better use of their time.
---
Yeah, that would be a downside
---
It depends on your playstyle. I usually get a level up once every 8-10 matches, and I'm not even good at killing people. Like I said, prioritize surviving and taking down AI. The reward for actual kills isn't much higher.
---
Few hundred trades and I have never been screwed over. This faulty system that needs a fix proved that people are okay.
---
There's the centurion helmet you can get later as a nuclear winter reward, looks like a diving helmet with a crest.
---
Um no.
---
 No more useless modes that a take away development time from the actual game.
---
 The majority of players don't like PVP. That is why survival failed and nuclear Winter barely has any players.
---
 This game would probly be awesome right now if I didn't waste time on all these failed modes.
---
Sorry don't get that... don't bloodied weapons just do normal damage if you're full health? Only tried a few days about 6 months ago, and with crappy bloodied weapons saw it wasn't 4 me lol.
---
I'm playing PS4
---
Top of the world for ski poles, Morgantown high school for aluminium TV dinner trays, which can also be found at the penitentiary
---
you are basically asking for a deathmatch otherwise...
---
the sound of every bloodied, TSE bully just came in unity
---
Go to the asylum and pick up all the trays from the flor. Easy 30 aluminium per run.
---
Interesting explosive lever or same on hunting/sniper!
---
If your not worried about taking workshops and the pve that can come with it, I quite like using Tyler county dirt track for my aluminium.
---
Make sure to look through the atomic shop every week, sometimes there's free stuff
---
All bobbleheads are randomized.
---
Mine: 
---
About 2 weeks before my deployment, I struck  a deal with another player for a weapon I had been wanting for a very long time: a Bloodied Gatling Gun. He tells me if I can get him 2k lead then it’s mine. 
---
I start looking up how to farm the stuff efficiently and realize that it’s going to take hours upon hours to get this much. So I end up messaging the guy that I can’t make the trade because I simply didn’t have time to farm that much lead while still preparing for my deployment (paperwork, moving out of the apartment, appointments, more paperwork...). Guy asks what branch I’m in and I tell him, he ends up giving me the weapon and thanking me for my service. 
---
TLDR: random trader gave me a Bloodied Gatling Gun as a way to thank me for my military service. 
---
By far one of the most generous players I’ve come across.
---
I'm a power armour user. I don't even have the Power Patcher perk active and my power armour only comes close to breaking maybe once every 3-4 weeks. I usually only die to 3\*\*\* legendary radscorpions or mirelurk kings.
---
Can't speak for non-power armour though.
---
Yeah I get that. 
---
I'm like a 50/50 stealth and ultraviolence build. I like to sneak enough to be the one to see them first and try to get an optimal ambush set up, but I'm not the hide in a bush the entire match kind of guy (most of the time). I get maybe 2 or 3 kills on a good match and usually end up in the top 10. 
---
It's fun though for sure so I honestly don't mind the "grind" so much. I think the big problem was the old map got a little boring after 100 matches. The new map helps a lot and I think once they have a rotation of 4 or 5 I'll totally be set
---
Very quickly the novelty Will die out and you realise this game is absolutely shit
---
Yeah. I did the quest to shut him up.... but as soon as I went back to the toxic valley, it started again.
---
Yawn
---
Once I was running to the location needed to complete the quest called Miner Miracles, when a Lvl 300 player called me over and gave me a ton of crafting plans and recipes along with stimpacks and other cool goodies.
---
I've been thinking about going unyielding on my ninja (stealth one hand mellee) build. I've been wondering if the stealth perk isn't really necessary for a long time. 
---
Guess I'm sold now.
---
I just asked if anybody else disliked them - totally fair question to ask. I have no ego here mate. It’s hilarious that you’re assigning all these emotions to me when I’m not feeling them. Also, how the fuck am I supposed to know that 1k people would upvote the post? I have no ego, no anger, no desire to trash people and no future sight - If I did, I would have saw you coming and avoided you.
---
The only sneak peek I’d say you must take is the one that allows running to keep stealth engaged.. I can’t remember the perk but it is a 1*  agility perk and a must have for any stealth build!
---
I also think I stole a 3* zealots ffr vats combat rifle from player vendor. Question is did you prime it?? .556 ammo is already a pain...
---
Probably makes more sense just hardened and normal ammo, and switch to it for everything else around sbq?
---
With the thirst thing and hunger, check if you picked up diseases, that's definitely on the up rise and the notification is real easy to miss, maybe that old bug where you fast travel and pick up nasties is back and all the primal meat events makes it more noticeable.  I get like 6-7 diseases an hour, maybe I need cleaner living lol
---
Theres an event at that big teapot where you have to collect it from hives..so yes
---
i recommend placing 3-4 radiation emitters around them and powering them up, if they dont move within a minute then they get cooked.
---
Survival mode should have required new characters to be made and no hopping between modes with same characters. 
---
It’s not exactly Survival if you don’t survive in that mode and hop back to adventure to resupply and fix your stuff now is it? No... 
---
Instead survival was just a kill em’ all deal...
---
Ha!
---
Can't formulate an argument so strawmans by going on about strawmanning all after saying it is not worth the effort. But then can't help but try to get the last word in so tries to use terribly reused sarcasm. 
---
Haha!
---
I take back my original yawn. You are hilarious in a ignorantly ironic fashion and I love that. You've made my morning. 
---
Hahahahahahahaha!
---
That’s interesting too because I switch weapons back and forth because the “damage resist while reloading” bug supposedly gets reset when you swap weapons, so I do that a lot.  But that’s on my AA combat rifle that I’m trying to swap out for a Fixer.
---
No way! I'm about 205 and have all 9 heavy gunners, all rifelmans, all commando etc. Just keep maxing perks and switch depending on your ammo and legendaries you find!
---
With me it mostly fails because the enemies take waaaay to omg to spawn
---
I hear ya.  To me it just came down to what controller i liked more.
---
Yeah, that seems to be what the issue is
---
I'm in. I've been trying to up my damage. Havn't really wanted to go bloodied but I may as well. Especially since I can free up some perk points.
---
I gathered that kind of hoping someone might have these for sale
---
On xbox yes, on pc no.
---
Most if it fails its a timer. Just try and kill as fast as possible dont worry about letting others get a tag.  I try but time is precious so if i can i let them if not i just run around as fast as i can to kill max carnage. It works
---
I learned it by scrapping miniguns.
---
Given that the point was to give us something quick and easy for them to implement while all their resources are focussed on finishing up Wastelanders, making a whole new event from scratch would've kinda defeated the purpose.
---
If you want to run melee stealth I highly recommend Bloodied you will just one shot and walk right up to everything without ever being seen.. you do get seen that’s fine, walk 3 steps back and crouch again your all good!😂🤷‍♂️
---
The issue ive had with it is the prime enemies spawning very far away. was doing prime cuts in ash heap and had it pop up a waypoint for enemies  that was in savage divide.
---
Wow. I need to talk to more players and view their builds. Would be fun to run around in a setup like yours.
---
Basically what you are trying to say, wtf happened to the building since fo4
---
I’ve been observing a few events where fails are occurring. 4 I’ve personally been apart of that failed. 3 of them in the forest failed due to mobs spawning and B lining it to camps down the road outside of the event area. And the 4th was toxic valley was for the same reason a mob spawning and running straight for a camp.
---
I’m good thanks tho
---
Like the Stuntz guy said - just kill indiscriminately. I tried being nice and letting everybody get a tag on things but unless theres enough people there to take out the larger waves of enemies quickly, you'll never make the timer. Usually I just go wild with my gatling plasma until the final "dangerous" prime beast I will hold off long enough for anybody else there to get a hit in before I take it out.
---
Hit up watoga. Almost all building and not will have some. The hospital there especially.
---
Or be a real Wastelander and just nuke that computer to Oblivion and reap the flux reward.
---
I smells trolling 😜
---
Yeah at this point most people w 25k caps to burn are collectors after high end goods - I thought you meant u were putting those in ur shop for 25k
---
I agree
---
The lock pick &amp; hacking cards are a pain too. Why the he'll do I have to carry 3 cards each to max out those skills instead of leveling just one like all the others? I have to question the intelligence of of designer that made that decision.
---
Junkies is... Well junk the way addictions work. If faster fire is a primary affix then aa is better. Heck with the right build vats crit is better by itself than ff.
---
  
---
Explosive sure. But the right build I would take this over it.
---
I consider the people standing on the pole crouching of the bad behavior. 
---
We shouldn't have to wait. The only thing I wait for are legendary beasts to make sure everyone gets a hit. I don't care that you didn't hit anything else and that I get to clear it quickly.
---
I have done it by myself too. I can 1 shot everything I come across. My point is, I do it quickly and efficiently to get the job done to move on to other things.
---
Nobody should be forced to wait to make sure all the little ones were able to shoot a gun at something.
---
Here is a tip, to all the lowbies trying to level off of these events, bring a gun even if you are melee. Shoot it once or twice. There you solved your issue.
---
30 agility is default for people who play with fiev pieces of Unyielding Armor
---
I’ve had this exact same moan, why is it not 1 card with 3 ranks. Cos it use the same amount of points.
---
Not really, because with Marsupial, there isn't much of the map that is physically unreachable except for the edges, and even those go out way farther than you'd expect sometimes.  Like, you can actually walk all the way to that compass illustration in the NE corner of the map.
---
It's big enough to where I could come across a location and legitimately say, "Well, I haven't been here in a while."
---
Waste of resources and time for the casual player. Also due to the acid damage causing enormous lag on some systems, is probably why you're not seeing it alot.
---
Personally I just feel theres nothing rewarding in the Vault for me.
---
&gt; I dont expect most of you to even be able to comprehend any of this
---
Gosh I shur do appreeciate you takin time owt of yur bize day to tak to us.  I reken its like possim guts.  Dont matter how much you pul owt thers always a smigen more inside.
---
Some high level dragged a whole group of 30s and 40s through the glass cavern, doing one-hit kills with a fire axe while we were all flailing away with trash weapons and running out of ammo. Glorious.
---
Because porting stuff over from 4 is easier, and 4 itself had a lot of references to 3 (such as the mechanist armor).
---
Anything from NV would A- take more effort to make, and B- would probably make people bitch about continuity. Then again, they added the Minutemen General's coat and retitlednit "Revolutionary War Coat" so they could just for example change "NCR Ranger coat" to "Desert Ranger Coat" or something.
---
Hazarding a guess: it's to counteract the lack of a level cap. Hardcore players could (not that they don't already) bank levels to respect SPECIALs, and additionally acts as an incentive to keep playing. Mess up your build? Start over or grind a few levels out.
---
I’ve had it happen a few times. The most recent time was at UF I tagged a player and be set in combat. Although the games says we are in pvp the other player and myself can’t actually do damage. 
---
So maybe the game is having problems the new rule.
---
It's escape artist, and running still seems to affect stealth. Unless, somehow, I'm doing it wrong. Otherwise it's nice to have.
---
I also learned it by scrapping miniguns.
---
I agree, but you can also do different characters if you get bored.  My main is melee and big guns. Then I have an alt with high charisma that collects junk to sell to the vendor bots. Now I'm building a rifle character, a shotgun character, and a low level mule that turns in scrip to try to get cool low level gear. But yes, on my main character I changed a lot of stuff around as I progressed.
---
MATN would have actually done pretty well for himself if it weren't for the rubberbanding damage bug that shotguns tend to have.  But if you're someone who went all-in on shotguns, you've been screwed for the last several patches.
---
I never keep them I always sell any that I find 😉
---
A spear?
---
You still have plenty of time to get another.
---
I've actually been having the same problem with my bloodied melee build. I just checked it off to I was getting a little rusty. Lol.
---
Yes def come back. You really missed a ton. Game isn’t perfect. Some old bugs. Some new ones. But the journey has been great.
---
Personally i havnt raided Vault 94 becuase of all the bugs with it and gear disappearing at times. Id rather not risk my gear ive gained until i know for sure it wont bug out and i loose it all. 
---
im not sure of others. but bugs, gear disappearing seem like a good reason.
---
have 2 people do the error codes, one person calling the 4 error codes out, once he has called out the 4 error codes and the 2 terminal guys have them written down, the error code caller should do mechanics + gather quest objectives while the two people at the terminals call out what needs to be done
---
we usually have terminal person A do the first and third code and terminal person B do code 2 and 4.
---
We always do the ones that requires breakers first aside from the final one that requires all to be up/down.
---
Yes, I've been to this CAMP as well and was similarly surprised at the lack of interesting stuff.
---
"I am the highest level here. That's sad. I just make lore videos."
---
Let it be known Oxhorn probably knows he isnt that good at 76, he just doesn't care cuz he focuses on the story.
---
You're able to get honey from them however it doesn't act as a junk extractor and constantly produce honey.
---
Long as he gets to those terminals I don't care if he uses a hunters shovel
---
So how it works, if you have already gained Agro of a creature running wont do anything, however if no creature has spotted you yet, you can basically sprint straight through the golf course and not have the ghouls be aggressive..
---
Also the crouch to regain stealth is enough to make this perk worth buying, the running is added bonus!
---
I have full solar. The healing is nice
---
I'm installing it rn hopefully it'll be done today but idk
---
It's just profitable *period*.  The enemy drops, especially from the higher-level Prime Cuts, will easily let you clean out your daily 1400 caps.  And you'll never go hungry either.
---
Can you please clarify?
---
Eh, I expect there will be something for Halloween next month.
---
It's not like they had to bring Meat Week back.  But honestly, Meat Week is a pretty good excuse to level up a new character.
---
Nukaholic’s Anonymous meetings are Tuesdays at the Watoga Convention Center upstairs.
---
Release day games can be amazing. Just be weary of the publisher/developer.
---
I am not a fan of day one patches either, so like you I tend to avoid games from those companies. that is till they have had time to mature and gain the patches they need.
---
A good example for me would be monster hunter world on PC. It was a hot mess on release but is great now. Sorta the same with BGS, most of their games start like ass but mature with patches and  fan mods, lol.
---
It's dependant on your charisma score, not vendors.
---
Using any kind of charisma increasing beer,grape Mentats, sweet roll, etcwill help.
---
Same price, as far as I know.
---
Or being able to convert excess cards into points
---
That’s awesome, thanks! I didn’t even think of that, to be honest i just figured out how switches work recently lol, 500+ hours in....
---
I'm level 112 or something like that doing stealth 1 hand mellee the whole time. I can kill pretty big things in 2 or 3 hits usually. But I want to kill really big things too and I may as well do it one hit right?
---
Ah. Had given it a test run, was on caution, but not hidden. The regain stealth is great and worked right away almost.
---
You get the best buy and sell price with 25 charisma.
---
I wonder if it’s triggered by some very precise placement of the nuke.  Also one level 95 queen doesn’t sound very endgame. What it the real endgame is a level 150 SBK that no one has figured out how to spawn yet.
---
They aggeo on mobs like scorched and ghouls which haven't been cleared yet, this is a particular issue in the cranberry bog area as far as I can tell.
---
It’s possible to respec from shotguns into heavy guns without much issue, so it’s hard to feel sympathy for people still using them.
---
Yeah and they can do it as it’s in nuclear winter.
---
"To be added after Wastelanders"
---
Mhm
---
Another thing is server instability, lag causing doors not to open or parts not reading properly. Some other issues I've heard are the waste of bullets,aid, and resources to keep equipment up to par. Not many have the time to grind up all they need to go burn in a raid that may or may not fail. Also Beth's rng factor sucks horribly, so the legendary rewards from the event rarely are of any decent type. Add in that you cant do any thing with the armor you create if you dont like it, besides destroy it since you cant move it to a mule or sell if or scrip.
---
Not everyone has the time or patience to fight a timer to do some laggy puzzle. It honestly doesnt even feel like a raid, but more of a just poorly done resource sink. Once that doesnt offer a good enough reward for most players.
---
 
---
Add in the fact it's hard to find people to do it with, or the poorly done time restraints, and most people would rather just stick to the usual. 
---
Theres honestly nothing fun about the raids. I wasted a week grinding them out and then when I ran into the second one, I just gave it up. It was boring, laggy, and a waste of materials and ammo.
---
Close bethesda launcher and re open it
---
Well I’ll pay good caps if you come across these
---
You're going to seem like an ass no matter what you do if you just go afk to get rewards you didnt earn.
---
You can’t scrap a legendary for sure. I say keep it just in case you need to level up another character. Or you can give it to someone, i suggest you drop it in front of them to make sure they get it. Putting it in public stash will likely lose it when server crash or picked up by someone who scrip it immediately.
---
I agree personally i would like to see an option at lvl 50 where it unlocks your perks...so you dont need to wait 1 level to move 1 point..you should be allowed to swap points around whenever and how often you like to adapt to changing feelings on how you approach combat..not wait 20-30 levels to get to the point where your points  are relocated to allow you to use the cards you want.
---
I am on the drums, I am contributing as much as some people that aren’t afk
---
Mine's been sitting on my shelf since i got it. After reading this i picked it up and looked it over. No orange spots that i could see.
---
It could be something with where you have it. How are you storing/displaying it?
---
You can’t use it because you haven’t unlocked the actual item. Stop bitching and go unlock it. 🙋‍♂️🙋‍♂️
---
The one I have right now is medicine. I only ask for 5 caps for them. I also sell the magazines too
---
Tse is not favored by any pvpers. Js. No good pvper has any use for a tse weapon.
---
Same here. Got a few low level weapons that made leveling up very easy. Level 1-15: level 1 bloodied hunting rifle, level 15-25: level 15 bloodied handmade, level 25-50: level 25 bloodied 50 cal 💪
---
IE Lever is definitely one of the rarest and best options.  It’s a great gun. 👍
---
this feature would definitely bring me back after not playing for months, I tried playing recently just to change my camp but got bored cause it looked so empty :(
---
They should have just used fallout 4's perk system but added some new perks
---
Awesome … you're at least the 10th person to say that within 24 hours.
---
It's nice people are enjoying the game NOW. NOW that most of the problem us early adopters got the shaft for … for many, many, many months. Now that WE, who paid full price for beta access, funded most of the improvements for the newer people who not only get the game in a much better state, but also at a huge discount if not free as many places were GIVING IT AWAY.
---
If it sounds like I'm salty .. I am. This game was a dumpster fire and still is for the most part. Stuff from FO4 IS STILL WRONG in this game … that is unacceptable.
---
Anyway off from my tangent. Glad you enjoy this game. I frankily am tried of it and quit a month after release … the worst 79.99 spent :/. Wait it's like 39.99 from the tri edition now … SALT.
---
At the weapons bench, with auto receiver (assuming you have the plan)
---
All the bugs / laginess were a disincentive on something that, atleast initially (not sure if still true as bugs keep me away), relied heavily on one of the least fun mechanics of the game - fixing pipes set against a time limit and up against endless waves of monsters. 
---
I've never found that sort of thing particularly interesting and the raids just took it to a new level - atleast you can bypass the reactor bit in a silo run...
---
Well, I guess you shouldn’t have pre-ordered then. It really does not make sense to do that, since buyer’s remorse is almost sure to occur. Oh well, I’m sorry you didn’t enjoy your experience (this may seem like sarcasm but it isn’t so please don’t be offended).
---
Making more modes just splits the already small community apart more, we already saw how three modes led to NW and survival both being super empty
---
Clarify what? That this is one of The worst games ever? Yeah it is 🙂
---
Yeah, along with cheap ammo it is a beast. Drum mag and automatic will be deadly in PVE and look into the the pipe weapons perks too
---
shit, I'm 37 and having a hard time figuring out how to level and what to use it on. I can't imagine it at that point.
---
I've got them both. If you're on PC I'll sell them to you, 50 caps each
---
Ughh do you mean like at the workshops?
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
AH system like wow would be better, but I think it would be hard to make the economy work right? Idk.
---
But that would make my rank 5, rank 4, rank 3, rank 2, and single rank Gunsmith perk bundles obsolete!
---
I only had to level up 15 times to build that out...
---
Hard Bargain perk.
---
Glad you having fun.
---
I sent a friend request
---
Well, I met someone in this sub who really made me enjoy the game more. Power leveled me up, made me some armor, and some handmades as I leveled up, and now we sometimes do nuke runs together! I'm mainly a solo player, but this brought more joy to the game
---
That’s exactly what’s happening.
---
Rofl. "logical". It's a small backpack. For your mules. Does the skin say it's for small backpacks?
---
Youre the type who wouldn't even be bitching if they *never* added small backpacks, but they did and now you whine about it.
---
Go to a relay tower. Load the holotape in. Call in a supple drop. You should have a side quest for your first supply drop in your pip. Cant remember the name.
---
PA is incredibly better when it comes to not breaking.
---
Blah blah blah.
---
Or just the ones you accidentally took because you didn't know any better at level 3. We should be able to sell those back, maybe, give us one new perk card at level one for five points worth of cards traded in, or something along those lines.
---
making new friends in game is not as easy as ghoulfriend makes it out to be. the vast majority plays solo and the only time you'll see people clumped together is in events or when someone launches a nuke.
---
just tell them there's a BR mode now. everyone loves BRs.
---
I bought it a month or so after its release, absolutely HATED this game, I came back after a few months to see that it's gradually improving. Now I kinda like it again. 
---
I appreciate your disdain, because I share some of your feelings. When this game was first released, it was absolutely broken. But now, it IS getting better.
---
If I see some other guy on the drums while I’m doing the event normally, I don’t care. That is part of the event. They made six spots to afk at while contributing because they knew people would do this
---
Thank you, really good to know
---
Shadowed, muffled and ultralight are what you want.
---
I personally use a dense torso mod and one stabilized arm, because I use guns and explosions hurt.
---
I seem to always have one disease or other, it is annoying, I even have a disease resist piece of armor and one swat from every ghoul disease.  Come on Todd.
---
That sounds good and if we were able to do it at any time would also be graat
---
Would you mind sharing your build? I'll do my best to help. I run a bloodied tank melee, and don't have issues with dying or stuff breaking that often (I can keep up with the ballistic demand).
---
Use this - https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Maybe also have the old style fallout map from on the pip-boy
---
But if you are noticably still on the drums for three hours straight, people will start to get annoyed and think "look at this ass"
---
Nope. Those two are almost pointless if everyone is getting meat. Do you even pay attention to the bar?  
---
You can reach tier 3 with a few people if everyone is turning in meat.
---
Pick up trash and put out fires AS you get meat and greens and it helps prevent degredstion oodles better than the worthless drums.
---
I keep saying there was a stealth buff to mobs a while ago. like 2 patches ago.
---
some people noticed it, too. but mostly it went under the radar.
---
I usually place all to that is why I asked this question because it gets boring solo
---
Fashnact is a seasonal event that’s tied to a real world celebration so I doubt it’ll occur more than once a year-you can only burn away old man winter once until he returns the next year
---
No.  Don't get on the damn drums if there are 3 people at the event. The drums a fucking useless.
---
I make most of my friends from trading or at queen events
---
Reason we need a respec vendor bot...........
---
I tested stealth extensively and the only explanation I can come up with is that your movement is *heavily* tied to the server.
---
try sneaking during the week during dead hours vs the weekend. it's day and night.
---
I resisted it for a long time, but it is totally worth it and adds a bit of threat of dying that was missing when I played high health.  Even running 50% health much of the time is worth it.  You just need the right Armor and Perks to be survivable.
---
Didn’t take too long then haha
---
Your a goddam moron , but hey I gave you something to crawl out from under your bridge right ,simpleton . Lmao
---
Following you off topic here, but I'd give my left nut for a way to add poison resist to PA.
---
Don't listen to these people. I've done the event with only 2-3 people before and all you need is to turn in meat and greens.
---
Picking up trash and putting out fires *while* collecting critter meat does more for slowing degredstion than passively sitting at the f'ing drums.
---
Glowing pustules is a seriously dangerous one.
---
Exactly.. I one hit the sheepsquach and scorchbeasts so it’s definitely worth investing into Bloodied.. why take 2/3 times the amount of time to kill things when you can do it in 1?
---
you call in a few from relay towers..
---
it should only take 3 or 4 before you realize they are bunk and not really worth the time..
---
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. As it is now, if you have your heart set on collecting every rank of every perk, you'll be past level 580 by the time you got them all. If you only had to max-rank each perk, I think you would be finished around level 300.
---
Says the guy who can't figure out skins are for standard backpacks. But enjoy being banned from the forum.
---
It’s a goddam backpack so I should be able to use a backpack skin on it! Derpa derp!
---
This here's the answer.
---
I traded with one guy one then he just left
---
I'm so glad you can't think of anything yourself so you jock and parrot the same thing someone else just told you. Great feat of original thought there. Maybe practice another feat relative for you and comprehend the difference between "small" and "standard" backpacks.
---
Coming from the genius that can’t understand a backpack is a backpack so wtf does it matter it hey I’m the sad little child right. Wow your stupidity is deafening .
---
Build the minigun on a workbench and scrap it. Use super duper card in the luck tree and you get a chance for multiple builds for the price of one which is useful when “learning”
---
I didn’t even read this.
---
We want the kill'em'all. You want the survival. You didn't get the survival because kill'em'all people didn't get the kill'em'all. If kill'em'all is provided, survival will not be spoiled by kill'em'all approach.
---
Alright, no worries buddy. Will just park what I can offer here for you.
---
The main considerations are:
---
- Serendipity - 45% DR flat. Probably the most OP perk in the whole game.
---
- Dodgy - Dependent on AP, but also crazy OP.
---
- Blocker - Flat DR against melee (ghouls!). I don't even see how any melee could play without this.
---
I recommend against relying on stuff like sentinel or cavalier for a melee. You're highly mobile but not always sprinting, so neither help you most of the time.
---
Makeshift warrior and White Knight are up to you - a feel thing, but if you're going to pick only one, it should be White Knight. Ballistic fibre is PAINFUL to farm.
---
I'll add more later if you want me to. Here's my build for reference - it can be optimised more, but I wanted a generalist PvE non-PA tank. Using a meathook at the moment, but if you are using another melee weapon, make sure to add back in Martial Artist - I left it out because everything dies in one hit.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f1648bb&amp;d=s92se2ss2sg2s50si0sj0pe0eu0c72i44ir2a12a00au2la2lt2lu2l71am2ej4aj0&amp;w=&amp;n=PvE%20Bloodied%20Hook%20Tank&amp;m=c249fe8gh&amp;nw=
---
I use full unyielding, but 3UY/2Bolst is an option for sure.
---
It honestly depends on what build you are going for. Melee or heavy guns would be strength,  rifleman is perception,  etc.
---
Yup
---
Happy cake day BGS 🎂
---
New items like salty mods, recipes, plans, outfits, etc. along with scrip you get from the collected prime meat
---
Event ends on the 3rd of October so try to join in on the cook out while you still can
---
As weapons? I mean 'good' is also relative. If you do not have any legendary weapons the mmg is a nice hand to hand weapon and the ski sword is also a decent 1H weapon. Early in the game I used one with the spikes on it for quite a while. By the time I learned the mmg I was already mostly 2h in power armor.
---
I think the ski sword looks cool and I still have a few MMG with nice stats for when I want to use them. 
---
If you are comparing them to other weapons you can craft to use I would say the mmg is probably the best weapon you can craft since you can't craft a deathclaw gauntlet (that I know of). Some may argue the meat hook is better since you can also use hand to hand and 1H with it, but if you have all of those perks maxed out you probably already have better legendaries or should be looking at them. Then it's not what can you make it's what can you buy/trade or acquire via drop. 
---
Unfortunately what is 'good' really depends on you, where you are I. The game, what play style you like, etc. Some people only want a certain look, some people will wear a pink furry suit if it gives them .01% more Dmg, neither is wrong, just depends on the player. 
---
If you really want to compare for raw damage you can search for a damage comparison chart or check out this calculator someone posted to Reddit a while back:
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
The codes are over at Nuka-Crypt: [https://nukacrypt.com/](https://nukacrypt.com/)
---
Typically, they change every Tuesday at 5:00pm Pacific now.  It used to be Monday, but it's been Tuesday for the past few weeks.  You can figure out the codes for yourself, through the rather tedious process of collecting the different keycards off the Scorched Officers and solving the word puzzle, but not many players do because it's rather esoteric.
---
It's a good idea to bring more than one Nuclear Keycard to the silo, because if you enter the code wrong, that consumes the keycard and you'll need to spend another to try again.  Entering the last digit automatically checks to see if the code is correct, so make sure it is before you do it.
---
If you intend to fight the Scorchbeast Queen, target the nuke at Fissure Site Prime (not to be confused with the other Fissure Site near it).  It's a good idea to leave Drop Site V9 out of the blast radius to allow melees (esp. Bloodied melees) to participate.
---
https://nukacrypt.com
---
This site has the codes.
---
Imagine discussing about the game without throwing insults
---
I'm not sure if it still works or not but for a while if you left them single shot and put a stock on it you could get both the rifleman perks and gunslinger perks to apply for damage.  Might be worth checking out.
---
It’s a known bug to have the following cargo containers.
---
People either like it or they don’t just like other games... if they don’t want to roll find friends that do... simple as that...
---
Google Nukacrypt - the weekly codes are posted on there. Once you reach the final room in the silo and take care of the last task there, the room will go dark - you'll put in your nuclear keycard and then you'll be able to access the keypad for the code.
---
The keypad is unforgiving if you mess up - you'll have to use another keycard if you accidentally put in the wrong code. Make sure you're looking at the code for the silo that you're in, and that you put the numbers in correctly.
---
No way dude. Make it so we can buy the cards we need insted. I would not be happy to get script for my perk cards. Script is easy to get when you farm the regular legendary spots. I always run out of scrip allowance. I would so much rather trading perk cards for other perk cards.
---
personally I just make a new character whenever I want to try a new build. adrenal reaction and stealth will carry you to level 50.
---
there's no legendary PA so you're limited to mods. all in all it's a lot less tanky than regular armor because no sentinel, although emergency protocols does a good enough job. you instantly get a ton of DR and ER though, without farming buttressed mods and badges for the armored backpack, so there's that. no unyielding also means your melee damage is nowhere near that of a non-PA build.
---
PA shines in two regards: RR and durability. rad damage will eat through regular armor and is deadly for bloodied builds, so much so that you have to switch to a hazmat. nukes are still a bit too much for PA, kinda, but ghouls will barely scratch you. but the real pro in my opinion is that you don't have to farm for ballistic fiber every other session because PA does not need it, and lasts a lot longer than regular armor.
---
oh, and you can jump off cliffs. no unarmed though, and stealth in PA is crap.
---
I would like to see Rose be part of the driving force behind the raiders when Wastelanders shows up. I think it would be a great reason to be added to the lore. Rose's messages about joining the raiders is heard and attracts all kinds of riff raff lol
---
Modes were empty because they didn't carter to the needs of all competetive people, only to some, and it was hard to get to the people.with similar needs as yours. My suggestion answers that.
---
Max your Class Freak card at it reduces 75% of the bad in mutations
---
It's like 15 bucks brand new now, buy it for a few friends for Christmas lol. But seriously it would be nice if they did like a free weekend again. The free week in June convinced me to buy it and I was able to put a few friends onto the free week that ended up buying it too.
---
Thank you! How do I know which of the three codes I’ll need to input?
---
Kill a bunch of scorched at morgantown airport. They drop lots of pipe pistols and sometimes shotguns. Scrap them to unlock mods
---
Wow you really Schooled me on that one. Thanks ! 
---
Oh man I’m sorry , I wasn’t aware of your condition , so sorry.... so sorry . Where did you contract troll stupidity ?
---
This overprepared minority is capable of getting their targets from the majority that dislikes the idea. Why don't give them something that would make them leave you guys and gals alone?
---
Best time to sell is when on a team with right perk cards played using chems to boost charisma... huge difference!
---
You can't move with the chameleon effect so it doesn't help all that much in that regard. But there is the one perk that does help specifically. 
---
I think someone did some research a time ago and only one piece of chameleon armor really does anything. 
---
But that is all really moot as no AI can see you once you get passed certain agility score. It's not much either. Maybe 15-20.
---
Build pipe pistols and scrap tgem there's a ton of mods but you'll learn them quick. Also check Raider Vendor bots for the plans. Sunnyside station the WS one etc
---
That Fixer is excellent, I am jealous.
---
Got it a few times after doing cargo drop event at morgantown airport
---
As long as it is also the last swing does that really matter?
---
Each silo has its own code check that website
---
Thankyou very much!
---
Reading these comments seriously had me laughing out loud. You all are crazy.
---
Lol I would have gotten there faster had i not wasted so many points on... well, many perks I wish I hadn't. Night Eyes might have been the biggest waste
---
Do you mean pip boy skins in game? The 'kit' part of the post makes me think irl pipboys but then you mention the Nexus. If skins, then I'm partial to my Red Rocket, wish there was some other red rocket stuff in game to go with it. I bought the Slocum's Joe pip boy too but nothing goes well with it and they haven't released anything else besides PA skins for donuts. I also would like an Arktos Pharma skin tbh, I play an arktos pharma scientist
---
The most you'd most likely get, would be 30 caps
---
You're welcome. No point in buying a mod if you can learn the plan.
---
By the way I’m still waiting on that ban you promised so I don’t have to read your comments anymore !
---
this is my go to, the healthy chunk of steel for ammo is also nice from the amount of things you scrap
---
 "You really schooled me on that one." Lot of truth in your attempted snide remark. 
---
Yawn. You're being obstinate and boring in your barely registered insults.
---
I like it when a dead SB just randomly drops fron the sky.
---
I’m the person who ignores the constant requests from random people I don’t know, even though I also have the mutation. 😂
---
Highly doubt Scorchbeasts will disappear, they’re too integral to the story. I would expect to see them contained more towards Cranberry Bog, with only the toughest of the new NPC’s making their home there. Got images of raiders wearing SB skin as armour and the leader wearing one of their heads as a crown
---
in that cause the griever will then just use the emote as well to not get killed ontop of also having to go and make it be that you can be killed even when you got passive mode on.
---
who knows maybe it will be since sony's policy on crossplay changed, i mean the new modern warfare has crossplay between pc, xbox, and ps4
---
edit: and one of the reasons bethesda said fallout 76 wasn't crossplay was because, "sony was not as helpful as everyone would like"
---
Bethesda has said scorchbeasts won't be going anywhere, I don't remember where, I think it was in the original clean Appalachia article, but it was somewhere
---
If you do the quest he will stop for awhile, but will start up again at a later date. If you get the corpse and keep it with you..don't bury it..the mayor will shut up for good.
---
I want me some Saradomin paint for my Ultracite PA =)
---
Vault 94 was dead after about a week, I’ve never seen any of the gear for sale or being used on PS4.
---
\*edit for reading comprehension\* Nevermind, I see melee build now.
---
Because they’re all dead.. and now they are a trophy. Imagine that the last year of queen killing was all just one day, one battle, and the site is sealed.
---
Well, Bethesda has said that all the old contens will be there, but some locations might be "adjusted" ..
---
So maybe we’ll still have little fissures here and there, but perhaps, the prime site is sealed.
---
Just in case u/QualityMeatShield doesn't know, it's not *literally* nukes and dragons, it's this wonderful website that lets you plan your build as well as share and see other's builds. 
---
Here's a link.
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks
---
Some friends were saying they were getting more easily trashed by assultrons and higher level enemies which they thought they could handle before .. so I guess bugs or tweaks maybe. I haven't found it myself, assultrons seem the same for me, I am a PA player ..
---
hahaha I guessed as much
---
I had no idea until just now that it was a real place with a bunker......kinda makes me wanna visit
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greenbrier
---
That’s honestly pretty impressive , on Xbox you cannot go for 1 hour without seeing someone’s name being put up as a warning on the LFG feature that they just scammed another , now constantly seeing this every day makes for an environment that has 0 trust. I imagine on your platform that has no LFG feature and thus not being exposed to the toxicity as blatantly as other platforms ,that it makes for a smoother transition in trading
---
Im lvl 91 and still building up cards lol got rifle man all done same with meelee yay. Loving my new toy i got this morning 3* furious tesla rifle its become my favorate to use at SBQ event.
---
I think the obvious answer is to make the gameplay "more challenging" or some stupid shit like that. 
---
It's such a simple, easy to implement thing that I don't get why they didn't want to do it. Maybe to make it more impactful for when you level up a card, but even then, ugh, why.
---
Love these. I've been messing with mixing and matching the Raider/Coal Dust skins for my scavenging Excavator set.
---
It’s easily found at Fort Defiance. 
---
For players that might not know *or players that haven’t done the BoS quest* this it would probably sell.
---
Edit: added text
---
You can wait days for hunter hunted to fill up and nw is full of little kids jumping up and down constantly. Survival was meant to lure the pvp crowd away from the sheep ,what killed it was the sheep insisting that they be able to get the added xp without the worry of being killed .pvp should go back to way it was in the beginning minus the slap damage. And who thought that removing camp damage in survival just didnt listen to the players that actually participated in pvp and enjoyed it . Someone runs and tries to hide in there camp covered with turrets you should be able to smash that shit to get at them
---
I’ve been having major issues with it to the point where I scrapped mine. 
---
I’ve only ever used it in survival to lay siege to another’s camp. That was literally the only time it was worth it for me.
---
Maybe for their birthday I can have my money back
---
The raid is a failure because it sucks, not because it's difficult. Endless spawns, no real boss, boring mechanics and worthless rewards.
---
It's the most pathetic attempt at end game content I've ever seen.
---
The fact you risk everything just running it was the kiss of death.
---
I have every type of PA so you're not the only one
---
Oxhorn upgraded to a T-51b with a Jetpack and Calibrated Shocks. 
---
He’s got a Legendary Instigating Combat Shotgun, A Quad Gauss Rifle, and a Bloodied Explosive Laser Rifle that just sits in his stash box for whatever reason (I don’t think he realizes how perfect that is for a sniper character).
---
I meet this high level play right when vendors came out, they asked if I wanted anything and they told me to pick out a gun from all of their 3 star legendarys that were for sale for a couple thousand caps. I picked out a lvl 50 two shot combat shotgun even though I was like level 30 , and I use it now. They also gave me like 600 .45 round for my lever.
---
Beat me to death with a boxing glove and then ate me. 
---
It was awesome!
---
Yes it's worth it I play with someone who just modded the same weapon and now uses it as their secondary weapon, they are over level 100
---
dude, it was at my camp, i logged in and out within a minute, gone! wanted to make a clip with ps4 share, but recorded only the last 7 seconds. i run pacifist 24/7 and no pet died. i have my camp at flatwoods and a deathclaw or mirelurk king should have no issues with low lvl animals there. it's broken! and i'm mad as fuck right now
---
It is kind of fun to play with for a short period, but really not useful.  I had fun during the free week dropping arty on new players fresh from the Vault and watching them scatter.  Then I scrapped it.
---
Because you need to do some actual damage on the SBQ. This fight is not handing out participation trophies.
---
is this a suggestion or a request?
---
It happens lmao
---
How do you do 30k plus a swing? My bloody dcg with swing speed and the perks for swing speed, and unarmed maxed, is putting at 1 ish k. 2 k if you have nukashine. I've seen in the past people output that damage but I haven't touched even close
---
Dude, I gave up trying for that exact reason. Then I stumbled on a deathclaw and said "ok, let's try this again". That was almost three months ago, and he's still kicking. 🤷‍♂️
---
Agrees if your not pumping out alot of damage u wont get a thing . I figured that out after 1 fight during scorched earth instead of pking my mini gun i only had my shotgun and didnt put the perks in b4 the fight and even tho i hit the bitch a shit ton i didnt get shit from it but from that i leared to keep that gun in my shit box and just drag eather my railway rifle and my 3* tesla rifle or my mini gun with any of thoes 3 i do a shit ton of damage and get all rewards.
---
PA weight cards make all mine 1.2 pounds so I have them all on my character, I think I’m up to 8 right now. 
---
Save weight parts wise by placing parts on a frame. Can also be mixed types on one frame which will make those parts only weigh 10 pounds max. So 8 would only weight 80 pounds even without perk cards. 
---
More parts add more frames!
---
I think mole rats and radscorps can sense tremors in the ground or something. The second they burrow I’m spotted.
---
Build high enough into stealth and Yao guai will never find you unless they run straight into you. Agility in the mid to high 30s and a harder to detect suit does the trick. Your DPS with a bloodied rifle will also be high enough to kill a trio in a couple seconds, so that helps too.
---
You should be able to shift from melee/sniper to melee/heavy gun without too much problem.  I did starting around L60
---
I started as a melee sniper, now melee/heavy.  
---
I did the secondary specialty switch for flying things - the executioners combat rifle that I used to take down my first (L50) SB was woefully inadequate for L65s (or the pairs/trios you sometimes find).
---
An AA308 and either Resolute veteran or a Troubleshooters gatling are my primary heavies.
---
Melee is already high strength, so I just swapped a couple other perks around and equipped Stabilized3.
---
Still melee most ground based things, but yogis, mothmen, and SBs get the heavies.  Weight issues keep me in excavator - motion assist servos and optimized bracer each add str boosts, which helps both melee and heavy guns.
---
Counter-point it really doesn't matter they will prioritize what they feel they need to regardless of continuing suggestions.  While I am sure our input is considered, I think you are overthinking it.
---
If you are on PS4 and still want it I just grabbed the plan.
---
22k for that AA/FFR? Not to brag but that one of my backups because I'm Bloodied mostly. Didn't think it was worth that much! I hoard decent legendary heavy weapons and can't vend them because they weigh too much and nobody probably wants them. All bloodied heavies apart from 50 cal, many two shot ones, some junkies, quad harpoon and Broadsider that can be really useful. A few explosive LMGs, a bloodied one that's a nuisance to get ammo for. I kinda want to sell some but I'd probably go to max caps and have to mess around with mules, which seems like a hassle
---
What did they do to shotguns in the last nerf? You mean the explosive nerf? I've noticed in Prime Cuts when letting other tag the creatures that explosive doesn't do much damage. Could be the person's build but I've seen quite a few just plinking explosive bullets off high level foes while I'm cutting right through them
---
Do you know where they addressed this? Curious to read it myself.
---
you mean your camp was next to where the creature spawns? because even if you're at flatwoods, a deathclaw would have to trek all the way from wherever it spawns.
---
imagine taming one in the bog. it'd have to fight several SBs before it got to the puny creatures in the forest.
---
Which is kind of unfortunate, there is value in people clearing out the trash mobs so the heavy hitters can take down the SBQ.
---
Hey I get it, it's not everybody's thing but here's a few things I still feel are misunderstood. 
---
1. There have been no confirmed character losses or inventory losses post patch 13. Furthermore previous to that people were trying and failing to recreate the bug so it wasn't as big a problem to the general population as it was made to seem. On top of that they can give the items back now and have done to the people who lost their characters and inventory.
---
2. Stability has been greatly improved after patch 13. I get it, myself and plenty of others had a rough time in the first few weeks of this raid but to call what it is now compared to what it was not at the VERY LEAST a great improvement stability wise would be a disservice to the dev team. Sure there are still a few problems (looking at you VAULT DOOR) but it's a far cry from what it was.

3. Wasted Resources. This one gets me when I hear people are spending all these resources. Our team is DROWNING in bulk ammo scraps and improved repair kits on top  of ridiculous amounts of stimpacks radaways and gunpowder. If you're going into the vault and running through 100 stimpacks and thousands of rounds of ammo you probably need to reevaluate you're build in terms of damage and survivability, This is endgame high level content designed to test builds and teamwork I know that's not everybody's cup of tea but it is what it is. I know builds are different and people want to use the automatic death machines like the handmade or similar fast firing guns but there are more efficient and effective ways to clear mobs in the vault that don't waste thousands of rounds of ammo and since most of them are there just to distract you from the task at hand and can be really ignored in some part it's easy to save ammo in a lot of cases as well. I run a gatling gun and MAYBE use 500 rounds per raid and maybe 10 nuke colas or stimpacks depending on the team's shared perks.
---
Tldr I get it's not everybody's favorite thing in the world but if you haven't tried the raid post patch 13 you're complaining about mostly resolved issues and the "resource drain" is more an issue of your team or individual loadouts and builds than anything else. This is high level raidISH content come prepared to Adapt your playstyle to overcome.
---
I actually do damage. It just people kill it too fast
---
I'm doing one hand mellee. Its tricky with the bigger things that can take a few hits but it's not bad for anything smaller than a scorchbeast
---
They added the SBQ and SB to the mounts some time ago but no plans yet are dropped so I doubt they will just go away. 
---
I see both as a quest in the new dlc to get and kill.
---
My first character is a bloody melee and handmade. I just made a second character that I'm doing not bloodied, so what's your build looking like for it? Or any tips, because I don't really know what I'm doing with it so far to make it tanky for the future (he's level 20 ish now, bloody is 120. Still perfecting the bloody but don't really know what else to do unless I run full unyeilding)
---
Yeah same it's by far the better of the 2 regular armors
---
Nah, it was in reference to p2p trading when not wanting to sell, mark it as 25K and hope they get the hint
---
Only casuals want that gear. I already have a full set of bloodied strength unyielding wood, there's nothing better. The solar and thorn are both garbage.
---
PA is for players who don't have real gear.
---
As much as the market will bear.
---
so far i had a deathclaw, a mirelurk king, 2 megasloths and a yao guai and all disappeared into thin air. i have my camp opposite side to green lodge in flatwoods, so them being attacked and killed and me pacifist 24/7 can be ruled out. it's a bug and so many ppl exp it, told Beth, but still nothing :( just mad as fuck right now...however, thx for your add dude
---
Lion Statues?
---
You seem to be the one wearing oversized shoes.
---
Sorry but what does that men
---
Pretty sure I’ve seen SB heads on people’s wall. But even still, why would it be so hard to believe that those mounts don’t come from dead SB we find laying around after the raiders and settlers are around
---
me too...and after my pet is gone for the 5th time i doubt i will ever return to fo76 again...so incredibly mad right now ffs
---
I just found that out today while playing. Put on the high lvl parts that i couldnt wear and when it desapwned it was only the chassis weight and i was mind boggled lol
---
Not to bum you out, but gladiator is really underpowered. Thankfully you can spec into slugger or iron fist easily. If you like melee stealth, gauntlet builds are super strong. You can kill a sheepsquatch or lvl 80 scorchbeast in one punch with a bloodied gauntlet and a decent build.
---
Are you 65 sending back warm soup? Jesus...
---
Nice. Well done.
---
Sounds like you arent reaching the damage threshhold.  Take a look at your build/weapons and see if you cant streamline things to dish out more damage.
---
Floaters, flat worms mutated by the fev, nasty creatures
---
I have always thought it would be nice if the CAMP device would do repairs and simple mods to allow small portable camps.
---
two birds in a bush is the price
---
But when I find them for 100 a piece I buy 2 or 3 of each serum they have, and put them in my machine. Some people buy a few just to hit the daily caps from vendors real quick. They sell for like 500 a piece there I believe
---
dude, the creature made it already to my camp! all of them i mention WERE at my camp! 4 times they diappeared and vanished after a bit of time, and today was gone after just one log in. was at my camp, patroling after it arrived! log out and in again, pet gone! it doesnt matter where you tame it, as long as it makes it to the camp and arrives there
---
Created by the EPA, it's backstory was cut content from fallout 2.
---
I guess I won't sell it then
---
Oh yeah. I know. Going for a ninja type character. I do switch into Slugger sometimes though. 
---
I don't mind the power trade off for a little more speed too much though.
---
No problem. Also, it might be worth trying moving your camp device far away from your structures. It's possible the tame is clipping through them to oblivion. If you even want to try again, that is. 😕

Wow 1 comment of someone who has done it lol. I'm on xbox, my crew an 8 run it every day. I should have my full strangler heart set by the end of dead in the water (I missed the first round of raids as I was on holiday)
---
i bet to you even a turd looks like princess peach...sry for not being interested in crap like yours ,)
---
criticizing the game for being broken and every roach is coming out of their hole to give me lemming nonsense lmao
---
Leeeeeeerrrroooooooyyyyyy Jaaaaaannnnkkkkkiiinnnsss
---
Since you know it's bugged, continuing to try it until you know it's been patched is a damned fool's errand.  
---
And yet...
---
&gt;I already have a full set of bloodied strength unyielding wood, there's nothing better
---
comment disgarded.
---
again, I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure they have to make the trek back every time you log in.
---
I am glad, not because you’re jealous but because it’s excellent:)
---
I had gotten the gist of the BOS story in 76 but Oxhorn's latest video filled in the gaps of all the details I had missed. Most of the time, I'm too busy scavenging or fighting to read every terminal and note. Oxhorn is the Wasteland's Messiah.
---
its hilarious but also super nice not having to be constantly thumped myself to find out what happened.  thank you ox!
---
Yeah that's a great deal, I've seen bids move the price up to 25k multiple times
---
Fool you once, shame on you.  
---
Insanity
---
Alright thanks !
---
Climb to the top of surveyor towers and look out, there will be a button to push which discovers multiple new map locations markers. This is better than walking.
---
Thx
---
It's cool, not everyone is smart enough to min max. Enjoy your shitty PA build.
---
not all of the ones disappeared were gone after just one day! but still...
---
I put them on my PA and they seem fine.
---
How where they bugged?
---
I’m on Xbox unfortunately
---
Any chance you can help me? I really want to complete the raids on expert for the mask. I can familiarize myself with the steps so I won’t be useless in the road:)
---
now i got what you mean...no dude, they usually spawn in with your camp
---
If you come across them hold onto them and message me and I’ll pay good caps for them
---
its coming in 2020, it was mentioned in the last inside the vault
---
by their wording its gonna be the perk loadout system this reddit heavily favored.
---
I actually don’t know. I was giving someone the plans and they said they were bugged and when looking in here I’ve seen a few posts a while back about them glitching or people not being able to access the dome.
---
p.s. unfortunately still truth in it ffs^^
---
I see people selling them in their CAMPS all the time usually around 4k.
---
Ok yea I didn’t see any problem with them. Just had someone in game tell me they were bugged. Thanks!
---
We know, we've complained, Bethesda don't listen. Or they give half arsed replies and then release features intended for the game in the atom shop
---
But I agree with you! The system is a mess. I hope they actually read this and change it
---
Bummer, that's usually the way it seems to go. The person with something you need always seems to be on a different platform. 🤨
---
Nothing personal but this same shit has happened to you more the once more then twice more then 3 times think you need to stop taming for now and find something else to do with ur time.js
---
i dont even use the pa and i ahve it. i run a sentinel assasin set.. tard.
---
If it worked yes, but it doesn't so no. I think I have one if you want it on XB1. Or like someone mentioned, you can pick it up in Fort Defiance.
---
I mean, it's more of a suggestion because the more we ask for, the more Bethesda might think "hm that's a good idea, let's hit the drawing boards"
---
Yep tired of going camp to camp to find them
---
Yeah, I am over thinking it. I've just seen alot more suggestions than normal this week, and since some of the items and ideas they are working on that got pushed back were ideas that came from the community, it seems they are taking alot of our ideas
---
He was at a Meat Cook with me on Thursday. First time I've seen a YTer in game.
---
Hehe thanks. Made me lol
---
No, by my logic you shouldn't buy something and expect it to be something else.....
---
I agree completely.
---
You have every right to feel the way you do. Ignore the brain dead downvotes. If they pulled their head out Bethesdas arse for 5 mins to see the damage they've done to the goodwill and mood of our community they'd see the light
---
Unfortubely they'd rather stay silent and thank Bethesda for fixing issues that should have been fixed before launch. Not gonna thank Bethesda for fixing an incomplete and broken product
---
Lots of history at the Greenbrier. Uncanny Caverns is based off of Lost World Caverns outside of Lewisburg and resembles the Visitor center and the actual cave in certain spots
---
I've seen one guy on xbox and he runs in our group now because the guy said he couldn't find people who wanted to run it lol their loss
---
They can do this.  They are waiting until a bunch of people quit then they can make a huge announcement to bring people back in thus extending the life of the game.     They need to have a reason to do it.  And being nice isn't a reason in their eyes.
---
I have every work station plus PA station at my camp.
---
"I love this game and I'm going to tell everyone about how great it is. Don't buy it tho because only I enjoyed it and I know its mostly shite"
---
Gr1mTheReaper - 29/9/19
---
Rest in peace my child
---
gbnf
---
I just realised its bolt action so u fortunately cant make it automatic:(
---
So that's why everyone is getting legendary shovels? To bury the old game?
---
I tried looking it up but found loads of people asking for de ranking perk cards. But I believe it was one of the past inside in the vaults, maybe a month or so ago. If not, then I must have misread, but I've been not buying certain cards again so I can de rank them eventually
---
I'm not at my limit. So I'm saving it all for the purveyors sale!!
---
I've spent so many hours of my life watching MATN videos, his "kill every thing" challenge in Fallout 3 was pure comedy gold. I've watched that series twice now lol
---
Feels bad man. Still it's good for lower level events and stuff, you won't be wasting good ammo.
---
Hell yeah. There aren't many YouTubers or twitch people who are playing 76, it's still getting shit on by people. So it's nice to see that the streamers community is still there, somewhere, in Appalachia
---
Buy it
---
The game is good *now*, but it wasn’t at launch. Those who pre-ordered it felt scammed and never returned to it. My point was that pre-ordering can lead to disappointment. Wait for the reviews so you know what you’re buying.
---
Got it, you have shit gear for killing noobs at workshops and you enjoy playing boring missions for gear you don't use.
---
Lol saying sentinel assassin like it's good, you clearly don't trade much.
---
My heavy gunner has a F/E Gatling and AA/FFR 50 for the vault raids. I use B/FFR for normal use. I’d stay bloody for the raids if the rad damage wasn’t so high in everything besides Washout.
---
Anti armor is pretty popular for players that don’t want to do bloody or junkie for whatever reason. They trade reasonably well in trading circles. Furious is much better on high hp enemies, but AA is slightly better on enemies that only require a short burst. Bloody and junkie are way better, but you kinda have to run Rad Sponge for two of the raids, or carry a ton of radaway. Staying bloody is super difficult in Meltdown, and a hazmat suit really isn’t an option with enemies everywhere.
---
The AA gun is actually surprisingly good against bugs. 
---
Switch to a prime receiver on the LMG. Ammo is much easier to produce in quantity.
---
They reduced shotgun explosive damage to a single pellet. Given that explosive damage is a 20% yield and a single pellet usually does far less than 100 damage, you’re barely getting anything from the explosive effect. When all pellets got an extra 20 points from an explosion, it actually added some appreciable damage. Now it’s basically worthless.
---
You need to realign your priorities
---
I'm looking at the greenbrier website now.  Pretty cool.
---
Scorch beasts best not ever desapear scorched earth is the only worth wild thing for us end gamers to do.
---
I think thats probably a good idea poppunk
---
I run shadowed on everything. IMO the extra small bit of DR isnt going to help me survive when an enemy spots me and I'm at 15% health
---
First Bethesda game?
---
I love that you bitch and moan about how "us early adopters" dealt with problems for "many, many, many, many months" ...
---
Yet you quit the game after a month? 
---
Which one is it?
---
No they do not the bees do.
---
They’re no released yet unless the person was one of the ones that went into the developer room and took plans... 
---
The reason is the mounts we do have come from hunting down that creature. 
---
Kinda lame if you have to find a dead SB or SBQ and not fight it to get it.
---
Some people take them to vendor them. :/
---
true. and wont disagree. but on the other hand this is what fallout gamers always need to do on the bugs. find workarounds or dont do stuff at all...again, although you are right somehow, it just shows once more how pathetic and lousy bethesda is as a company, what a bunch of a**holes and on top greedy considering atom-shop on a broken shit game, when bugs dont get serious patches in a full year! but have you do workarounds and crap...
---
truth. but still, BGS is a bunch of pathetic incompetent a**holes
---
Things are planned out and executed months in advance of when we get it, even if they did listen to us (lol) it wouldn't matter.
---
Can I use a spear as a decoration man? I was thinking the same thing!
---
They should make everyones pets immune to damage like Gram
---
Wait till meat week is over. I sold a standard tenderizer for 5000 caps the week after the first meat week. I put it at that price as a joke thinking nobody would buy it, but it sold within an hour of putting it in.
---
You might be interested in "[I see your 2x1 and 1x1 utility CAMPs and raise you with this cosy but fully functional 2x1 one (and 1x1 version)](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a1vt4p/i_see_your_2x1_and_1x1_utility_camps_and_raise/)" and "[2×2 Tent C.A.M.P. with all workbenches (Step by step guide)](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/2x2-tent-c-a-m-p-with-all-workbenches-step-by-step-guide/)" (these were from before brewing stations were added to the game).
---
I'm also a fan of minimalist CAMP designs. It's possible to fit everything (including fusion generator, decontamination shower, and personal terminal) elegantly into a 2-story 2x2 design. If you don't include a personal terminal and fermenter (and put generators on the roof, or don't include generators at all), I think it's possible to fit all the rest into a 3x1 design.
---
Agreed. This is the game where even the promotional helmets are mouldy. It's an OK game, but Fallout games are supposed to be better than "OK".
---
Good lord... "good bye and thanks for all the ammo"  no drop for you!!
---
Hiya! I'd like to buy a keyboard with no punctuation and no possibility of capital letters. I like a small footprint. Like 8-10 letters max.
---
Can you tell me where you bought yours?
---
Agreed the camp invincibility is ridiculous
---
Not to mention, that access to the beta pretty much showed off the rough state of the game, and what it was going to be. On top of the plethora of beta impressions that littered media outlets. 
---
It was pretty easy to tell how it was going to launch. So that's on him for keeping a pre order.
---
UNTIL the whole world changes when the wastelanders arrive
---
Yeah they did say that the original story would still be there for new players and the new Wastelanders story would be there as well.
---
I was at the one in the Ash Heap the other day, and it failed, there were about 8 other players there, and after it failed I walked up to the Welch Station and got attacked by 2 primal crickets. I think that enemies are spawning too far away from the center of the event.
---
It's weird how some players get crippled by lack of weight management.
---
It's like digital hoarders, they think everything has value and can't recognize what is worthless.
---
yes, seen this a few times.
---
Nope. No it wasn't. Pre order was all that was needed. 
---
I had zero dollars down on my pre order. Still got beta access.
---
There is a perk card that reduces the cost of repair on PA and makes it cost almost nothing.
---
Interesting, yeah, on PC we don't have the gamertag that we can change on the fly, and our CD-keys are account-bound not disc bound so your sins stays with you. I literally have only heard about people being scammed, but never been scammed myselfm
---
They are obvioulsly karma farming
---
Do you remember how many bullets you spent? It makes a big difference?
---
This bug is known for ages.
---
I'm worried it'll be farmers showing up to let me know a settlement is under attack...
---
I also keep a few spare frames on me at all times to leave at people's camps that I don't like. 
---
Set up at the Whitespring clubhouse with missile turrets so you steal all my kills? I will block your crafting tables with multiple empty PA frames so you can't use them.
---
With Preston’s Great Great great great grand pappy leading the charge
---
If naive Fallout/ES fans hadn't assumed this game would be bug free, they would have better managed their expectations and not pulled the trigger on a purchase for something they regretted. 
---
Name 1 Fallout/ES that didn't launch as a buggy mess..... Now ask yourself why you expected any differently and still bought it. Especially considering the beta and the reviews of the Beta clearly showed the state the game was in.
---
If you're on a PC, buy another copy of the game. You can have 5 mule characters on the second account. You can run both instances of the game at the same time. This will give you 4000 more storage.
---
mine did not vanish because being killed.
---
but agree
---
you need to be insane for still playing the game. so welcome to the club
---
Ok thanks. Never used a tesla until 2 days ago. I though it was just the server being terrible.
---
This is made to minimise the development cost and make balance adjustments cheaper and easier to implement. None of what you said is any solution for my needs. The fact we don't share needs doesn't mean your needs or mine are not valid. Not having a proper PvP mode will hinder the playerbase too, because even if you personally remain unbothered, shitloads of people are. Think further than tip of your nose please.
---
I’ve noticed a lot of people at the Bog Primal Cuts just sitting back at the drum and waiting for things to come to them. That just doesn’t work for that event. They get hung up on trees, attacked by other creatures etc. If you wait, you will fail. 
---
I’m not one-shorting anything at that event, but I can kill everything pretty easily solo and finish in plenty of time by chasing down the targets. If people run with me to get them, they’ll get their shots in. If they just want to hang back and wait, tough luck.
---
There is that, my auto-rifle vats char is now level 10 thanks to meat week
---
do i? so i need to realign my priorities rather than Beth fixing and patch serious issues? no dude, you are no simple sheep or lemming. you are a ferking stupid moron
---
My first time at a nuked Whitespring a player desperately tried to get me to come inside so I could tag the mobs and get some materials and XP (except I was terrified it was a trap because of some previous experiences with griefers and opted to die repeatedly outside).
---
Agreed. My favourite build style and my favourite camps I come across are always ones that fit into the setting. They look like they belong.
---
None of this floating fortress trash.
---
I know i was being a bit mean sorry, I do get what you mean, I didn't preorder it myself though 
---
But honestly in my opinion this game had a chance to be something special but the foundation of the systems are fundamentally broken. There are bugs they can't fix, perks that don't work and systems that aren't balanced. They've been patching none stop for a year and I still don't think we are anywhere near where we need to be. 
---
I recently had the chance to purchase fallout 4 VR and the condition the game is in still, is completely broken in some areas. after all this I came to realise the problem with Bethesda is the rot at core of their business stategy. A team of amazing creative artists crippled by the pressure from above them. VERY sad
---
I've played countless hours of this game (76), even purchased a few bits, I've given Bethesda everything as a consumer and instead of rewarding players for loyalty and passion, they've decided to nickle and dime us with overpriced atom crap ported from fallout 4 for disgusting prices.
---
If I had it my way I'd love Bethesda to give us the game we wanted but I feel confident saying that it'll just never happen. I hope I'm wrong though and I eat these words.
---
&gt; just nuke that computer to Oblivion 
---
Where do you think it came from in the first place?
---
Yea when i told my friends that even if you’re not interested in pvp, the game let you get murdered and robbed. Everyone was like wtf is this? But now since they added pacifist mode it’s not an issue any more. If you can deal with the bugs, it’s a fun game.
---
Pick up Egg Head to negate the Intelligence loss.
---
I almost exclusively build at existing locations that feature pre made workbenches. Helps with keeping budget low, and they always just seem to look like they belong where they are.
---
I’ve (and many others) asked for this, let us RANK DOWN our cards!
---
But before Q2 2022, thanks!
---
This is GRRRRRRAFTON'S MAYOR!
---
I dont use symbols all the time ass hat and its my choice to make. Have fun down voting me :p
---
Nobody assumed it would be bug free, even Todd warned us about it.
---
Not only that but nobody knew what the game was until launch,its very easy to say what you're saying with the knowledge you have now. Bugs are a different league to broken mechanics
---
Bugs - malfunction of a working systems
---
Broken - wrongly built game system
---
I ordered it through Amazon, which takes your money when you pre order. If you did it through BGS own launcher … it also took your money. Unless you refunded after beta, your money was already taken.
---
Neither of these services offer or offer you a product without first paying. That includes the beta, if you got it free then you either got the code from a friend who pre ordered the beta and got exta keys. You paid just for a beta key, which was a thing from scalpers on ebay for around 10$. 
---
Either way money was needed and that is and was a fact. So again unless you canceled your order .. you paid if you pre ordered :|. If you don't believe check your statement.
---
So the basic fact is: you had to pay to get into the beta or you mooched off a friends code. Either way money was being paid to the beta :|.
---
Watoga hs cafeteria is also a good spot, they have surgical trays instead of the plastic cafeteria trays.
---
I dought it will change that drasticaly.
---
You had a whole pvp mode. It failed from lack of interest.
---
Your solution it to make another pvp mode? Makes perfect sense right?
---
The majority of FO players dont give 2 hoots about pvp.
---
Your "needs" are in the minority. I dont agree they need to waste development time on another failed mode.
---
I suggest going to play a more pvp focused game.
---
+1
---
Everyone over looks this workshop. Junk+aluminum. Love it.
---
Its not crippling at all, just get to destinations more slowly than normal, and i do t care about the fast travel aspect of it. Never gonna pay caps just to get places id rather walk anyways. I like to have spares lol
---
Yep. Thats what it is
---
It's not a "rather" or an "or."  You both need to reassess some shit.  Maybe go outside, make some friends... maybe get a hug
---
I love this. That's so kind of that player.
---
lol^^
---
Pretty obvious isn't it? I played for a month excluding the beta. Yet been on the fourms again since the beta. I mean did you not use the forums around launch and see the vitril? No. Then hush as you didn't need to go through it and if you did … is your point I played it for a month while others did for months and said months instead of "month" to ease your narrow mind?
---
They definitely adjusted damage. Tbh I think it was broken before, I ran 40 hp and never died. Now I die regularly.
---
I just run broken armor since I'm stealth anyways.
---
Lmao oh god thats pretty good.
---
Sadly on ps4 til i get the rest of my parts lol
---
I get that. It's hard to know if someone will grief you.
---
You'll have to mod it to a non scope.
---
Technically, you could add Chally's Feed to that list.
---
LOL well, I guess that's one way to interpret Good Samaritan.
---
Different clothes and a mutated pink mini-elephant for a temporary companion while you're drinking Nuka-Shine, would be some crazy fun.
---
You want the magnification of the scope without looking through it? That's like wanting to poop without having to actually walk to the bathroom. Some people can pull it off, I'm sure, but the result is probably not the desired effect.
---
I'm level 109 and got demolished doing Primal Cuts in the Savage Divide today. 
---
Hey level 128 guy! How about coming down off that raider pole and actually coming to where the bears are?!?
---
This has been in the game since launch. Although it used to be way worse. (More often) . Sometimes the containers just are all empty. Just cross your fingers for a rare plan at the end. You'll also get a few ores then too.
---
See no. 
---
I walked into EB Games Canada. Here's how it works. 
---
"I'd like to pre order Fallout 76"
---
"Would you like to put any money down on that today?"
---
"No"
---
"Okay, just so you're aware, on launch day we fulfill full paid pre orders first, so if there are limited copies, your pre order may not be fulfilled on launch day"
---
"Ok"
---
"Here's your pre order receipt, the beta key is on the bottom, but you have to register it through the Bethesda website"
---
I've never once, for any game, put money down on my pre order. My beta key or eallrly access key get printed on my receipt. 
---
So no. No money was paid for access. You're wrong. I'm right. Feel free to call any EB Games to confirm.
---
You see, there's other outlets to get games other than Amazon or a company's launcher.
---
"If naive Fallout/ES fans hadn't assumed this game would be bug free"
---
I don't think a single person who has played any BGS games for any period of time expected the game to be shipped bug free. The issue was and still is the bugs that are there … have been there since 2015 when FO4 was released and STILL are not fixed …. How is that okay? It's not.
---
Every game that is released over it's predecessor should not ship out with even more bugs and issues than the game that came before it while using almost the exact same framework; period.
---
People did expect better … they were promised better. If you're saying it's okay for these promises to be made and not delivered because "we know this gaming company sucks" then .. well. Nothing will ever get better, ever and people will just sit content with garbage.
---
I do this sometimes, too, especially if I pick up a weapon I know I won't use. Glad you had a cool interaction and got a good gun out of it!
---
You're probably right, I'll add it up there.
---
BIG BOI! I love it. That sounds like an awesome weapon.
---
I have 40+ strength and just keeping food on me stretches the limits. You are severely crippled if you never fast travel. You're wasting most of your time between locations.
---
Multiple PA is really pointless, they are all essentially the same other than the raid pa.
---
Excavator used to have a purpose but that was heavily diminished by backpacks.
---
Just keep the highest stat set and scrap the rest.
---
Are you using the automatic barrel?

This is what I refer to as the "damage desync" bug. It seems to be caused by hitting multiple enemies at the same time, too quickly. The server and client seem to get out of sync, so your client shows the damage you should be dealing, but the server lost track of one of your previous hits, and rejects every projectile hit from that point onwards (your client will keep resetting back to what the server says the target's health should be). Only melee hits will work after triggering the bug, until you leave the server.
---
You basically need to slow down your rate of fire to something like one shot per second (or even one shot every two seconds, depending on the server's responsiveness) whenever you're hitting multiple targets with a Tesla gun.
---
I could use that code haha
---
It's great! I've never had a legendary drop come close to those stats, personally.
---
If you still got it ill take it
---
This is the best. Sometimes I'll find loot bags people have left behind with plans I don't know yet, and I'm level 145.
---
These days I usually will deck out some low levels if my stash is getting full.
---
The survival mode was working fine until they made the great borking aka second damage cap limit and surrounding changes.
---
They adjusted the survival mode to fit the general public, that killed it for everyone. Previously, it was niche, but it was active.
---
Basically your point is that our needs are invalid because we're minority. No other game scratches my competition itch the way Fallout competition does. Im disinterested in games other than postApo online PvP games. This is one. We had something we held dear and it was first fucked over to seem more approachable for the majority, then after failing to deliver what was expected from it, turned down. 
---
They already have all the pieces needed to implement my suggestion and the needs for that aint great, while it solves some structural problems as well as giving thousands of us PvPers reason to stick to game more. This is not a waste of time, this is time-saving and money saving way to grow it, because they get to playtest new stuff cheaply without influencing the economy permanently.
---
and that ?, gave away somewhere ?, for a mule would always be good
---
I’ve had about 10 pets and they all only lasted a few days to a few weeks. Some are laying dead on the ground when I log on, others just disappear.
---
I just tame whatever happens to be at a random spawn whenever I check one, knowing it’ll be gone soon. I’ve stopped hunting for specific pets.
---
That's just it.... Nothing at all in the bins. I was just being specific on what I look for, sorry if there is any confusion there.
---
Preach. I haven't either, although my 3* bloodied sledgehammer might come close to being as good a drop.
---
You got it my friend
---
Sweet
---
I got a legendary minigun with reduced weight, increased damage per landed shot and 1 other, and haven't gotten any good legendary rifles, whclich is why I'm making the switch lol
---
I've met some really great people through this game. I'm glad you found someone to help you out! Sometimes you just need a Wasteland pal.
---
The Somerset Special? If you take the gunslinger perk early in the game, that little weapon is pretty good for some stealth kills early on. I got up to around LVL 40 before I stopped using it when I was in a pinch.
---
My boyfriend has a sweet fire axe and I'm so jealous lol. High-level players who help low levels are the best.
---
It's so fun to do this. Glad you got some good stuff!
---
Novelty adds value. I rolled an instigating power attack bear fist and got 8k for it.
---
Same here, here’s mine:

I'd love to know if that was actually true. If I got to Game stop and ask to pre order something I am required to pay for it then and there. It's a boutique much like EB as EB is not a place around me. If EB doesn't take money for the pre order than I can see no legit reason they would give you a pre order code. Nor even hold a physical copy/digital code for you. As you'd be not better than a homeless dude walking into a Walmart and asking to preorder a shirt .. but with no money down. It make's zero sense as to why they would do that.
---
If they do in fact do it. That is a unique and rare thing and you must have good friends there seeing they'd be in the market for losing money like that. Ordering a bunch of product because people said they wanted to "pre order" but then never come to pick it up.
---
I guess so.
---
This is awesome--one of the best stories I've heard for sure. Thanks for your service, friend.
---
I've passed up so many safes because of this.
---
I have a full set of both and tested them by slowing irradiating myself and looking at the change in damage resistance numbers.  What I found was that bolstering started kicking in when my health went below 90% increasing damage resistance consistently with each reduction of health by 10% offering the maximum below 10% health.  The vanguards was similar with decreasing resistance with each decrease in health of 10% but limited out when my health dropped below 50%.
---
So basically bolstering offers slower increase in damage resistance but spans the health range from 0% health to 89% health.  Vanguards offers a faster increase in damage resistance with higher health but spans the health range from 50% health to 100% health.
---
Lol I'm not really a pvp guy so I can't recommend which setup to run but that is what I've learned with how the armor effects work.
---
Not in this game. If you want, you can do what I do: carry two weapons, one sighted, one scoped.
---
You had a similar experience to mine! Isn't is so awesome when people help each other out? I know a lot of people are focused on PvP right now, but this game is so much more than that.
---
I'm not sure how to explain this, but I wish objects like campfires didn't have a static X and Z axis, like they follow the contour and bumps of the terrain, so that they don't just float just because the ground is at an incline.
---
That's awesome. I love that mutation; it's my ride or die.
---
Tesla rifle 🤷🏼
---
Yeh it’s a very small group of players who run it, the fact you can lose your whole character put people off, funnily enough.
---
Ayeeee free legendaries are the best legendaries.
---
Sure, but I’ll be living in a 10x10 house due to budget.
---
Nicest thing someone has ever done for me is buy my TSE 10mm Pistol 😂
---
I bought every single one of thoes plans yesterday except charlies feed witch i bought during last meat week.
---
It does count as a nice thing! Lots of random team invites are to initiate PvP, so your experience is a great one.
---
Specialize using a single type of weapon.
---
Honestly, yeah you do. It really helps when you're a low level too. It's almost like a "big brother" deal to carry you through when you do. I'm level 120 bloodied now, and I wouldn't have even chosen that if it wasn't for the help lol my build was god awful back then. Now I'm on a new alt for a high hp build and honestly, alot more people help me out now than back then. So I can see the shift in the community
---
Paying it forward! That's awesome. I'm sure you made someone's day, too.
---
Does he carry the two clock plans?
---
And a farewell to me not playing for a while due to the griefing shits returning to Adventure Mode...until the 50% Purveyor sale and Wastelanders ofc
---
https://youtu.be/EgjNFoqkWeI 
---
This is a combination of full Unyielding +1 strength for each piece, using the unstoppable monster( it does more damage than a bloodied swing speed +1 str DCG. Then mutations, 15 strength, lvl 3 unarmed perk, solar powered, radicool, ninja, covert operative, strange in numbers, revenant,food buffs, fury, nukashine, nerd rage, and adrenaline( although in that video I'm missing solar powered, I was afflicted with blight and I didnt get adrenaline going so you can do probably 50k a swing on the queen and that's how you one shot her :] any questions lmk lol
---
I got the nuka cola clock and the other one from the Responders vendor bot actually.
---
This is awesome, and not one of those nightmare stories of camps being built on top of the drum lol. I love that he built a sniper's nest just for you.
---
Yeah using automatic. I figured as much as its doing too much dmg to quickly to multiple targets the server trips out. Doing 600 dmg+ per hit to everything too much for the game to handle lol.
---
r/choosingbeggars
---
Yeah no problem, man. Heres a free game even though we all had to pay for it
---
I didnt realize this was in r/Fo76 at first! This really confused me in the begining!
---
Yeah normally I'll clear out the area I'm in, find a few locked things an once everything is dead throw the perks on run through an unlock everything. It's a 80 atoms challenge for unlocking 7600 locks. I'm about 67% of the way there.
---
I made a new character a month ago , his name is Reginald Garvey.
---
Great for a commando, really fun.
---
THIS is the coolest thing. I love when the community comes together like this. And that was a really great idea to put free loot and make a sign for it. I might steal that idea lol.
---
Because it is a piddly nitpick that gamers whine about online, like levels aren't easy to come by on this fucking game.
---
I had a lot of this around hmm patch 10-12, felt like this was fixed lately BUT I have mainly been running shotguns so I cant tell for sure.
---
Another phenomenon I've seen since the return of Meat Week is heavy lag getting "quest complete" messages, item rewards and stuff like that. Gameplay isnt that bad, and havent had the damage bug since patch 13, but again havent gone full auto.
---
That's great! Are there other ones I'm missing? I'd like to server hop to see what other camp plans I can get from him that I don't have, but don't wanna jump in vain if I know them all already lol.
---
Lol my thoughts exactly!  Been on servers where a second nuke landed just as we finished the first queen (totally awesome) but never a server where we had 2 at once.
---
Bless. I tried to give Stimpaks to a level 5 yesterday and he said no. :( I have over 300 lol.
---
Holy jesus, I want to know what their carry weight is. But that's awesome.
---
Defiantly agree with the separate stashes....
---
I run non stealth unyielding  commando with a bloodied explosive auto assault rifle. With gun fu, adrenaline, nerd rage, lone wanderer, serendipity, bloody mess, class freak, starched genes and 1 Star covert operative. I usually have 9 points strength to shift to bloodied meat hook or bloodied heavy guns. 
---
I approach most areas crouched, take out what I can till spotted and then just vats Leroy Jenkins style through most areas with ease. Don’t die much and clear most areas pretty quickly.
---
I'm like level 109 and have mine pretty well lined out. I haven't changed it much since about level 90... Maybe you should be better at the game?
---
Glad you got some wholesome content!
---
You miss only Tormentor to drop Queen
---
Let me start by saying I am a bloody unarmed player.  I view the queen battle as a dance between Melee and Ranged players.  Both groups have jobs to do and times when they should switch their focus.  With this in mind, there are a few stages during the fight that we need to aware of.
---
1. Queen Flying:  When she is flying around the ranged people should be hard at work shooting at her.  Try to use enforcer or tenderizer and VATS to cripple her wings to force her to land.  Do not use the perk one gun army during a queen fight as it staggers her and prevents her from landing.  The melee people should be dealing with the adds and be ready with their food and drink buffs and shooting even though you may not be specked for it.  Ranged should not cyrolate (SP) her when she is in the air as this also prevents her landing.
---
2. queen on the ground:  Here is where we change partners (focus) the melee players should get busy on the queen. while when there are adds keep the area around the queen clean of adds so the melee players do not have to break off to deal with them.  Some points from a melee player that ranged people may not know, freezing her on the ground is good,  cyrolate away.  Orbital strikes, explosives in general are worthless and add no damage to the queen.  Worse yet, they blind the melee players making it harder to aim and move, and even find downed players.  Shoot away at the queen if there are no adds, otherwise clean the area.
---
3. queen in the air stationary,  This is a situation where ranged can waste a ton of ammo needlessly.  The goal should be to get her on the ground where ranged have a nice stable target and where melee can work their magic.  Shotguns with enforcer help here to cripple her wings, break her pathing, etc.  I have seen her stuck for minutes and a few blasts from my shotgun she starts flying again.
---
Again it is a dance where the partners have equal but different roles to play.  For the ranged people the melee players help you by reducing the ammo you spend on a run.  For the melee players the ranged help you by clearing the area.  Finally, it does not matter what level a player is, if they are helping in the dance they are welcome, if they are hiding in the bunker, may the fleas of 1000 camels invade their nether regions on the hottest summer day.
---
Bless that level 60. Mole miners suck; I hate them almost as much as I hate mole rats.
---
Seems weird to me because you have perks for aiming an vats. I'd pick one you wana do like if you wana vats or aim more. Then you could swap some perks into other things. My build is kinda similar but I use vats an grim reapers so I just vats an RIP through anything an vats swaps on kills an with refresh perk on kill it's just never ending. Ground an pounder to me just seems meh. If you're good enough you can easily aim at the head as well.
---
Here is the video break down of what I use with my Bloodied FF vats refill handmade instead of the radium hes using tho https://youtu.be/FPEGZaefzKA
---
Me too. FINALLY.
---
Its worse because them being there buffs Queenie even more. Probably increases amount of adds and if they hide inside V9 Queenie doesnt like to land.
---
uhh.. that's not like being sworn to carry your burdens, is it?
---
You might have confused the prime 10mm (pistol) plan with a prime 10mm SMG plan.
---
Oh my god, that's awesome. Also, that glitch sounds like a nightmare. I don't remember hearing about it but yikes.
---
A lot of the nuke silo combat can be bypassed.
---
Hell yeah, that's awesome.
---
I loved those Fallout 4 mods so friggin’ much!
---
I just don't open every locked box I encounter.
---
Ohhhh okay
---
Tried that
---
I seriously hope they have something up their sleeves to fill the void that survival mode left behind. I'm a bit disheartened because I see nothing in the roadmap about it. They are pretty open about upcoming features, don't know why they would leave it out. They even announced survival mode ahead of time, it wasn't some big surprise.
---
They are so open about all the other aspects of the game, so why did they pull the rug out from under survival mode? The nerfs were slipped in with a hotfix for PA, and they pulled the plug very suddenly in comparison to how to implement other changes in the game.
---
JESUS. Their carry weight must be incredible, and I am jealous. That player is a godsend.
---
They tried that with FO4 and it sucked
---
I have t45/t51/t60/ultracite
---
Ah okay, that’s late game though, can’t launch a nuke at level 3-6 though.
---
I'd rather re-run Meat Week then have Bethesda design something new, from scratch, taking away development time for Wastelanders. This is just a fun little community event to end summer. I fully anticipate a Halloween Event of sorts which will be something new for us to do and then we should be heading into Wastelanders.
---
This is one of the main reasons I stopped playing. I’m like level 74 and character is so screwed up it will take until level 120 or so to completely fix, and then to get all the cards I want is probably another 40 levels
---
They said scorchbeasts aren't going away.
---
Bless that level 212. I love that you're still paying it forward. Seriously, it's my favorite part of the game.
---
I’ve been thinking about work cards a lot recently. I think my biggest complaint is that we don’t get cards that we’re even interested in until we hit level 50 when we get to pick them ourselves. There’s some imperfection here.
---
I think a good start would be to allow us to change SPECIAL stats and perk cards separately when we level up.
---
My hero
---
U have them all up top :-)
---
My build is pretty stable, but I didn't min max so I have an efficient use of my perks..  one star damage boost cards give 10% Three star boosters only give 20%. All of my basic weapon damage boosting cards are the one star cards.
---
I have them all
---
Man, we should team up. I'll give you some stuff!
---
They fixed that with patch 13 man lol
---
Yeah it’s a pain and if you put a lot of hours into a character you don’t necessarily want to start again.
---
They said they fixed the power armor bug 6 months ago...
---
no, I double checked that it was SMG before buying it.
---
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
---
Aw, random ammo drops are great. Glad you got a good one!
---
How much or what kind of trade for jetpack?
---
Act ur missing the office chairs.
---
I'd rather hear the Grafton Mayor talk to me all day then hear about another settlement needing my help.
---
ahahahah
---
Wow, he's awesome. Also, your camp sounds cool as hell. A pool? Yes.
---
And metal tables
---
Material cost only
---
you got tenderized my friend
---
Such as?
---
What jet pack do you want?
---
You may have bought the prime for the submachine gun that looks like a Tommy gun? 🤷‍♂️
---
Great, I'll add those too. My buddy just reminded of the metal picnic table and the Starburst clock
---
I just read the notes and can’t see it, have you got a link?
---
I was really hoping that they upgraded the shelves we had to be the displays. Not these lame display cases. Honestly I dont care for them much an hardly use them in my builds.
---
It's like they balanced the game around not being able to do everything all at once? Crazy right?!
---
I LOVE doing this. Sometimes it takes a minute for me to gain the level ones' trust (because I'm over level 100), but I really do love giving them the necessities and showing them around.
---
*You have triggered a crossover event.*
---
Love this! Thanks for being a great Wasteland neighbor.
---
Yes! The Red paint with the coal dust skin go pretty well together too if you just do the torso red. It also looks like theres something that can be done with the coal dust skin and the Ultracite armor but I havent gone too far down that road yet.
---
Id love to see that! Its a shame I missed a bunch of those paints - couldnt find them in the shop.
---
Is that from the token machine at Camden park?
---
*Definitely* not scrip level. If I hadn't just bought an Executioner's Explo I'd offer about 7k, you could get more most likely.
---
They are working with a crazy small team. That's why everything is pushed back. They are gonna work on what they have going anyway. People suggest stuff to just try an help improve the game they like. Nothing wrong with it. Not like Bethesda is gonna pick each suggestion and add it.
---
Didn't even no you could get a jetpack for the PS4, what do you do with the wiring ?  :D
---
Teaming up randompy is scary and risky, but this story is so wholesome. I love that he spent time helping you with your build. Also, I'd die for that Grognak's ax lol. Thanks for sharing!
---
Holy. Damn. That's awesome.
---
X01 does it matter if it’s tricennial or not?
---
I love this--truly a Mysterious Stranger (or Savior!).
---
Good. This oughta be fun.
---
Yeah that doesn’t work at the bog event. There’s different strategies required at each location for sure. My major gripe is the savage divide event. For that event all the creatures can be lured down and funneled making it easy for everyone to get a shot in. The bog event forget it, everything spawns in such a large spread you have to run towards each spawn.
---
I wouldn't recommend the video. It was incredibly frustrating to watch. I've begun to change my opinion on ManyATrueNerd because of it - He kept fake-laughing and raising his voice to cry "Good job Bethesda!, or "It just works!", or complain about how bugged the Vault is when Oxhorn in the background kept trying to explain what was happenning. As others have mentioned they absolutely did themselves no favors by jumping in with a Level 20 character. 
---
I mean sure, I'm not particularly a fan of Vault 94 either but it was only ever a somewhat poor level design that bothered me. Having ManyATrueNerd spend most of the video loudly talking about how he hates it or how buggy it is (When it wasn't a bug in the first place) just drove me insane.
---
This is a great two-part story! Free gun and free mod.
---
Ugh, I’m not a rifle build so that extra weight really sucks. I guess I should keep one in my stash for public events.
---
Such kindness. Thanks for sharing!
---
That used to be possible before the reload-cancel update by shooting first and quickly aiming down sights. I used this technique back then to make the crosshairs persist while aiming down sights.
---
Yeah. Wish we could set individual stash boxes to a thing we want. Like if I want just a gun cabinet an then a junk drawer let me have it. Not this all connected thing. I get the limits of how much you can store but I'd love individual storage.
---
Lol same, friend. Capitalism is tough in the Wasteland. But I love hearing that you help people out! That's still a nice story.
---
Im a cannibal so i have very little food on me but always keep water on me. I just hate the fact that you have to pay caps to fast travel. But may start doing that since i have to go from monongah mine to ams site and thats gonna be a long trek. 
---
Highest stat set i can wear or just thr highest?
---
Wow, what a trade. That's awesome of him.
---
Whew, that's a lot. Sweet.
---
I love this. Also it reminds me I need to redo my camp. Thanks for sharing!
---
I took a 6 months break. Got to lvl 120 before did all the quest an got burned out. Just came back like 2-3 weeks ago an have really been enjoying the new content they added. Its not ALOT but its definitely improved the game.
---
What a gem. That's great.
---
I'll try n get a pic
---
This is...amazing. I am so jealous lol.
---
I got to laugh a bit i was in morgan town earlyer doing the airport event all the scorch kept hopping off the cliff side then died from fall damage. I tottaly lost it couldent stop laughing at the fact they were commiting suicide and i didnt have to kill a single thing.
---
I saw an underground camp the other night and lost it. It was THE coolest camp ever.
---
This is a feature I’d love, but ONLY if they released the desk style terminals. I have to squint just to read a sentence on the one we have right now.
---
Hell yeah, Marsupial is the best. What a nice gift!
---
Honestly, yes. Workshop PvPing sucks (unpopular opinion, I know).
---
My thoughts exactly. I am not asking for more space just different cabinets. I have no idea on the backend solution  but with display cases and vending machines I would think it is possible. Just classify the containers as vending without a sale option.
---
he has a bloodied explosive lazer rifle... one of his viewrs gave him op weapons and he dosent use them
---
That's so cool, right??? And I think there's even more little things to be discovered like that! =]
---
I’d only seen 2-3 in about 500 hours so I was thrilled that he showed me how to do it.
---
Who is this we you keep referencing?
---
Just display rack for the moment.
---
Same here. And I have a million plans I already know, so I'll offer them to people if they're interested.
---
And glue on some runs.
---
LOL all right! Glad you got the sale.
---
Lol, I'm thinking that the Blue Screen for you would be a different kind of BS for me :)
---
Wasn't in the notes I don't think I'm pretty sure it was a comment by the Bethesda's account on this subreddit addressing the character loss and what was done about it. That and there have been stability patches with patch 13. It's a really far cry stability wise from what it was during the first few weeks it's much smoother.
---
Happy Birthday Bathesda 🎂
---
lol true that.  I should have been more clear.  I meant every enemy in the area knows exactly where I am.  rocking 28 agil on a bloody unarmed all sneak perks.  after I hit one they all pinpoint.  it feels like the agility bug from 4 but I'm no expert
---
I really love it. I started back in March and knew nothing about builds, but I hoard stuff so I'm max strength. Now I'm running quasi-bloodied literally so I can have a ton of carry weight. It's also useful if I see someone getting overrun by enemies and I can one-shot them all to help them.
---
It was back when bethesda didnt care about dupers and you could buy TSEs for cheap. I still appreciate it just as much but just saying.
---
I still have it in my stash box waiting for me to make a power armour build. I try to be generous when trading to kind of pass on the kindness
---
It's tricky but super worth it if you can make a nice build down there.
---
I wish TSEs were more accessible tbh. Thanks for passing on the kindness!
---
How is an explosive tesla any better anyways? It doesn't chain like a normal tesla does.
---
Yeah that would probably work. Maybe one day they will do something like that but honestly they are working with such a small team now its probably never gonna happen unless they make a revamp to stash. They are even having a hard time just finding a way to increase stash to a flat 1k or a bit more. I think a flat 1k space would be plenty for everyone.
---
Unless that’s not a type
---
Maybe they could have something that you carry with you that could be used to repair armor and weapons, like some kind of repair kit
---
/S
---
Idk I dont have an explosive one. But my guess is because the demo perk an would add a decent amount of extra dmg. But mines already hitting for 600+ just as a bloodied so idk how much more you need.
---
I see the tenderizer weapon at 2k caps at player vends.
---
BEElieve ftfy
---
They are largely over rated now honestly. The damage isnt great and the accuracy is horrible. However, they are the most fun weapons to use due to the pure chaos of putting that many explosions down range
---
Tricentennial is atom shop. That cant be traded. I can mod the xo1 for 5 violet flux
---
I’m only up there because I’m a sniper and get 2 shot by Yao’s. Even then I dump tons of rounds at them. And 9/10 I’m the only one with long scopes to see them.
---
I love the explosive effect lol. But yeah, I've heard the damage was nerfed. :(
---
I don’t even know what that is
---
Do you have any explosive weapons?
---
Check what kind of prime ammo you can craft. That might help figure things out.
---
I resisted for a long time and thought those guys were nuts lol.....but finally took the plunge and am loving it.  The person above gave some great advice on it.  I also run barbarian under strenght.  Maxed it adds +4 damage resistance per special point of strenght (maxes at +80 damage resistance).  With it maxed and with the unyielding buffs its easy to get the +80 added resistance.  Also mixing some pieces of bolstering armor can really buff your damage resistance up if you know your going to be taking some hits.  There is also another damage resistance card similar to barbarian under agility too.  Also like the person below said the adrenal reaction is amazing for increased damage out put.  A lot of it is about strategy and making your plan for taking out mobs to avoid being over ran.
---
2 minutes after the hour. There’s a timer in the top corner.
---
I take part in alot of SBQ events thease days and i use my 3* Furious tesla rifle and my 3* furious Heated Super Sledge.
---
It always starts on the hour and every hour :)
---
Lol ok well Google that but I dont have the caps room. Give me a couple hours and I'll mod it for 500c. That work for you?
---
his build is shit  and his weapon is shit to .
---
I'm selling the plan mods. Not the tenderizer itself. But thanks for the input
---
Legendary shovels are the most satisfying weapons in my arsenal. You haven't lived until you've cleared West-Tek with a shovel. Shovel with pride.
---
I have one Suppressor's lever-action rifle. I'm running bloodied mostly now, though, and I know BEs go like crazy.
---
Is ut the same fir every server?
---
yes
---
In your stats what does it say your charisma is at? I dont use herd mentality and I cant remember the -/+ effects for it. But sounds like junkies effect or the mutation is bugged.
---
thanks
---
I feel ya. But in a positive way to give hope. Yeah that sounds cheesy but people thrive and seeing their ideas become plausible and tangible things. I’m not above or below this. I’ve made many good and bad ideas and it’s good to see people wanting in a corporal way make a difference and not just be another player without a voice. 
---
A lot of people expect the Devs to make a post and say their fixing 200+ bugs tonight and whatnot. Sadly that’s not going to happen at least like that.  Hell many of the good ideas are immediately downvoted into the shadow realm. Because these ideas are distracting the devs. When in reality that’s only happened a few times good or bad.  
---
Ideas help distract US from time to time. Which is a good thing as wel.
---
Pretty much. Devs read from a script and do what they are told. And if they do a good job they get time to do add something they personally want.
---
Yeah. Even though my tag says ENCLAVE I’m more of a responder lol. I love helping people. I met this low lvl. (I forget lvl) but I told them to follow and took them to my camp and pulled all my plans I was selling and just dropped all of them ..except the ultracite ones. I saw a guy looking at some vending machines by Whitespring station at a camp and bough him a Gatling gun just out of randomness lol
---
On my pip boy it says +4 CHR when in a team. Herd gives you +2 to all special points when in a team which is why I got it
---
welcome aboard...enjoy your trip!!
---
500 caps sounds good!
---
Ouch
---
Built my camp, gave me guns, and still we play together everyday, since I was lvl 20 now I’m lvl 131
---
Fun fact. EB Games is GameStop. Just in Canada. 
---
Other fun fact. "if they in fact do this" they do. Hell you can even pre order online, but need to pay $5 for online pre-orders minimum. Which you can verify on their website here.
---
[EB Games](https://www.ebgames.ca/Help/Index?section=HelpCenter%2FPreorderOnlinePickupInStore)
---
So, if I can pre order for 5 bucks online, is it really all that big of a stretch that I can pre order with no money down in store? And don't need some friend to pull some shady deal?
---
If not. I'll gladly prove you wrong. I'm pretty sure I have my FO76 receipt at home. Or maybe I'll just walk over to EB Games after work and ore order some random title to stick it in your smug, doubting face.
---
A cool down on the stagger attack would be nice
---
People have been forced to move camps before. It’s not out of the realm of possibility.
---
Who the F is Oxhorn?
---
you've paid for the game once and expect them to give you all these updates and dlc for free..greedy little sh\*t..they have to make a living in order to keep this game going.
---
Simple request denied.
---
The VT vault boy statue, short columns, and the Greek letter set are the first ones that come to mind.
---
This is already a thing. 
---
There’s quite a few options in the atomic shop and a few in game too.
---
get your facts straight...the moldy helmet thing is nothing to do with bethesda but a licenced partner..google it before bashing them..buy hey ho..it's the internet where people are quick to judge.
---
Sorry, I read your title as having an explosive tesla instead of a bloodied one.
---
You are too pure for this world. Thanks for being awesome.
---
Can we just add all the crafting ones to fking passive?  Good grief so tired of swapping back and forth.
---
It Is one of the few enemies that can kill you. Leave it be. If you want Nerf, you have deathclaws. There Is practically no danger in this game: only thing that kills me Is when I miscalculate heights and drop from a high Cliff, or when I try to kill a mirelurk queen without crippling her first.
---
Yay for helping and friendship! I play with a friend I made a few weeks ago and it's really fun. We hop on the mic and chat about our days and such.
---
Like they pushpins at train stations....it just places it on the map - you still have to walk to it the first time.
---
That would be fun just call it “wargames” I’d grind that out for days if done properly, a tactical/stealth multiplayer mode would be fun
---
I go around and help people reduce their stash size by killing them and taking their junk for myself.
---
I finally got a cool bug where my Tesla didn’t have to reload.
---
Oh, well damn. Idk then. Sounds to me like it's just a bug. Idk if this helps but when I run on my team there is one of us that shares magnetic personality 1-2* so the rest of us damage builds can share 2-3* perk cards for each other while in big fights. Team work makes the dream work. Lol
---
It's literally a mutated bear.
---
A BEAR.
---
Park bench plan
---
I totally agree, or just make a card for each star with the ability to equip more than one.
---
Speak for yourself. I live right next a Yao Guai spawn, the damn thing needs to be nerfed. That stagger is ridiculous, if it gets even *one* hit on you, you're as good as dead.
---
If anything, make deathclaws tougher.
---
No I'm perfectly fine with the damage they deal. I want the stagger to be decreased because there is hardly any reasonable window to attack, and half the time it gets interrupted by the stagger.
---
I'm the same build, and let's not even start with who has the longest scope . . . But anyways, the bears were hanging out way up by the pond near the station. Between your 2-shot life and mine, we would've had a chance IF YOU GOT OFF THE POLE!
---
Ok, I'll bite - What armor / playstyle are you using? Yeah, the legendary alpha mirelurk queen is no joke. Unless you cripple her legs and spouts. Then I bust out the heavy guns and make quick work of her.
---
Seduce  a mirelurk queen.
---
Does the daily count?
---
Just put that one on. That makes my CHR +5 with that and strange in numbers. Still can’t share. Got to be bugged
---
This post alone has made me wanna step up my camp game..... I am a box on a staircase (floating camp) offender ...and I am ashamed ..... sorry guys
---
So I don’t need to track down officers/code pieces? I can just use that site to skip that stage?
---
I’ve had that happen too.. think about it this way... the drill didn’t find anything.
---
Seconded.
---
I’m. 90% sure I wasn’t/ haven’t been with you at any event.  I don’t use two shot except on my laser and really don’t use that for bears. 
---
The only events I really need to be on the pole is ash heap and cranberry bog.
---
Yes, no silo code pieces are needed
---
That’s a good question man, I felt like it was pretty abrupt as well compared to how they usually operate. I am kind of excited in a way too because I’m am anxious to see what new changes to pvp they have after Wastelanders drops. The faction based pvp is just my prediction but who knows what they will try to do.
---
Has to be, idk how easy you can get mutations. But might wanna try to get rid of them all and start over. Like a cleansing. I do it every once in awhile on my characters. But I know all the mutations too so it makes it easier for me. With all the updates they prolly got shit all out of wack or something.
---
Shotguns need a anti armor perk and range
---
Everybody forgives you.
---
Just be happy that radiated bears from Whitesprings dont go into the forest lol.
---
But there are so few enemies you need to be careful of in the game....why nerf the few that are dangerous?
---
If anything, buff the hell out of other stuff.
---
Shotguns arent really an anti armor weapon...
---
dope ... thanks fam .. I'll post an update when I upgrade my living standards
---
The shotgun bug needs to be fixed.  No more of this magically healing super mutants b.s.
---
Honestly... This sounds like a nightmare mate hahaha gave me good laugh though
---
Looking forward to seeing what you build
---
I am aware
---
I was simply responding to any and all pole sitters in general. You want to sit on a pole in the Ash Heap and Bog? No problem. But in the Savage Divide you sometimes have to find the bears, not just wait for them to come to you. *sigh*
---
For your second try a vanguard build. Once you get the pieces of armor set, start collecting good junkie weapons. There is a guide to which addictions to get. The build is kinda a hybrid and will definitely give you somewhat the bloody damage. Nothing will top bloody but this is pretty good.
---
Yes, even better (though not that much different) would be the ability to set a filter on whatever container we wanted.  If I want the tiny metal footlocker to be a weapon locker, I just set it to that - it would work similarly to the inventory filter, and last over resets (and could be changed later).  That way they don't have to add *new* things, just make an adjustment to existing containers.
---
"I launched all the nukes and killed all the dragon looking thingies I could find and my character *still sucks*! What am I doing wrong?!" 
---
Lol you never know these days.
---
Yes,im lv 235 and wanted a change and bought some tse and intigating explosive shot guns.changed my perk card build to all shotty and i went to westtek...in close up range i needed 5 or 6 shots from a instigating explosive double barrel shotgun to kill one mutant.went strait back to my camp and changed it al back to commando...
---
I know. Most if not all the time are the guy running after them. Because mr. bloodied on 10 health wants to not die.
---
I restarted a while ago and some high level dude dropped some pretty useless serums and told me to sell them. Left flatwoods with around 1300 caps.
---
That isn't a bad fix but it isn't great either. It needs more muzzle break mods that let us change spread and it needs a higher base damage and range.
---
Max level on excavator is 45. 
---
DR isnt the best (compared to the other PAs), but with the carry weight bonus and calibrated shocks...you can still sprint, even at ridiculously high weights (something the non PA weight reduction armor doesn’t seem to allow).
---
As long as you dont mind not being able to fast travel (which, BTW, does get annoying at times) excavator is wonderful for junk junkies....
---
Aye free caps. Love it.
---
I know none unfortunately, but they are not to hard to buy. Just not sure if it’s the mutations, or if it’s my addictions that’s causing the problem
---
14 hours, but yep, not quick.
---
Shotguns should pack a punch that is enough to take out a scorched conquerer from melee range, and that is about that of a rifle until about 15 feet.
---
They also need smaller spread. 
---
This is all coming from someone who hunts with shotguns and has for years.
---
They nerfed them too hard a while back. They need some of their range back and maybe some better mods and a few perk reworks maybe. Also I gave up on my shotgun. I had a amazing TSE combat a while back but the dmg bug where enemies heal when hit just happened too much to make them viable.
---
You know I made this complaint in in my first few weeks now I'm lv 549 and I just dont care anymore
---
My opinion is a little bias because I only have experience with my BE combat shotty and I got that thing intending to sprint up to close quarters and just VATS a torso shot on everything, but they are pretty OP if you ask me. With perks and the right mods I can accurately hipfire from a decent distance and score killing shots on super mutants. Bloodied explosive obviously is the top damage output so again my opinion is definitely influenced by that
---
Damn how many hour have you put into the game.
---
I'd love to drop extra keys please. I have a habit of grabbing everything I see and dropping later.
---
Maybe you should change your tactics to fit the threat. There's a reason tanks don't fight without infantry around.
---
The machine being powered or not doesn't matter. In this instance this machine is never powered, so I can't just unpower it again.
---
Totally agree that we should be able break apart perk card stacks. Can we also display how many of each type we already have when selecting new ones? This "max owned" thing doesn't help much.
---
Yeh i use to love it to,great fun.its just not doable anymore.
---
Xbox here - no issues and super duper works amazing making them!
---
You know something that is still deadly.
---
Stigwigs. I fought 5 of em at once and they destroyed me while I was in power armor due to there poison attack. The fog crawlers on the other hand are just annoying because they knock you around so they aren't that much of a problem.
---
PSN is aj-ninetyeight
---
I thinks its 400...same as a paid for it.
---
The issue is bloodied explosive will always be OP. 
---
Shotguns need to have massive damage in about a 5 foot range, and damage comparable to the hunting rifle til about 20 feet. After that they SHOULD be almost useless. But rn they stop being useful in base from at about 5 feet and still don't work fully with center mass shots.
---
It creates a massive QoL issue for certain builds that can't get much use out of Intelligence. You either spend levels doing nothing but moving SPECIAL points around or trust someone else to give back your 3-star legendary weapon with perfect rolls after they've upgraded it for you. Bethesda can't even restore items that get lost due to glitches, there's no recourse for someone ghosting and blocking you as soon as you hand over that anti-armor explosive 250 DR reload 50 cal they promised they'll mod and hand right back.
---
I'm convinced most Fallout YouTubers are actually pretty terrible at the series.  At least Oxhorn has the excuse he focuses on story and lore, but guys like MATN go into a endgame area with a level 20, doesnt read quest text, then complains when he cant figure things out or the level 20 keeps dying.  I almost want to say it was forced ineptitude considering his FO3 Is Better Than You Think video goes into small details in quest structure and text that he seemed to have forgotten in that raid stream.  Maybe he's just jumping on the 76 hate bandwagon now.
---
I had to spend 4 months respecing a shotgun build I started in beta after the nerf.
---
Dunno what to tell you. Since Meat Week has been back, I haven't been in a single one that's failed. Normally there are at least 4+ players. If one is on drums, one on spits, one getting meat, and one greens, it works fine. Everyone of course drops their prime on the bbq, adds some wood, and Chally feed if they have it. If there are only 2 people, you're probably going to fail no matter what. 
---
If you're in multiple failing events, I can tell you right now it's not my fault.
---
Console - Map &gt; LB &gt; Game &gt; Audio &gt; select feature you want raise or lowered
---
Been working for me on the PC. You might want to file a bug report.
---
I've never seen the walls. Maybe someday. :p Someone should make a "bug" achievement list!
---
Oh wow, that's like extreme version.
---
That sounds hilarious.
---
Get you some addictol and start trouble shooting I reckin friend. And if you need help with mutations hmu. I can do them for the mats and help you a little with them too if need be. Just not all of the mats. Lol
---
What’s the info saying your damage should be on the weapon?
---
I've had various other graphic issues on load in, but in over 1000 hours this is the first time it's just been all purple.
---
Whoa, that sounds magical.
---
?
---
Still happens occasionally even when weilding a semi-auto version of the Tesla on the PC. I have to toggle to my secondary and then back to get it to do damage.
---
U dont have all the mats to craft it?like flux?
---
Yeah.
---
Deathclaws are supposed to be the most fearsome creature in the Wasteland... they need a huge buff if anything.
---
oh no!
---
The problem with adding more budget involves the amount of processing power the server and your client has to render the camps. More budget is more power and will cause longer load in times
---
Like 1187 hours when I last checked ive done a lot of whitesprings farming in the old days
---
That would also work and might be easier just filter. Good idea.
---
That's what I was getting at with being biased, but I'm able to get accurate center mass shots from a lot further than 5 feet, probably over 20. The hipfire is a lot less accurate and damaging because half the shot will hit a limb or the ground but that is what VATS is for. I only have 3 perception so I dont even use concentrated fire when shotgunning, just skeet shooter. VATS will still get me a dead center mass shot from within 20 ft and I'm thinking more like 30ft.
---
Damn, that sucks. I'm sorry. I always put my PA on for those now, even if it overencumbers me like crazy.
---
I got mats no problem. Are you on PS4?
---
How frequently do super high level players completely respec tho? I’d imagine even at 150 your build would be pretty situated
---
Try to end your hoarding habits now, just to keep things simple in the future.   If you have weapons you're never using sell them, scrap them or feed them to the scrip machine.  Personally I'd keep whatever set of PA you're currently using and ditch the rest.  Keep your eyes peeled for level 50 T-51b or wait 'till 50 then craft yourself some X-01.  You'll also get some free ultracite PA eventually.
---
Yeah I hear you lol I collect bloodied weapons and carry 10 of them on me at all times to use, and then another 8 or so that dont fit in my stash box
---
When I was around level 15 I was struggling pretty hard until I ran into a high level. He gifted me a ton of stimpaks and a level 15 explosive 44. If it wasn’t for that I don’t think I would of had the motivation to keep playing. 
---
Whenever my friend finally got the game I passed the 44 on to him and now he’s having a great time.
---
I'm told he has the meat hook extra hook plans and from my experience no one else has. Of course I haven't found it on him either.
---
No i didnt downvote. I'm just confused on the question.
---
Damn, lucky. I'm trying to build up my bloodied stash.
---
They'll show up when you relog. I've had this issue for about a month now.
---
Interesting. Will give that a shot.
---
Agreed
---
Ah yeah that sucks. I was trying to build blueprints for nuclear winter and constantly having to PvP for a workshop. I understand the workshop thing and all but i smwish there was a place o could make my blueprints in peace without having to worry about my actual camp budget.
---
I'm looking to sell a couple. The game has given me 2 bloodied power fists after I bought 2 for 1500 each of course
---
I change mine based on what I'm doing.  If I am about to run into a nuke zone, I move some cards around.  If I'm about to sell/scrap a crap tonne of stuff, I move some cards around.  I'm only level 103 but I actually still have about 13 levels of cards I have not unlocked.
---
I really just want separate ammo cans.
---
You should move. No, wait, lets nerf the creature instead.
---
But at his stage it would be faster to just restart
---
Yeah, you're right. Gotta cut down on the psychotats, I guess.
---
I got the plans last night via SBQ and seen them in watoga
---
I just went through and cleaned my stash out of weapons and chems that i never use. Im down to 4 power armor chassis now. The one i have on is almost complete just missin a right leg. And the others have high lvl parts that i cant even use, so im thinkin about just scrsppin those parts and than getting rid if the chassis.
---
I think shotguns are quite strong actually,  but they do best in a vats build. Avoid two shot at all cost, that makes shotguns practically useless.  Also in my experience combat shotguns are the best since they get piercing mods which make a huge difference.
---
I might have to pull my Mutant Slayer's shovel down from it's display and pay them a visit.
---
Hahaha, good idea.
---
I never min Max armor, I just keep the best possible pieces as a whole. My shotgunner wears leather only, my unarmed shadowed combat, my commando Is all about BoS.
---
Yes, we should also be allowed to fill it with acid and dissolve the bodies of our enemies for some sort of reward.
---
Final Render also streamed NW with MATN. Him, Juicehead and Kevduit actually know what they're doing. :)
---

---
I'm just saying I've seen firsthand how stupid that stagger can be on more than one occassion. Yes, it should be tough, and yes, it should have some kind of a stagger, but it shouldn't be able to completely annihilate you in a couple of hits *because* of that stagger.
---
My ign is Enzth. I will check that sub out thanks for sharing. Looks kinda dead though last post was days ago.
---
I apologize, I see questions getting downvoted here all the time asking for more info. Again I apologize to you. 
---
I had a similar deal happen and realized I had wrong cards played and switched them which more than doubled the damage overall and why I asked. 
---
Again I apologize to you.
---
I wouldn't describe Jon's opinion as "hate" so much as "disappointment" about all the missed opportunities 76 has passed up to actually make an interesting game in the long term.  If you like "FO3 is Better Than You Think" he has a great one called "Fallout 76 - What Went Wrong and How to Fix It" full of excellent suggestions on what would need to be fixed for Fallout 76 to be more enjoyable, or at least more interesting.  He hasn't given up on it entirely, but he thinks it could have been so much better, and he's not wrong.
---
Let me know if you find out how to shut up Rose
---
I mean, if you can launch all the nukes and kill all the Sierra Bravos, your character can’t suck that bad, haha
---
THIS. They're fucking called *Death*claws, make them live up to the name.
---
The first deathclaw you meet un FO4 Is stronger and More dangerous than any deathclaw in FO76.
---
Whole content ftw. I love it.
---
What else besides prime cuts?
---
Yeah. Someone said they always run a set of Mutant's armor which is a jack of all trades armor.  I switch between bolstering, unyielding, and Troubleshooter's depending on the situation.
---
Tbh 1500 for that isn't too bad! I haven't gotten anything useful from the Purveyor. 😔
---
He does fallout lore videos on YouTube.  You should check him out if you're interested in it
---
Mirelurk crabs or hunters.
---
Yeah, bears are dangerous and surviving should be a miracle against the odds. Try to stay away from them, like most of us do when we are not in for a fight.
---
Just don't let them get close to you.  (Or get a flamer, mine puts them down in seconds)
---
You have to upload it somewhere, most use imgur, then post the image address. It's stupid, and I wish whoever was responsible for this subreddit would change the image rules.
---
👌👌 is there a set spawn location for hunters? Because when i got to find then there's only kings there.
---
Just put a few bullets into something and move onto the next enemy. If someone kills it you get exp.
---
What we need is the ability to make any junk item into some kind of 'static' object by crafting that can freely be placed in the camp editor. Like OCDecorator for FO4.
---
I think they're great with a critical build, you only need rank one of four leaf clover and you get a critical nearly every other shot.
---
Add better criticals or eagle eyes mutation or both, along with a crit receiver and it's incredible.
---
What I want are slugs. Who the fuck takes buckshot against a supermutant? Make it a rare plan drop, fine, but not at all? Come on!
---
I’ll see what I can do
---
Sure, and that's one of the options I listed above. Definitely worth mentioning as the best use of your time! Players get attached to their characters, or don't want to unlock recipes or plans again, etc. Different strokes for different folks, I guess.
---
r/BoneAppleTea
---
I def want that drum aswell
---
i only take 1 point in concentrated fire for the headshots
---
IMO the other 2 points would be better spent elsewhere
---
Honestly I was gonna say that but i thought ppl would hate it.
---
You aren't the first and you won't be the last to suggest this... But hot damn I wish they'd take note!
---
I wear pocketed shadowed and it Is enough to sneak everywhere. Don't overthink it. High agility and sneak perks, plus what your armor can give.
---
It would be pretty cool but also I don't see something like that being added to the game. Specifically because we've already got atom shop skins for that sort of thing - why would Bethesda add something better, and for free, when they've already tried to provide it as a paid addon?
---
Happened to me once tonight.  Just reset the game.
---
Do the attendants at The Greenbrier slide around on their backs at amazing speeds.
---
Pistols, one handed melle (not unarmed), and shotguns all need buffed.
---
I'm the least stealthy bloodied melee you've seen in your life. My usual thing is run up to it and one of us is gonna die
---
It's not just Prime Cuts.  Public events are great for events like Grahm's Meat Cook, but it's pretty crappy for events where a legendary might spawn, especially for lower levels.  Want an easy legendary from Campfire Tales?  Too bad.  Douchey McOneshot wants to show everybody how much damage their exploding plasma gatling does.
---
Edit: So does anybody have the courage to share why you feel my opinion is wrong or are you just going to downvote?
---
It's a fun event. Let it be.
---
1: kevduit is excellent
---
2: thanks to norespawns I've spent hundreds and hundreds of hours on building in 4 and 76. Davey is one of my top YouTubers ever
---
So 3/20+ events have failed for you, so you decide to have to make a thread on reddit talking shit about the people doing drums? Seems to me your win ratio is pretty good, and maybe you can look at the positive side instead of the negative.
---
I bet. Are you using the bobblehead detecting perk? strength was the last one I found but my collection's finally complete. Now I'm running the comic book detection perk trying to finish those collections. I'm still working on the 'use 76 bobbleheads' achievement so I'm actually not selling any of them in my vendor. I was just going to hook you up because I know what it's like to have OCD and want to fill these collections for display. Lol. Once that achievement is done I'll probably put all my extras in my vendor at 25 caps like I do my comics.
---
I'll probably get downvoted, cause that's what happens here lol 
---
"Change!? We can't have that!"
---
Ive had this happen in NW several times
---
I'm on PC and haven't seen it
---
I hope fo76 is one of the games that gets cross platforming support in the near future. That way it won't be an issue anymore.
---
There's few posts on the subreddit, but the discord is somewhat active about calling nukes and Encryptid events. The last post on the Discord is less than two hours old, which isn't bad for Sunday outside prime-time.
---
Basically the same, go to your map, then settings, then audio.
---
Play more, level up.  I'm a level 109 and I'm not going to NOT participate in an event just because a low level participate such as yourself.  Just as another person here said, fire a few shots at as many targets as you can.  You will get a lot of XP that way, more if the targets are higher level to match the higher level players in the event.
---
High level players aren't trashing the event, you're just not taking advantage.
---
Just avoid them! They are one of the very few things you need to be cautious about. You are asking for the enemy to be easier/not as deadly. The game is easy as it is. Why do you want them to be easier to kill?
---
I know I'm not the average player. Yes I have my gripes , but I'm very much still enjoying myself well past 2200 hours . I got 4 characters, no mules. I do my dailies on each character every day. When friends are on we have fun doing team stuff. When I'm on solo I can farm for hours in peace. I love the inventory management part of the game. I love the exploration. I love the huge variety in builds. I love camp building, I could keep going. A lot of people burn out on stuff quicker than I do. But you might be lucky and be as crazy as I am. Time will tell. Psn is signgorilla.
---
Omg yes get adrenal reaction, twisted muscle, and talons. Most important perks for the build IMO are nerd rage 1 and serendipity 3
---
I really enjoyed it until I explored the entire map. Then things began to get stale for me. I'm at level 70 IIRC, and while there are still some things to do, I've put the game on hold until the new NPC content is released so I can enjoy it more.
---
I didn’t realise. 
---
I guess the floating boxes really are hated.
---
I use my remote control. Mute button.
---
Had a messenger event bug and we just emoted and punched the bot for about 5 minutes. When he/she got bored they dropped me 100+ stimpaks, waved and dipped out lol. Thank you kind stranger
---
It should still show as available in shaded print.
---
Yeah, but why should any player have to do that?  It's clearly something broken with the game itself.
---
I just want to bang the drum all day.....
---
really :(  and will the npc and new quests come out then??
---
No, there's just an annoying vocal minority that like spamming this reddit for some reason.
---
Cool idea, very fleshed out. Good stuff
---
Same here! I even have to set schedules for gaming or I end up playing way too much on weekends haha
---
Mines full of stag right now... ran into a herd...lol
---
Why are you so hellbent on this thing being stronger than the offspring of a deathclaw and a scorchbeast? 
---
A broken mechanic is a broken mechanic. There's no reason any creature in the game should be able to stagger someone with every single hit *and* hit you fast enough to completely immobilize you.
---
Id say just ur bad luck
---
MDGA! I’m with ya! We should see posts like need help to kill a DeathClaw!
---
maybe nerf OP builds can help too XD
---
[firegodjon](https://i.imgur.com/Ov9tmii.jpg)

It's cute!
---
Luck is a good one, aside from the weapon class you choose (agi for pistols, per for rifles, str for melee etc).
---
True
---
Happened every time I tried to kill it with this weapon outside power armor.
---
Just wasn't sure if it was the weapon or not.
---
Agreed!
---
Pvp play dps and pve players play medic
---
Damn why is it so hard smh. I guess copy and paste was to hard to implement on reddit
---
Nice !
---
Did the same with no man's sky and while yeah there were rocky days at first , I did enjoy it while it lasted! (now I'm hooked to fallout76 haha )
---
Way better than rolling away my 400 scrip for crap.
---
Very nice!
---
Congrats!
---
Even better would be slightly nerfing legendarys but having more of them
---
To be fair - The floating camps are stupid looking. Super stupid.
---
I dought its the weapon as i have wittnessed others useing that same gun on the hermitcrab but then again im on xbox not pc
---
If they’re being replaced with something “new”. I would if nothing else, expect the queen to be done, maybe random scorchbeast attacks on settlements, I’m reading between Bethesda’s lines in the sand
---
A TSE double barrel shotgun and marsupial mutation can work wonders against enemies. Jump in the air. Drop them in seconds.
---
I just wish it was a quad explosive.
---
No, other subs you can do that. Here they don't allow it.
---
Radical
---
What’s your system? If you’re PC I’ve got dozens of them since I grab one out of habit when I clear the asylum
---
You shouldn't be having an issue especially with a melee build. try VATS + bloodied melee and that should do the trick. Adjusting your perks so you do more damage also helps.
---
I’ll upvote that.
---
Was nice in FO4 to have separate storage containers for weapons, armor, etc.
---
IDK why you dont want 19 copies of the Robco access key....
---
at least all those extra keys have no weight, but yea, it would be nice to be able to drop them - even a destroy on drop.
---
Less stuff to scroll through.  
---
Probably be a slight bit easier on the servers, too.
---
I wonder what causes that.
---
People have said it ..the events require aggression hanging around passively or listening to whiney players cry they didnt get a tag will cause everyone to lose ..remember the spawn areas and push them
---
LOL
---
Thanks ! Even though I'm a melee build , at least the str points are there and I was fortunate to get a few heavy gunner perks from card packs :)
---
I’d just enjoy it if they expanded the map a bit for high level players or add some new locations
---
I just want it cause my base is behind wes tek and would love something to intimidate then a bit more than my theremin.
---
Do the meat week BBQ.  
---
I’ve done it about 8 times so far - He’s had the chally feed recipie every time.
---
At the 2p event today, (ps4) he had the park bench plan for 240c (hard bargain not equipped)
---
You actually have to do a fair bit of damage to get credit for the kill.  It's not a simple matter of just tagging everything with a single shot, and I can attest that nine times out of ten, high-levels kill the creatures before this can happen.
---
Grenades are a viable workaround for this.
---
Most enemies aren't too hard, but mirelurk kings are a different story. When a deathclaw (THE wasteland monster of legend) is easier than an mutant crayfish, something is out of whack.
---
Yeah, I'm not saying take one shot per target, but you do have to do some damage.  My main point was he just needs to keep at it. Don't hate just because there are people higher level than you doing more but if you keep at it, you'll soon be in that group.
---
You can farm stag by going to the farm present in the lying Lowe quest line. 5 stags generally per server hop.
---
Edit: the best carry weight food though is "smoked mirelurk fillets"
---
Since carry weight buffs cant be stacked like melee damage can.
---
I’ve got 27 Robco Facility cards....
---
I agree.  To me, the highest-level Deathclaw should have HP comparable to a Sheepsquach. Ain't no way I should be felling them in one hit.
---
Don’t know but it happens often and with the purple screen at the same time
---
This happened to me too. I went 5-6 places before winding up at what I assume was the site of a drug bust that was happening during the bomb.
---
The micro transactions are not a big deal at all lol. If you liked fallout 4, exploring, fighting super mutants and ghouls, you should like this game. Massive map to explore and always adding new stuff for free. Big update coming in November.
---
Well, I only use it for silo runs, AWOL, and the ISQ fight. Right now I'm having a lot of fun using a full Bolstering Sentinel set (with full health) and Junkie's weapons and many defensive perks. I pretty much never die.
---
Awesome, in that case I might buy it. 
---
Thanks!
---
I can't say I knew that was Electronic Boutique was owned by GameStop. Because when I was a kid they went out of business here. Closing down all of it's stores and not opening anything in their place for quite a few years. So "the more you know" I guess, it is a neat fact.
---
Walk over to EB. Record them saying that it's cool and that's how they do things and I will 100% believe you and never raise another word against you on this matter. Meaning you will have won beyond winning. 
---
As it is now. I don't believe it as they refuse to do that here in FL. Again record it upload it and boom, winning.
---
I believe you need to do 1k in damage to loot the queen. Try hitting her with a bloodied melee weapon. My level 100 crafter gets better rewards than my fully built main toon.
---
Yeah, I don't think this is viable for 76, but I really do like the concept of things like the Well Traveled Pip-Boy paint, where you could put stickers on something and make it your own.
---
Still one of the coolest skins in the game.
---
The skins don't work as a mod to an existing backpack, you get the option to make the skinned backpack in the list with the standard one that you learn from the tadpole quest. The small standard one is not offered as a skinned version,I have both and can only see the standard size skinned ones. Hope that clarifies it.
---
Agreed but one can always wish
---
This is the real problem.
---
Yes, plus it feels awesome to start off with good gear, stocked up on low level legendaries, ammo, and aid, and a fat wallet . My new level 12 held her own with a low level death claw. On my first play through, that same death claw was shredding me around level 30 yet.
---
This. Plus the event takes place really often. Try to kill five Yao guai at the same Time with your lvl 25 shotgun and tell me how it went. Then, go for the lvl 100 mirelurk queen.
---
I'm also worried about those guys. Please leave me alone when I pillage and loot some stupid farmers village.
---
No but I had an mirv frag convert itself to a pile of 1hp grenades spread over a whole area...
---
Had to skip looting that whole area, didn't know if they'd change back when I walked in.
---
💀
---
No issues with the hermit crab for me so far. But I did get several crashes/disconnects at or near the Ash Heap event, so it does look like the Primal Cuts events might have more stability problems than usual.
---
Ugh I hate when that event glitches. But sweet deal, you got stimpaks!
---
1. Go to Silo Alpha
---
2. Launch Nuke Grafton
---
3. Profit
---
Thanks! I'll see what I can do. My carry weight is up to 545 now and idk how lol
---
I guess raiders and settlers based on the faction you choose.
---
I wish you could have more perk card points to use. I would like to have more cards equipt at any given point. Hell, I'd take 5 more points but 10 would be awesome. Even if it's a bonus ability if you hit a certain level (say level 150 or 200).
---
I also would like the fridge to hold more than 15 items, if I put 15 firecracker berry juice that should count as 1 not 15. 
---
I would also like a bigger stash and C.A.M.P. budget. 
---
Also it would be cool that after you hit certain levels you unlock map expansions. (Such as Nuka world or far harbor for fallout 4). 
---
Also would like more ways to earn larger amount atom points. I dont have money to put into a fake house. I have a real house that needs money. LoL
---
And, this isnt really a game fix but a general complaint, I would like to be able to do Vault 94! Everyone is afraid to because they dont want to lose their whole inventory or their whole character. And when I am able to no one comes prepared and they run out of stims, radaway or ammo and they start dropping out and I've never been with a team who can finish it. It's so frustrating! I've built up my stash of stuff, maxed out my melee and stocked up on fusion cores in preparation. I say until all glitches are fixed they do not add more content.
---
Yesterday i was playing and both times I went to the event for prime cuts for the meat cook in the ash heap it froze. Another server wouldn't announce events. I love this game. It's never ending and lots to do but would be better if it were stable. And had more things unlocked along the way. Even when they add a new line of quests (the sheepsquash quest line) I'm done in a few days.
---
EVERY deathclaw should be a legendary miniboss.
---
This card based perk system REALLY makes me miss the old perk system.
---
If one were allowed to buy resets or resets perks .. it would work just the same if not better than the rng hodge podge is implemented now.
---
I actually do agree with the specific timing.  Even with the Pneumatic torso mod, a Yao Guai will typically score two hits for the price of one.  At least, if I'm running Pneumatic, this shouldn't happen.
---
I'm a bit miffed that you can't jump on top of the hermit crab van shell. But, never got disconnected from shooting it.
---
The freedom to act however you want is pretty awsome. Good guys vs Bad guys. Watching trolls / greifers get owned is priceless especially when some random high level decides to engage them and takes them down or nukes them while their distracted.
---
Stable flux is technically just a junk item that has a component value of one "pure" flux. The component is always referred to as "pure" flux in crafting menus.
---
I wouldn't mind that at all. Buckshot would be good for hitting limbs simultaneously, and slugs for concentrated hits.
---
I think it's important to not put a PVE player into a PVP combat scenario with his character. PVE player can not be killed or kill other players. Field medic is a part of a PVP role because he's there fighting and getting killed. Preparing medical supplies for the frontlines is a PVE role. PVE players should be able to contribute to the fight from distance in other means like controling/building bots, defenses etc.
---
Everyone needs a good tesla and good bloodied melee weapon.
---
Lol market has a 5 day wait on new accounts before you can even post.
---
I gave a kid a medics explosive +1 perception DB and an aae combat rifle +1 agility to him
---
They will all hit that point. More so with the realization there is NO end game, at all.
---
"I'm board … events suck cause of 2 shot explosive weapons, someone shot my house .. winge winge winge." Yet with all the complaining they do. They will still blindly defend the game … which is sad. 
---
They should go back to Fo4 and mod it properly to get the best of fallout on PC … it's way better than this hot mess.
---
You do know what year it is right?
---
Simple, don’t go back to the toxic valley
---
Ok so about to head down the serious pharmaceutical user route.
---
I have some probably noob questions:
---
1/ Do addictions heal themselves eventually? 
---
2/ Which do you run with? I’m mostly looking at a melee / shotgun / heavy weapon guy so probably going to avoid STR lowering ones. Any thoughts around that? I can also see a serious possibility of a juicer sniper with the matrix above.
---
3/ How much of yours are determined by what you want to take, vs. what you take to just get addicted? For instance on melee I’m going to be swilling Whisky and Psychobuff for sure and can gear to keep them up constantly (well and +3 CHA beer). But maybe I’ll snag an addictions to something else just to hold on to and keep myself at a steady 5.

The lack of matchmaking causes me to stay away from Vault 94. I've finished it once but I don't want to rely on third party services to find a team.
---
I want the bath tube filled with water.. would make my food and drink creatings so much easier..
---
rug is good for building on anything
---
I think it's the same thing that affects shotguns more often than not.
---
On a sufficiently bad server, even the Gatling Gun isn't slow enough to avoid it.
---
Yesterday at Col Kelly monument there was at least 20+ and half were glowing and another 2+ dozen in the toxic dried lakebed area... thought it was a glitch, never seen that many at once!
---
Solid Idea mate!
---
I brought out my shotguns again last night thinking I’d spray tag things during the prime meat events. Cool cool.
---
Then I thought “Hey I’ll put the perks back in and maybe go kill some things” ... but yeah ... no ... they are still auto-healing mobs. One shot down to 5% ... then right back to 75% or so. Back in the box they go.
---
They have to fix the “many hits quickly registers as bad so we negate / heal the damage” bug thing.
---
Ok thank you
---
Just make new friends in game, it's easy. I'm on PC and we usually have people show up at the hangout camp and join in whatever and their welcome. Trading helps you link up with people also.
---
Agreed or at least as hard to kill. The Meat Week enemies some are level 100. 
---
I just think these enemies need to be harder to kill in a big way. As it is now people run toward them!...lol
---
I've watched that video, and I agree with a lot of it. I was talking about his behaviour during the Vault 94 live stream which was frustrating to say the very least.
---
What will people do when their whole game revolves around defeating the scorch queen everyday? No more holding a giant vibrating death tool while wearing a glorified protective blanket (cool looking pa with paint) atop the fence while calling out the lowbies for leeching off their hard work.. I will miss these episodes. :(
---
Feel free to shoot me a friend request my IGN is the same BuckshotEarl I play on PC.
---
well, yes... but actually, no.  
---
they nerfed the tse shotguns into the ground, and what do you see now on the trading hub? bloodied everywhere. (me included, but i run bloodied since beta)  
---
people will flock to the highest damage numbers a build will provide, and if they just nerf nerf nerf everything (and this is just a wild assumption) many will quit the game, and we don't want that.   
---
when i see a mirelurk queen i go "oh shit" because her acid will melt my 54hp in seconds, and the only other things i fear are strong yao guys and swarms of anglers and gulpers.   
---
lvl 94 glowing death claw? pfff. easy though.   
---
they just either have way too little health, or resistances.
---
Thanks! I'll add it on top and search for it.
---
Dont get to play much due to work but its always the same in my experience with these events higher levels one shotting being greedy for legendaries. Yeh ok i might be lucky and get a shot or two in and get a piece of star armour but thats it no Bloodied 3 stars for me...
---
Shotgun problem is the range mostly(and having faster fire/pump rate would be nice too) shotguns have a much more effective range than 2 meters.
---
I'm not a fan of multiplayer games, love all the FO games. Gave FO76 a try during the free weekend and was hooked instantly. Bought it 1 day in an have played daily since. Whatever bad rap it got in the beginning, I don't see any major issues. Occasionally you will get fucked by a glitch but it doesn't happen as often as people will lead you to believe (or if it does it doesn't happen to me that often) . From what I can tell most of the people complaining now are either little entitled crybaby Mitch's or people who haven't played the game since the beginning and still choose to complain about shit isn't an issue anymore.
---
I just got it a couple weeks ago and dont regret it all. These people complaining about "pay2win shop" are silly, from what i can tell its all QoL items and a fridge so your food doesnt spoil as fast.
---
Interesting, I'll keep an eye out for it and update you if I find it.
---
A decent amount.
---
Will try but the queen is usually dead before I even see it.
---
The toy master.
---
It wouldn’t make sense for them to get rid of the most iconic enemies of this game for dlc, plus they said scorch beasts and scorched aren’t going anywhere and sealing fissure site prime would only get rid of the only event that brings everyone together, plus the scorch beasts will never stop coming as they keep reproducing millions underground, the story of the game is basically the vault dwellers doomed to continuously nuke the fissure site prime and kill the new queen or else Appalachia will fall and they will spread all over the wasteland
---
Nonoo sorry. We are saying with a new perk. Sorry for confusion.
---
So would an instigating explosive be better than a two shot explosive? Or do you have any suggestion for a better perk to go with explosive?
---
Yes. Headshot throwing knives do 1000% damage
---
Even more so come November.
---
yea thats what i remembered. in fallout 4 i have some mods that make artillery really fun. like you can throw the flares way faster, every artillery piece can fire across 1/4th of the map, and the animations get disabled which makes them turn and fire immediately. in 76... meh
---
Sweet of you!
---
I’m sure at this point I have all the rewards. Working gathering duplicate tenderizers. Only two so far.
---
ohhh, thx. just in time, i was just about to fire the game up haha
---
Thanks anyway. Someone hooked me up for free.
---
I doubt that the scorched would disappear, but if they do there should definitely be some new enemies. Raiders should definitely make a comeback
---
I never knew this
---
There's usually oodles of stag up in the Toxic Valley, too.
---
Exactly. Irl a shotgun will do almost as much damage as a hunting rifle up to a substantial range.
---
It should be enough damage to one tap a scorched conqueror for about 2 meters, do about   doube lever action damage for about 20 feet, and do about regular handmade damage til around 30. Then be almost useless past that.
---
1) nope
---
2) Med-x, psycho, daddyo, day tripper, mentats
---
3) no very much...I do take psycotats a lot
---
Me too!
---
It's a counter on your character that resets after you've looted 60 containers, not a 1 day timer
---
And if you have Aquaboy you can just hide in the rivers and lakes without taking and rad damage
---
Like the multi level white glassed shelf would be a start.
---
Meat cleavers 
---
Meat cleavers
---
Oh and that bloody chef apron
---
Holy shit I've never had mine that high
---
That I do know. But unless you get positioned just right you can be seen from above.
---
It might have been glitched? I didn't have any grilled radstag or anything in me either.
---
I second this. Sometimes I wonder why I'm over encumbered, then I realise I have 5 robot left legs in my inventory
---
It started happening WAY more after patch 13. Same bug that happens with auto weapons. I definitely notice it more with a few nukes on the ground.
---
During the double xp weekend I gained like 8 overseer levels just from that.  I also use dark atom shop clothing so it just looks like a shadow or junk in the water
---
I don't understand why this bothers people so much, he talks for like 8 seconds. I just tune it out now like country music or the dweeb in my office that walks around whistling all the time
---
Intsa diesease is common. I so even fart in the direction of a dieseased enemy, i get a diesease.
---
Huge thanks. That first answer is huge help.
---
Lvl 50 tenderizer! Wooooo!!!
---
Rewatch the trailer. What's that early on? Scorch beast.
---
What console or PC?
---
If you need help stopping suck at PvP I will gladly help. Thank you for being awesome!
---
Not that big of a deal.  I run with 3 rifles.  With all my armor reduction perks and ultralight my carry capacity is 380 and with all my gear on I’m only at 101.  So yeah I got lots of room to go farming.  I go run through harpers ferry sell all the weapons And usually capped for the vender in 1 maybe two runs.
---
Most people dont ive only got 4_5 people ive fought there only so far
---
have you tried killing stuff?
---
Can you spawn there?
---
I still have my shotgun build set up, because I am too bitter to let it go. Further I do believe that they will end up at some point buffing them. Because they have to realize that it was nerfed far too much
---
I've fought the sbq with captain noob before. Haven't seen ox yet. Wonder if apple will show up eventually
---
Have to run into fire.
---
If you have all 5 pieces do you regenerate!?
---
got 2/3 mods but no tenderizer... still many cookouts to attend to I guess!
---
Cool. I will be doing some exploring. Thanks for the info.
---
Sorry, didn't think it was relevant for this. I'm on PC (editing post now),
---
Find a glitch that gives you hundreds or xp
---
Honestly, yeah, I could get down with this. I'm 100% PvE, but I have lots of friends who are PvP oriented and wish I could play with them on those types of runs. My strengths are looting and literal strength, so if I could be a useful PvE player to my PvP pals, that would be a lot of fun.
---
Great idea, friend. Also love that you thought of damn near everything and fleshed it all out. Bethesda should hire you, 10/10 would recommend.
---
Cheers and feel free to hit me up when something math related seems nonobvious (its quite often very nonobvious, but I studied this stuff long).
---
Honestly man I just had to do the leg work and just hit up randoms and build a network of players who were interested it DOES suck that there isn't a matchmaking tool to help find like minded people but I just started talking to people in area chat and some people responded, it's definitely more work than I liked to do but I got a pretty sizable group now so it turned out better than I expected at least and i am always looking to find more people who want to raid because I know it's hard for people to find groups sometimes and don't mind at all helping people who want to grind the gear.
---
I see people that are above 300 quite often. One idea would be to try and use less powerful weapons and try and challenge yourself
---
Nope. I want the option to not use the scope, even if it is attached. Like in other FPS titles.
---
I'm sure you will find a solution to the poop magic conundrum though. I believe in you.
---
Can’t even grind effectively for it since Battle Bot isn’t spawning for me.
---
Prime site is part of a quest
---
I'm going to try that
---
I was just wondering this yesterday...I haven’t seen battle bot since they messed with the event system
---
Really? That must be newish, I posted there the first day I found it.
---
There are no big solutions for that. Alot of people try to farm Whitespring, but it's not an easy task. Basically you need to kill high lvl ennemis and...it's not an easy task and it's ressource consuming.
---
Alot of people were teaming up with high lvl players to farm Whitespring more easilly, but now i think it's no more working like that...your xp gain is now scalled down to your lvl not to his/her lvl.
---
Never Mind
---
It's not wrong, but you can't demand that Douchey McOneshot show any courtesy either.  That's just how people are.
---
That said, I think it's good for high-levels to start a new character and see things from that perspective again.  I know it opened my eyes, because I had assumed it was very much a "tag the enemy, get credit" thing outside of the SBQ, but in reality, you have to reach some invisible threshold of damage for it to count, even on the most basic mob enemies.  Not that I ever acted to intentionally hoard kills, but now I realize I need to pack more patience than I thought I did.  To go any low-level Public Event with the assumption that I should be playing a support role, rather than an active role.
---
It depends on build weapon perks how your play style is and most importantly your lvl and how many people are at the event because I’ve done it solo with just me and my BE railway rifle but as soon as some lvl60s or lower join it is very hard to complete the event that is my preference
---
Nice, thanks!
---
Time is really a thing.  I only recently started having the time to really play and get better at the game. Up until two months ago I was probably in the same boat as you.  Work, school and divorce occupied a lot of my time.  Now that almost all of that is done, I can finally sit and play longer than 30 minutes a week.  You'll get there.  If I can, you can.
---
Go too the West Virginia Lumber mill In the NorthWest of the map,kill all the Supermutants...
---
Quit game,restart game,go back too said Lumber Mill
---
Rinse,Wash,Repeat
---
Same goes for West Tek,&amp; Whitesprings
---
All depends on your level
---
But ye,grind,grind,grind
---
Alternatively you could befriend some higher level folks,join there team,&amp; have em show ya the sights,&amp; collect XP off of there kills.
---
Billion different ways too do it too it
---
My view is that they should only be one card, but the highest one lets you get the ones below it. 
---
3 slots gets you: 
---
* ignore negative effects from mutations or
---
* bypass 75% of armor or
---
* ignore 30% of incoming damage or
---
* occasionally get a handful of caps and pipe pistol or
---
* 30% off travel, breathe underwater / ignore water rads, and get double harvests, or 
---
* 30% damage reduction and 30% AP regen when soloing
---
One of these things is not like the other.  Lockpick and Hacker are *drastically* underpowered for the slots they require.
---
One of my biggest disappointments when 76 first came out was we only have one stash. I always organized stuff in different containers in previous fallout games. But now it's all jumbled together and I hate it.
---
Because a lot of their world was made by just smashing props together, and they didn't always pay close attention to how the collision between those assets flowed.
---
Also with the codes you don’t need them there is a website that decrips them so you don’t have to
---
I don't see why they couldn't have just added an option to put items found in the world to a special tab in your camp building mode, which you can just place down like anything else. Like the alien or Mr. Pebbles plushies... Better option then display cases.
---
Same here I have a bit of OCD and it bothers be the lack of organization I can do
---
YES I love it
---
You've never been spawn trapped in a nuke zone where you cant do anything but die. Not even enough time to put on rad x or radaway. Try to server hop but you spawn in the same world. I lost a lot of materials because of that
---
The thing with this game that’s different from previous Fallouts is that your build matters a lot more. Your damage output has far more to do with your perk and SPECIAL setup than it does with your weapons—aside from ensuring that your weapon choices match your perk choices. 
---
Some weapon classes are better than others, but with the right build you can make anything work. 
---
Spend some time looking at your selections, use https://nukesdragons.com to plan things out and I’m sure you’ll find yourself in a better situation.
---
VATS doesn't work on them. Nothing can lock on. Shotguns were nerfed to hell. No one uses missile launchers.  What kind of perks do you have?  My suggestion. Get all the heavy weapon talents, nerd rage, and a t51b chest with emergency protocols, buy a bloodied gatling gun for 2500 caps. Stay under 20 percent health.
---
Been happen since I started at beta
---
The RNG in this game is annoying.
---
Missile Launchers *are* crappy at any level, though.  Same with the Fat Man.  That's just the bizarre way the game is balanced.
---
Likewise, the Cargobot has an *absurd* amount of HP.  Your best bet is to use something that deals out a steady rate of reliable damage, like the Gatling Gun, or equip the relevant crippling perks for your build to disable its engines.  I remember the first time I took out a Cargobot, all I really had equipment-wise was an explosive Lever Action Rifle, and like you, I must have put 100 bullets and a good 5 minutes into that stupid thing.
---
Tend to go after Cargobots that are being escorted.  The ones that are just flying overhead on their own will often speed off impossibly fast.
---
Meat cleavers, flag plan, anti-mutant armor piece, grill master something, bloody chef hat &amp; outfit....
---
Patiently waiting for the tenderizer plan.
---
Edit: just got the tenderizer :)
---
Based on other comments, now I get to grind for the mod plans...
---
Get well rested xp boost everytime you play, complete the feed the people event for the canned stew which also gives an xp boost. 
---
Then grind and grind.
---
Thank you! Fallout 76 has so much potential :) Hopefully Bethesda has as much faith in it as we do.
---
I don't mean any of this in a negative way, because I love this community. But in the last inside the vault, they told us new things coming that were our things we asked for. There is Alot that needs to be worked on in this game. I haven't every day since launch, but I've played every day for the past 2-3 months and have come across some bad bugs. With bugs, wastelanders, and the new quality of life updates for 2020, there is so much on their plate right now
---
What level are you now?
---
not just that , sometimes i finish an event and i get new loot but im not sure what it is because its mixed with the suff i already got in my inventory,
---
I wouldn't mind having something along these lines either.
---
Especially when you're in the "scavenging" phase of your character, trying to manage your favorites wheel is a hot mess because you'll be swapping weapons out all the time and there's no way to tell one Short Hunting Rifle apart from another in that assignment window.
---
A key ring that consolidates keys that have been used would be a beautiful way to clean up the MISC section of my PipBoy. It would also help to show which keys still have 'pending' targets.
---
39
---
It really does! I know they have to get money, and I do want the developers to get paid, but I'm hoping they can remember they have a base that loves the game and wants it to keep evolving.
---
At some point they are giving super perks for every 50 levels above 50.
---
Alternatively, you could just use them and sell the junk you would otherwise have used for repairs.
---
I had a similar issue not nearly as bad but either way... I just started using them to get rid of them
---
It's good that you picked on it, my first time exiting the vault I was trying to get my bearings and become comfortable with the controls when some higher level player was slapping me to get my attention. I thought he was just being a jerk so I ran away.
---
I didn't realize he was just trying to give a noob a leg up until I tried to help out a level 1 who was fresh from the vault with some stimpaks and plans who kept running away from me.
---
See my final edit of my OP. Thanks for your reply.
---
Thanks! :D
---
Good idea
---
Your last point is spot on, they are specific to you since its a atom shop item.  If that wasnt that case id buy half from you.
---
Exactly, my handmade is about 1-2 shot on normal, then on buffer creatures it's a few more shots. I'm thinking about maxing out my single shot damage perks but don't have points to move around really. I horde stuff and had to make a second character because my main is at a peak of stash full, vending is full, etc.
---
This is my thought too. I know ballistic fiber goes for a nice amount. Imagine how much he won't have to use now.
---
I sell all ammo for 1 cap a piece in my vendor if it gets out of control I drop in a green suitcase at train stations
---
I want to be able to junk ammo to make the ammo I need.
---
I do use them, for all repairs.
---
Thank you. Shame we remove mods with a sledgehammer, because a scope you could just dynamically clip on and off would be amazing.
---
For the past week when I login I'm at my camp and he starts with his bs right away. I'm nowhere near toxic valley.
---
I sell mine for 1 cap apiece as well. It goes against my better judgment to just drop it though haha.
---
Saaaaaame. I created a second toon and named him Shrek lol. He's my mule buddy and carries all the legendaries I hardly use but don't want to give up yet. I also don't really have room to move stuff around and wouldn't even know what to do if I did.
---
I've had mobs come after me during that event, even though I left the radius just as the "make noise" phase ended. As far as I know, nobody else was around so at least I hopefully didn't ruin someone else's attempt, but it sure was annoying to be bombarded by critters while I was trying to cook some food, *and* not getting any event rewards for it. I'm not actually familiar with the event (never done it) but there were critters coming after me for quite a while. O.o
---
Welcome to the club.  I've usually hovered around 250-300 of them and have the same problem of having to devote 30 WT to an item I can't burn through quickly enough even disabling Makeshift Warrior/Gunsmith/White Knight, but also can't justify dropping due to their perceived worth.  I can't even trade the bloody things to a new character where they might actually be useful.
---
I understand how you feel
---
I do, I've not used junk to repair since these dropped from the queen, they are great, love them, but they are now taking up a good portion of my stash, and need to get rid. given the time and effort involved I'm loathed to scrap them off.
---
This is the kind of answer I was looking for. Thank you kind sir or madame.
---
I'm on the same I'll be on in the next half hour for a couple of hours. DM your gamer tag. But I've no mic.
---
I still remember building my first base and making 3 stash boxes thinking I'd use one for guns one for armor and one for junk. Imagine my surprise when I couldn't figure out why my stashes kept getting mixed. It just seems like it would be common sense
---
I distinctly remember being able to ignore the scope if I took aim in 3rd person mode. That was back then. Could be, that I'm hallucinating though.
---
You can get Roman marble heads from the vendor at whitesprings I'm sure.
---
The bug still happens. Futher more they seem to break waaaaay too fast. Buff the range, fix the bug, add a little durability, and maybe add armor pen to the enforcer perk card and I'll be  back in
---
The perk system needs a rework. It is fine until you reach level 50 but after that it becomes a frustrating mess.
---
Yeah there should be higher level stuff, particularly the bigger stuff that you don't see roaming in packs. Let's see really strong behemoths, deathclaws, megasloths, and hermit crabs, sheepsquatch and all that.
---
Most everyone with a decent 1 star weapon and a build that compliments it does huge damage and/or is very survivable. Let's see some monsters with big damage resists and maybe chances to appear at more locations.
---
Use a rifle and rifleman perk or commando
---
Only things bloodied builds need to be concerned about now are mirelurk hunters, queens and anglers because of that spit, atleast in my experience
---
Thanks, given the other far greater things they have to focus on I fully understand this is super small potatoes impacting &lt;0.01% of the players, just feels wrong I have to scrap what is essentially 100's of Queens worth of rewards.
---
TS and Executioners are both primary effects. They can’t be on the same weapon.
---
Just a PSA if you get a god roll or luck out with an item at a vendor or something, quit to menu asap so you don't lose it.
---
frankly.. I forgot I even had any...
---
I dont have that many but I should use them
---
Yea, i hear that, id say go grind some whitesprings and use them to repair your weapons.....or just drop them
---
Are those lockers he sells rare? The 600ish ones, not the tall skinny. These are shorter, wider and lighter in color.
---
That was another thought, let them be shared between the Alt's like other Atom shop items (I know its not, but they are treat that way),  don't want to repeat myself to much but it just feels wrong that I have to scrap off really good rewards.
---
Very good explanation. Thank you!!  Like I said just never wrapped head around that idea of dying without time to even react...
---
And since have been really lucky getting weapons and armor. IE lever action is just 1st example, and AAE combat rifle, FE handmade  like you said quick switch for close in stuff. And from beginning went from vanguard metal to vanguard heavy bos now to full vanguard scout. So pretty much just based everything around what I've gotten!
---
Can someone explain to me what this patch is supposed to be? Are we expecting human NPCs or something?
---
I do use, them, even with White knight and the other perks removed I just earn more than I use and would like to get something from them rather than scrap them.
---
You guys must be new around here.
---
Yes, they definitely did something to thirst because I've been blowing through waters lately.
---
A playable version of the barrel drums would be even better. I'm saddened by the musical intruments i find in the game that i can't add to my camp. (mouth harp especially, how the fk do they tease me with a mouth harp right outside the vault and then give me a frickin tuba?! This is Appalachia damn it, Not Central Mexico, I live in Mexico and Mex Music is the only place I EVER hear a tuba outside of an orchestra. I also lived in North Carolina and NEVER heard a tuba during my time there). No Bueno Bethesda.
---
Do you mean you got it from a legendary during Primal Cuts? I thought the actual meat week event only rewarded 1* pieces of combat armor.
---
Yup... I’ve got both from the event
---
Tbh they aren’t look on here that much. Sure they have a few things they replied too and whatnot but we aren’t distracting them.
---
Hmm, an Advanced Repair Kit build, what would look like, Marine armor and an explosive railway rifle.
---
True. 
---
But if you dont Play PA much like i do, staggers can F you up too. Yao guys, sheepsquatsch and gulpers &gt;can&lt; F my Day up aswell. and the first wave of Rad scorpions on the prime Meat event in the bog. They have crazy reach with their stingers.
---
Basically like anthem
---
Here, I think you dropped these meat cleavers.
---
I'd also like to see a separate Pip-Boy section for "Old Notes" and "New Notes" and you could move them over to get rid of clutter. 
---
I have to scroll for five minutes to get to plans or recipes. 
---
I'd also like to see the different sections (like weapons / armor / aid / etc in ITEMS) be scrollable with a scroll mouse.
---
You should upload it!
---
It was suppose to say plan :/
---
Gulpers yao gais and sheepsquatches can be dangerous but they can be killed mostly before they detect you but ik what you’re talking about xd been there a few times
---
I got all the mod plans when the event was first released during Nuclear Winter. I honestly haven’t been playing this Meat Week as much since it doesn’t have new rewards, but the plans are probably still there. The mod plans are a rare drop. I played the original Meat Week the whole week and barely got all three mod plans unlocked.
---
it was during the first carry weight glitch.
---
I got so rid of notes I put them all in my stash now after I read them then occasionally go through and drop the dupes.
---
How'd you get the Small Backpack? I alrea6 have the Tadpole quest one on my main, but I'd love to get the Small one as well.
---
tenderizer plan is not a drop.
---
I’m a sad boi now
---
Yes please
---
Xbox as well, can confirm.
---
If that drum could collect rain water (dirty water) whenever it rained it would also be awesome. Currently trying to find a water body in the savage to set up my camp. This would make that task much less painful
---
that &gt; mostly &lt;  is exactly what i am talking about :) it's rare, but it keeps me on the edge. oh and that random lvl 40 glowing moleminer with a rocket launcher haha. i should invest in fireproof...
---
Nuke me with plasma grenades
---
I was wondering maybe OP meant ‘explosive’.
---
if the actual tenderizer ever drops, never scrap it!
---
Fun for 3 days after that redundant and boring thank god I paid 10$ for it
---
Definitely get stabilized 3 under intelligence
---
Shotguns constantly proc luck of the draw so breaking isn't an issue.
---
I got it once and I’ve put the peppered mod on it, it does like 190 damage, my new favorite weapon lol
---
Come back at wastelanders or change up your build
---
imo the main thing killing shotguns is the damage glitch
---
He’ll keep going until you do it then just don’t go back, there’s nothing there anyway, I’m sure if the other daily’s had audio people would complain about them too, I’m actually annoyed at the amount of times heart of the enemy pops up as well as the revived return the red rocket protectron cores
---
Don't we all hahaha.
---
if you're wearing pa your a loot bag. I'm making a living off you so will others
---
Cordless VII is also good for camp building vids. [Here's a nice player home build.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZFObUa4wYI)
---
"Ah, thanks."
---
"Wait THESE ARENT MINE!!"
---
"GET BACK HERE!"
---
Ooh very nice, don't think I've seen anything from him 76 related yet
---
Pretty much anything is better than a two shot explosive, you need to be in their face to do any damage. Aside from the obvious bloodied build id say furious, anti armor (great for pump and double barrel), vampire and medic all make good prefixes along with instigating. Instigating will be largely wasted in group areas since it’s unlikely you’ll be hitting enemies at full health. Medic is only good for a critical build otherwise it’s useless.
---
The unmarked airport south of the first map also had tons of loot out in the fire! Found this during the first day NW got introduced. Found it after a rage-induced decision following a stupid death last match, ended up being rewarded with 2 .50 cals, and a grenade launcher for my friends.
---
They over-nerfed shotguns and called it a ‘fix’, because of how badly they were abused in survival mode. Dumbass dupers ruined all the fun.
---
My explosive double barrel shotgun seems to work wonders when I'm mid air using marsupial jumping.
---
Even more loot in arktos than two airports
---
I got the weapon. Not the plan.
---
A buddy of mine used shotguns exclusively and he absolutely shreds things
---
Base damage should be raised.  It's fine that there's no armor pen perks for it.  Makes sense actually.  Add a receiver option for firing slugs and for fletchettes (slugs are single projectile with 35% pen, fletchettes are 5 projectiles with 35% pen). Add option for rifled barrel which increases accuracy for slugs but decreases range and accuracy for others.  And just like that, shotguns would be fun and viable, but still not op endgame items.
---
Bloodied melee build running in full health... where is the blood bro? 😂
---
I just started playing again this week and was wondering why my shotgun was acting so terribly. 
---
I thought maybe it was just me.
---
Ah, gotcha. Still, so kind of them!
---
I think he got the pole trick with the L-shaped half floors from Davey, not sure. He mentions it in the vid, but it's been a while since I saw the whole thing.
---
Definitely. My shotgun build has 2 ranks in enforcer, and I can completely cripple a deathclaw of any level in 2 shots EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. not even close to a threat anymore.
---
Welp let's see what makes it through the chronic memory loss... I *think* the nicest thing another player has done for me was when I was playing a newbie alt and they handed me a nice legendary laser pistol with affixes for a healer/medic type build, and I wanna say the pistol is level 50 but I can't remember. The char was (and still is) a vats-pistols build, but even though my target build isn't for medic with him, I knew I wanted to play a medic at some point. Just today I finally created madam medic and handed the gun off to her so it can wait in her stash for 50.
---
I have vague plans to go automatic weapons with her, and I can't remember if a laser pistol/rifle can be modded automatic, but the majority of her target build isn't solo-dps-related anyways. (Now if I can just venture beyond my usual avoidant tendencies, she'll be useful.)
---
The most likely issue is a bug that occurs when you play nuclear winter as the last thing before the next daily rollout, or the first thing you play after the rollout.  I had it happen several times after not touching NW and heard similar stories that this bug also triggers if you have to do a hard reset, but can’t confirm.  I lost the opportunity to get several repeat survival mode weapons because of it.
---
I think he meant a new type of scrip as in perk card scrip. Kind of like nuclear winter
---
I was somewhere around the mid 30 levels. I just accidentally learned the lesson of "if someone owns a workshop, base game locks now belong to them and you will get a bounty for picking other locks on the property" lesson. I ditched my junk and then went to look for someone to kill me and remove the bounty. I figured the vault gets plenty of spawns, so i went there to let some noob toon kill me and get the bounty. A Lvl 100+ showed up so i stated cycling the 'Help', 'Shooty Fingers' &amp; 'Thumbs up' emotes (No Mic) He stared at me for a moment and then dropped a legendary .50 cal for me... Of course I picked it up because it was better than anything i had but then I started my emote pattern again trying to convince them to kill me. They stared at me a little while longer... and then dropped 500 rds of .50 ammo and then fast traveled away. FML. Sometimes the FO76 community is TOO friendly. After that I fast traveled to WhtSprng station. 1st person I came across, shot me once, and then stared at me. I gave them the thumbs up and they proceeded to kill me. Good Samaritans come in all shapes and sizes with many different purposes.
---
omg those stupidly and randomly exploding robots give me nightmares sometimes..
---
In my experience people show up .. I've never failed  a chip cash in ..thought one time it didn't alert the server and me and my buddy had to 2 man it.
---
Mysterious stranger. Makes killing higher level enemies take less ammo.
---
"Without resorting to legendary farming" no dude. OP is def asking to trade perk cards in for script to roll for legendary wepons. And im so against this.
---
Memory loss? Friend, are you okay?
---
But that's so kind of that player. I hope you can level up all your characters and make their builds work for you!
---
F*ck Grahm.
---
Is this a console only feature then? Does it specifically say Menu Music or similar?
---
I scrapped one during the last Meat Week but kept this one, but it may not last long since it takes up so much space.
---
No plan for the tenderizer, only plans for the mods, salt, pepper, spicy
---
Indeed. Got so much acid I need to get some lead ore to make best use of it.
---
I'm wondering the same thing
---
Keep the ideas coming hopefully we can convince bethesda!
---
Why not just give all perk cards a value of 1 and let the max value of cards for X be set at Y. 
---
For example if you want max rank 3 card, you need 3 copies of it.
---
Also another great idea here.
---
Crazy only lvl 30s an 1 or 2 people who dont know what to do show up 10 times I've tried. Never finished it once
---
Any extras I get are going to be sold for caps
---
Reading all of this makes me scared... played with shotguns since the begining and just encountered this bug last night, hopefully for the last time!
---
Yeah plus just moving a point feels really worthless too.
---
Depends on the reason I had to move some so I had 4 in charisma and it was hard as shit
---
They've already confirmed it's gonna be apart of adventure like everything else.
---
I failed it solo the first time, partly because he seems to teleport between phases sometimes. So he'll be up the street and dying when you thought he was right beside you. I don't actually remember what exactly happened to fail the thing that time, but I do remember it was particularly crappy and perhaps a glitch that did it. So I avoided that event like the plague.
---
Very recently, I tried it again as there was a 300ish (I think, I forget) person working on it already. By the time we finished, there were four or five of us and thankfully nothing glitched out terribly, but he did teleport a couple of times which is how I know he does it.
---
It's basically an overhaul of the overworld with places becoming settled.
---
If I remember rightly it's from a terminal in the garahan hq?
---
Faction wars would be so fecken amazing, the only issue I have with the idea whatsoever is how broken the PVP meta is
---
Was that in an Inside the Vault?  Or some interview?
---
Lead belly. Just drink from the steams and sell all the radway.
---
The daily is fun, but our boi Biv deserves more love. Always so happy to see us. Maybe something like Distinguished Guests but we gotta prepare the Ultimate Frat Party.
---
Idk I just need more Biv in my life.
---
Samezies.
---
Gamma guns, but you gonna have to be like Han and shoot first.
---
That is really nice actually
---
The build area is a cylinder that also stretches through the ground, so you can get more height by placing your camp module on a tall structure like a tree.
---
I wish the area would actively move as you build so that you can use as much of the build area as possible without having to replace your camp module.
---
Thats where you get the schematic, I need the materials, like screws
---
I had to mute my game for her quest line because she just kept talking lol. I like that she had so much thought and personality in her but her voice got on my nerves. I feel bad for saying that because I'm sure her voice actor is a lovely person lol
---
How is this constructive
---
There are Litterly hundreds of thousands of places to check and smooth. And yes fo4 NV fo3 all had the same.
---
Ahhh I remember now, Mole miners! They drop stuff you can scrap into the stuff you need
---
Atom shop special - 2500 atoms.
---
In comparison I feel as tho my understanding peaks at `Gun pretty, fire gun'.... 😉
---
Use a gamma gun or radium rifle since their rads are already really high. Maybe pumpkin grenades. Use tank killer also. But bloodied builds arent as effective in PvP these days because of the damage cap.
---
Youtube
---
Farm the fans, toy cars, giddy up buttercups. It takes a while but when you play figure out what junk items gives what scrap and plan on doing nothing but farming scrap the while game.
---
Ah, so I’m not the only one getting blue screens... I’ve not seen much talk about them, but some days I’ll have 3-4 blue screens, some other days I won’t see them
---
Cool ideas but the main issue I see is that most people would flock to the BoS and Enclave, and maybe the raider factions. I highly doubt that the free states or responders etc would ever have a chance at winning anythibg lol
---
Nuke Grafton?
---
Join a community group or make one. If you are on xbox then you could join my group called the Enclave Armada (we are chill and care somewhat of lore)
---
I do the cook out but primal cuts is boring as hell now, all that effort for a measly 15 trade in scrip...no thanks
---
I know a lot of people run with both, I always go bloody mess, I like how it’s just a improvement on my damage all the time regardless of weapon, hits or time limits
---
So as we’re fighting them off and their killing off the NPC and tearing down the settlements, then what because it seems useless to make them non killable and what about nuking their settlements or griefers killing the npc cause there assholes.
---
The last 3 cookout have been dead. Different servers too.
---

---
 When wastelanders comes out in the fall it’s almost going to be a whole new game. So everyone will see all the NPC even when you come out the vault. They don’t plan on altering the original game at all this will just be added on to it. “We’re not going to remove or radically change the existing content.” said Gardiner. You’ll still be able to just everything as before. This **mode** is meant to bring new and old players back into the game.
---
Hmm couple of queen spawns in the bog. They come with a little of everything.
---
Must depend on the day and time. Iv seen crowds at the cook out. But, I cannot actually get the prime meat because there's never enough help to actually complete prime cuts in time.
---
He hasn't had it for me yet. And I need it. I got a 3* instigating meat hook I think will put in good work at vault 94.
---
Bloody mess for every character.
---
👌
---
I found that a pneumatic chest mod and actually blocking now and again makes it a non-issue
---
My character haven't lost his head since then either.
---
Yes. Still can't put my Jangels The Monkey out. I can display the bears &amp; cats , but no monkey?
---
Death claws yes, right now yao guis are harder to kill than death claws, and that doesn't seem right.
---
You've given me the urge to redo my camp now. Amazing.
---
Edit- typo
---
What prices are you charging for your scrap?
---
My guess is that they couldn't do that because of the super duper perk. Its probably better to force you to roll the dice every time. I'm still on your side though.
---
Yeah this actually makes it a little bit better than the handmade.
---
I would rather fight a level 76 death claw than a level 76 bear yeah death claws need to be buffed
---
With the damage cap bloodied is about the worst build for pvp, speaking as a bloody build you could just flap your hands in my general direction to kill me.
---
I suppose savage could be used to describe anything that's brilliant or great like that beer was savage or the match last night was savage, I'm from Ireland if that helps ease your worries about being old as you could just be out the loop.
---
I think it will be the same as they added dungeons or even new buildings and decorations ... with patches on the main map.
---
What I thought I understood that cities or something like that would be instantiated so that the interactions and such are according to the progress of the group leader ...
---
What scares me if that does not cause unnecessary loading screens, extra loading time as the additional content added and above all ... new bugs.
---
If they do well ... I suppose they replaced the current map with an updated one (and therefore with less extra changes and loads), hopefully offering less problems in the loads ... and if they have sufficiently updated their "instantiate" form ", they could solve the problems of vault 94 and public events so that it does not generate lag on the server and other problems.
---
Come on, do not expect new mode or abysmal changes in the mapping ... but surely there will be the inclusion of new enemies, redistribution of enemies and redesign of areas.
---
Each pellet that hits has a chance to proc stuff like enforcer. I run a pure melee build with enforcer. If I can cripple its legs and arms, I can kill it at my leisure. I use a double barrel because they have the best accuracy and the most pellets
---
The laggy servers and the lack of participants make primal cuts fail often.
---
But … doesn't that mean it's not … free?
---
I honestly do appreciate the info on them doing 5$ presale though. I've always had to pay full upfront as to not have them lose money if I don't decide I want it.
---
Thank you! I've actually been thinking about moving and doing a farmhouse build because I want to make use of Aronholt's Homestead, which is just down the road from where I'm currently camped. :D
---
Yea, I’m a 1H melee build as well.  
---
Sometimes, you just have to play with the “fun” weapons - guitar sword, war drum, etc.
---
Tenderizer will likely be one of those fun weapons for me...
---
T-T Thank you so much for taking a look!
---
&lt;3 Thank you!
---
I know, right? Like omg. How could people expect you to be able to repeat something after you've learned how to do it ... gah!?
---
Yeah, if the MISC tab had a submenu called "Keyring" and all your keys went into that... like previous Fallout games. It would do wonders for cleaning up the MISC tab.
---
I have the mutation where you shock attackers. I was clearing out enemies from someone’s camp and I shocked the area and destroyed something at the camp accidentally which made me wanted. A random high-level player said he’d kill me and guard my dropped loot. I agreed and he didn’t run off with loot or anything, he waited for me to respawn and collect my stuff.
---
The last 2 days have cure me from that "event", most of the times prime cut did not spawn any legendaries, the few times it did they either got oneshotted or had some 1\* crap. That's not worth the hour long work for the 3 scrip at Grahm's. I'd rather run WestTek 6 times for less ammo and more and better loot.
---
An angel among us
---
in FO4 i used to store all my beer and nuke colas in the ice machine so i always knew where they were...
---
Made a report just now, I hope they fix it because this is beyond annoying...between me and my fiancé we have all the recipes and we make them for each other...now he’s having to buy the recipes I had because I can’t craft them anymore :(
---
Yeah buddy! I had a non-explosive but it wasn't the same. That explosive splash is legit.
---
I find that Primal Cuts is also a serious ammo drain.  I'm forced out of melee both to let other players have a share of the kill, and because there simply isn't time to reach enemies before everyone else kills them (the irony is not lost on me).
---
maybe an item called a keyring that opens in your inventory to browse your keys
---
Bloody Mess for sure, it'll boost your overall damage. Adrenaline is nice to have, but once you one shot every anyways it gets pointless.
---
Thank you for all the insight guys! I'm trying to figure out a build now if any of you guys are good at that. Trying to do build something that does Energy Weapons, Power Armor, and crafting. :D
---
In my case-both! Now, while my STASH is always on the edge of full so I don't often have weapons stored to give away myself, to return the favour, if I see a newbie coming out of the Vault, i put on my Responder uniform and head there. Give as much water, food and healing as i can, and at least escort them to the Overseer CAMP near Flatwoods. Or if I'm passing the CAMP i swing by and drop whatever in the STASH there.
---
Try other guns--I bet they stop working as well once you experience this with the Tesla. This is a known bug with the Tesla and Flamer (and maybe others). Doesn't matter what kind of Tesla rifle, the mods on it, or whether it's legendary or not. All can cause this issue. The only short-term fix is to reconnect; the only long-term fix is to never use these weapons until Bethesda fixes them.
---
I think this event is server based... Meaning someone gets to it before you.
---
While doing this with other players you can see them taking stuff out of containers. So I think its like the gym weights and have to get a little lucky. The weights will respawn for you but if someone recently loaded the area they are not there.
---
Only thing i can think of.
---
I'm currently lvl 58 and am just now getting those lonely feelings. I just want to finish the main quest but I'm afraid of assaultrons so I haven't even attempted to solo launching a nuke. I'd also really like to check out the vault raids. I'm thinking of moving my camp just so I have something to do. I've kept it in the same place since lvl 20 and I've unlocked so much since then. With the bigger budget I have now there are so many options.
---
I dislike the CAMP clause. A good portion of people who love their camp to death wouldn't participate because they'd be forced to pack up their CAMP under this model. Which is a shame, Faction War is a good mode.
---
I do the same thing! Responder buddies. 😊
---
Never ever ever going to happen, because it will be onto walls ceilings and whatever else and there game, engine, server, or whatever else cannot handle it. Then there is the issue on what people will draw on there armor and walls. I'll leave your imagination to that.
---
That would explain the weights too. I go to the penitentiary and Charleston fire station for all lead from the weights but half the time they are not there
---
People complained endlessly that scorched beasts were too hard, so they got nerfed.
---
I agree though. They are meant to be hard.
---
Even if they steal kills you still get prime meat... and then at the bbq you get cool stuff! Plus scrip!
---
Just curious  I’m not disagreeing but... is it because you feel they still need more time mutate from rads  or because of the events of one of the earlier games cause for the life of me I can’t think of something that made them stronger?
---
\-Deathclaws should be waaaaaaay more deadly and have a more stealthy approach. Stalking you and hunting in a groups would be cool. Also would love to see the return of Deathclaw young like NV.
---
\-Super mutant behemoths Should be way more deadly especially to non PA users, and for PA users getting picked up and thrown should be a thing. Maybe also let them throw mini nukes occasionally.
---
\-SB sonic attack should get a huge damage buff but move slower so they can be dodged, and landing should be more common with upped damage in addition to a fling attack.
---
\-Mirelurk Queen should have different hatchlings like explosive ones, young mirelurk kings that are easier to kill but faster moving and slight damage boost (being swarmed by these little fucks would be fun)
---
\-Grafton monster should be tougher over all like a mini behemoth but its ranged sticky tar attack should slow down the players movement, in the area of effect giving the monster opportunity to attack.
---
\-Flatwoods monster should buff enemies that are under its control and telepathically cause heads of its thralls to explode with bone shrapnel.
---
\-Sheepsquatch is pretty good but needs to charge you more. Seems like it just doesn't like to get up close whenever I fight it.
---
\-Mothman needs somthing...
---
\-Beavers need to launch entire logs out of their mouths one hit KOing anything.
---
\-squirrels...                 ....atomic acorns...
---
\-Foxes need twin tails that they can helicopter around with.
---
\-Chickens should explode and mutate into a T. Rex.
---
\-Graftons Mayor should transform into Preston Garvey and shoot settlements that need burying from his eyes.
---
\-And I need to stop.
---
Meat week can be hard. Take away sneak bonuses and see people running for thier lives. If they ever make hardcore mode id love to have no sneak 3x stuff. You would still use sneak to get in close but man it's a nice challenge.
---
I mean you don’t see any posts about people needing help killing enemies, not mirelurk queens or scorch beasts
---
Courier six disliked that
---
How do I exit vault 76?
---
Yeah we really need this, would make trading in the game so much easier, now unless you use a courier it’s all on trust, and we all know what humans are like!
---
word, and so we can display our Power Armor also.
---
Going to agree with the other folks here in that Bloody Mess x3 is a foundational build staple, regardless of build type. Applies to all damage, regardless of how it's delivered. Hell, if you could fart on an enemy, then add +15% fart damage to that.
---
When it comes things like Adrenaline or Gun Fu I'll put in one point only. It's enough to get the benefit of the perk without over investing in something b/c you end up 1-shotting most everything in PVE land anyway.
---
Ah, thanks.
---
It was a bad system for an RPG but pretty good for an online game. You’re right, they should have used it.
---
Just like FO4. Easy-peasy :)
---
Thats cause even if they should be there for you the game loaded someone elses exterior cell.
---
Go to vault tec and check the weighs there. If you got all 3 sets and only valut tec ones show up you may have to hop.
---
Breach and clear is similar and unique with containers not being instanced to each player.
---
I especially love the sign.
---
I want this so bad... is asked on Bethesda community post and they told me to please send a feature request.. now for the life of me I can’t find that option on their site 🤦🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️😊
---
That and you get so many items sometimes the rest are "..." and I'm like ok I dunno what the ...was cause I got so much shit before that event
---
Screws -  Robco (hard), WV Lumber (easy), &amp; National Isolated Radio Array (Med) have a lot of screws.  I find if you loot these places completely, you'll get a lot of screws (get the fans/typewriters) springs are plentiful at Robco too (clipboards).  
---
Black Titanium - Farm mole miners and ore (need acid to convert to titanium).  Welch Station has lots of both and they are rather low level. My first excavator I used a workshop (bad idea) to get the titanium then discovered ore smelting and that was way faster and easier.
---
TSE gatling is great.  Solid damage, pretty accurate.  I use it all the time.  Grats!
---
I feel like this is the perfect solution
---
Exactly what we need, more absurd fucking melee weapons. Hooray.
---
You should've pretended to be gay to really freak him out.
---
Whats a good level
---
Good luck if using explosive shotgun half the time I injure myself
---
That is definitely a unique way to build a wall, I dig it.
---
I started looking through the Atomic shop thinking I’d missed a wallpaper. It did look good.
---
I’m running a bloodied build but I definitely only tag enemies. Those who take the kills in only a few shots are the guys ruining the XP gain for everyone else.
---
Never knew they were needed but I used only shotguns through lvl 50 and had other concerns with them. The main one is ammo. No matter how much I farmed Mole Miners and materials, I always ran out of ammo. The shotty just didn’t do the dmg necessary to make up for ammo consumption. And crafting shotgun ammo felt much less rewarding than any other ammo type mostly because of the plastic necessary.
---
Now I will say that no other weapon in the game has the cripple potential shotguns have. They shred! Each bullet has a chance to proc the crupple effect from the Enforcer perk. Seriously, nothing takes more than 2 shots to cripple. Then you can take your time watching whatever enemy dares to challenge you crawl around like a worm.
---
Anyway. I got so fed up with always running out of ammo that I did the dirty and made the quick switch to a melee build. I’ve never gone back. Melee is just too much damage with nearly no drawbacks and never worrying about ammo. Even if the gameplay is significantly less fun.
---
Edit: not trying to bash on all guns here. I have a lvl 40 rifle character and a lvl35 pistol build. Ammo is much easier to farm and craft for both of these than shotguns were.
---
Huh??
---
k
---
The durability needs a huge buff. I think it only takes me 4 or 5 mags (I use the drum barrel) on my explosive combat shotgun and I need to repair it.
---
Yea I totally get it, however all you have to do is place it again (for free). I'm sure there's a better way of preventing people from placing camps before joining the warzone. It's just something I came up with very quickly. I'll think of something better :). Also, feel free to help me out here. I'd love a good brain storming.
---
Yall are crazy, the reddit hive mind is crazy about this game. You people bitch, moan and complain about youtubers who havent played the game criticizing it saying it isnt fair to criticize a game you havent played and then immediately in the same fucking breath attack someone who has played the game for a good bit of time saying they didnt enjoy it. You dont want "legitimate" complaints about the game because whenever someone makes one you change the bar for what a "legitimate" complaint is. Like jesus fuck, this comment is only partly directed at you and mostly at this subreddit as a whole, ive played since beta and this entire subreddit just rehashes the same 4 talking points and says shit like "well its a lot better than it was at launch" like yeah a D is a better grade than an F but its still not a good fucking grade! I used to enjoy coming to this subreddit but every thread is the same, every day the same shit is posted and you guys just sit here jacking off each other talking about "look at all these improvements bethesda has made" when the 300th pretty hat was added to the atom store. 76 is a fun game, there are a lot of things about it to like but christ this has got to be one of the worst groups to be a part of.
---
got myself a weightless shovel I can store it without regret or shame
---
You can put custom names on weapons and armor. So, if you name the stuff you normally carry with you, then you’ll know that everything else needs to be scrapped/sold/stored etc. Just a workaround suggestion, if you wanted to try it. I like to start all my custom names with a number, this forces them to sort to the top when sorted by name. Alternatively, I believe if you use punctuation for the first character, they will sort to the bottom. An underscore is good for this.
---
I'll have to get a shotgun, but I'll try it. (Unfortunately I'd have to switch my cards every time I encounter one 😂)
---
Very few folks are intentionally seeking PVP if they run a Bloody build these days.
---
That said, with the near term end of Survival mode, you may get to ensnare a lot more Bloody builds at the workshops into PVP if that is your goal. If so, aim for delivering Rads or look at Executioners prefixes to put some hurt to the already overly irradiated Bloody folks.
---
Exactly it’s so frustrating to see their health bar drop to 0 only for them to keep on attacking you.
---
It's not the fucking point. The point is they are stealing xp I couldn't fucking care less about the prime meat.
---
Xbox has a really good LFG system
---
I searched junk containers (lockers, green footlockers, wooden boxes) for a long time and never saw it or any other instruments. I saw that comment that they can come from junk nodes too but I've not found any instruments in nodes.  The mouth harp, triangle, pre-war lamp (I think there's an unlootable one in whitespring shopping area), High-Powered Microscope and clean tea kettle are all things I'm still searching for.
---
I don’t know much because I’m just now testing it. Seems to work really well with a shotgun. Getting a crit  every two shots with just 1 point in it.
---
Un level than loose a special and a perk/rank.
---
Do not pass go and do not collect 200$
---
I’ve found good weapons like that too. What is that? Is it from last person to use the machine?
---
It's really upsetting to me that so many people despise one of the greatest characters in the entire franchise because of a buggy game mechanic.
---
No animation, other than the sound of the crit bar filling. It procs between 30-50% for me, I think. 
---
I don’t use crit savvy myself.
---
Thanks for the response! I believe it can proc for any pellet for shotguns. That’s why quick hands is a really good perks for shotguns
---
Where is this located? Über nice!
---
All-American is great, but we've already got two separate 5.56mm ARs and one is objectively inferior, while the other is the best automatic in the game. So I hope they'd think of a way to make the All-American set itself apart without being just a straight upgrade.
---
Otherwise I'd love some weapons that fill in new spaces, like the .45 or 12.7mm Pistols, or the 9mm SMG (or .38 if we're sticking with in-game ammo). At Quakecon they showed concept art for the Plasma Caster coming with Wastelanders, and I'm really looking forward to that.
---
There is no animation with it. I ran 1 point before going full crit savvy and it's noticeable. Right now my laser rifle fires so fast that im stacking crits pretty fast... But i think that perk really shines on guns that are not so good in vats. Like a rifle.
---
Nice to have and kinda middle of the road perk. You don't count on it.
---
EDIT: also prob more geard to a low luck player who has a long time between crit bar fill up.
---
I don't know if you're still looking for one, but I just tamed one on the main road in the Mire, just north of Thunder Mountain power plant
---
Fast forward to wastelanders, 80% less spawn rate. 80% fewer fissure sites.
---
Yeah im still looking thanks
---
It existed before NW. The useless support linked me to an article to follow for updates when I bitched about it. It was last updated in MARCH. They've been "investigating" the bug for nearly 7 damn months. They don't give a shit, they want us to buy atoms.
---
So deathclaws are actually a pre-war military project rather than just a random mutation from the radiation like most other massive creatures. Supposedly, The Master spent time (after the events of FO76) refining them using FEV to make them stronger.
---
Maybe it's the wrong time of day, but twice I've done Prime Cuts solo....failed both times.  Melee though, so I have to cover a lot of ground.  Those damn mole rats though!
---
Team Corgi or bust, amirite?
---
Whats the stars on them?
---
The game only saves your character intermittently. I think the default is every 10 minutes. PC users can modify this setting but even so, with a super rare drop you run the risk of crashing, getting disconnected, blue screening if you're on PS4, etc.
---
By quitting to the menu you force a save and secure your precious loot.
---
Same. Actually thinking about it now they could add the red glare so there’s something else that uses missiles and still be neat.
---
Big Freds BBQ shack.
---
Where is this??
---
Set up a camp in Flatwood Monster territory and the little bastard will pop up more often than not. My previous camp, not far from Johnson's Acre was a bit of a magnet...
---
Weekly challenges are easy this time, especially with Meat Week events going on nonstop. Send team invites to randos until someone finally accepts, and then do events like a madman. Don't forget the booze, either. Taking workshops is also a good way to farm quests and events if you get tired of meat, the initial claim workshop quest counts and then it always spawns a defend workshop event like two minutes later.
---
Oh and scrapping junk you bulk counts for that weekly challenge, you just lose out on some plastic in the process.
---
It's nice how much overlap there is for melee and heavy. Until I was able to stockpile lots of ammo I had a good melee weapon at all times to save bullets.
---
The ones I have Cav/End Metal LL, AP/Durable BOS LA, FDC/Disease Chest.
---
Might have to try that out thanks. I’m really tempted to start spending points on shotgun perks. Bloodied heavy gun build now so would not have to move too many perk points.
---
Big Fred’s BBQ
---
Wow, memory is failing me clearly, lol. Thanks for answering 🙏
---
Ty!
---
It’ll be like what happens when you nuke Prime Cuts. Nothing changes.. immortal characters will stand there not dying, and instanced characters will respawn later. The structures will remain intact just like current game structures do.
---
Ok. Haven’t had that problem. I will do that from now on. Thanks.
---
So it’s a mode? Like survival? But not survival?
---
That’s the only way it can work.
---
Do both
---
Yeah I still have a loading pic, I took a selfie with the guy that disnthe mod for me. Super cool guy, Silune.
---
Heart of the Swamp you can only kill it at certain times... so maybe the same thing could happen.
---
I used to play like crazy now I work all the time and I dumbly spent all my atoms on sales right before they introduced wall paper (praised be Zed) however with my schedule it feels like it will take me a year to grind up enough
---
While running gunsmith?
---
It's pretty unlikely that it will happen but for a while the servers were crashing a lot. If you get something truly special I'd do it just to be sure.
---
Mirelurk Queen got me twice yesterday...lol
---
Quakecon panel. They discussed it at length.
---
As a PvP player that just wants to be able to find like-minded prepared opponents, this is not exactly what I'd want, but I'm definitely supporint the idea anyway - especially the notion of providing PvErs noncombat alternatives to contribute to the cause.
---
1500 atoms
---
Also let us display Jangles the Moon Monkey
---
As much as I want to carry him around and show him the Earth (as he is from the moon), I’m scared I’ll one day accidentally scrap him. For now he stays in the stash, waiting for the day he’ll get to tell my CAMP visitors stories about the moon
---
Lol. No, the servers crash on me all the time. I just meant I never lost a legendary from it.
---
Must be nice. I’m off and on the PS4 and switching servers while collecting stuff. I was on for hours on Friday and Saturday night.  
---
I rarely see anyone doing the meat week events. Most prime meat events are untouched.
---
Yup...that’s been my experience for the past 2-3 days.
---
The wallpapers managed to put me at zero atoms, but I've managed to bounce back to about 350 by then, not even doing the challenges that slavishly. And fwiw the wallpapers aren't timed, so you have a few months before they get vaulted (and presumably new wallpapers take their place).
---
Nice
---
yeah recently happening a lot to me as well (ps4)  the worst one was when i went in to loot a farmhouse and the crate "dropped" behind me and blocked the way out.  i had to fast travel to same location lol
---
724 hours in I got my first TSE.  A single action revolver.  That was a week ago, and I still have mixed feelings.  But I got 2 more and a bunch of other nice explosive drops in the last few days so I'm not going to complain.
---
Got the spicy mod plan. No tenderizer yet.
---
Bloody chef hat.
---
If you're on PS4, I'll give you stuff
---
1 point in adrenaline for 60% of its 5* power, 3 in bloody mess
---
I just found a decent server for once with about 6 people doing the cook out but my camp spot was taken. So hopefully I'm as luck in this next one.
---
It's mad though, i get there thinking it's gonna be rammed then the cook starts and I'm the only one there so have to server hop to find a decent group!
---
Sounds like more stuff to eat my camp budget, no thanks.
---
I wish I could conrtact someone to wallpaper my place but I don't think it works like that oh well will have to keep on trying
---
That’s pretty basic and doesn’t really affect how you approach the enemy. Maybe if I want real skill based play I’m just in the wrong game. There’s nothing wrong with that, different games full different niches. But it would be nice for the winner of a fight to not be the person with better armor and weapons,
---
I just love looking at people’s camps, very nice! My own imagination stinks. I have NO sense of design whatsoever.
---
Just buy one lmao
---
I think a lot of existing players are upset that there are no new rewards, and that there are not enough new players to fill in.
---
I don't even currently play the game. Haven't played since like a month after release. Your rant is entirely misdirected. The point of my comment was if a game gets your attention for 300 fucking hours it isn't a bad game. Period. LiKe JeSuS fUcK
---
Saying 300 hours was enough to realize "welp, that's it" was just such a bozo thing to say. 300 hours of keeping your attention and your response is "welp, that's it." Seriously? That's a response that should be directed to games with 5 hour long campaigns.
---
Wait... Trade offers already exist? Or am I misunderstanding, like a machine that makes it so you can trade without meeting each other?
---
I was lower level than what I am now. The guy game me a two shot explosive 3 star shotgun (back when those were God tier) 100 Nuka colas, 100 quantums, more than 200 stimpaks, some good armor, and a full set of ultracite power armor+backpack. 
---
Though he was a duper, and got kicked off of Fallout. I'm still friends with him, and occasionally ask him how he's doing.
---
I don't enjoy the game. Hence the complaint
---
Knowing how buggy stuff gets with Bethesda I'm sort of apprehensive about suggesting this... But how about just deleting duplicate keys automatically.
---
If you have a key, and you pick up the same key, don't add the key to your inventory.
---
Reinforced and BOS override the paint job.
---
Or maybe it's just really hard to see, you know... Being camo.
---
Yeah, I’ve got gunsmith maxed out. I think it’s mostly due to the bug where an enemy’s health goes to zero but then regenerates.
---
That is true, but stuck in the bed of a truck... or a mailbox that my arm has now merged with are my major complaints
---
I still have a 3* Vampires/faster fire rate/Agility Double Barrel I refuse to get rid of. I use to be pure Shotgun Build because of Enforcer, but now the damage healing bug is making it impossible to enjoy
---
It's a 3d world. Your going to get stuck just like everyother game.
---
Why not double check the objects they created before they implement them
---
Another good mats farming location is abandoned bog town. Go the the tall building and take the fire escape to the roof. Fall down the elevator shaft and you will be in an office area with a lot of typewriters fans and such.
---
This is me! I absolutely love the feel of shotguns in this game (and irl too), and I remember being blown away by seeing a really powerful one absolutely destroy a higher level enemy in one shot (was a lvl20 at the time) - and the sound of it shooting was so cool too lol. I used them and preferred them over rifles even as a lower level. I really wish I had been around when shotguns were more powerful than they are! I don’t like the regen glitch and hope they fix it, but despite that am keeping my build. I get told a lot to change my build and that there are better weapons but 🤷‍♀️ call it spite and love for a neat weapon
---
Lol. Oh man you must be new to the world of games.
---
Happens to the best of us. I was on my 3rd build with over 300 hours before I killed him.
---
I feel like it happens more than other games. I understand it happens from time to time. There's an acceptable limit and then a come on!, are you serious with this!?!
---
Bloody Mess is a lot of fun with shotguns most enemies will blow into bits. I really miss it now that I run Good with Salt for Meat Week.
---
I have had that problem a few days ago. As soon as I completed an event I got a 3 star suppressors explosive reduced weight pump shotgun then the game crashed and I lost it lol
---
You feel wrong. But go ahead and think what you want.
---
Just today I saw a level one come out of the vault, made them a souped up hunting rifle and have it to them at the overseer's camp. Then I helped a level three player at primal cuts to complete and he leveled up to 4. I was so proud of him. Then my husband and I went back to the overseer's camp and gave a level 5 about a hundred cool plans. That stuff makes my day
---
No, just disappointed by what's being produced. Borderlands doesn't seem to have as many issues. Other games built on the same engine don't have as many issues. Seems poorly produced, like they had to meet a release date and were just going to patch to completion. But now have semi abandoned finishing the game in favor of creating items to spend atoms on.
---
Wasn't this in FONV or 3?
---
Lol there it is... I see now.
---
You and your husband are my heroes. You sound like my kind of people. 😊
---
I personally want some Sierra Madre and Vera Keys stuff. Wasn’t the SM a place for people to store their fortunes and begin again. And Vera was a huge actress and starlet. But we get no movies or posters. 
---
Then again it’s a hard sell to talk about a place so far away and given the 25 years and all. 
---
Also a hard sell is the survivalist rifle and all American. One is in the hands of Clark who still is alive for another 22 years. And the all American is in the bottom of vault 34.
---
I want a way to be rid of all duplicate keys. I also want to get rid of plot holotapes. Once I listen to it, I should be able to drop it. I’m looking at YOU, Overseer Tapes!
---
Maybe to solve the stash problem, have a stash for Junk and a stash for the rest. Just a nice compromise.
---
I think it was FONV if I’m not mistaken
---
The 12.7 is heavily wanted. That and the plasma defender.
---
No, it’s a known bug.
---
You don’t hear that talked about a lot here, but you’re right.
---
 I’ve often thought, while waiting for my game to unfreeze from Pipboy lag, that a good chunk of people’s “lost” items could simply be menu lag in the heat of battle. It’s very easy to hit the wrong button while the menu is lagging and you’re jumping/reloading.
---
Like a system where you and another player would go to trade normally but instead of trusting each other to offer up at 0 it would be essentially a "trade box" where both players would enter the items they want to trade, lock that deal in with some sort of "confirm" text box with a yes or no option and once both players agree it would switch the items between inventories to make a item trade but instead of just being able to trade 1 for 1 make it so I could trade like a few stims or ammo and a piece of armor for 1 weapon I want
---
Possibly yeah. I got my second tenderizer just now, tried to sell it to other players after the cookout and out of the 6 or so people there, at least 3 of them already had one!
---
What system are you on?
---
Executioner’s gamma gun with fire rate and crippling. Yes.     Or irradiated legendary effect if we ever get it.
---
Deathclaw should be like an imposter. Agile, strong, really scary.
---
Aww gee, thanks 🤗
---
Concentrated fire 3; works better than intended for automatics.
---
YEs, love the camps that use this as a wall!
---
Severe increase in close up damage. Point blank damage should be BIG and fairly nonexistent at a distance.
---
Just checking in
---
'A whole new game'
---
I feel like you're setting yourself up for some serious disappointment.
---
Or maybe just mod options that make it that way.
---
Hey, yes add me. Psn Papertattoo
---
Bloody mess is for everyone. Not having it Is like saying you don't want that extra damage.
---
Yeah, I believe it was at the morgantown airport with the clear the scorched thing, I went there and a crate just fell on my head for no reason. Another time I was fast travelling to my camp and when I arrived a dead, lootless scorched beast just fell into my camp building (It had no roof at the time.)
---
Edit: I believe the supply drop coming from the sky for no reason bug is actually related to the scorched event based on other comments.
---
Wait, what?
---
I remember back when game 1st came out this was one of my fav event, nice exp cause all those ghouls you can just one shot and loads of loots if there are more than one people. Never failed it even if I am on my own
---
Morgantown Airport, in the Overseers chest on the second floor. They added it a few weeks ago, so if you have already gone there, just go back and snag it. It's nice for free, half the weight of the normal backpack.
---
I think the damage creep for some builds is just wildly broken and probably needs a nerf.
---
I guess it would be better PR to just buff all the enemies instead then ruin someone's precious bloodied marsupial build.
---
I never got one.
---
I want Deathclaws to KILL me! Like murder me!! Same with Queens and Behemoths. I want to run screaming.
---
Whoever wrote that article is a terrible writer (at least in English), and I don't know why anyone would take it seriously. Grammar is broken, entire words missing, contradictions, etc. Plus it reads like a giant kiss-ass session.
---
I've been running a raid everyday since it was released. The first and third are pretty fun especially if you're running it on standard or expert.  
---
I really wish they would let us scrip pieces of solar/thorn armor that we have no use for though. I've crafted around 10 pieces of thorn armor and they are all bad rolls.
---
How do I add again? It’s been a while since I did that
---
Totally
---
Yeah... yeah....
---
Im not sure if its a server issue or problem loading all items at once on the fly. But like many things, this should be fixed by now.
---
The ones that make junk lighter.
---
Lol what's yours?
---
Just sent a request, hoodsteel is psn
---
I think there are many ways to improve it overall, not just one thing... it’s called a DeathClaw for a reason... I don’t think anyone is scared in game of a DeathClaw... a bear... yeah those will mess you up...lol
---
I had those things follow me sound for a whole day! One landed on me and did a little damage. At least they could be full, but no, always empty. Yesterday I had dead molerats falling around me smh
---
Idk what it is but I had something similar happen to me the other day. Coulda sworn I downed a guy ( the little notification popped)  and then I killed his teammate. I turn around to kill the guy I downed and he was back up! He Killed me and won. We were the last 3 left alive so idk how this happened. Ps4 also.  He had wicked sketch name too. It was something like fyjkslnehyahcev25163 ,
---
Is that correct? Do you know that for sure? Genuine question.
---
If you are sure, do you know how it's worked out? Percentage, damage amount?
---
YYYYYYYYESSSSSSSSS!!!!
---
Agreed. I also don’t think there’s one way. I just don’t want enemies to be “harder” by being bullet sponges. Because that’s not very fun.
---
thanks for the heads up !!
---
Someone has to be bait. =P
---
All serious, if that happens, just focus on staying alive and let the pole sitter kill them. Just smack them enough to get credit for the kill then stay alive. Or hop up on the pole with them.
---
Been both, the guy in the pole just trying to tag shit to get that sweet exp as a level 40, and the one swinging like a madman because the Mole rat horde appeared.
---
agree
---
The combat shotguns break much faster than the pump do, I have hung up my TSE combats and only use my TSE pump now for that reason. It is quite a difference. I have reported it till the cows come home and I guess they just dont care?
---
We still can’t build this?? C’mon!
---
Wah wah wah
---
No, it's just I can't apply it to the armor anymore. And reinforced/BOS don't override it last time I checked
---
It visited my camp the other night, I couldn’t figure out why all of my turrets were glowing pink? Then I saw it.. A few shots with my anti armor handmade and it was toast. That was the 4th one now I have killed :)
---
*comic book guys voice*
---
Actually, the red glare used Rockets not missiles 
---
Worst comment EVER
---
This!
---
So be nice if that was said anywhere. Both my wife and I when we started playing would go to the SBQ and try as little level 30's, pour hundreds of rounds into her and get fuck all.
---
Couldn't tell if she was bugged or we weren't doing something right.
---
Also seems like if you're under 50, you get jack all.
---
Well I just said survivalist Rifle cause like who knows maybe it wasn’t so uncommon pre-war. All-American is way less of a stretch as you can get it in lonesome road and that’s because there are missile silos there and heavy military presence. It’d be so easy to just say,”oh yeah we have a couple of those stashed in the silos” or even the presence of the enclave bunker would support the all-Americans presence in Appalachia. Same goes for red glare. Actually stemming off from this there are protestors near grafton steel which means that riot armor could possibly canonically be in Appalachia.
---
I have an AA handmade too and have no doubt I could’ve killed it :(((((
---
They need to consolidate some perks so that more people will actually want to use them.  I usually run a sniper build but I would LOVE to be able to switch over to shotguns from time to time as a change of pace... except none of my rifle perks apply to shotguns and I don't have enough points in strength to equip all the relevant perks.
---
I'm about 99% sure than in previous games there was no distinction between shotguns and rifles but for some reason they split them off with their own perks and crammed them in Strength.
---
Known bug for a while now... It’s part of the shotgun problem.
---
Probably going to need you to send an invite
---
I'd run a classic shotgun melee if they let me.
---
Serendipity, Green Thumb, pharma farma
---
Agreed.  The inability to unbundle cards is annoying.  I have multiple sets of Demolitions Expert 1 set to share in a team (2 perk cards), 1 set to use regularly (3 cards), and 1 set (5 cards) for full grenade/explosive handmade fun. It would be nice to be able to keep it simpler.
---
Try to send again, I didn’t see the invite
---
No, I’m just being open-minded to the possibility
---
Since they gave her that insane explosive resistance she supposedly doesn't scale for more people, or so reddit has taught me.
---
SBQ isn't hard, she's just an irritating damage sponge. I've never been in imminent danger of dying during any SBQ event since launch, but I've seen the event failed a few times simply because everyone present couldn't do enough DPS in the time allotted.
---
Deathclaws do need a major buff. They're complete jokes now, I've seen radants kill them.
---
Nice!
---
Fair the survivalist rifle is 12.7 which is .50 so yeah you could see more but BGSA would have to tie it to a quest. The all American is a lot harder as it’s very limited number of them made. Even with enclave presence. The red glare could be a good unique model. 
---
And given that we know and are told M series weapons are stored on the west coast you’d have to sell that story really well to fit the lore.
---
What happened?
---
I play on Xbox and you have to cycle thru them (though you can scroll in either direction). Maybe PC has a hotkey feature but unlikely.
---
I dont think its up to anyone but the individual to say whether or not he thinks the game is bad. Putting time into a game isnt always an indicator of enioyment, I play plenty of games with my friends (like the commenter stated he has with 76) that I dont entirely enjoy and dont really play on my own, sorry for the rant as i said it wasnt really directed at you just more of the attitude of this sub reddit in general. I just hate this mentality of insisting that someone cant have a subjective lack of enjoyment about this game because "well you put this much time into it" its like, why do complete strangers insist they know better about how someone feels better than the person themselves?
---
The exact same thing happened to me but with combat shotgun, and I've bought the handmade plan three times and it still acts like I don't have it!
---
Had to switch to my main quick. Saud over mic but I guess you couldnt hear me?
---
Totally agree. Now THAT would be the real dick move if it was temporary.
---
Yeah, because only combat perks are relevant... smh
---
It's meant to be a choice as to what you have active on you. You know, like an RPG.
---
Better than dropping them the game shouldn’t accumulate them.
---
It's not that we need a trading system. We already have one. We just need the current one to be fixed to be more robust, not just be about item-for-cap exchange and have measures to prevent stealing and scamming (the main issue with the current system).
---
I want this but I ALSO want to be able to fill my empty metal shelves. I was hoping you'd be able to do that when they were talking about decorating the CAMPs before the displays were a thing...
---
What am I looking for
---
Also true
---
You need to repaint your torso so it's not tricentennial, then give it to me. I mode it and will sell it back @ 500c....mic would be easier. .
---
i didn't mean to click bait i was just going off of memory and ended up botching the video title
---
what i find very interesting is i tried to spread a video on the topic fallout 76 that i found very interesting so i decide to share it...i get overall a negative response
---
when juicehead shares it...it gets a more positive response
---
could just be the shitty title and again i was not trying to clickbait whatsoever but seeing how many people see me for even slightly bringing up hate for fallout 76. people are going to think i'm lying and i don't mind it's my word against theirs i guess 
---
in my opinion it seems as if they have tunnel vision they love the game so much most aren't willing to accept the fact that one of the main reasons fallout 76 was made was to be a cash cow and the game will probably never recover. look at battlefront 2 for example the game is actually really good now but even now it still has community problems there's nothing bethesda can do to make this better in the majority's eyes after fallout 76's launch
---
For today's roaches go to hemlock holes. And also im running around in the gear needed for the pic but no one seems wise to it.
---
If not drop dupe keys have it auto remove a dupe key when you pick it up.  
---
I have so many Alpha and Beta Security Key Cards from the Battle Bot event clogging up my MISC.
---
K how do I repaint it
---
Bethesda has said that you will be able to follow the original storyline, or just jump right into the new story content. So I think it's just a change to the current adventure mode.
---
In your power armor station.
---
I love the sound of this idea, I dont think its possible with the servers as they are and possible engine limitations, but an upvote either way because this would be cool as fuck
---
They should use the old survival servers to create a high level server where everything is max in all regions
---
They have to hotfix this right now we can't have Chally be broken!
---
You know the game's in a poor state when you have to beg for simple features present in past titles.
---
I have to go find one, I don’t have the plans for that yet
---
Going to head to the bunker
---
I just built you one
---
I waited three hours the other day and it never started, only on the 4th hour did one pop up, and after that primal cuts didn't start showing up for at least half an hour
---
I think I shot a robot
---
Yeah they really should let us scrap pieces of armor for like 4 recycled steel or something because garbage rolls do happen and it sucks especially when you're trying to get that Van Sent set lol I've only been lucky to get an exterminator cav piece as my best regular roll after I finish the strangler this week I'm gonna grind re-rolls myself and try to get better drops
---
It was fonv and a mod added it to 4
---
Wow, thanks man. Trying to figure out how to modify it
---
They used to be able to one shot a Scorch beast.. Ahh those were the days!
---
I dont think the game is in a poor state...
---
I agree, no place for this. I equally dislike everyone.
---
Lol go to modify then paint then select, I believe its prototype
---
How long will it take to mod it?
---
Well the dearhclaw on deathclaw island is lvl 21 so if ur under lvl 40 id say pop a floating platform past waters edge place all turrets on then play chicken by swimming to the island wait for it to spawn then haul ass bk across b4 u die. Then let ur turrets do there thing while u help in shooting it
---
This is a good idea or simply give a notice you already have this item cannot carry duplicates.
---
Yep, it could have been written as a parody - not only do the devs not use the existing display case, but they go to the trouble of adding extra cases so they can use those.
---
After I max out a certian weapon type then I slowly take away from it. Games so easy its not needed to be max out all the time. Enjoy your time and ditch adrenalin for marathoner and sprint thu the bog! Pve is stupid easy so I've been looking for comfort in my day to day. Sell all stims and chug nuka cola cherrys or whatever. I put lead belly back on and ditched all water. Mix it up and have fun with the more "food build" perks
---
I can still wreck pvp and go full tryhard if i need to
---
Then don’t tell people your sexual orientation.  I don’t see why this topic would come up while playing a game.  I see this as the problem - people get too personal while playing online.  Just play the game and don’t get personal.
---
I definitely agree that there seems to be a subset of people who will defend the game and the company no matter what.
---
Tell you what you handle the transaction and I’ll pay
---
Done. Hit R3 then buy
---
Ah, the Mire. Where night is actually night, as opposed to daytime with the sun behind a cloud.
---
If you read my post, even if I don't mention it (which I barely do) people still get 'offended' by my voice.
---
and I shouldn't have to hide myself, or not say something because of another's reaction. You're a part of the problem.
---
I don’t have a problem with what you’re into. Just don’t take my shit when I die and we’re cool
---
Then they are the ones with the problem.
---
I feel that’s all the SBQ is...
---
How does it work
---
Agreed.
---
Lol you got it.....triangle
---
you can spend the perk points better IMO
---
Why do you care so much about xp? Lol. You can get xp anywhere. It’s pretty useless at a point. Prime meat and scrip on the other hand...
---
What weapons do you use???
---
Radants do more damage to me than Deathclaws...lol
---
How do you stay up on the air lol? What are you looking to trade
---
Anonymity of the internet lets one say whatever they feel.
---
I don't give a shit what your sexuality/gender/preference or whatever the hell folks want to call it these days, but some people are just plain unable to accept things and use that anonymity to exploit their dislike or they just want to stir shit up.
---
I know I'm gonna get flak for this comment, but there are far more children/teens on consoles that want to be edgelords and that type of verbal abuse tends to be more common on those platforms. (Not saying this can't or wouldn't happen on PC, but demographics are a thing and consoles tend to be the choice for the younger and less mature audiences for multitudes of different factors)
---
I've been thinking about this for a while and yes, they need a buff. I have an AAE and a bloodied combat shotgun. Both are underwhelming with full perks.
---
Aside from fixing the health glitch, these would be my suggestions:
---
1. Bump base damage up 20-30% - they *should* hit hard
---
2. Reduce the spread some. There is a perk for this (Skeet Shooter), but it's still a little off.
---
3. Increase effective range. I would suggest adding/modifying barrel mods to do it.
---
4. Add slug capability with armor penetration/high stagger chance
---
5. Increase durability--it's horrible
---
As for the two shot modifier, I think it should be buffed for every weapon. I'm still on the fence about explosive. I tend to think it shouldn't add serious damage as it did before the nerf, but rather some damage and effects like stagger or even burning % chance.
---
I’m not telling you to hide my brother I’m just saying from experience that when you play online to keep it simple 👍🏻
---
Well you lucky the vending mechines dont charge you. Unlike Elder Scolls Online were guild members have to pay a big fee to sell something in a trader
---
I think you'd better get used to pop up quests as you walk through a place that say:
---
1. Find the source of the music.
---
2. Follow the strange blood trail.
---
3. Check why the painting fell off the wall.
---
4. See why the robot is gathering food.
---
All of these will then lead you to a door/button/cellar/rug that will have (examine) pop up on it so you can enter.  
---
There are unused doors and houses everywhere. There will probably be rich snobs in the mansions.  Ghouls in a cave somewhere. Bunkers under factories. Buildings that now have full interiors instead of half.
---
Those Ghouls got buffed so hard!
---
That would be interesting! Level 68 and up enemies all over! That would be cool!
---
I agree with this 100% I don’t give a shit about who you choose to love and don’t care to hear you explain your kinks... you wouldn’t want me to sit here explain how straight I am and how proud I am to be straight AND in the same sense I could care less about your orientation so just live your life and be happy.
---
They were weak ass in Fallout 4 too!
---
Yeah ik but I think that if Bethesda can cheese brotherhood in they can cheese anything in. I can probably come up with a compelling argument as to possible lore connections as to how all-Americans and riot armor can be added but like Bethesda has already put in broadsiders, harpoons, and the “one and only” cryolator in the game so really the only explanation we need is no explanation.
---
I would rather people steal kills then fail the event because time ran it while trying to make sure everyone got take non-legendary enemies. If you don’t care about prime meat/scrip go somewhere else.
---
thank you for understanding i'm glad i can have a reasonable discussion with someone without people getting out there pitchforks 
---
for example i got 8 downvotes on a reply simply saying "Yes." 
---
i didn't mind the downvotes i just found it pretty funny
---
Feather triangle. I dont use a jetpack so idk much other than building one. 
---
I got too much shit and wanted to hook ya up...are you really only using a spear?
---
LIKE I said, I never explained how proud I was, and I never explain my 'kinks', people are just hateful and ignorant.
---
There is no plan sadly
---
Well I have a Gauss rifle
---
No, you’re a part of the problem.
---
Even if the people muting/not talking to you are doing so because you are gay, that’s their choice.
---
You didn’t say they’re harassing you or insulting you.
---
They turned off their mics and won’t talk to you online?
---
Stop whining.
---
You’re not entitled to anyone’s attention and they do not have to speak with you if they don’t want to. Get over yourself.
---
Dude. I have kept it simple.
---
\&gt; the second I mention that I'm gay, even if it didn't come up 
---
Are you also a vegan? Just don't.
---
While I don't care if you like sausage or fruits, I'd also ditch anyone who tells me that in any circumstances where this is TMI.
---
I know the mysterious stranger that heals you when downed is fantastic! It replaces a life saving armor piece and it procs all the time. Super fun to share in a group.
---
I can't agree more, I love using shotguns in fallout games but in this game they feel like such a downgrade from both automatic and single action rifles. Shotguns should be good at close range, when I aim a barrel of a shotgun at a scorchbeast's head from point blank range I can't imagine how that would miss.
---
I feel like the general consensus is that nobody gives a shit about your orientation.
---
If people are annoyed with your voice then mute them/don’t associate with them.
---
If you go online then be prepared to meet assholes.
---
Nerfed? They were fixed, they're not supposed to perma stagger you with 30 sonic blasts a second!
---
Yes there r a couple of good ones but in general they suck
---
Read clearer - I meant even if I DO NOT mention it, people somehow still are able to pick apart my voice and go on from that.
---
Thanks man!
---
I think it’s more like if I guy talks about his girlfriend people would find that fine but if a guy mentions his boyfriend people go crazy. Has nothing to do with flaunting something. These things come up in casual conversation.
---
No, the problem is you hitting strangers, unasked I may add, with your sexuality.
---
You provoke the confrontation and now you are getting upset when they don't want to play with you. 
---
Keep your sexuality to yourself and just play.
---
If they work like any other world container, then they won't refresh after a certain amount of time, but only after **you** looted another 60 world containers. But if they follow the same pattern as plants / flowers in the game, they will become lootable again after 20 real-time hours.
---
So, which is it?
---
Deathclaws on F04 and F076 are weak even without legendaries and poorly with a poorly optimized build!
---
You didn't read my post correctly. I never clearly mention it. My voice is a bit effeminate and I get made fun of for that. I never blatantly tell people that I'm gay. But if someone asks, I will tell them. And even if I don't, it's still a problem.
---
It’s a bug... it’s been submitted already... they are addressing it...
---
Got everything last time meet week happened except the red firework mine. Got it 2nd cook out this time around 👍.
---
&gt;the second I mention that I'm gay, even if it didn't come up
---
It can't get any clearer.
---
Yea man. I do miss civil discourse, but what can ya do.
---
I’ve never seen that before
---
It was misspelled dude, read the comment above.
---
Can't say if I need much but we can trade sure. My name is YugenCloud.
---
Cause it's online gaming. While there are those who are immature or filled with hate, there will always be this kind of behavior. It's sad
---
Now you are become Death, the destroyer of worlds. Have fun and don't stay out too late!
---
A couple of my friends get hassled ever so often, since they're super open about their relationship and don't tend to hide anything when talking over the mic.
---
I'm surprised you get hassled just for mentioning you're gay, let alone just for your voice.
---
If you were on Xbox my group would've been happy to let you tag along.
---
Got the red firework mine but still no tenderizer
---
Yeah that sounds good lol. Back to our roots. I think I'll take your advice. The pvp is so off the wall and I run solo, which means if I do pvp its 1v2/3/4.
---
EXACTLY. I'M TRYING TO HAVE A NORMAL CONVERSATION AND NOT BE HATED ON.
---
Brotherhood was a good show of it. It fits and really doesn’t break lore. When the BoS come east they are never going to find any of their gear/tech. It’s been too long. 
---
Most people believe that since Vault 111 opened almost a year after bombfall that its plausible that the plans for the cryolator made it out the vault. And given 25 years time. Info like that can easily spread. 
---
I think the all American should stay in NV too many Easter eggs and we’ll just make this NV2 
---
And riot armour imo should be in the game in the first place.
---
joke's on you, water doesn't render in my game XD
---
Yep. And that’s why I don’t really like the fight lol. But again, it just might be the wrong game for that kind of gameplay. This game is more of a looter shooter.
---
He’s not hitting on anyone. He’s speaking normally with a “gay-presenting voice.” His natural voice.
---
It’s like how certain African American voices sound African American based on verbiage and inflection. Or even as little as someone saying “y’all.” If someone turned off the mic every time someone southern or black got on mic, that would provoke some raised eyebrows, no?
---
&gt; high level areas 
---
so, south east?
---
tolerance is not the same as acceptance. of course you're free to say whatever you want, even if that's something neutral in an effeminate voice- just be ready for the backlash.
---
people are within their right to block you for being gay. if you want to avoid that, then yes, you do have to hide yourself. I hide things I know would put people off because I'm not one to shoot myself in the foot and then wonder why I'm bleeding.
---
The Spirit of Vengeance is strong in you. xD
---
Hate to say but no one can gift atoms belive me i tried to send some to a friend but Betheda dont do that unlike Zos with ESO
---
He just popped up for me at the Cranberry Bog primal cuts event - took control of the Fog Crawlers
---
Here’s my two cents: people are assholes. Jump servers and try again. I know it sucks, and I know it’s hurtful, but statistically you’re bound to find another LGBT+ individual or individuals (there are dozens of us!) on there. Lots of allies, too. It’s why LGBT community solidarity is so important, because some people are uncomfortable or downright homophobic. 
---
Pass on the haters, find the friends.
---
I use shotguns for no other reason than they're fun to use. I use shotgun builds in other games where possible for the same reason - they're just fun.
---
Being the lowest DPS by a huge margin in my group wasn't fun.
---
That's something I always wondered what they did differently from f4 to f76. In f4 storing everything in 1 stash box made the game lag horribly every time you'd open it, same thing in skyrim, f:NV, f3, and oblivion.
---
Categorizing loot in different stash boxes reduces the lag upon opening them cause the list is smaller to load into the game.
---
So I wonder what's different between f4 and f76 stash box?
---
Not hard there are a ton of YT vids telling how to do diffrent styals of camp builds including a upside down house
---
Whether all the scorched will be gone or not, I like your guess. I myself just can't wait to have the Raiders back in Appalachia and blow their heads off
---
he meant like "hitting them in the face with a rainbow bat", not flirting.
---
and no, it wouldn't really. in modern press only minorities get exposure for discrimination.
---
Ya i have came across one in toxic valley
---
Kill Supermutants in bulk.  West Tek, Harper’s Ferry, etc.
---
Leader bobblehead, well rested bonus, and any easy event, including capping workshops then server hopping. 
---
Same as above plus lots of ammo crafting, but that requires preparations to have the materials on hand. 
---
Server hop West Tek.
---
Looking at your comments on this post and your shitty attitude I wouldn't want to play anywhere near you in game either, and it has nothing to do with your orientation.
---
Riot armor definitely. And helmets should provide actual protection!
---
Its mostly dead on xbox one
---
Love this! I've been struggling to make my camp less boxy, this was some good inspo!
---
Traveling pharmacy, butcher's bounty, green thumb, and lone wanderer are the only perks you can access early that you consistently have any need for.  If you can manage it, it's best not to open any perk packs until you hit level 50 so you get the fewest duplicate perk cards and have a much better chance for the cards you want.  
---
Honorable mention for basher, one of my personal favorite underrated perk cards.  That card is insane with the minigun shredder, and is actually really useful, makes a lot of guns deal hundreds of damage with a bash if they have any bash mods on them (which is meta now anyway as far as rifle stocks go). Early game bashes with a bayoneted pipe gun are going to do more damage than an entire magazine of shots.  And stabbing shit to death with a bayonet just looks satisfying.
---
People are assholes, especially online. They get a power trip from the idea of anonymity, because they can do anything, and they won't be judged by those in their little corner of the world. Don't take it personally, as that's usually all it is, either a power trip, a genuine asshole, or rarely someone that feels uncomfortable, either because they don't know how to interact with you, or they aren't comfortable enough with their own sexuality. Not saying they're closeted, but some people simply aren't comfortable with anyone that they cannot sexually relate to.
---
50 lvls
---
Stop being a brat. Boo hoo if some people don’t want to play with you
---
Just hope 3 of them dont randomly attack my camp anymore
---
Yes on both accounts. I wish I had a way to separate the items I'm keeping for use, keeping for collection, the items I'm keeping to sell but not wanting to sell yet, and the legendary items I'm hanging onto to be able to script.
---
I wish I could drop my keys, not because of weight, not to sell for caps, but because I make sure to empty my inventory of everything other than my main gear, including holotapes. I wish that would also include duplicate keys because it just feels weird, and immersion breaking.
---
I found the key with being able to still melee is to sprint and use vats. Let AP rebuild while you get greens/poop/fires.
---
Weird.  was just thinking this today, i can't be arsed to work it out right now, hopefully somebody already knows.
---
This would be the ease way of going about it, and it would make the most sense.
---
Hmmmm🤔
---
Putting aside that gigantic exaggeration; people have complained about anything that makes this game even moderately difficult.
---
There is a mod for pc where you can type in a number like a normal human instead of using the slider. Not exactly what you're looking for but it's nice.
---
You forget. This is just years after the bombs fell. They haven’t had time to evolve into the deathclaws we’re used to.
---
Murder the ass off of everything you see and sleep until well rested.
---
Im stuck same as u but on abbies bunker except im on xbox one
---
I mean literally max out every perk card.
---
"betterinventory" if you're on PC.
---
“America’s best and brightest”
---
Yep... hopefull somebody does the math :.D
---
Im assuming they told you the amazingly popular turn it off and back on with extra steps?
---
Haha, coincidence or fate?
---
For all the complaining about these, I have seen the Bot at about 85% of the Camps I visit. Maybe about 50% for the fridge.
---
Full disclosure, I have both.
---
Why do gay people sound like that anyway? I don't understand how you voice can be altered just by the way you use your genitals.
---
Do the feed the people when you see it for the canned stew +5 xp
---
you're talking hypothetical now.  I'm not backing anti anything. let's keep to the facts.
---
Every single perk card or slot .. cards idk prob lvl 1k but slots 50
---
Figures as much. Maybe if we get some attention to the issue on their forum they will actually help the paying customers.
---
Early days they could easily perma blind and stagger you due to how often they spammed the attack even while they were flying away from you and looking in another direction, now its only a problem if you don't have a maxed out fireproof or a suit of power armor,and the stagger is shorter and easier to deal with unless you're unlucky enough to come across a flock of 5 of them!
---
On “trash” mobs, don’t expect other players to hold back.  On Legendary mobs, all players should be able to hit it.
---
It's hard to be nice when you constantly are being discriminated against.
---
I'm curious as to what level you need to be to have every version of every perk.
---
It's not about that. It's about acceptance. You are a part of the problem.
---
Just did it 20 minutes back or so.
---
I have a 5 octave vocal range. So I can go super deep and super high. I'm usually on the higher side for comfort.
---
You've got a long road ahead of you in life bud.
---
nope same on PC for me
---
This also true in programming and databasing. The more choices in a drop down list or auto complete field the longer it takes the application to respond.
---
Lol no one is required to accept another human being lol especially on a video game. You’re being a brat if you want everyone to like you
---
I 100% feel this I have had this problem on so many occasions while working on my first character. Personally I feel like that once you rank it up you should be able to tab between the ranks you've unlocked. 
---
With this I also feel like that once you've bought enough duplicates to rank the perk to max rank it also gets taken out of the drop list for perk packs as well. Of course doing this would also mean that those of us who already have those excess duplicates would have to have those removed from our perk inventory and be reimbursed their value in lvl up points.
---
Bethesda’s website tells you the bugs reported and the ones their working on. They’ve been working on this one.
---
I didn’t know The Legion of the Damned were in Fallout... crossover?
---
If we ever get to play on the Flatwoods map again, check out the area out of the initial circle by Sunshine Meadows. there’s almost always a bunch of boxes there too.
---
However, the bags of players who have been eliminated by your hands always hold the best loot. Lol
---
+1 to this.
---
you can't force people to accept you, though. just tolerate your behavior, not embrace it.
---
frankly this is entirely your problem and you're pushing it on other people. report them if they're harassing you, otherwise just move on if they block you.
---
Dump Demolition. Tenderizor and Bloody Mess should be slotted.
---
Right but I meant, and no offence intended, but why do people 'Sound' gay. I know it's a stereotype and I'm not trying to take the piss, but there is a subtle difference in the way gay people talk. Is it something that's learned from other gay people? Or is it just natural?
---
As long as they're in seperate servers sure!
---
542 [ish]
---
eta- less when you take into account opening packs.. 542 is just plugging it straight into nukes&amp;dragons
---
probably somewhere around 500 depending on your rng
---
There are mannequins in the game files with the ATX (atom shop) tag, so its likely

They could do it in the same format that they have the data tab on the pip boy, what you read is in grey &amp; what you haven’t stays on top.

ok, thanks

I agree hell i pay them 200,00 every month for repair kits

I have no issue at all with who is gay straight bi transgender , what’s between someone’s legs and who they like to hook up with is non of my business , and having a friend or acquaintance who happens to be gay doesn’t  have an adverse affect on my life .

Gay people are typically raised in households where they grasp onto the female figure. So they take after them, because they can't really relate with the men. So as they grow up, they alter their voices to be more effeminate. Gay men's voices are not like that by default, it's always them pitching their vocals.

The Ultracite gatling laser plans exist though I have never seen them in 1000 hrs. Pretty rare though I have had quite a few actual UG lasers drop.

Haha.  I'm walking the wastland with a full stash and 1700 lbs on my back.  Enough for anyone, bill gates?

Yet another weapon issue that could be solved by NV style ammo types:
---
Slugs: single shot power for about 150+ range
---
Dragons breath/fire shells: incendiary effect, increased damage
---
Flechette: armour piercing
---
Electric: added energy damage, chance to stun
---
They could add these effect without really reverting to the superior New Vegas hand loading &amp; powder system. A few new mods for increased effects
---
Lol i can do that outside of PA and still take no dammage
---
True... going by the lore I’m hoping they’ll evolve sooner! 
---
Would have been cool to fight one and make the DeathClaw rug instead of buying it with atoms.
---
It only takes one at a time for me which is the last one I picked up triggering it.
---
Yeah it sounds like it might be something like that. I find this stuff pretty interesting!
---
You get it
---
I just whisk it was a quick select like in FO4. I miss that in a firefight.
---
Preston might be immortal and may have existed since 2076
---
oops
---
There are mods for that
---
Yes! And drop curator for *1 of better criticals.
---
I miss the Big MT cybernetics... and talking appliances.
---
Shoot with your camera first.
---
Preston might be immortal, but Killable, he may have existed since 2076, just saying this as a theory since he is unkillable without mods in FO4
---
Gave mine away
